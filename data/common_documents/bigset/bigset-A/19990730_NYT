FOR DODGERS, EVEN THE GOOD NEWS IS BAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The only good news to come out of the Los Angeles
Dodgers series with the Cincinnati Reds became bad news on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Robinson Checo, who pitched five impressive innings
in Wednesday's 9-1 victory, is expected to be placed on the
disabled list with a strained right groin.
</P>
<P>
   Checo, who earned the victory in his first National League
start, was injured on the next-to-last pitch he threw in the fifth
inning. His condition did not improve Thursday and he will be
re-examined today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he could not end up on the DL,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said. ``He hurt his right groin and for a
pitcher that is very serious. If you gamble with that injury, he
could be gone a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Checo, 26, was upset with the news but pleased with his
performance against the Reds. Earlier this season he had made two
relief appearances after coming over from Detroit on April 16 in
the Dave Mlicki trade. His ERA was 17.18.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was here the first time, my mechanics were terrible,''
said Checo, who came in to replace demoted Carlos Perez in the
rotation. ``Now they are in much better shape and I feel I will do
even better next time.''
</P>
<P>
   When that will be is uncertain. Because Monday was an off day,
he was not scheduled to pitch again until Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hubbard again: On July 11, Trenidad Hubbard made his first
major-league appearance as a catcher. Thursday, he played second
base for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick Hits: Todd Hollandsworth started in center field
Thursday in place of Devon White. Although White is batting .383
(31-81) this month, he was 0 for 17 lifetime against Reds starter
Pete Harnisch. White pinch-hit in the eighth against Reds reliever
Gabe White and struck out. . . . Since pitching four scoreless
innings for his first major-league victory, left-handed reliever
Onan Masaoka has hit a wall. He allowed two runs in two-thirds of
an inning Thursday and has given up eight runs in 132/3 innings in
his last nine appearances. . . . Dave Hansen, the Dodgers' top
hitter off the bench, took over for Adrian Beltre at third base in
the seventh and had a two-run single in the eighth. . . .
Thursday's crowd of 32,758 pushed the season attendance to
2,028,356, the 27th consecutive year the club has drawn at least
two million to Dodger Stadium. The team needs to average 33,504 in
its final 29 home games to reach three million. It is averaging
39,007. . . . Eric Karros's homer was his 24th of the season and
12th at home. Mike Piazza holds the L.A. single-season record with
22.

   ATLANTA _ A securities day trader killed nine people Thursday
afternoon in two office buildings in the city's glitzy Buckhead
district, eluded an extensive police manhunt for five hours and
then killed himself in his van after the police pulled him over in
nearby Cobb County. An additional 12 people were injured in the
incident, seven from gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Mark O. Barton, 44, also is suspected in the killings
of his wife and two children from an earlier marriage, whose bodies
were found Thursday in an apartment in suburban Stockbridge, about
15 miles southeast of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A 9-millimeter pistol and a .45 caliber handgun were found near
Barton's body and a computer-generated letter and three notes were
found near the bodies of his wife and children, the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stockbridge killings took place before the Buckhead
shootings, but it was unclear exactly when, said Mayor Bill
Campbell of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of those injured in the Buckhead shootings were in
critical condition at Atlanta hospitals late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, of Morrow, a chemist who took on the high-risk life of
an independent stock trader, also was a suspect in the 1993
bludgeoning deaths of his former wife and her mother in Cedar
Bluff, Ala., the authorities said. He was never charged in those
killings.
</P>
<P>
   No motive was known for the killings that occurred in two
brokerage offices Thursday, the deadliest shooting rampage in the
city's history. Investigators speculated that recent trading losses
contributed to Barton's ire, although they also said he had not
expressed any such motive in the notes he left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened today is a tragedy of massive proportions,''
Campbell said Thursday afternoon, his face locked in a
sweat-dampened grimace. ``We are praying for the families and
praying for our city.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's incident was the third shooting rampage in the
Atlanta area in less than three months. On May 20, a 15-year-old
student at Heritage High School in nearby Conyers took a gun to
school and shot six other students, none fatally, before being
captured. On July 12, an Atlanta man killed six members of a family
and himself in an apparent domestic dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings in the Buckhead business and entertainment
district Thursday began around 2:50 p.m., when Barton walked into
Momentum Securities and, without warning or provocation, began to
fire with two weapons, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were killed in that building.
</P>
<P>
   James Lee, a co-owner of the firm, would not say whether Barton
did business there.
</P>
<P>
   Barton then crossed bustling Piedmont Road and walked into
another brokerage firm, All-Tech Investment Group. He opened fire
there as well, killing five people.
</P>
<P>
   Barton had traded at the office in the past but not recently,
the company said in a statement from its headquarters in Montvale,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Barton ``came into our office and after speaking to the branch
manager, suddenly stood up and for no apparent reason opened fire
on the branch manager and his secretary,'' said the statement from
All-Tech. ``This man then went into our main trading room and began
indiscriminately shooting at our customers. The man then ran out of
our office and continued shooting in another part of the office
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Houtkin, the chief executive of All-Tech, in a statement
on the company's web site, expressed sympathy to the families of
the victims and said: ``No explanation can alleviate our grief or
bring a sense of closure to the horror of these shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   For confused hours after the shootings, the police seemed to
have few clues to Barton's whereabouts or his method of escape.
Aided by SWAT teams, dogs and helicopters, they conducted a
suite-by-suite search of the office buildings and the leafy grounds
surrounding them to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   After officials broadcast a description of Barton's van, Cobb
County police officers saw him driving north on Interstate 75, said
Lt. Lee Schwein of the Acworth police.
</P>
<P>
   As Barton exited at Acworth, Schwein said, Acworth police
cruisers converged on him. He then pulled into a BP service station
and officers blocked his escape.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled to the back of the station, put a .9-millimeter
handgun in one hand, a .45-cal. handgun in the other, and fired
both into his head, Schwein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings a very tragic day to an end,'' Campbell said about
8:20 p.m., after returning to a bank of microphones near the scene
of the shootings. ``I don't know if any of us can understand why
something like this occurs. All we can do is comfort the families
and pray for our city.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the killings of Barton's family members, including a
12-year-old son, Matthew, and an 7-year-old daughter, Michelle,
took place before the Buckhead shootings, Campbell warned that it
was dangerous to assume that Thursday's market fluctuations had
triggered the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this is a deranged individual and has nothing to do
with what occurred today,'' he said. But the mayor did say that the
police had learned that Barton's investments had ``substantial
swings, losses and gains'' and that Barton ``seemed to indicate
some concern about losses.''
</P>
<P>
   In the apartment in Stockbridge, meanwhile, the police said they
found the bodies of the children in their beds, covered except for
a small part of their faces. Notes had been placed atop each body.
Henry County Police Chief Jimmy Mercer said that Barton's wife was
found in a bedroom closet, also covered, with a note on top of the
cover. Another letter, apparently written by Barton on a computer,
was found in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer said that the police believed that Barton's wife was
killed on Tuesday and his children on Wednesday. He said the notes
suggested that the victims died as a result of ``blunt force
trauma.'' He also said the notes mentioned the 1993 killings in
Alabama, but not in the form of a confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost written in a denial phase,'' he said. He did not
say whether the notes specifically warned of Thursday's shootings,
but said, ``There may be reason to believe that this mayhem would
not stop at this particular point.''

TOPEKA SCHOOLS TO CONTINUE WITH DIVERSITY EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. -- Topeka School District officials say they will
continue pressing forward with the district's program to eliminate
the remains of segregation, even without federal court
supervision. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, federal Judge Richard Rogers closed the
Brown vs. Topeka Board of Education case that began in 1951 and
resulted in the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision abolishing the
``separate but equal'' doctrine of segregation across the country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as a milepost, not as a destination,'' Bruce
Mallory, president of the Topeka Board of Education, said
Thursday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert McFrazier, the district's superintendent, joined Mallory
in assurances that the district has ``no ambitions whatsoever to
dismantle the remedies that are in place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a sense relieved, but at the same time we will
maintain the status quo as it relates to the remedies we are
currently under.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his four-page order that was signed Tuesday, Rogers said that
the district had complied with the court's mandates and that ``the
vestiges of past discrimination in the school district have been
eliminated to the extent practicable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His order came as no surprise. Plaintiffs in the case had told
the court they wouldn't object to the district's attempt to end
federal-court oversight of the program to eliminate any remains of
segregation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rich Jones, attorney for the plaintiffs, who has been working on
the case since 1979, said although it was now closed he wouldn't
walk away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As an interested citizen, I'm not going to sit back and watch
any discrimination without saying something,'' Jones said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the time the original action was initiated, Topeka had
segregated elementary schools. Its single high school was
integrated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, the federal court ruled that Topeka had made a
good-faith effort toward complete desegregation, but it entered no
further orders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The case remained dormant until 1979, when attorneys convinced
one of the original plaintiffs, Linda Brown, to be a plaintiff in
an effort to bring the case back before the court. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The case was revived by Rogers, and he ruled in 1987 that the
school district had eliminated all vestiges of the old segregated
school system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in 1989, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Rogers,
and that decision stood through several appeals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Rogers approved a desegregation plan to remedy
remaining problems involving the ratios of white and minority
children as well as the racial mix of faculty members. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1993-94 school year, 13 Topeka schools were classed as
``racially identifiable.'' Three years later the district had no
schools in that category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the district has a minority enrollment of 41 percent,
including 25 percent African-Americans and 11 percent Hispanic.
Fifty-nine percent of the students are white. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mallory said that even though the federal court no longer was
looking over the district's shoulder, that didn't mean any dramatic
changes were planned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a ways to go with the commitment we've made to
the spirit of the Brown case,'' Mallory said. &QL;

SUSPECT IN ATLANTA KILLINGS WAS LINKED TO PREVIOUS VIOLENCE

<P>
   Before he burst into the national news as a frustrated day stock
trader turned suspected killer Thursday, Mark O. Barton had already
been at the center of an extraordinarily violent story.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, his wife and mother-in-law were found beaten to death
inside a camper at a campground in northern Alabama. On Thursday,
the authorities said that although Barton, 44, was never charged,
he was a suspect in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, a Scout master and chemist, seemed to have led an
ordinary life for the past few years in the Atlanta suburb of
Morrow. But neighbors did notice that he seemed intent on keeping
to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was preoccupied,'' said Cindy Northcutt, a neighbor on
Sinclair Place in Morrow, a solidly middle-class suburb about a
20-minute drive from downtown Atlanta. ``He was always short and
brief.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed stand-offish, said neighbors along the street where
Barton and his two children by his first marriage lived with a
woman who the authorities said was his second wife, Leigh. But
until the shooting Thursday, several neighbors said they thought he
was simply busy with some sort of computer work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always on the computer. Always on the phone,'' said
Mrs. Northcutt, a neighbor two houses down.
</P>
<P>
   But Martha Jean DeFreese, whose grandson was a friend of one of
Barton's children, said she had recently noticed something when
Barton came to drive the boys to a Scout meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked a little odd to me,'' she said. ``I said to myself,
`There is something wrong with this man.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barton ran a chemical consulting business out of his home. Last
winter, his wife and his 8-year-old daughter, Michelle, moved to an
apartment in nearby Stockbridge. On the recent Fourth of July
weekend, Barton and his 12-year-old son, Matthew, moved into the
Stockbridge apartment, apparently in at effort at reconciliation.
Bodies believed to be those of his wife and children were found
Thursday in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The new residents of the house at 6475 Sinclair Place said that,
aside from a lot of computers and three or four phone lines, the
scene the Barton family left behind was as ordinary as could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was your average middle-income business person,'' said Gail
Walker, the woman whose family took over the $850-a-month rental
after the Bartons left.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said that Barton usually wore slacks and dress shirts
and that there was little that distinguished him except for his
being well over 6 feet tall and thin.
</P>
<P>
   A few neighbors said they were not even sure if he and the woman
he lived with were married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told she left because he couldn't decide what they
were going to do, whether he was going to settle down and get
married,'' said Lucius Johnson, who lived two doors away.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Earls, who runs a day care center in her home three
doors down from Barton, said the Barton children seemed typical.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the 1993 killings, Barton's first wife, Deborah
Spivey Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59, had
been spending Labor Day weekend without Barton. They were found
inside the camper, which showed no signs of forced entry. While
some jewelry was missing, other jewelry and cash had been left
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview that appeared several months later in The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Bill Spivey, Barton's former
father-in-law, said that Barton had been the perfect son-in-law
until the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then,'' Spivey added, ``we have cooled tremendously
toward each other.''

ATLANTA: particular point. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because the killings of Barton's family members, including a
12-year-old son, Matthew, and an 7-year-old daughter, Elizabeth
Mychelle, took place before the Buckhead shootings, Campbell warned
that it was dangerous to assume that Thursday's market fluctuations
had triggered the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this is a deranged individual and has nothing to do
with what occurred today,'' he said. But the mayor did say that the
police had learned that Barton's investments had ``substantial
swings, losses and gains'' and that Barton ``seemed to indicate
some concern about losses.''
</P>
<P>
   In the apartment in Stockbridge, meanwhile, the police said they

a small part of their faces. Notes had been placed atop each body.
Henry County Police Chief Jimmy Mercer said that Barton's wife was

was found in the living room.

<P>
   Mercer said that the police believed that Barton's wife was

but said, ``There may be reason to believe that this mayhem would

</P>
<P>
   Although Barton was never charged in the Alabama slayings of his
former wife, Debra Spivey Barton, 35, and her mother, Eloise Powell
Spivey, 59, investigators clearly viewed him as a possible suspect.
The two women were found in a trailer at a campground in
northeastern Alabama, hacked to death with a sharp, heavy blade,
according to news accounts of the killings. Barton's lawyer,
Michael R. Hauptman, told WSB-TV tonight that Barton had purchased
a $600,000 insurance policy on his wife shortly before the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   In the office buildings where the shootings occurred, workers
described blood-splattered walls, lifeless bodies and nervous
police officers shortly after the shootings. Many were locked in
their offices for hours as officers searched the buildings, their
weapons drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Dari A. Payrow, 23, a worker at Allegiance Telecom, which has
offices on the third floor of 2 Securities Center, said he was
returning to his office from a bathroom when he found a trickle of
blood in the hall. He glanced through the glass windows of the
building's leasing office, which is adjacent to his own, and saw
puddles of blood on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a guy on the floor and nobody was helping him so I
assume he was dead,'' Payrow said. The man, he said, was face down
with a bullet wound in his side.
</P>
<P>
   Payrow and other workers huddled in their offices waiting to be
evacuated by the police. ``They all had their guns drawn,
bullet-proof vests, guarding corners, near the elevators, running
around our office,'' he said. ``They told all the males in our
office to come out with our hands up and out of our pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, the police escorted officer workers out of the
building and led them down Piedmont Road. Many jogged to safety,
then bided their time in a nearby Mexican restaurant,
</P>
<P>
   Melinda L. Truan, a 49-year-old psychotherapist, sat outside the
restaurant speaking on her cell phone to her boyfriend, Bill J.
Post, who was locked inside one of the Piedmont Center Buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a lot of police activity,'' Post said. ``We just
saw 15 or 20 police and some SWAT members go into Building 8.''

TWO ATLANTA FIRMS ARE LEADERS IN `DAY TRADING' 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The two brokerage houses where a gunman opened fire Thursday in
Atlanta, killing nine people, are among the most well known firms
specializing in day trading, the fast and furious, minute-by-minute
trading of stocks by computer.
</P>
<P>
   With offices in 23 cities across the country, All-Tech
Investment Group Inc., based in Montvale, N.J., is one of the
nation's largest day trading specialists. Momentum Securities, a
day trading firm in Houston, has branches in Chicago, Milwaukee and
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A bull-market phenomenon, day trading has caught the fancy of
throngs of investors who believe they can profit from the smallest
of stock price changes in the course of a trading day. An estimated
5 million investors day trade currently, accounting for 15 percent
of the volume in Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Some trade in offices like All-Tech's in Atlanta, others trade
from their homes. Clients of the roughly 100 day trading firms in
the United States are typically required to put up at least $50,000
to open a trading account. Some firms, including All-Tech, offer
courses in day trading which train interested customers for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   All-Tech Investment Group's chief executive officer, Harvey
Houtkin, has been something of a day trading evangelist. A former
professional stock trader, he started the firm that later became
All-Tech in 1983. He calls himself the father of electronic stock
trading and has written two investing books on day trading
techniques, one with a drawing of a burglar's mask on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Houtkin did not return a phone call seeking comment on the
shootings. But he told The Associated Press that his employees told
him that the suspected gunman, identified by authorities as Mark
Barton, hadn't traded since April.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (the gunman) was a former client,'' Houtkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum Securities, founded in 1995, is run by James Lee, who
is also president of the Electronic Traders Association, a lobbying
group for electronic trading firms. Momentum Securities planned to
become a public company through a stock offering, according to a
news report late last month. It was not known whether Barton traded
with Momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, All-Tech filed plans with the Securities &AMP; Exchange
Commission to issue stock in a public offering but the deal was
never done. At that time, the company said it had approximately
1,500 customers in 22 offices nationwide. These customers made
between 2,000 and 3,000 trades per day, according to documents
filed with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading firms have come under fire in recent months from
securities regulators who believe the firms do not warn investors
adequately about the risks of losing money day trading. In May,
All-Tech settled a complaint brought by the Securities Division of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that a branch office of the firm
in Watertown, Mass., had misled customers with deceptive
advertising and misused customer funds. Matthew Nestor, director of
the Securities Division, said Thursday that the branch had
approximately 130 customers and that the firm's advertising
essentially said that day trading ``was easy, profitable and
anybody could do it.'' In settling with regulators, All-Tech agreed
to pay a $50,000 fine and reimburse customers $228,000, and said it
would not solicit customers from Massachusetts for two years.
</P>
<P>
   At its board meeting Thursday and before news of the shooting
emerged, the National Association of Securities Dealers approved a
measure requiring day trading firms to disclose to their customers
the risks associated with the trading practice. Mary Schapiro,
president of NASD Regulation Inc., said the rule will help protect
investors in an increasingly sophisticated environment.
</P>
<P>
   All-Tech's Web site downplays the risks in day trading. ``The
amount of money you can lose is directly related to your degree of
discipline in following the trading techniques our affiliate
All-Tech Training Groups, Inc., teaches.'' Elsewhere, the web site
stated: ``Electronic Day Trading attracts people dead-ended or
unhappy in their current field of endeavor and people with a desire
to make trading their life's work.''

BAD CALL SETS L.A. BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ That's a neat trick, taking a muddled melange that
finally has a chance at being cleared up, and then leaving it all
the messier.
</P>
<P>
   This is the NFL, where all inconceivable and foolhardy acts are
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Just when everybody is eager to put a happy face on the Los
Angeles bid to acquire the next NFL team, the league decides to
play hardball and Commissioner Paul Tagliabue announces more public
money will be required to close the Coliseum deal.
</P>
<P>
   With one brilliant stroke, everybody is quickly pushed into an
uncomfortable corner that is a threat to kill the whole deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis has long been on record as to opposing any
existing public money to help pay for aquiring an expansion team.
And it would hardly be a politically correct move for him to change
his stance now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want more state money?'' Davis said. ``I stand by my
previous position.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not smart to box a governor in. Davis signaled he was
willing to back bond issues to pay for parking at the state-owned
Exposition Park when he asked Bill Chadwick, an investment banker
who specializes in bonds, to bring the competing ownership groups
together under one directed effort.
</P>
<P>
   You have to feel a little sympathy for Chadwick, who thought he
laid out the framework for an agreement and was led to believe the
league was ready to agree to it. He mistakenly announced to the
press Wednesday after meeting with owners he expected them to sign
off on the deal by the week's end.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the league praised his efforts, the state's
participation . . . and then essentially rejected his deal and sent
him home bloodied and wounded to search for more public money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised when I was told they wouldn't execute
the negotiating agreement,'' Chadwick said. ``But it's no surprise
they want more money. They've been consistently trying to sweeten
the economics for them, and I've been trying to protect the state's
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick said he will spend the next few days going over
numbers, searching for any other ways to generate revenue, and then
meet with Davis over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he'll either say, `OK' or `I think not,' '' Chadwick
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if it is ``I think not,'' that could end your Los
Angeles expansion effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably would,'' Chadwick said.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, there is not much more Chadwick can do. The
league claims its Sept. 15 deadline for Los Angeles to finalize its
franchise bid is firm, which leaves six weeks for the unexpected to
happen and just who to get it done?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Eli Broad?
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ovitz and partner Ron Burkle have been the favorites of
most owners and league officials. Tagliabue reportedly pushed for
owners on the expansion committee to approve Ovitz as the team
owner Tuesday night, but owners said they did not come to Chicago
prepared to make an ownership decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Tagliabue might have unwittingly given Broad an opportunity
to take the lead in the ownership race when he __ the commissioner
_ strangely made public his hard line for more public financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Chadwick has gone as far as he can,'' Broad said. ``He
got the ball moving, but we're at the 10-yard line. Somebody has to
be given the ball to run with and make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to pick an ownership group, whether it's ours or the
other group, to get this done. Someone with the wherewithal and
relationships to get all the parties _ the governor, the mayor, the
NFL _ into one room and have everyone bend a little bit. If they do
that, I think we can get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad, with partner Ed Roski Jr., might be the only one with
both the state and local connections who can hammer out a fast
deal. Broad acts like a man who sees an opportunity. And, of
course, he has the money, which he is willing to put up.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said Thursday he'd give the league $2 million in earnest
money if he is named the franchise owner and given the opportunity
to close the deal over the next 47 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get it done, I'd forfeit it,'' Broad said. ``I'm
not guaranteeing that it will happen, but I have confidence that if
Ed and I were doing it, we'd get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Money is the constantly intriguing element in this whole
unsavory mess. Only in the wacky world of the NFL could a deal
expected to cost $1 billion be on the verge of blowing up because
of $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's the amount that Chadwick proposed as the team's annual
lease payment to help pay off the $150 million needed in bonds for
new parking. The rest comes from a 10 percent ticket surcharge and
parking fees. But owners believe that additional $5 million per
year leaves the team with too little net revenue to effectively run
a Los Angeles franchise, and Broad agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Broad estimates that between the cost of renovating the Coliseum
and paying the expansion fee, that even with the NFL kicking in
$150 million, the team owner will need to put up $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do it,'' he said. ``You get emotionally involved. I
believe it's good for the city and the park. But to invest that
kind of money and then take on an operating deficit, that's nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing can seem plenty wacky. Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas, though, is not about to concede anything. It was
Thomas and Roski who brought the Coliseum back from the dead as a
prospective NFL site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of returning football to the Coliseum was far
more daunting then than the unfinished business before us,'' he
said. ``It's easy to talk about what's left to do and lose sight of
what has been accomplished. I refuse to believe creative minds
can't settle this.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but time is getting precious. And there is yet another
mess to clean up.

SUSPECT IN ATLANTA KILLINGS WAS LINKED TO PREVIOUS VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS: in 9th graf, bgng Barton ran, changes name and age of
daughter to Elizabeth Mychelle, 7.)  (With GA-SHOOT and related stories.)

 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before he burst into the national news as a frustrated day stock
trader turned suspected killer Thursday, Mark O. Barton had already
been at the center of an extraordinarily violent story.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, his wife and mother-in-law were found beaten to death
inside a camper at a campground in northern Alabama. On Thursday,
the authorities said that although Barton, 44, was never charged,
he was a suspect in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, a Scout master and chemist, seemed to have led an
ordinary life for the past few years in the Atlanta suburb of
Morrow. But neighbors did notice that he seemed intent on keeping
to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was preoccupied,'' said Cindy Northcutt, a neighbor on
Sinclair Place in Morrow, a solidly middle-class suburb about a
20-minute drive from downtown Atlanta. ``He was always short and
brief.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed stand-offish, said neighbors along the street where
Barton and his two children by his first marriage lived with a
woman who the authorities said was his second wife, Leigh. But
until the shooting Thursday, several neighbors said they thought he
was simply busy with some sort of computer work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always on the computer. Always on the phone,'' said
Mrs. Northcutt, a neighbor two houses down.
</P>
<P>
   But Martha Jean DeFreese, whose grandson was a friend of one of
Barton's children, said she had recently noticed something when
Barton came to drive the boys to a Scout meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked a little odd to me,'' she said. ``I said to myself,
`There is something wrong with this man.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barton ran a chemical consulting business out of his home. Last
winter, his wife and his 7-year-old daughter, Elizabeth Mychelle,
moved to an apartment in nearby Stockbridge. On the recent Fourth
of July weekend, Barton and his 12-year-old son, Matthew, moved
into the Stockbridge apartment, apparently in at effort at
reconciliation. Bodies believed to be those of his wife and
children were found Thursday in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The new residents of the house at 6475 Sinclair Place said that,
aside from a lot of computers and three or four phone lines, the
scene the Barton family left behind was as ordinary as could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was your average middle-income business person,'' said Gail
Walker, the woman whose family took over the $850-a-month rental
after the Bartons left.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said that Barton usually wore slacks and dress shirts
and that there was little that distinguished him except for his
being well over 6 feet tall and thin.
</P>
<P>
   A few neighbors said they were not even sure if he and the woman
he lived with were married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told she left because he couldn't decide what they
were going to do, whether he was going to settle down and get
married,'' said Lucius Johnson, who lived two doors away.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Earls, who runs a day care center in her home three
doors down from Barton, said the Barton children seemed typical.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the 1993 killings, Barton's first wife, Deborah
Spivey Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59, had
been spending Labor Day weekend without Barton. They were found
inside the camper, which showed no signs of forced entry. While
some jewelry was missing, other jewelry and cash had been left
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview that appeared several months later in The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Bill Spivey, Barton's former
father-in-law, said that Barton had been the perfect son-in-law
until the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then,'' Spivey added, ``we have cooled tremendously
toward each other.''

AT LEAST 10 KC AREA RESIDENTS NOW DEAD IN JULY HEAT WAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Kansas City suffered through the hottest day
of the year as officials on Thursday confirmed that eight more
persons in the area had died of illnesses related to the heat wave,
now in its second week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worried that the death rate will grow, officials upgraded Kansas
City's weather status from heat advisory to heat alert. That kicks
into action several contingency plans for the opening of additional
cooling shelters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The official high for the area was 103 at Kansas City
International Airport, and Thursday was the sixth straight day of
triple-digit readings downtown, where the high Thursday was 106. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ron Steve, of the National Weather Service in Pleasant Hill,
said today would be more of the same, with a high around 100 and a
heat index of 105 to 115 degrees. Relief may be in sight, though,
beginning Sunday, when a cool front is expected to produce highs of
85 to 90, and in the mid-80s on Monday. But WeatherData Inc. of
Wichita was less optimistic; the private forecasting firm predicts
highs of 94 degrees on Sunday and Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before a cool front can move in, though, the heat could claim
more victims. Statewide, the death toll is now at least 27; the
Kansas City area has accounted for at least 10 heat-related deaths
since July 8. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the deaths announced Thursday involved residents of
Kansas City's urban core, most of them near midtown, who were
between 40 and 81 years old. The eighth victim was a 37-year-old
man from Cass County. Two of the victims died Thursday morning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had seven victims who did not leave their home,'' said Dan
Lindholm, chairman of the Kansas City Heat Task Force. ``But
opening more shelters may not help. For some of these victims,
there were heat shelters on their own block but they didn't go to
it. If people don't go, we can't always reach them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Task Force, a group of 16 city agencies headed by the Kansas
City Health Department, monitors temperatures, deaths and area
hospital emergency departments to gauge how the heat is affecting
Kansas Citians. Kansas City has had a Heat Emergency Plan since
1980, when as many as 176 deaths were blamed on one of the worst
heat waves in decades. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Task Force's criteria for a heat alert includes having a
heat index -- a combination of temperature and humidity level -- of
105 degrees by 11 a.m. for two days. But at 4:30 p.m. Thursday,
they threw out the criteria. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As hot as it is, we still haven't been at critical levels,''
said Lindholm. ``But we're responsive to people's needs. Heat
accumulates in the human body. We have a good heat plan, but if we
feel we can impact people's health, we do it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to get out of the heat and into air conditioning,
if only for a couple of hours. If they can't do that, they should
take several cool baths or showers.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, there are three levels of urgency: heat
advisory, heat alert and heat emergency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But only when a heat emergency is declared are cooling shelters
kept open around the clock. Another criteria for a heat emergency
is that the nighttime temperatures not drop below 85 degrees. The
overnight low Wednesday night and Thursday morning was 75 degrees
at Kansas City International Airport but 84 downtown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the heat continues, officials are asking the public to take
an even stronger interest in their neighbors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Had these people been taken to a heat shelter, maybe they
could have been saved,'' Lindholm said of the heat wave's victims.
``But many people will not go to a shelter. You need to get out,
knock on these doors and check on your neighbors. Invite them over
for a few hours. Someone's life could depend on it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Complicating efforts to ensure the safety of homebound
residents, the relief agencies say, is a scarcity of window fans.
On Thursday, the Salvation Army, which is leading the distribution
of fans for 33 agencies, had only a few left. More than 1,100 fans
have been given away this summer, but there is still a long list of
people in need. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to panic,'' said Joyce Schau of the Salvation
Army. ``Right now, we have gone through all the supplies we've had
and we don't expect a new supply until next week.'' She said
donations are needed now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to realize that heat kills easily, especially the
elderly, the very young and those suffering with a medical
condition,'' said Schau, who is also a member of the Heat Task
Force. ``Often, people get entrenched. Either they're too
frightened to leave their homes empty or they don't have a way to a
shelter.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHARE-A-FARE, of the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority,
is offering free rides to cooling shelters during the heat alert
for Kansas City residents who are elderly or disabled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officially sanctioned cooling shelters in the Kansas City area
are at the Salvation Army sites, the Kansas City Public libraries
and the Mid-Continent libraries, said Lindholm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But any public building that has air-conditioning and a
drinking fountain can also work,'' he said, including places like
shopping malls, movie theaters and even the casinos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For residents without air conditioning, staying cool means
staying alive. &QL;

DROSSIN READY FOR THE WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Deena Drossin does not doubt she belongs in the
World Track and Field Championships this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Drossin, 26, passed on the opportunity in 1997, unsure she was
physically or mentally prepared for that level of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult decision, but I didn't look back,'' said
Drossin, who placed third at the U.S. national championships this
summer and now lives in Alamosa, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my best years were ahead of me. I have a lot more
experience and I feel I am ready to compete on an international
level.''
</P>
<P>
   At the national meet, Drossin ran a lifetime-best 32:00.72 in
the grueling 10,000 meters, moving into 12th on the all-time
U.S.-performer list in that event.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her world travels, Drossin said her high school coach,
Bill Duley, remains strong in her thoughts. Duley was at the 1997
national cross country championships, watching Drossin win what she
called the breakthrough race of her career. Drossin took the
8,000-meter race by 35 seconds over nine-time national champion and
former world champion Lynn Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see all my races collectively as a progressio, but it
definitely gave me confidence running up in the pack,'' she said.
``Being up there with highly ranked people was thrilling for me and
to be surrounded by people I care about was really great.''
</P>
<P>
   She visits Duley and her parents Paul and Heleana frequently.
Last year, Drossin presented Duley with a glass-framed singlet; she
had worn the singlet when she won her first national cross country
title.
</P>
<P>
   Drossin wrote: ``Bill Duley, Thank you for molding me into this
sport that has given me so much in return.'' The jersey is
prominently displayed in Duley's running store in Agoura Hills.
Drossin said her years competing under Duley led to her success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always encouraging and I still hold his philosophies to
this day,'' she said. ``I remember him for his excellent coaching,
not necessarily running extra laps for being late for practice, but
mostly showing the fun side of the sport and rewards of running.''
</P>
<P>
   The world championships will be Drossin's toughest test. Along
with adapting to the heat and humidity of Seville, she must run two
quality races in two days if she advances to the finals. Drossin,
who has spent the past month competing in Europe, will train in
Portugal for two weeks prior to the world championships to
acclimate herself to the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   However, it has been in the thin air of Alamosa, Colo., that she
has rediscovered her zeal for running after an injury-plagued
career at Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Training under coach Joe Vigil for the past three years has
rejuvenated Drossin, who enjoys tending to her herb garden or
taking runs along the Rio Grande with her 3-year-old chocolate
Labrador retriever, Aspen, and her boyfriend, marathoner Jeff
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive environment, simple and fulfilling,'' she
said. ``It's the best place for me. I'm training more consistently.
It has allowed me to have a narrower focus instead of worrying
about school and other distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   Running with an all-male group that includes Campbell, former
Agoura teammate Bryan Dameworth (a four-time state champion in
cross country and track), and former area standouts Derek Kite
(Camarillo) and Peter De La Cerda (Granada Hills) has steadily
built her mileage up from 40-50 a week in college to as many as
100.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is one of the finer young distance runners in America,''
said Vigil, who led Adams State to 25 NAIA or NCAA Division II
cross country titles in 28 seasons before retiring in 1993. ``There
are a lot of other girls as talented as Deena, but there aren't
many as disciplined and dedicated. She places things in perspective
and doesn't worry about the competition. She's confident in her
abilities and runs her own race.''
</P>
<P>
   That confidence surfaced when Drossin first began running at age
13. While at Agoura, she decorated her hotel room with signs
congratulating herself the evening before the state cross country
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always a competitor,'' Duley said. ``She had the
ability to dial in on her self-confidence when the pressure was
on.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The issue of gun-control legislation has come back
to life in Congress this week, and to anyone unfamiliar with the
ways of Washington, it might appear that some kind of law is about
to be enacted.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, there may be no law enacted for months.
</P>
<P>
   And whether there is a law probably will have little to do with
the fallout over the shooting in Atlanta and more to do with the
political sensitivities of Washington, some members of Congress
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta bloodshed brought expressions of sorrow and
determination from lawmakers, even though it was not clear by
Thursday night whether the killer had obtained his weapons
illegally, or even whether any gun control short of outright
confiscation could have prevented the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said, ``This terrible tragedy
highlights once again how important it is that we enact meaningful
gun-safety legislation. The American people are demanding action.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject of gun control is fraught with emotion and political
sensitivities, which is why the House and Senate could not agree
when various firearms regulations were debated earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   What happened, basically, was that the Senate passed certain
restrictions, including mandatory background checks on all
customers at gun shows, that were attached to a bill on juvenile
crime.
</P>
<P>
   But the House could not agree on gun control, because some
members thought the various proposals were too strict, other
proposals too lenient. So the House version included nothing about
gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has lain mostly dormant as leaders in the two chambers
took up other battles.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the legislative prospects will become a bit clearer when
the House names its conference committee members on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The members, appointed Wednesday, are Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah,
Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Jeff Sessions of Alabama,
Republicans; and Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts, Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, a Long Island, N.Y., Democrat, said,
``The conferees are going back in and trying to pass what the
Senate passed; hopefully this will be done by next October.'' Mrs.
McCarthy's husband was killed when a gunman opened fire on a Long
Island Rail Road train in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The first obstacle comes after next week when Congress will
recess for four weeks. That means the conference committee will
probably not complete its reconciliation of the juvenile crime bill
until September, or perhaps October.
</P>
<P>
   But it would surprise no one who had watched Congress agonize
over the issue to see the politics of late spring and early summer
re-enacted.
</P>
<P>
   That is, the conferees could get caught up in the paralysis that
stalled the House, and in the end agree on nothing.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the conferees compromise enough to agree on some
kind of gun control, President Clinton had threatened to veto any
measures that he deems too weak.
</P>
<P>
   The president was in Sarajevo, Bosnia, Thursday and had no
immediate comment on the Atlanta bloodshed, but he described
himself as deeply upset in April after the shooting at the high
school in Littleton, Colo.

EDITORIAL: THE SHOOTINGS IN ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CHANGES daughters to children in 4th graf, changes ``in'' to
``is`` in last graf) (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 30: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the fatal shooting of nine people in Atlanta
Thursday can be seen in isolation, as the mad handiwork of a lone
individual venting uniquely twisted grievances through the barrel
of a gun. Yet the incident is also part of a larger and dismally
familiar story of shootings that seem increasingly to pop up out of
nowhere and in the most unlikely places _ in orderly small towns,
in offices, in suburban schools, in genteel neighborhoods and, in
this case, in the commercial district of the well-to-do Buckhead
section of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other thread that connects these shootings to the
others. It is of course hard if not impossible to protect society
from a determined killer camouflaged, as this one was, by his own
ordinariness. But it is also true that there are too many weapons
floating around this country _ 200 million at last count _ and,
because of the continuing failure of our national legislators, too
many ways for people to get their hands on those weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta killer has been identified by police as Mark Barton,
a 44-year-old suburbanite and day trader in stocks who walked into
a brokerage office in the Piedmont Center, made an apparently
casual comment about the drop in stock prices and suddenly opened
fire.
</P>
<P>
   He then walked across the street and started shooting in another
office in the same complex. Nine people died altogether, and a
dozen others were wounded. Later in the day, when the police
spotted his van and pulled him over, he shot himself. He apparently
was suspected but never charged in two murders in 1993. Police
suspect he may also have killed his wife and two children , who
were found dead Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the toll rises, in the workplace and in the schools. Just
last month a psychiatrist in Michigan was shot by a former patient,
who then gunned down a 45-year-old woman and wounded others. In
April, a 71-year-old man raked the first floor of a Mormon library
in Salt Lake City with gunfire from a .22 caliber handgun, killing
two people and wounding four others. In March, a Johnson City,
Tenn., man shot his lawyer and another client in an apparent
dispute over his former wife's will.
</P>
<P>
   Before that were the killings that gave grotesque definition to
the 1997-98 school year _ students dead and wounded in Pearl,
Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Edinboro, Pa.; Jonesboro, Ark., and
Springfield, Ore. All of that seemed but a preamble to this year's
carnage at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. This is an
appalling list, and while there are no easy answers, the failure of
Congress to limit access to weapons among dangerous or unbalanced
individuals is appalling, too.

PAPPAS DEFENDS HIS ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-PAPPAS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Sox doctor Arthur Pappas Thursday defended his
handling of pitcher Tom Gordon's medical care, saying that the Sox
closer was supportive of delaying surgery until other avenues,
including rest and treatment, proved futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently he has decided that people have not been honest
with him,'' said Pappas in an interview on Boston radio station
WEEI. Pappas said Gordon was a full participant in discussions
about his treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This discussion has been had right along. He's very much
wanted to stay involved with the team, contribute to the team if he
could, and then if something had to be done after the season, it
would be done at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, in what you're saying to me, all that is out of
focus and today he has a different opinion than what the discussion
has been about in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Pappas also expressed surprise and disappointment that Red Sox
star Nomar Garciaparra voiced indirect criticism of the medical
treatment Sox players receive.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by WEEI's John Dennis if Garciaparra was qualified to be
critical, Pappas said: ``Well, apparently he feels he is. It's not
uncommon that when someone excels in the athletic arena, everyone
believes their opinion is the accurate opinion all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon in Toronto, after Gordon informed teammates
he probably would require Tommy John tendon transfer surgery on his
right elbow, Garciaparra had loudly criticized the team's medical
staff to his teammates, while reporters were in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our doctors are killing us,'' Garciaparra said to teammates,
then made a reference to the delay last season in diagnosing Lou
Merloni's stress fracture, which was first diagnosed as a bone
bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas, asked if players have second-guessed him to his face,
said: ``Nomar _ I am surprised to hear that from Nomar, but that's
in a moment of stress and his friend (Merloni) not doing as well. I
think that all those are concerns that he has to weigh in whatever
way he wants to.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said told him that he
originally hurt his elbow last November while pitching in an
exhibition series in Japan, had problems with the elbow in spring
training and has since been on the disabled list twice this season,
the last time for six weeks. Gordon was placed on the DL,
retroactive to June 11, when an MRI revealed a small ligament tear
and inflammation of the ulnar nerve.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Pappas prescribed rest and anti-inflammatory
medication. That opinion was supported by Dr. James Andrews, the
Birmingham, Ala.-based orthopedist Gordon sought out for a second
opinion. But six weeks later, Gordon continued to feel discomfort,
and after expressing dismay that Andrews had not received the
results of a second MRI two weeks ago, Gordon was told by Andrews,
who finally reviewed the pictures Wednesday, that the ligament tear
was still present.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon will not pitch for the rest of the season and almost
certainly will have to undergo the tendon transfer surgery to
repair the ligament, a procedure that often requires a year of
recovery time.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas said Gordon was apprised of that possibility throughout
the discussions of his condition, yet preferred to see if more
conservative treatment _ the rest and medication _ would prove
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Tom Gordon had come to me in October last year or early
this year and said, `This is my problem, here are the findings,
then I am sure the discussion would be `I think you should have
this done' and it would have been done,'' Pappas said. ``You'd like
to give all opportunities to the resolution of the problem before
you say `OK, your season is over, it can't work.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think that's the frustration that . . . it gets to the
point where if something didn't resolve, then you go back and say,
`Well, why didn't you do something sooner?' ''

COWBOYS SIGN SPELLMAN TO ONE-YEAR DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Defensive end Alonzo Spellman sped across
the practice field on the passenger seat of a golf cart yesterday
afternoon. The Dallas Cowboys now hope to re-create a similar image
in terms of Spellman running down opposing quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   After much deliberation, the Cowboys signed the 27-year-old,
out-of-work free agent to a one-year, $400,000 contract with an
incentive package that can reach $800,000. The incentives are
categorized as ``hard to make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have to be a monster year to reach them,'' said
Stephen Jones, vice president/director of player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Spellman, who was Mike Ditka's last first-round draft choice in
Chicago (22nd overall, 1992) last played in the NFL for the '97
Bears. In 1998, he encountered a series of highly publicized
emotional problems, including one incident in which he barricaded
himself inside his publicist's home during an eight-hour standoff
with police, and was waived by the Bears three months later.
</P>
<P>
   No other team in the NFL even tried to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done our homework on him, and we're satisfied that he
fits in,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. ``He has given us a
commitment. He does not join our team subject to suspension by the
league. We've checked and confirmed that with the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a player who has had success, and a player who has had
some challenges, and a player who can be very productive for us
without any risk. When we got everything answered that we wanted
answered, it didn't take me 30 seconds to make my mind up.''
</P>
<P>
   Spellman brings to the Cowboys both an upside and a downside of
notable proportions.
</P>
<P>
   He has 27 NFL career sacks. He has what has been described as
the perfect NFL body. He was, and is once he gets back into playing
shape, in the prime of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He also has had a series of off-field behavior incidents caused
by a manic-depressive condition known as bipolar disorder.
</P>
<P>
   As Cowboys coach Chan Gailey put it yesterday: ``You could paint
a picture (of Spellman) about any way you'd want to paint it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spellman's condition can be regulated with medication. The
Cowboys needed a commitment from Spellman that he would stick to
his medication and apparently received one.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also credited Calvin Hill, who oversees the Cowboys'
behavior department, which was established only a few years ago,
with ``providing the resources to allow us to make a decision like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Spellman was in team meetings last night when Jones held a news
conference to announce the signing. Spellman arrived in camp
yesterday after making the two-hour drive from Dallas, where he had
been staying since Monday when he met with both Jones and Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said of his client: ``You have to keep in mind that
Alonzo Spellman's problems have not been willful behavior,''
adding, ``This guy was everything I was looking for in a role
model, then he got sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was reminded yesterday that they passed up wide receiver
Randy Moss in the 1998 NFL draft because they wanted to improve the
team's image, not risk a setback.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the fact that Spellman's problems can be traced to a
bipolar condition treatable through medication, Moss ``required a
No. 1 pick,'' Jones pointed out, while Spellman ``was signed for
the league minimum for a veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jones: ``So is this a departure from what we're doing? Not
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the March 9, 1998, standoff with police which ended
only when ex-Bears Hall of Famer Mike Singletary talked him into
surrendering, Spellman kicked down the door of a hospital the next
day and was found by police wandering in frigid conditions with no
shirt or shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, he was involved in a scuffle with a security
guard at a Detroit hotel, where police reportedly needed pepper
spray to quiet Spellman, who was trying to break up a fight between
two women accompanying him. No charges were filed. He was divorced
that same month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If and when I get to be perfect, then I'll be able to throw
harsh judgment at other people,'' Gailey said when asked about
dealing with Spellman's transgressions. ``But if somebody is
willing to try and do things the right way _ and it doesn't matter
who it is, whether it's this guy or anybody else _ I think
forgiveness and second chances are a part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Spellman hasn't played for so long concerns Gailey
and the Cowboys' coaching staff as much as anything else. Nineteen
months is a long time between putting on pads, which Spellman will
do today for the first time since the end of the '97 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very physical player with great athletic ability. I
just don't know what kind of shape he's in,'' said Cowboys
defensive coordinator Dave Campo. ``He's been out for a year ...
(but) I expect him to play. How quickly he does, we'll have to wait
and see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys believe they've made the right move, the smart move,
for both themselves and Spellman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you take into consideration somebody's past? Sure,'' Gailey
said. ``But I'm much more interested in the present and the future
of a person than forever comdemning somebody for what they've done
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The future for Alonzo Spellman begins today. nn

HOUSE VOTES TO TRIM FUNDS FOR SCHOOL FOR LATIN AMERICAN SOLDIERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted early Friday to withhold
recruitment money for the Army's School of the Americas, a facility
long criticized for training Latin American officers who turned out
to be tyrants and murderers.
</P>
<P>
   The school's graduates include Gen. Manuel Noriega, the dictator
of Panama, now imprisoned in Miami on a drug conviction; the late
Roberto D'Aubuisson, a reputed death squad commander and political
leader in El Salvador, and dozens of soldiers accused of political
killings in El Salvador and Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 230-197, with 56 Republicans joining 174 Democrats
to support the measure, sponsored by Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass.. On
the floor supporters denounced the school as a Cold War relic and
an academy for assassins. The measure would withhold about $1.5
million for recruiting and transporting officers to the school at
Fort Benning, Ga. The school has an operating budget of about $15
million.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came as an amendment to the $12.7 billion foreign aid
bill, which the House began debating Thursday night. The House
adjourned after midnight, postponing until Monday a final vote on
the bill, which would slash nearly $2 billion from the White
House's request, including half a billion dollars aimed at
furthering peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $500 million that the administration had
requested to carry out the Israeli-Palestinian accords reached last
year, the bill would also cut $200 million for a World Bank
subsidiary that provides interest-free loans to the world's poorest
and least-developed nations.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Senate, which passed a similar bill in June, the House
made an unusual acknowledgment of a covert American relationship
with a foreign intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   In a report accompanying the bill, the House criticized American
``support for Peruvian National Intelligence Service.'' It said the
agency had been ``directly implicated in death squad activity'' and
that it ``withholds intelligence from U.S. officials.'' It said
that the agency was not ``accountable to civilian authorities'' and
``is not a reliable partner in he drug war.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign aid bill is primarily a vehicle for direct economic
assistance for American allies overseas like Israel and Egypt. But
it also annually becomes a forum for debate over abortion, birth
control and family planning abroad.
</P>
<P>
   By a 228-200 vote, the House passed an amendment barring
American funds for family-planning assistance from being spent by
foreign governments or organizations that perform abortions,
promote abortion rights or seek to liberalize abortion laws.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment's sponsor, Rep. Christopher H. Smith, R-N.J.,
called the spending of U.S. funds for family planning overseas a
form of ``cultural imperialism.'' He has been trying for five years
to reinstate the restrictions, imposed by the Reagan and Bush
administrations and lifted by President Clinton in 1993. The House
has passed his bill yearly since 1995, but the measure has never
made it past the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of a bipartisan alternative said they hoped to
prevail in a House-Senate conference.

AFI GRANT GIVES WOMAN DIRECT SHOT AT FILM DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDS, this is first in five-part series.) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Not long after dawn, a vintage Thunderbird
lumbered beneath a Ronald Reagan Freeway overpass, the eyes of a
film crew locked on its progress.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was unremarkable except for the credit that will one
day share the screen with it: ``A film by Joanne Small.''
</P>
<P>
   That credit has been an elusive dream for the Studio City
resident ever since she was a teen-age movie buff growing up in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with movies at a young age. I was watching D.W.
Griffith and Charlie Chaplin and John Ford,'' Small said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, Hmmm _ that's what I want to do. I want to be a
director. But I had no idea how difficult that was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   For nine years she's toiled in Hollywood, working as a sound and
film editor, screenwriter and a script supervisor, most recently on
``The X-Files.'' Before that she attended New York University's
graduate film school. Every deliberate step extended her filmmaking
skills as she crafted her path to the director's chair.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday she took a seat.
</P>
<P>
   She began videotaping her project for the Directing Workshop for
Women, an exclusive program of the American Film Institute, the
organization dedicated to preserving and promoting excellence in
movies and television.
</P>
<P>
   As one of eight winners out of about 150 applicants, Small got
approval to begin shooting her movie, ``Joey Was Here,'' a
``Twilight Zone''-esque tale of a young man driving from New Jersey
to Hollywood who gets trapped en route in a surreal service
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AFI has this program, thank goodness,'' she said.
``Finally someone has said, You deserve a break. And I'm very, very
thankful for that.''
</P>
<P>
   AFI gives each winner in the program a $5,000 grant and access
to equipment. Participants can raise up to an additional $15,000
with which they produce a 20-minute short film in five days,
somewhere in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   The women's workshop began 25 years ago with a class of
beginning directors that included actresses Lee Grant and Ellen
Burstyn, and poet Maya Angelou. Grant went on to win an Academy
Award for directing the best documentary of 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The program continues to target women who have excelled in other
areas of entertainment who are looking for a chance to direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the nurturing of talent,'' said AFI chief
executive Jean Picker Firstenberg. ``Very gifted people need an
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other program of its kind specifically for women
who have talent in the profession,'' she said. ``It gives them a
window to directing that is not otherwise available. It's about
that individual vision, and seeing that flower is exactly why we
plant the seeds.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much as she cherishes the program, she hopes one day it's
no longer needed. She said they're making strides, but women are
far from being on an equal footing with men in filmmaking _ only
13percent of the directors in the Directors Guild of America are
women, or 721 out of 5,714 as of Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this community, there are very, very few opportunities for
professional women to make the jump. Now it's my turn,'' Small
said. ``To me, the highest joy I can get is when I'm immersed in
directing. Everybody should want to go to work as badly as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   On the set, a sunbaked dust bowl of parking lot off Rocky Peak
Road, Small darted from the cast-and-crew trailer to the caterer's
tent to the truck towing the cars being used in the movie _
checking on every detail, cheerfully making sure everyone else had
what they needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's everybody doing? Has everybody eaten?'' she asked.
Grabbing her own lunch between takes, she said, ``I've been too
busy to eat. I made a bologna sandwich one night, and every time I
went to take a bite, the phone rang. That bologna sandwich lasted
me an hour and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Carlson, one of the two producers of ``Joey Was Here,''
said he has tried to act as a calming influence on the set. Like
everyone else there, he's working for free _ most are friends of
Small's, helping her out and looking for increased experience
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're excited for her _ it's a great opportunity,'' he said,
adding that she's the one person he hasn't had to calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's probably got it figured out six ways to Sunday,''
Carlson said. ``She's a freak _ she lives, breathes and eats this
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson called Small ``the next Penny Marshall,'' referring to
the former ``Laverne and Shirley'' star who went on to direct
feature films including ``Big,'' ``Awakenings'' and ``A League of
Their Own.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Small, he said, ``I've seen her vision. She's got the goods.
</P>

   ``This is going to be her calling card,'' Carlson said. ``This
is the first project that's going to have `Directed by Joanne
Small' on it.''
</P>
<P>
   But first Small has to make it to Monday. And her lead actor
quit to take a paying job, her wardrobe mistress had a car break
down on the way to the shoot, and the Agoura Hills City Hall might
close before she gets permits to film there Monday.

Like 61, 755's days may be numbered
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Here they go again. Mac and Sammy. Sammy and Mac. Dinger derby,
the sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, minus the trumpets of a year ago, Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa have muscled their way through the hoi polloi to reclaim
their rightful place atop the home-run standings. It's a dead heat.
Mac has 37 and so does Sammy.
</P>
<P>
   That's four more than anyone else in the chase. That's also a
61-homer pace, formerly a magical number. Had 1998 never happened,
the hysteria would be building.
</P>
<P>
   But we're jaded, aren't we? After The Great Race, which saw
McGwire (70) and Sosa (66) turn Roger Maris into a historical
footnote, the laddies are going to have to jack a whole bunch more
before anyone gets too overheated. Until one or the other reaches
60, preferably before the end of August, it's almost a non-story.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   But such are the wretched excesses of our day. And, in the age
of andro, no records are safe, even Henry Aaron's.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerin' Hank went yard 755 times, obliterating Babe Ruth's
``unbreakable'' 714, one of sport's most famous numbers. Yet there
are six active players who must be considered reasonable threats to
surpass Aaron _ and McGwire and Sosa, ironically, are closer to the
bottom than the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's problem is he's 35. Were he to hit 60 this year, he
still would need to average 48 for the next five seasons to bump
Aaron into second place. Even for Big Mac, the only player besides
Ruth to average that many over half a decade, such a feat so late
in one's career would be a lot to ask.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sosa, 30, supposing he also whacks 60, he would need a
little more than 42 per for the next 10 seasons to climb Hank's
majestic mountain. Both, nonetheless, seem solid candidates to join
the Babe and Aaron in the 700 club.
</P>
<P>
   We have to look to the Junior Circuit, and specifically to the
young man we call Junior, to find the gravest threat to Aaron. Ken
Griffey Jr., based on the prodigious pace he has set during his
first decade of ripping through the American League, should wind up
as the greatest home-run hitter ever.
</P>
<P>
   His target number is, yikes, 800.
</P>
<P>
   If Griffey stays the course he's on, he'll finish the season
with 52 homers for a career total of 402 before his 30th birthday.
Assuming he can play until he's 40, and there's no reason to
believe he can't considering his fat-free body, he would have to
average a shade over 36 for the next 11 years to get there.
</P>
<P>
   At 30, Aaron had ``only'' 366 home runs, Willie Mays 319 and
Ruth 309. Mays wound up third on the all-time list with 660.
Notably, Jimmie Foxx had 379 and Mickey Mantle 374 when they were
30. But Foxx's career would be torn asunder by World War II and he
finished with 534. Mantle, a physical wreck late in his career,
ended his chase at 536.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Griffey, three other mighty twentysomething American
Leaguers _ Juan Gonzalez, Manny Ramirez and Alex Rodriguez _ can't
be summarily dismissed as contenders for Aaron's throne.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' Gonzalez, 29 like Griffey, has bashed 40 or more
homers the past three seasons and he's on track to up his streak to
four. Still, he would need 10 more years at 42 per to surpass
Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' Ramirez, 27, belted 45 a year ago and has 27 to
date. Thirteen more seasons at 43 per and he's in Henry's face.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's precocious Mariners teammate Rodriguez, 23, might have
the best shot of all. Assuming he hits 40 this season _ he has 23 _
17 more seasons at 36 per would put him there. At present, he's
averaging just under 34.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Rodriguez seems a lock to destroy the record
for dingers by a shortstop. Cal Ripken's 345 and counting is tops,
but A-Rod figures to blow by 350 before he turns 30. Nomar
Garciaparra, 26, is well off Rodriguez's pace, but he probably has
350 home runs in him.
</P>
<P>
   Lively balls, puny pitching, shrinking ballparks and high-tech
muscle-building are conspiring to jeopardize most of the position
homer standards save for perhaps pitcher (Wes Ferrell, who was
rarely pinch-hit for, smacked 36) and third base. Mike Schmidt's
hot-corner total of 539 (548 overall) appears unreachable.
</P>
<P>
   With 142, Roberto Alomar, 31, will push Ryne Sandberg (270) at
second base. With 220, Mets catcher Mike Piazza, 30, is within
striking distance of Carlton Fisk's 376.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs sell tickets and, at today's salaries, the clubs need
to sell as many as they can. Nobody will be dumb enough to try to
de-juice the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mac and Sammy aren't freaks of nature. Rather, they're on the
front end of what figures to be a long-term long-ball trend.

LAKERS WILL RE-SIGN FOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the signing period just two days away, the
Los Angeles Lakers are moving swiftly toward retaining free agents
Rick Fox and Derek Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the team indicated the Lakers are ready to
offer Fox a multiyear deal starting at just over $3 million.
Contract length is the only remaining issue, with Fox seeking a
maximum six-year deal that would total close to $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fox seems likely to get his wish. The 30-year-old forward has
twice turned down more lucrative offers elsewhere to to sign with
the Lakers, and the team is apparently planning to reward his
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's prospects for staying are less certain, but his agent
is optimistic a deal will be reached after meeting with general
manager Mitch Kupchak on Thursday. The Lakers presented Fisher,
their starter for most of last season, an initial contract offer
Thursday, in a face-to-face meeting with Fisher and agent Elbert
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   According to Crawford, contract length will not be a stumbling
block, but the Lakers' first offer is short of what other teams
have offered. Toronto, Indiana, Miami, Orlando and San Antonio are
among the teams pursuing the three-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between the Lakers' offer and Fisher's target salary is
``not very significant,'' Crawford said. ``I wouldn't say it's an
ungodly amount of difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the offer indicated to Crawford that the Lakers, in
transition under new coach Phil Jackson, might not be totally
committed to bringing Fisher back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's still some questions there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The parties will probably speak again today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic something can get done,'' Crawford said. ``The
willingness has to be on the Lakers' part. They made an offer today
that wasn't a bad offer, it wasn't a good offer.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA teams have been negotiating with free agents since July 1
but have been prevented from signing deals or making trades until
Aug 1.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A securities day trader killed nine people Thursday
afternoon in two office buildings in the city's glitzy Buckhead
district, eluded an extensive police manhunt for five hours and
then killed himself in his van after the police pulled him over in
nearby Cobb County. An additional 12 people were injured in the
incident, seven from gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Mark O. Barton, 44, also is suspected in the killings
of his wife Leigh, and two children from an earlier marriage, whose
bodies were found Thursday in an apartment in suburban Stockbridge,
about 15 miles southeast of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A 9-mm pistol and a .45 caliber handgun were found near Barton's
body and a computer-generated letter and three notes were found
near the bodies of his wife and children, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stockbridge killings took place before the Buckhead
shootings, but it was unclear exactly when, said Mayor Bill
Campbell of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of those injured in the Buckhead shootings were in
critical condition at Atlanta hospitals late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, of Morrow, a chemist who took on the high-risk life of
an independent stock trader, also was a suspect in the 1993
bludgeoning deaths of his former wife and her mother in Cedar
Bluff, Ala., the authorities said. He was never charged in those
killings.
</P>
<P>
   No motive was known for the killings that occurred in two
brokerage offices Thursday, the deadliest shooting rampage in the
city's history. Investigators speculated that recent trading losses
contributed to Barton's ire, although they also said he had not
expressed any such motive in the notes he left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened today is a tragedy of massive proportions,''
Campbell said Thursday afternoon, his face locked in a
sweat-dampened grimace. ``We are praying for the families and
praying for our city.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's incident was the third shooting rampage in the
Atlanta area in less than three months. On May 20, a 15-year-old
student at Heritage High School in nearby Conyers took a gun to
school and shot six other students, none fatally, before being
captured. On July 12, an Atlanta man killed six members of a family
and himself in an apparent domestic dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings in the Buckhead business and entertainment
district Thursday began around 2:50 p.m., when Barton walked into
Momentum Securities and, without warning or provocation, began to
fire with two weapons, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were killed in that building.
</P>
<P>
   James Lee, a co-owner of the firm, would not say whether Barton
did business there.
</P>
<P>
   Barton then crossed bustling Piedmont Road and walked into
another brokerage firm, All-Tech Investment Group. He opened fire
there as well, killing five people.
</P>
<P>
   Barton had traded at the office in the past but not recently,
the company said in a statement from its headquarters in Montvale,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Barton ``came into our office and after speaking to the branch
manager, suddenly stood up and for no apparent reason opened fire
on the branch manager and his secretary,'' said the statement from
All-Tech. ``This man then went into our main trading room and began
indiscriminately shooting at our customers. The man then ran out of
our office and continued shooting in another part of the office
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Houtkin, the chief executive of All-Tech, in a statement
on the company's web site, expressed sympathy to the families of
the victims and said: ``No explanation can alleviate our grief or
bring a sense of closure to the horror of these shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   For confused hours after the shootings, the police seemed to
have few clues to Barton's whereabouts or his method of escape.
Aided by SWAT teams, dogs and helicopters, they conducted a
suite-by-suite search of the office buildings and the leafy grounds
surrounding them to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   After officials broadcast a description of Barton's van, Cobb
County police officers saw him driving north on Interstate 75, said
Lt. Lee Schwein of the Acworth police.
</P>
<P>
   As Barton exited at Acworth, Schwein said, Acworth police
cruisers converged on him. He then pulled into a BP service station
and officers blocked his escape.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled to the back of the station, put a .9-mm handgun in one
hand, a .45-cal. handgun in the other, and fired both into his
head, Schwein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings a very tragic day to an end,'' Campbell said about
8:20 p.m., after returning to a bank of microphones near the scene
of the shootings. ``I don't know if any of us can understand why
something like this occurs. All we can do is comfort the families
and pray for our city.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the killings of Barton's family members, including his
children identified by Henry County police as a 12-year-old son,
Matthew, and an 7-year-old daughter, Elizabeth Mychelle, took place
before the Buckhead shootings, Campbell warned that it was
dangerous to assume that Thursday's market fluctuations had
triggered the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this is a deranged individual and has nothing to do
with what occurred today,'' he said. But the mayor did say that the
police had learned that Barton's investments had ``substantial
swings, losses and gains,'' and that Barton ``seemed to indicate
some concern about losses.''
</P>
<P>
   In the apartment in Stockbridge, meanwhile, the police said they
found the bodies of the children in their beds, covered except for
a small part of their faces. Notes had been placed atop each body.
Henry County Police Chief Jimmy Mercer said that Barton's wife was
found in a bedroom closet, also covered, with a note on top of the
cover. Another letter, apparently written by Barton on a computer,
was found in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer said that the police believed that Barton's wife was
killed on Tuesday and his children on Wednesday. He said the notes
suggested that the victims died as a result of ``blunt force
trauma.'' He also said the notes mentioned the 1993 killings in
Alabama, but not in the form of a confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost written in a denial phase,'' he said. He did not
say whether the notes specifically warned of Thursday's shootings,
but said, ``There may be reason to believe that this mayhem would
not stop at this particular point.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Barton was never charged in the Alabama slayings of his
former wife, Debra Spivey Barton, 35, and her mother, Eloise Powell
Spivey, 59, investigators clearly viewed him as a possible suspect.
The two women were found in a trailer at a campground in
northeastern Alabama, hacked to death with a sharp, heavy blade,
according to news accounts of the killings. Barton's lawyer,
Michael R. Hauptman, told WSB-TV Thursday night that Barton had
purchased a $600,000 insurance policy on his wife shortly before
the killings.

</P>
<P>
   In the office buildings where the shootings occurred, workers
described blood-splattered walls, lifeless bodies and nervous
police officers shortly after the shootings. Many were locked in
their offices for hours as officers searched the buildings, their
weapons drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Dari A. Payrow, 23, a worker at Allegiance Telecom, which has
offices on the third floor of 2 Securities Center, said he was
returning to his office from a bathroom when he found a trickle of
blood in the hall. He glanced through the glass windows of the
building's leasing office, which is adjacent to his own, and saw
puddles of blood on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a guy on the floor and nobody was helping him so I
assume he was dead,'' Payrow said. The man, he said, was face down
with a bullet wound in his side.
</P>
<P>
   Payrow and other workers huddled in their offices waiting to be
evacuated by the police. ``They all had their guns drawn,
bullet-proof vests, guarding corners, near the elevators, running
around our office,'' he said. ``They told all the males in our
office to come out with our hands up and out of our pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, the police escorted officer workers out of the
building and led them down Piedmont Road. Many jogged to safety,
then bided their time in a nearby Mexican restaurant,
</P>
<P>
   Melinda L. Truan, a 49-year-old psychotherapist, sat outside the
restaurant speaking on her cell phone to her boyfriend, Bill J.
Post, who was locked inside one of the Piedmont Center Buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a lot of police activity,'' Post said. ``We just
saw 15 or 20 police and some SWAT members go into Building 8.''

COWBOYS' HUTSON SPRAINS KNEE, WILL BE OUT TWO TO FOUR WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys' offensive line
suffered a setback Thursday when reserve offensive lineman Tony
Hutson suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right
knee that is expected to sideline him for two to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hutson had been tabbed to replace right guard Everett McIver,
who is still recovering from a torn anterior cruciate ligament that
cut short his 1998 season. McIver is not expected back until late
August.
</P>
<P>
   Backup center Mike Kiselak, who played some guard last season,
could be the leading candidate to fill in for Hutson. The other
options are rookie second-round pick Solomon Page and first-year
players Freddie Childress and Chris Brymer. ANOTHER SPORT FOR
DEION?
</P>
<P>
   Injured cornerback Deion Sanders reported to camp Thursday with
the rest of the veterans, looking to add to his list of sporting
endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Already a documented football and baseball player and avid
fisherman, Sanders initially looked to be taking a cue from Lance
Armstrong, as he rode onto the practice field during the morning
practice on a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a long conversation with Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones regarding his rehabilitation progress from April toe surgery,
Sanders revealed that he was playing basketball as a part of his
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all very curious,'' Jones said. ``He's been running and
playing a little basketball. It causes him to get on his toes
pretty good. But he's cautious. He's getting some strength that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Sanders' return is concerned, Jones said, ``the facts
are we don't know anymore about when he will play. It's looking
good, but that's all we can say.'' HELLESTRAE BACK FOR ANOTHER YEAR
</P>
<P>
   In the mood to save money, the Cowboys seriously considered life
without deep snapper Dale Hellestrae.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take the Cowboys long to change their mind, thus
Hellestrae reported for his 10th training camp with the team
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said Hellestrae, considered one of the
league's best deep snappers, is hard to replace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale is very good at what he does,'' Gailey said. ``He has
created a good niche that is tough to replace. He has set a
standard that's hard to top.'' IRVIN AND THE OFFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Just when Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin thought he had the
team's intricate offense down, coach Chan Gailey threw him for a
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he implemented only about 85 percent of his massive
playbook last year. He plans to give the rest of it to the team
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That scares me,'' said Irvin, who said he's just getting the
85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he plans on putting in more, that tells you what kind of
work I have to do.'' FROM RIVALS TO PALS
</P>
<P>
   Aggies and Longhorns across the state would be astonished to
learn that former Texas receiver Wane McGarity and former Texas A&AMP;M
linebacker Dat Nguyen have become fast friends since joining the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The two have almost been inseparable at training camp _ riding
to lunch together and going to and from practice together.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen said it's a natural relationship, as he's known McGarity
since the two took a recruiting trip together as seniors in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was going to come to Texas A&AMP;M,'' Nguyen said.
</P>
<P>
   McGarity would have none of that. He said he likes Nguyen. His
only problem with his new friend is that ``he's an Aggie.''

FROST'S LEGACY LIVES ON 10 YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 FROST-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a Sunday afternoon of oyster gray skies and drizzle at the
1989 Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo, Lane Frost eased atop a snorting
bull named Taking Care Of Business.
</P>
<P>
   At the final performance of the sport's equivalent to a
Wimbledon stage, the 1987 world champion bailed off the bull after
eight seconds and rolled onto the soggy soil. Taking Care Of
Business uncharacteristically then charged and plunged his mammoth
ivory horns in Frost's back. The hit didn't break the skin, medical
officials said, but caused massive internal bleeding, ending
Frost's life within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Frost's legacy lives, however.
</P>
<P>
   Friday is the 10th anniversary of his death at age 25. A
ceremony honoring Frost is scheduled during the afternoon
performance of the Wyoming rodeo's 103rd edition.
</P>
<P>
   Frost envisioned spurring the sport to another level. Today, the
top performers sew on as many sponsorship patches as their
bulletproof vests can hold while competing on a nationally
televised tour. In Frost's era, when there were only a handful of
high-profile bull-riding shows, a souped-up series was only a gleam
in a bull rider's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lane was ahead of his time,'' said Kellie Macy of Post,
Frost's wife at the time of his death. ``For his age, he was way
further along in years than most competitors in that he realized
the importance of promoting himself and rodeo.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since Frost's death, rodeo has adopted many of its
practices and formats from more popular sports using Frost's
lifestyle as a model. Three examples:
</P>
<P>
   A national tour: In 1985 and 1986, Frost competed on the Winston
Tour, a series of shows that featured the sport's marquee
competitors in bucking stock and timed events, such as calf roping
and barrel racing. But the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association
voted to end the tour in 1987, which irked marketable athletes such
as Frost, Tuff Hedeman and Dave Appleton.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after Frost's death, Hedeman, who was Frost's best
friend and traveling partner, became the founding patriarch of
Professional Bull Riders. The PBR offers a 29-city, $5.5 million
tour in North America. Today, the PRCA has plans to re-employ a
tour format for its high-profile athletes, commissioner Steve
Hatchell said.
</P>
<P>
   A Bull vs. Cowboy promotion: In 1988, Frost engaged in a
best-of-seven series against a bull named Red Rock. The bull, which
had never had a qualified ride on his back after 309 tries, was
brought out of retirement for the series against Frost on the West
Coast. Frost stayed aboard Red Rock four times.
</P>
<P>
   Today, highly touted showdowns commonly are staged in addition
to the regulation rodeo. Hedeman's PBR show in March in Fort Worth
featured a $10,000 match between a marquee bull and rider. If the
bull wins, its owner collects; if the cowboy wins, he's secured the
highest spin atop the Wheel of Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the PRCA landed a bounty bull program with a national
automobile dealership. Riders collect for staying on a bull for the
required eight seconds. Each time a designated bull bucks off a
rider, the bounty increases $500. After bucking off 43 consecutive
riders, the bounty for staying on the Mesquite Championship Rodeo
bull, Dodge Durango, is a record $30,500.
</P>
<P>
   The necessity for protective equipment: Frost was not wearing a
protective vest when he died. Ten years ago, virtually no
competitor wore protective gear. Today, almost every bull rider
does.
</P>
<P>
   Frost's death might be the most dramatic event in rodeo history.
With his rugged good looks, his charismatic personality and his
championship form on rodeo's roughest event, Frost was the ultimate
package for sponsors and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fleming, the PRCA communications director of the past two
decades, said Frost, who notched only one world title, is more
prominent than cowboys with multiple championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``His smile was infectious,'' Fleming said. ``He was like a
grown-up little kid with his good manners. His achievements, along
with his personality, the way he died and where he died make him
legendary.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedeman, who became one of rodeo's most marketable athletes from
modeling his career after Frost, said if his friend were competing
today he would be in the thick of lucrative title-race hunts on the
PBR tour and would rope in huge sponsorship packages.
</P>
<P>
   Frost's legacy accelerated down a network of other trails. His
biography is portrayed in the Hollywood movie Eight Seconds, with
Luke Perry playing the lead role. Songs, poems and books testify of
his legend. Rodeo achievement awards beam a neon Frost label.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40,000 Bibles that feature a picture of Frost riding
have been mailed from Frost's family church in Southeastern
Oklahoma; his parents say that Lane's faith in Christianity has
gained numerous converts after Lane's life testimony is read from
the Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   Frost's family are spokespersons for his legacy. His parents,
Clyde and Elsie Frost, live in Lane, Okla., and make numerous
public appearances at rodeos and church services.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Kellie Macy, married two-time National Finals team
roper Mike Macey and they are rearing their two small children in
the West Texas town of Post. Hedeman, who broke the news of Frost's
death to his wife and parents from Cheyenne by phone, lives on a
ranch in Morgan Mill and presides over the PBR.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the fatality, Kellie Macy said: ``What Tuff and I
have done is show that you can triumph over what happened and not
be bitter.'' nn

HOLTZ FINDS WEIGHT OF NEW JOB AT SOUTH CAROLINA REQUIRES HUMOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ All that was missing was a couch and Johnny
Carson or Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
   As the new coach at downtrodden South Carolina, Lou Holtz is
back on stage and in the spotlight. He dominated both as the final
speaker at Thursday's Southeastern Conference football media days.
As always, humor was a major component of Holtz's 41-minute
interview session.
</P>
<P>
   Laughter is one way to camouflage the Gamecocks' considerable
shortcomings. Holtz, who has a national championship, 216 victories
in 27 seasons at five previous college coaching stops, is now in
charge of a program that has as many Heisman Trophy winners as bowl
victories (one of each).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an answer to every problem. Can we find the answers?''
Holtz said. ``All I'll promise is, we won't forfeit. We will win at
South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   When Holtz speaks before a pack of rapt reporters, he seemingly
has a one liner for each of his coaching victories. The trick is
reading between the lines.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz loves to run the ball. His son, Skip, left a good job at
Connecticut to become his father's offensive coordinator. ``My son
loves to throw the football. He'll call the plays until we throw 11
passes and then I'll call 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   First joke, first translation: ``Lou Holtz will do what it takes
to win. In his mind, that means a dominant running game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches told me not to take this job because you can't win at
South Carolina. So why did I take the job? The psychiatrist who
examined me asked the same question.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``Holtz left Notre Dame in 1996 with a bad taste.
His ego demands he turn around one more program before he
retires.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what would be a good season, Holtz answered: ``In all
honesty, winning a national championship.'' That of course, brought
laughter. Holtz knows a comedian's biggest asset is his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``Holtz knows he doesn't have the talent to win
now. And playing in the SEC's East Division, the best that South
Carolina can usually hope for is finishing fourth behind Tennessee,
Florida and Georgia. But that doesn't mean he won't try.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of Holtz, South Carolina's first two games
(North Carolina State and Georgia) will be televised by ESPN and
ESPN2. ``I've been asked why. I said they're trying to reduce the
amount of violence on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``Holtz wants the emphasis placed on the players.
But since he was hired Dec. 4, interest in Gamecocks football has
been at an all-time high. And that's because of the new coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 1-10 record, South Carolina's average attendance was
more than 74,000. ``We raised more money per victory than any
school in America.'' Translation: ``Holtz knows that Gamecocks fans
are loyal and spoiled for a winner. He believes he can supply it.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's opener at N.C. State and the Oct. 16 game
against Arkansas in Little Rock, give Holtz a pair of coaching
homecomings. The near-fatal throat cancer of his wife, Beth, is
under control. His hair is just as sandy blonde, though his glasses
appear a bit thicker. Holtz looks primed for one more coaching
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the competition in the SEC, this is probably the
most difficult job I've ever taken,'' the 62-year-old Holtz said.
``I'm not a young man. This is not an eight-year rebuilding
program.''
</P>
<P>
   During his 11 seasons at Notre Dame, Holtz was famous for a lot
of things. One was poor mouthing his team's chances against Navy or
Army and the other was building up each week's opponents so that it
appeared that the Irish were playing a schedule full of national
championship contenders.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. In his first season at South Carolina,
when Holtz denigrates his team and praises the opponent, he'll be
closer to the truth. nn

WAC COMMISSIONER SAYS LEAGUE HAS CHANCE TO SURVIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING AND JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a brand-new conference heading out after a shattering split,
the WAC has adopted a new slogan: ``Mapping A New Course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may wonder if we are just a collection of schools in a
holding tank,'' said commissioner Karl Benson, ``but conferences
mean loyalty, and with these eight schools and a ninth (Nevada)
joining next year, I think we finally have it. We can also identify
the necessary steps to success.''
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among these, Benson said, is a television contract with
Fox that guarantees no upfront revenue but gives the WAC what it
needs most: visability.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is revenue potential if the format succeeds,'' Benson
said, ``but the important thing now is exposure, not revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   The network will provide three national telecasts: TCU-Arizona
on Sept. 5, Fresno-SMU on Oct. 14, and SMU-TCU on Nov. 26, plus
four regional games. The only WAC team left out of the package is
UT-El Paso because of a scheduling problem.
</P>
<P>
   The second step, Benson said, is the bowl package. The WAC
champion will play in the Las Vegas Bowl on Dec. 18 _ ironically,
against the No. 2 team from the Mountain West Conference, composed
of former WAC members. Another WAC team will play in the Mobile
Bowl on Dec. 22, against a Conference USA opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the first engagement, Benson said, ``This provides us with a
great opportunity to send a message that the WAC is not a
stepchild. I hope we fill Sam Boyd Stadium and make it hard for
them to turn their back on us (it's a one-year deal).''
</P>
<P>
   The Mobile Bowl, he said, ``is primarily interested in one of
the WAC teams in the Central Time zone (TCU, SMU, Rice, Tulsa)
rather than those on the West Coast.'' In 2000, the WAC champion
will play in the new bowl (Silicon) in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   After noting a variety of new facilities being built around the
league, Benson was asked if the WAC could erase its ``stigma'' of
being regarded as second-rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a stigma?'' he said. ``It's a perception. You erase
the stigma by changing the perception, and that's what we're going
to do.'' RAINBOW OF A NEW HUE
</P>
<P>
   Describing his job, new Hawaii coach June Jones said, ``We have
a long road ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow Warriors were 0-12 last year and are working on an
18-game losing streak. They have lost 24 consecutive WAC road
games.
</P>
<P>
   As a starting remedy, Jones has installed the run-and-shoot and
turned over about half of the personnel, and brought in 25 to 30
walk-ons. WAC WHAT?
</P>
<P>
   SMU coach Mike Cavan, for one, remains dry-eyed at the breakup
of the 16-team WAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you,'' he said, laughing, ``I'm not real
sure I could name all 16 schools.'' UTEP'S `FREAK'
</P>
<P>
   UTEP coach Charlie Bailey, on 6-foot-5, 300-pound Norwegian
defensive end Leif Larsen, reputed to have broken a national record
by bench-pressing 225 pounds 50 times: ``He's kind of a freak of
nature.'' PUNTER COMING BACK
</P>
<P>
   TCU coach Dennis Franchione doesn't consider himself a ``phone
person.'' But he had maybe his best phone conversation in a while
last Saturday when the Horned Frogs' wayward punter, Royce Huffman,
called to say he'd likely be back to play his final season.
</P>
<P>
   Huffman was drafted by the Houston Astros in June and has been
playing in a summer league on the East Coast. Franchione wasn't
sure if Huffman would return for his final year of eligibility.
Huffman wasn't sure either.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he called and said he'd be back by Aug. 20th or 21st,''
Franchione said.
</P>
<P>
   Good news, too. The Frogs have him slated as the starting punter
and wide receiver. nn

`OCCY' UPSET BY BRAZILIAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. _ A few minutes elapsed, then boom!
</P>
<P>
   The biggest upset in professional surfing this season just came
down at the Huntington Beach Pier.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Mark Occhilupo, a surf legend who was leading the
World Championship Tour, lost in the second round Thursday to
unranked Brazilian Neco Padaratz, who made Occhilupo the first
surfer eliminated in the Gotcha Pro by beating him 20.65 to 20.l5.
In this second round, the top seed lost to the 32nd seed.
</P>
<P>
   Occhilupo's heat was the first of the day, starting at 8:40 a.m.
He failed to wait for better waves, which left him continually
playing catch-up to Padaratz.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest mistake was taking the first wave because it didn't
have much potential,'' Occhilupo said. ``That could have changed
the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Occhilupo usually is referred to by his nickname, ``Occy.''
After missing several years on the tour in the mid-'90s after an
emotional breakdown, he came back for the 1997 season and he
finished second in what the WCT called ``the greatest comeback in
surf history.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Occhilupo's loss is a major upset, but those who know
surfing don't consider it a surprise. Occhilupo is known as a power
surfer, so he often does not thrive on the 2- to 3-foot waves at
Huntington.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Padaratz is unranked also is deceiving because he
was ranked as high as 10th last season. However, he had ``personal
issues'' and left the tour. So, Padaratz, 22, is trying his own
comeback and he appears much as he did last season, with the
exception of newly bleached blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the Gotcha Pro, Padaratz finished the highest of
the unranked surfers in last week's U.S. Surfing Open at Huntington
and received a wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   Padaratz's fellow Brazilian, Fabio Gouveia, who advanced over
San Clemente's Shane Beschen in his heat, wasn't surprised by the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can beat everyone,'' Gouveia said. ``He's really angry.''
</P>
<P>
   But Padaratz's victory might be overshadowed by Occhilupo's
early exit. Occhilupo nearly advanced in the first round on
Wednesday but lost to Australia's Luke Egan, 19.65 to 19.10.
</P>
<P>
   __ Random waves: The wave conditions at Huntington have been
erratic. Some surfers have gotten steady, solid waves, while others
have spent nearly their entire 25 heat minutes waiting for a
respectable wave. Australia's Todd Prestage had average waves in
his 21.35 to 15.15 victory over fellow countryman Matt Hoy.
</P>
<P>
   __ The cut: On Thursday, 16 competitors of the 48-surfer field
were eliminated. The field will be cut in half today, starting at 7
a.m.

FOX SPORTSWEST2 BLACKOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have reached Game 14 in the Los Angeles Dodgers hostage
crisis, and co-conspirators Fox and Charter Cable show no signs of
releasing their prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   That would be you, any Dodgers fan who are cable customers of
Charter. You have now missed 14 Dodgers games on Fox Sports West2
(FSW2) since July 6, when the regional cable outlet began airing
alternate programming because of an impasse with Charter. Game No.
15 comes Sunday, and five more games are slated to be yanked on the
Dodgers' next road trip.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, here's the background. The Dodgers in
January announced they would televise 80 Dodgers games on FSW2 this
season, doubling the number from 1998. Around the same time, FSW2
officials told cable operators there would be a 25-cent surcharge
for the added games.
</P>
<P>
   Charter was one of several operators that balked at the
quarter-per-customer-per-month surcharge, but all of the others
have since come to terms, leaving Charter to fend for itself.
Charter and Fox officials have met often since the issue flared in
June, when FSW2 announced it would replace Dodgers games with other
programming beginning July 6.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line for viewers: You haven't seen the Dodgers on
FSW2 since July 1, there's no evidence a deal is coming, and the
same blackout/alternative program situation is about to begin with
Angels telecasts on Fox Sports West (FSW) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides report a steady stream of complaints from viewers,
and both sides have tried to explain their side of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   A Charter spokesmen said this week that the quarter surcharge
Fox wants works out to a $250,000 hit over the course of a year.
Charter has approximately 78,000 subscribers, and doesn't want to
pass the fee along to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's my analogy,'' erstwhile Charter sports director John
Craig said. ``Let's say I order a hamburger, and the waitress says
the price has gone up a quarter because of the price of pickles. I
say `I don't want pickles.' But the waitress says that doesn't
matter, the price is the same whether or not I want pickles. Now is
that fair?''
</P>
<P>
   It's at least food for thought. Craig also noted that several
years ago, when Dodgers games were televised on Cablevision, a pay
cable outlet, the buy rate was less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reliable way to determine how great the demand is
for Dodgers games by Charter subscribers. FSW2 and FSW both are
part of Charter's ``expanded'' cable tier, which also includes
ESPN, Nickleodeon, CNBC, MSNBC, A&AMP;E, Fx, Lifetime, MTV, USA
Network, BET, Bravo, Sci-Fi, The Food Network and The Learning
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The price for that package is roughly $30 a month, and about 90
percent of Charter's 78,000 take it. Doing the math, Charter
grosses $2.1 million a month from that package, or around $25
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point we've tried to make to Fox is that we already have
an existing contract, and we shouldn't have to charge those people
who don't want Dodgers games,'' Charter vice-president Pete Eliason
said. ``We've tried to talk Fox into a season or game-by-game (pay)
package, and said we'd bear the cost of making the system work, but
they declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten a lot of calls, although I wouldn't say we've
been swamped. I know one thing: If we raised our rate (25 cents),
we'd get 10 times the number of calls we're now getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox officials are as frustrated as anyone that the issue has
dragged, especially since they struck deals with other opertors
very quickly. Part of the Charter problem is that negotiations have
also included Charter outlets and Fox regional nets in other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Fox dismisses Charter's suggestion of a pay tier as irrelevant;
they're in the basic cable business, not the pay TV business. And
as far as Charter balking at a surcharge, they note that the price
of ESPN (NHL) and ESPN2 (NHL) has increased because of expanded
programming packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers need to know that even with the surcharge, Charter's
cost to carry FSW and FSW2 is less than its cost for ESPN and
ESPN2,'' Fox spokesman Steve Webster said. ``And we offer the home
teams I think most people in Southern California want to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Webster also noted that while Fox and the Dodgers are part of
the same family, they don't necessarily share the same pocket.
Major League Baseball (as well as tax laws) require that broadcast
fees be accounted for even if there is a relationship between the
club and carrier. Broadcast sources say the per game rights fee for
every Dodgers telecast on FSW2 is between $200,000 and $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it is is frustrating,'' Webster said. ``I sort of feel
like a fool every time I say `They're still negotiating.''' Chances
are he still feels better than Long Beach's Dodgers fans.
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW THE NEWS: Boxing fans will have to dig much deeper into
their pockets to see the Oscar De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad fight. The
PPV price has been set at an all-time high of $49.95. ... The
Lakers remain one of NBC's favorite teams despite their swoon last
season. They're one of four teams that will play the maximum 11
games on NBC. Defending champ San Antonio, New York and
Philadelphia are the others. NBC will have 34 telecasts next
season, an all-time high, and half of them will be in prime time
(at least in the East). ... ABC airs the ``Shootout at Sherwood''
Monday live in the East, meaning David Duval and Tiger Woods will
tee off at 5 p.m. Actually, the plan is for them to actually start
play at 4 p.m., meaning the TV show will pick them up in progress.
This was done because of concerns they couldn't play 18 holes in
three hours, or before sundown. The event has a provision allowing
it to be stopped early (like after 16 holes) in case they run out
of sunlight or time. Gotta love those made-for-TV spectaculars.
Also: The winner makes $1.1 million, the loser $400,000. Where do I
sign up to be the loser?
</P>
<P>
   __ Rumor control: Fox and ABC-ESPN plan an aggressive bid for TV
rights to Wimbledon. NBC wants to retain its over-the-air rights,
but it is disappointed with ratings the last few years, and isn't
interested in a package bid including cable. HBO chose not to renew
its cable package. Also, CBS and the NCAA are talking about
extending their NCAA basketball tournament package, even though the
current contract has three years remaining ... VCR recommendation:
ESPN Classic on Saturday reruns the five-part documentary
``Brooklyn Dodgers: The Original America's Team.'' All five
episodes will run beginning at noon. ... Tour de France winner
Lance Armstrong will be featured in a documentary next year
produced by Olympic filmographer Bud Greenspan. ... The 1999-2000
NHL TV schedule will include 102 regular-season games on ESPN2, 27
on ESPN and just four on ABC, not including the All-Star game on
Feb.6. That game will be ABC's first telecast. The four others will
be late-season Sunday telecasts. ESPN will air a series of Sunday
night games, a la its Sunday evening NFL and baseball series, and
ESPN2 adds more West Coast late games to its slate. ABC will air at
least one playoff game each weekend, as well as Games 3-7 of the
Stanley Cup finals. Games 1 and 2 will be on ESPN.

SANDERS RETIREMENT DOUBTFUL

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  Barry Sanders, at a mere 31, at a personal cost of $10
million, at only 1,458 yards away from breaking Walter Payton's
all-time NFL rushing record of 16,726, retiring permanently?
</P>
<P>
   Oh please, Barry, you silly, spoiled, preposterous, irrational,
nonsensical phony, you're just like everyone else these days in our

</P>
<P>
   You just can't tell the truth.

boss, Richie Phillips, is of publicly admitting he made a
disastrous tactical error by having his members hand in their
resignations and thereby costing at least 22 of them their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   You're about as likely to retire as Kevin Malone is of making a
trade for the Los Angeles Dodgers that makes sense, or of Bob
Graziano making a decision that doesn't invite ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   You're about as likely to retire as Terry Collins is of finding
peace and tranquility this season with an Anaheim Angel team whose
lousy pitching is exceeded only by its lousy attitude.
</P>
<P>
   You're about as likely to retire as Mike Tyson is of ever
regaining the form that once made him the most intimidating fist
fighter on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the time being, Barry Sanders will persist with his
retirement lie, instead of just coming out and telling the truth
that he wants more money from the Detroit Lions and that he
despises Bobby Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one does take a hair-raising risk in actually telling
the truth i.e., betraying one's honest feelings on a sensitive
subject in this obscenely politically-correct era in which the most
innocuous utterance is liable to get you in trouble with some
segment of society.

   The wide-spread condemnation of the UCLA players who illegally
used handicap parking passes has been well-deserved.
</P>
<P>
   So was the punishment meted out to them by the court system
$1,500 in fines and 200 hours of community service and by the UCLA
coach, Bob Toledo suspensions in the Bruins' first two games,
against Boise State and Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   There is no one condoning what these athletes did, but the
savagely shrill reaction and the outrageously moral posturing by
some critics is far disproportionate to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, these UCLA players didn't mug, rape, rob, or murder
anyone, nor did they bilk anyone out of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   They are a bunch of young, silly college students who committed
a foolhardy act I'm sure they now deeply regret. But they also
should be forgiven and not continue to be treated as though they've
been convicted at the International War Crimes Tribunal at The
Hague. ...

WAC ANOINTS TCU AS ITS `FLAG-BEARER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Maybe the funniest part was that Fresno State
defensive back Payton Williams wasn't joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at TCU,'' Williams said, ``we see a team that is
what we want to be like.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the Western Athletic Conference had 16 teams
and the media gathering spanned two days, programs were scrambling
to schedule, not emulate, a TCU football team coming off a 1-10
season.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Horned Frogs found themselves not just favored to
win the scaled-down eight-team WAC, but being hailed as the ``flag
bearer'' for the beleaguered conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good sign,'' TCU coach Dennis Franchione said. ``I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   It's at least a sign that WAC folks didn't miss the Frogs' 7-5
finish in 1998, including their nationally televised upset of
Southern Cal in the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're aiming at us now,'' said Horned Frogs safety Reggie
Hunt, who was voted the preseason defensive player of the year by
the media. ``But they're going to have to aim pretty hard, be a
pretty straight shooter because as hard as we've been working we're
aiming to have an even better record this year. So they've got to
fight pretty hard to get one because it's not going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Player after player said the Frogs were the team to beat. They
were picked to finish first in the media poll, followed by Fresno
State, SMU, and Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Coach after coach beginning with Fresno State's Pat Hill said
the Frogs also had distinguished themselves as the ``flag bearer''
for the conference with their victory against USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the bowl game, I had given a little bit of thought
that we were kind of carrying the WAC flag a bit,'' Franchione
said. ``I thought if we could play well or win, which we did, we'd
give our new version of the WAC a little bit of credibility, which
it needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we needed that whether it was TCU or Rice or Fresno.
Our eight schools needed that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The WAC was still reeling from the announcement by eight of the
16 schools that they planned to leave the conference to form what
has become the Mountain West Conference when the Frogs were
selected to go to the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's victory was a victory for the WAC, according to
commissioner Karl Benson. It also turned the Frogs into the marquee
name in the conference. Want proof? Look at the WAC's television
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for Fox Sports Net to broadcast three WAC games
nationally and five games regionally. TCU has two of the three
national games, the season opener against Arizona on Sept. 5, and
the season ender against SMU on Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said the WAC needs a good showing in these games to be
able to go back to Fox next year and try to get a more financially
beneficial deal. This is a big year for the WAC, he says.
</P>
<P>
   So the pressure is on, and the flag has been placed in the hands
of a team that is a season removed from a 1-10 finish.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Frogs ready for the pressure of being the favorite
instead of the underdog?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's one of the questions that is still out there to
answer,'' Franchione said. ``Learning to win is one thing and
learning to live with winning is another. Obviously, how I handle
this team and how much pressure I put on them is important. They
are going to hear the fans, but they are going to listen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   His message is simple.
</P>
<P>
   While it looks a lot has changed in the past year, a lot has
stayed the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not too far removed from 1-10,'' Franchione said, ``and
we're not too far away from having a really good year.'' nn

PITCHING, HOME RUNS LIFT RANGERS, 3-1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Rangers general manager Doug Melvin drove from
Charlotte, N.C., to Pulaski, Va., after his flight was canceled
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that allowed Melvin the time to ponder whether making a
trade for a starting pitcher would enhance the Rangers' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, right-hander Mike Morgan, the Rangers' No. 3
or 4 starter, presented an argument against making a move while
pitching six masterful innings in hitter-friendly Oriole Park at
Camden Yards during a 3-1 victory against the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, would Baltimore's Juan Guzman, St. Louis' Darren Oliver,
Colorado's Darryl Kile or Kansas City's Kevin Appier help the
Rangers significantly in the postseason?
</P>
<P>
   And what would it cost to acquire one of those pitchers?
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, who went to evaluate the Rangers' rookie-league
affiliate in the Appalachian League, earns his living making such
decisions. This one likely will be made before Saturday's 11 p.m.
trade deadline, although it remains to be seen what Melvin will
decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any need to change six for a half
dozen,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``I know something
about our five guys. They're giving us a chance to win a lot of
ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers strengthened their lead in the AL West to nine games
and moved 19 games above .500 on the strength of Morgan's
performance and solo home runs from right fielder Roberto Kelly,
shortstop Royce Clayton and catcher Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Doug is going to make a trade,'' Oates said.
``I don't think it's imperative that we make one. I'm for it if it
makes us a better ballclub, but I don't think Doug is going to make
a trade just to make one.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who allowed one run on three hits and two walks, beat
the Orioles' Guzman Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guy pitched better than he did,'' said Oates, who also
acknowledged that Morgan might have pitched six scoreless innings
if not for a fly ball Kelly lost in the sun. That resulted in a
fourth-inning triple for the Orioles' Mike Bordick and led to their
lone run.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Orioles manager Ray Miller appeared much less impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound disrespectful, but this is the kind of
game you can count on scoring runs off Morgan,'' Miller said.
``We've got really good numbers against him. I'm not being
disrespectful, but this is a game where you think you're going to
score some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, though, nipped the Orioles' only other legitimate
scoring opportunity in the sixth inning. Morgan induced an
inning-ending, double-play ground ball from Bordick with two
runners aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to keep a close eye on him,'' Oates said of
Morgan, 39, pitching in the 94-degree heat. ``Mike is a
well-conditioned athlete, but he's not 22 years old anymore. He
went out and gave us six strong innings, but he was sucking for air
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Mike Venafro and right-hander Jeff Zimmerman served
as the bridge to closer John Wetteland with two innings of perfect
relief, and Wetteland pitched a scoreless ninth for his 31st save.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers don't appear to need help with pitching like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this entire clubhouse has a different feel,''
right-hander Aaron Sele said. ``It almost seemed like we were
waiting for a trade to be made last year, and we made it and got
three pretty good players (Todd Stottlemyre, Royce Clayton and Todd
Zeile) who helped us win. It doesn't feel like we're waiting for a
trade to be made this year. We're just going out and playing good
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Lee Stevens echoed Sele's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Doug is going to force a trade just to make
one,'' Stevens said. ``I'll take my chances right now with what
we've got. Why wouldn't we? We feel we can win. We feel we can beat
anyone.'' nn

BURKETT WANTS A SHOT TO PITCH IN POSTSEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Right-hander John Burkett, the only pitcher to win a
postseason game for the Texas Rangers, wants that opportunity again
in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to pitch well enough the rest of the way so I can
start a playoff game,'' said Burkett, who is 3-2 with a 4.57
earned-run average since rejoining the rotation June 24. ``I want
to be a part of it. It's hard to be a part of it if you're not
starting, setting up or closing. I sat and watched last year, and
I'd prefer not to do that again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the way I'm throwing the ball, but the first
order of business is winning this division.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett (3-5, 6.16 ERA) took the loss in the Orioles' 8-6
victory Wednesday, but the 34-year-old pitched significantly better
than the box score indicated. Burkett allowed six runs on eight
hits despite being in command most of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he did a good job of changing speeds and keeping
them off balance,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``In his
five-plus innings, only two balls were hit decently. Other than
that, every base hit was a flare that fell in or a ball just inside
the line down the third-base line.'' NEW APPROACH FOR CRABTREE
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed batters continue to baffle right-hander Tim
Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   So, expect Crabtree to begin pitching right-handed batters
differently instead of relying solely on his sinking, two-seam
fastball that travels in the mid-90s and bears in on the hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right-handed hitters are taking the same approach against
me,'' Crabtree said. ``I have to make right-handed hitters aware
that I can pitch away.''
</P>
<P>
   That means Crabtree will show right-handed batters his slider
and four-seam fastball more often in an attempt to counteract their
success. Right-handed batters are hitting .370 (34-for-92) against
Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Crabtree said. ``Johnny is bringing me in
to get right-handed hitters out, and I'm just not getting it
done.'' ZEILE PREFERS NOT TO SIT
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates originally planned to give third baseman Todd Zeile
the day off yesterday and replace him in the lineup with reserve
infielder Luis Alicea.
</P>
<P>
   Oates, though, asked Zeile after Wednesday's game whether the
hot-hitting infielder would prefer to play. Zeile, who is hitting
.434 (23-for-53) since the All-Star break, accepted Oates' offer to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy is going like he is ... Well, if he were
struggling, he wouldn't have had a choice,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile went 1-for-4, but that snapped his streak of three
consecutive multiple-hit games. nn

ANGELS DEAL PAIR TO A'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels made a trade Thursday
night, but it wasn't the deal that has been anticipated for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Chuck Finley is still an Angel _ for now. Instead, the
Angels sent second baseman Randy Velarde and starting pitcher Omar
Olivares to the Oakland A's for three minor-leaguers. The Angels
got pitcher Elvin Nina and outfielders Jeff DaVanon and Nathan
Haynes in exchange for their most consistent player and pitcher
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde is hitting .306 with nine homers and 48 RBI, and
Olivares is 8-9 with a 4.05 ERA in 20 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Sending Velarde seems to be a sign the Angels are about to trade
Finley to the Indians because one of the players the Angels would
like in return is speedy second baseman Enrique Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Both Velarde and Olivares are free agents at the end of this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Nina, a right-hander from the Dominican Republic, was a
17th-round pick of the A's in 1997. DaVanon was a 26th-round pick
of the A's in 1995, and Haynes was chosen the first round of the
supplemental draft in '97. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eric Taino found only the surroundings familiar,
not the level of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Taino, a former All-American at UCLA playing in only his second
ATP Tour event, lost to Andre Agassi, 6-2, 6-3, in the second round
of the Mercedes-Benz Cup on Thursday night at UCLA's Los Angeles
Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi converted 26 of his 27 service attempts in the second
set, and also stung Taino with a strong two-handed backhand from
the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't complain about any part of my game right now,'' said
Agassi, who advanced to the quarterfinals today to face 18-year-old
Australian star Lleyton Hewitt, a 6-3, 6-1 winner over Germany's
Axel Pretsch.
</P>
<P>
   Taino, a former doubles player in college who made the Mercedes
main draw as a qualifier, answered Agassi's shots well at times but
fell behind a break early in the first set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the score says I didn't come close to winning, but I
accomplished a lot of the things I wanted to accomplish,'' Taino
said. ``Hopefully this is just the beginning for me, and this won't
be the last time you see me in a tournament like this playing
against great players.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi controlled the second set, but the players held serve
until Agassi broke to go up 5-3 and served out the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took my a while to get used to the rhythm of his swing,''
Agassi said. ``He has a good backhand, but he needs to work on
tightening up his forehand.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's feature match, Agassi faces Hewitt, who continued an
impressive run by reaching the quarterfinals of a tournament for
the sixth time this year. Hewitt, ranked No. 33 in the world, beat
Pretzsch in 57 minutes and has dropped only nine games in four sets
at the Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big opportunity for me,'' said Hewitt, trying for
his third ATP Tour title. ``I'm looking forward to facing Andre,
I'm definitely going to have my work cut out.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be the first challenge this week for Hewitt, who broke
Pretzsch to open the match and won the last three games to close
out the first set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bit of a tough start because I felt I could have been
up a double break early,'' Hewitt said. ``I was up 3-2 serving, and
he made a couple good shots to break me, but I was able to get my
concentration back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt cracked three aces in the first game of the second set
and dropped only nine points in the seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt's countryman Andrew Ilie, ranked No. 61 in the world,
beat big-serving Goran Ivanisevic, 6-4, 6-4. Ivanisevic's serve
consistently topped 120 miles-per-hour, but Ilie countered with a
sharp backhand and never faced a break point on his own serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to concentrate on holding my serve and staying in the
first set,'' Ilie said. ``I just wanted to hang in there and get a
better look at his serve and try to make him play the ball and
think about his second serve a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   The first scheduled match of the day was not contested after
Magnus Larsson withdrew due to tendinitis in both forearms. Anthony
Dupruis was awarded the walkover victory and will face Ilie today.

CORRECTS DAY OF UNVEILING TO THURSDAY STED OF WEDNESDAY  
 AIRTOUCH INTRODUCES ACCESS TO INTERNET VIA CELL PHONE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEATTLE _ AirTouch Cellular, a provider of digital phone
service, on Thursday began offering direct Internet access from
computers through its cell phones at no extra charge in three
regions of the United States, including Western Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Claimed to be the first such service in this country, AirTouch's
Net Access also premiered in Detroit and in Salt Lake City, where
it underwent trials for two years before Thursday's unveiling.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Seattle, one of the nation's most competitive cell phone
markets, none of the seven providers appears to offer a similar
service. Sprint PCS and US West said they plan to do so later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Seybold, a telecommunications analyst in Boulder Creek,
Calif., said the service is ``an invaluable tool for many
professionals and business people who can't afford to wait to
access vital information.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Net Access requires a Qualcomm 860 cell phone, which
retails for about $149, and a $25 cable to connect the phone to a
computer's serial port. Most AirTouch customers don't already own
those phones, which came on the market only a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Once physically connected, an AirTouch customer dials (pound
sign) 777 from the computer's dialer and is typically on the
Internet within five seconds, AirTouch said. That connection time
compares with the 35 or 40 seconds needed with dial-up modems.
There's no ring and no handshake, just a direct connection.
</P>
<P>
   The connection operates at a maximum rate of 14.4 kbps, about
one-third the speed of the 56-kbps modems found in most computers.
But one trial user found the speed difference wasn't pronounced or
annoying, especially with e-mail and other text.
</P>
<P>
   The direct Internet connection means customers can't check their
e-mail with a specific Internet service provider. To do that, they
can dial their ISP directly rather than using the (pound sign) 777
direct connection, though that entails a longer wait to connect.
</P>
<P>
   Net Access is an alternative to using older technology: A
specialized external modem connecting a computer to a cell phone.
Conventional PCMCIA cards and other internal modems can't be used
with cell phones, because they lack error-correction software, said
Bruce Cech, manager of AirTouch's wireless data applications.
</P>
<P>
   Special wireless modems usually sell for between $300 and $500,
and the top speed of the connections they make is generally 9.6
kbps, possibly hitting 11 kbps close to a cellular tower, Cech
said.
</P>
<P>
   Net Access took two years to engineer and test, the company
said. The most difficult task was integrating direct Internet
access into the cellular network. The technology underlying that
network _ called CDMA, for Code Division Multiple Access _ is
designed to work better with data than a competing technology
called TMDA (Time Division Multiple Access) used by AT&AMP;T Wireless
and other service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Though it won't cost customers extra, AirTouch anticipates Net
Access will increase its revenue stream, because customers
typically spend 12 minutes on a data call _ four times longer than
on a voice call, said spokeswoman Lisa Bowersock. AirTouch
typically charges customers between 10 cents and 25 cents per
minute, depending on volume.
</P>
<P>
   In a second phase of Net Access, scheduled to be in place by
year-end, the company plans to let customers use their handsets as
simplified Internet browsers, dispensing entirely with the
computer. A browser from Phone.com is already built into the
Qualcomm 860. A third phase will allow wireless transactions
online.
</P>
<P>
   Net Access will be rolled out to the entire AirTouch network,
which serves 9 million customers, by year-end.

PIERCE COUNTY JUDGE REMOVED BY STATE COURT FOR MISCONDUCT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT GAVIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. _ The Washington state Supreme Court on Thursday
ordered the removal of a Pierce County judge charged with selling
part of a client's estate at a cut-rate price and accepting more
than $30,000 in payments on the judge's Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   The decision against Grant L. Anderson marks the first time a
Superior Court judge has been removed from the bench since the
state adopted its judicial discipline system in 1980. It is also
the first time in memory the Supreme Court has ordered a tougher
sanction than recommended by the state Commission on Judicial
Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-member panel this year recommended that Anderson be
censured, suspended and required to complete ethics training. The
Supreme Court, however, makes the ultimate decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Anderson's misconduct has eroded the integrity and
respect for the judiciary to such a degree that he must be relieved
of the duties of office,'' the court said in a unanimous opinion.
``The commission's recommendation of suspension for four months
without pay is too lenient, and removal from office is the
appropriate sanction.''
</P>
<P>
   The misconduct cited by the court occurred shortly before
Anderson began his first Superior Court term in 1993. Then a lawyer
and part-time municipal judge in Fircrest, near Tacoma, Anderson
sold part of a dead client's estate at a reduced price to a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The friend later made $31,185 in loan payments on Anderson's new
Cadillac El Dorado, secretly paying $800 a month from Jan. 1993 to
May 1995, according to court documents. The friend deducted the
payments from his company's taxes as a business expense.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Anderson and his lawyer, Kurt Bulmer of
Seattle, were unsuccessful Thursday. Anderson, who denied
wrongdoing during disciplinary proceedings, has 14 days to ask the
court to reconsider. He can continue to serve during that time,
according to the Supreme Court clerk's office.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's removal of Anderson ends a three-year process that
began when Douglas Schafer, a Tacoma lawyer, contacted the
Commission on Judicial Conduct with information about Anderson's
actions. Schafer Thursday expressed relief at the decision, but
said he was concerned it took so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was clearly a serious misconduct case, and obvious right
from the start,'' he said. ``The disciplinary system is not
functioning correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling also spares the state Legislature from moving
forward with its own removal proceedings. Lawmakers last session
approved a resolution to begin the proceedings if the Supreme Court
did not oust Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Had the court accepted the Judicial Conduct Commission's
recommendation, it would have been only the second time in state
history _ the first in 108 years _ that the Legislature had tried
to remove a judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court stepped up and made the right decision,''
said Senate Majority Leader Sid Snyder, D-Long Beach, who sponsored
the resolution. ``He didn't deserve to remain on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder pressed for the judge's removal after a hospital in his
district claimed that Anderson's handling of his client's estate
had cost it $1.5 million. Ocean Beach Hospital in Ilwaco, the
estate's prime beneficiary, later settled with Anderson and others
for $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson maintained throughout the proceedings that he acted
properly. He said the loan payments were a gift from a friend. He
also argued that the alleged violations were insignificant, not
worthy of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, however, cited Anderson's lack of remorse as
additional proof that he was unfit to serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Anderson's failure to acknowledge or recognize that he
committed any misconduct at all weighs heavily against him,'' the
court said. ``It demonstrates his disregard for the importance of
the integrity of the judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   David Akana, executive director of the Commission on Judicial
Conduct, said this is the first time in memory, possibly the first
time ever, that the court has imposed a tougher sanction than the
commission. The court, the ultimate authority, has overridden the
commission's recommendations before, but always to lighten
punishment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Akana said Anderson is the first Superior Court judge removed
from the bench since voters passed the constitutional amendment in
1980 creating the current disciplinary system. A lower court judge,
King County District Court Judge John Ritchie, was removed from the
bench in 1994 for billing taxpayers for vacations to Florida and
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the Supreme Court also supported the removal of Pierce
County District Court Judge Mark Deming for sexual harassment.
Deming, however, resigned before the decision, and later lost a bid
to be elected again.

PLAYERS FLEE TO RIVALS, UPSET ALABAMA FANS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Alabama fans are whipping themselves into a
frenzy because two Crimson Tide players are transferring to the
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   In June, wide receiver Eric Locke, a Tennessee native, left
Alabama to play for Tennessee. Linebacker Travis Carroll, a Florida
native, announced this week he is leaving Alabama. He hasn't
announced his new school, but it is expected to be Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama coach Mike DuBose is trying to calm the Tide fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alabama's not for everybody and everybody's not for Alabama,''
DuBose said Thursday at the Southeastern Conference football media
day. ``We'll miss both of them. And both of them left for totally
different reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke was seeking more playing time. Carroll, projected as the
team's middle linebacker, has had trouble with a shoulder injury
and was uncertain that he would be happy if he stayed and was
unable to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are any underlying problems,'' DuBose
said. ``The focus has been on them instead of the rest of the
players who are busting their fannies to get ready for the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   DuBose said it was university policy not to release players from
their scholarships when they decide to transfer to another SEC
school. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ After playing in the 1998 SEC championship game, Mississippi
State is being picked fourth in the SEC West this year. However,
Bulldogs coach Jackie Sherrill hints that his team could be a
surprise. ``Our goal was to replace the offensive linemen we lost
and we did that,'' he said. ``We're better off than we ever have
been. But the SEC West, it's another coin flip as far as who could
win it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Kentucky coach Hal Mumme doesn't appear concerned that Dusty
Bonner will be taking over for record-setting Tim Couch at
quarterback. ``We're not going to cut back on the number of
plays,'' he said. ``If anything, we'll expand the playbook. Dusty
is a bright guy who has studied the playbook for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin says he looks forward to
playing at Florida's ``Swamp'' on Sept. 18. The game will be played
at night and televised by CBS. ``I don't think he knows what he's
in for,'' Florida wide receiver Travis Taylor said. ``There's going
to be 85,000 people who just came from Happy Hour. It's gonna be
loud. Plus, there's going to be 11 Florida players out there trying
to take his head off.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Alabama senior running back Shaun Alexander, a Heisman Trophy
candidate, prepared for his senior season with a rigorous summer
workout program. Part of his workouts included acceleration
training on a treadmill. ``I got up to 23 mph,'' he said. ``I tell
people that would get me a ticket in a school zone.'' nn

OPENLY GAY MINISTER PICKED TO LEAD SEATTLE EPISCOPAL CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN IWASAKI  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A priest known for his energetic work on social
justice issues will be named Friday as dean of St. Mark's Episcopal
Cathedral in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood, becoming the
first openly gay man in the country chosen to head an Episcopal
cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Taylor, 40, was forced to flee his native South
Africa in 1989 with the help of Archbishop Desmond Tutu because of
his work against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   In his current post in New York, Taylor is credited with
transforming St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Peekskill from a
troubled congregation into a vibrant one, partly by launching a
variety of social service ministries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely thrilled at the call to come to St. Mark's and
working with the congregation in further developing their vision
for ministry, and in building the strength of the parish,'' Taylor
said Thursday by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   He said he looked forward to ``engaging in the issues of the
city and working more closely with Christians around the world. I
really delight in those prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   The Very Rev. Gerald Porter, provost for the Episcopal Diocese
of Olympia and interim priest at St. Mark's, said Taylor's sexual
orientation was ``not a factor'' in his selection and that he was
chosen for his leadership qualities.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue stands out, not the least because Taylor will be
head of the 1,800-member cathedral, the largest Episcopal
congregation in Western Washington and the church where the bishop
makes his headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor declined to comment further about his appointment. He
will attend Sunday services at St. Mark's, an activist congregation
on Seattle's Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Since Taylor arrived at his Peeksville post in 1989, membership
has risen from about 70 to 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were floundering, dwindling,'' said Betty Ashton, an office
volunteer at St. Peter's. ``Father Taylor has the energy we needed.
He gave us the spark.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Taylor's leadership, St. Peter's opened an outreach center
that provides day-care service and ministers to the elderly and
those with HIV/AIDS. The church also has a children's outreach
choir made up of both St. Peter's members and citizens of
Peekskill, a middle-class city of 21,000 residents 45 miles north
of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for someone who can be an articulate
spokesperson for the church and the greater community,'' Porter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who's a good preacher. Someone who's a bridge-builder
to work with (Bishop Vincent Warner) and other diocesan leaders.
Someone who has a passion for social justice, who understands the
Gospel in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner was on vacation Thursday and was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has visited St. Mark's three times, the last time two
weeks ago when he and his partner were introduced and warmly
received.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipated hearing (some complaints about Taylor's sexual
orientation) from the congregation,'' St. Mark's spokesman Jeff
Wilson said. ``It was the exact opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor will replace the Very Rev. Frederick Northup, who
resigned in May 1998 to move to Atlanta, where his wife, an
attorney, had accepted a job.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1994, Northup offered to bless the commitment of two
gay men despite Warner's request that the ceremony not proceed. The
couple called off the ceremony but later were united in a ``vow of
commitment'' ceremony. Though not liturgical and thereby official,
the local church considered the ceremony to be part of the pastoral
duties of a priest and therefore allowable.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal Canon states that sexual orientation can't be a
barrier to ordination. At the denomination's last general
convention in 1997, a resolution that would have authorized the
development of a liturgy that would bless same-sex relationships
was narrowly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, under the structure of the ``very inclusive, very broad''
denomination, ``a lot of latitude is given to a diocese on what
they want to do,'' Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a priest who is gay is ``no surprise,'' given the
broad community that St. Mark's serves and the prevalence of gay
clergy within the denomination, said a priest of another Episcopal
church in the diocese.
</P>
<P>
   The priest, who opposes the ordination of gay priests, did not
want his name published. His church, like others in the diocese,
has gone through intense discussion on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who have stayed in the Episcopal Church after all
this stuff, this one thing is not going to push them over the edge.
Because they've already been pushed _ way pushed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a statement adopted by the general convention of the
diocese ``honored'' committed relationships between homosexual
partners.
</P>
<P>
   But not all priests agree. Last year, a letter signed by 33
diocesan priests strongly objected to that statement. While
resolving to ``oppose bigotry in all its forms,'' the clergy said,
the statement ``implies a theology we cannot support.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was chosen by a search committee that included
non-Episcopalians, including the Rev. Tom Quigley, executive
director of the Church Council of Greater Seattle, an ecumenical
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The committee was broad because St. Mark's sees its mission as
serving ``not just the parish but the diocese and the community at
large,'' Porter said. ``We're a prophetic voice on the hill. ...
We're really concerned about issues affecting the wider
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said Taylor was viewed by political and business leaders
in Peekskill as ``a key spokesperson for the religious community.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor will be a good fit for St. Mark's because the cathedral
``really values the role it plays in Seattle,'' Quigley said.
``They like to be on the cutting edge. They really want to mean
something. They want to stand for the right things, the right
quality of life.''

MARK SIDRAN IS SEATTLE'S POINT MAN IN CREATING CIVIL CLIMATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELAINE PORTERFIELD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the struggle for the hearts, minds and good manners
of Seattle, Mark Sidran is more than willing to wage war.
</P>
<P>
   Sidran, the three-term Seattle city attorney, is the city's
point man in creating a civil climate, from stopping people from
lying on downtown sidewalks to trying to cork noisy nightclubs to
stopping panhandlers from intimidating those with change in their
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   He's also championed a controversial city ordinance that allows
police to impound cars driven by people with suspended licenses,
and has enforced a law banning posters on utility poles.
</P>
<P>
   ``These laws are important in keeping the streets safe,'' says
the 48-year-old attorney. ``You have less crime and less
victimization when they are enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   For those views, he has been reviled as a Nazi, a prig and
someone out to make Seattle safe for the equally reviled yuppies of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see these (laws) as more hostility for people who
traditionally lived in Seattle _ working-class people,'' said
activist Matt Fox, who opposes Sidran's enforcement of a city
ordinance banning posters from utility poles. ``These laws
needlessly expand the power of government and are disrespectful of
individual rights and liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidran, with his receding hairline, plastic-rimmed glasses and
regulation working stiff's blue-shirt-and-tie, hardly looks the
type to disrespect anyone. A classic Everyman at first glance, he's
the block-watch captain down the street, the policy wonk who revels
in sociological studies, the lawyer who loves arguing a case.
</P>
<P>
   And, he says, he's a scapegoat for those who accuse him of
insensitivity to the poor or of being a totalitarian in a sensibly
priced suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to be compassionate,'' Sidran said. ``But these
issues are complicated. Most people will not choose to be in an
environment that makes them feel unsafe or threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, Sidran is fighting for his vision of Seattle's
soul, pushing for a civilized, law-abiding city, with safe, clean
streets and thriving businesses and neighborhoods where drunks
don't frighten kids in the park.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents _ and they are many _ yearn for the grittier
working town of yesterday, the Seattle that spawned Skid Road and
values a beer in a city park or a garage band's flier on a utility
pole.
</P>
<P>
   A sometime opponent, City Councilman Nick Licata, says he
realizes many middle class residents of Seattle find Sidran's ideas
seductive. But he warns they could drain the vitality from the city
if they aren't carefully monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can very quickly become a stagnant city,'' Licata said.
``This could also become a very oppressive city ... there is a
balance that has to be obtained.''
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances can fester
</P>
<P>
   Mark Sidran's view of life in the city can be found in ``Fixing
Broken Windows,'' a 1996 book by George Kelling and Catherine
Coles. The authors write that small annoyances in an urban setting
can fester and become big problems: Graffiti and litter create the
impression that lawlessness is tolerated, which leads to increased
street crime.
</P>
<P>
   Then businesses fail as customers become increasingly fearful of
patronizing neighborhoods they perceive as unsafe. Whole
neighborhoods can fall into blight and decay, a world in which
petty thieves, public drunks and drug dealers have the upper hand
on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to fight that downward spiral, say proponents of
the Broken Windows school, is to prevent it from starting. Employed
in New York City, proponents credit it with rescuing streets and
subways from increasing chaos and fear, leading to a per-capita
murder rate that's now lower than that of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Results like this made him embrace the philosophy, Sidran said,
and to use it to help Seattle master its problems. He's spoken and
written widely on the ideas in ``Fixing Broken Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a percentage of the book sales,'' Sidran likes to joke.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, they are ideas that need to be seriously considered
at all levels, he says, because they benefit all residents, from
the well-off to the those who live on the streets who are most
likely to be the victims of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone needs standards in their life in terms of their own
self-dignity,'' he says, ``even late-stage alcoholics.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a view that profoundly disturbs some civic leaders and
advocates for the homeless, and Sidran's promotion of civility has
touched off a surprisingly vehement debate in a city where nearly
all elected officials pride themselves on being part of a long
tradition of cooperation and progressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``His emphasis is maybe more on social order,'' said Councilman
Peter Steinbrueck, another Seattle native. ``I'm concerned about
efforts to clean everything up ... Seattle is becoming increasingly
more intolerant. The civility laws I think are to appease and
increase the comfort of the well-to-do and the well-heeled.''
</P>
<P>
   Former City Councilman and council candidate Charlie Chong says
he opposes everything about Sidran's philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's puritanical,'' Chong said. ``It's what somebody else
decides is civil, and it's not necessarily my view.''
</P>
<P>
   But that said, Sidran is only suggesting and enforcing laws
approved by a majority of council members, Chong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The council is just as guilty as Mr. Sidran _ more guilty,
because they voted for them,'' Chong said.
</P>
<P>
   Views like that anger Chris Martin, a Sidran supporter whose
company, CityScapes, specializes in graffiti removal and litter
control in Pioneer Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not whether you're homeless, it's if your
behavior is unacceptable,'' Martin said. ``Our problem is with
people who are drinking, smashing bottles and defecating in the
parks ... I think the majority of Seattle citizens are fed up with
this kind of behavior on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidran says he senses support from many Seattle citizens _ ``I
hesitate to call them the silent majority'' _ including the poor
who cannot flee to expensive suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe there is a broad middle ground,'' he said,
attributing the high high-profile criticism he's drawn in part to
the polarizing politics of his opponents. He recalls that one group
representing the homeless publicly crushed his effigy under an
outhouse after he pointed out problems associated with opening
public toilets on downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes great political theater,'' he said, but does little
to advance a solution to deal with the problem. ``It's an
idealogue's view of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   John Fox, coordinator of the Housing Displacement Coalition,
which advocates for the homeless, relishes attacking Sidran and
enforcement of the civility laws, laws he believes are specifically
targeted at the homeless, the poor and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He represents a community view that in my mind is dangerous,''
said Fox, who is not related to Matt Fox. ``His policies drive a
wedge through the community, alienating and creating divisions.
That's clearly the effect of his policies and he knows that, but I
honestly believe he doesn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidran says his critics couldn't be more mistaken about his
capacity to care.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a pharmacist from Seward Park, Sidran went east to
Harvard for college, but returned to his beloved hometown to study
the law. He notes that his path in life was outlined in his college
admission essays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote my college applications on my interest in urban policy
and politics and how in my own view, Seattle would confront many of
the issues other cities were then wrestling with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, Sidran is still wrestling, and his stake in the
city is bigger than ever. Last year, he and his wife, Anais Winant,
took out a mortgage to purchase the Smith Block Building at 1923
First Avenue, just north of the Pike Place Market, for $1.5
million. Once dominated by a theater that showed XXX-rated movies,
the three-story building has been remodeled and now houses a
bed-and-breakfast, residential units and a salon.
</P>
<P>
   The scars of battle
</P>
<P>
   Re-elected to the $105,000-a-year job without opposition in
1997, Sidran is in his third four-year term as City Attorney.
Though willing to continue the war for the soul of the city, he
does show scars of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `You're so prosecutor-focused,' and I say, `Yeah,
right,'' he said, irritated. ``I have written (editorial) pieces
for years saying I don't think the answers to these complicated
issues is simply more law enforcement. You also have to deal with a
lack of treatment beds. We also have a lot of late-stage alcoholics
killing themselves, and we have the state licensing stores to sell
(alcohol) to them. We have to look at the complexity of these
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidran says he really doesn't mind most of the things his
opponents say about him _ with one exception: being branded a Nazi.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, it bothers me because I'm a Jew,'' he said. ``Second,
it's a cheap shot. There are people alive who lived through (the
Holocaust), who survived it. I find it unbelievably insensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not yet clear if Sidran has the ability to carry that brand
of problem-solving to higher office _ or even if he wants to. He's
mum about his plans, although he didn't say `no' when asked if he
would run for King County prosecutor should longtime Prosecutor
Norm Maleng retire.
</P>
<P>
   His stands on posters and nightclubs may have alienated young
voters _ the kind who volunteer for campaigns. But he may also
attract supporters for his consistent stands.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Sidran is unlikely to change his ways any time
soon. In his view, the stakes are too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is better off in a city that works,'' he said. ``It
is possible for cities to die.''

ANGELS TRADE PAIR TO A'S
</HEADLINE>

 &UR;
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels made a trade Thursday
night, but it wasn't the deal that has been anticipated for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Chuck Finley is still an Angel _ for now. Instead, the
Angels sent second baseman Randy Velarde and starting pitcher Omar
Olivares to the Oakland A's for three minor-leaguers. The Angels
got pitcher Elvin Nina and outfielders Jeff DaVanon and Nathan
Haynes in exchange for their most consistent player and pitcher
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde is hitting .306 with nine homers and 48 RBI, and
Olivares is 8-9 with a 4.05 ERA in 20 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Sending Velarde seems to be a sign the Angels are about to trade
Finley to the Indians because one of the players the Angels would
like in return is speedy second baseman Enrique Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Both Velarde and Olivares are free agents at the end of this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Nina, a right-hander from the Dominican Republic, was a
17th-round pick of the A's in 1997. DaVanon was a 26th-round pick
of the A's in 1995, and Haynes was chosen the first round of the
supplemental draft in '97. &QL;

SEEKING MORE PRIVACY, HASEK ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best running back in professional football retired this week
citing disinterest in the game. Not wanting to play for his current
employer might also have played a part in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the best goaltender in professional hockey announced
he will call it quits after the 1999-2000 season for a far more
personal reason: his family and their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Weary of constant media scrutiny and trapped by the celebrity of
a sports superstar in America, Dominik Hasek said he will abandon
the Buffalo Sabres and his contract after next season and return to
his native Czech Republic, family in tow, where they might again
lead something approaching a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek's departure comes in a dramatically different manner than
that of NFL great Barry Sanders, who stunned the sports world when
word got out Tuesday night that he was suddenly quitting the
Detroit Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to retire because of two reasons, my kids (and) too
much public and media attention,'' said Hasek, a two-time NHL most
valuable player who last spring led the Sabres into the Stanley Cup
Finals, where they lost a six-game series to the Stars on a
controversial overtime goal in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek said during the playoffs that he was tired of the media
attention and the fan following he has received since emerging as
the league's top goaltender following his acquisition from the
Chicago Blackhawks in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   His celebrity status soared after he led the Czech Republic to
the gold medal with a brilliant performance during the 1998 Winter
Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview prior to the Stanley Cup Finals, Hasek said
he longed to live a quieter, more private life where neither he nor
his family, including his two young children, would receive so much
attention from media or fans. He said the attention had become too
much, both in Buffalo and in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Hasek reiterated those sentiments while saying he was
99 percent sure he would never play hockey again after the
1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his unquestioned prowess between the pipes, Hasek has
been roundly flayed in the media in recent seasons for deciding not
to play through injuries. During the 1999 Eastern Conference finals
against Toronto, he flew to the Czech Republic to have a strained
groin checked out and missed two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy to play the game and I enjoy to be with my teammates.
It's part of my job to talk to the media,'' Hasek said. ``It is
something I don't really enjoy. It's not fun for me.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the fan frenzy that has followed him on both sides of the
Atlantic, Hasek said, ``The attention I've received is
overwhelming. It's something I don't enjoy at all. It's time to
step back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek also said he wasn't comfortable with having his 9-year-old
son, Michael, and 4-year-old daughter, Dominika, spending most of
the year living in the United States. Hasek said he and his wife,
Alena, want their children to spend more time in the family's
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our kids to go back to Czech Republic and share in our
families' backgrounds and culture,'' Hasek said. ``Every year, it's
more and more difficult, especially for my son, to adapt to the
Czech life. Every year, he has more problems to speak Czech.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek dismissed suggestions that he might, as other star
athletes have, be simply trying to increase his $7 million-a-year
salary, second among NHL goalies only to Patrick Roy, who makes
$7.5 million annually with the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, 34, has two years remaining on his contract and would
forgo $7.5 million in 2000-01 as well as a club option for $9
million in 2001-02 by retiring.
</P>
<P>
   However, money, he said, ``was not an issue at all. I have
enough money to live a nice life, not only for me but my kids and
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   More of an issue, he said, was, ``I miss the game and I miss my
friends, my teammates in the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek said he most enjoys having his teammates skate up to him
in his net after a win, followed by the skate back to the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the game the way I did three, four, five years ago,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``I made a decision: it's over. I hate to say
never. (But) I am 99 percent I will never come back to hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek defended the timing of his announcement, which, it was
suggested, could be a distraction to the Sabres as they seek to
follow up their surprisingly successful 1998-99 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it was the best time to do it,'' he said. ``I really
don't know what is the better time. Closer to training camp is not
good. ''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek has had several nagging injuries in recent years, but said
his decision was not affected by them.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he has not discussed the possibility of a trade
with Sabres management, nor has he considered it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to finish my career in Buffalo, and I think I will,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo assistant general manager Larry Carriere said the timing
of Hasek's announcement actually helped the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave us the opportunity to plan ... our future a year in
advance,'' Carriere said.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement, Hasek plans to spend more time with his family
and concentrate on his clothing line, which is available in the
Czech Republic and, Hasek said, could soon be available in the
United States and Canada as well.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the line: ``The Dominator.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hasek, ``I need to compete in something. It's something I
feel I can compete in.'' nn

MAN SURPRISE WINNER OF LOOK-ALIKE CONTEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DONNA HUFFAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sporting pigtails and above-the-knee nylons, the
winner of the Britney Spears look-alike contest was twice as old as
most of the other contestants and seven years older than the
17-year-old sensation herself.
</P>
<P>
   But more remarkable than that _ Robert Stephens is a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to die,'' he exclaimed Thursday at the thought of
standing side by side with his favorite diva.
</P>
<P>
   As Stephens was handed his prize _ tickets to the singer's
sold-out Saturday concert at Universal Amphitheater where he will
also get to meet Spears backstage _ the 24-year-old drag queen
shrieked through thunderous applause from the lunchtime spectators,
many of whom thought he was a she.
</P>
<P>
   Although the contest, part of the Sprint PCS Summer Splash
Spears Style, was not limited by age or gender, the majority of
would-be Britneys ranged from 11 to 14 years old and were decidedly
lacking in Y chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their losses, the girls took it all in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's show biz,'' shrugged 11-year-old Rachel Snow of La
Crescenta.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel, a radiant redhead, said she wasn't intimidated at all by
the growing crowd as she mouthed the words to her favorite singer's
song and danced back and forth across the stage. She graciously
accepted her consolation prize, a Sprint PCS hat.
</P>
<P>
   Set in front of a Sprint PCS store at the corner of California
Avenue and Brand Boulevard, the competition featured more than 30
contestants, some performing in groups that counted as one entrant.
Each Britney hopeful danced and lip-synced to songs from the pop
star's CD, spun by a disc jockey from KIIS-FM (102.7).
</P>
<P>
   Solo on the stage during her rendition of ``Baby One More
Time,'' 11-year-old Katrina Dariell braided her hair, made up her
face and borrowed her friend's Catholic school uniform skirt. The
second-place winner mouthed ``good job'' to Stephens as he received
tickets and roses, and Katrina won a backpack.
</P>
<P>
   Katrina had hoped to demonstrate her vocal as well as dancing
skills during the contest but was allowed only to mouth the words
like the other performers. Disappointed because she wanted tickets
``really, really, really, really bad,'' Katrina will keep listening
to the radio for free tickets to Saturday's concert at Universal
Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
   Rocking their own hips in rhythmic synchronicity, Stephens and
his two backup dancers will split the tickets and limousine ride to
the show, he said. Dancer Nakia Sisowath said he is more excited
about watching the choreography than its teen-age star.
</P>
<P>
   Not Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my favorite. She's the total reigning teen diva,''
Stephens said, adding he will don anew the miniskirt, nylons, fuzzy
hair scrunchies, pigtails and platform shoes when he shakes his
idol's hand this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The all-male trio, who work as dancers at Disneyland,
acknowledged a pang of guilt for disappointing girls half their
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they'll get over it,'' said Le Derek Rocque, 21.

ANGELS DEAL PAIR TO A'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels made a trade Thursday
night, but it wasn't the deal that has been anticipated for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Chuck Finley is still an Angel _ for now. Instead, the
Angels sent second baseman Randy Velarde and starting pitcher Omar
Olivares to the Oakland A's for three minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got pitcher Elvin Nina, 23, and outfielders Jeff
DaVanon, 25, and Nathan Haynes, 20, in exchange for their most
consistent player and pitcher this season. Velarde is hitting .306
with nine homers and 48 RBI, and Olivares is 8-9 with a 4.05 ERA in
20 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what it is,'' Angels general manager Bill Bavasi said of
the trade. ``These are two good veterans going to a club that has a
chance at the wild card and we're trying to retool for the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Sending Velarde might be a sign the Angels are about to trade
Finley to the Indians because one of the players the Angels would
like in return is speedy second baseman Enrique Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi said this trade ``may be our last deal or there may be
others.'' He would not speculate on Finley's situation.
</P>
<P>
   Both Velarde and Olivares are free agents at the end of this
season, and it shows the Angels didn't expect to bring back either
one next season despite what they've done this year.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde is 36 but might be the club's MVP this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we thought about that, but sometimes you have to
weigh the odds,'' Bavasi said. ``What are the odds of bringing him
back at the dollar figure you feel is right?''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares leads all the starters on the staff in wins and has
thrown the club's only two complete games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a breakthrough year for him,'' Bavasi said.
``He's always been a guy that might've been cursed by his ability
to go from the bullpen to the rotation and back to the bullpen. For
him, I'm sure he hated that. He wanted to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi said he doesn't expect the trade to go over well in the
Angels clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are very popular guys,'' he said. ``I would guess there
will be some discussion to the negative, but that's only natural. I
think players probably view that as an insult to the players who
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina, a right-hander from the Dominican Republic, was a
17th-round pick of the A's in 1997. DaVanon was a 26th-round pick
of the A's in 1995, and Haynes was chosen in the first round of the
supplemental draft in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes, whose speed was important to the Angels, will report to
Single-A Lake Elsinore and Nina and DaVanon will report to Double-A
Erie.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Sheets will be called up to play second base for now, but
Bavasi said he did not know who would replace Olivares in the
starting rotation.

I was more limber, I'd kick myself in the butt for not thinking of
it first.
<P>
   So would the Board of Supervisors, which is kicking butts by
requiring owners to place ashtrays in front of their bars, stores
and offices, for sidewalk smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The butt drifts on sidewalks are unsightly, but do we need a
million ashtrays which will need to be dumped, maintained,
monitored and policed?
</P>
<P>
   How many enforcement officers will this require? How many tons
of sand?
</P>
<P>
   If you have your dog in a store and the dog indicates it needs
to heed nature's call in the worst way, and you take Rover outside
to the curb, do you leave the residue for the shopkeeper to clean
up? Do you tell Mabel Teng we need sidewalk poop-deposit boxes?
</P>
<P>
   Let's say the answers are no. So if you're in a store, shop or
bar and you need a smoke and you step outside, why is the bar owner
responsible for providing a means of disposal for your mess?
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution to the butt problem is simple,'' says Peter
William Brown. ``What do you think God intended us to do with all
those empty Altoids containers?''
</P>
<P>
   Make this the law, Supes: Smokers must stick their butts where
the sun don't shine _ in a little tin box, kept in pocket or purse.
</P>
<P>
   You smokers, the public is going to pick up the tab for your
cancer treatments, we shouldn't have to buy you ashtrays, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's called individual responsibility: You puff it, you stuff
it.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU`RE going to go Code Blue on us and want to live to tell
about it, have your heart attack at the Bay Club on Battery, which
is connected to the Synapse Medical Group.
</P>
<P>
   At lunchtime Wednesday, a man went into full cardiac arrest at
the club while playing basketball, and within 20 seconds Dr. Ryan
Honda had scooted over from his office and was giving
mouth-to-mouth, a first for both parties.
</P>
<P>
   The man wasn't breathing and had no heartbeat, but Honda's CPR
kept blood flowing to the brain for the three or four minutes until
paramedics arrived with the de-fib paddles, shock you very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awake, doing well and he's very happy to be alive,'' Doc
Honda reported Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But how did the guy's team do?
</P>
<P>
   UNFORGETTABLE, that was the experience of songbird Natalie Cole
when her bus hit a snag at the new, improved SFO.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie was in the Bay Area for some performances and to visit
with her old buddy Judi Basolo. When it was time to fly out, Cole
jumped on her tour bus for a drop-off at SFO.
</P>
<P>
   Oops! The bus was too tall for the new entrance to the departure
drop-off area at the United terminal. This bus has been all over
the country and never before been too tall.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's manager flagged down a passing van, which gave the star a
lift to the departures curb.
</P>
<P>
   Only in San Francisco: Natalie Cole, hitchhiking.
</P>
<P>
   ``JUST SAW a hooker,'' reports Edwin Heaven, ``she was standing
in front of one of those new Shell billboards that read, `I'd like
to pay, pump and bolt.' Of course, I drove right by, not being in
the mood to shell it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Or not wanting to part with 50 clams.

ALEUTIAN GOOSE MAKES A COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A goose that was on the brink of extinction 25 years ago has
rebounded so vigorously that federal officials will announce their
intention Friday to remove it from their list of endangered and
threatened wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   When it was listed as endangered shortly after the passage of
the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1972, the number of Aleutian
geese was under 400.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are more than 30,000 of the birds, which are one of
11 subspecies of Canada goose _ distinctive waterfowl that have
gray and buff bodies, long black necks and black heads with white
cheek patches.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists credit their recovery to a vigorous predator control
program on the remote Alaskan islands where they breed, and tough
protections throughout their winter migration routes in Washington,
Oregon and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really helped was the elimination of arctic foxes on
their (western Aleutian) breeding islands,'' said Dennis
Woolington, the supervisory wildlife biologist for the San Luis
National Wildlife Refuge near Los Banos.
</P>
<P>
   The foxes had been brought to the islands by fur farmers and
trappers, ultimately devastating the local birds _ including
Aleutian geese.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the Canada goose subspecies are good at pioneering new
breeding grounds, or moving back into a breeding area that they've
been eliminated from,'' said Woolington.
</P>
<P>
   ``So as we cleared the islands of foxes, we moved captive
goslings in. They fledged and migrated, then flew back to breed at
the places where we had relocated them. Over the years, we've been
able to build up the populations.''
</P>
<P>
   The birds have also had help in their wintering grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Fully 99 percent of the small, retiring geese spend the winter
at wildlife refuges in the San Joaquin Valley, particularly the San
Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge west of Modesto.
</P>
<P>
   Since their listing, a complex set of hunting regulations and
closures has been in effect along the migratory routes the geese
take.
</P>
<P>
   Woolington said the outright ban on shooting Aleutian geese will
be lifted if the birds are delisted, but that some hunting closures
are likely to remain in effect to provide a continued degree of
protection.
</P>
<P>
   A 90-day public comment period will follow the delisting
proposal, with a final decision by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service expected next year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials consider the delisting proposal
proof that the Endangered Species Act is working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans nearly drove the Aleutian Canada goose to extinction,
and humans through the Endangered Species Act saved this
magnificent bird,'' Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal comes four weeks after the bald eagle was proposed
for delisting. Twenty-seven species have been delisted since
passage of the act _ 16 because they went extinct, or had been
originally listed by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 1,181 animals and plants are currently listed under
the act. &QL;

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: How Warsaw's young warriors view
NATO
 &HT;    (Eds: Corrects fourth-to-last quote: It is sad that it ever took
place ...)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (Eds: Second in a series. Cox News Service columnist Joe Murray
reported from Eastern Europe during a visit 10 years ago, just
before the fall of the Berlin Wall. This summer he returned to
write about the changes that have led three former Eastern Bloc
countries _ Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland _ to become the
newest members of NATO. At the end of the series, CoxNet will
compile these columns into our weekly Focus page, good for running
as a Perspective-type page or op-ed feature. These pages are

   WARSAW _ Other than its history, there's nothing old about Old
Town.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of Warsaw, this segment of the city -- dating back to
the 13th century -- was bombed to basement level, and then some,
before World War II was over and done with.
</P>
<P>
   Old Town has since been reconstructed according to 18th century
architecture. Never mind that New Town is only slightly younger.
The tourists like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   Old Town, too, is where you find the young people, a fine place
for music and beer on warm summer evenings. So it was that I was
here in search of our newest NATO allies, Warsaw's young warriors,
Poland's finest, prepared as they were to lay down their lives for
the NATO way of life.
</P>
<P>
   I had some trouble getting them to set down their beer long
enough to talk. But here are comments I recorded through the help
of an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a scientific poll. If nothing else, it may reflect
a sense of history:
</P>
<P>
   Tomasz Stawinski, high school student, age 17:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good step for Poland to become a NATO member. Many
politicians, deciding to make that step, perhaps thought first
about their own career, not about the whole nation. But from the
point of view of the ordinary people, it is good to receive support
from the rest of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Micha Wilczek, student, age 24:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good that Poland is in NATO. We never knew before whose
side we were on. It was as if we were between a hammer and an
anvil. In our feelings, we were always on the side of Western
democracy, but we were bound to the East. We couldn't help that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirek Mordak, student, age 21:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure it will be better for Poland than it used to be. But
Poland has no business in Kosovo. It is an American problem, not
ours. I would like to join the army, but I would not go to Kosovo.
If I had a choice to kill or not to kill someone, I would choose
not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariola and Katarzyna Dbrowska, sisters who work and attend
school part time, ages 19 and 22:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better now. Poland will be safer now. We'll have a
chance to develop. We will be safer from aggression of our Eastern
neighbors. Intervention in Kosovo was necessary. We had to put an
end to people killing other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Katarzyna Majka, student, age 22:
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a NATO member is a protection of our safety. It gives us
a feeling that we belong to this world and that we mean something
for it. The bombing of Kosovo was not necessary and it is sad that
it ever took place.''
</P>
<P>
   Lidka (no last name given), nurse, age 29:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to take much more for us to become a real NATO
member. We should solve our inner problems first before becoming a
NATO member. We cannot solve our ordinary problems of education,
health care and agriculture. We are too weak to handle all the
responsibilities of NATO membership. The invasion of Kosovo was a
very big mistake made by an irresponsible person.''
</P>
<P>
   Edyta Wacierak, student, age 21:
</P>
<P>
   ``The invasion of Kosovo was a game played at the top by
politicians, between the U.S. and Russia. Those countries gained
profits from it. It's not about people's problems, but about
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Pawe Lang, student, age 21:
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is a good thing to stabilize our country, but on the
other hand it can spoil our relations with our Eastern neighbors.
As for the bombing of Kosovo, I think it was a good thing, but it
lasted too long.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it, the news from Old Town _ in some ways, not so
different from what you'd hear in a cafe back home, except for that
polka music.
</P>

 &HT;    LORD MAYOR OF LONDON TO VISIT SOUTHEASTERN U.S. FINANCIAL
CENTERS
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Aug. 1 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Seeking better ties between the British capital's
financial community and the booming American Southeast, the lord
mayor of London will travel to Atlanta this week(8/5-6) to meet
with business and political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Levene, also the lord of Portsoken, said last week(CQ)
that it is essential for London to reach out beyond the familiar
turf of New York City if it is to retain its position as one of the
world's foremost international financial center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe the United States begins and ends in
Manhattan,'' said Levene during an interview at the official
mayoral residence, Mansion House. ``We regard the (U.S.) Southeast
with Atlanta at the center of it as being enormously powerful and
very important. If you took the Southeast of the United States and
just ring fenced it, that in itself would probably be one of the
largest most important countries in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Levene intends to stop in Charlotte, N.C., to meet with
NationsBank Chairman Hugh McColl before arriving in Atlanta, where
he will meet with Gov. Roy Barnes. He also will meet with
executives from Wachovia and SunTrust banking companies, Insurance
Commissioner John Oxendine and representatives of the regional
transportation authority.
</P>
<P>
   The lord mayor said his message is simple: ``We want to persuade
banks, companies, financiers -- anyone who's interested in
international trade -- that they should look at London as the first
stop in the international financial world.''
</P>
<P>
   Also chairman of European investment for Deutsche Bank, Levene
is one of the most experienced business and political leaders to
serve in the largely ceremonial post of lord mayor. He was former
British Prime Minister John Major's adviser on efficiency and
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   He is using his high profile to reassure the business world that
London has lost none of its luster even though Britain is the most
conspicuous European player to reject joining the unified currency.
The euro was initiated for banking and other electronic
transactions last January.
</P>
<P>
   Levene said the city's financial center has been affected little
by the Euro. ``The reason is that London is by far the most
important financial center in Europe, and we trade here whatever
financial instrument is trading, be it euros or dollars or yen or
anything else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with the lord mayor will be Max Taylor, the chairman
of Lloyd's of London; and Tim Carroll, the chairman of the
International Underwriters Association of London.
</P>
<P>
   After his business trip, which also includes stops in Miami and
San Francisco, Levene said he will vacation at his home on Sea
Island, where he has been a part-time resident for 14 years. ``I
have quite strong ties with Georgia because we also have a home
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Levene is the last of his ancient line of lord mayors to hold
the post without the presence of an elected mayor, who will preside
over the city of 7.2 million beginning next year. London has never
before had a directly elected mayor or the level of autonomy
contemplated in its proposed new government.
</P>
<P>
   The election, a source of considerable political friction here,
will be held next May. Among the candidates is Jeffrey Archer, the
blockbuster novelist and member of the House of Lords.

 &HT;    ISRAELI BEDOUIN HOPE NEW GOVERNMENT LIFTS THEM FROM LIMBO AND
POVERTY
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of a locator map, Um Bateen is about 5 miles
northeast of Beersheva in the northern Negev desert.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Aug. 1 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UM BATEEN, Israel _ The Bedouin in the Abu Kaf family raise
camels and goats, grow their own food and value the
self-sufficiency they have on their desert hillside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are satisfied with our lives. We just want to stay on our
land,'' said 52-year-old Talal Abu Kaf, seated on carpets on the
land where his family has lived for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,500 Bedouin live in here in Um Bateen, where the water
arrives in black tubes that snake from house to house and
barefooted children fly kites fashioned from scraps of trash.
</P>
<P>
   But, as far as the Israeli government is concerned, Um Bateen
barely exists. The village is one of about 45 Bedouin settlements
in the Negev Desert that remains unrecognized by the government and
therefore denied its own local government or services such as
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bedouin leaders hope Israel's month-old government will
give the 70,000 villagers in unrecognized settlements equal status
with their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   They back a $123-million plan to recognize 16 additional
villages in Negev and upgrade the medical, educational and utility
services for them and others.
</P>
<P>
   Parliamentary candidates in the spring elections gave tentative
backing to the plan, but it is too early to tell if they will
implement it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every election they come here. After the election, everything
vanishes,'' said Alasam Atiah, chairman of the Regional Council for
the Unrecognized Negev Arab Villages. ``Now, we have some
connections, so maybe we can do something.''
</P>
<P>
   A key backer of the improvement plan was Labor Party
parliamentarian Yossi Beilin. More than 90 percent of the Bedouin
voted for Labor's Ehud Barak in his election as prime minister, but
Beilin's personal endorsement expressly did not bind his party to
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``How fast we can deal with it, I cannot tell you,'' said Amir
Avramovitch, Beilin's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Bedouin -- a Muslim Arab sub-group -- have long had
trouble fitting in with the modern Jewish state. For generations,
they roamed the Negev and Sinai deserts, traveling the feeding
routes of their camels and goats while authorities of the old
Ottoman Empire or British Colonial rule cared little about their
arid land.
</P>
<P>
   But, since they took over in 1948, Israeli authorities have
actively settled and industrialized the Negev. The desert's
development has been important as it comprises more than half of
Israel, a country about the size of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bedouin need government permits to travel the routes of
their livestock and most have abandoned their nomadic ways. Many
rely on farming or, if they are not among the 50 percent of Bedouin
unemployed, they work in Israel's cities. Hundreds serve in the
Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has taken most Bedouin land and knocked down their tents
and block homes. Technically, 16,000 Bedouin homes in the
unrecognized settlements are under threat of demolition. The
authorities usually just target occasional new structures, but that
has lead to near riots.
</P>
<P>
   The Bedouin say the government has taken 98 percent of their
land, sometimes offering paltry compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Their hold on the land is often more traditional than legal.
Clinton Bailey, who has studied them for more than 30 years, said
the Bedouin often fail to register their land because they crave
privacy and fear government taxation. Often, the land was not in
demand, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions for the Bedouin lag far behind the rest of Israel.
According to a study by an Israeli think tank, the Negev Bedouin
infant mortality rate is 19 per 1,000 compared to just four per
1,000 for Jewish infants. Half the families live below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Israel recognizes seven out of 52 Negev Bedouin
cities and only two of those are allowed Bedouin leadership. The
government gives them services in hopes other Bedouin will move
there rather than stay spread out where, the government maintains,
it is too hard to provide services.
</P>
<P>
   For moving to the recognized villages, the Bedouin can receive
modest subsidies, such as an acre of land and a few thousand
dollars. But, the recognized towns have high unemployment and
frequent disputes between families over their small plots of land.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Bedouin fear that the city life means forfeiting their
land, privacy and tent compounds, and exposing their traditions --
such as polygamy -- to possible extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, unrecognized villages such as Um Bateen struggle with
a lack electricity, steady water supplies, high schools and
adequate health care centers. The Association for Civil Rights in
Israel, the country's largest independent civil rights group,
called last month(July) for better health care for the Negev
Bedouin.
</P>
<P>
   Moti Zaken, adviser to the Israeli government on Arab affairs,
noted that the government recently started a five-year, $154
million plan to improve services for 50,000 Bedouin in northern
Israel. He said it is time to take care of the Negev, but the
Bedouin there are more dispersed and more attached to traditional
land claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more complicated,'' he said. ``It's confronting the
Old World with the New World.''

 &HT;    Isle of Skye full of beautiful landscape and heavenly visions
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLE OF SKYE, Scotland _ Within minutes of crossing the bridge
from the Scottish mainland, my wife, Cathy, and I left more than
our earthly cares behind. We left Earth. Crossing a ridge in our
rental car in early evening, plunging through wisps of cloud into a
vast V-shaped ravine toward a pewter-colored loch, we arrived on
Planet Skye.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the occasional cottage of whitewashed stone, not a
human habitation could be seen. Thus the ubiquitous sheep _ peering
down from rocky crags, scratching their sides against fenceposts _
seemed like friendly aliens, welcoming us to their ruggedly
beautiful world. The treeless landscape was carpeted with
grayish-green briar and pale purple heather. Waterfalls, flush with
frequent rains, glinted with silvery brightness against the dark
slopes. Mountains _ some surreally topped by patches of June snow _
loomed ahead, and more mountains hunkered dimly in the mist behind
them, like the ghosts of their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Mist is a leitmotif of Skye _ called Eilean o Cheo (Island of
Mist) in Gaelic _ whose turbulent and bloody history is now stilled
in ancient standing stones, the ruins of medieval castles and Iron
Age forts. The island's name comes from skuy, the word for cloud
among the Norsemen who raided these western Scottish shores in the
Middle Ages. But we decided, after a two-day exploration of the
northern half of the 50-mile-long island (which ranges from seven
to 25 miles wide), that Skye simply means sky. Some of the island's
greatest glories are overhead. Light puts on a constant, awesome
show, refracted through tumbling mists or breaking through clouds
to form searchlight beams that sweep across the hillsides. In the
words of Kate Porteus, proprietor of the Quiraing Lodge: ``With the
weather changing completely every 20 minutes, we never lack for
entertainment up here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Up here'' means the same latitude as Alaska, so summer
twilights linger past 11 p.m. It was between 8 and 9 p.m. when we
crested a ridge and saw the town of Portree, our destination, in
the distance. Since it had been mostly overcast on our four-hour
drive from Glasgow and we'd assumed the sun was long gone, it was
startling when clouds ahead began glowing reddish and backlighted
the cliffs above the town. There, weirdly silhouetted and poking
out from the cliffs like a colossal gargoyle, is the Old Man of
Storr, a 165-foot column of basalt. It marks the beginning of
amazing rock formations stretching along the northeastern coast
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   We descended into the harbor town as if into a dream.

 &HT;    Slipping into a hiker's paradise
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLE OF SKYE, Scotland _ I spent the better part of a cool,
windy morning trying to get into prison. And The Prison set me
free.
</P>
<P>
   From a precarious perch in this well-named rock formation _ a
maze of spooky natural monoliths suggesting jail bars _ I had an
exhilarating view. Two thousand feet below I could see Staffin Bay,
distant rock islets and green hills where hundred-yard rows of peat
moss strips _ sliced from the turf and flipped over to dry _ looked
like colossal zippers holding the land together.
</P>
<P>
   The Prison is one of the most striking formations in the Quirang
(COO-rang, from the Gaelic), a cluster of eccentric low mountains
on the east coast of Skye's northermost Trotternish Peninsula. As
you drive past The Prison, or wind toward it on the popular hiking
trail that starts on the Uig Road, the rocks offer shifting shapes
and evocations. At twilight, when fog seeps out between the
monoliths, it seems a huge witches' caldron _ a good place, say,
for Macbeth to meet the Weird Sisters. When the light allows a
brief glimpse into The Prison's deep recesses, it becomes the
Minotaur's maze, beckoning to suckers like me.
</P>
<P>
   Impatient to enter the maze, I left the gently rising path to
strike up an almost-vertical funnel-shaped ravine filled with loose
rock, which occasionally dislodged and banged down the mountain for
an unnervingly long time. Looking down, I suddenly realized that
giant boulders in the valley below had obviously tumbled down this
ravine. And I understood why the Trotternish coast is called one of
Europe's largest landslips. It's a place where masses of soft rock
are slumping toward the sea from a 4,000-foot spine of volcanic
basalt _ of which The Prison bars are a skeletal remnant.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling I was about to personally experience landslip, I
nervously gripped the ravine wall and with the other hand gingerly
focused my camera on a looming monolith. Boom: a black cloud
clamped over the sun like an iron lid. As Lee Swedenbourg, a
visitor from San Francisco, told me earlier, ``You can line up the
greatest shots in the world on Skye, but by the time you get the
lens cap off, they're gone.'' Ah, well. I quickly retreated down
the trembly ravine.
</P>
<P>
   The Quiraing is remote even by Skye standards, with few hotels
handy, but there is an exceptional one in the Quiraing Lodge, a
rambling, homey 1850 hunting lodge on the south shore of Staffin
Bay. Innkeeper Kate Porteus' vegetarian dinner and breakfast
(included in the $93.50 charge for a double) are satisfying even to
a dedicated carnivore. In the back yard is a rare and lovely sight:
a freshwater river tumbling steeply into the salt bay.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond is another prime hiking area (Wellingtons are a must, and
Porteus has a pair for every foot!), a secluded headland strewn
with yellow irises and purple thistle. Streams chuckle in hidden
gullies. Cormorants boldly dive for fish in the sea swells.
Standing atop the headland, my wife, Cathy and I got a view that
silenced us for minutes, as we swiveled 360 degrees to take in the
Quiraing, backlit by the evening sun (it was about 9:30 p.m.), and
a rolling plateau of sheep pastures cut off by seaside cliffs.

 &HT;    A violent past, Serene present
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLE OF SKYE, Scotland _ Skye, part of the Inner Hebrides that
arc across the northwest coast of the Scottish Highlands, has bred
a tough, independent, outsider spirit, not unlike American outposts
such as Appalachia and the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   It was here in 1746 that Flora MacDonald fearlessly harbored
Bonnie Prince Charlie, fugitive pretender to the English throne, by
smuggling him over from another island in a rowboat and disguising
him as her Irish maid, ``Betty Burke.'' Skye clans were a law unto
themselves _ specifically, the MacDonalds and the MacLeods, who
feuded bloodily for centuries. Visits from English kings failed to
shake them into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Portree, the island's only substantial town, is derived, some
believe, from the Gaelic Portrigh (Port of the King), commemorating
one of these ineffectual saber-rattling visits by James V in 1540.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed at the Bosville, a delightfully snug
turn-of-the-century hotel with pine-paneled rooms. For dinner we
had local salmon: heaven on a plate. The local ale is classified by
weight, not unlike American motor oil (``70 shilling'' is golden
and medium, ``80 shilling'' is dark and heavy), but tastes much
better. The Scots' typically hearty morning meal (eggs with choice
of kippers, smoked haddock or ham and sausages) is built into the
price of a Bosville room ($150, double). ``After this breakfast,''
a waitress cracked, ``you're set for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Below the hotel, pastel storefronts picturesquely line the quay,
where fishermen load their craft to the cries of wheeling gulls.
Beyond the quay is The Lump, a little fistlike peninsula in the
harbor, topped by a grassy amphitheater where traditional Scottish
games are played on warm evenings. A flagpole marks where public
hangings took place well into the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling among these sights on a quiet, cloudy morning, it's
hard to believe the island was once a violent place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace is so easy here they actually call it Skye Time,''
says Allison Rouse, who was so taken with the isle that she ditched
her career as an Edinburgh lawyer a few years ago to run the
Rosedale Hotel on the quay. ``The newspapers from the mainland
don't arrive until half ten (10:30 a.m.) and nobody cares. It's
wonderful _ like the Spaniards' notion of manana. But when a
repairman says he'll do it Wednesday, it's a good idea to ask,
`Which Wednesday?'''
</P>
<P>
   From hilltop fort to sunken dungeon
</P>
<P>
   After lunch a steady rain (get used to it _ the price you pay
for the lush greenery and all those thrashing streams) sent us into
our car. We were bound on a circuit of the top half of Skye that
would take us south to Sligachan, northwest to Dunvegan Castle and
north around the Trotternish Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest of Sligachan, we spotted the ruins of Dun (or Hill)
Beag, best preserved of the brochs, or stone forts, on the island
that have been dated to a century before or after Christ. They're
believed to have protected livestock from thieves. Dun Beag is
worth the 100-yard climb from the road because there's more to its
roofless ruins than can be seen from below. Kids would have a ball
(within reason, since this is a fragile historic site) exploring
the trenchlike passage between the inner and outer walls and the
little round chambers that bulge out of the outer walls. It's a set
for a tykes' ``Braveheart.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost across the road begins a loop to the secluded Ullinish
Lodge, a handsome 18th-century inn that hosted Samuel Johnson and
James Boswell on the 1773 trip that Boswell recorded as ``Journal
of a Tour of the Hebrides.'' Judging by a quick tour, the rates,
starting at $103 for two, are astoundingly reasonable, especially
with a 2,700-acre back yard for shooting and fishing. There's a
magnificent view of Loch Harport and The Cuillins, famed hiking
mountains of southern Skye. There was no arguing with proprietor
Claudia Mulford: ``If it's ruggedness you want in your sceneries,
we're second to none.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the detailed map in the indispensable booklet ``Touring
the Isle of Skye'' (sold at the Bosville), we spotted two standing
stones, dramatically framed against Loch Snizort Beag, though
they're on private, fenced-off property. Legend says the stones
supported the stew pot for the island's ancient giants, the
Fiennes. (Much larger, judging by the monoliths, than their
namesake actors Ralph and Joseph.)
</P>
<P>
   Attention must be paid to the oldest continually inhabited
residence in Scotland: Dunvegan Castle, perched on Skye's
nothwestern shore, still seat of the MacLeod clan after 720 years.
</P>
<P>
   The stone exterior, evidently added in the early 20th century,
is drab but completely deceptive: The beautifully preserved
interior has weapons, documents, portraits and furnishings
representative of every century since the 16th. A source of
fascination is the Fairy Flag, of which a tattered scrap is
displayed on the wall. Legend says that it was a gift to an early
MacLeod chief from his fairy lover, tenderly placed over his
sleeping child when the nanny slipped out for a nip of celidh
(party) cheer. Whether you buy the notion that the flag gives
magical protection for any fighting MacLeod (soldier sons who
carried photos of it survived World War I) or can charm herring
into the bay, you have to be intrigued that fiber analysis suggests
it was made in medieval Syria. One theory is that it was a banner
for knights in the Crusades.
</P>
<P>
   With all the tasteful exhibits in Dunvegan, it's almost a relief
to peer down into the shadowy dungeon _ the oldest, 13th-century,
part of the castle, a pit scooped from solid rock _ and hear a tape
loop of moans and groans. Amusingly cheesy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prodigious wild prospects''
</P>
<P>
   Heading north and east, we circled the most remote, northwestern
part of the Trotternish Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The ``main'' coastal road, weaving on a high headland, narrowed
to a single track with frequent turnouts to let a car pass; local
etiquette demands that you salute the turnout-ee. With the timeless
air of the landscape, who's in a hurry anyway?
</P>
<P>
   We rounded a bend to find the road clogged with sheep _
galloping toward us, the lambs bobbing in their stiff-legged way,
like rocking horses. We laughed with delight as their fleeces
brushed past the car.
</P>
<P>
   Further on is the Skye Museum of Island Life, featuring exhibits
of tools, diaries, paintings, photographs and other personal
effects of island crofters (farmers), fishermen and seaweed
harvesters. All of it is cozily tucked into the characteristic
thatched ``black houses'' that were inhabited right up to the
1950s. On the hill behind the museum is a Celtic cross marking the
grave of the aforementioned Flora MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   As the road swings around to the south, toward Staffin and
Portree, the coastline becomes more cliffy and dramatic. One thinks
of Robert Louis Stevenson, who traveled among these islands as a
boy with his lighthouse-builder father and wrote in ``Kidnapped,''
set on the similar Isle of Mull: ``The sea runs deep into the
mountains and winds about their roots, making the country full of
prodigious wild prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   The picturesque ruins of Duntlum Castle, old power base of the
MacDonalds, commands a headland. It was abandoned in 1732, believed
cursed when a nurse dropped a baby out of a window onto the rocks
below. After passing by the imposingly eerie Quiraing rocks and
through the immaculate village of Staffin, we pulled over to take
pictures of Kilt Rock, the most amazing seaside precipice I've seen
outside Ireland's Cliffs of Moher. The tubelike columns of smooth
black basalt make the cliff look a bit like a pleated kilt.
</P>
<P>
   We backtracked to Staffin to stay at the Quiraing Lodge and rest
up for an assault on the Quiraing rocks the next morning, before
heading back to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   An image to remember
</P>
<P>
   In our 40-hour whirlwind tour, we were sorry to miss seals,
puffins and eagles _ all most common, the locals say, out on the
island's northwestern Duirinish Peninsula. Nor did we manage to
catch one of the frequent local rainbows. But a chance encounter of
a different kind had a magical effect.
</P>
<P>
   Late on the evening we arrived, I couldn't resist a little
reconnaissance around Portree, even though it was drizzling.
Following the lane that winds steeply above the Bosville, I looked
out over the harbor and saw a weirdly beautiful sight: a sheer,
towering wall of fog stretching from one cliff to another, neatly
sealing off the harbor, perhaps marking the line where the colder
ocean waters start. I thought of the vanished fishermen who'd had
to plunge into that wall _ and worse _ or starve.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling back into town, I thought I heard Celtic music _
fiddle and accordion _ but it was so faint below the patter of rain
on my umbrella that I couldn't be sure. Most of the town's lights
were out. Finding myself at the dead end of a side street _ a wall
looking straight down on the quay _ I realized the music was coming
from the Celidh (pronounced kaylee) Room pub right beside me.
</P>
<P>
   Peering through the fogged windows, I saw four older couples
clapping and singing in front of the musicians, evidently the
rugged survivors of a long night of revelry. A gray-haired man and
(would it be too much to presume?) his gray-haired wife playfully
circled each other on the little plank dance floor. The music _ the
sound, somehow, of melancholy squeezed and distilled into joy _
built to a head. The man stiffly but gallantly extended his arm,
and the woman, with as much girlish grace as she could muster,
arched her back against it, and for an instant there were flashes
of white teeth in laughing mouths.
</P>
<P>
   I went in for a nightcap.
</P>

 &HT;    CASH-STRAPPED VIRGIN ISLANDS HIDING DIRTY LITTLE SECRET -
GARBAGE
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Aug. 1 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands _ These islands, bathed in
the warm tropical waters of the Atlantic and the Caribbean, are one
of the world's most popular tourist destinations. They boast
undulating verdant slopes, a host of duty-free shops and old
Danish-style buildings lining picturesque waterfronts.
</P>
<P>
   But there are sites locals are well aware of that -- hopefully
-- no tourist will ever see: the Bovoni and Anguilla landfills.
</P>
<P>
   The Bovoni Landfill, on the south side of St. Thomas island, is
an unsightly spectacle of junked cars, discarded appliances and
other garbage. Methane gases smolder underground, so much so that
pockets have exploded, spitting fireballs 30 feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Anguilla Landfill on St. Croix towers 70 feet
high and is less than a half-mile from the Henry E. Rohlsen
International Airport. Aviation officials say birds attracted by
the garbage are endangering airplanes during take-offs and
landings.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the landfills pose a risk to air travelers,
according to environmentalists, they also threaten local residents
who for years have complained of coughs, nausea, and stinging eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone here agrees on the need for new landfills.
That's not the problem. The problem is money. This U.S. territory
is broke.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to mismanagement, hurricane damage and falling tourism
revenues, the Virgin Islands government is burdened with at least
$1 billion in debt, an extraordinary sum for a population of
110,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government has been a notoriously big spender and, at the
same time, a poor planner,'' said Adlah Donastorg, chairman of the
territorial Senate Committee on Planning and Environmental
Protection and a critic of the lack of progress in addressing the
waste problem.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. Charles Turnbull, who inherited a budget
deficit of more than $100 million, as well as a long-term debt of
$1 billion, when he took office last January, said the government
is searching for alternate sites to build landfills but that, so
far, no sites have been located.
</P>
<P>
   He said Turnbull has vowed to chip away at the debt with a
five-year ``austerity plan'' to be unveiled by September.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the three-island chain are saddled with an
extraordinary amount of trash.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the
Virgin Islands generate 9.2 pounds of garbage per person per day,
more than double the U.S. mainland average of 4.4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive trash is partly the result of day-trippers who visit
the islands via cruise ship, as well as all the imported products
packaged in boxes and crates that must be disposed of.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has never implemented a recycling program,
nor has it charged dumping fees at the landfills that might have
incited residents to monitor the garbage generated.
</P>
<P>
   All this has left the landfills overwhelmed with garbage, so
much so that they attract birds that can smash airplane windscreens
and dent propellers.
</P>
<P>
   The landfill in St. Croix violates Federal Aviation
Administration rules that state any site attracting wildlife should
be kept five miles from any airport.
</P>
<P>
   To build a new landfill could cost as much as $70 million,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Not a small sum when the Virgin Islands government is struggling
to pay its utility bills. The debt-ridden U.S. territory owes $16
million for electricity and $17 million for water, according to the
Virgin Islands Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The government can't even afford to maintain its fleet of public
buses, forcing locals to take the nicer, but more expensive tourist
buses.
</P>
<P>
   Irate at this, some critics blame the government _ which has a
budget of about $466 million _ for mismanaging its money.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Donastorg said the islands are represented by 15
senators, an unnecessarily high number. He said millions of dollars
could be saved by cutting the number to nine.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers say a bigger culprit to blame for the islands'
financial fix -- at least partly -- is a decline in the number of
overnight visitors, and the money they spend.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1994, before Hurricane Marilyn hit, visitors
spent $919 million. In 1996, after the hurricane, they spent only
$781 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the number of overnight visitors to the U.S.
territory fell from 555,000 in 1988 to 410,000 last year, a decline
of 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the government is being robbed of essential
tourist dollars, it has spent some $250 million to rebuild on
hotels and other tourist facilities alone over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Hurricane Marilyn, which damaged 80 percent of the
islands, we lost quite a lot of business, and it is taking time to
build that business back up again,'' said Beverly Nicholson,
executive director of the St. Thomas/St. John Hotel Association.
</P>
<P>
   Still, money or no money, Jim Casey, EPA's coordinator for the
Virgin Islands, insisted that some government action must be taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landfills don't comply with EPA rules,'' he said. ``These
are really dumps, and not landfills.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the government monitors what comes in to the landfills,
but that the waste is not screened. He said trash is not separated,
nor is it adequately covered.
</P>
<P>
   Casey said that, under an agreement with the FAA, the Anguilla
Landfill must be closed by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bovoni Landfill will reach capacity within the
next five years. The EPA ordered the government in June to clean up
the site, which is in violation of the Clean Water Act because of
its damage to sensitive tidal salt flats and nearby mangrove
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``These landfills really should have been closed in 1996, but
the money just hasn't been there to find an alternative,'' Casey
said. ``And it's also not easy to find alternative sites on such
tiny islands, so I'm not sure what the government is going to do.''

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ WARSAW _ The Old Town district is where you
find the young people, a fine place for music and beer on warm
summer evenings. So it was that I was here in search of our newest
NATO allies, Warsaw's young warriors, Poland's finest, prepared as
they were to lay down their lives for the NATO way of life.
(Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SATURDAY.

<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ A new suggestion of evidence
that the FBI lied about its actions during the final tragic assault
on the Branch Davidian compound _ as tenuous as it may be _ is
difficult to dismiss. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED FOR
SATURDAY.
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The selling of donor lists by
some PBS affiliates is reprehensible, shameful, insensitive to the
nature and mission of public broadcasting. The same could be said
for those Republicans who are seizing upon the scandal as an excuse
to ``re-examine'' federal funding for public television.(McCarty,
Dayton Daily News) MOVED FOR SATURDAY.
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ For a long time I've
thought that if there is such a thing as reincarnation I'd like to
come back rich and live in South Georgia. Not necessarily
Rockefeller rich, but rich in the way of friends whose hospitality
I've often enjoyed. (Jim Minter is a former editor of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR SATURDAY.

<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Trying to forecast Middle East politics would

are promising. (Tom Teepen is national correspondent for Cox
Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ For those of us fortunate to have insurance
reimbursement for our drugs, the Golden Years are a lot more

half, take them maybe once every three days, or can't afford them
at all. (Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox News Service.)

<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ The real story of the Big Boil of 1999 is not how
many people have been subjected to the heat but rather how many
millions have all but escaped its full impact in
temperature-controlled houses, offices, cars and malls. (Andy Glass
is a columnist for Cox News Service in the Washington bureau.)
MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ After a tension-packed race that
went down to the wire, New York's next U.S. senator, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, celebrated her victory by ripping off her blouse, falling
to her knees and screaming for joy. By pulling off her top in a
sign of triumph, New York's next senator was following the recent
example of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who pulled off
her blouse after the televised signing of a new Mideast peace
accord between Palestinian and Israeli leaders in the White House
Rose Garden. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald). MOVED THURSDAY FOR

   GEEWAX-Y2K-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ For millions of Americans,
nothing fosters a sense of security quite like a fat roll of crisp
$20 bills. Polls show that as more people begin preparing for New
Year's Day and the computer problems that may come with it, the
desire to hoard cash is growing. The Federal Reserve Bank is
bracing for large cash withdrawals late in the year, even while
assuring customers that such stockpiling is unnecessary. (Geewax,

   SCIENCE/MEDICINE
</P>
<P>
   TWIN-DOCS _ Identical twins Travis and Travan Jasper were born
37 seconds apart. In high school they were co-valedictorians; they
went to the same college, medical school, and residency program,
where they both chose emergency medicine as a specialty. Now they
both teach at Emory University School of Medicine and work in
emergency departments in the Emory system, though never in the same
one at the same time to cut down risky confusion. Their story's
already unusual, but it has an extra component: They're
African-American, working in one of the whitest specialties in
medicine. With pictures of the docs in the ER and out of their
white coats, together. (McKenna, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30.
WEIGHT-LOSS _ How I took the weight off and kept it off. (Heisler,
Palm Beach Post). 12.
</P>
<P>
   PARENTING _ If you are sick of reading parenting books that are
peppered with lists and advice, Dr. Kyle Pruett has a solution. In
his latest book, Me, Myself and I: How Children Build Their Sense
of Self (Goddard Press, $19.95) Pruett guides parents on how to
shape children from 18 months to 36 months. (Dayton Daily News).
10. SEA-LICE _ A Boynton Beach, Fla., company says it has the
answer to the itchy, red stings of sea lice, hornets, ants and
other native Florida pests. International Ozone's Lands End Oil
deactivates the venom in bites and stings to stop itching and
swelling, according to company representatives. (Palm Beach Post).

   DEPRESSION WALK _ Almost every day for the past three months,
someone has stopped Stuart Perry on the road, wanting to talk about
depression. Since May, Perry has walked on back roads from Georgia
to Chicago talking about depression to anyone who would listen. He
began his trek to educate people about the devastating illness and
to give hope about treatment. (Miller, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   ANTIOXIDENTS GAIN RESPECT -- An increasing number of people
believe that antioxidants _ certain vitamins, minerals and
plant-based chemicals _ are the key to maintaining health if you
live in a city with high levels of air pollution and other toxic

   RELIGION-JAKES _ ATLANTA _ He's big and he's back. Bishop T. D.
Jakes, dubbed the black Billy Graham, spends much of the week in
Atlanta, talking to tens of thousands of women taking part in his
``Woman, Thou Art Loosed'' revival at the Georgia Dome. Jakes has
turned himself into a mini-industry, pastoring a mega-church in
Dallas, writing books and lecturing across the country. We explore
the reasons for his success and what the future holds as he wraps
up his latest visit to the metro area. (Blake, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 25. EMBARGOED UNTIL 0731
</P>
<P>
   WITH CHURCH-WOMEN _ ATLANTA _ The church has pushed women aside
for years, even told them to keep quiet in church. But they've
always been around, always been pushing for change, always been the
congregants who got work done. Now, more than ever, they are being
noticed and, in some cases, being accepted as leaders. Bishop T.D.
Jakes, a Dallas-based minister who has a national following,
understands the power of women and their importance in the church.
Other pastors are also taking notice. We talk with Jakes about his
ministry, his interest in empowering women, and what the future
holds. (Blake, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25. WITH PHOTO.

<P>
   COPTIC-VISIT _ For many Egyptian immigrants in the Miami Valley,
this is the most important summer of their lives. Pope Shenouda
III, the patriarch of the Coptic religion, is visiting St. Mina &AMP;
St. Abunoub Coptic Orthodox Church in Centerville Aug. 20. It is
the first time the patriarch has come to southwestern Ohio. ``It is
really a big event for us,'' said Father John Ragheb, 41. ``We are
really excited _ for some it will be their first time to meet him,
and they will be very honored.'' (Dayton Daily News). 15. WITH
PHOTO. RELIGION-CONVERTS _ Not so many years ago, Eugene Genovese
was a committed communist and his wife, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, a
feminist scholar with a Marxist point of view. Not only that but
they had been nonbelievers almost all their lives. But today the
Genoveses are devout Catholics, taking Holy Communion each week at
the Cathedral of Christ the King in Buckhead. (Skube, Atlanta

   SPACE-SHUTTLE (Undated) _ Two decades after its birth, and 13

<P>
   HISPANICS-POLITICS (Austin, Texas) _ Raised in the Depression
and educated a half-century ago in a South Texas few Hispanics can
forget, Joe Bernal has a special interest in the campaign for the
White House this year. At 72, Bernal can recall when minority
outreach by political candidates consisted of paying a person's
poll tax and, on good days, getting some tamales and beer to wash
down the ignominy of casting a ballot for the status quo. By JAIME
CASTILLO. (For release Sunday, Aug. 1.)
</P>

<P>
   RADIO-CONFLICT (Undated) _ The bitter dispute at the nation's

revolutionary unrest. By ALAN TURNER.

   CALIF-GAS (San Francisco) _ Two environmental groups have gone

   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ The power of online chat _ in which
people type text messages to each other via computers _ is now at
the center of a fascinating game of cat and rat between AOL and
Microsoft. It's a wonderful battle of wills, a situation in which
roles are reversed, and a classic example of how the Internet
really does change everything. By DWIGHT SILVERMAN.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-HELPLINE (Undated) _ A reader asks, ``Many folks,

Union Square with thousands of their contemporaries shrieking their
lungs out at the every movement of the reigning Queen of Teen,
Britney Spears. By CRAIG MARINE.
</P>
<P>
   TV-TITLES (Pasadena, Calif.) _ It's bad enough that we're often
left with the gnawing feeling that most television shows are merely
tinkered versions of what we've seen before. With notable
exceptions, we wonder if Hollywood has run out of ideas. Now we
have to wonder if television has even run out of titles. By MARK
MCGUIRE.
</P>

 &HT;    Leave public broadcasting alone
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The selling of donor lists by some PBS affiliates
is reprehensible, shameful, insensitive to the nature and mission
of public broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for those Republicans who are seizing
upon the scandal as an excuse to ``re-examine'' federal funding for
public television.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I'm mad at the 26 PBS stations that have swapped donor
lists with political parties. But I'm even madder at the
Republicans exploiting the scandal as a pretext to dredge up their
deep-seated antipathy for any federal funding for public
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about throwing out the baby with the bath water. If our
public libraries became embroiled in scandal, would politicians be
calling for an end to federal support?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. You punish the individuals involved, not the
whole organization.
</P>
<P>
   PBS president Ervin S. Duggan is recommending an independent
investigation into whether the list-swapping violates federal tax
law. That question, certainly, deserves scrutiny _ but so do the
motives of those who would yank federal funding from public
broadcasting, which enriches all our lives in innumerable ways.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic that the funding review is being called for so soon
after the Columbine tragedy. Remember all the soul-searching about
violence in the media? Yet here we have some members of Congress
who refuse to rein in the NRA, but can't wait to clip the wings of
public broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   I know I'm not the only parent, Republican or Democrat, who
feels PBS is the one place you can park the kids without their
being bombarded with garbage _ be it sex, violence or commercial
brainwashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, we do hear from parents who are looking for a
safe haven for their children,'' said David Fogarty, president and
general manager of WPTD-TV (Channel 16) and WPTO-TV (Channel 14).
</P>
<P>
   It's not only wild-eyed liberals who share my enthusiasm for
public TV. Our local PBS stations are heavily supported by
corporations, community leaders, citizens of every political
stripe. ``We have the area's largest membership organization of
23,000 members,'' Fogarty said, ``and those folks are as diverse as
this community, politically and in every other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the federal government gives $250 million a year to
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting _ less than a dollar for
every American. Do we really want to fall even farther behind
countries like Canada and Great Britain in our support of this
vital public resource?
</P>
<P>
   WPTD and WPTO received $650,000 in federal funding last year,
roughly 10 percent of the stations' annual budgets _ already a
``significant drop'' since 1995, Fogarty said. Further reductions
would prompt ``a critical look at what programs we could purchase,
and whether we stay on the air 24 hours a day,'' Fogarty said.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes the scandal won't undermine the trust of the public,
who contribute more than half the stations' budgets. ``We want
people to know that if they're a donor, their names are safe with
us,'' Fogarty said.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that the scandal proves PBS can survive in the open
market. ``Big Bird is strong enough to fly on his own,'' wrote
Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby. ``It's time he was told to
leave the nest.''
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to the marketplace, the thinking goes.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the marketplace has brought us ``Melrose Place'' and
``Jerry Springer.'' Public television has brought us ``Sesame
Street,'' ``Masterpiece Theater,'' Ken Burns' ``The Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I hope Big Bird sticks around

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: South Georgia's good life
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ For a long time I've thought that if there
is such a thing as reincarnation I'd like to come back rich and
live in South Georgia. Not necessarily Rockefeller rich, but rich
in the way of friends whose hospitality I've often enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   They all have a pickup that runs good, two or three shotguns, a
carport full of fishing poles, a couple of bird dogs, and
good-looking wives who don't give them much trouble as long as they
stay out of fistfights at Georgia football games and don't get too
friendly with the waitresses at the Moose Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   I've wondered if life below the gnat line is really that good,
or if it just looks that way from a distance. After Dwain Walden's
book arrived in the mail, I no longer have doubts. Life in South
Georgia is just as wonderful as I suspected.
</P>
<P>
   Dwain is editor of the Moultrie Observer, and has been since
1981. Born in Cairo, raised on a farm near Whigham, he earned his
journalism degree at Georgia State University while carefully
avoiding citification. His book is a collection of columns from the
Observer. No persons raised in South Georgia, or who wish they had
been, should be without ``From My Back Porch.'' You can get a copy
by writing the Moultrie Observer in Moultrie.
</P>
<P>
   Life in South Georgia is different from Atlanta, or from Middle
Georgia, or from North Georgia. South Georgians are more laid back.
They have perfected an ambience perhaps unique in all the world. An
example is Dwain's complaint about stress caused by having to
decide whether to go fishing or barbecue ribs.
</P>
<P>
   His book is about, among other things, butterbeans, crowder
peas, roastneers (roasting ears), lightered (lightwood) knots,
washholes, religion, bird dogs, fishing the Ochlockonee,
skinny-dipping, religion, marriage, vegetable gardens, UFOs,
neighbors, heart pine pews, and how everybody bunches up in front
of the macaroni and fried chicken when the Providence Baptist
Church has dinners on the grounds. It paints, along with the
laughs, the most authentic picture of farm and small-town life I
know about.
</P>
<P>
   Although the author grew up a few years behind me, similarities
in our rural past are amazing. I certainly understood when he wrote
about the rocking chair: ``It was on my grandma's front porch.
Before we had a television I'd climb into this big, high-back
rocker with a cowhide bottom and journey to far-off places. I drove
a stagecoach, piloted the African Queen, dodged poisonous arrows,
and even turned a triple play ...
</P>
<P>
   ``A corn field across the road was the Amazon jungle.
Silhouettes of great water oaks were giants I held at bay. Distant
headlights were the torches of an advancing army. A cow's bellow
was the roar of a rogue lion on the Serengeti Plain. A dog barking
was one of Jack London's wolves.'' (How does that compare to an
afternoon of strolling a shopping mall?)
</P>
<P>
   I spent many summer afternoons in my own grandmother's
front-porch swing, seated under an armrest, bare feet dangling,
pumping the swing sideways, piloting a B-17 over Frankfurt and
Berlin, dodging Messerschmitts and German flak, bombing Hitler to
smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   Something else the South Georgian and I have in common are
vegetable gardens, and wives who wonder why we have them. Dwain
says it happens every spring. ``She asks me why I plant a vegetable
garden, when considering all the time and expense I put into it I
could buy the produce at much less the cost.'' He always gives her
the same answer: ``Because.''
</P>
<P>
   Because his father always planted one, and before that his
grandfather, and before that his grandfather's father, all the way
back to Ireland and the potato famine.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how kids growing up 200 miles and almost two decades
apart remember the same insignificant tidbits. Dwain retains
cherished memory of his father thumping watermelons to see if they
were ripe, and how the two halves fell apart under his Barlow
knife.
</P>
<P>
   My boys were in a conversation just last week about how their
grandfather, gone 30 years now, cut their watermelons. He used a
string instead of a knife. I can't explain why, but when he did,
kids stood around to watch, as if he was performing magic.
</P>
<P>
   In Attapulgus and Whigham and thereabouts, a fire in a fireplace
is much more than a place to keep warm. ``I think some of the
greatest thoughts have come from in front of a fireplace,'' Dwain
speculates. ``The purveyor of those thoughts focused on yellow
tongues licking oak logs, warmed by the flames and subsequent
insights into the mysteries of the universe, like: `Why did God
make mosquitoes?'''
</P>
<P>
   Dwain Walden is a man who takes his mother bream fishing for her
Mother's Day present, remembers what he learned at Providence
Baptist Church, shares bologna sandwiches with his bird dog, and
complains about having to negotiate a four-way stop every day when
he drives home to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   I love his reply when a friend asked him what he did last Friday
night: ``Sat on the back porch and listened to the rain.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Feds have only themselves to blame for Davidian raid
skeptics
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A new suggestion of evidence that the FBI lied
about its actions during the final tragic assault on the Branch
Davidian compound _ as tenuous as it may be _ is difficult to
dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   After all, officials with the FBI, the Justice Department and
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms so severely damaged
their credibility during and following the incident that it is
difficult to accept these recent denials of wrongdoing at face
value.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest development, the appointed board chairman of the
Texas Department of Public Safety said he believes that evidence
recovered from the charred remains of the Branch Davidian compound
appears to contradict FBI and Justice Department claims that agents
did not use incendiary devices on the day of the fiery assault.
</P>
<P>
   Before a worldwide television audience on the windy morning of
April 19, 1993, FBI tanks attacked the compound and pumped massive
quantities of disabling gas into the building.
</P>
<P>
   Branch Davidian survivors have claimed that FBI agents fired
into the building and that government incendiary devices were
responsible for the fire and the resulting deaths of 76 men, women
and children inside the building. Autopsies revealed that 17
Davidians died from gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to end the 51-day siege with a tank assault was
made by Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI tactical agents over
the objections of FBI behavioral experts who warned that the action
could cause a mass suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Balancing the conflicting claims of the followers of David
Koresh, the Branch Davidians' apocalyptic leader, and federal law
enforcement agents would be no problem for most Americans had
government officials not been caught in a swirl of lies, cover-ups,
evasions and denials.
</P>
<P>
   Paranoid, anti-government conspiracy zealots maintain that ATF
and FBI agents purposefully massacred the innocent Davidians, which
is preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans believe that the Davidians _ at least their
leaders _ were not innocent and that the government made a series
of flawed decisions that led to the tragic ending, which is not
preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials conducted a self-examination of
their own actions and produced a massive three-volume, 1,000-page
report filled with self-praise and no blame. The New York Times
properly called the report a whitewash.
</P>
<P>
   The reason no one in the Justice Department or the FBI was
blamed for wrong decisions or actions was because no one did
anything wrong, Americans were told. ``People should get blamed if
they did something wrong,'' Reno said. No wrong, no blame.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the administration should have insisted on an
independent investigation of Justice Department and FBI actions.
They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department ordered an independent investigation
into the actions of ATF agents in the botched initial raid. That
report listed a series of lies, cover-ups and mistakes by ATF
officials, who received little or no punishment.
</P>
<P>
   DPS Chairman James B. Francis Jr., according to the Dallas
Morning News, said evidence held by the state indicates that the
sort of incendiary devices that the FBI claims it did not use were
found in areas of the compound where fires broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Francis also said FBI agents made statements to Texas Rangers
after the fire ``that are contradictory'' to the government's
subsequent account of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some evidence there that the world needs to see, in
my opinion,'' Francis said. ``The government does not want this
evidence out, and yet, that's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman called the allegations nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so. But Justice Department officials have no one to
blame but themselves for their unbelievable claims of
blamelessness.

   TWIN-DOCS _ Identical twins Travis and Travan Jasper were born
37 seconds apart. In high school they were co-valedictorians; they
went to the same college, medical school, and residency program,
where they both chose emergency medicine as a specialty. Now they
both teach at Emory University School of Medicine and work in
emergency departments in the Emory system, though never in the same
one at the same time to cut down risky confusion. Their story's
already unusual, but it has an extra component: They're
African-American, working in one of the whitest specialties in
medicine. With pictures of the docs in the ER and out of their
white coats, together. (McKenna, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For millions of Americans, nothing fosters a sense
of security quite like a fat roll of crisp $20 bills.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that as more people begin preparing for New Year's
Day and the computer problems that may come with it, the desire to
hoard cash is growing. The Federal Reserve Bank is bracing for
large cash withdrawals late in the year, even while assuring
customers that such stockpiling is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The cash craving is being fed by fears about the ``Y2K bug,'' a
software flaw that will cause some older computers to interpret
dates ending in ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000. That
misunderstanding has the potential to shut down the computerized
systems that control everything from power generators to financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Though programmers are racing to correct the problem, some
people doubt they will finish the job in time to avert disruptions
in many basic services. A poll conducted by the Associated Press in
mid-July found that one-quarter of Americans plan to take extra
money out of the bank in case problems arise, such as automated
teller machines that stop working or power outages that keep banks
closed.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for a possible grab for greenbacks in December, the
nation's central bank is increasing the value of its cash inventory
by the end of September to more than $200 billion, up from its
usual $150 billion. By some estimates, that increase would provide
enough cash for each U.S. household to withdraw an extra $500 for
New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Fed governors last(cq) month voted to make
special loans to banks, thrifts and credit unions that might need
emergency funds because of consumer fears about Y2K. The loans will
be offered from Oct. 1 to April 7 to help financial institutions
``more confidently commit'' to making loans to other banks during
the Y2K transition.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said last(cq)
month that the efforts to fix Y2K-related problems in the banking
and financial system have been so ``exhaustive'' that ``we expect
the full array of payment options to work'' as usual after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most risky activity people can take is to take all their
currency out of their banks because there will be a new industry
that will emerge as a consequence ... millenium thievery,'' he told
the Senate Banking Committee last week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, bankers point out that dollars can be destroyed by
fire, and
</P>
<P>
   money in the mattress is not insured for free up to $100,000, as
it is in a federally insured institution.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said ``the most sensible thing'' to do on Dec. 31 is
to keep your money insured and earning interest in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers in many major industrialized nations share the Fed's
belief that cash hoarding is unnecessary and even foolhardy. Still,
the central banks in Japan, Britain, Canada, Sweden, Italy,
Switzerland and Singapore are printing more money to prepare for
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And while hoarding cash can be unsafe for individuals, it isn't
risk-free for bankers either. According to a report by the Bank of
England on Y2K preparations, the huge stacks of bills will create
so many security problems that many banks around the world are
planning to stash money in secret locations.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Y2K may create opportunities for those who
prey on armored vehicles. With an extra $50 billion moving in
trucks from the Treasury Department's Bureau of Printing and
Engraving to the Fed's vaults around the nation, guards will have
more money to watch over.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone will be interested in obtaining paper
bills. For those who believe Y2K will trigger social and economic
catastrophes, gold is the answer. For months, companies that sell
gold coins have been urging people to buy the glittering metal to
use in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, which opens with the phrase ``Year 2000 News
Flash: Economic Crisis Grips World,'' is offering consumers a
``Gold Jubilee Pack'' of 50 gold medallions bearing likenesses of
religious leaders. For $1,770, consumers get a pack of coins
weighing 4.58 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site does not mention that this year, gold prices have
tumbled, recently falling to a 20-year low. At current prices, 4.58
ounces of gold is worth less than $1,200.

 &HT;    Doormaker's book makes doormaking a do-it-yourself job
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Building a door _ a front entry door, not a cabinet door _ is
something I've thought about, but never even got close to doing.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrival of a new book from Sterling, ``Doormaking: A
Do-It-Yourself Guide,'' by John Birchard, may get me going again.
This $20 softbound book is written by a California doormaker, so
most of the designs are inventive and informal, but the main value
of the book is the general information on building a door that will
last.
</P>
<P>
   There is a detailed discussion of how to work the design around
conditions, such as the amount of exposure the door has to the
elements and the direction in which it faces, and the best ways of
installing doors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most useful parts of the book is the discussion of
finishing and maintenance. The finishing of wood exposed to sun and
weather has always been a problem for me, and Birchard makes it
abundantly clear that it's a problem for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   However, he does define the options and their consequences, and
provides the best solutions for various situations.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I think about replacing our front door, which
although battered looks OK from the outside, I notice the interior
side of it. One would think we had been housing a restless bobcat.
Long, ugly scratch markings run from the floor all the way to the
doorknob.
</P>
<P>
   Sound advice
</P>
<P>
   In response to recent discussions of quality woodworking tools,
I received an e-mail that I think is worth passing on. The
gentleman writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``I represent a distributor of woodworking power tools and find
myself faced with the same questions, day-in and day-out, relating
to the purchase of inexpensive equipment that will perform to the
high expectations of the purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a daily basis we have customers come into our store wanting
to purchase a new fence for their 'cost efficient' table saw they
bought elsewhere. They are immediately faced with one or two
problems. Chances are the better grade fence will not fit on their
saw and if it does the cost is far greater than they anticipated.
They also find that other accessories (i.e. good tenoning jigs,
etc.) do not fit their saws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company does not pay commissions to our sales personnel.
We stress selling the right tool for the needs of the customer. We
will not attempt to sell an arbor saw to someone needing a
contractor's saw. I mention this because when we determine needs of
a customer we also attempt to get them to foresee what they will be
doing in the future. We do not tell a customer to purchase a
contractor saw in anticipation of later upgrading it with a 52-inch
fence, table board, etc. but explain to them that if they purchase
a high quality saw and maintain it properly they will be able to
sell it later, and put that money toward a saw that will meet their
new needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently I had a customer who owned a contractor saw that was
manufactured by one of the companies you recommended. He wanted to
add a table board and a larger fence. I figured the cost of
upgrading and then figured what he could sell his contractor saw
for and subtracted it from the cost of a Jet 52-inch arbor saw.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, the gentleman reports, was that it would cost a lot
more to upgrade than to sell and buy, and in the case of upgrading
the customer would still have had a 1 1/2 HP saw instead of a 3 HP.
He continues:
</P>
<P>
   ``One other matter that should be mentioned. While I am partial
to Delta and Jet (we sell these brands), your readers should be
cautioned about the fact that these companies have or are selling
``low-end'' equipment such as the Delta Contractor II saw and the
Jet Shopline.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the fact that he agrees with me, I'm passing this
man's advice on to you for another reason _ he had the amazing good
taste and class not to mention the name of his store.

 &HT;    Cajun reunion expected to draw record numbers
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABBEVILLE, La. - Joe and Barbara Hebert have the same last name,
but not simply because they've been married for more than 45 years.
They're both Heberts by birth, and they share a great-great-great
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not really that amazing in Louisiana,'' Barbara Hebert
Hebert said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 13,000 Louisiana families are named Hebert -- pronounced
A-Bear -- making it the most common surname here. They'll be joined
August 6-8 by Heberts from around the world who are coming to
Abbeville to celebrate their Acadian heritage. This reunion and 80
others across the state are at the heart of a two-week celebration
of Acadian heritage that begins August 1.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Congres Mondial Acadien, or the World Acadian
Congress, the statewide event is expected to attract half a million
visitors with names like Boudreaux, Gautreaux and Prejean.
Acadians, usually called Cajuns in Louisiana, will two-step,
fiddle, speak French, cook gumbos and crack crabs while they share
their common roots, which stretch back to Canada, and before that,
to France.
</P>
<P>
   The first world Acadian reunion, in 1994 in New Brunswick,
Canada, drew 225,000 Acadians. The Louisiana gathering is expected
to be the largest reunion of the Acadians since their expulsion
from Canada in 1755.
</P>
<P>
   ''Historically, we've been scattered to the winds,'' said Brian
Gabriel Comeaux, president and executive director of the congress.
''This is an attempt to get everybody together.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick history lesson:
</P>
<P>
   Acadians are descended from rural French folks who settled in
Acadia, Canada in the 1600s. In 1755, British Canadians, on the
verge of war with France, deported thousands of Acadians after they
refused to pledge their allegiance to the British crown. Many died
along the way, and many families were separated in an attempt to
weaken their resolve to return.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 refugees wound up in Louisiana, which had a heavy
French influence even though it was then a Spanish territory. They
settled in the swamps and prairies of Southeast Louisiana, becoming
trappers, loggers, farmers, and fishermen. Their new home was
called Acadiana.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are large concentrations of Acadians in Louisiana,
eastern Canada, and rural France. There are smaller Acadian
communities in Texas, Massachusetts and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half a million Louisianans claim Acadian ancestry and
call themselves Cajuns. Many more Louisianans of Scottish, German,
Spanish, Caribbean and African-American descent who have
intermarried with the original Acadians call themselves Cajuns as
well. About 250,000 residents claim French as the primary language
they speak at home, according to the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cajuns are Louisianans who embrace the culture and maybe speak
French,'' Mrs. Hebert said. ''But Acadians are real descendants of
those from Canada. So you can be Cajun without being Acadian, but
if you are Acadian, you are also a Cajun.''
</P>
<P>
   The world congress is the crowning event of FrancoFete, a
year-long celebration of the 300th anniversary of French influence
in Louisiana. The other major tourist draw of FrancoFete is an
exhibit of works by French Impressionist Edgar Degas, on display
through August at the New Orleans Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the only state that claims such a strong French
heritage,'' said Delia Taylor, spokeswoman with Lt. Gov. Kathleen
Babineaux Blanco's office, which oversees tourism. ''We have so
many people here that speak French, we have parishes instead of
counties, and we are the only state that follows the Napoleonic
Code. Even if you don't have French blood in your veins, you still
have French culture all around you if you live here.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic impact of FrancoFete likely will set a record for
tourism in the state, pushing close to $8 billion. And an
unprecedented 28 million visitors are expected to come to Louisiana
this year.
</P>
<P>
   While the family reunions are the highlight of the world
congress, there are hundreds of events planned, including
festivals, opening and closing ceremonies, French Catholic masses,
and academic conferences. The conferences focus on genealogy, on
diseases that have a higher incidence among Acadians, and on the
preservation of the culture and the French language in Acadian
children.
</P>
<P>
   This last issue is particularly important to Louisianans. Older
Cajuns such as the Heberts -- Joe is 71 and Barbara is 68 --
remember when being Cajun was something to be ashamed of. Both grew
up speaking only French, and were quickly admonished and encouraged
to speak English once they started school. Many children were
punished if they spoke French.
</P>
<P>
   ''My grandmother spoke only French,'' Joe Hebert said. When he
left Louisiana with his new bride in 1952 to become an Air Force
weather officer, he remembers being looked down upon for being
Cajun.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara clung to her Cajun French and eventually learned
standard French so she could teach it. She taught French and German
in high schools for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   When the Heberts retired five years ago, they decided to return
home to Louisiana. They were delighted to find Cajun culture had
become not only accepted, but trendy. Cajun music and food are now
known throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now there is a real renaissance of people wanting to learn
French,'' Mrs. Hebert said. Some school systems in the state have
French immersion programs, where students not only take French
classes but also take other subjects in French, such as math and
science.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've started speaking French in restaurants together,'' said
Russell Gaspard, 66, an organizer of the Hebert reunion in
Abbeville. Gaspard's mother was an Hebert. His wife is teaching
their grandchildren to speak French, in part to erase guilty
feelings over not teaching it to their children.
</P>
<P>
   The Abbeville reunion will be one of the larger gatherings, and
will include a dance, a French mass, the unveiling of a monument
marking the event, and genealogy seminars.
</P>
<P>
   But the highlight of the weekend will be the cooking of the
giant omelette. Normally a November event, the Giant Omelette
Celebration will take place a second time this year, on August 7,
for the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to show off,'' Gaspard said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Giant'' is no exaggeration: The omelette is made with 5,000
eggs and is cooked on a 12-foot wide skillet in front of the
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The event, in its 14th year here, is not as silly as it sounds.
Its origins go back to 18th-century France; legend has it that
Napoleon Bonaparte once ordered the village of Bessieres in the
south of France to make his army a giant omelette.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Bessieres began staging an annual giant omelette
festival. Now six cities worldwide with French ties have an
omelette event; Abbeville is the only U.S. city. The omelette chefs
are called ''chevaliers'' or ''knights'' and are part of a
fraternal order that promotes cultural exchange and friendship
among French-loving people. Joe and Barbara Hebert are chevaliers
and have traveled to every omelette city.
</P>
<P>
   To give their omelette a Cajun flavor, the chevaliers of
Abbeville add Tabasco sauce and crawfish tails to the usual 5,000
eggs, 50 pounds of onions, two gallons of parsley and 52 pounds of
butter.
</P>
<P>
   Gaspard, who has been looking forward to a Louisiana reunion for
more than a decade, says he has no idea if 600 or 6,000 Heberts
will come to Abbeville, a sleepy, picturesque town famous for its
oysters. He's worried the Heberts from Canada won't like the steamy
weather August in Louisiana promises, but he sums up his
predictions of how things will go like this:
</P>
<P>
   ''If they don't have a good time, well, tsk tsk tsk.''

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani provided his
fellow New Yorkers with some fetching entertainment this week. He
journeyed down to Arkansas to rub elbows with razorbacks.
</P>
<P>
   As Hillary Rodham Clinton made another ``listening tour'' across
upstate New York, the mayor decided to do some listening of his own
in the rural state where Mrs. Clinton first served as a first lady.
At the invitation of Arkansas' new Republican governor, Mike
Huckabee, Giuliani loped off to Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never been here before,'' the governor told reporters,
``he's never worked here, he's never lived here. Today he will be
announcing his candidacy for some significant major office in
Arkansas, we're told.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon Giuliani's arrival in Little Rock, his hotel promptly ran
up the New York state flag. City Hall responded by flying the
Arkansas flag over lower Manhattan. New York City Councilman Bill
Perkins, a black Democrat, was incensed. He said that he was
``outraged that the Arkansas flag that is designed to commemorate
the Confederacy, i.e., slavery, and the Old South is flying from
City Hall, our city's bastion of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Really, this is more fun than the circus, bigger belly laughs
than Wrestlemania.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Perkins has a point. One of the blue stars in the
Arkansas flag really does represent the state's membership in the
confederacy. New York Gov. George Pataki not long ago removed the
flag of another southern state from the Albany Capitol because it
contained a confederate symbol. Minority lawmakers were bent out of
shape over its presence in the Capitol's Hall of Flags.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, though, seems to have adopted more of a
forgive-and-forget attitude than he usually demonstrates. Maybe
that's because he raised about $200,000 in Little Rock to use in
what everybody now presumes will be his battle next year against
Hillary Clinton for the U.S. Senate from New York _ assuming that
either of them ultimately runs and that Giuliani really can get the
Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, it appears that he'll have a primary fight from
Rep. Rick Lazio, a Republican from Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Against Clinton, Giuliani's big issue would be the charge that
Hillary was trying to pull a Bobby Kennedy. In 1964, Kennedy came
roaring into New York and won a Senate seat against Ken Keating, a
snowy-haired incumbent who hadn't been bothering anybody. Kennedy
was denounced, as Clinton is being denounced now, as a shameless
carpetbagger.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody thought that was a problem back then, however. For
example, a columnist for the Manhattan College newspaper, the
Quadrangle, wrote an impassioned attack on the people criticizing
Bobby Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They maintain that Kennedy is a cynical, power-hungry
politician moving into New York and using it as a springboard to
higher office ...'' the columnist wrote. ``The `carpetbagger'
issue, which has so far been the only issue Sen. Keating has gotten
any response on, is a truly ridiculous reason for not voting for a
man in the year 1964 ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Without doubt, the Kennedy candidacy is perfectly in accord
with the Constitutional stipulation that a Senator must be a
resident of the state he represents on the day he is elected ... A
Kennedy victory will bring about the assertion of a most valuable
precedent; that a representative of a particular state must be able
to think and vote in the light of national needs and not to be tied
only to local and sectional pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   The columnist made a ferocious assault on ``sectional
divisions'' and ``outdated parochialism.'' Vote for the candidate
and not the address, a young Rudolph Giuliani urged his readers in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   I found out about this when an Albany-area Democratic Party
activist named C.B. Smith stumbled across a copy of the column on a
Web site called thesmokinggun.com. Smith thought he had died and
gone to Heaven, and he couldn't wait to let me know about it. I
called up the Web site, and there it was. And Giuliani's people say
it's legitimate. He wrote that column, all right.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that was then, and this is now. Giuliani's people say that
he has grown up considerably in 35 years. He probably didn't
mention any of this in Little Rock. The rubes might not have found
it amusing.
</P>

IRISH BREWERY TAKES ITS BEER SERIOUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Alicia Shiel eyes the clear plastic tubes
running from the keg room to the polished wooden bar at Foley's
Irish House and pronounces them clean and clear of nasty
micro-organisms.
</P>
<P>
   She climbs the stairs, goes behind the bar and lifts a 20-ounce
imperial pint glass. Tilting it under the tap at a 45-degree angle,
Shiel pours night-black stout into the glass, pauses to allow the
liquid to settle, sniffs the brew for freshness, then tops it off
with a creamy head.
</P>
<P>
   Voila _ a toothsome pint, which Shiel passes to a surprised and
pleased Foley's tippler as a free sample to go with the whiskey
he's been quietly sipping at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   It's all in a day's work for Shiel, one of 43 draft specialists
employed in the United States by Guinness Bass Import Co., the
Greenwich, Conn.-based distributors of Guinness stout, Bass ale,
Harp lager and other drinks from Guinness's base in Ireland and the
United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinness is different,'' says Shiel, an Irishwoman from Dublin
who lives in San Francisco. Impatient American bartenders have to
be persuaded to pour Guinness' signature stout just-so and wait the
one to two minutes it takes to settle. And American drinkers, who
fancy light beers and lagers, may need some time to appreciate
Guinness's robust flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Draft specialists like Shiel check refrigeration and delivery
systems in bars and restaurants to ensure quality control, and
serve as good-will ambassadors for beer companies.
</P>
<P>
   Their personal touch and attention to detail are especially
useful for marketing imports and craft beers, which are niche
players in the big U.S. beer market. Imports had 8 percent of the
market in 1998, and craft beers _ made in small batches by
traditional brewing methods _ owned 3 percent that same year,
according to the Association of Brewers, in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   An international company like Guinness _ a brewing giant that
pours 10 million pints daily worldwide, according to communications
director Howard Pulchin, but has a relatively small market here _
must be enterprising to differentiate itself.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness' specialist program is one way to do that.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco area is the company's prime U.S. market after
New York, says Tim Kelly, Guinness Imports president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The section of the market we're in is very big here,'' Kelly
says. ``There are a lot of young people here; there is a lot of
money here; Silicon Valley is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness is not the only company to go after market share by
tapping draft-beer wizards, to be sure. Draft-beer pioneer Anchor
Brewing Co., of San Francisco, and major brewer Coors Brewing Co.,
of Golden, Colo., among others, also send technicians into the
field to look after things.
</P>
<P>
   Coors, the third-largest domestic brewer, with 10.5 percent of
the U.S. market, requires independent distributors who handle Coors
beer to employ draft specialists, according to Dave Taylor, the
company's communications manager.
</P>
<P>
   These specialists ``attend a course provided by Coors on our
beer, and they are certified through our training system,'' Taylor
says.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Coors draft isn't pasteurized and doesn't include
preservatives or stabilizers, it must be served within 45 days,
kept well-refrigerated in storage and poured at a chilly 36
degrees, according to Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor Brewing, which makes the highly regarded Anchor Steam
beer, plus Liberty ale, a porter and other drinks, doesn't specify
temperature, according to Anchor's Philip Rogers. ``We have the
philosophy that if the temperature is good to you, it's good
beer,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   However, Anchor is quite serious about ensuring quality, working
with distributors who employ draft managers of their own to oversee
its systems.
</P>
<P>
   One such company, the independently owned Anchor Distributing
Co. of San Rafael, ensures that the lines linking kegs of Anchor
Steam to barroom taps are narrower than usual. Anchor _ brewed with
a high amount of naturally occurring carbonation and known for its
thick, creamy head _ would be all foam if too much CO2 bubbled into
the glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite a bit more involved in setting up Anchor,'' says
Don Saccani, president and general manager of Anchor Distributing.
``There is an applied physics that takes place.''
</P>
<P>
   While many beer companies use specialists, Guinness impresses
bar owners as exceptionally attentive to detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy product to pour, but quality is No. 1 with
Guinness. They'd rather not sell it if it's poured badly,'' says
Martin Connolly, co-owner of Foley's Irish House.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's, says Shiel, is careful to serve Guinness in the
traditional way _ poured slowly, with a head ranging from 1/2 inch
to 1 inch high, and chilled to 39-45 degrees. ``It should be served
cold,'' Shiel says _ not warm, as many Americans believe of Irish
and British beers.
</P>
<P>
   Other myths, according to Shiel:
</P>
<P>
   _ Guinness stout is exceptionally potent (it's 4.3 percent
alcohol on draft, about the same as mainstream American beers)
</P>
<P>
   _ It's heavy (``10 calories per ounce; it's a light beer despite
the color,'' she says)
</P>
<P>
   _ Guinness tastes different _ that is to say, better _ in
Ireland and the United Kingdom than it does in the United States.
``It's the exact, same beer, shipped in kegs from the brewery at
St. James's Gate in Dublin,'' she says.

GET IT IN WRITING OR TAKE A BRUISING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: It was with great excitement that I let the
cable modem people in. I had taken a day off work and convinced my
wife that the $100 installation fee was a bargain. Anyway, they
couldn't install it because my apartment had the wrong kind of
cable. They would need to set up an appointment with
``construction'' and then another one with themselves. Oh, yes, and
the fee would go up $75. Faced with almost double the installation
and two more days of missed work, I told them to put everything
back the way it was, and I'd just live with 56K. Was I being
scammed, or did I cut my nose off?
</P>
<P>
   _Noseless
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NOSELESS: Sorry; even though that was pretty cheesy
treatment by the cable modem guys, it doesn't exactly count as a
scam. If ever there was something to read all the fine print about,
it's these high-speed alternatives to regular modems.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the cheapest way to go is with either a digital
subscriber line (DSL) from the phone company or a special modem
that's hooked into your digital cable, in which case the Internet
is delivered on the same wire as Nick at Nite. In either case,
you'll be paying as much as 40 bucks a month for the service on top
of an installation fee, plus a couple of hundred dollars for
equipment. For all that dough, you get to surf at least 10 or 15
times _ maybe a lot more _ faster than you do now.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't just matter that the service is offered in your
area. The wires in your house have to be capable of carrying the
signal. You'd think the cable guys would have known that when you
placed the order, but there's every chance your service rep was
flipping burgers last week and thinks ``digital service'' means you
have to change channels without a remote.
</P>
<P>
   You need to protect yourself. Have the cable or phone company
guarantee that your line is up to snuff in writing. If they won't
do that, at least tape a supervisor telling you that on the phone.
Sure, that's not exactly legal, but think how good it will sound on
``The People's Court.''
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My otherwise sensible husband insists it is
better to leave computers running 24 hours a day. I disagree; I
think they should be shut off entirely when not in use.
</P>
<P>
   _Miffed Wife
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MIFFED: No matter what I say, one of you is going to think
I'm an idiot. How about this? Both of you just do whatever you want
to with your computers and talk about something noncontroversial
like the Mideast instead.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that every time you switch on a computer, the sudden
surge of power can degrade components slightly, but your box will
probably be obsolete and ready to be replaced by the time any real
damage becomes apparent. It's just as true that leaving the power
on all the time puts wear on moving parts like fan and disk-drive
motors, but most of those things can run for four or five years
without a problem, and they're cheap to replace when they do fail.
There's no answer, is there?
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that might tip the scale is if you care about
gobbling up the extra electricity it takes to run your PC
constantly, which isn't too much more than my Spiderman night light
uses.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I do: I turn my computer off when I'm done with it.
If it's on, it's too easy to sit down and lose another three hours
to Half-Life or Quake, and my carpal tunnels are inflamed enough as
it is, thank you.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   of the nation, you know that we're also enduring a slow news
cycle. Reports of
</P>
<P>
   persistent temperature records are coupled with the opinions of
presumed experts
</P>
<P>
   on the meaning of changing weather patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Dehydration that stems from extreme heat can prove fatal. But
</P>
<P>
   doctors have long recognized that sweltering temperatures should
be
</P>
<P>
   properly seen as one of several contributing causes to death
whenever
</P>
<P>
   other serious medical problems are also present.
</P>
<P>
   The real story of the Big Boil of 1999 is not how many people
have
</P>
<P>
   been subjected to the heat but rather how many millions have all
but
</P>
<P>
   escaped its full impact in temperature-controlled houses,
offices,
</P>
<P>
   cars and malls.
</P>
<P>
   Today, three in four American homes are air conditioned.
Houston,
</P>
<P>
   the nation's fourth largest city, plans to spend over $750
million
</P>
<P>
   this year just to keep cool. It's a good investment: In 1900,
only
</P>
<P>
   some 45,000 people lived there, sweltering each summer by the
Texas
</P>
<P>
   Gulf coast.
</P>
<P>
   Like television, air conditioning has been around for much of
the
</P>
<P>
   20th century. A year after earning a master's degree in
electrical
</P>
<P>
   engineering from Cornell in 1901, Willis Carrier patented a unit
that
</P>
<P>
   soon came to comfort the very comfortable, much as private jets
do
</P>
<P>
   today.
</P>
<P>
   But the broad middle class had to wait several more decades for
its
</P>
<P>
   turn. And, by and large, poor people, among whom a good deal of
</P>
<P>
   heat-related suffering occurs, are still unable to obtain
relief.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Hollywood made a movie,
</P>
<P>
   `The Seven Year Itch,'' based on
</P>
<P>
   the premise of a
</P>
<P>
   `bachelor'' who sends his wife and kids to the beach
</P>
<P>
   for the entire summer to escape their sultry apartment, thereby
</P>
<P>
   setting up his sultry escapade with Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager living in a hot and humid New York City in the
1940s,
</P>
<P>
   I'd escort my future wife to a
</P>
<P>
   `healthfully chilled'' movie house on
</P>
<P>
   summer weekend afternoons. There we'd cool off, sitting through
two
</P>
<P>
   feature films, cartoons, newsreels and coming attractions.
</P>
<P>
   As grown-ups in 1970, we bought a house from a partner in a
</P>
<P>
   regional movie chain. When building the house in 1949, he
mounted a
</P>
<P>
   nine-ton water-circulation tower by the driveway, utilizing the
same
</P>
<P>
   crew and much the same gear that served his movie emporiums.
</P>
<P>
   At first all went well once we had found a technician who could
</P>
<P>
   decipher the various dials, valves and switches needed to run
the
</P>
<P>
   massive commercial-grade apparatus. But then came the oil shock
of the
</P>
<P>
   mid-1970s and the sticker shock of soaring electricity bills.
</P>
<P>
   The last straw came when the power company's chieftain wrote to
</P>
<P>
   inform us that we'd been chosen for a
</P>
<P>
   `special study'' by dint of
</P>
<P>
   being among the utility's top 100 residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   Our over-engineered
</P>
<P>
   `movie'' air conditioning system more
</P>
<P>
   powerful than even the pioneering one Carrier installed in 1922
at
</P>
<P>
   Graumann's Metropolitan Theater in Los Angeles had to go.
</P>
<P>
   In its place came a heat pump, a bunch of fans and utility bills
</P>
<P>
   appropriate to a journalist's salary. They aren't newsworthy,
but
</P>
<P>
   they'll help us get by until the fall.

NETWORKS ARE TITULARLY CHALLENGED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It's bad enough that we're often left with
the gnawing feeling that most television shows are merely tinkered
versions of what we've seen before. With notable exceptions, we
wonder if Hollywood has run out of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have to wonder if television has even run out of titles.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring example is two new dramas, one for CBS, the
other for ABC. Both are arguably the best new offerings for the
networks.
</P>
<P>
   For CBS, it is ``Now and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   For ABC, ``Once and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   You might as well add MSNBC, which will continue to air ``Time &AMP;
Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply ran out of words,'' ABC entertainment president
Jamie Tarses joked of her industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is budging. Both CBS and NBC said the titles would stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously unfortunate the two shows have similar
titles,'' Tarses said. ``We are not changing our title. It bears no
resemblance to the other show at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not even that big a deal, Tarses said: ``It is shocking ...
about how little title recognition people have.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it will be difficult to have title recognition when
all the titles sound the same. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   There is ``Family Guy'' (Fox) and ``Family Law'' (CBS), not to
be confused with ``Martial Law'' (CBS), which is categorically
different from ``Law &AMP; Order'' or the new ``Law &AMP; Order: Special
Victims Unit'' (NBC).
</P>
<P>
   Moving on, Fox will have the one-hour ``Ally McBeal,'' and the
new half-hour ``Ally.'' Fox, which also airs two versions of
``Cops,'' has ``Malcolm in the Middle'' (mid-season) as opposed to
UPN's ``Malcolm &AMP; Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   There is ``Grown Ups'' (UPN) and ``Oh, Grow Up'' (ABC), ``The
Badland'' (ABC) and ``Wasteland'' (ABC), ``Third Watch'' and
``Third Rock'' (both NBC), and ``Angel'' (WB), ``Touched by an
Angel'' (CBS) and ``City of Angels,'' (CBS, mid-season), which is
different, of course, from ``Sex and the City'' (HBO) or ``Spin
City'' (ABC).
</P>
<P>
   ``Odd Man Out'' (ABC) is about a lone guy in a house full of
women, not to be confused with ``Ladies Man'' (CBS), which is about
... a lone guy in a house full of women. ``Ladies Man'' (which is
the annual entry in the grammatically incorrect show of the year _
there should be an apostrophe at the end) is also entirely
different from ``Ladies' Man,'' the Tim Meadows feature film in
production, or ``Ladies' Man,'' a 1980 CBS sitcom about ... a lone
guy surrounded by women.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ``The Downtowners,'' a new animated comedy from
the WB. The problem was it sounded too much like the new MTV show
``Downtown,'' so WB changed it to ``Mission Hill'' ... except now
it could get tangled with the animated ``King of the Hill'' (Fox),
but not ``Jack and Jill'' (WB).
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven Days'' (UPN), meet ``Seventh Heaven'' (WB). ``Sports
Night,'' (ABC), ``Tonight Show'' (NBC), ``Saturday Night Live,''
(NBC), ``Mad TV'' (Fox), ``Stark Raving Mad'' (NBC), four
``Datelines'' (NBC), four ``20/20s'' (ABC), a ``60 Minutes'' and
``60 Minutes II'' (CBS), ``West Wing'' (NBC), wrestling (every
other network) ... oh, God, make it stop.
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned ``Once and Again,'' from the makers of
``thirtysomething'' and ``My So-Called Life,'' has a good shot to
succeed _ if an audience first finds it, then is patient enough to
wait around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC drama about two divorced parents will premiere on
Tuesdays at 10 p.m. If that time slot sounds familiar, it should:
That is when ``NYPD Blue'' airs.
</P>
<P>
   ``NYPD Blue'' has an October start-up, so ABC plans to put the
new drama in its slot for a month, then re-introduce it on Monday
nights after ``Monday Night Football'' concludes its season.
</P>
<P>
   So will any audience gathered in the fall be willing to wait
through up to a three-month hiatus?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plans,'' Tarses said. ``It is our responsibility to
keep it alive through any and every means we have available to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a risky proposition at best. Last season the network's
best new drama, ``Cupid,'' died because scheduling exiled it to
Saturday night. ABC would be wrong to repeat slotting infanticide
again with what could be a strong show.

 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- More than 30 years after wrapping up one of the NBA's
greatest careers, Bill Russell allowed fans to really see, know,
and touch him for the first time at a recent FleetCenter tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rice, one of the most dominating hitters over a 12-year span
(1975-86), didn't soften his once-intimidating demeanor until
taking over as Red Sox hitting coach a few years ago, long after
his playing days were over.
</P>
<P>
   And now another great Boston athlete may be known _ or, more
correctly, not known _ for his reluctance in letting people into
his world. Patriots tight end Ben Coates, probably the NFL's best
of his era at his position, may never see his career fully
acknowledged because he has never been there to speak about it.
</P>
<P>
   But his words probably couldn't add much more to the
6-foot-5-inch, 245-pounder's resume of five Pro Bowl selections,
five straight years of catching 60 or more passes, and the power to
fight off what is usually double coverage to haul in Drew Bledsoe's
passes.
</P>
<P>
   His entire life has been quiet, even after Bobby Grier found
Coates at tiny Livingstone College in Salisbury, N.C., and watched
him turn into one of the NFL's best ``finds'' of this era. But few
athletes would have survived his 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, it was typical: 67 catches, once again Bledsoe's
go-to guy every time the quarterback couldn't find a receiver open.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, his life unraveled: forced to cope with the
deaths of his mother, aunt, and sister all within a five-month
span, while also standing up to a public trial over the alleged
assault of the mother of his child. Coates was eventually
acquitted, but in the meantime was a moral punching bag when it was
revealed how many children he was supporting out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   But Coates, as usual, was left standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family gave me a lot of support and we were all there for
each other,'' said Coates this week in a telephone interview from
his home in North Carolina. ``I wasn't the only one who went
through it. My whole family had to go through it. My wife and my
kids were there for me, and now we've moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not take part in the team's offseason conditioning
program, even though team officials asked him to be there.
Certainly, in the end, they understood that Coates needed time away
from everything.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he returns to Smithfield, R.I., this weekend for the start
of training camp, none of what happened a year ago will be in his
mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   He will never speak or think of it again, except for warm
memories of his mother, who died at age 56, his sister, Ann, who
was only 38, and an aunt whom he loved like a mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got away from it all and stayed home and hung around with
the wife and kids,'' said Coates. ``I tried to block everything out
and looked on this as a new year. I can't do anything to change
what happened. All I can do is look ahead to '99 and go on the
field and be the best player I can and improve on the things I've
done in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   How does a potential Hall of Famer improve? How could Ben Coates
possibly be tougher, smarter, better?
</P>
<P>
   ``My yards per catch was down (9.9 from 11.2 the previous
season). Maybe it didn't look like it,'' said Coates, ``but there
were times I didn't have 100 percent concentration because my mind
would start thinking about things that were going on. When I come
back, none of that will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   No, you would not have noticed any difference in Coates's play,
except for the game in St. Louis he missed to attend his mother's
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   He was still Bledsoe's savior when Terry Glenn, Vincent Brisby,
and Troy Brown were all out with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   While Coates took no bows in the media, he took them in the
locker room from an admiring group of teammates who appreciate
everything he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been around a man who is as classy as Ben Coates,''
said Shawn Jefferson. ``For what he does on the field and for how
he conducted himself when everything was falling apart in his
personal life, it was amazing to see the inner strength he has as a
person. If that didn't rub off on some people on this team, nothing
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Silent in good times and in bad, Coates said he has made a
conscious choice to keep to himself. This is the way he was raised
by his late mother _ never to boast about his accolades, to always
be humble, and to be strong in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   And, to be consistent.
</P>
<P>
   That's what his public image is. He is not surly or
disrespectful to anyone. Quite the contrary, when he sees a
familiar face he's always polite and says hello. But, usually, the
conversation ends quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I choose to be to myself,'' he said. ``When I'm playing, I'm
performing. And during the season I like to keep to myself because
I have my own way of preparing for the game. I have in mind a
routine that I follow and I have a way to prepare for the game. I
replay the game over and over in my mind. I think about different
situations and what I might do if something like that were to come
up. I build up to that. And when the game comes along I try and
execute what I've been thinking about all week.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Bledsoe, Ty Law, Glenn, and others get the attention while
he's just being Ben Coates, that is not a problem with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think about it,'' said Coates. ``This is the
player I am. If the accolades come, they come. Some athletes in my
position can get real selfish and say, `Oh well, I played great,'
and they get a little too cocky about themselves and never perform
at that level again.''
</P>
<P>
   But that will not happen to Coates. He plays hurt. He plays in
pain. And while he admits he's taken punishment over the years
because of all the double-teaming and dirty tactics used to defend
him, Coates says he doesn't feel old yet.

 BOSTON: ... old yet.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I admit I've taken a lot of punishment over the years. That's
why I wanted to come into camp lighter than usual. I think I was
about 245 or 250 last year, and I'd like to be around 240. I've
gotten into good shape for that reason,'' Coates said. ``The older
you get, the better-conditioned you have to be. If we can keep our
receivers healthy, it would help me out tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Some may think Coates is on the downside of his career, but he
doesn't agree, though acknowledging he needs more help from backup
tight end Rod Rutledge, with whom he's worked closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's better than in his rookie year,'' acknowledged Coates.
``Now he's going to have to come in and show that he can catch and
block. He can block, but his catching is suspect. He didn't catch
any balls last year and now that they've gotten rid of Lovett
Purnell, he's got to come in and be the second tight end. If I'm
double-teamed and he's open, he's got to show the ability to catch
the ball. But I really need the guys on the outside to be healthy.
That's what would help me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   And toward that end, Coates doesn't miss many opportunities to
bend Glenn's ear. They are locker neighbors, and Coates has been
urging Glenn to take care of his body so he can play a full season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to him,'' said Coates. ``Terry could go out and put it
all together this year. He's shown what he can do. If he can do
what he did as a rookie, that would make all of us have a better
year.''
</P>
<P>
   He appreciates the chance he's had to play with Bledsoe, whose
rifle arm enables Coates to see a lot more balls despite often
being caught in a sea of enemy shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works hand in hand,'' said Coates. ``Drew has helped my
career and I think I helped his career the first three or four
years. He's a little too overprotective sometimes. I tell him all
the time, `If you get into situations where you need to get me the
ball, I'll always be there for you.' Sometimes he looks for the
other receivers, but I'm always there. I think we know that we have
each other. He's there for me, and I'm there for him. What we'd
like is to get somebody else in there that Drew can rely on so it's
not always 87 and 11.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates thinks the Patriots can still get back to the level of
their Super Bowl team. He hasn't cringed as much as other veterans
at the loss of so many players from that team, feeling the younger
players the Patriots have gone with could do the job.
</P>
<P>
   But, he warns, ``We have to have a lot of the guys we drafted
two years ago step up and perform at a high level. I think the big
thing for them is that they can't be content to be backups anymore.
They have to start looking at the guys in front of them and start
taking their jobs. But I think we're definitely the caliber of team
that can get to the Super Bowl. I think these guys have had the
luxury of being able to sit, watch, and develop, but now it's time
for them to step out of that into starting roles.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's left for Coates to accomplish? In order: a Super Bowl
triumph, breaking Stanley Morgan's all-time Patriots' reception
record, and the Hall of Fame. To reach those goals, he will have to
play a few more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to play three or four more years after this year,''
said Coates, who turns 30 Aug. 16. ``I feel I'd still be a top
player and that I could take the punishment of the position for
that long.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he spoke to Morgan last year about his receiving record
of 534 catches (Coates enters the season with 458).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I could do it. It'll be tough, but if I have good
years I can make it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And to do that, he would have to remain a Patriot for the
forseeable future. He's currently in the second year of a
three-year deal that will pay him $2.1 million and $2.6 million the
next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the type of person where I'm going to let the contract run
out, said Coates. If they decide they want to re-sign me before
that, then they do. If not, the contract is not an issue. After
next year, who knows what the option might be?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to stay here the rest of my career. The quarterback
is there and there are a handful of guys I hang around with. I've
been through a lot with them and we like being together. But two
years from now? A lot can happen in two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The only place Coates might like to go other than Foxborough is
Canton, Ohio. That would finish off the story of the kid who came
out of a small, little-known school in the South to become one of
the best at his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get (to the Hall of Fame) because that's one place
that if I do get there, there won't be many others there,'' said
Coates. ``I think there are two others guys in the '90s _ Shannon
(Sharpe) and Keith Jackson _ who will be there. But who knows how
the voting will go?''
</P>
<P>
   He remains close to Sharpe, with whom he has had a running
competition to see who catches the most balls each year. Sharpe,
though, is not as pure a tight end as Coates, who is a better
blocker and better at catching the ball in crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I taunted him before he left for training camp,'' Coates said
with a laugh. ``I talk to him a lot in the offseason. It's fun.
We're friends off the field and we've always pushed each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, though, has pushed Coates more than himself. He hasn't
cared who the coach was, or what was going on around him, only that
he had to be the best. That part has remained as consistent as his
resolve to keep himself out of the spotlight and out of the media.
He wants none of that, until the day he gives his acceptance speech
in Canton.

   When America Online used to charge by the hour, chat was the
online service's big moneymaker. For all of its then-glitzy
graphics and specialty content, it was something very simple that
kept subscribers paying AOL's hourly rates.

game of cat and rat between AOL and Microsoft. It's a wonderful
battle of wills, a situation in which roles are reversed, and a
classic example of how the Internet really does change everything.
</P>
<P>
   First, some history is in order.
</P>
<P>
   For years, America Online has offered its users the ability to
send instant messages to one another. This is a simple, one-on-one
chat with another person, and it became one of AOL's most popular
features. You know a technological achievement is a hit when its
acronym becomes a verb, and AOL users began to urge their friends,
``Why don't you IM me?''
</P>
<P>
   The feature got a boost when AOL created Buddy Lists, which let
you see when your friends sign onto the service, and allowed users
to invite people on their lists into group chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AN AOL DEAL FOR NON-CLIENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This turned AOL into the virtual version of a town square _ or
maybe the correct analogy in the 1990s is the shopping mall. It was
like waving and saying, ``Hi, how are you?'' when you saw someone
you knew.
</P>
<P>
   The kicker came when AOL began offering a free version of its
instant-message feature to Internet users who didn't subscribe to
the online service. AOL Instant Messenger, which combined messaging
and the Buddy List feature into one simple application, was an
instant hit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, people who are not on AOL can communicate with their
friends who are, as well as anyone else on the Net who uses the
Instant Messenger software. Although it's free, there is an
advertising banner that appears atop the Buddy List, so AOL makes
money by selling that space.
</P>
<P>
   The company also builds what's known as mindshare _ it puts its
brand front-and-center on the desktop of people who don't normally
use AOL. They have a good feeling about the brand, because it gives
them something of value for free. It also gives AOL a certain
cachet _ after all, it's doing something cool for the online
community.
</P>
<P>
   AOL believes instant messaging is the next ``killer app''
online, according to Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape
Communications, which AOL bought this year. Andreessen recently
called it a ``tornado app'' at the PC Expo trade show, because the
more people use it, the more valuable it becomes, and the more
valuable it becomes, the more people use it. AOL recently put its
money where its vision is and bought Mirabilis, an Israeli company
that developed the popular, if overly complex, ICQ instant message
program.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MICROSOFT FIGHTS SHUTOUT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Enter Microsoft, the 900-pound gorilla of personal computing.
When a market develops to the point that Microsoft thinks it can
make money there, it moves in with a vengeance. And that's what it
did last week with its own instant messaging program.
</P>
<P>
   Tied to both its Microsoft Network and Hotmail Web e-mail
services, MSN Messenger could also talk to AOL's users. Both Yahoo
and Prodigy also recently released their own instant-message
clients, and they, too, could talk to AOL's users.
</P>
<P>
   This is not something AOL officials wanted. They tweaked the AOL
system so the newcomers couldn't get in. Both Prodigy and Yahoo
said fine, be that way. Not Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it was acting on behalf of Internet users who want to see
open standards applied to instant messaging, Microsoft issued a new
version of its software that got around AOL's block. Then, AOL shut
out the new version. Then, Microsoft's programmers hammered out a
fix. Then, AOL closed the door again. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   In public statements, both companies are trying to appear as the
good guy. Microsoft says it's fighting for an open Internet, where
everyone can chat with everyone else. America Online says Microsoft
is violating its users' privacy by enticing them to enter AOL
passwords into the MSN Messenger software.
</P>
<P>
   Both statements, of course, are full of beans.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft doesn't want an open Internet; it wants to seduce
market share from AOL's Instant Messenger. Although MSN Messenger
doesn't have advertising on it, it would be easy to add. And MSN
Messenger is closely tied to Hotmail _ it will alert you when
there's something new in your Hotmail inbox _ which does have
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, of course, wants to keep its users all to itself. If its
users switch to MSN Messenger, then they won't view AOL's
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The argument that AOL users are giving up privacy by using MSN
Messenger is nonsense. Microsoft says the passwords are only used
to connect to AOL's own servers, and Microsoft does not retain
them.
</P>
<P>
   AOL would have some merit in its argument that Microsoft's
actions amount to hacking into its server, except for the fact that
AOL at one point published on the Web the information necessary to
build an AOL Instant Messenger client. Several pieces of software,
mostly for Unix and Linux systems, were developed from this effort.
Doesn't this amount to an invitation to join the party?
</P>
<P>
   Looking in on Usenet discussion groups and various Web message
boards, it appears the Net is cheering on Microsoft in this case.
What an irony. Everyone's favorite bully is suddenly everyone's
favorite victim!
</P>
<P>
   So far, there's no end to the dispute in sight, though AOL has
sent Microsoft a letter asking for some kind of resolution. Here's
hoping AOL opens up its servers and lets Microsoft _ and everyone
else _ in to play. Instant messaging currently is balkanized, and
not until there's a single standard that lets everyone talk to each
other will its full capabilities be realized.

TWO DIFFERENT METHODS LET USER COPY OUTLOOK'S PERSONAL INFORMATION
FILES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Many folks, including myself, lose a hard drive from time to
time. We usually have backed all program data files onto a floppy
disk. There is one file that is not and that is the Microsoft
Outlook 98 ``Address/contact'' book. It is heck to rebuild. I am
using Windows 98. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 _ Microsoft's personal
information management programs _ store their info in folders with
a .PST extension. In theory, you could search your drive for these
files and make copies of them onto a floppy disk.
</P>
<P>
   But some of them may be way too big for a floppy, or may contain
information you don't want. It's actually better to use one of two
other methods for backing up your e-mail, contacts, to-do lists and
other items.
</P>
<P>
   If you have Outlook installed, there should be a Mail or Mail
and Fax icon in the Windows Control Panel. Launch it, and you'll
see a list of items that can be copied, including e-mail boxes and
personal folders (the latter likely will contain your contact
information).
</P>
<P>
   Click on the one you want to copy, and click the Properties
button. In the window that appears, you'll see the name of a folder
where that file is stored. Make a note of this folder. Click
Cancel, go back to the list of items, and click Copy to duplicate
the one you want.
</P>
<P>
   Use Explorer to get to the folder where it's stored and move the
copy to a floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   If it's too big for a floppy, go back to the Control Panel
module for Mail and open it. Click on the copy, choose Properties
again and choose Compact Now.
</P>
<P>
   This will compress the folder dramatically _ you should be able
to put it on a floppy.
</P>
<P>
   The other way is actually simpler, though you don't get the
option to compress.
</P>
<P>
   From within Outlook, go to the area you want to back up. Choose
File, then Import and Export. From here you have several choices,
including Export to a File. Choose that, and then you can decide
how you want to save the data.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you can export to other Office products, such as
Access or Excel, or to any spreadsheet that can read
comma-delineated text (where each field is separated by a comma).
In this case, choose to export to a Personal File Folder.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be asked which Outlook component to export. Choose the
one you want (click the Filter button to only export certain
fields), and click Next. You can then tell Outlook where to put the
PST file, such as on a floppy disk, if it will fit.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to be able to take my old vinyl LPs and convert them
to compact discs using a writeable CD-ROM drive I am about to buy.
But I have a question. How do I connect the turntable to my
computer?
</P>
<P>
   A: The best way to do this is to buy a device called a
preamplifier. You can get these at any electronics parts store.
Connect the turntable to the preamp, then the preamp to the line-in
jack on your computer's sound card.
</P>
<P>
   You may need to buy an adapter cable for the connection between
the preamp and the sound card.
</P>
<P>
   You will also need software that can handle the conversion.
Check out Easy CD Creator Deluxe 3.5 from Adaptec, which comes with
a component called SpinDoctor. It's specifically designed for
converting LPs to CDs. It also has some tips on how to handle the
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You once printed the address of a Web site that offers free
e-mail technical support. I've lost that article. Can you reprint
the address, please?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. It's NoWonder at www.nowonder.com. Ask a question about
your PC, and you're likely to get an answer back in hours.

INVESTORS ARE ON THE WAY TO AN $8.8 MILLION RETIREMENT NESTEGG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 1, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I are 34 and 32 years old respectively. Ever
since I quit my job to stay home with our two newborns, we have
been trying to determine if we are on our way to a comfortable
retirement. Currently my husband's new job gives us $78,000
annually. Before I quit my job, we made an average of $120,000 a
year. We have accumulated $186,000 in stocks, $21,000 in Janus
fund, $2,000 in Janus Olympus fund, and $4,500 in Vanguard Index
500. We have no credit card debt, owe $20,000 on a home equity line
(used to buy a car) and owe $170,000 on our home, which is
appraised at $250,000. Each year we are adding $2,000 to each of
our Roth IRAs (Vanguard and Janus Olympus) and my husband has just
started his 401(k), where we plan to invest the $10,000 maximum. On
average, we plan to save $25,000 a year through the Roth IRAs, the
401(k) and other savings. Will this be enough to retire
comfortably, and if not, how far off the mark are we?
</P>
<P>
   T.A., Yorba Linda, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. C'mon. You must know you will be in very good shape given
your aggressive savings habits. With a savings rate of $25,000 a
year, you would build your portfolio to a whopping $8,854,068 over
the course of 31 years, presuming 10 percent average annual
portfolio growth. That's more than double what you would need to
match your current life style, even after calculating in the
awesome effects of inflation. The math works this way: If inflation
averages 3.5 percent over the course of 31 years, you would require
$226,592 a year to buy the same goods and services that $78,000
buys today. But if you established a fixed-income portfolio that
brought you an average yield of 6.5 percent, you would need less
than half of your total portfolio to do the trick, leaving the
remainder in growth-oriented holdings to offset the effects of
later inflation on your retirement income stream.
</P>
<P>
   That is what I call sitting pretty.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me that the major thing for you to be thinking about
is taxes. Of your current savings, nearly 97 percent is in taxable
accounts. If you continue the savings program you outline, with
$14,000 a year going into tax-deferred or tax-free accounts (the
401(k) and the Roth IRAs) and with $11,000 going into taxable
savings, you would end up with $6,065,890 in the taxable accounts.
I know this probably doesn't seem to make sense at first blush, but
you should remember that it's the considerable nestegg you have
already accumulated that is the big factor in the projection. If
you simple stopped saving entirely, the projection would carry that
$213,500 to $4,097,991 over 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, I suggest that you look for tax-deferred instruments
for a good deal of that $11,000 annual savings that goes beyond the
401(k) and Roth IRA investments. You might also look to some
changes in your current holdings. For example, the people at Janus
tell me that the Janus Aspen Series Growth Portfolio variable
annuity substantially duplicates the portfolio of Janus fund. So
you might want to transfer some or all of your Janus fund holdings
to that instrument -- remembering, of course, that there will be
current-year tax implications of selling the Janus fund position to
buy the annuity.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you could work out a schedule of transfers over several
years which would minimize the current tax load.
</P>
<P>
   These are all fairly minor wrinkles -- you should be in great
shape, and the substantial amount of money you have already saved
at a relatively young age makes me feel it's likely you'll stick to
the program. (Sometimes, I confess, I am a little bit cynical about
the prospects of people in their mid-forties who propose to begin a
grand retirement savings program and ask for a projected
accumulation amount; if they've saved little or nothing by then,
the chances that they'll stay on track sometimes seem mighty
sketchy to me.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 40 years old and I received a $26,500 accident
settlement last year. I paid off my credit cards ands invested
$20,000 with Vanguard, putting $5,000 each in The Total Stock
Market Index, Extended Market Index, Index Value, and Index 500. I
add a further $100 each month through Vanguard's automatic
investment plan, with the money evenly divided among the four
funds. I am single and make $24,000 a year. I am a first-time
investor and have twenty years plus to go until retirement, so I
can be aggressive. What do you think of my portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   R.R., Encinitas, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. While these four funds seem like a fairly broad
diversification, when you look at their portfolios carefully,
you'll find a good deal of duplication of holdings and market
concentrations. Both Index 500 and Index Value focus on the
Standard and Poor's 500 Index of the nation's dominant companies,
with Index 500 tracking the entire 500 index and Index Value
focusing on a subset of the index, containing the stocks of the
companies with the lowest price to book value ratios.
</P>
<P>
   The Total Stock Market Index sounds as if it would be a
meaningful diversification, but while it tracks the nation's 5,000
leading public companies, it does with a market-cap weighting. For
example, the market value of all the shares of Microsoft Corp.
represents 3.39 percent of the market value of all of the 5,000
companies in the Wilshire 5000 index, and accordingly the Microsoft
position represents 3.39 percent of the portfolio of the fund. When
you combine this with the positions in the 300 or 400 other
companies that dominate the Standard and Poor's 500, there is very
little weight given to the small- and mid-cap stocks. The upshot of
all this is that this fund ends up in exactly the same category as
Vanguard Index 500 -- a large-cap blend of growth and value
oriented stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It's only with the Vanguard Extended Market fund, which tracks
the Wilshire 4500 Index, that you get a direct participation in the
small- and medium-cap markets, with the same kind of market-cap
weighting giving the fund an overall rating as a mid-cap blend
fund.
</P>
<P>
   If I were making such a portfolio, I'd be a little more direct,
perhaps putting $10,000 in the either Index 500 or Index Value (or
divided between the two as you have done), and then putting $5,000
each into Vanguard's Mid-Cap Index and its Small-Cap Index.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you don't mention the purpose for which you are saving,
but if it is retirement, I suggest you stash up $1,000 of those
ongoing contributions in a bank account -- enough for the minimum
initial investment in an IRA account -- and then open an IRA
account in Vanguard International Value fund. It's not an index
fund, but my suspicion is that in the volatile international stock
arena, a managed portfolio should have an advantage over an index
fund.

ROBERTS MAKES A WINNING `RUNAWAY BRIDE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
RUNAWAY BRIDE 
Directed by: Garry Marshall 
Screenplay by: Josann McGibbon, Sara Parriott 
Starring: Julia Roberts, Richard Gere, Joan Cusack, Hector
Elizondo, Rita Wilson, Paul Dooley, Christopher Meloni, Donal
Logue, Reg Rogers, Yul Vasquez 
Running time: 116 minutes 
Rated: PG (language and some suggestive dialogue) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big difference between ``Pretty Woman'' and ``Runaway
Bride'' is that this time Julia Roberts is a lot more confident and
Richard Gere is a lot more laid back. This alone makes ``Runaway
Bride'' far more likable than ``Pretty Woman,'' their huge 1990
hit, which only I seem to have regarded as sexist drivel dedicated
to what it would have us believe is the sunny side of prostitution.
``Runaway Bride'' is an altogether more entertaining factory
product, which is to say it's synthetic from the word go, but charm
and stardust carry it past its blatantly manufactured quality. If
not as witty as ``Notting Hill,'' teaming Roberts and Hugh Grant,
it nevertheless puts inventive spin on its formulas. Inventive
enough, at any rate, to turn them into a successful part two of
what may have begun as the Summer of Sam, but indisputably has
become the Summer of Julia.
</P>
<P>
   In a slightly different and more contrived way than ``Notting
Hill,'' ``Runaway Bride'' plays off Roberts's much-documented
skittishness, tailoring for her the role of a small-town Maryland
woman who keeps getting cold feet at the altar and bolting, a
process aided by her habit of wearing running shoes under her
wedding gown. Gere plays a throwback to the crumpled wiseguy
protagonists of the golden age of newspaper movies like ``Libeled
Lady.'' He begins as a USA Today columnist who loses his job when
he gets the facts wrong in writing about Roberts's marriage-shy
Maggie Carpenter after being spoon-fed the story in a bar. To get
his job back, he goes as a freelancer to her Eastern Shore town to
get the facts right via a self-vindicating feature story.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the film's allure emanates from the actual Maryland
Eastern Shore town of Berlin, where some of the scenes were shot.
It pleasantly reinforces the period flavor of the screwball comedy.
Maggie, who not only runs her family's hardware store but can fix
most of what's brought into it, isn't pleased to see him,
especially when he starts moving in on her relatives, her
neighbors, her friends, and even the high school football coach (a
very funny Christopher Meloni) who's about to give Maggie her
fourth shot at marriage. Roberts and Gere can only play the comedy
of antagonism for so long before the film is forced to bring them
together on the flimsy grounds that she can use the $1,000 he's
offering to pay her for an interview so she can buy her latest
wedding dress.
</P>
<P>
   One needn't be an oracle to predict what will happen once they
get together, although writers Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott
deserve credit for resourcefully avoiding what could have been
obnoxious levels of obviousness. At one point, when he takes her
for a drive and the car stalls, she knows exactly what's wrong with
it. And we always believe that the strength of her impulse to flee
is stronger than the attraction the story demands she feel toward
Gere's character. He's named Ike, by the way, a possible subliminal
trigger to the ``I like Ike'' Eisenhower generation. But it's not
really his film, it's hers. The smartest move this romantic comedy
makes is to downplay the romance, with its built-in credibility
problems, and emphasize the comedy.
</P>
<P>
   It works because Roberts's outsize features and outsize gestures
make her a natural comedian, a pretty obvious fact of which too few
of her films have taken advantage. She whoops and carries on here
with sunny exuberance, yet remains believably nervous about things,
big brown eyes darting to the edges of the frame as if looking for
an exit. In ``Pretty Woman'' she played a personality so squashed
that she needed Gere's preening high roller to tell her what
clothes to wear. Here, although she plays a stronger woman, she's
still tagged as neurotic, in need yet again of Gere's guru figure
leading her to wholeness. I'd have liked it more if the film had
held open the possibility that running from the men was a valid
choice, which it certainly seems to be, given their oafishness.
</P>
<P>
   The film also takes longer than necessary to get where we know
it's going. But it gives Roberts the launching pad she needs to
rocket into lovable goofiness and high-powered shyness. On the
agreeably relaxed Gere, a little humility looks good. There are
times when he looks relieved to have her carrying the film, as well
he might. Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn they're not, but they
deliver a smooth pas de deux here. Garry Marshall, who led them
through ``Pretty Woman,'' obviously established a positive work
vibe on the set. The film's big, open, simpatico energies are upped
by Joan Cusack's perfect sidekick to Maggie; Rita Wilson's tough
but humane editor who fires, then rehires Ike; and Hector Elizondo,
whose role as Wilson's husband and Ike's favorite photographer may
have been a reward for his performance in ``Pretty Woman.'' Roberts
has really hit her stride this summer, segueing from ``Notting
Hill'' to ``Runaway Bride'' without missing a step.

SLIM PICKIN'S: IF YOU TRY, YOU CAN DINE OUT AND EAT HEALTHY, TOO

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Dining out and scaling down are like caviar and hot
dogs _ they really don't mix.
</P>
<P>
   But gone are the days when moms can spend hours in the kitchen.
They're more likely to pick up a bucket of fried chicken at the
drive-through window.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, restaurant foods are often packed with more fat
than those prepared in homes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
says.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Americans are eating out twice as often as they did
three decades ago, according to a new U.S.D.A. survey. The study
also found that restaurant food accounted for 39 percent of U.S.
meals bought in 1996 _ up from 26 percent in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Pity the dieters.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing out of the fat trap isn't easy when eating at
restaurants is a habit. But don't throw up your hands yet, the
experts say. You can still frequent the little diner down the
street without acquiring an extra chinny-chin-chin. When eating in
restaurants is a way of life, you simply need a strategy to choose
what's healthy on the menu. No, this doesn't mean ordering a salad
and no dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Depriving yourself of the foods you like is never a good idea in
the long run, Houston nutritionist Linda McDonald says. Instead,
she recommends paying more attention to what you're ordering.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you can still have a good meal and a good time,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, once people walk into a restaurant, they think it's time
to indulge, the experts say. Who can blame them? They've had a long
day at work. And instead of eating a salad and entree, they go for
the works _ shrimp tart in a phyllo crust, artichoke heart salad,
Peking duck with spiced plum compote, licorice parfait with
espresso, and a glass of wine or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lose control,'' McDonald says.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, this is OK, but make it a habit and plan to add
a notch or two to your belt.
</P>
<P>
   To get control _ and to prevent the menu or chef from
controlling you _ here are some suggestions from diet and fitness
experts and individuals trying to stay in shape.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants have gotten into the mentality that bigger is
better. That may be all right for your wallet, but not your
waistline, McDonald says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where people get into trouble. They lick their plates
clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants often give double the portions. McDonald suggests
counteracting this by sharing an entree or taking half home.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't anything dancer Sally Rojas of the Houston Ballet
says she won't eat. The Venezuelan wife of restaurateur Chuck
Russell of Solero in downtown Houston has sampled culinary delights
ranging from fried beef tongue to boiled pig tripe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it, I've eaten it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In her line of business, maintaining a lithe figure is a must.
But that doesn't stop Rojas from indulging in her favorite dishes.
She simply cuts back on the portion size when she's eating
something high in fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much about portion,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Actress and diet guru Suzanne Somers takes another approach.
</P>
<P>
   Somers dines until she feels comfortably full, refusing to eat
past the point where some people keep stuffing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no counting fat grams, there's no counting calories,''
Somers, the author of ``Eat Great, Lose Weight'' (Crown Publishing,
$23) and ``Get Skinny On Fabulous Food'' (Crown Publishing, $24),
says.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing wisely is often half the battle. Stay away from
anything fried, advises Frank Messina, owner of the Ragin' Cajun
restaurant in southwest Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Messina has lost 60 pounds in the last six months, weight that
he had gained after frequenting too many restaurants, he says. The
restaurateur still eats out, but instead of ordering onion rings
and fried shrimp, he prefers nibbling on boiled shrimp, raw
oysters, green salads and chicken gumbo.
</P>
<P>
   When ordering, choose dishes that are steamed, poached, broiled,
roasted, grilled, baked or cooked in their own juices, says Patti
Ramsey, owner of Living Lean, a Houston company that offers
healthy, low-fat food.
</P>
<P>
   Eating on the run is Carol Isaak Barden's motto. The
contributing editor of Travel and Leisure magazine travels
frequently from one continent to the next. This means spending most
of her time in hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I'm very good, and others, I slide,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping her weight down hasn't been easy, but Barden has managed
through sheer determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing is the bread basket. I love it, but it goes
right to my rear,'' she says. ``I really would love to eat the
whole thing, but I kind of have to sit on myself and tell myself
that I'll pay for it later on the treadmill.''
</P>
<P>
   She also makes special requests, like asking for her fish to be
grilled without oil or the salad dressing on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those little things help,'' Barden says.
</P>
<P>
   Some people starve themselves before they eat out. Not a good
idea, McDonald says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you hungrier, and you'll end up eating more.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald recommends eating a light breakfast and lunch, instead.
She also suggests having a light snack an hour or two before going
to a restaurant, such as a glass of milk, cheese, crackers or
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the battle of the bulges, personal trainer Jason
Washington offers this simple advice: exercise.

<P>
   Controlling what you eat when you cook is one thing _ dining out
is another. Here are strategies and tips for nearly every
restaurant situation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mexican fare: Pass up the cheese enchiladas, chimichangas,
tacos and flautas, and opt, instead, for the fajitas and tacos al
carbon or soft burritos in nonfried flour tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   Think willpower when it comes to those nacho chips. Either ask
the server to take them away, or grab a handful and send the rest
away.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chinese food: Always ask the server that the food be prepared
with very little oil.
</P>
<P>
   Stay away from fried dishes, like sweet and sour pork or General
Tso's chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Request steamed rice instead of fried rice.
</P>
<P>
   Skip the egg rolls; go for the spring rolls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Italian delight: Pasta is good for you, but not when it's
loaded with Alfredo sauce. Go for tomato-based sauces, instead,
such as marinara.
</P>
<P>
   Ask for plain bread instead of garlic bread.
</P>
<P>
   _ Steakhouse know-hows: Pick leaner cuts, like sirloin, filet
mignon or tenderloin. Avoid prime cuts of beef, which taste yummy
but have the most fat.
</P>
<P>
   Request any visible fat to be removed before grilling the steak.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be tempted by the 22-ounce steak; all you need is a
3-ounce serving, about the size of the palm of your hand.
</P>
<P>
   If it comes with fries or onion rings, substitute a salad or
baked potato.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fast-food strategies: Order the grilled chicken instead of
hamburger or chicken nuggets. If you're craving the Cheddar
cheeseburger, have it _ but skip the fries.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a great deal, but resist the temptation to supersize.
No one needs the extra serving of fatty fries or high-sugar soft
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   _ A few more tidbits: Split dessert with a friend, or order a
sorbet, which is mostly ice and fruit flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid rich sauces, such as hollandaise, bearnaise and beurre
blanc.
</P>
<P>
   Ask if the restaurant offers half-portions.
</P>
<P>
   Just because it's soup doesn't mean it's low-fat. Fish chowders
and bisques are often made with whipping cream. Ask the server when
in doubt. In fact, make it a habit to ask the server how a dish is
prepared. &QL;

CULT REGROUPS, RETURNS TO BASICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Cult was last heard from in 1995 in Rio de Janeiro, where
singer Ian Astbury walked off the job from ``exhaustion.'' After 12
years of sometimes inspired music, sometimes hollow
experimentation, and a habit of making tabloid headlines, the Cult
appeared dead.
</P>
<P>
   The burial was premature, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Cult, which first rose from the tough streets of Brixton,
England, has risen again after regrouping at the Viper Room in Los
Angeles a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Minus a new album, the Cult is playing such favorites as the
incendiary ``She Sells Sanctuary,'' ``Revolution,'' and ``Sweet
Soul Sister.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy campers. We're really glad to be back,'' says
guitarist/attitude-setter Billy Duffy, whose stinging,
psychedelic-sonic-boom guitar sound has been cited as a bridge
between the Jimmy Pages and Mike McCreadys of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about rock 'n' roll now,'' says Duffy. ``It's lean,
and it's for real, and we mean it.
</P>
<P>
   He admits the Cult had veered from course before breaking up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of good-spirited musical invention, but we
were missing what we were about, which is rock 'n' roll in the
classic mold,'' says Duffy, speaking on a cell phone from the road.
``We were described as post-punk or early alternative or whatever,
but we were just following the people we loved _ Jimi Hendrix, Led
Zeppelin, Bad Company, Iggy Pop, the New York Dolls, and the
Stooges. That's the essence of the Cult.''
</P>
<P>
   That essence was rediscovered at the Viper Room. Duffy was on
stage with the Neurotic Outsiders _ an all-star band with a
revolving lineup that includes Billy Idol, John Taylor of Duran
Duran, and Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum of Guns N' Roses. Astbury
showed up and was invited on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the catalyst. It felt great right away,'' says Duffy.
``There was a lot of love in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   The new tour is an intimate, get-reacquainted session with
``hardcore Cult'' fans, says Duffy. And the group drummer Sorum
(who had been in the Cult in the late '80s and early '90s, before
joining Guns N' Roses) and Martyn LeNoble, who has played with
Porno for Pyros.
</P>
<P>
   While on hiatus, Duffy made an album with the band Colorsound
(also featuring Mike Peters of the Alarm) that is expected to come
out this fall, while Astbury traveled on a spiritual search to
Tibet and Nepal. But with the return of the Cult, look for a new
album next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be very visible next summer,'' says Duffy. ``Look for us
at rock barbecues and festivals near you.''
</P>
<P>

   More Woodstock: More horror stories are emerging about the mobs
of disgruntled youths that rioted as Woodstock '99 ended last
Sunday night at the former Griffiss Air Force base in Rome, N.Y.
The youths set fire to 12 tractor trailers (destroying all of
them), overturned a sound tower, burned a telephone truck in the
campground, and looted vendor tents and ATM machines. And if it
wasn't for the work of two bikers, Peter Wagner (a Vietnam War
veteran from Virginia) and Walter Jolley, a $250,000 Budweiser beer
truck also would have been looted. The bikers, who were friends of
the truck's owner, said they drove off the rampaging youths by
swinging 2-by-4s at them.
</P>
<P>
   Other eyewitness accounts:
</P>
<P>
   --From Erika Scott, 21, of Allston, Mass., who spent a harrowing
last night in the campground as the fires raged: ``My friend and I
were afraid we would be burned alive in our tent by half-naked men
who had gone insane, so we ran to the road and sat sleepless and
scared on the asphalt until the morning came . . . The hooting and
hollering of men, moved by anger, raging with testosterone. Men,
from ages 13 to 30 howling under the not-quite-full moon, tossed
trash and anything else into the flames. . . . (The fire was) maybe
20 feet in diameter and twice as high, I had never been that close
to a fire so large. . . . Vending carts had been tossed into the
flame, as were tables, chairs, and trash cans. As we stood there,
three men pushed down a toilet, crouched behind it and ran it
straight into the fire. It had a tribal feeling to it _ very
reminiscent of `Lord of the Flies.' ''
</P>
<P>
   --From Haddim Scott Kime, 27, a Berklee College of Music
student: ``I was back near the sound tower that got tipped over.
The kids tore off the walls around it and made a bonfire of that. .
. . In the campground, you'd see people burning tents. There was a
spirit of anarchy and one guy ran through the crowd saying,
`Anarchy reigns tonight!' It was younger kids doing it _ and all
males. I didn't see any women doing it. It was males screaming to
be heard. . . . It looked like drunken college kids in shorts and
ball caps. I didn't see any of the stoners or hippies doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spinning the '90s: Nirvana's ``Nevermind'' is Spin's No. 1 album
of the '90s, anticipating what is sure to be many similar lists in
these millennially obsessed times. Spin editors voted the ``90
greatest albums'' of the '90s for the September issue. It makes for
great reading, even if you don't always concur with the choices
(what, did you expect Bruce Springsteen or the Stones to be on an
alt-rock-tilted Spin list?). Rounding out Spin's top 10: Public
Enemy, ``Fear of a Black Planet''; PJ Harvey, ``To Bring You My
Love''; Beck, ``Odelay''; Pavement, ``Slanted and Enchanted'';
Hole, ``Live Through This''; Bjork, ``Post''; Dr. Dre, ``The
Chronic''; Radiohead, ``OK Computer''; and Chemical Brothers, ``Dig
Your Own Hole.'' The two most questionable calls were dropping U2's
``Achtung Baby'' to No. 19 and Pearl Jam's ``Ten'' to No. 35. That
Pearl Jam disc should be in the Top 3. A personal opinion.

WHEN ACCOUNTANTS, XXX FILMS COLLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Metro Global Media Inc., a very small public company in an
unsavory business, moved a step up the financial food chain in May
when it hired accountants from the Boston office of squeaky-clean
Grant Thornton to serve as its auditors.
</P>
<P>
   But Grant Thornton dropped the international adult entertainment
empire based in Cranston, R.I., like a hot potato just a month
later. And it wasn't because of the accountants suddenly discovered
the company's product inventory, including film titles like Taboo
17, Nothing to Hide, and Red Vibe Diaries.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason: Grant Thornton said it discovered that founder
and former president Kenneth Guarino, a minority shareholder with
alleged ties to organized crime and a previous pornography
conviction, was actually calling the shots from the background at
Metro Global Media.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of recent filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Grant Thornton said it learned of Guarino's operating
and financial decision-making authority after it signed on with
Metro Global Media, one of the few publicly traded adult
entertainment companies.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting firm said that based on ``supplemental due
diligence,'' it decided it was ``unwilling to be associated with
the company's financial statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Thornton sent a written response to our questions
Thursday, saying only that ``we value the privacy of our clients,
both current and past. As a rule, we refer all inquiries regarding
work performed for our clients back to the client.''
</P>
<P>
   A question you might ask (we did): What did Grant Thornton think
it was getting involved with in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   In the SEC filings, Metro Global Media disputed claims that
Guarino was making decisions. It said the power rested exclusively
with the company's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't agree with what they had to say,'' said Janet Hoey,
the treasurer at Metro Global Media. ``It was a huge surprise to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoey said she was fielding our call because Metro Global Media
president Dan Eberly left the job a month ago, a development that
did not appear to be publicly announced. That would have been about
the time Grant Thornton resigned the company's account.
</P>
<P>
   Hoey declined to discuss the circumstances of Eberly's departure
and said she was unaware why it had not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Guarino, who could not be reached for comment, has gotten a lot
out of his career in pornography. He bought a 9,000-square-foot
Beverly Hills house for $5 million from the Sultan of Brunei
earlier this year, according to the Los Angeles Times. Metro Global
Media recently said that it was moving its corporate headquarters
to a Los Angeles suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Guarino appears on paper to have a relatively small stock
holding in Metro Global Media. A limited partnership based in
Bermuda, Briana Investments, owns more than 20 percent of the
company, according to SEC reports.
</P>
<P>
   Guarino has bobbed in and out of the picture as a public figure
affilated with Metro Global Media for years. He stepped down as
president the first time in 1994, when a Wall Street Journal
article drew attention to his role at the company, which was known
at the time as South Pointe Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Guarino returned in December 1995 but resigned again for
``personal reasons'' in late 1996, when he was originally scheduled
to plead guilty in Las Vegas to a federal conspiracy charge.
</P>
<P>
   That event was delayed, but Guarino pleaded guilty in January
1997. A plea agreement detailed a decade of ``tribute'' payments of
$16,000 to $20,000 monthly made to Natale ``Chris'' Richichi, a
top-ranking member of the Gambino crime family according to press
reports, in return for the protection of his business ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Global Media has expanded from a small local operation
years ago to a global business selling X-rated films, magazines,
and sexually-oriented products. Not surprisingly, it has made a big
push onto the Internet with new sites like its ``amazingsex.com.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's revenues, which remained very modest and stagnant
for years, began to increase sharply in 1996. Sales in its most
recent reported quarter nearly doubled from year-ago levels to
$10.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   A $10 million licensing deal announced this week will permit New
Frontier Media Inc. to distribute Metro Global Media's library of
more than 3,000 films and videos, and millions of archived still
photos, over cable television and satellite networks.
</P>
<P>
   For all its expansion in adult entertainment fields, Metro
Global Media made a significant deal last year to diversify its
products. It purchased Fanzine International, a publisher of
mainstream special interest magazines like Teen Celebrity and Gym.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fanzine has performed well, generating nearly 40 percent
of Metro Global Media's revenues in the most recent quarter, the
results have done little to boost the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Metro Global Media said it was considering
plans to spin off the Fanzine operation or make some other
arrangement to win more stock market recognition for the business.
</P>
<P>
   Hoey agreed the switch from relatively unknown auditors to Grant
Thornton was motivated in part to the credibility it would lend to
any spinout or other stock market strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And now? ``We're still looking at all our options at this
time,'' Hoey said.

   BOSTON -- There is no guarantee Donnie Sadler will be the second
baseman when the Red Sox meet the Yankees Friday night in the
opener of a six-game homestand that features three games against
the iron of the American League East and three more against the
Cleveland Indians, the iron of the American League Central.
</P>
<P>
   Even after benching his All-Star second baseman, Jose Offerman,
for the last three games and summoning him into his office to tell
him his defense wasn't cutting it, manager Jimy Williams reserved
the right to change his mind at a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a player has to sit a day or two, whatever, that's what I'm
going to do,'' Williams said after meeting with Offerman. ``One
thing I've said, I can't please players all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things don't always go (straight). Sometimes there's a detour,
a bump on the highway, and then you hope you go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But given that Offerman is hitting .219 in his last 55 games and
his defense didn't suddenly take a dramatic upturn just from taking
some extra ground balls from coach Wendell Kim, chances are that
the rookie, Sadler, will be logging the majority of playing time on
the homestand, and perhaps much longer.
</P>
<P>
   This, after spending the entire season playing shortstop for
Triple A Pawtucket. ``I can't even remember the last time I played
second base,'' Sadler said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this wasn't the plan back in March, when the Sox hoped
Jeff Frye was fully recovered from knee surgery and general manager
Dan Duquette, who signed Offerman to a four-year, $26 million deal
last December, thought that Offerman's potent bat would more than
compensate for any deficiencies he had with the glove.
</P>
<P>
   But Frye lost his job three weeks into the season, then hurt his
knee again, and Offerman not only stopped hitting, but wore down
Williams's patience with his ineffectiveness in turning a double
play and reaching balls hit to his left.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Sadler, who probably would have arrived here sooner if he
hadn't developed tendinitis in his throwing shoulder. Lou Merloni,
who now looks as if he's living on borrowed time, was given the
summons instead, but after spending some time on rehab assignment
in Fort Myers, Fla., Sadler says he is fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``For awhile, I couldn't get anything on the ball,'' he said,
``so I shut it down for three weeks. I went down to Florida and it
started to feel good. I had a lot of treatment _ ultrasound,
massage, stretching _ and it helped me get back pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, who hit .291 in 43 games for the PawSox, said he hoped
he'd get some playing time when he was summoned by the Red Sox to
Toronto Tuesday, but acknowledged he was caught by surprise by
Williams upon his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy asked me if I was ready,'' Sadler said. ``I said yes, and
he said I was in there that night. I said, `Let's go.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It really helped my confidence out, that he had that kind of
faith in me, especially with things this tight in the wild- card
race, that he told me to get out there and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler was charged with two errors in his first game back, but
the first may have been the result of overeagerness, and the second
probably shouldn't have been ruled an error at all. Sadler ranged
far to his left to glove a ground ball to the right side, but when
he spun and threw to second base for an attempted force, the ball
bounced past shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. The second came when
Willie Greene hit a one-hop rocket that hit off Sadler's glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``It broke my glove,'' Sadler said. ``Snapped a string in two in
the webbing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sadler also doubled and scored on his first at-bat, beat out
an infield hit on his last, and also began two key double plays.
``He made the plays at the right time,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Wednesday night, Sadler made a terrific belly-flopping,
rug-hugging catch of Carlos Delgado's line drive, then flashed his
speed, the best in the organization, scoring from first on Trot
Nixon's double to the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   It's why Williams refers to him as a ``scatback.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, who started 38 games at second base last year when
Williams had to mix and match second basemen because of injuries to
Frye and Mark Lemke, is making no predictions about how long he'll
stick this time. But at 24, it is becoming increasingly clear that
his time has come, even if a $26 million player like Offerman
doesn't figure to remain on the bench for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping I can stay with the team,'' Sadler said, ``but
right now I'm taking it one day at a time. I'm just coming in
prepared to play every day.''

DEPLETED REVOLUTION COULD USE A SPARK

<P>
   There was never a grand plan with a professional soccer career
as the goal. If anything, Chaka Daley presumed the current A-League
season would be a farewell tour. The 25-year-old defender had
prepared for early retirement from competitive soccer and hoped to
make a graceful transition to college coach and businessman.
</P>
<P>
   But two exhibition games with the New England Revolution led to
a mid-June free agent signing. Daley's skills and 6-foot-2-inch,
185-pound frame caught the attention of goalkeeper/coach Walter
Zenga. And it appears the former Providence College star may be in
the right place at the right time. As Zenga struggles to find the
right combination on defense with central back Dan Calichman
injured, Daley has the opportunity to see more playing time
Saturday against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really played much yet, but I'm just being patient
and waiting for my time. If I'm called on, I'm going to make sure
I'm ready,'' said Daley. ``I think he liked my height and my being
athletic at my height. I think I have pretty good feet and that
helps me out a little bit. I'm competitive. I try to be aggressive
and compete all over the field. As a defender, all you have to do
is defend and give it to the good guys _ the Joe-Max (Moores) and
John Harkeses _ and let them sort it out.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Revolution take on the Mutiny, New England will be
without forward Moore and midfielder Harkes, who are with the US
national team for the Confederations Cup. Despite just one
appearance for New England, as a substitute in a 3-2 win over the
New York/New Jersey MetroStars July 4, Daley knows he must be
prepared to raise the level of his game if called upon by the
depleted squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the guys that come off the bench like Chaka or anyone
else need to step up,'' said Ted Chronopoulos. ``If they step up
into their roles, then they prove to the coach that they can play
on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition from the Boston Bulldogs to the Revolution has
forced Daley to be faster and sharper on the field. He is also
adjusting to the more technical play of Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely know I can stay up here and play,'' said Daley.
``I just have to be patient and pay my dues and see what happens
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley is close to earning a master's degree in business, but
will wait before he enters the boardroom. For now, the original
plans have been scrapped in favor of a soccer career.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from a strained right hip flexor, Dan Calichman has
shown improvement over the past few days. He practiced Thursday for
a half-hour and did short sprints along the sideline at Babson
College. Then he left for a pool workout. The Revolution's other
key injured player, Giovanni Savarese, has also shown improvement.
He tested the Grade 1 sprain of his right medial collateral
ligament with running and stretching. Both players will travel to
Tampa and take a fitness test prior to the game to determine if
they are ready . . . Forward Ariel Graziani spent the day in Mexico
finalizing paperwork for his visa. He was scheduled to meet the
team Friday in Tampa . . . Salvadoran national player Elias Montes
trained with the Revolution Thursday.

SARAH MCLACHLAN'S NEXT MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The official subtitle is ``A Celebration of Women in Music.''
But Lilith Fair, now in its third and final lap around the country,
has been called a few other things, among them a patchouli-scented
clubhouse for girls, a pseudo-feminist blight on the women's
movement, and a narrow, unadventurous slice of musical pie.
Lilith's founder, singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan, cheerfully
defuses all critical bombs tossed her way with the same sort of
gently articulate turns of phrase that characterize her songs. ``It
was a simple, selfish one,'' McLachlan says, when asked about her
original agenda for Lilith Fair, which rolls into the Tweeter
Center Tuesday. ``I wanted to meet all the women I like to listen
to and hear them play live.''
</P>
<P>
   A Lilith-style sentiment, indeed. But McLachlan was also mad as
hell (a not-so-Lilith-style sentiment; more on that later), and she
wasn't going to take it anymore. Speaking on a cell phone from the
Austin, Texas, concert site, McLachlan is drying off after a sudden
downpour and reflecting on the music festival that _ whatever else
you want to say about it _ has rewritten the rules of the road for
women. One of the top-grossing tours of the decade, Lilith Fair has
shattered the myth that female artists aren't moneymakers when it
comes to live concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lilith has effected change,'' McLachlan says with pride. ``I
think its helped to change the attitude of the industry. Its almost
gone the other direction. There's such an incredible amount of
female musicians out there. Guess who's having a really hard time?
Guess who's really ghettoized right now? The pendulum swings.''
McLachlan's pointed remarks aren't directed at male artists, but
rather the male-controlled music industry, which has historically
marginalized women for their ostensible lack of drawing power.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, as McLachlan was preparing to tour behind her
double-platinum album ``Fumbling Toward Ecstasy,'' she encountered
strong resistance from concert promoters to her request that Paula
Cole sign on as opening act. A female double bill, McLachlan was
told, was bad business. ``Yes, there was this big reactionary
element,'' McLachlan recalls. ``Being told I can't do something
makes me want to do it. For years the industry has underestimated
fans, and the music they want to listen to.'' Outraged, McLachlan
dreamed up Lilith Fair, an all-women lineup that shocked the
industry by pulling in more than $16 million its first year,
outselling testosterone-fueled goliaths like H.O.R.D.E. and
Lollapalooza.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the positive changes she and Lilith have wrought,
McLachlan has come under fire. By organizing a festival that clumps
women together, some have wondered, doesn't that furthur ghettoize
them? McLachlan, no stranger to this hypothesis, treads cautiously.
``It depends on where it's coming from. I've spoken so openly and
honestly about my idea of celebrating the diversity of women. I
think it really depends on the ideals behind it. If I was a man
doing it, it would be something that could be a topic of
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on McLachlan considered opening the Lilith Fair to men,
but she was talked out of it by one of her musical idols. ``There
was this continual onslaught from the media,'' McLachlan says. ``
`Why do you hate men?' I got beaten down. I thought maybe I should
make it egalitarian. But Emmylou Harris took me aside and said,
`You've started a beautiful thing. Let it grow.' I was so thankful
to her. From that point on I said `no. No men.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, a rotating lineup of 150 women grace the Lilith
stages. Boston's Main Stage performers are McLachlan, Sheryl Crow,
the Pretenders, Mya, and Me'Shell Ndegeocello. The B Stage features
Aimee Mann, Kendall Payne, and Lamb; local talent search winner
Lori McKenna, along with Bertine and Nina Gordon play the Village
Stage. Although the stylistic cross section has grown broader each
year, the emphasis continues to be on comfortable, mainstream pop
and rock. Where's the fire, and the edge? Where's the urban
element? Where is the healthy share of diversity that McLachlan
says she set out to celebrate? ``All I can say is we asked
everybody, from lots of different kinds of music, and the people
who said yes are on the tour,'' says McLachlan, clearly weary of
defending herself. ``I ask Courtney Love and Garbage every year.
Hole finally said yes, then they said no a week later. Something
about a scheduling conflict,'' she says, sounding doubtful. ``I
think they would have known about that earlier. It would have been
good for her and good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   She goes on to point out that people don't seem to register what
they're hearing on the smaller stages, where she says ``there's
some really hard stuff.'' You wouldn't know it from the Boston
lineup, though, which prompts McLachlan to note that each city gets
a different (and not necessarily representative) lineup _ based on
individual artists' availability. ``Ohio might not get the urban
artists,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one thing everyone seems to agree on, it's that
McLachlan has thrown her heart and soul into Lilith Fair. She
oversees every aspect of the project, and works tirelessly to
ensure that everything _ from the music to the on-site village to
the crew to the involvement of many charitable organizations Lilith
supports _ runs smoothly. It's been hard labor, she says _ trying
to make the festival bigger and better every year _ but one of
love, and McLachlan has mixed feelings about saying farewell to
Lilith Fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I'm ambivalent,'' she says, ``especially when I'm out
here having a fantastic day. But there are moments when (things go
wrong) and I'm like, `thank God.' But we had always had a
three-year plan, from the beginning. Of course no one else ever
talked about it or listened to me,'' she says laughing. ``In
January, we reassessed, and at that point we felt it was right. We
want to end on a high note. And a lot of us are kind of at a
crossroads. For me, it's Lilith or children. I can't do both.''
</P>
<P>
   After this summer's tour, McLachlan plans to take at least a
year off to travel for leisure, she says, and start a family.
She'll keep writing, and if an offer to do a song for film comes
along, she'll consider it. What will she least miss about Lilith
Fair? ``The press conferences!'' she practically shouts. ``That's
the worst part. It just (angers) me when you have the creme de la
creme of women in music and the media gawk like a bevy of monkeys.
`Come on,' I want to say, `ask us a question. We're so nice!' ''
</P>
<P>
   But McLachlan walks away with more than a mixed bag of memories.
She gushes about a musical education that, she says, she couldn't
have gotten anywhere but the Lilith Fair. ``Getting to sing with
Emmylou, Bonnie Raitt, the Indigo Girls, Sheryl Crow, Chrissie
Hynde, Sinead O'Connor, Queen Latifah,'' McLachlan says, ``that's
the best. And to get to hear the Village Stage artists, who are so
fresh and excited . . . it's a constant affirmation. That's the
essence of it.''

BAY STATE REGULATORS ACCUSED ALL-TECH OF WRONGDOING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- All-Tech Investment Group Inc., based in the northern
New Jersey town of Montvale, has clashed with Massachusetts
securities regulators, who shut down the company's Watertown office
this year, charging abuses including forgery and deceptive
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In an administrative complaint filed in December, the state
securities division accused All-Tech, whose Atlanta branch was a
site of shootings that eventually are believed to have killed nine
people, of conveying ``the impression that investors are likely to
achieve profits,'' while minimizing the risks of day trading.
</P>
<P>
   All-Tech officials also allegedly forged clients' signatures and
co-mingled client funds, according to the complaint. Some clients
allegedly lost tens of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Lashing out at the regulators at the time, All-Tech's chairman
and chief executive, Harvey Houtkin, who has called himself the
``father of electronic day trading,'' said the charges were
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are looking to put themselves on the map, and they are
doing it with day trading,'' he said in an interview. ``What they
have charged is nothing short of lunacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But in May the firm settled with the state, agreeing to close
the Watertown office for two years and pay $278,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``With one possible exception, that was our biggest day- trading
case,'' said Matthew Nestor, the state's director of securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deceptive marketing is the lynchpin of all this stuff. We
won't tolerate false claims about income. Day trading is a very
risky business, and any claim to the contrary is simply wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Day trading, which gets its name from the practice of holding
stocks for less than a day, has become big business across the
country. About a half-dozen firms like All-Tech have sprung up to
cater to a growing number of amateur investors who trade huge
blocks of stock, in transactions that often last only seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated traders work in boutiques such as All-Tech eight hours
a day, five days a week, often performing hundreds of trades a day
in pursuit of profits on minuscule movements in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Many are young men who have little investment experience,
regulators and industry insiders have said. Rather, they rely on
quick reaction times to dart in and out of the market. Some traders
say they get into a ``zone,'' in which information about stock
movements flashing on their computer screens is almost
instantaneously translated to keystrokes, ordering up blocks of
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators, particularly in Massachusetts, have taken a dim view
of the practice, saying it is little better than gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Many inexperienced traders hoping to tap a vein of stock market
riches have instead found themselves buried in debt after months of
nonstop trading, regulators say.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, day trading firms collect large commissions on stock
transactions whether traders make money or lose it, regulators say.
According to estimates by a consortium of state agencies, only two
in 10 professional day traders make money, and only a small number
of those make large returns.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred in part by Massachusetts regulators, the federal
Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of
Securities Dealers, and key members of Congress have sounded
warnings about the risks of day trading.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the NASD approved a rule requiring firms that promote
day-trading strategies to disclose to customers _ before they open
accounts _ the risks associated with that type of trading. The
risks include the loss of their entire investment. Those using
borrowed money to trade could lose that as well, the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   With 22 offices in 15 states and about 1,500 active trading
accounts, All-Tech is among the largest US day-trading chains. In
addition to the Massachusetts action, Oregon regulators conducted
an investigation of the company's practices in that state but never
brought charges.

OVERTIME MEANS EXTRA PROBLEMS FOR HARRIED WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; After a day care center slapped her with a $50 late fee for
not picking up her child on time, telephone service representative
Cheryl Charette sought a transfer to another office, an hour
farther from home, to escape the mandatory overtime that made her
late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to work where there is less stress, and I won't be
treated differently if . . . I have to leave work early to pick up
a sick child,'' said the 38-year-old mother of twins.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to hire enough employees in a tight New England labor
market, service centers operated by Bell Atlantic Corp. in Andover,
Mass. and by AT&AMP;T Corp. in Fairhaven, Mass. are invoking clauses in
their collective bargaining agreements that require overtime from
their employees.
</P>
<P>
   And the employees _ mostly women who, according to labor
statistics, are already working longer hours in general _ are at
wit's end as they try to balance their work and home lives with no
safety valve in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice, they say, they value time over the money that
overtime offers them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what I'm going to do,'' said Monique Samagaio,
34, who fears she will have to quit her job taking customer orders
at the AT&AMP;T call center in Fairhaven if she can't find someone to
stay with her children until she gets home at 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Samagaio, who has been working part time since spring, wants to
go full time but can't because she cannot find a baby sitter who
can both take care of a toddler, 2 1/2, and an 11-month-old baby
and assist her elderly parents, whose health is failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come the end of August, if I cannot get an extension (of her
part-time status), I am going to have to quit,'' she said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Both AT&AMP;T and Bell Atlantic say they appreciate the plight of
their employees and want to hire more people to reduce overtime
hours.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokeswoman Terri Cohen said the firm's current need for
overtime hours was triggered last spring by an increased volume of
calls. She said the measure is temporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is not to have people work overtime all the time,''
said Cohen. ``Our goal is to hire enough workers so that we can
handle the high volume of calls we are receiving. In the meantime,
we need (employees to work overtime) so that we can maintain a high
quality of service.''
</P>
<P>
   State and federal laws allow companies to require employees to
put in overtime as long as they are paid 1 1/2 times their regular
rate of pay after 40 hours of work. Unions, however, can negotiate
a limit to the number of overtime hours.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's contract with Communications Workers of America
Local 1400 specified employees at the Andover site be limited to a
maximum of 12 hours overtime per week five months of the year, and
10 hours a week for another six months. Local vice president Debbie
McCarthy said workers must be notified by 1 p.m. the previous day
if they are to work extended hours.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, many workers believe a day's notice offers too
little time to find day care substitutes or make other personal
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T's Fairhaven facility, the company said the number of
required overtime hours has dropped to 7 per week from 10 hours in
recent weeks, and the number of employees affected has decreased to
700 from 800. Another 200 employees are exempt from working
overtime for medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic acknowledged its mostly female service staff in
Andover is required to work extra hours, but spokesman Jack Hoey
maintained that the company's workers logged, on average, 3 1/2
hours of overtime per week in July.
</P>
<P>
   Both AT&AMP;T and Bell Atlantic, like other companies around the
country with similar policies, cite historically low unemployment,
increased demand for products and services, and an ongoing shortage
of skilled employees.
</P>
<P>
   Hoey said Bell Atlantic has hired 400 new employees, but half
are still in a 15-week training program. ``There is no question
that this is a tight labor market,'' Hoey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, we have customers who are installing second
and third lines and there is greater demand across the board, which
is all linked to the economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For both women and men in all lines of work, the average work
week has been getting longer in recent years. A report this year by
the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University
found that working mothers' hours in New England rose 15 percent
between 1983 and 1997, from 1,397 per year to 1,608.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty big increase, and it means that for many
working women the pressure is on,'' Paul Harrington, associate
director of the center, said. For married mothers, the jump was
bigger, to 1,590 hours from 1,336. Their husbands worked long hours
too, as much as 2,333 hours per year, an increase of 162 hours
annually, Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Morin, president of CWA Local 1400, said overtime
demands at Bell Atlantic shot up shortly after the company mailed
140,000 pieces of mail to the wrong customers, prompting an
onslaught of calls.
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T in Fairhaven, the union contends, the company failed to
hire enough people to deal with a surge in business.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic spokesman Hoey said guidelines developed by the
company and the union ``have provisions for managers to excuse
employees under certain circumstances. On a daily basis, management
has excused numerous employees from overtime requirements. We are
cognizant our employees have families.''
</P>
<P>
   Charette, the mother of 6-year-old twins who will transfer next
week from Andover to a Bell Atlantic site in Boston, says that even
a normal work day can be stressful, and a request to work an extra
half-hour upsets her entire family's life.
</P>
<P>
   Her new hours in Boston will be 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and the work
rarely involves overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Gaudreau, 39, of Fairhaven, who works at the AT&AMP;T call
center there, wishes she could choose her own hours, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like being told on Wednesday what my hours will be the
next day, next week. You do overtime when the company needs you.
It's hard to run a family life or any kind of life. . . . I'm
always missing opportunities to take my kids to sports activities
or summer activities. They take care of themselves when I'm not
around. Do I worry? Of course I do. What mother wouldn't?''

NEW PERSPECTIVE ON SOX-YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Weisman is considered one of the best television
producers of baseball games in the business.
</P>
<P>
   He proved it during the recent All-Star Game at Fenway Park,
when he blended a little Hollywood, a little technological
wizardry, and a lot of emotion, generated mainly by Ted Williams,
to produce one of the finest telecasts in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman is back in Boston this weekend to work the Yankees-Red
Sox series. With all of the history between the teams _ the 1976
brawl and Bucky Dent's homer to name just two famous episodes _
Weisman plans to recap the memorable moments and the Curse of the
Bambino as a buildup to, drumroll please, five-time Cy Young Award
winner Roger Clemens pitching against the Red Sox in pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   It was one thing for Clemens to play for the Blue Jays, but the
Yankees? At Fenway?
</P>
<P>
   Now another producer might jam all sorts of graphics and video
clips to milk Clemens's return to Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Not Weisman.
</P>
<P>
   He said he probably will turn up the microphones in the stands
to let the Fenway faithful do all the talking. Weisman also said he
might split the screen to show viewers the reaction from the crowd
and the reaction on Clemens's face.
</P>
<P>
   Deserved or not, boos are expected and will be on Channel 25
starting at 1:30 p.m.

   Celtics close to rights deal
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are about three weeks away from signing a television
deal with Fox Sports New England and Channel 38.
</P>
<P>
   The parties are in the final stages of negotiations to give the
team an over-the-air partner after the departure of Channel 68,
which Pax recently bought from Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Pax, a family-oriented station, had no interest in keeping the
Celtics' road games, which Channel 68 carried last season in an
unusual arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics and Channel 68 agreed to split advertising revenue,
share production costs, and deal with the rights fee over time. The
station would make money after a certain point.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 38 carried the games before the Celtics accepted the
three-year deal with Channel 68. Two years ago, Channel 38 paid an
estimated $100,000 for every road game covered (about $4 million
per year). The station also carries Bruins games and didn't press
hard to keep the Celtics package. Unconvinced that sports teams
would generate profits, station officials opted to pick up
syndicated shows.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Fox Sports New England offered the Celtics a
lucrative 10-year deal, but the team balked at having the majority
of their games on cable.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   A first for Mortensen
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's Chris Mortensen gets the scoop award for breaking the
story on Barry Sanders's retirement. ESPN interrupted its
``Baseball Tonight'' program at 10:06 Tuesday night to inform
viewers that Sanders was leaving the Detroit Lions . . . ESPN's
``Monday Night Countdown'' expands to a two-hour format and debuts
Sept. 13 at 7. Mike Tirico is host with Tom Jackson, Ron Jaworski,
Sterling Sharpe, Mortensen, and Lesley Visser. On Aug. 2, a
30-minute version of the show kicks off the preseason. On Aug. 9,
``Monday Night Countdown'' airs from Canton, Ohio, preceeding the
Hall of Fame Game between the Browns and Cowboys on ABC.

Sept. 12 at 11. Jim McKay recently re-signed with ABC for a
multiyear deal. Under the agreement, McKay will continue to cover
horse racing and the British Open . . . ESPN Classic airs a new
30-minute program Wednesday featuring classic moments in horse
racing. McKay and Jack Whitaker host ``Thoroughbred Classics

New England and the Dallas Burn will be carried by Fox Sports New
England at 7:30 p.m. Fox signed a five-year, $650 million deal to
broadcast Dominican Republic pro baseball, starting Oct. 22.

NASHVILLE BREAKS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We are,'' says guitarist Ruyter Suys (pronounced ``Rider
Sighs''), of the band Nashville Pussy, ``aiming for the more basic
enthusiasms of life, just having a good time. I mean, the message
is: Forget everything. Drink if you have to. What we do is
low-attention-span music, but there is more behind it, also,
something that will immediately grab you. We started the band out
of boredom, and we wanted to start a band that we wanted to go and
see. I have always wanted to see a chick go nuts on stage. I'm
really apalled that it's me doing it. I thought for sure somebody
else would be doing it by now.''
</P>
<P>
   And, these Nashville cats offer not one chick going nuts, but
two, the other being Amazon-like fire-breathing bassist Corey
Parks, sister of Minnesota Timberwolves center Cherokee Parks.
Also, front and center is Suys's husband, singer-guitarist Blaine
Cartwright. At one or more points during an NP show you can bet all
three will be involved in some serious lip-locking. (``We have our
little moment,'' says Suys.) And they will indulge in lots of
sleazy, speedy rocking.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: If Beavis and Butt-head were still with us,
this band would be their very favorite. The group plays heavy, fast
rock 'n' roll, a steamrolling sound that might best be referenced
as Motorhead meets Lynyrd Skynyrd, with bits of AC/DC and Ted
Nugent tossed in. Suys and Parks are not ones to wear much clothing
so, as with the Cramps, sexuality is never far from the center of
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Got a problem with that? Suys purrs a curse and says, ``Some
people can't take a joke. This is (expletive) fun. It is the
greatest job in the world. . . . Why are guys the only ones allowed
to be sexy on stage? I have been turned on by every rock musician
from Angus Young to Jimmy Page. I was getting turned on before I
knew what turned on was. . . . There is no reason for anybody to
get offended about what we do. We are trying to have a simple, good
old-fashioned rock 'n' roll show and there is nothing heavy,
mind-altering, or mind-boggling about what we are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   You might consider the group a rougher and more ribald version
of Southern Culture on the Skids. They drape the Confederate flag
behind them on stage; they pose for photos with guns. They write
songs like ``Snake Eyes,'' ``Kicked in the Teeth,'' ``Eat My
Dust,'' and ``Somebody Shoot Me.'' (There are a few unprintable
titles, as well.) Their fans and friends include actor Stephen
Baldwin, KISS bassist Gene Simmons, singer/ex-porn star Traci
Lords, actress Alicia Silverstone, and rockers Rob Zombie and
Juliana Hatfield.
</P>
<P>
   The band, which also includes drummer Jeremy Thompson, is a
perfect example of the old punk-rock DIY (do-it-yourself) ethic.
Based in Atlanta, the band was formed in 1996; the name was taken
from a comment Nugent made on stage recorded on a live album. Suys,
a Vancouver native, says she and Cartwright became a romantic
couple before they became a rock 'n' roll couple _ five days of
loving until they picked up guitars. Cartwright hails from
Kentucky, Parks from California, Thompson from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   They started at point zero. They recorded an independent album
for the Minneapolis-based Amphetamine Reptile label, toured
relentlessly, built up a rabid following by word-of-mouth, signed
to a major label (which rereleased the album) and, of all things,
got nominated for a Grammy in the heavy metal category. This was
clearly the weirdest Grammy nomination since GWAR received one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a message on our answering machine from a reporter in
Nashville,'' says Suys, ``and he said he was calling to get our
reaction to the Grammy nomination. We played the message nine times
before we called back. We were like `What?! This is insane.' Sure
enough, it was real.''
</P>
<P>
   Affiliation with Mercury hasn't really changed their approach.
The four tour constantly, without record company tour support, and
don't expect the company's full attention at all times. They know
it's their lives, their career, and they want to steer. They just
recorded a new album, with plans for a Christmas release. ``The
record is longer, more varied, a few more mid-tempo songs,'' says
Suys. ``We have learned how to groove. When we did that first
album, we thought we were Aerosmith and we are so totally not
Aerosmith. Now, we think we're a boogie band.''
</P>
<P>
   For Suys, who jerks about on stage like her idol Angus Young of
AC/DC, playing raw, sweaty rock 'n' roll serves a dual purpose.
One, she gets to kick out the jams. Two, she gets to be a role
model for girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going through a guitar magazine the other day,'' she
says, ``and there were two women in the entire magazine and both of
them were being used to sell merchandise. Not a single one of them
was presented as a musician _ they were just chicks hanging on a
guitar. I am, like, `This is terrible.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Suys's own role models _ and this may be the first time these
two ladies were ever linked _ were the late Plasmatics singer Wendy
O. Williams and Heart guitarist Nancy Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the two women who have done something for me,'' Suys
says. ``Everybody else is, like, `Joni Mitchell,' and I grew up on
that for a while and it was good, but that's not where I want to
go.'' Wilson gave Suys the confidence to play lead; Williams gave
her the confidence to embrace a take-no-prisoners philosophy and to
use her sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Is there an element of shtick involved? Sure. A member of the
band Gaunt, which toured with NP last year, said the band was like
KISS, its apparently spontaneous moves well choreographed. So be
it. ``You get your moves down and it turns the whole show into one
big unit rather than a bunch of little pieces put together,'' says
Suys. ``We always try to make it a roller coaster, rather than
going on a bunch of different rides. . . . I am more me when I am
on stage than anywhere else. At the same time, I am like a monkey,
a goofy kind of monkey girl, running around causing trouble. That's
basically what I am, a little kid. When I am off stage I somehow
become really responsible, which makes being on stage so much
fun.''

WHY NOT NEW CELLAR WINDOWS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 1, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I need old windows for my cellar to replace some rotted ones.
Where can I find old ones?
</P>
<P>
   TONY RICCI, Dedham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try a salvage yard, but you might not find the right sizes,
and who knows that windows as old as yours might not be decaying,
too. So why replace the old windows with old windows? I think you
are better off with new ones; you can get the right size, the wood
is treated (not pressure-treated) to resist decay, and it is an
easy matter to slip them in the rough opening in the concrete
foundation. You may have to glue them in with construction
adhesive.
</P>
<P>
   You can order wood cellar windows from Brockway-Smith at a local
lumber store, not a chain, although a chain might have some in
stock. Styles are limited, but not sizes; besides, who needs style
in cellar windows?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My old steel cellar windows are rusting badly and I'd like to
replace them with wood. How can I remove them? They must have been
installed when the foundation was poured.
</P>
<P>
   ANXIOUS IN DORCHESTER
</P>
<P>
   A. You got that right; those frames were, indeed, in place when
the concrete was poured around them. First, remove the sash (the
frame holding the glass); the hinges are riveted, so you may have
to pry them off. Trying to hammer the frame out is likely to break
a lot of concrete, so you will have to cut the frame out with a
power hacksaw; a sword saw with heavy hacksaw blade would do it.
Actually, you may have to cut only three sides; then you can wiggle
or worry out the fourth frame, working it back and forth. Be
careful that you don't wiggle too far; this can break the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   You can leave the cut flanges embedded in the concrete, then
install a wood window.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about it, you may not have to cut out the frame. Remove
only the sash (the frame holding the glass). Then rabbet the new
wood window's frame so that it can be installed in the opening
against the steel frame. This way you can drill through the steel
frame to hold the wood window in place.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When we bought our house, the inspector said the attic space
is badly mildewed because the attic is sealed with no vents at all.
He suggested we put in vents, which we will do. One contractor
would charge $500 to put in vents. Doesn't that seem kind of high?
</P>
<P>
   SALLY CARROLL, North Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There's nothing like an unvented attic to cause mildew to
grow. It's the same with a closed-in basement, to cause that dank,
musty smell and all kinds of mildew growth. Ugh. At least it is
curable by ventilation, allowing excess water vapor to escape.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of putting in vents depends on what the vents are and
where they are.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal venting system is a ridge vent going the full length
of the roof ridge, and soffit vents (a continuous two-inch-wide
strip along the full length of the the soffit, the under part of
the roof overhang). A ridge vent costs about $10 per foot,
installed, soffit vents mabe $5 per foot, installed. If your house
is 30 feet long, the ridge vent would cost $300, and the vent on
each soffit (one in front and one in back) would be $150, for a
total of $600. So that $500 may not be exorbitant.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to move my water bed in the basement elsewhere in
the house. Obviously I have to drain the water; can I drain the
water through the washing machine drain?
</P>
<P>
   BILL ANTOS, Hyannis, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You can if the house is on sewers and not a septic tank. I
think that much water would overload a septic system. Or, why not
syphon it outdoors and save the water for irrigation?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The wood bottom of my painted garage door is crumbling, and
the rubber gasket on the bottom edge is loose. Can that be fixed,
or do I need a new door?
</P>
<P>
   BENJAMIN CHERNOFF, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You might not need a door, despite what the makers of the
door might say. You may have to make repairs yourself, because it
would be difficult to find a handyperson willing to do such a fussy
job.
</P>
<P>
   These paneled, folding doors have a wide rail at the bottom;
this is the rail that is decayed. First, remove the gasket, then
determine how deep the decay is gone into the wood. Cut off the
decayed part; that is, cut several inches off that rail, and cut a
filler piece of pressure-treated wood to attach to the bottom. If
the filler peice is less than a few inches thick, screw it on; if
it is more than a few inches, you will have to secure it with
mending plates. Reapply the gasket and repaint the door. It should
be good for many more years.
</P>
<P>
   And if that all seems too fussy, too much work or simply not to
your liking, a new door is the only way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you will have to replace the entire rail, which makes
it more complicated because the new rail would also have to secure
the panels. With that in mind, this too is a reason to buy a new
door.
</P>

RADIO STATION ASKS EMPLOYEES TO RETURN TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Employees of Berkeley's landmark public radio
station have turned down an invitation to return to work and
demanded to see the offer in writing from the Pacifica Foundation,
which owns KPFA-FM.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the KPFA steering committee, who represent the
station's employees, volunteers and listeners involved in federal
mediation with the management, accused Pacifica chairwoman Mary
Frances Berry on Thursday of circumventing the mediation process by
going directly to the news media with her offer to reopen the
station.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of noisy protesters stormed the radio station in
mid-July after the management dismissed its third radio host in
three months at the 50-year-old station. And more than a dozen KPFA
supporters were arrested during a protest at the station in June.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime staffers maintain that Pacifica's board wants to give
KPFA a more mainstream image so that it can attract corporate
donations. Others worry that KPFA, traditionally a loud liberal
voice, might be sold to a commercial buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as representatives of this effort, won't trust any offer
that isn't in writing,'' said Robbie Osman, a steering committee
member who had a weekly music program on KPFA until he was fired
last month. ``We have experience with (Berry) saying things to the
press, and doing the exact opposite the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Berry said that re-opening the station was not an
offer but a decision. She asked the employees to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between the listener-sponsored KPFA and the
Pacifica governing board has been in a stalemate for two weeks,
with the station airing only tapes of old programs and federal
mediation showing few signs of progress.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said she called both the local and international heads of
the Communications Workers of America, which represents roughly two
dozen KPFA workers, to explain the decision to re-open.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, the union has been notified up and
down the line of the fact that we intend to open the station,'' she
said. ``The union is perfectly able to inform everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who is also chairwoman of the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission, said she was surprised at the workers' confusion. She
said she was ``puzzled because all the things we did are things
they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Osman said the Pacifica negotiating team, which includes
executive director Lynn Chadwick, had nothing in writing to present
Thursday at the mediation session. Chadwick did not return a
telephone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   KPFA's 11-member steering committee represents not only the 25
or so unionized staff members, but also the hundreds of non-union
workers, volunteers and listeners, said Osman, who is not a union
member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Frances Berry has simply never communicated with this
group of 11,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's offer was drafted at a meeting Wednesday of the
six-member executive committee of the Pacifica Foundation board. It
was arrived at after much debate, said executive committee member
Jewelle Taylor-Gibbs, a psychologist and professor at the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to come to a consensus on the board. We've
had intense discussion,'' Taylor-Gibbs said. ``This proposal is an
honest-to-goodness effort to make peace with the committee and the
protesters.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the board has made tremendous concessions and hoped
workers will return to work.
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica also owns and operates stations in Houston, Los
Angeles, New York and Washington, D.C.

   BOSTON -- Norma Rosario, whose skin is the color of coffee with
a dash of cream, was known as Latino back in Puerto Rico, but when
she and her family moved to Boston in 1980 they were commonly
referred to as African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother was stopped by the police constantly because they
thought he was black,'' said Rosario. ``The color lines are clearer
here, but in Puerto Rico it's more political.''
</P>
<P>
   While the decision to allow US residents to choose more than one
race on next year's census survey will give Rosario and others a
chance to select their own identity, the move has also forced an
unprecedented bond among black, Hispanic, and Asian civil rights
groups that fear the change will undermine their political gains
and divide their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   This week, national Hispanic and Asian leaders met with their
respective communities in Boston to urge residents to accurately
fill out their ethnicity as well as their race on the 2000 census
forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe if you are of African descent and you are also, say,
Panamanian, then you are African-American as well as Latino,'' said
Beatriz Lopez-Flores, vice president of education and public policy
for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ``We
understand the racial dynamics of this country and we are trying to
educate people on this.''
</P>
<P>
   MALDES shares the concern voiced by black leaders and race
specialists across the country that the new survey could undermine
the social gains and solidarity of the nation's 34 million people
of African descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a diversionary tactic to deplete our numbers and
influence in the political arena,'' said Minister Don Muhammad of
The Nation of Islam in Boston. ``This is done to keep the so-called
minority groups from uniting and becoming a political force in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern is that some Hispanics and biracial residents,
fearing they will be stigmatized if they check ``black'' in the
race category, will instead identify themselves as white, diluting
the numbers of the country's African-American population.
</P>
<P>
   The federal census was never meant as a forum for racial
expression, said James S. Jackson, an African-American adviser for
the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   But that is exactly what it has become, some critics say.
Minorities fear that the rule change will prompt some residents _
who had in the past chosen one race or another on the form _ to
check more than one box or write in another race, in effect
creating a separate race category.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said advisers from every minority group have opposed the
change; so now those groups are working with the federal government
to ensure their communities are accurately counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very much together on this. We are with our black and
Latino brothers,'' said Glenn Magpantay, a member of the Asian
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, the federal government has stuck to four racial
categories on the census: black, white, American Indian or Alaska
native, and Asian or Pacific Islander, which consists of several
subcategories. But those choices came under criticism by people
such as golf superstar Tiger Woods, who said that America's
categorization of its minorities was not reflecting his mixed
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, 1 million children in the United States were of
mixed-race parentage; that number had doubled by the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   While the federal government has not established a tabulation
method for the new census forms, Claudette Bennett, chief of race
and statistics for the US Census Bureau in Washington, said a
respondent who chooses more than one race will be placed in a
category called ``two or more'' races. The other approach will be
to count every single response in the race category. Civil rights
officials are estimating a possible 63 race combinations.
</P>
<P>
   The census has far-reaching implications, said Magpantay, since
the data is often used for social programs and political
representation.
</P>
<P>
   State Representative Byron Rushing, a Boton Democrat, believes
the change will only further prove that race is a made-up social
construct in this country. ``The most important thing is that
people fill out the forms and they are counted, rather than what
race they choose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to check off more than one box instead of wholly
claiming black could give a false impression that America is moving
to a mixed and colorblind society, said Emmett Schaefer, an adjunct
professor of sociology at the University of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That social construct is still with us _ black and white _ and
so are the consequences,'' he said. ``A person with dark skin who
drives in a new car, the police will still stop them not factoring
in that he may be be mixed with Irish or Cherokee,'' said Schaefer.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario said she is proud and open about her black, Indian, and
Spanish heritage _ but she will only mark Latino on the census, and
not choose a race _ exactly what minority groups don't want to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself Latino,'' said Rosario. ``But my daughter
will choose African-American because her father and friends are
black, and my son will choose Latino because his friends are
Latino.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilda Hurdle was born in Panama, where her ancestors from
Jamaica and Barbados migrated in the early part of the century to
work on the Panama Canal. While she is clearly of African descent
with her dark complexion, her race was never an issue until she
moved to the United States as a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   While she will mark herself as some race other than black on the
census, Hurdle will identify her American-born daughter as black.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the way Americans view her daughter's skin color,
Hurdle said the girl ``doesn't have a choice (in America) and
therefore she will only be seen as one or the other (black or
white). I have a choice because I come from Panama.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurdle's brother, however, a lawyer, will mark both Latino and
black.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez-Flores said that regardless of a person's choice on the
census survey, the reality is that Hispanics in this country are
considered second-class citizens, as are blacks: ``So the person
who is Mexican and chooses white is still a Mexican,'' she said.
``For Hispanics what is crucial is that we want them to be as
accurate as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Census officials say they don't know the social ramifications of
the change. Census trial tests have shown that only a small
percentage of those taking the survey considered themselves
multiracial. In Columbia, S.C., less than 1 percent of the
population chose two or more races on the test forms.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the census adviser, is concerned that the change may
cause a schism among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans don't have a problem saying they are
black,'' he said, ``but those who do have been (calling themselves)
something else for a very long time.''

WHAT DO THE RICH GET FROM THE TAX BILL? MORE, OF COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A million bucks ain't what it used to be. That's why so many
millionaires want what Samuel Gompers wanted for the labor
movement: more.
</P>
<P>
   And more is what the rich would get from the obscenely bloated
tax bill belched out by the Republican Congress and laying like a
beached whale on a Cape Cod beach. Like a dead whale, this lumpy
titan of a tax boondoggle can never again do what it was designed
to do. But the sheer bulk of it leaves one dumb-struck.
</P>
<P>
   What hath the House of Reps wrought? Another giveaway to the
rich. ``Everyone's Getting Rich!'' hollered Money Magazine's May
cover. Really? Congress knows better. They're not fools, even if
they play the part.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a crash course in political economy. In presidential
elections, the two major parties each start out with roughly 40
percent of the vote. The 20 percent in the middle decide the
outcome. The winner has to get to 51. How? By convincing, seducing,
or frightening at least 11 of the 20 to vote for you, natch. But
not everyone who can votes. The poorer, younger, more nonwhite you
are, the less likely you'll vote. Sad but true.
</P>
<P>
   So to get to 51, the winner can afford to ignore those poor,
young, or nonwhite voters you can figure will be too busy,
discouraged, or ignorant to understand that not voting their own
best interest pushes them further behind on the earning curve. So
both parties make their pitch to a richer slice of the spectrum of
earning power.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats spend less time and money courting the underclass,
because they won't vote; that's why you got all the ``welfare
reform.'' Democratic priorities run from the working poor to the
middle class. Democrats run out of gas for taxpayers with incomes
between $75,000 and maybe $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans start getting worked up on behalf of the
$75,000-per-year crowd, and get feverish on behalf of the rich.
Example: the House GOP tax bill would give back to a two-parent
family with two kids the following: $841 if the family lives on
$75,000, $4,084 if the family has $200,000, and $31,138 smackeroos
for the $1 million per year family. Is that fair? Or is that
entertainment for the plutocracy?
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a bad season of impeachment (Clinton won) and the
Kosovo war (Clinton won) and fearful of losing the skinny five-seat
margin which gives them precarious control of the House, the GOP
needed a juicy issue. Who can say no to a tax cut, right? Clinton's
veto will derail the GOP freight train, something perhaps half its
size will be approved, probably reducing the extra burden hefted by
married couples over singles, and propping up Social Security and
Medicaid. Then comes the election. Way out in front is Texas
Governor George W. Bush, who has raised $200,000 a day all year
long because well-off people think they'll be even richer if he
wins next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reaps cash forked over by business lobbyists benefiting
from the $100 billion in tax breaks the GOP voted for
multi-nationals, utilities, oil and gas, timber, steel, and
insurance interests. ``. . . the fine print will reveal another
cornucopia for the special interests, and a chamber of horrors for
the taxpayers,'' gripes Arizona Senator John McCain, who may be
Bush's principal opposition in New Hampshire's perhaps-decisive
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people who track the numbers on how wealth is
divvied up in America are amazed at how docile are the middle class
and working class folk whose share has dropped. ``Most households
have lower net worth than they did in 1983, when the Dow (Jones
Industrial Average) was still at 1,000,'' instead of 11 times
higher. ``Average workers are earning less, adjusting for
inflation, than they did when Richard Nixon was president.''
</P>
<P>
   These claims come from a left-leaning worker's rights outfit,
United For a Fair Economy in Boston (Web site: www.stw.org) in a
scary little book of plain hard numbers, titled ``Shifting
Fortunes: The perils of the growing American wealth gap.'' The
richest one percent got 42 percent of the stock market gravy; the
next richest 9 percent got 44 percent; that leaves 14 percent of
the gravy for 90 percent of the people. Hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom 40 percent of households lost an astonishing 80
percent of net worth'' from '83 to '85. Working women pad out
family incomes; one out of five families is in red ink. It's the
``middle Americans'' who got creamed, argues MIT's Lester Thurow in
the book's foreword. The middle 80 percent ``are the big losers
over the last 25 years . . . At some point, those who are losing
economically have to use their political power to vote in a
government that reverses the outcome of the market. No one knows
where this point is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester, in politics, the points are at the working end of the
pitchfork.

CLINTON'S BAND SINGS SAME OLD SONGS TO WORKING POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the beginning of July, President Clinton took the Grateful
Poor Tour. Grateful Poor tours are conducted every few years when
the Democrats are in the White House or every few decades when the
Republicans are in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   They are scheduled only after presidents have taken care of
corporations, defense contractors, party donors, and selected
international hotspots. These are called ``vital interests.'' The
Grateful Poor are called such because everyone knows they are not
vital interests, having been ignored during this great outbreak of
foreign sweatshops, suburban sprawl, and celebratory cigars.
</P>
<P>
   In the concert world, Grateful tours played the same old songs
to everyone's satisfaction until Jerry Garcia's final breath. In
politics, the Grateful Poor Tour has begun to grate on people whom
the president assumes will bow down and lay carpets across their
streets of broken bottles and dreams when he shows up.
</P>
<P>
   In Watts, Clinton visited a high school where few members of the
actual community were allowed to attend his speech. A 75-year-old
man from the neighborhood who came in a suit and tie, but was
denied entrance, said, ``If the community's not here, it's not
serving any purpose. They could have held it downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went to an Oglala Lakota Sioux reservation at Pine
Ridge, S.D. He hoped no one remembered that he signed a budget for
the Bureau of Indian Affairs that was cut by Congress in 1995 and
that Indians are suing the government for mismanaged trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of members of that tribe are being actively
defrauded by the Clinton administration,'' said Jim McCarthy, a
consultant in the trust fund suit. ``For him to go out there and
throw some crumbs off the federal plate is really appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there were still plenty of Grateful Poor to lay out
the carpets in these places as well as Appalachia, Mississippi,
East St. Louis, and Phoenix. There were enough individual success
stories to make it seem on TV that poverty is being attacked. But
child poverty has remained at around 20 percent during the Clinton
era. Poverty rates for Indians, Latinos, and African-Americans
remain more than twice that of white Americans.
</P>
<P>
   While official poverty declined in Clinton's time from 15.1
percent to 13.3 percent, the wealth gap between rich and poor has
never been wider and real wages for all but high-income workers
have stagnated or fallen. What the overall poverty rate does not
say is that the poverty rate among workers has actually increased
from 5.7 percent in 1979 to 6.7 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   What Grateful Poor tours rarely explore is how the working poor
actually feel. Last week, Rutgers University's Heldrich Center for
Workforce Development and the University of Connecticut's Center
for Survey Research and Analysis released a nationwide survey of
500 adults, most of whom made $25,000 or less.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, ``Working Hard But Staying Poor,'' found an upbeat
work force, with 84 percent of participants generally satisfied
with their jobs. Only 24 percent of the working poor wanted to work
less, compared to 58 percent of other workers from earlier Rutgers
studies. Conversely, 24 percent of the working poor said they want
to work more, compared to 12 percent of other workers. ``The
working poor and the unemployed are in large numbers seeking a
better life and are willing to work for it,'' the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   But the opportunities for a better job are slim. Eighty-one
percent of the working poor say they would enroll in an education
or training program. But only 18 percent work for employers who
give financial help to enroll in off-site job training or education
(compared to 36 percent of higher-income workers). Only 27 percent
have received government aid for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Without that education or training, the working poor will not be
able to bridge the digital gap. The survey found that 48 percent of
the working poor and unemployed use computers on the job or at
home, compared to 77 percent of other workers. In addition, it
would sure help if jobs were located near them. Nine out of 10
respondents said they need jobs in their community. But many were
also willing to move or commute with better public transit.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that the best immediate ways to raise the
living standards of the working poor is to increase the minimum
wage to $6.15 an hour, improve on-site childcare and public
transit, and increase job training and education opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The working poor and unemployed have less access to the
critical paths of opportunity in the new economy,'' it said. To
provide that access, particularly at a time of widening wealth
gaps, presidents will have to do more than announce a tour of the
Grateful Poor. The president will have to bring along the
instruments so the poor can get up on the stage and jam.

GROUPS SEEK TO REVERSE RULING ON CALIFORNIA GAS SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two environmental organizations have gone to
court seeking to reverse a state regulatory agency's ruling giving
the Chevron Corp. the right to sell gasoline that does not meet the
California's stringent clean-air requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Communities for a Better Environment and Earth Island Institute
filed a request Thursday for an injunction against the state Air
Resources Board in San Francisco Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   They are trying to overturn the board's decision two weeks ago
giving Chevron permission to sell gasoline that does not meet
clean-air standards.
</P>
<P>
   An explosion at Chevron's Richmond refinery damaged a unit used
to produce the gasoline, called reformulated clean fuel. Chevron
requested the emergency variance to sell gasoline from other states
for 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   The two environmental groups say the refining and use of up to
3.5 million barrels of the gasoline would add 23 tons of volatile
organic compounds and 7 tons of nitrogen oxides to the skies every
day.
</P>
<P>
   The compounds react in sunlight to produce ground-level ozone,
the primary ingredient of summer smog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selling dirty gasoline will endanger public health and the
environment,'' said Denny Larson, the Northern California director
of Communities for a Better Environment. ``Yet, the Air Resources
Board failed to implement any effective measures to offset the tons
of extra pollution. Offsets are required by state law.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, which received the variance on July 15, hasn't yet sold
any of the gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, we've been fortunate to continue to supply California
cleaner-burning gasoline, and haven't needed to sell one drop of
the variance fuel,;; said Nancy Malinowski, a spokeswoman for
Chevron, which is based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will only use it as a last resort. We don't have an
incentive to use the fuel,'' she said. The state will levy a
15-cent fee on each gallon that doesn't meet its standards.
</P>
<P>
   So far Chevron has been able to get cleaner fuel from Finland,
Korea and the Los Angeles area, while it works to fix the damaged
unit, Malinowski said.
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't know how long Chevron can find enough to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry inventories are tight, and it's the peak of the
summer driving season. The price of crude oil has gone from roughly
$12 a barrel to $20 in two months. The market is responding to
it,'' she said.

   SPEND-CONGRESS (Washington) _ Congress, determined to increase
military spending and unable to cut the rest of the budget deeper
than it has already done, is certain to wipe out the projected
$14.5 billion surplus in coming weeks. Now the Republican
leadership is scouring the entire federal budget, seeking unspent
money from programs like Medicaid, welfare benefits and interstate
highway funds to fill a spending gap that is running upwards of $15
billion. Strict spending caps, which have helped create the
surplus, may be broken in the process. By Tim Weiner.

food, and Aisle 9, featuring peanut butter and jelly, is Pepsico
chairman Roger A. Enrico's vision of the future: ``the Power
Aisle,'' a large space stocked with mostly Pepsi soft drinks and
Frito-Lay snack food. Pepsi's hope is that a shopper looking for a
two-liter bottle of Mountain Dew will grab a bag of Cool Ranch
Doritos as well. The goal, of course, is to pump up Pepsi's sales
and profits by taking advantage of some synergies unavailable to
its arch-rival, Coke, and thereby boost its lagging share price. By

 &HT;    CLINTON, WORLD LEADERS SET BLUEPRINT FOR PEACE IN TROUBLED
BALKANS
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trim.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Victors in war, the United States
and its European allies rallied here Friday around a blueprint for
peace in the troubled region scarred by Europe's bloodiest
conflicts since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and his counterparts from 40 other nations --
including Russia, Britain, Germany, France -- launched a
broad-ranging Balkans Stability Pact, meant to ensure that the
major powers won't simply walk away from the region now that the
flames of its latest conflict have been smothered by NATO air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to talk about a greater Europe, based on including
people, and healing,'' Clinton said in a speech at a local high
school following the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war is over,'' Clinton said, ``but we have to build a
better peace for Bosnians and all the people of southeastern
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, told
reporters that Clinton stressed during the summit the need for a
comprehensive, regional approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal here is to begin the process of integrating this
region into the mainstream of Europe,'' Clinton told leaders
attending the one-day summit, meant to be the diplomatic capstone
to NATO's qualified success in Kosovo. ``We can't do it one country
at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbia, though, is being excluded from the benefits of Friday's
Stability Pact, so long as Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
Yugoslavia's president, remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, under indictment as a war criminal, was not invited.
His political opponents were.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade-long campaign by Mr. Milosevic to carve out a greater
Serbia has left more than a quarter million people dead, uprooted
millions more and undermined the stability of this entire region,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbia will only have a future when Mr. Milosevic and his
policies are consigned to the past,'' he added. In a closing
statement, he and the other leaders appealed to Serb-led Yugoslavia
``to embrace democratic change and work actively for regional
reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In a smaller but decidedly more tangible gesture, Clinton
delivered 10 new Apple I-Mac computers -- still in their jelly-bean
colored boxes -- to a local high school the president hailed as a
model of multi-ethnic recovery for a region shattered by nearly a
decade of ethnically-based bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This school is a monument to Sarajevo's proud tradition of
teaching young people from all backgrounds,'' said Clinton,
speaking before several hundred students, dignitaries and local
residents at the school, named the Third Gymnasium. ``I want this
school, this school rebuilt, to be the symbol of all of our
tomorrows.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's Balkans summit, held in this former Olympic host city
that endured a bloody siege at the hands of Serb snipers and
gunners from 1992 until 1995, was in itself a richly symbolic vote
of confidence in Balkans renewal.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders met in the Zetra arena, where East German figure
skater Katerina Witt won her gold medal in the 1984 Winter Games.
The arena was an early casualty of the war and Friday's summit
marked its first use since its reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew in aboard a giant C-17 military cargo jet, landing
at Sarajevo International Airport, one of the most hazardous spots
in town during the three-and-a-half year war.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The stability pact -- a package of programs, incentives and aid
meant to promote security, democratization, free market reforms and
economic growth -- is essentially a promise that the United States
and its allies will remain deeply engaged for years to come in a
region where four wars have been fought since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Three of those conflicts -- in Bosnia, Croatia and the Serb
province of Kosovo -- have involved U.S. and other NATO forces. A
fourth, in Slovenia, lasted only a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire purpose of this is to make sure that the fourth war
in the former Yugoslavia is the last ethnic war, or conflict,
regarding the territory of the former Yugoslavia,'' said NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea. ``We don't want any more of those.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 6,200 U.S. peacekeepers in Bosnia, as part of a larger
NATO force of 29,000. Another 7,500 American troops are going into
nearby Kosovo as part of a NATO contingent rapidly working its way
to the 50,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign troops alone, however, won't secure an enduring peace,
said Clinton, who focused Friday on augmenting security efforts
with economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   With annual income averaging less than $2,000 per person, the
Balkan countries are the poorest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered a five-point plan for helping promote growth.
</P>
<P>
   By themselves, the measures are low-octane steps. Clinton's hope
is that the initiatives he proposed would be echoed by European
countries to amplify the impact. European leaders responded
favorably, Berger said, and indicated that they would soon take up
the matter before the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Among Clinton's proposals were:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  a reduction in tariffs charged on certain products shipped
from the region to the United States, in a change that, if approved
by Congress, could mean reductions of up to $80 million, over five
years, in the price U.S. consumers would pay for Balkan footwear
and other goods;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  an investment compact -- complete with a planned autumn trade
mission -- aimed at increasing private U.S. investment in Balkan
countries that take steps to help safeguard foreign capital, combat
corruption and let the market take over where central governments
have long held sway;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $350 million in funding to help back loans to businesses
willing to invest and trade with Balkans countries considered as
high risk propositions by commercial banks;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and $34 million for loans to small and medium-sized
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's summit comes on the heels of an agreement by the United
States and its key allies to pony up $2 billion for immediate
humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in Kosovo, a province of
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo was ravaged this spring by attacks targeting ethnic
Albanians by Serb-led Yugoslav forces, and by 78 days of NATO air
strikes targeting those forces.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Kosovo, the air strikes destroyed more than 700 major
targets throughout Serbia. Bridges were dropped into the Danube
River, refineries and factories were bombed to ruins and dozens of
key highway interchanges were reduced to rubble in damage Belgrade
claims would cost scores of billions of dollars to repair.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders tough position to exclude Serbia from any
reconstruction efforts or economic aid to the Balkans was a sharp
contrast with Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, who said the
West is wrong to make aid to Serbia conditional on Milosevic's
departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not associate (ourselves) with this strict linkage that
it's either Milosevic or assistance,'' Stepashin told a news
conference after the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding Yugoslavia from a stability pact endorsed by the
Sarajevo summit could prove an obstacle to lasting peace in the
region and would hurt innocent Serbs, Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
   The West's approach ``could lead to very serious
repercussions,'' Stepashin said through an interpreter.

SHUTTLES MAY BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME TO COME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ Two decades after its birth, and 13
years after its worst tragedy, the space shuttle has become
America's year-round trucking service into space, an aging but
respected draft horse in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   But the venerable shuttle fleet isn't likely to be replaced for
decades to come, NASA officials, engineers and former astronauts
say because Congress is unlikely to give the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration the money.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the shuttle _ packed with technology that dates, in some
cases, to the 1950s and 1960s _ may become the B-52 bomber of the
early 21st century: a high-tech antique, still piercing the skies
in the 2020s and 2030s, flown by pilots who weren't even alive when
it first flew.
</P>
<P>
   The B-52 analogy is valid, said Bernard Shaw, a former space
shuttle commander who is now vice president and general manager of
the International Space Station project for Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect that ... the space shuttle will be hard to
replace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for completion about 2005, the space station is being
assembled primarily by shuttle launches that carry components to
low Earth orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Delayed retirement is a noble but ironic fate for the shuttle
fleet, which almost died in its crib in the 1970s, when
then-President Richard Nixon half-heartedly proposed it to a
reluctant Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The end also seemed certain when, in January 1986, the shuttle
Challenger exploded over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 13 years later, long after doomsayers had predicted a second
shuttle disaster to occur, the fleet is still flying an average of
seven to eight times a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to come anywhere near the life span of the
shuttle in the next 10 years,'' former space shuttle commander
Andrew Allen told conferees at the Space Shuttle Development
Conference at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Allen is now director of space shuttle development for United
Space Alliance, a shuttle-managing consortium created by the
Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing that has managed shuttle flights
under contract to NASA since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although Allen expects the four shuttles _ Columbia, Atlantis,
Endeavour and Discovery _ to age gracefully, they must be upgraded
to make them safer and more efficient, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because long-hoped-for replacement vehicles _ such as
single stage to orbit (SSTO) vehicles that would take off and land
like airplanes _ aren't likely to become major players in aerospace
for decades, given present tight federal funding for aerospace
research.
</P>
<P>
   Federal funding is so tight that William Readdy, NASA's deputy
associate administrator for space flight, jokingly denied Thursday
that he was ``back in Washington holding a bake sale to see if we
could fund some of these (shuttle) upgrades.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep the aging shuttles reliable for many years to come,
specialists are discussing ways to refit them. The proposals
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Replacing the shuttle's dangerous solid-rocket boosters, which
played a key role in the fatal 1986 Challenger explosion, with
reusable, winged liquid-fueled rockets that would drop off during
launch and return to Earth. _ Placing electronic components inside
the whitish tiles that serve as the shuttle's skin and protect it
from severe heat as it re-enters the atmosphere. The electronics
would automatically warn ground crews if a tile had been damaged
by, say, a meteor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Replacing helium-gas-triggered actuators that activate shuttle
mechanical components with more reliable, gas-free alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, the former shuttle commander, insists that NASA must make
do with the shuttles for a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vehicles just get so much tender loving care that they're
almost like new when they lift off,'' he said. ``There's no reason
you can't fly these things a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he acknowledged, the nation must consider
developing a complementary or backup space transportation system.

<P>
   VALLEY TOWNSHIP, Pa. _ It's a strange caravan that moves along
the country road on a scorching hot summer day.
</P>
<P>
   A tan van leads the way with the words, ``Stonewalk, Veterans
for Peace,'' printed on its side. Seven men of varying ages are
behind it, hand-pulling a 2,000-pound tombstone on a caisson
decorated with an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   It is the 24th day of their 33-day mission to deliver the stone
honoring civilian war victims to an unknown site at Arlington
National Cemetery, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most fitting way to bring the memorial to
Arlington,'' said Karl Schlotterbeck, a project coordinator. ``It's
a struggle, but it shows our devotion to the cause and our concern
and anguish over the deaths of civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Stonewalk was organized by a peace group called the Peace Abbey
in Sherborn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The gray stone _ it's inscription reads ``Unknown Civilians
Killed in War'' _ was loaded onto the caisson in Sherborn on July
4. The 1-ton piece of granite had been unveiled there by Muhammad
Ali in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The group is scheduled to end its 485 mile journey at Arlington
National Cemetery on Aug. 6, the anniversary of the bombing of
Hiroshima. However, cemetery officials said they will not be able
to leave the stone in the cemetery. That would require
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   As a compromise, cemetery superintendent John Metzler spoke by
phone with Stonewalk organizers on Thursday and they agreed to
leave the headstone with a yet-to-be-designated embassy in
Washington. It is not clear what will then happen to the stone, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   White roses have been placed on top of the tombstone, which is
surrounded by the flags of all nations. Black and purple bunting
are on both sides of the caisson. Bottles of water, which provide
liquid relief in the blazing heat, are stored in the back under
more bunting of red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   During their journey, organizer Lewis Randa said they've
attracted as many as 25 volunteers in a single day. They have been
of varying ages and walks of life, including members of Scout
troops, veterans, children and police officers. A man in
Connecticut celebrated his 84th birthday by taking 84 steps pulling
the stone.
</P>
<P>
   As it passed near Valley Township this past week, the group was
down to seven volunteers. They began their day around 9 a.m. and
had been pushing and pulling ever since. The day usually starts
with breakfast. Trail mix and granola bars sustain them until their
next big meal in the late afternoon or early evening.
</P>
<P>
   Fair weather or foul, they walk every day. Rain has provided
relief only once, said Schlotterbeck, who has been associated with
the Peace Abbey for almost 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dennes (CQ) Wilson, 20, joined the group in Paoli, Pa. He'd read
about their mission and happened to see them chugging along through
his small community. They asked his family for a place to stay that
night and he went out with them that next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wilson did not plan to make the entire trek to Arlington,
he said that's partly why the mission is so amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, it's a trip of faith. You pull it through your own
community and someone from another community will replace you,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strain and the heat, Wilson said he has no regrets
about making the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out the real strength you need is in your heart and
spirit. It's the cause that's driving you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dot Walsh alternately steers the caisson and walks. She has been
involved with the Peace Abbey since 1988. Noting the world is
nearing the end of a century of wars, she said this is a fitting
time in history for such a memorial. As a mother and grandmother,
she said, she is bothered by the numbers of children killed in
wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible journey of faith,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Goodnow, 60, is pulling the stone all the way to Arlington.
As he helped pull the caisson through Pennsylvania one hot day this
past week, not one bead of sweat rolled down his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cakewalk compared to what has happened to the
civilians in war-torn towns,'' he said. ``I feel no pain, heat or
discomfort from the journey at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodnow, who did not serve in the armed forces, said the stone
has great meaning to the veterans he knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistics indicate that 90 percent of all (war) casualties
are civilians,'' he said. ``The voices of the voiceless are
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodnow said that civilian deaths are often reduced to the term
``collateral damage,'' which appalls him
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were my brother or daughter or wife, I wouldn't want
them called that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group takes breaks as needed, and typically there is a
moment of silence before they start up again. People often stare at
them from their front porches. They sometimes snap pictures and ask
what they're doing. Some briefly join them.
</P>
<P>
   Randa noticed three teenagers join in. ``This is how it
happens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group struggled to get the stone up the hills in this rural
Pennsylvania town. They pulled, pushed, leaned on the caisson _
whatever way works. With red faces, sweat pouring down their neck
and backs, they made it up and took a break.
</P>
<P>
   Gulping bottles of water, some looked like they were trying to
ignore the heat. Drivers stopped behind them peered out of their
windows as they tried to figure out what was going on. One
passenger swore they'd die of heat exhaustion before reaching
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Randa said he decided that walking the stone would be the most
fitting way to deliver it as he recalled images of Kosovar refugees
leaving their country with all of their possessions on their backs.
In a way, this journey reminds Randa of them, although he admits
``the safety of American soil'' certainly makes this trip less
harrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``How it gets there is what's important, not just getting it
there,'' he said. ``The journey is not meant to be easy.''

<P>
   VALLEY TOWNSHIP, Pa. _ It's a strange caravan that moves along
the country road on a scorching hot summer day.
</P>
<P>
   A tan van leads the way with the words, ``Stonewalk, Veterans
for Peace,'' printed on its side. Seven men of varying ages are
behind it, hand-pulling a 2,000-pound tombstone on a caisson
decorated with an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   It is the 24th day of their 33-day mission to deliver the stone
honoring civilian war victims to an unknown site at Arlington
National Cemetery, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most fitting way to bring the memorial to
Arlington,'' said Karl Schlotterbeck, a project coordinator. ``It's
a struggle, but it shows our devotion to the cause and our concern
and anguish over the deaths of civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Stonewalk was organized by a peace group called the Peace Abbey
in Sherborn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The gray stone _ it's inscription reads ``Unknown Civilians
Killed in War'' _ was loaded onto the caisson in Sherborn on July
4. The 1-ton piece of granite had been unveiled there by Muhammad
Ali in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The group is scheduled to end its 485 mile journey at Arlington
National Cemetery on Aug. 6, the anniversary of the bombing of
Hiroshima. However, cemetery officials said they will not be able
to leave the stone in the cemetery. That would require
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   As a compromise, cemetery superintendent John Metzler spoke by
phone with Stonewalk organizers on Thursday and they agreed to
leave the headstone with a yet-to-be-designated embassy in
Washington. It is not clear what will then happen to the stone, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   White roses have been placed on top of the tombstone, which is
surrounded by the flags of all nations. Black and purple bunting
are on both sides of the caisson. Bottles of water, which provide
liquid relief in the blazing heat, are stored in the back under
more bunting of red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   During their journey, organizer Lewis Randa said they've
attracted as many as 25 volunteers in a single day. They have been
of varying ages and walks of life, including members of Scout
troops, veterans, children and police officers. A man in
Connecticut celebrated his 84th birthday by taking 84 steps pulling
the stone.
</P>
<P>
   As it passed near Valley Township this past week, the group was
down to seven volunteers. They began their day around 9 a.m. and
had been pushing and pulling ever since. The day usually starts
with breakfast. Trail mix and granola bars sustain them until their
next big meal in the late afternoon or early evening.
</P>
<P>
   Fair weather or foul, they walk every day. Rain has provided
relief only once, said Schlotterbeck, who has been associated with
the Peace Abbey for almost 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dennes (CQ) Wilson, 20, joined the group in Paoli, Pa. He'd read
about their mission and happened to see them chugging along through
his small community. They asked his family for a place to stay that
night and he went out with them that next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wilson did not plan to make the entire trek to Arlington,
he said that's partly why the mission is so amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, it's a trip of faith. You pull it through your own
community and someone from another community will replace you,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strain and the heat, Wilson said he has no regrets
about making the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out the real strength you need is in your heart and
spirit. It's the cause that's driving you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dot Walsh alternately steers the caisson and walks. She has been
involved with the Peace Abbey since 1988. Noting the world is
nearing the end of a century of wars, she said this is a fitting
time in history for such a memorial. As a mother and grandmother,
she said, she is bothered by the numbers of children killed in
wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible journey of faith,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Goodnow, 60, is pulling the stone all the way to Arlington.
As he helped pull the caisson through Pennsylvania one hot day this
past week, not one bead of sweat rolled down his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cakewalk compared to what has happened to the
civilians in war-torn towns,'' he said. ``I feel no pain, heat or
discomfort from the journey at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodnow, who did not serve in the armed forces, said the stone
has great meaning to the veterans he knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistics indicate that 90 percent of all (war) casualties
are civilians,'' he said. ``The voices of the voiceless are
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodnow said that civilian deaths are often reduced to the term
``collateral damage,'' which appalls him
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were my brother or daughter or wife, I wouldn't want
them called that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group takes breaks as needed, and typically there is a
moment of silence before they start up again. People often stare at
them from their front porches. They sometimes snap pictures and ask
what they're doing. Some briefly join them.
</P>
<P>
   Randa noticed three teenagers join in. ``This is how it
happens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group struggled to get the stone up the hills in this rural
Pennsylvania town. They pulled, pushed, leaned on the caisson _
whatever way works. With red faces, sweat pouring down their neck
and backs, they made it up and took a break.
</P>
<P>
   Gulping bottles of water, some looked like they were trying to
ignore the heat. Drivers stopped behind them peered out of their
windows as they tried to figure out what was going on. One
passenger swore they'd die of heat exhaustion before reaching
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Randa said he decided that walking the stone would be the most
fitting way to deliver it as he recalled images of Kosovar refugees
leaving their country with all of their possessions on their backs.
In a way, this journey reminds Randa of them, although he admits
``the safety of American soil'' certainly makes this trip less
harrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``How it gets there is what's important, not just getting it
there,'' he said. ``The journey is not meant to be easy.''

SHOOTING HIGHLIGHTS STRESS OF ON-LINE INVESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shooting spree carried out by a distraught Georgia investor
has focused attention on the high-stress world of people who play a
white-knuckle, high-stakes game of buying and selling stocks on
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With day trading, there's no quicker way to stare into the
abyss of your soul,'' said Joey Anuff, a San Francisco day trader
and author. ``A day trader's life is always about the deal they
missed, or a stock they got stuck with.''
</P>
<P>
   The police in Atlanta say Mark O. Barton, 44, opened fire in two
brokerage offices Thursday, killing nine people and wounding at
least 13 others. The police say Barton was concerned about
financial losses incurred through his investments.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who killed himself before the police could capture him,
also is believed to have beaten to death his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   Barton is a former chemist who had been trading shares full
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put an incredible amount of your money at risk day
trading,'' said Andrew Ross, an investor from Redwood Shores,
Calif. ``And when things go south, you can suffer incredible
losses, and just lose it, emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, professional stock brokers have buffered
individuals from daily stock market swings. But tales of windfall
profits and the ability to trade stocks on a personal computer have
sparked a rush of consumers into the stock market. Industry
estimates say individual traders can sometimes account for up to a
quarter of a day's stock market trades.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders try to build profits by buying and selling shares
based on the tiniest minute-to-minute fluctuations in stock prices.
These investors sometimes hold a stock for only a matter of
seconds, banking thousands on a stock moving up or down by pennies.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, a photographer who has been trading stocks on line for
more than a year, said the dizzying pace of day trading makes the
practice resemble gambling, with all its thrills and potential
pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly intoxicating to watch your money grow on your
computer screen,'' he said. ``And it's even more terrifying to
watch it shrink.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Anuff, author of the soon-to-be published ``Dumb
Money: Confessions of a Day Trader,'' the stresses of day trading
are immense: A typical trader will buy fluctuating shares, hold
onto it until the very last second, and then attempt to sell it
over the Internet, a fragile network that can crash during the
sale, sticking a trader with large losses. Compounding these
frustrations are the constantly updating Internet chat boards,
where rival traders crow about triumphs other traders missed.
</P>
<P>
   The budding industry was starting to wake up to the stresses of
day trading prior to the Georgia slayings.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the National Association of Securities Dealers
board approved a rule that would require on-line brokerage services
to screen customers to determine whether they are suited to the
lightning-fast daily trading style.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the Atlanta shooting, the on-line brokerage
ETrade in Menlo Park, Calif., issued a public statement saying it
was heightening security at its offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always taken significant steps to ensure (employee)
safety, including the deployment of state-of-the art security
systems at all of our campuses,'' the company said. ``Clearly, with
the incident today in Atlanta, there is heightened awareness of
security at all of our facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   But if day traders are a stressed group, they're also a tough
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the Atlanta shooting made the news, traders posted
messages on the Yahoo Web site, advising other day traders to buy
stock in gun lock manufacturers.

BROWN SAYS HE HAS RAISED $1 MILLION FOR RE-ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New because of Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE and GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown has amassed $1 million in
campaign cash, delivering a forceful challenge to anyone trying to
stand in the way of his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Brown disclosed Thursday that his campaign fund-raising machine
had piled up $1,049,633, an average of $250,000 per month from
March through June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions to Brown, the former speaker of the California
Assembly, cascaded in from city contractors, the real estate
industry, Hollywood and longtime political supporters in public and
private employee unions. Checks arrived from cities across
California and at least 21 other states.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the money that is already in the bank, the
mayor's bid for a second term in November will be augmented by
well-funded, volunteer-rich, get-out-the-vote efforts launched by
the Democratic Party and city labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Brown released the campaign finance report ahead of the Monday
filing deadline, while a handful of prominent Democrats ponder
mayoral bids of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Some interpreted the move as part of a strategy to persuade
potential competitors on both the political left and right to forgo
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates have until Aug. 6 to qualify for the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the mayor was trying to convey any specific
message to opponents,'' said P.J. Johnston, Brown's campaign
spokesman. ``However, serious contenders probably will have to take
a look at this and answer some hard questions about their ability
to catch up in this race.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Democrats known to be seriously weighing whether to run in
the Nov. 2 election, Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano and
Supervisor Leland Yee, said they wouldn't be intimidated by the
mayor's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I thinking David and Goliath here?'' Ammiano quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Yee said he thinks the mayor is going to have a hard time
erasing negative attitudes about his term, despite all the money at
Brown's disposal to reach the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Brown can raise all the money in the world. There is
enough information in the last four years to know what he is about.
No amount of money is going to change that perception. The question
is going to be whether San Franciscans want this type of mayor for
the next four years,'' Yee said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one candidate has formally challenged Brown, Clint Reilly,
a millionaire who is a former campaign consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls give Brown low ratings among voters, in
part because of dissatisfaction with his handling of the city's
troubled public transportation system.

 &HT;    U.S. EFFORTS TO INTERVENE IN BALKANS CONSUMING CLINTON FOREIGN
POLICY
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Aug. 1 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO _ The Balkans have a way of breaking the hearts of
optimists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a man can dream.
</P>
<P>
   And so came President Clinton, striding down the ramp of a giant
U.S. Air Force cargo jet on Friday, clutching the hand of Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, stepping into the morning sunlight at
the Sarajevo International Airport and bearing a grand vision of
hope and renewal for this most tragic and tortured of regions.
</P>
<P>
   As acts of faith go, it was a dramatic gesture, richly rewarded
with powerful symbols of the possibilities of peace in a city that
long stood for the hopelessness of war.
</P>
<P>
   Where soldiers once crouched behind sandbags and stood sentry
against Serb snipers and gunners in the surrounding hills, a
sparkling new air terminal stood ready to welcome the world.
</P>
<P>
   On a hilltop that was once part of a lethal no-man's land, two
young boys perched to watch the presidential motorcade wander out
of the airport and wind its way past apartment buildings with fresh
grey spackle plugging bullet-pocked walls.
</P>
<P>
   And all along the broad boulevard into town, a route so perilous
during Bosnia's 3 1/2-year-long war that it was dubbed ``sniper's
alley,'' small gaggles of well-wishers gathered and waved as the
president's limo whisked past in a dizzying blur of black gloss and
chrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace, Democracy and Prosperity are Our Hope and Our Goal,''
read a billboard erected by city officials. ``Europe for
Sarajevo,'' read the freshly painted mural on a bullet-riddled
wall, in a reference to Friday's Balkans summit here, attended by
Clinton and his counterparts from 40 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important day, and I would hope it is a very
proud day for the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' Clinton said.
``They've done a remarkable, astonishing job of rebuilding
Sarajevo.''
</P>
<P>
   To watch Clinton straining to put the best face on the rebirth
of a city still deeply scarred and badly reeling from the ravages
of war is to be reminded of the enormous stake he's placed,
politically and personally, in this often haunted region.
</P>
<P>
   No other major world leader has spent more time, taken more
risks nor vested more faith in the prospect of Balkans peace than
Clinton. He has sent thousands of American soldiers into harm's way
first to fight for and later to secure peace in Bosnia, Croatia and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, no other single issue -- not Russia, not China,
neither the global economy nor the reduction of nuclear weapons --
has captured the international agenda of the Clinton administration
like the business of trying to arrest a decade of Balkan turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   And, as things look now, no other single foreign policy issue
will be as central to Clinton's legacy as his struggle to end
bloodshed in the impoverished southern underbelly of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has even framed what many foreign policy analysts have
begun calling the ``Clinton Doctrine.'' More an expression of good
intentions, really, than a substantive policy guide, the so-called
``doctrine'' rests on the premise that the United States should
intervene militarily to avert humanitarian crises when it has an
interest in doing so and when it has the capacity to make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, has cast the
Kosovo crisis as a test of the nation's moral character that the
country simple couldn't afford not to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had America and our allies done nothing,'' Berger said in a
speech last week before the Council on Foreign Relations, ``we
would have faced history's judgment that the world's most powerful
alliance was unwilling to act when confronted with crimes against
humanity at its own doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   What's yet to be defined is a way to avoid interventions driven
by the cameras of CNN more than by any cold and sober calculus of
American interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans, in fact, have presented Clinton with a rolling set
of policy dilemmas and a constantly evolving drama of wrenching
failure and heady successes.
</P>
<P>
   No one could have predicted seven years ago, when Americans
elected Clinton to be the first president to lead their nation into
the promise and uncertainty of the post Cold War age, that this is
where his foreign policy legacy would so largely be forged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Balkans have loomed much larger in this presidency than
anyone would have intended,'' said Daniel Serwer, director of the
Balkans Initiative at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a
government-funded research and policy group in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in fact, has been criticized by some for devoting so
much time and effort to the Balkans, at the expense, these critics
charge, of issues that have greater potential to reshape the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of time and energy and effort that the Clinton
administration has put on the Balkans has just been
extraordinary,'' said Lee Hamilton, former chairman of the House
International Relations Committee. ``You obviously are not spending
huge amounts of time and effort on other areas that really are more
important when you think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, now director of the Woodrow Wilson Institute, a
Washington foreign policy think tank, took a generally dim view of
U.S. military intervention in the Balkans when he served in
Congress as a Democrat from Indiana. More broadly Hamilton, one of
Washington's most respected foreign policy voices, chafes at the
expenditure of vast amounts of political and diplomatic capital on
what he regards as issues of second-tier importance to U.S.
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the toughest problems that any American policymaker
faces,'' said Hamilton, ``is to keep his eye on the big
relationships and not be diverted from those relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has attached enormous weight to addressing humanitarian
crises that Hamilton regards as ``second tier,'' issues -- Bosnia,
Kosovo, Haiti and Somalia among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend so much time on these second-tier issues,'' said
Hamilton, ``and they come, in some ways, to dominate our policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's supporters insist that his attention to humanitarian
issues in general and the Balkans in particular has not sapped
undue resources from the post-Cold War imperatives he inherited.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said former Clinton foreign policy aide Jeremy Rosner,
his focus on core American ideals has served to strengthen the
country's position in the world and helped to strike a new balance
in U.S. relations with its European allies.
</P>
<P>
   Standing firm against ethnic atrocities in the Balkans, said
Rosner, has reinforced, not undermined, Clinton's wider goal of
broadening the base of democracies and free-market economies across
central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has really made a mark on central and southeast
Europe and trans-Atlantic relations more generally and even
Russia,'' said Rosner, vice president of Greenberg Quilan Research,
a Washington, D.C. polling and political consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Serwer, of the U.S. Institute for Peace, said Clinton has led
the call for a comprehensive international Balkans recovery program
because the bloodshed that has wracked the region since the breakup
of the former Yugoslavia began in 1991 has convinced him that
there's simply no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good investment, unless you think we can wash our hands
of the Balkans and walk away,'' said Serwer, former U.S. envoy to
Bosnia ``But that's the one thing we've never been able to do.''

IS THE NATION READY FOR A KING? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 01, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ That bald ex-wrestler in the feather boa and
the eye makeup gets headlines as Minnesota's third-party governor,
but the most effective independent operator in the political game
today may be a lanky, laid-back, mustachioed technocrat up the road
in Augusta, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Angus King, a low-key independent in his second term,
operates under the national media's radar screen, plugging away at
the unglamorous chores that are every governor's daily lot. But
he's just added several notches to his belt as a pro-business
environmentalist, a light-handed but deft administrator, and a
consistent devotee of the middle way.
</P>
<P>
   Maine just won first-place bragging rights in the Children's
Rights Counil ratings as the best state for raising kids, based on
ao statistics. (Obviously, winter temperature was not a factor.)
And the decision King made last fall to reject the federal
government's adoption of the fuel additive MTBE was ratified when
the federal advisory panel acknowledged it harms underground water
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to win one every now and then,'' said the governor.
He won another when the feds approved dismantling of the Edwards
Dam that had interrupted the flow of the Kennebec River for 162
years.
</P>
<P>
   So in addition to the clam strips and the lobstah salad, Maine
is on a roll this year. King's businesslike approach, short on
ideology and long on compromise, goes down well in Maine, which 20
years ago had another independent governor, Jim Longley. With two
Democrats in the US House and two Republicans in the Senate, power
depends on persuading people toward the middle. Senators Olympia
Snowe and Susan Collins are moderates who opposed impeachment and
favor compromise with the Clinton White House in the current tax
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the other 49 governors, King's popularity is high
because of the strong economy. Unlike the attention-grabbing Jesse
Ventura, the only other independent governor, King is a stranger to
the talk show circuit in D.C. He's ruled out running for the
Senate, and concentrates on his day-to-day tasks. Other than
drought, he faces a serene summer.
</P>
<P>
   About the only things going the wrong way were the van that ran
over prized mystery author Stephen King, now recuperating, and the
Portland Sea Dogs, the minor league ball club that cavorts on a
lovely little ballpark downtown. Through Thursday the Dogs were
winless in eight. As elsewhere, the economy hums, and anyone who
wants work can find it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's Maine Sunday Telegram carried 25 pages of
help-wanted ads. There are $8-an-hour jobs going begging. Employers
will fit jobs to your schedule. Sunday River is the latest resport
operator to recruit help abroad; The ski operator is hiring in
Australia to augment last year's 1,300 hires.
</P>
<P>
   Summer traffic on the Maine Turnpike is up 7 percent over last
year, triggering six- and seven-mile-long Saturday traffic jams at
the Hampton, N.H., tolls and the pike entry. Traffic is an issue;
the turnpike will be widened to six lanes from four in the 30 miles
between York and Scarborough. Meanwhile, some old-line industrial
jobs in shoes, chicken-plucking, papermaking, and timber melt away.
The new jobs are in call centers, tourism, and high-tech. Fishing
has been badly hit because of declining stocks, but tourism filled
that gap.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to fishing for votes, there seems to be a
slight uptick in the fortunes of third-party candidates in New
England. Ventura may be the poster boy for the corporate media
crew. But in addition to King, there is popular US Representative
Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the peppery lefty who is the only
independent in the House, and Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a way-to-the-right conservative, just walked out of the
GOP over beefs about philosophy, guns, abortion, etc. ``I'm the
most reliable Republican in the Senate, you could look it up,''
said Smith as he bailed from what he sees as a rootless passel of
accommodators.
</P>
<P>
   Smith will now take his quixotic _ maybe it's more Sancho
Panza-tic _ presidential campaign into the third-party route. Ross
Perot got 18 percent in '92, half that in '96, and just lost
control over his self-financed Reform Party to Ventura, who's
shopping for a presidential candidate to spend the $12.5 million
available in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else except the majorities in Congress, the Reform
Party is for campaign finance reform and a balanced budget. But,
like the Green Independent Party, which functions as a spoiler in
Maine, the Reformers find it hard to get their cantankerous
membership to follow anywhere in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's Greens last fall promoted nearly 30,000 votes for their
gubernatorial candidate, Pat LaMarche, and they bang away at King
for being insufficiently reformist. But after a decade or more of
big money corrupting the political process in Washington, Maine
voters seem happy to take what they've got for officeholders.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when Congress disemboweled its procedures in a
fruitless impeachment bid, then refused to back the Kosovo air
campaign spearheaded by American air crews, and refuses to do
anything sensible about gun control, no matter how frequent the
firearms massacres, the third-party route looks promising. Cowed by
the NRA and whipped to a froth by the Religious Right, the Sunbelt
conservatives running Congress gave us after the Littleton
shootings a law suggesting we post the Ten Commandements in every
public school. If that's your idea of suitable action, then you
should feel just fine about the current impasse in D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ventura, the Perot crowd, and the disillusioned
everywhere want a third-party candidate for president with a proven
track record as governor, they can do better than Donald Trump
(number two in the Reform Party convention delegate poll, if you
can believe it). They could look to Angus King, who packs no
ideology in his kit bag. Can America be finally ready for a King?

SPEARS IS ROYALTY AMONG TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Britney Spears is the reigning Queen of Teen.
</P>
<P>
   In her music videos, Spears is 17 going on about 28, the
provocative little Lolita with one button too many undone on her
Catholic school uniform, overly made-up and a look in her eyes
that's a bit too knowing.
</P>
<P>
   She's been accused of lying about her age and having plastic
surgery. She's been subjected to all manner of sniping that goes
with instant fame and riches. Her debut album, ``Baby One More
Time,'' has sold 5 million copies with no sign of slowing down. A
concert at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland was sold out Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Spears, who is from Edgewood, La., population 1,200, seems like
the poster child for a packaged teen act, which she may well be.
But in reality, in person, up close, she really is just a kid. Her
forehead has a patch of acne cleverly covered by makeup. She talks
in a soft voice, with an evident Southern drawl. She's amazingly
courteous to the 250 fans lucky enough to be chosen to receive
autographs during her hourlong appearance on stage under the hot
sun. And even she is a bit baffled by the cyclone of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has all happened so fast I haven't even really been able
to catch my breath,'' a smiling Spears said between autographs.
``To tell you the truth, I don't really know what to make of all
this, except that I'm extremely grateful and I certainly realize
how lucky I am.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Spears is down home enough to admit to sweating like a
horse in her tour sponsor's quilted vest, part of her chosen
ensemble, there were some indications that she wasn't quite like
the average 17-year-old _ like when she spoke of missing her
brand-new white Mercedes convertible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been home enough to drive it,'' she sighed. ``Maybe
once the tour's done and I get out of the studio I'll be able to
spend some time behind the wheel.''

AUSTIN, Texas: `` ... playing in.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was a New Yorker named Ronald Clyde Crosby, but by the time
he arrived in Texas for keeps in 1971, he was vagabond singer Jerry
Jeff Walker and widely known for a wastrel's tale of a wino and his
dead dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Bojangles'' was inspired by one of Jerry Jeff's recurring
visits to the nation's jails, this time in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   His long-suffering friends called him Jacky Jack Doubletrouble,
and for years he wandered around in a crazy daze, rarely sleeping
and growing surly when others did, recounts Larry King in ``None
but a Blockhead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His main hobby was causing riots,'' King asserts, recalling
the time Jacky Jack walked into a motel room full of drunken
cowboys during an Oklahoma rodeo and inspired them to beat him half
to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Jeff looked up from the floor, while dripping blood and
surrounded by broken furniture, and sneered: `Y'all ain't so
bleepin' tough. I been beat up worse than this by motorcycle
gangs.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his hard-core carousing, or maybe because of it, Jerry
Jeff Jacky Jack was a leader in the musical revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, an Austin writer and music publicist, describes a 1972
album, recorded in a primitive downtown Austin studio, as a
declaration of Walker's musical independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Austin, he found a creative community that let him mix
folk, rock, country, and anything else that caught his ear,'' Davis
wrote in a 1998 profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with fellow Austinites like Willie Nelson, Asleep at the
Wheel and Michael Martin Murphey, he became one of the arbiters of
the `progressive country' movement of the mid-1970s.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Walker and a handful of ``outlaws'' were
resisting Nashville's stranglehold on C&AMP;W music, and succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to get the first independent record deals and use
our own bands,'' he says today. ``We were trying to break the mold,
and we didn't mind if our records were a little rough.''
</P>
<P>
   The term they used at the time was ``ragged but right,'' Walker
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means we were winging it, catching the spark and the
camaraderie and bringing it off in an offhanded manner as opposed
to the slick layered sound of Nashville.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis recalls that in 1973, when Jerry Jeff arrived at the
famous Hill Country saloon in Luckenbach to record ``Viva
Terlingua,'' his collection of free-lance Austin pickers had
coalesced into the Lost Gonzo Band.
</P>
<P>
   ``A celebrated ensemble in their own right, the Gonzos would
flesh out Jerry Jeff's songs and enthrall audiences for the next
four years and four more albums,'' Davis wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry Jeff's Mad Dog tendencies were becoming the stuff of
legends. If he did show up for a concert date, he wasn't always
sure what town he was in.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Blockhead,'' Larry King remembers the night at Austin's
Castle Creek Saloon when Jerry Jeff stumbled on stage three hours
late and was greeted by catcalls and obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Jeff gave as good as he got and then some,'' King says.
``When he wearied of cussing, he grabbed a live armadillo from a
bystander and flung it toward ringside tables.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he snatched the microphone and invited everyone to come
onstage and fight.
</P>
<P>
   Some did.
</P>
<P>
   After order was restored, Walker began singing, through a split
lip, a dirty little ditty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halfway through it, he began to stagger backward and didn't
stop until he'd crushed his poor drummer's equipment to
smithereens,'' King says. ``He lay there, snoring, while management
churlishly chunked refunds and caught abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their many successes, that scene could be the trademark
of the Mad Dog Seventies.

AUSTIN, Texas: `` ... of Aces.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some additional good did come from the Mexican madness. Gent
started his thinly disguised satire of the Dallas Cowboys, ``North
Dallas Forty,'' in Durango. He would finish it while staying with
Cartwright during his six-month Texas Institute of Letters
fellowship on the Dobie Ranch near Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Before the decade ended, this, too, would become a major
Hollywood movie, starring Nick Nolte. Nolte wasn't a Mad Dog, but
he acted like one, in the movie and in real life.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   As the Seventies opened, Willie Nelson was living in Nashville,
the so-called Music City, and had just penned a new song: ``What
Can They Do to Me Now?''
</P>
<P>
   Two days before Christmas 1970, he found out: His Tennessee home
burned down.
</P>
<P>
   Although the exact time period is a mite hazy, at some point
before leaving Nashville, Willie tried to kill himself, according
to a story Cartwright tells about his longtime boozing buddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went out one night and laid down in the middle of a
snow-covered road and waited for a car to come by and run him
over,'' Cartwright says. ``The car didn't come by, so he didn't get
run over.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie had had it with Nashville. He loaded up his guitar, his
family and his band, and headed to Austin, a couple of hours south
of his birthplace in Abbott. He soon found a second home at a hot
new rock/country music palace, Armadillo World Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Nelson and the Armadillo had united country
and rock, ropers and dopers, longhairs and rednecks.
</P>
<P>
   Texas audiences obviously were ready for Willie's rock-oriented
country music and thoughtful lyrics. He signed with Atlantic
Records, and in 1973 recorded his breakthrough album, ``Shotgun
Willie.''
</P>
<P>
   He followed that with ``Phrases and Stages,'' an even bigger
seller and a story in itself given the turbulent times in the
recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   With borderline indignation, Milner points out that Nashville at
the time was using its own bands and arrangements and ``making
everything sound the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie simply didn't fit that mold. Any mold, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told him they didn't want him to sing,'' Milner says.
``They said he was out of meter, that no bands could play with him.
He was out of meter, all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Sinatra and Crosby were out of meter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he'd have done like they told him in Nashville, he'd still
be up there in the hills writing songs,'' snorts Milner. ``There
would be no Willie.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Mad Dog Billy Joe Shaver, a Corsicana native, also was a
major player in the outlaw country movement, but less as an
entertainer than as a songwriter. Dave Ferman, the Star-Telegram's
pop music critic, points out that nine of the 10 songs on Waylon
Jennings' seminal 1973 LP ``Honky Tonk Heroes'' _ ``a defining
moment of the outlaw movement'' _ were Shaver's.
</P>
<P>
   During this period, the Texas music scene was at a pivotal
point, with a new breed of country musicians coming of age, Milner
writes in ``Confessions.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a generation ``young enough and sensitive enough in the
rocking Sixties to know that country music could be better if it
had more than three chords and delved deeper with its lyrics than a
minnow's plunge.''
</P>
<P>
   That special ingredient, Milner says, was provided by the music
and the presence of Willie Nelson and his ``family'' of band
members.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Nelson recorded ``Red Headed Stranger'' for Columbia.
It was a country concept album that stunned just about everyone by
yielding a pop hit, ``Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, RCA packaged some older Nelson material with songs
by Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter and Tompall Glaser on one disc,
``Wanted: The Outlaws.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It became the first million-selling country album and sparked
a musical revolution,'' recalls Nelson biographer John T. Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Milner put it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``His physical appearance, his tolerance for sincere ideas
coming from all directions, even his progressive ideas regarding
certain mind-altering potions _ caused Willie to be seen as a
rebel, and this appealed to the young rock and roll crowd. And,
amazingly, it didn't turn away his older fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Milner was at the center of the revolution with Willie and
others and chronicled those ``exhilarating times'' for various
publications. He also published the programs for Nelson's
rollicking Fourth of July picnics.
</P>
<P>
   ``... It was _ looking back on it _ inevitable that Shrake,
Cartwright and the other writers I knew were becoming friends with
the Austin-based picker poets _ Willie and Jerry Jeff in
particular,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was inevitable because they were all cut from the same
cloth.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter recently asked Shrake what it was that brought the
writers and singers together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whiskey,'' grinned Shrake. ``We were playing in the same
joints they were playing in.''

AUSTIN, Texas: ``Fast Copy.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back home, Willie, Waylon, Jerry Jeff and a handful of Texas
songwriters such as Billy Joe Shaver, Townes Van Zandt and Ray
Wylie Hubbard were making serious sounds in and out of Texas. It
was Hubbard who gave the rebel movement its unofficial anthem, ``Up
Against the Wall, Redneck Mother,'' but it was Jerry Jeff's
recording that made it so wildly popular.
</P>
<P>
   Like King and Brammer, Milner had scratched out a meager living
with his writing through much of the previous decade. But he did
establish a good reputation as a journalism teacher at Texas
Christian University in the Sixties.
</P>
<P>
   By 1970, Milner was acting chairman of the Southern Methodist
University journalism department, rescuing a program that had
fallen on harsh times and was in danger of being discontinued. In a
risky move, he lured Pete Gent and Brammer to Dallas for part-time
teaching duties, and, of course, the students loved them.
</P>
<P>
   Within a short time, SMU was sweeping many of the major student
journalism awards in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Less successful but probably more entertaining were Milner's
later ventures: starting up a well-received but ill-fated country
and western magazine and promoting the rise of C&AMP;W's newest
superstar, Willie Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Careerwise, things were looking up for Larry King in the
Seventies even before the staggering financial success of ``The
Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,'' which was based on an article he
wrote for ``Playboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a college dropout, he suddenly found himself in high
demand as a teaching fellow at such lofty institutions as Harvard,
Princeton and Duke.
</P>
<P>
   King earned a National Book Award nomination in 1972 for
``Confessions of a White Racist'' and won the Stanley Walker
Journalism Award in 1973 for one of his magazine articles.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Whorehouse'' success would one day make him a millionaire.
It also freed him from the demands of the ``magazine treadmill,''
and he since has penned several plays, including Texas-based ``The
Night Hank Williams Died'' and ``The Golden Shadows Old West
Museum,'' scripted from an award-winning short story by Mike
Blackman, the former editor of the ``Fort Worth Star-Telegram,''
now free-lancing in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Austin, Cartwright and Shrake were as busy as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright followed ``The Hundred Yard War'' with the
fictionalized ``Thin Ice'' in 1972 and hit his stride in 1979 with
``Blood Will Tell,'' the second of four books on the Cullen Davis
murder case in Fort Worth. The 1997 ABC miniseries based on his
book starred Peter Strauss as Cullen and Heather Locklear as his
estranged wife, Priscilla, and appeared in reruns last month.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after 1982's ``Confessions of a Washed-Up Sportswriter,''
Cartwright took another shot at true crime in 1984 with ``Dirty
Dealing,'' the story of El Paso's star-crossed Chagra family and
the murder of a federal judge in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   In the Seventies, Shrake was researching a book on Willie
Nelson, but that biography would emerge some years later. His
published books at the time included ``Strange Peaches'' (1972) and
``Peter Arbiter'' (1973).
</P>
<P>
   Shrake also was churning out screenplays, two of which were
produced in the early '70s. The first, co-written with Cartwright,
was ``J.W. Coop'' and starred Cliff Robertson as an aging rodeo
cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was ``Dime Box,'' which staggered to the screen as
``Kid Blue'' in 1973 despite an invasion by a gaggle of Mad Dogs
who arrived on the film set in Mexico in a van driven by Shrake and
a Winnebago driven by Pete Gent. This would become yet another
benchmark adventure in the checkered history of Mad Dog Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, both vehicles, decorated with signs
proclaiming ``Mad Dog Production Company,'' reached Durango
overflowing with felonious pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, you didn't have a drug problem until you ran out,''
Shrake recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kid Blue'' starred Dennis Hopper, still riding high from the
stunning success of ``Easy Rider'' and himself seemingly on a
collision course with chemical suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Hopper, Mexico and the Mad Dogs were a mercurial mix and, in
time, remarkably productive despite themselves. Before the filming
of ``Kid Blue'' ran its woozy course, substantially over budget
because of Mad Dog shenanigans, Shrake, Cartwright and Gent had
recruited Hopper and film director Marvin Schwarz as full-fledged
Dogs. The membership swelled with the inclusion of cast members
Peter Boyle, Warren Oates, Howard Hesseman and Janice Rule.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on one's tolerance for decadence and depravity,
Cartwright's account of the filming of ``Kid Blue'' may be as
comical as anything he's written.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Hopper's career was almost wrecked during the craziness
that swallowed Durango,'' Cartwright reported.
</P>
<P>
   Just why so many Mad Dogs were in Durango for the filming is a
bit of a mystery, although Cartwright would claim that he and
Shrake were writing a screenplay for Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   And, in fact, 20 years later, CBS produced a version of the
Durango script as a made-for-TV movie, ``Pair of Aces.'' Kris
Kristofferson and Willie Nelson landed the leading roles.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a year later there was a sequel, ``Another Pair of
Aces.''

much, slept too little, womanized incessantly, and frittered away
days and nights with mind-bending chemicals. They called themselves
``Mad Dogs,'' and they embraced the image with the passion of
mildly deranged journalists and musicians, which they were. Yet
this handful of writers and ``picker poets'' created a significant
body of work, influenced a generation of Texas artists, and changed
for all time the state's music and literary landscape. By MIKE

TEXAS WRITERS AND MUSICIANS HELPED DEFINE THE SIXTIES AND
SEVENTIES 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE COCHRAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As recounted by Jay Milner in his lively memoir,
``Confessions of a Maddog,'' the turbulent Sixties was a pivotal
decade for his so-called rabble of Texas writers and musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Milner himself returned to Texas in 1961, the same year Bud
Shrake left the ``Dallas Times Herald'' to write a sports column
for the rival ``Dallas Morning News.'' In 1964, Shrake hit the
journalistic big time, joining Dan Jenkins at ``Sports
Illustrated'' in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The two old Fort Worth cronies soon were socializing with some
of the country's best-known writers, among them George Plimpton,
James Dickey, William Styron and Norman Mailer.
</P>
<P>
   They also crossed paths on occasion with Texans Larry King and
Billie Lee Brammer and ``Harper's'' Editor Willie Morris, the
University of Texas alum who once edited the iconoclastic ``Texas
Observer.'' Morris abandoned Texas and his Mississippi homeland for
New York and wrote about all three in a splendid book, ``North
Toward Home.''
</P>
<P>
   During Morris' celebrated reign at ``Harper's,'' both King and
Shrake were regular contributors, King out of necessity, Shrake
simply showcasing his versatility.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shrake called his New York adventure ``exciting,'' he
soon soured on Manhattan and fled to Austin in 1968. He continued
his association with ``SI'' while writing books and screenplays.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Confessions,'' Milner marveled that Shrake ``somehow
churned out books, screenplays, as-told-to biographies and magazine
pieces _ regardless of the situation at home, the hour or how much
fermented liquid he had managed to swallow the night before.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrake wrote his first three novels in the Sixties: ``Blood
Reckoning'' (1962), ``But Not for Love'' (1964) and ``Blessed
McGill'' (1968).
</P>
<P>
   Back in Dallas, Gary Cartwright had jumped from the ``Times
Herald'' to the ``News'' and was working on his first book, ``The
Hundred Yard War.'' In 1968, after a brief fling as a columnist at
``The Philadelphia Inquirer,'' he said farewell to the newspaper
world and headed to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Brammer was struggling off and on, mostly off, with
a sequel to his masterpiece, ``The Gay Place,'' and living in a
once-elegant, now crumbling old house known as the Caswell Mansion.
Cartwright insists that Caswell Mansion was to Austin what Gertrude
Stein's salon at 27 Rue de Fleurus was to Paris in the Twenties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way station for intellectuals, artists, musicians,
writers, politicians and other power-trippers,'' he wrote in his
latest book, ``HeartWiseGuy.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, he said, the conversation at Brammer's was even
wittier than at Gertrude's, inspired as it was by pot, speed,
mescaline, acid and peyote.
</P>
<P>
   As the Sixties drew to a close, Willie Nelson and Jerry Jeff
Walker were not yet living in Austin, but they had been in and out
on several occasions and now were headed that way. They would be
followed in short order by other musicians. Cartwright, Brammer and
Shrake were in place, providing Austin a unique writers' colony.
</P>
<P>
   It was a volatile mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything just came together in Austin,'' says David McHam, a
University of Texas at Arlington professor and longtime observer of
the Texas music and literary scene. ``I think that's what happened
with this group. Texas was just waking up.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus was the stage set for the Mad Dog Seventies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the best times to be having a good time in
Austin,'' is the way Jerry Jeff put it.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   In ``Confessions,'' Milner hammers home evidence that it was the
Seventies when ``McMurtry and the other Mad Dogs blossomed into
stars that shone beyond the borders of the Lone Star State.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt McMurtry's national exposure got a tremendous boost
from the movie version of ``The Last Picture Show,'' which was
nominated for an Academy Award as Best Picture in 1971. It lost out
to ``The French Connection.''
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry opened the decade with ``Moving On'' and followed with
``All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers'' (1972), ``Terms of
Endearment'' (1975) and ``Somebody's Darling'' (1978).
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after the book come out, ``Endearment'' made it to
the big screen. With Shirley MacLaine, Jack Nicholson and Debra
Winger in the starring roles, it won the Oscar for Best Picture.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Dan Jenkins scored a winning touchdown of his own.
After two earlier works of nonfiction, he came out with the widely
and lavishly acclaimed 1972 novel ``Semi-Tough,'' which thrust
halfback Billy Clyde Puckett, teammate Shake Tiller, coach T.J.
Lambert and the ever-lovely Barbara Jane Bookman on an unsuspecting
public.
</P>
<P>
   That was but one of a long-running string of terrific reads that
included 1974's ``Dead Solid Perfect'' and 1976's ``Limo,'' which
he wrote with Shrake. On their heels would come ``Baja Oklahoma,''
``Life Its Ownself,'' ``You Gotta Play Hurt'' and ``Fast Copy.''

<P>
   He was a New Yorker named Ronald Clyde Crosby, but by the time
he arrived in Texas for keeps in 1971, he was vagabond singer Jerry
Jeff Walker and widely known for a wastrel's tale of a wino and his
dead dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Bojangles'' was inspired by one of Jerry Jeff's recurring
visits to the nation's jails, this time in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   His long-suffering friends called him Jacky Jack Doubletrouble,
and for years he wandered around in a crazy daze, rarely sleeping
and growing surly when others did, recounts Larry King in ``None
but a Blockhead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His main hobby was causing riots,'' King asserts, recalling
the time Jacky Jack walked into a motel room full of drunken
cowboys during an Oklahoma rodeo and inspired them to beat him half
to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Jeff looked up from the floor, while dripping blood and
surrounded by broken furniture, and sneered: `Y'all ain't so
bleepin' tough. I been beat up worse than this by motorcycle
gangs.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his hard-core carousing, or maybe because of it, Jerry
Jeff Jacky Jack was a leader in the musical revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, an Austin writer and music publicist, describes a 1972
album, recorded in a primitive downtown Austin studio, as a
declaration of Walker's musical independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Austin, he found a creative community that let him mix
folk, rock, country, and anything else that caught his ear,'' Davis
wrote in a 1998 profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with fellow Austinites like Willie Nelson, Asleep at the
Wheel and Michael Martin Murphey, he became one of the arbiters of
the `progressive country' movement of the mid-1970s.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Walker and a handful of ``outlaws'' were
resisting Nashville's stranglehold on C&AMP;W music, and succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to get the first independent record deals and use
our own bands,'' he says today. ``We were trying to break the mold,
and we didn't mind if our records were a little rough.''
</P>
<P>
   The term they used at the time was ``ragged but right,'' Walker
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means we were winging it, catching the spark and the
camaraderie and bringing it off in an offhanded manner as opposed
to the slick layered sound of Nashville.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis recalls that in 1973, when Jerry Jeff arrived at the
famous Hill Country saloon in Luckenbach to record ``Viva
Terlingua,'' his collection of free-lance Austin pickers had
coalesced into the Lost Gonzo Band.
</P>
<P>
   ``A celebrated ensemble in their own right, the Gonzos would
flesh out Jerry Jeff's songs and enthrall audiences for the next
four years and four more albums,'' Davis wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry Jeff's Mad Dog tendencies were becoming the stuff of
legends. If he did show up for a concert date, he wasn't always
sure what town he was in.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Blockhead,'' Larry King remembers the night at Austin's
Castle Creek Saloon when Jerry Jeff stumbled on stage three hours
late and was greeted by catcalls and obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Jeff gave as good as he got and then some,'' King says.
``When he wearied of cussing, he grabbed a live armadillo from a
bystander and flung it toward ringside tables.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he snatched the microphone and invited everyone to come
onstage and fight.
</P>
<P>
   Some did.
</P>
<P>
   After order was restored, Walker began singing, through a split
lip, a dirty little ditty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halfway through it, he began to stagger backward and didn't
stop until he'd crushed his poor drummer's equipment to
smithereens,'' King says. ``He lay there, snoring, while management
churlishly chunked refunds and caught abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their many successes, that scene could be the trademark
of the Mad Dog Seventies.

   Some additional good did come from the Mexican madness. Gent
started his thinly disguised satire of the Dallas Cowboys, ``North
Dallas Forty,'' in Durango. He would finish it while staying with
Cartwright during his six-month Texas Institute of Letters
fellowship on the Dobie Ranch near Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Before the decade ended, this, too, would become a major
Hollywood movie, starring Nick Nolte. Nolte wasn't a Mad Dog, but
he acted like one, in the movie and in real life.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   As the Seventies opened, Willie Nelson was living in Nashville,
the so-called Music City, and had just penned a new song: ``What
Can They Do to Me Now?''
</P>
<P>
   Two days before Christmas 1970, he found out: His Tennessee home
burned down.
</P>
<P>
   Although the exact time period is a mite hazy, at some point
before leaving Nashville, Willie tried to kill himself, according
to a story Cartwright tells about his longtime boozing buddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went out one night and laid down in the middle of a
snow-covered road and waited for a car to come by and run him
over,'' Cartwright says. ``The car didn't come by, so he didn't get
run over.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie had had it with Nashville. He loaded up his guitar, his
family and his band, and headed to Austin, a couple of hours south
of his birthplace in Abbott. He soon found a second home at a hot
new rock/country music palace, Armadillo World Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Nelson and the Armadillo had united country
and rock, ropers and dopers, longhairs and rednecks.
</P>
<P>
   Texas audiences obviously were ready for Willie's rock-oriented
country music and thoughtful lyrics. He signed with Atlantic
Records, and in 1973 recorded his breakthrough album, ``Shotgun
Willie.''
</P>
<P>
   He followed that with ``Phrases and Stages,'' an even bigger
seller and a story in itself given the turbulent times in the
recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   With borderline indignation, Milner points out that Nashville at
the time was using its own bands and arrangements and ``making
everything sound the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie simply didn't fit that mold. Any mold, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told him they didn't want him to sing,'' Milner says.
``They said he was out of meter, that no bands could play with him.
He was out of meter, all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Sinatra and Crosby were out of meter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he'd have done like they told him in Nashville, he'd still
be up there in the hills writing songs,'' snorts Milner. ``There
would be no Willie.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Mad Dog Billy Joe Shaver, a Corsicana native, also was a
major player in the outlaw country movement, but less as an
entertainer than as a songwriter. Dave Ferman, the Star-Telegram's
pop music critic, points out that nine of the 10 songs on Waylon
Jennings' seminal 1973 LP ``Honky Tonk Heroes'' _ ``a defining
moment of the outlaw movement'' _ were Shaver's.
</P>
<P>
   During this period, the Texas music scene was at a pivotal
point, with a new breed of country musicians coming of age, Milner
writes in ``Confessions.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a generation ``young enough and sensitive enough in the
rocking Sixties to know that country music could be better if it
had more than three chords and delved deeper with its lyrics than a
minnow's plunge.''
</P>
<P>
   That special ingredient, Milner says, was provided by the music
and the presence of Willie Nelson and his ``family'' of band
members.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Nelson recorded ``Red Headed Stranger'' for Columbia.
It was a country concept album that stunned just about everyone by
yielding a pop hit, ``Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, RCA packaged some older Nelson material with songs
by Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter and Tompall Glaser on one disc,
``Wanted: The Outlaws.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It became the first million-selling country album and sparked
a musical revolution,'' recalls Nelson biographer John T. Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Milner put it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``His physical appearance, his tolerance for sincere ideas
coming from all directions, even his progressive ideas regarding
certain mind-altering potions _ caused Willie to be seen as a
rebel, and this appealed to the young rock and roll crowd. And,
amazingly, it didn't turn away his older fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Milner was at the center of the revolution with Willie and
others and chronicled those ``exhilarating times'' for various
publications. He also published the programs for Nelson's
rollicking Fourth of July picnics.
</P>
<P>
   ``... It was _ looking back on it _ inevitable that Shrake,
Cartwright and the other writers I knew were becoming friends with
the Austin-based picker poets _ Willie and Jerry Jeff in
particular,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was inevitable because they were all cut from the same
cloth.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter recently asked Shrake what it was that brought the
writers and singers together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whiskey,'' grinned Shrake. ``We were playing in the same
joints they were playing in.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Back home, Willie, Waylon, Jerry Jeff and a handful of Texas
songwriters such as Billy Joe Shaver, Townes Van Zandt and Ray
Wylie Hubbard were making serious sounds in and out of Texas. It
was Hubbard who gave the rebel movement its unofficial anthem, ``Up
Against the Wall, Redneck Mother,'' but it was Jerry Jeff's
recording that made it so wildly popular.
</P>
<P>
   Like King and Brammer, Milner had scratched out a meager living
with his writing through much of the previous decade. But he did
establish a good reputation as a journalism teacher at Texas
Christian University in the Sixties.
</P>
<P>
   By 1970, Milner was acting chairman of the Southern Methodist
University journalism department, rescuing a program that had
fallen on harsh times and was in danger of being discontinued. In a
risky move, he lured Pete Gent and Brammer to Dallas for part-time
teaching duties, and, of course, the students loved them.
</P>
<P>
   Within a short time, SMU was sweeping many of the major student
journalism awards in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Less successful but probably more entertaining were Milner's
later ventures: starting up a well-received but ill-fated country
and western magazine and promoting the rise of C&AMP;W's newest
superstar, Willie Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Careerwise, things were looking up for Larry King in the
Seventies even before the staggering financial success of ``The
Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,'' which was based on an article he
wrote for ``Playboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a college dropout, he suddenly found himself in high
demand as a teaching fellow at such lofty institutions as Harvard,
Princeton and Duke.
</P>
<P>
   King earned a National Book Award nomination in 1972 for
``Confessions of a White Racist'' and won the Stanley Walker
Journalism Award in 1973 for one of his magazine articles.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Whorehouse'' success would one day make him a millionaire.
It also freed him from the demands of the ``magazine treadmill,''
and he since has penned several plays, including Texas-based ``The
Night Hank Williams Died'' and ``The Golden Shadows Old West
Museum,'' scripted from an award-winning short story by Mike
Blackman, the former editor of the ``Fort Worth Star-Telegram,''
now free-lancing in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Austin, Cartwright and Shrake were as busy as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright followed ``The Hundred Yard War'' with the
fictionalized ``Thin Ice'' in 1972 and hit his stride in 1979 with
``Blood Will Tell,'' the second of four books on the Cullen Davis
murder case in Fort Worth. The 1997 ABC miniseries based on his
book starred Peter Strauss as Cullen and Heather Locklear as his
estranged wife, Priscilla, and appeared in reruns last month.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after 1982's ``Confessions of a Washed-Up Sportswriter,''
Cartwright took another shot at true crime in 1984 with ``Dirty
Dealing,'' the story of El Paso's star-crossed Chagra family and
the murder of a federal judge in San Antonio.

   In the Seventies, Shrake was researching a book on Willie
Nelson, but that biography would emerge some years later. His
published books at the time included ``Strange Peaches'' (1972) and
``Peter Arbiter'' (1973).

   Shrake also was churning out screenplays, two of which were
produced in the early '70s. The first, co-written with Cartwright,
was ``J.W. Coop'' and starred Cliff Robertson as an aging rodeo

   Then there was ``Dime Box,'' which staggered to the screen as
``Kid Blue'' in 1973 despite an invasion by a gaggle of Mad Dogs
who arrived on the film set in Mexico in a van driven by Shrake and
a Winnebago driven by Pete Gent. This would become yet another

   Not surprisingly, both vehicles, decorated with signs

   ``Back then, you didn't have a drug problem until you ran out,''
Shrake recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kid Blue'' starred Dennis Hopper, still riding high from the
stunning success of ``Easy Rider'' and himself seemingly on a
collision course with chemical suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Hopper, Mexico and the Mad Dogs were a mercurial mix and, in
time, remarkably productive despite themselves. Before the filming

because of Mad Dog shenanigans, Shrake, Cartwright and Gent had
recruited Hopper and film director Marvin Schwarz as full-fledged

</P>
<P>
   Just why so many Mad Dogs were in Durango for the filming is a
bit of a mystery, although Cartwright would claim that he and
Shrake were writing a screenplay for Schwarz.

Durango script as a made-for-TV movie, ``Pair of Aces.'' Kris

much, slept too little, womanized incessantly, and frittered away
days and nights with mind-bending chemicals. They called themselves
``Mad Dogs,'' and they embraced the image with the passion of

TEXAS WRITERS AND MUSICIANS HELPED DEFINE THE SIXTIES AND
SEVENTIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As recounted by Jay Milner in his lively memoir,
``Confessions of a Maddog,'' the turbulent Sixties was a pivotal
decade for his so-called rabble of Texas writers and musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Milner himself returned to Texas in 1961, the same year Bud
Shrake left the ``Dallas Times Herald'' to write a sports column
for the rival ``Dallas Morning News.'' In 1964, Shrake hit the
journalistic big time, joining Dan Jenkins at ``Sports
Illustrated'' in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The two old Fort Worth cronies soon were socializing with some
of the country's best-known writers, among them George Plimpton,
James Dickey, William Styron and Norman Mailer.
</P>
<P>
   They also crossed paths on occasion with Texans Larry King and
Billie Lee Brammer and ``Harper's'' Editor Willie Morris, the
University of Texas alum who once edited the iconoclastic ``Texas
Observer.'' Morris abandoned Texas and his Mississippi homeland for
New York and wrote about all three in a splendid book, ``North
Toward Home.''
</P>
<P>
   During Morris' celebrated reign at ``Harper's,'' both King and
Shrake were regular contributors, King out of necessity, Shrake
simply showcasing his versatility.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shrake called his New York adventure ``exciting,'' he
soon soured on Manhattan and fled to Austin in 1968. He continued
his association with ``SI'' while writing books and screenplays.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Confessions,'' Milner marveled that Shrake ``somehow
churned out books, screenplays, as-told-to biographies and magazine
pieces _ regardless of the situation at home, the hour or how much
fermented liquid he had managed to swallow the night before.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrake wrote his first three novels in the Sixties: ``Blood
Reckoning'' (1962), ``But Not for Love'' (1964) and ``Blessed
McGill'' (1968).
</P>
<P>
   Back in Dallas, Gary Cartwright had jumped from the ``Times
Herald'' to the ``News'' and was working on his first book, ``The
Hundred Yard War.'' In 1968, after a brief fling as a columnist at
``The Philadelphia Inquirer,'' he said farewell to the newspaper
world and headed to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Brammer was struggling off and on, mostly off, with
a sequel to his masterpiece, ``The Gay Place,'' and living in a
once-elegant, now crumbling old house known as the Caswell Mansion.
Cartwright insists that Caswell Mansion was to Austin what Gertrude
Stein's salon at 27 Rue de Fleurus was to Paris in the Twenties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way station for intellectuals, artists, musicians,
writers, politicians and other power-trippers,'' he wrote in his
latest book, ``HeartWiseGuy.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, he said, the conversation at Brammer's was even
wittier than at Gertrude's, inspired as it was by pot, speed,
mescaline, acid and peyote.
</P>
<P>
   As the Sixties drew to a close, Willie Nelson and Jerry Jeff
Walker were not yet living in Austin, but they had been in and out
on several occasions and now were headed that way. They would be
followed in short order by other musicians. Cartwright, Brammer and
Shrake were in place, providing Austin a unique writers' colony.
</P>
<P>
   It was a volatile mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything just came together in Austin,'' says David McHam, a
University of Texas at Arlington professor and longtime observer of
the Texas music and literary scene. ``I think that's what happened
with this group. Texas was just waking up.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus was the stage set for the Mad Dog Seventies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the best times to be having a good time in
Austin,'' is the way Jerry Jeff put it.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   In ``Confessions,'' Milner hammers home evidence that it was the
Seventies when ``McMurtry and the other Mad Dogs blossomed into
stars that shone beyond the borders of the Lone Star State.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt McMurtry's national exposure got a tremendous boost
from the movie version of ``The Last Picture Show,'' which was
nominated for an Academy Award as Best Picture in 1971. It lost out
to ``The French Connection.''
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry opened the decade with ``Moving On'' and followed with
``All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers'' (1972), ``Terms of
Endearment'' (1975) and ``Somebody's Darling'' (1978).
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after the book come out, ``Endearment'' made it to
the big screen. With Shirley MacLaine, Jack Nicholson and Debra
Winger in the starring roles, it won the Oscar for Best Picture.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Dan Jenkins scored a winning touchdown of his own.
After two earlier works of nonfiction, he came out with the widely
and lavishly acclaimed 1972 novel ``Semi-Tough,'' which thrust
halfback Billy Clyde Puckett, teammate Shake Tiller, coach T.J.
Lambert and the ever-lovely Barbara Jane Bookman on an unsuspecting
public.
</P>
<P>
   That was but one of a long-running string of terrific reads that
included 1974's ``Dead Solid Perfect'' and 1976's ``Limo,'' which
he wrote with Shrake. On their heels would come ``Baja Oklahoma,''
``Life Its Ownself,'' ``You Gotta Play Hurt'' and ``Fast Copy.''

</P>
<P>
   When it comes to crazy stuff, the lakeside group reached at
least one unanimous conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best time to do it is when you're young,'' said
Walker. ``It's like going to New York. Was it exciting coming into
Manhattan? It was when I was young. ... One time we burned up three
limos.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright dreamily remembered one of his ``great New York
moments'' of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a snowy night and I'm taking a cab to Elaine's, and I
look over and there's this couple trudging through the deep snow. A
little short Greek guy and a tall black-headed woman. I realize
it's Aristotle Onassis and Jackie O., and I'm there in a cab and
waving at 'em as I go by.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm thinking, `Is this a great country or what?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Cartwright said, he and the other writers were
actually performing when out drinking and carousing, and at the
same time expending creative energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 30 or 40 years old, you've got a lot of creative
energy. I can write a lot better now than I could then, but I don't
have the creative energy I left on the dance floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Health problems disrupted Shrake's lifestyle at a much younger
age, but, like Walker, he got in his licks: ``When I quit the heavy
stuff and the whiskey, red meat and booze, I said, `Well, it wasn't
like you didn't get your share.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even Jerry Jeff conceded that while he wouldn't change much,
he's glad he got the craziness out of his system in his younger
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to spend my whole youth being real busy, and
then decide I want to go with some wild chick to Las Vegas and get
some coke and lock myself up in a room at 57 years of age.''
</P>
<P>
   His old picker pal is slowing down also.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Willie at 65,'' the 1998 ``Texas Monthly'' article,
Cartwright told of sharing a joint with Nelson in his bus, the
``Honeysuckle Rose,'' before a Thanksgiving holiday concert in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to be a hermit, but I'm better off staying out
here by myself,'' Willie told him. ``Too many temptations. In the
old days we'd stay in town after a gig and start drinking and
chasing women, and some of the band would end up in jail or
divorced.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when he started leaving right after each concert, often
driving his bus all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for the bus and this weed, I'd be at the bar
right now, doing serious harm to myself,'' he told Cartwright.
</P>
<P>
   So despite the good times and the many Mad Dog successes, there
is, if not full-time remorse, serious second thoughts and some
regret about the time and toll of those ancient wasted days and
nights.
</P>
<P>
   At the lake that sparkling spring day, Shrake touched on those
shadows of his life. ``I think about it a lot. There is no doubt in
my mind I could have done at least five more movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone brought up a segment in Cartwright's ``HeartWiseGuy'' in
which he relates a conversation with Shrake and Dennis Hopper
several years ago at Austin's Raw Deal, once one of the Dogs'
favorite watering holes.
</P>
<P>
   Shrake, who hadn't had a drink in years, confessed to his
friends: ``I wake up at three in the morning revisiting those
places and remembering our drunken adventures. Only now they don't
seem funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright told of the ``decadelong dead spot'' that blighted
his memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I must have been around in the Seventies and
Eighties,'' Cartwright said, ``because I see my name on books,
screenplays and magazine articles. But it's as though someone
mailed them to me in a box with no return address.''
</P>
<P>
   As the lakeside session ended that day, the sun dropped into the
hills that snuggle up to Austin, and the old Dogs began drifting
away, one by one, timetables to abide by. It was nothing like the
old days, and one could not help but recall a passage from
Cartwright's book. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I don't see that fills me with regret: all the work
that was never attempted because my body and brain were pickled in
the pursuit of ... that's the rub; I can't remember what I was
pursuing.''

</P>

<P>
   He said he always wanted to live beyond the boundaries. Like
Willie Nelson maintains, you pick a road and go for it. ``I don't
think Willie figures there was much he could change one way or
another,'' Walker said. ``He just took what's been given him and
made the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie's goal was to play music as long as he could, and he's
been able to do that, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I was going to have some fun,'' he continued. ``I
kept hearing stories about how they rip you off and take everything
away, and I said, `Well, I'm going to get my licks in before it's
done.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One of those licks, they recalled, occurred many years ago when
he and Willie were to share a stage in Chattanooga, Tenn. Susan
Walker and the Cartwrights arrived separately to help Jerry Jeff
celebrate his birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The only issue not in dispute about that night is that the cops
arrested Walker on stage and hauled him off to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jeff's story: Tired of flying, he bought a 1954 Lincoln,
which was so slow the trip took longer than expected. Or, possibly,
he took a ``short cut'' and got lost. Either way, he failed to make
the show on time but insisted on taking the stage anyway.
</P>
<P>
   That's when, where and why the cops got him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the few times I got thrown in jail when I wasn't
drinking,'' he claimed. ``I got arrested for being late.''
</P>
<P>
   Nodding, winking and scoffing, the lake crowd remembered it
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' said Susan Walker, smiling, ``you left out the part
about why you got lost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you weren't drunk, you were stoned,'' added Cartwright.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back to the hotel that night with Willie,'' Susan
said, ``and Willie called down to get him out of jail. He said,
`This is Willie Nelson,' and they hung up on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, they retrieved their wayward troubadour from
the drunk tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was on his birthday,'' Susan said, sighing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next day was my birthday,'' Jerry Jeff shot back, trying to
keep things in proper perspective.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the new Jerry Jeff looks and acts differently, he's
lost none of what biographer John Davis calls the ``unalloyed,
straightforward simplicity'' that has been the trademark of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of his music is still distilled one night at a
time, one stage at a time, from Maine to Malibu,'' insists Davis,
an Austin writer and publicist. ``... His music _ elastic,
unqualifiable, uniquely empathic _ has retained the power to touch
two generations of listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He remains one of America's musical landmarks.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   And then, they pointed out, there's Willie, who Cartwright
maintained is quite possibly the greatest who ever lived. At age
26, in a single week, Nelson penned three classics: ``Crazy,''
``Night Life'' and ``Funny How Time Slips Away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright pointed out that Patsy Cline's cut of ``Crazy''
eventually won an award as the most-played song on jukeboxes ever
and that Ray Price adopted ``Night Life'' as his theme song. What's
more, Faron Young's version of Nelson's ``Hello Walls'' sold more
than 2 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   After triggering a musical revolution, Nelson changed course
again with his ``Stardust'' album of pop standards that roosted on
the country charts deep into the Eighties.
</P>
<P>
   He invaded Hollywood, appearing in 30 movies, among them
``Red-Headed Stranger,'' ``Honeysuckle Rose,'' ``The Electric
Horseman,'' ``Songwriter,'' ``Thief,'' and ``Barbarosa.''
</P>
<P>
   During this period, he also cut records with such eclectic
talents as Julio Iglesias, Bob Dylan, Dolly Parton and Ray Charles,
and with country-and-western peers such as Kris Kristofferson, Ray
Price, Webb Pierce, Merle Haggard, George Jones, Waylon Jennings,
Faron Young and Hank Snow.
</P>
<P>
   Willie, his fellow Dogs concluded, has proved even to this day
that he is as adaptable as he is durable.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems only appropriate that a fellow Mad Dog, Shrake,
would collaborate with Nelson for ``Willie: An Autobiography,'' one
of three such projects that carried Shrake into the Nineties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bootlegger's Boy'' profiled Barry Switzer before his
tumultuous tenure with the Dallas Cowboys, and Shrake followed that
with a surprisingly hot seller, ``Harvey Penick's Little Red
Book,'' a golfer's guide to an improved game. He did all this while
pounding out screenplays and embracing his true love, novels.
Shrake's latest is set in Austin in the 1870s and will be out soon.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, there's Cartwright, who simply has become one of
the best magazine writers in America. Besides co-authoring an
occasional screenplay with Shrake, he has written seven books.
</P>
<P>
   In a ``Texas Monthly'' article last year, Cartwright told of
reminiscing with Willie Nelson about life's vagaries and how the
two old Dogs agreed that attitude is surely the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``However you want things to be, create them in your own mind,
and they'll be that way,'' Willie assured him.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was just back from the Bahamas, where, Cartwright
reminded him, 20 years earlier he had been thrown in jail for
smoking pot and banished from the island for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so happy to be free of that damned jail, he jumped off
the curb and broke his foot,'' Cartwright said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   The lakeside retrospective shifted off and on to Larry McMurtry,
and Walker compared McMurtry's books with Anthony Quinn's movies.
``He either made your favorite movie or your unfavorite,'' he said
of the actor. ``McMurtry had either hits or misses.''
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry's latest novel, ``Duane's Depressed,'' received some
excellent reviews, but in a recent interview, the enigmatic author
seemed less interested in literary notices about his 22nd novel
than with his ever-expanding bookstore in Archer City, which he
named Booked Up.
</P>
<P>
   In that interview with ``The Washington Post,'' he was described
as ``Texas' best writer.'' The article pointed out that in a recent
``New York Review of Books,'' Thomas Powers endorsed McMurtry as
``author of a longer stream of good novels than perhaps any man
since Anthony Trollope.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems certain is that McMurtry's long-running success
served both to underscore Texas as a worthy literary subject and to
inspire a generation of the state's up-and-coming writers, which
the Mad Dogs most assuredly were in the Sixties.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the conversation soon turned to Blackie Sherrod, the
``Morning News'' sports columnist for whom Shrake and Cartwright
once worked, and to their longtime colleague Dan Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up under Blackie,'' said Shrake, at the same time
confessing that they tried hard to keep their mentor in the dark
about most of their nocturnal activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't tell Blackie anything. It would be like going home
and telling your mother, `Mama, guess what I did last night?' We
were scared to death of Blackie.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright joked also that ``Jenkins wouldn't have anything to
do with us,'' but indicated that was only after he got rich and
famous and ``became a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   They laughed again at the reunion in 1987, the Austin affair
when Jenkins, Shrake, Cartwright and Larry King were immortalized
on Austin's Sixth Street ``Walk of Stars.'' Blackie pointed out
that Shrake, Cartwright and Jenkins all started out as
sportswriters but had gone on to loftier subjects such as dope
smuggling, chicken-fried steak and mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   Their lakeside banter that day turned to their aging
compatriots, most of whom were scattered around Texas and still in
hot pursuit of the killer phrase and perfect lyric.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins is back in Fort Worth, settling into a new home there
and putting the final flourishes on a Southwest Conference
remembrance. He also is working on another golf novel. His columns
still appear monthly in ``Golf Digest,'' and he continues to report
on the major tournaments for the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Just out to mixed reviews is his newest novel, ``Rude
Behavior,'' another bawdy romp with Billy Clyde Puckett and
friends. Jenkins calls it his favorite and some critics agree.
</P>
<P>
   Pronouncing it Jenkins' best and funniest work yet, David
Burgin, writing in Milwaukee's ``Journal Sentinel,'' described Dan
as a ``national treasure, one of America's great humorists.'' He
called his book a ``monument to courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Courage?
</P>
<P>
   ``It dares to tackle political correctness,'' explains Burgin.
``Jenkins doesn't just tackle it. He blitzes it, slams it to the
turf and then jumps on it about a hundred times as if to make
certain this disguised American evil, this national insecurity,
this tyranny of thought and language is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Shucks, said Jerry Jeff, Dan was doing the same thing 26 years
ago with ``Semi-Tough,'' his breakthrough novel: ``He didn't know
any better, so he broke all the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could probably be said about all the Mad Dogs. As the
century moves toward a close, they just keep on keeping on.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, Walker has produced 10 albums on his own independent
record label, Tried &AMP; True Music. The most recent, ``Cowboy Boots &AMP;
Bathin' Suits,'' was recorded at his second home in Ambergris Cay,
an island off the coast of the Central American country of Belize.
</P>
<P>
   Another album on his independent label will be released this
fall in conjunction with his autobiography, ``Gypsy Songman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read it yet,'' said Susan, Jerry Jeff's manager and
president of Tried &AMP; True. ``But Bud wrote the introduction, and
Jimmy Buffet is writing the foreward to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``... He tells it all, from the time he started hitchhiking out
of New York up until the time he started sending our children out
into the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In shorts, shades and straw hat, the new Jerry Jeff on this day
looks not at all like the old liquored-up, brawling outlaw who
spent many a night sobering up in rural America's finest drunk
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike many of his fellow Dogs, Walker, at 57, says there
may have been a trace of method in the old madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes the carousing, the drinking, gave me the
courage to do a few things I might have rationalized away in a more
sober moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew then what I know now, well, I don't know. I had my
chance, and this is the route I chose to take.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ One recent spring day, the co-founders of Mad
Dog Inc., Bud Shrake and Gary Cartwright, and longtime accomplice
Jerry Jeff Walker sat down with a visiting reporter for a glance
back at life its ownself.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Austin was asparkle under a cloudless sky, and the
occasional buzz of big and little boats drowned out the recurring
sounds of laughter as the trio revisited moments perhaps best
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Kerosene Caper in Texas and the Chattanooga
Birthday Blooper in Tennessee, and even a snowy Manhattan Moment
with Jackie O. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Walker, queen mother of the Mad Dogs, and Phyllis
Cartwright, a dedicated co-conspirator, filled in the blank spots,
of which there were many. It was Susan who helped rescue Jerry Jeff
from himself, while Phyllis did her dead-level best to keep
Cartwright from an early grave.
</P>
<P>
   Running jokes that day were threefold: the scarcity of hard
drinks in a hard-core crowd, the Dogs' new and subdued lifestyles,
and the disparity of recollections of the good old bad days.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Jay Milner's new book, ``Confessions of a Maddog,''
was getting warm reviews around Texas. It revived interest in the
aging Dogs, their triumphs and tribulations, and most of all, their
contributions to the state's literary and musical landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite its title,'' said ``The Texas Observer,'' ``the real
focus of `Maddogs' is not high times, but literary history: a
series of portraits of writers who comprise, if not a school of
writing, then at least an effervescence of the arts at a time and
place where it might have been least expected to rise. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Milner has given us, if not a perfect book, then a good story
well told _ which, after all, is the definition of a good book.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Milner's memory was substantially better than those
of the Mad Dog lake assemblage, which couldn't quite pin down when
and where the new wave of Texas artists came together.
</P>
<P>
   But the odds favor either the little Luckenbach saloon or
Austin's gone-but-ne'er-forgotten Armadillo World Headquarters,
which orchestrated and celebrated the shotgun wedding of rock and
country music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The musicians had a big advantage over the writers,'' Shrake
asserted, noting that they could work and party at the same time,
and most often did.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could get as drunk as they wanted and do all their work
out in public. For us to get anything done, we had to go someplace
that was at least semiprivate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the great riddles of our time. I can't imagine
how any of us got anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Mad Dog Inc. was obsessed with buying a town, a
fetish that could have proved as dangerous as it was dizzy. Still,
artists need a private colony in which to create.
</P>
<P>
   Recollected now as the Kerosene Caper, the target that long ago
afternoon was Theon, once a dot on the map north of Austin that
Cartwright swears could have been had for $65,000 or so.
</P>
<P>
   He and wife Phyllis and Shrake set out that day to buy Theon.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiations abruptly ended at the Squirrel Inn after Shrake
spiked his tea glass of Scotch with a handy pitcher of kerosene he
drunkenly identified as water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud kept saying, `This Scotch tastes awful,' '' Cartwright
remembers.
</P>
<P>
   The bartender rose to the occasion, announcing that goat milk
was an antidote for kerosene, which would seem to suggest folks at
the Squirrel Inn routinely quaffed kerosene by mistake. Just where
she found the antidote that day is also lost in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have drunk a gallon of goat milk,'' Shrake grumped.
</P>
<P>
   Shrake survived, but barely. The three left with no town, no
artist colony and no invitation to return. So much for good luck.
Driving back to Austin, they were pulled over by a state trooper.
Phyllis Cartwright would later claim she swerved to miss a rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   But the trooper was skeptical. It may have been the fragrant
blend of goat milk, kerosene and Scotch that gave them away. Or
maybe it was Cartwright's crude and blundered attempt to persuade
the officer to surrender his pistol.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any doubt in my mind that the trooper was going
to kill Cartwright,'' Shrake said.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, after a nasty little roadside encounter, all three
wound up handcuffed in the back seat of the cop car.
</P>
<P>
   They spent the night in jail, but not before summoning a legal
crony from an Austin bar who tried gallantly to barter their
freedom on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Shrake says the lawyer redeemed himself somewhat by smuggling
dope into his jail cell for the overnight stay.

<P>
   When it comes to crazy stuff, the lakeside group reached at
least one unanimous conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best time to do it is when you're young,'' said
Walker. ``It's like going to New York. Was it exciting coming into
Manhattan? It was when I was young. ... One time we burned up three
limos.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright dreamily remembered one of his ``great New York
moments'' of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a snowy night and I'm taking a cab to Elaine's, and I
look over and there's this couple trudging through the deep snow. A
little short Greek guy and a tall black-headed woman. I realize
it's Aristotle Onassis and Jackie O., and I'm there in a cab and
waving at 'em as I go by.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm thinking, `Is this a great country or what?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Cartwright said, he and the other writers were
actually performing when out drinking and carousing, and at the
same time expending creative energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 30 or 40 years old, you've got a lot of creative
energy. I can write a lot better now than I could then, but I don't
have the creative energy I left on the dance floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Health problems disrupted Shrake's lifestyle at a much younger
age, but, like Walker, he got in his licks: ``When I quit the heavy
stuff and the whiskey, red meat and booze, I said, `Well, it wasn't
like you didn't get your share.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even Jerry Jeff conceded that while he wouldn't change much,
he's glad he got the craziness out of his system in his younger
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to spend my whole youth being real busy, and
then decide I want to go with some wild chick to Las Vegas and get
some coke and lock myself up in a room at 57 years of age.''
</P>
<P>
   His old picker pal is slowing down also.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Willie at 65,'' the 1998 ``Texas Monthly'' article,
Cartwright told of sharing a joint with Nelson in his bus, the
``Honeysuckle Rose,'' before a Thanksgiving holiday concert in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to be a hermit, but I'm better off staying out
here by myself,'' Willie told him. ``Too many temptations. In the
old days we'd stay in town after a gig and start drinking and
chasing women, and some of the band would end up in jail or
divorced.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when he started leaving right after each concert, often
driving his bus all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for the bus and this weed, I'd be at the bar
right now, doing serious harm to myself,'' he told Cartwright.
</P>
<P>
   So despite the good times and the many Mad Dog successes, there
is, if not full-time remorse, serious second thoughts and some
regret about the time and toll of those ancient wasted days and
nights.
</P>
<P>
   At the lake that sparkling spring day, Shrake touched on those
shadows of his life. ``I think about it a lot. There is no doubt in
my mind I could have done at least five more movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone brought up a segment in Cartwright's ``HeartWiseGuy'' in
which he relates a conversation with Shrake and Dennis Hopper
several years ago at Austin's Raw Deal, once one of the Dogs'
favorite watering holes.
</P>
<P>
   Shrake, who hadn't had a drink in years, confessed to his
friends: ``I wake up at three in the morning revisiting those
places and remembering our drunken adventures. Only now they don't
seem funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright told of the ``decadelong dead spot'' that blighted
his memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I must have been around in the Seventies and
Eighties,'' Cartwright said, ``because I see my name on books,
screenplays and magazine articles. But it's as though someone
mailed them to me in a box with no return address.''
</P>
<P>
   As the lakeside session ended that day, the sun dropped into the
hills that snuggle up to Austin, and the old Dogs began drifting
away, one by one, timetables to abide by. It was nothing like the
old days, and one could not help but recall a passage from
Cartwright's book. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I don't see that fills me with regret: all the work
that was never attempted because my body and brain were pickled in
the pursuit of ... that's the rub; I can't remember what I was
pursuing.''

<P>
   He said he always wanted to live beyond the boundaries. Like
Willie Nelson maintains, you pick a road and go for it. ``I don't
think Willie figures there was much he could change one way or
another,'' Walker said. ``He just took what's been given him and
made the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie's goal was to play music as long as he could, and he's
been able to do that, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I was going to have some fun,'' he continued. ``I
kept hearing stories about how they rip you off and take everything
away, and I said, `Well, I'm going to get my licks in before it's
done.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One of those licks, they recalled, occurred many years ago when
he and Willie were to share a stage in Chattanooga, Tenn. Susan
Walker and the Cartwrights arrived separately to help Jerry Jeff
celebrate his birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The only issue not in dispute about that night is that the cops
arrested Walker on stage and hauled him off to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jeff's story: Tired of flying, he bought a 1954 Lincoln,
which was so slow the trip took longer than expected. Or, possibly,
he took a ``short cut'' and got lost. Either way, he failed to make
the show on time but insisted on taking the stage anyway.
</P>
<P>
   That's when, where and why the cops got him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the few times I got thrown in jail when I wasn't
drinking,'' he claimed. ``I got arrested for being late.''
</P>
<P>
   Nodding, winking and scoffing, the lake crowd remembered it
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' said Susan Walker, smiling, ``you left out the part
about why you got lost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you weren't drunk, you were stoned,'' added Cartwright.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back to the hotel that night with Willie,'' Susan
said, ``and Willie called down to get him out of jail. He said,
`This is Willie Nelson,' and they hung up on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, they retrieved their wayward troubadour from
the drunk tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was on his birthday,'' Susan said, sighing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next day was my birthday,'' Jerry Jeff shot back, trying to
keep things in proper perspective.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the new Jerry Jeff looks and acts differently, he's
lost none of what biographer John Davis calls the ``unalloyed,
straightforward simplicity'' that has been the trademark of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of his music is still distilled one night at a
time, one stage at a time, from Maine to Malibu,'' insists Davis,
an Austin writer and publicist. ``... His music _ elastic,
unqualifiable, uniquely empathic _ has retained the power to touch
two generations of listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He remains one of America's musical landmarks.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   And then, they pointed out, there's Willie, who Cartwright
maintained is quite possibly the greatest who ever lived. At age
26, in a single week, Nelson penned three classics: ``Crazy,''
``Night Life'' and ``Funny How Time Slips Away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright pointed out that Patsy Cline's cut of ``Crazy''
eventually won an award as the most-played song on jukeboxes ever
and that Ray Price adopted ``Night Life'' as his theme song. What's
more, Faron Young's version of Nelson's ``Hello Walls'' sold more
than 2 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   After triggering a musical revolution, Nelson changed course
again with his ``Stardust'' album of pop standards that roosted on
the country charts deep into the Eighties.
</P>
<P>
   He invaded Hollywood, appearing in 30 movies, among them
``Red-Headed Stranger,'' ``Honeysuckle Rose,'' ``The Electric
Horseman,'' ``Songwriter,'' ``Thief,'' and ``Barbarosa.''
</P>
<P>
   During this period, he also cut records with such eclectic
talents as Julio Iglesias, Bob Dylan, Dolly Parton and Ray Charles,
and with country-and-western peers such as Kris Kristofferson, Ray
Price, Webb Pierce, Merle Haggard, George Jones, Waylon Jennings,
Faron Young and Hank Snow.
</P>
<P>
   Willie, his fellow Dogs concluded, has proved even to this day
that he is as adaptable as he is durable.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems only appropriate that a fellow Mad Dog, Shrake,
would collaborate with Nelson for ``Willie: An Autobiography,'' one
of three such projects that carried Shrake into the Nineties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bootlegger's Boy'' profiled Barry Switzer before his
tumultuous tenure with the Dallas Cowboys, and Shrake followed that
with a surprisingly hot seller, ``Harvey Penick's Little Red
Book,'' a golfer's guide to an improved game. He did all this while
pounding out screenplays and embracing his true love, novels.
Shrake's latest is set in Austin in the 1870s and will be out soon.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, there's Cartwright, who simply has become one of
the best magazine writers in America. Besides co-authoring an
occasional screenplay with Shrake, he has written seven books.
</P>
<P>
   In a ``Texas Monthly'' article last year, Cartwright told of
reminiscing with Willie Nelson about life's vagaries and how the
two old Dogs agreed that attitude is surely the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``However you want things to be, create them in your own mind,
and they'll be that way,'' Willie assured him.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was just back from the Bahamas, where, Cartwright
reminded him, 20 years earlier he had been thrown in jail for
smoking pot and banished from the island for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so happy to be free of that damned jail, he jumped off
the curb and broke his foot,'' Cartwright said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   The lakeside retrospective shifted off and on to Larry McMurtry,
and Walker compared McMurtry's books with Anthony Quinn's movies.
``He either made your favorite movie or your unfavorite,'' he said
of the actor. ``McMurtry had either hits or misses.''
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry's latest novel, ``Duane's Depressed,'' received some
excellent reviews, but in a recent interview, the enigmatic author
seemed less interested in literary notices about his 22nd novel
than with his ever-expanding bookstore in Archer City, which he
named Booked Up.
</P>
<P>
   In that interview with ``The Washington Post,'' he was described
as ``Texas' best writer.'' The article pointed out that in a recent
``New York Review of Books,'' Thomas Powers endorsed McMurtry as
``author of a longer stream of good novels than perhaps any man
since Anthony Trollope.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems certain is that McMurtry's long-running success
served both to underscore Texas as a worthy literary subject and to
inspire a generation of the state's up-and-coming writers, which
the Mad Dogs most assuredly were in the Sixties.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the conversation soon turned to Blackie Sherrod, the
``Morning News'' sports columnist for whom Shrake and Cartwright
once worked, and to their longtime colleague Dan Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up under Blackie,'' said Shrake, at the same time
confessing that they tried hard to keep their mentor in the dark
about most of their nocturnal activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't tell Blackie anything. It would be like going home
and telling your mother, `Mama, guess what I did last night?' We
were scared to death of Blackie.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright joked also that ``Jenkins wouldn't have anything to
do with us,'' but indicated that was only after he got rich and
famous and ``became a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   They laughed again at the reunion in 1987, the Austin affair
when Jenkins, Shrake, Cartwright and Larry King were immortalized
on Austin's Sixth Street ``Walk of Stars.'' Blackie pointed out
that Shrake, Cartwright and Jenkins all started out as
sportswriters but had gone on to loftier subjects such as dope
smuggling, chicken-fried steak and mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   Their lakeside banter that day turned to their aging
compatriots, most of whom were scattered around Texas and still in
hot pursuit of the killer phrase and perfect lyric.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins is back in Fort Worth, settling into a new home there
and putting the final flourishes on a Southwest Conference
remembrance. He also is working on another golf novel. His columns
still appear monthly in ``Golf Digest,'' and he continues to report
on the major tournaments for the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Just out to mixed reviews is his newest novel, ``Rude
Behavior,'' another bawdy romp with Billy Clyde Puckett and
friends. Jenkins calls it his favorite and some critics agree.
</P>
<P>
   Pronouncing it Jenkins' best and funniest work yet, David
Burgin, writing in Milwaukee's ``Journal Sentinel,'' described Dan
as a ``national treasure, one of America's great humorists.'' He
called his book a ``monument to courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Courage?
</P>
<P>
   ``It dares to tackle political correctness,'' explains Burgin.
``Jenkins doesn't just tackle it. He blitzes it, slams it to the
turf and then jumps on it about a hundred times as if to make
certain this disguised American evil, this national insecurity,
this tyranny of thought and language is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Shucks, said Jerry Jeff, Dan was doing the same thing 26 years
ago with ``Semi-Tough,'' his breakthrough novel: ``He didn't know
any better, so he broke all the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could probably be said about all the Mad Dogs. As the
century moves toward a close, they just keep on keeping on.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, Walker has produced 10 albums on his own independent
record label, Tried &AMP; True Music. The most recent, ``Cowboy Boots &AMP;
Bathin' Suits,'' was recorded at his second home in Ambergris Cay,
an island off the coast of the Central American country of Belize.
</P>
<P>
   Another album on his independent label will be released this
fall in conjunction with his autobiography, ``Gypsy Songman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read it yet,'' said Susan, Jerry Jeff's manager and
president of Tried &AMP; True. ``But Bud wrote the introduction, and
Jimmy Buffet is writing the foreward to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``... He tells it all, from the time he started hitchhiking out
of New York up until the time he started sending our children out
into the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In shorts, shades and straw hat, the new Jerry Jeff on this day
looks not at all like the old liquored-up, brawling outlaw who
spent many a night sobering up in rural America's finest drunk
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike many of his fellow Dogs, Walker, at 57, says there
may have been a trace of method in the old madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes the carousing, the drinking, gave me the
courage to do a few things I might have rationalized away in a more
sober moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew then what I know now, well, I don't know. I had my
chance, and this is the route I chose to take.''

``Mad Dogs,'' and they embraced the image with the passion of

   AUSTIN, Texas _ One recent spring day, the co-founders of Mad
Dog Inc., Bud Shrake and Gary Cartwright, and longtime accomplice
Jerry Jeff Walker sat down with a visiting reporter for a glance
back at life its ownself.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Austin was asparkle under a cloudless sky, and the
occasional buzz of big and little boats drowned out the recurring
sounds of laughter as the trio revisited moments perhaps best
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Kerosene Caper in Texas and the Chattanooga
Birthday Blooper in Tennessee, and even a snowy Manhattan Moment
with Jackie O. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Walker, queen mother of the Mad Dogs, and Phyllis
Cartwright, a dedicated co-conspirator, filled in the blank spots,
of which there were many. It was Susan who helped rescue Jerry Jeff
from himself, while Phyllis did her dead-level best to keep
Cartwright from an early grave.
</P>
<P>
   Running jokes that day were threefold: the scarcity of hard
drinks in a hard-core crowd, the Dogs' new and subdued lifestyles,
and the disparity of recollections of the good old bad days.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Jay Milner's new book, ``Confessions of a Maddog,''
was getting warm reviews around Texas. It revived interest in the
aging Dogs, their triumphs and tribulations, and most of all, their
contributions to the state's literary and musical landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite its title,'' said ``The Texas Observer,'' ``the real
focus of `Maddogs' is not high times, but literary history: a
series of portraits of writers who comprise, if not a school of
writing, then at least an effervescence of the arts at a time and
place where it might have been least expected to rise. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Milner has given us, if not a perfect book, then a good story
well told _ which, after all, is the definition of a good book.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Milner's memory was substantially better than those
of the Mad Dog lake assemblage, which couldn't quite pin down when
and where the new wave of Texas artists came together.
</P>
<P>
   But the odds favor either the little Luckenbach saloon or
Austin's gone-but-ne'er-forgotten Armadillo World Headquarters,
which orchestrated and celebrated the shotgun wedding of rock and
country music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The musicians had a big advantage over the writers,'' Shrake
asserted, noting that they could work and party at the same time,
and most often did.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could get as drunk as they wanted and do all their work
out in public. For us to get anything done, we had to go someplace
that was at least semiprivate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the great riddles of our time. I can't imagine
how any of us got anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Mad Dog Inc. was obsessed with buying a town, a
fetish that could have proved as dangerous as it was dizzy. Still,
artists need a private colony in which to create.
</P>
<P>
   Recollected now as the Kerosene Caper, the target that long ago
afternoon was Theon, once a dot on the map north of Austin that
Cartwright swears could have been had for $65,000 or so.
</P>
<P>
   He and wife Phyllis and Shrake set out that day to buy Theon.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiations abruptly ended at the Squirrel Inn after Shrake
spiked his tea glass of Scotch with a handy pitcher of kerosene he
drunkenly identified as water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud kept saying, `This Scotch tastes awful,' '' Cartwright
remembers.
</P>
<P>
   The bartender rose to the occasion, announcing that goat milk
was an antidote for kerosene, which would seem to suggest folks at
the Squirrel Inn routinely quaffed kerosene by mistake. Just where
she found the antidote that day is also lost in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have drunk a gallon of goat milk,'' Shrake grumped.
</P>
<P>
   Shrake survived, but barely. The three left with no town, no
artist colony and no invitation to return. So much for good luck.
Driving back to Austin, they were pulled over by a state trooper.
Phyllis Cartwright would later claim she swerved to miss a rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   But the trooper was skeptical. It may have been the fragrant
blend of goat milk, kerosene and Scotch that gave them away. Or
maybe it was Cartwright's crude and blundered attempt to persuade
the officer to surrender his pistol.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any doubt in my mind that the trooper was going
to kill Cartwright,'' Shrake said.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, after a nasty little roadside encounter, all three
wound up handcuffed in the back seat of the cop car.
</P>
<P>
   They spent the night in jail, but not before summoning a legal
crony from an Austin bar who tried gallantly to barter their
freedom on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Shrake says the lawyer redeemed himself somewhat by smuggling
dope into his jail cell for the overnight stay.

IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW IT ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK. Let's all be happy.
</P>
<P>
   That's a hard thing to do these days, but let's make an effort
anyway. Say it: ``I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now let's try that together on Aug. 8, the day the Secret
Society of Happy People would like to designate as ``National Admit
You're Happy Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the thought of a happy day gets me all worked up. It's the
same feeling I get when I pull my car into the driveway and see my
daughters spilling from the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy!'' they scream at the top of their voices. ``Mommy!''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes our reunion _ after just eight hours _ is so intense
that it takes me a half-hour to untangle myself and walk into the
house. I have a lot of moments like that, so full of happiness I
have to pinch myself.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not bragging. I believe, with Pam Johnson, that we don't
share enough of those moments with others.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is the founder of the Secret Society. She believes that
somewhere between the Ed Sullivan and Jerry Springer shows, our
conversations have lost the language of happiness; that we're more
receptive to listening to one another whine than to hearing about
the things that give us reason to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times this year that Jerry Springer had higher
ratings than Oprah,'' Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   To counter life's doom and gloom, Johnson started the happy
society a year ago, and more than 100,000 people have embraced its
message.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the first anniversary of the Secret Society and
encourage people to spread their cheer, the society is hoping the
governors of our 50 states will declare next Sunday ``National
Admit You're Happy Day.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the nation's governors haven't been too
receptive, which is why Johnson isn't entirely happy. When we
talked Monday, only 15 governors had agreed to declare Aug. 8 a
happy holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen earned Johnson's ``stick in the mud'' or ``parade
raining'' titles by denying the proclamation request. Fellow Texan
and presidential hopeful George W. Bush made Johnson's list of
``undecided'' governors.
</P>
<P>
   My first thought is, what harm would it do to ask your
constituents to be happy? It might seem like a small thing, but
sometimes in our rush to make ends meet, to get the kids to piano
lessons or to the next soccer game, we don't have time to explore
our feelings.
</P>
<P>
   There's no time, for instance, to enjoy a beautiful sunrise or
the smell of coffee perking or the kids laughing in the next room.
We take the little things our mate does for us for granted, and we
forget that there are small pleasures we can bring to their lives.
They don't cost anything. They just make the other person feel good
_ feel loved, feel happy.
</P>
<P>
   I can't recall a time when I didn't experience such moments,
however brief. even in the midst of pain, joy has been the center
of my being.
</P>
<P>
   I've always tried to be like the apostle Paul, content in any
situation. And like Job, knowing that we should not expect to
receive only good at the hand of God.
</P>
<P>
   I understand when Johnson says that she is not asking people to
go into denial. She knows there are times when happiness doesn't
seem possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't tell people to pretend to be happy,'' she said.
``But if you are happy, talk about it.''

PERSECUTED EARLY ENGLISH BAPTISTS MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, England _ One thing about England: It is full of
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   I'm here at Regents Park College, a part of Oxford University,
for three weeks of study about church history with a group of Texas
seminarians.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise came when I attended the New Road Baptist Church in
Oxford on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   During coffee after the service, professor Larry Kreitzer from
Regents Park College introduced me to a distinguished-looking
gentleman, Barrington R. White.
</P>
<P>
   I knew the man I was talking to was a retired Oxford professor.
He was full of wit and gladly answered several of my questions
about English Baptist beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   What I did not know, and learned later, is that White is
considered by many to be the greatest living authority on English
Baptist history.
</P>
<P>
   White is considered ``Mr. Baptist'' in England and is the
retired principal, meaning president, of Regents Park College,
where I am taking courses in a program led by faculty from
Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   A large painting of White looks down on me each day from the
front wall of Helwys Hall, the name of the refectory at the
college, where our meals are served each day.
</P>
<P>
   In my conversation with White, I asked him what contributions
English Baptists have made to the cause of religious liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've provided a lot of martyrs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he was not joking.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist movement as we know it, including the giant Southern
Baptist Convention in the United States, was created by dissenters
from established faiths in the early 1600s. And those early
nonconformists often paid with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Helwys, whom historians credit with establishing the
first Baptist church on English soil in the Spitalfield section of
London in 1612, died for his dissent in Newgate Prison. (He was not
executed but died in jail, where he was sent for defying state
church practices.)
</P>
<P>
   We know that people other than Baptists have died for their
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Just in front of Regents Park College is a monument honoring
three Anglican church leaders, including Thomas Cranmer, who were
burned at the stake.
</P>
<P>
   They refused to recant their allegiance to the Church of England
during the short and murderous reign of Mary Tudor, the Roman
Catholic daughter of Henry VIII.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 people were executed during the time of ``Bloody
Mary,'' including about 200 Anabaptists who, like later Baptists,
rejected infant baptism, said Karen Bullock, the Southwestern
Seminary professor who is teaching my Baptist history course at
Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics have had an even longer history of people martyred
because of their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist martyrs mainly died as a result of laws designed to
force compliance with Church of England practices.
</P>
<P>
   Baptists were not even allowed to attend Oxford University until
the 1680s. Regents Park College, founded in 1810, is the only
Baptist-related college connected to Oxford University.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge University, the chief rival of Oxford, allowed
Baptists to enroll much earlier, White told me.
</P>
<P>
   But White, ever loyal to Oxford, said there were strings
attached when Baptists were allowed to attend Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would not let them graduate until they became
Anglicans,'' he said. ``It was a dissenter trap.''
</P>
<P>
   During our days here, we are traveling to historic sites such as
the home of William Carey in Moulton. He is regarded as the founder
of the modern Baptist missionary movement.
</P>
<P>
   We visited the Bedford, England, home of John Bunyan, the writer
of ``Pilgrim's Progress.'' Also, we went to a church in Olney,
England, where John Newton, a former slave-ship captain, was an
Anglican priest.
</P>
<P>
   Near Newton's old pulpit, we sang what Newton wrote about God's
forgiving nature following Newton's conversion to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The words of ``Amazing Grace'' echoing through the ancient
church never had so sweet a sound.

HERE'S A DREAM JOB: GET PAID TO SAY HELLO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He could've been just another Wal-Mart shopper that day in
Crowley, La.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no ordinary customer. This was Sam Walton, the
legendary founder of the Arkansas-based chain, entering the store
with one of his executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, how are you, glad to see you,'' an old gentleman stationed
at the store's entrance said to Walton. ``If there's anything I can
tell you about our store, let me know.''
</P>
<P>
   That was nearly 20 years ago, says John Bisio, a Wal-Mart
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bisio adds, ``Mr. Walton was inspired by the idea and wanted to
expand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, at least one ``greeter'' _ usually a senior citizen _
works at each of the chain's 2,450 stores, and the concept is
catching on nationwide as businesses try to survive in a more
competitive marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a growing trend over the last several years,'' says
Scott Krugman, spokesman for the National Retail Federation in
Washington, D.C. ``It gives customers a good feeling as they walk
into the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Greeters range from senior citizens to young up-and-coming
managers to students working part time.
</P>
<P>
   At some restaurants, the greeters are former restaurant owners
who want to fulfill a need to be around people.
</P>
<P>
   Willis ``Mac'' McIntosh and Walter Kaufmann, both longtime Fort
Worth restaurateurs, say greeting customers gives them a chance to
stay in touch with the people they've met over the years and to
continue to be a part of the hustle and bustle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing with the restaurant business, you get addicted to
it,'' says Kaufmann, who is 70 and owned the Old Swiss House for 30
years. ``Playing golf is not that fulfilling. You have to have a
purpose in life, and for me it's being around people.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is at upscale restaurants, a sporting-goods store or
the local Wal-Mart, businesses want employees to be ``friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   At Luke's Running Store in Dallas' Oak Lawn neighborhood,
co-owner Sharon Lucas says she requires all her salespeople to
greet customers, not just the person standing closest to the door.
Usually, that is 39-year-old Brad Urschel, a self-described
``customer greeter,'' who has made welcoming customers his
specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Urschel was a college track star whose career was cut short
after an accident in which he was thrown from a car.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred Nov. 30, 1983. Urschel was 23 and had
graduated from Princeton University, where he earned a bachelor of
arts degree in neuropsychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were en route to a track meet,'' he says. ``The car got on
to the soft shoulder of the highway and flipped over one-and-a-half
times. I landed in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Urschel was in a coma for a month but fought his way back. He
still walks with a limp, but on most days, the father of two rides
his bicycle to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's being myself,'' Urschel says of his job. ``It's how I am.
I like to be friendly. I like to make a statement, in the way that
I dress, in my personality. It's an excitement for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas says, ``We value him so much because he is very friendly
and genuine. He's the kind of person you really like for people to
interface with when they come through your door.''
</P>
<P>
   Urschel, who has worked at Luke's for five years, says he tries
to determine what customers want so that he can direct them to the
person best qualified to help. He tries not to be intrusive or
overbearing.
</P>
<P>
   Although customer service has long been considered a benchmark
for successful businesses, not all establishments employ people for
the sole purpose of greeting customers. In area malls, for
instance, shoppers can walk in and out of many stores unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Bisio of Wal-Mart says, ``I think now the incarnation of store
greeters is really primarily for someone to send the message that
we're glad you're here and point you in the right direction when
you walk into a Wal-Mart.''
</P>
<P>
   That's 72-year-old Bill Webb's goal when he dons his blue vest
and stands at the entrance of the Wal-Mart in Arlington, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tickled to death,'' says Webb, a greeter for five years.
``I love people. I find conversation easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb says that his conversations with customers range from small
talk to directing them to items in the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 95 percent of my job,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   You might say that no one works a room quite like Sean Minto,
``all-around nice guy'' who is assistant general manager of
Angeluna, an upscale Fort Worth restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being on the door is important. I see people. I greet them and
make sure they are enjoying themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Minto's charm is his English accent. Part of it is his
quick wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch your step. I wouldn't want you to break your leg before
the show,'' he says, leading a dinner guest to a table.
</P>
<P>
   The show he's referring to is ``Chicago,'' scheduled to start in
an hour at Bass Performance Hall across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Minto doesn't miss a beat. He seats another couple and is back
at the front door before leading a group of diners to a window
seat. In the next moment, he's making small talk with Dr. Felipe
Garcia, seated with his date, Michelle Moquin, and his parents,
Felipe Sr. and Hortensia.
</P>
<P>
   Minto says that when he visits with patrons at their tables, he
does so ``without being too nosy or prying to much into people's
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   For Garcia, greeters represent a welcome change from the old
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when everything was quick and get out,'' he
says, snapping his fingers. ``The pendulum is swinging back now.''
</P>
<P>
   He likes Angeluna, where he says the customer is made to feel
special. And he is well aware that Minto knows him by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love people who know me, stroke me,'' Garcia says. ``That's
why I come back.''

obstetrics staff on the maternity wings at Arlington Memorial
Hospital, blame it on El Nino. Count back nine months, and Texans
were celebrating the first sustained cold snap after the
depressingly hot summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It's as good as any explanation, I guess, for this spate of
first-time parents, parents adding to already sizable broods, even
parents with grown-up offspring.
</P>
<P>
   All that enormous potential wrapped inside blue, pink and yellow
blankets. Little porous sponges of humanity, ready to soak up the
wonders that this world has to offer. And each one blessed with
families standing ready to make sure no harm comes to the newest
cherubs on God's earthly team.
</P>
<P>
   I confess that the sadness experienced by many Americans in the
past weeks after the deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and
his sister-in-law skipped our house. It was difficult to pay much
attention to eulogies for people I've never met and only read about
in glossy magazines when so many new arrivals had come into our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   One of my dearest friends and her husband gave birth to their
first child July 11. Forty-eight hours later, my husband became a
grandfather three times over within four minutes' time when his
stepdaughter and her husband gave birth to triplets.
</P>
<P>
   These things had a way of drawing one's focus to the here and
now and away from media trucks and naval search vessels
congregating along the Eastern seashore.
</P>
<P>
   Each one of these new Texans already has a leg up on the world _
a mommy and a daddy at home. Plenty of research exists to show that
married two-parent families provide the healthiest, safest
environments in which to raise children. Forty percent of America's
children _ 25 million kids under the age of 18, according to the
National Center for Fathering _ aren't as fortunate; their fathers
don't live in the same house. And the harsh consequences of broken
homes and single-parent families can be seen in the equally stark
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of a girl becoming a teen mother increases five
times if she is raised by an unmarried or divorced mother. The
chances of going to prison doubles for a boy growing up without a
father in the house.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that every single-parent family is doomed to
fail, or that dinner time with every two-parent family is like
watching reruns of ``Father Knows Best.'' But the odds are
definitely in the favor of those children being raised by Mom and
Dad under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   Which completely discounts the ridiculously unscientific and
politically biased report found in the June issue of American
Psychologist titled ``Deconstructing the Essential Father.'' Boston
Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby brought this piece to America's
attention earlier this week when he wrote about the article's
politically motivated attack on fatherhood and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond providing sperm and child support payments, fathers
apparently aren't essential, according to psychologists Louise
Silverstein and Carl Auerbach, who advocate for a broader welfare
system in this country. Dads don't contribute anything unique to a
child's development, and no empirical data exist to show that the
institution of marriage helps men be better people in general and
fathers in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to the researchers for the National Fatherhood
Initiative, the Fatherhood Project at the Families and Work
Institute, the American Coalition for Fathers and Children, and any
number of nonprofit groups specializing in the important role that
fathers play in their children's lives. Children without a father
in the same house show a dramatic increase in drug and alcohol
abuse, behavioral problems, poverty, suicide, dropping out of
school ...
</P>
<P>
   Geez, enough negatives. Let's look at what Catherine and Baylee,
Joshua and Zachary, Sawyer, Alexander and Brian have to look
forward to. Interaction between father and child promotes the
child's physical well-being, perceptual abilities and overall
competency. Grades improve when Dad is involved in school
activities. Dads who spend time alone with their children doing
routine child-care activities _ bathing, dressing, changing
diapers, singing them to sleep _ are helping to raise more
compassionate adults.
</P>
<P>
   Such tremendous potential wrapped inside blue, pink and yellow
blankets. Such giant head starts toward successful lives because
Mom AND Dad are standing by the crib.

WRONG WORD TO DESCRIBE TAX REDUCTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most annoying aspects of the ongoing debate over tax
cuts is the description of tax cuts as ``spending'' _ as if tax
relief were some sort of government giveaway program.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Ever since the possibility was raised that the
federal government might be racking up gigantic budget surpluses in
coming years, the politicians and the media have been babbling
about the best way to ``spend'' all the extra money.
</P>
<P>
   You know how it goes. The Democrats want to ``spend'' the budget
surplus on Social Security, Medicare, education, etc. The
Republicans want to ``spend'' the surplus on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The whole argument revolves around ``spending.''
</P>
<P>
   An article in Thursday's Wall Street Journal, for example,
referred to the possible use of the surplus ``to finance tax
cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   And the article quoted Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts: ``The
question is whether it should be spent on private goods or public
goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank, a Democrat who embodies the phrase ``tax-and-spend
liberal,'' would obviously prefer that the surplus be spent on
``public goods'' _ government programs, in other words _ rather
than on ``private goods,'' which is a synonym for ``tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   That politicians of either party want to spend the public's
money should not surprise us. But it is surprising, maybe even
shocking, that the word ``spend'' could come into play regarding
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Have we forgotten how the system works? Government collects
money from the citizenry for the purpose of providing certain
services that citizens can't provide, or don't wish to provide, for
themselves. This money belongs to the people, not to the
government; if more money is collected than the government needs to
deliver the designated services, then the money must be returned to
the people.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a subject for debate. It isn't some philosophical
concept that can be reasonably argued from various points of view.
It's a fact: If the federal government has a budget surplus, it
means that the government has collected too much money from the
taxpayers and therefore ``owes'' them a refund.
</P>
<P>
   The premise involved here is so fundamental that it's impossible
to comprehend how so many people could be so hopelessly ignorant of
how it works.
</P>
<P>
   So. We must conclude that ignorance has nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   We know that the president of the United States _ to name just
one offender _ has no qualms about misinforming, misstating,
misrepresenting or just plain lying through his teeth where matters
of public import are concerned. And we know that he is a highly
intelligent man who is a lifelong student of government as well as
the ins and outs of politics.
</P>
<P>
   It would only seem fair, then, to assume that Bill Clinton knows
perfectly well that cutting taxes is not spending but is in fact a
simple matter of returning the people's money to its rightful
owners. Clinton knows it, and so do all the other politicians and
pundits who are fostering the misconception that a tax cut is a
gift given by the government to the people.
</P>
<P>
   But the misconception seems to be taking hold. A Wall Street
Journal/NBC News poll suggests that most Americans don't want a tax
cut because they apparently buy into the Clintonian idea that
everyone would be better off if we let the politicians fritter away
all the extra money that we have forked over to the government.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Here's a suggestion. Let's make the tax cut voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   If there are all these high-minded _ naive? gullible? dumb? _
taxpayers who don't want their money back, they can notify the
Internal Revenue Service that they truly desire to continue paying
taxes at the current exorbitant rates and will not accept any
reduction in their tax bills. Clinton and the tax-and-spenders can
spend those folks' money till the cows home.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of us will be expecting Congress and the president
to reduce our tax bills in direct proportion to our share of the
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   We will accept cash or checks; no credit cards, please.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Two stately oaks on the front lawn grace the home
of Tracey and Carrie Jones, and the front door opens onto a long,
carpeted living room with a large fireplace at the far end. The
Joneses linger in their living room, pointing out the view from a
picture window, before showing a visitor two cramped bedrooms and a
kitchen too small for a breakfast table.
</P>
<P>
   The Joneses' single-story ranch house is definitely on the
modest side in Madeira, a prosperous Cincinnati suburb. They bought
it in 1995 for $132,000 _ the upper end of what they could afford.
Their family income of $49,700 puts them, statistically, in the
heart of the American middle class. But while Madeira would be an
ideal setting for a movie about a middle-class family, the Joneses
struggle to feel that they belong.
</P>
<P>
   The robust economy of the last three years has lifted their
family fortunes. Jones, 42, who designs machines that label plastic
containers, has watched his salary rise 9 percent since 1996, to
$43,500. Still, to make ends meet, he mows lawns in his off hours,
making an additional $1,700. And Mrs. Jones, 37 and raising two
children, provides a crucial extra by earning $4,500 as a part-time
bookkeeper for her dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when I feel comfortable about our lives,'' she
said, ``and there are times when I am with my friends _ most of
whom are not working because their husbands make more than enough
money _ and I wonder, `What are Tracey and I doing wrong?'''
</P>
<P>
   That a family taking in nearly $50,000 annually does not feel
securely in the middle class may be understandable in expensive
cities like New York or Los Angeles. But such sentiments are
evident in Cincinnati, too, where the cost of living is roughly
equal to the national average and the median family income mirrors
the nation's. Four middle-income families interviewed at length for
this article say they do not think of themselves as middle-income.
What looks good on paper does not, for them, translate into an easy
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people do not have any idea how the median family
lives,'' said Christopher Jencks, a sociologist at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. ``The biggest news is how
budget-constrained these people really are.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, middle-income families have been stuck in place for a
decade, their incomes even losing ground to inflation through part
of the 1990s, according to data from the Census Bureau. Only last
year did the middle-income family finally make significant
progress; the median income rose by more in 1998 than in any year
since 1986. Yet, in contrast to earlier generations, these families
don't see themselves as sharing in the national bounty. Instead,
they wonder why they have to struggle so hard just to pay the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the impression from television and the media that our
prosperity is huge, but that is not the middle-class experience,''
said Marc Miringoff, a Fordham University expert on social
indicators and co-author of a new book, ``The Social Health of the
Nation'' (Oxford University Press). ``These families have had to
work hard for their modest gains.''
</P>
<P>
   The median family income is somewhere between $46,500 and
$50,000 a year, according to estimates by Census Bureau officials
and private economists. (The Census Bureau will publish the exact
1998 figure next month and the 1999 median in September of next
year.) That means that half the nation's 71 million families earn
more and can afford more than Tracey and Carrie Jones, and half
earn less and live in greater hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, middle-income families in America have acquired more
possessions than their parents and grandparents had. But the
middle-class comforts of an earlier day were accessible to families
with just one earner; today, middle-income families find that they
must combine at least two incomes, and often three, in pursuit of a
life style that seems always out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   And they work harder each year to earn that income. A married
couple with one or two children, for example, worked an average of
3,860 hours _ more than two full-time jobs _ in 1997, up from 3,236
hours in 1979, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data by
the Economic Policy Institute. Only 28 percent of the nation's
middle-income families scrape by with just one earner, the Census
Bureau says, and that is usually because there is only one parent.
</P>
<P>
   What worked for the last generation no longer works for this
one. But ask the Cincinnati couples, who range in age from 25 to
65, to compare their lives with those of their parents, and they
say that the exercise would not be relevant. Jones' father, for
example, made lots of money in a machinery sales business he
started at age 55, after struggling most of his adult life as a
machinery salesman for others. ``I won't accelerate as fast as he
finally did,'' Jones said, ``but I'll get there in time.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s and early 1990s, when middle-income
breadwinners were losing jobs right and left and incomes were
stagnating, public opinion polls suggested that for the first time
in generations, American families believed that their children
would not do as well economically as their parents had. For now,
that doubt has faded. While their lives are a constant, precarious
struggle, with periodic setbacks, the four families here say they
are making progress nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a different time,'' said Frank Levy, a labor
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``We do
measure progress against our parents, but not that `I will be
better off at age 30 or 40.' It is, `Am I going to end up being
better off?'''
</P>
<P>
   There are guideposts in this ill-defined journey, the most
important being home ownership. All four families own modest homes
that were bought for less than $140,000, the average price here.
Three are on their second or third homes, having traded up each
time. All the houses are air-conditioned, with showcase living
rooms, and all are comfortably furnished, however small and
cluttered the bedrooms and bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple car ownership is another common characteristic, though
most of the vehicles were bought secondhand and some now have more
than 100,000 miles on them. The families also have small stock
portfolios, which have risen in value as the market has climbed,
but in their eyes, the holdings are too small to spur spending.
They view them instead as savings for retirement or a rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They all struggle to keep their spending in line with their
earnings, showing an aversion to debt that government statisticians
say is characteristic of the middle class. In sharp contrast,
lower-income families spend far beyond their incomes, according to
the consumer expenditure surveys of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Not that families in the middle are averse to spending: The four
in Cincinnati are steady shoppers, acquiring, among other things,
big double-door refrigerators, radiant-heat stoves, expensive
stereo equipment, cherry dining room sets, big-screen TVs, boxes of
toys, computers and elaborate outdoor grills. One home even has an
in-ground backyard swimming pool with a diving board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think middle-income people have acquired a lot in this
recovery,'' said Douglas Haskell, associate director of the Center
for Economic Education at the University of Cincinnati. ``But that
only seems to accelerate their desire for more.''
</P>
<P>
   THE STARTERS: Paying the Price for Home Improvement &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely owners of the backyard pool are Sean Brandyberry,
25, a data manager, and his wife, Tulena, 24. As evangelical
Christians, hoping to spend at least some of their time in
missionary work, the couple shun material trappings. For them, a
rising income is the road to financial independence, not to a home
with a backyard pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is how a lot of people define their lives, by how much
they have,'' Brandyberry said. ``I am not saying we are above that
thinking. We clearly aren't. But we try not to let it be a
conscious force driving our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The pool came with the 30-year-old, two-story, four-bedroom home
in Springfield Township that they acquired last year for $65,000 in
an estate sale. The pool was filled with weeds and dirt, the house
rundown. ``I thought I would fix it up and sell it at a profit,''
Brandyberry said. But with two infants, and three more children
planned, his wife wanted bigger quarters than the two-family duplex
in which they had lived the previous 18 months, occupying one
apartment and renting out the other. So they moved into the new
house themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, this past June, the Brandyberrys became a
middle-income family, when Brandyberry asked for a raise and got a
big one _ to $34,600 from $29,200. He works for Kendle
International Inc., a rapidly growing company based in Cincinnati
that specializes in auditing doctors who test new drugs for
pharmaceutical companies. His college degree was in religion; he
even spent his junior year analyzing the Bible at Hebrew University
in Jerusalem. But he had done well in math and science, and, having
married before graduation, he tapped those skills to make a living,
joining Kendle in late 1996 as a data processor.
</P>
<P>
   While Brandyberry's salary alone is well below the median family
income, he and his wife have kept their duplex and rent the
apartments, adding $2,400 to their net income. Mrs. Brandyberry,
trained in accounting, gets the family the rest of the way, earning
$12,000 by auditing Kendle expense accounts at home.
</P>
<P>
   Their total income, then, is $49,000. Their mortgage debt is
$131,000, at 7 percent, and they owe $3,000 on a school loan.
``What we have in income is what God intended us to have,''
Brandyberry said, ``and we have a responsibility to be good
stewards of what he has given us.''
</P>
<P>
   That means saving. But for all of their effort to do so, much of
the young couple's cash reserve has gone into fixing up the house
with touches like a new sliding glass door from the kitchen to the
backyard and, most expensive of all, a new pump and other equipment
for the pool.
</P>
<P>
   In his day, Brandyberry's father had a similar fast start after
college, joining the booming retail industry and working for more
than 20 years as an assistant store manager for J.C. Penney, only
to be laid off three years ago. He is working again as a retail
store executive, but without regaining his old status or income.
</P>
<P>
   Could that happen to the son? Brandyberry sees growth and
promise in the pharmaceutical industry, and he tells that to his
father, who replies that he had the same confidence in retailing
when he was young. ``That is why I want to be financially
independent,'' the son said.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, however, the Brandyberrys are stuck on the spending
treadmill. Their only car is a 1992 Honda Civic that Brandyberry
drives to work; it has 125,000 miles on it. They plan to buy a used
minivan for Mrs. Brandyberry _ yet another expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we need something bigger for the two kids,''
Brandyberry said. ``I guess need is a strong word. We would like a
minivan as the second car.''
</P>
<P>
   THE STRUGGLERS: Wishes Deferred And Plans Unmet
</P>
<P>
   When the Fraziers _ Carl, 65, and his wife, Geraldine, 54 _
imagine the good life, they think of the vacation they take almost
every year in a $400-a-week condo in Fort Myers, Fla. ``The sand is
so white,'' Frazier said. ``You are sitting on the porch, looking
out over the bay. All you have to do is change your bathing suit
once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fraziers have a slightly greater annual income than the
typical family _ more than $50,000 a year _ yet in their own
perception, life has been hard. They are the only couple of the
four still living in their original home _ a single-story,
three-bedroom brick house in the northwestern part of Cincinnati.
They bought it for $19,500 in 1971, the year they married. The long
stay was not Frazier's intention.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``My original plan was to use this house as a stepping stone,''
he said. ``I was a real estate broker then, and I got this house on
a repossession. Segregation, as far as home-buying was concerned,
was winding down, and there were good houses available. I was going
to upgrade my neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights movement, however, diverted him. Frazier worked
at General Electric's big jet aircraft engine plant in Cincinnati.
After service in the Navy, he went to night school for four years,
earning a degree as a specialist in electrical power. And GE picked
him as the first black to work in technical publications, writing
manuals and other material about the engines.
</P>
<P>
   But some of his new office colleagues resisted his presence,
Frazier said, refusing for a while to break him in on the job.
Dealing with that absorbed his energy and blunted his progress.
Racial tension at a public school affected one of the four children
in the Frazier household, eating up their attention and energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was spreading myself too thin,'' Frazier said. ``I lost my
focus on my plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fraziers today contribute roughly equal amounts to the
family's income. Mrs. Frazier, a secretary at the University of
Cincinnati, brings home $28,500 a year in a job that also offers
group health insurance. Frazier found himself forced into
retirement in 1995 as GE downsized. His Social Security and company
pension total $12,000 a year, and he works a few hours a day at a
YMCA for $11,000 more. And Mrs. Frazier signed on for night work
with H &AMP; R Block during tax season, earning $800, so their income
this year will be just over $52,000.
</P>
<P>
   But there are debts _ and desires. Years ago, the Fraziers got
in over their heads in credit card spending, and when Frazier
retired they still owed more than $6,000. His severance package and
a $35,000 home equity loan, at 7 percent, got their finances in
order and allowed the purchase of a minivan and central
air-conditioning, along with a dining room table, a living room
sofa and stereo equipment (bought at a garage sale).
</P>
<P>
   Frazier has discovered the interest-free 90-day payment plan and
has used it for several recent purchases, including a dining room
sideboard and an elaborate outdoor grill. But there are more needs,
including a car for Mrs. Frazier to drive to work and various home
repairs that Frazier is resisting. Having avoided new credit card
debt, except for a small balance from this year's vacation, he
wants to wait until the home equity loan is paid off, at $700 a
month for three more years.
</P>
<P>
   That is hard on Mrs. Frazier. ``I want my house set, so that
when I come to it I have it the way I want it,'' she said. ``But if
we make a wrong move, the pressure we had from the bills will come
back, and that is painful.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BUILDERS: Dogged Saving And Some Luxuries
</P>
<P>
   Government jobs lift tens of thousands of families into the
middle class, offering them a security that the Fraziers do not
feel. Gian Nguyen, 51, a Vietnamese immigrant, has taken this
route, partly in response to his early hardships in this country. A
Navy lieutenant in South Vietnam who had studied there to teach
high school math and science, he found himself in America in the
late 1970s working as a minimum-wage laborer.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Nguyen's $44,500 salary as an engineer for Cincinnati's
Metropolitan Sewer District doesn't quite bring the family to the
national median. But his wife, Kim, 41, also from Vietnam, opened a
nail salon two years ago that has finally turned a profit, netting
$4,000 so far this year. The shop's success is so important to them
that Nguyen has obtained a license in nail care, so that he can
help out in his off hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever she has three or four customers, she calls me, and I
run right over,'' said Nguyen, who gets home from his city job by 3
p.m. The salon's specialty is false nails, a booming business these
days, but there are so many competing salons that Mrs. Nguyen has
dropped her price for a set to $25, from $30.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, who earned an engineering degree from Wright State
University in Dayton in the mid-1980s, is bent on building up the
family fortunes. Consumer spending does not have as much appeal for
the Nguyens as it does for many native-born Americans, he and his
wife say, although their son and daughter, both born in the United
States, are moving in that direction. How much does the family
save? ``He makes $2,000 and we save $1,800,'' Mrs. Nguyen said. He
corrected her. ``It's $1,200,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nguyen explained how they manage: ``We don't go out to eat.
We don't travel. We buy clothes on sale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This dress I'm wearing,'' she said (it is a long black cotton
garment with a white flower design), ``cost $10.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nguyens, who married in 1981, are on their third house, a
single-story, three-bedroom brick home in Norwood bought in 1995
for $113,000. Their $25,000 mortgage is paid off, Nguyen said. He
and his wife have no credit cards. Their 16-year-old daughter,
Alice, making $100 a week at a summer job, turns over $70 to her
mother to save. Their stock holdings, which they value at roughly
$100,000, are regarded as a retirement nest egg.
</P>
<P>
   The Nguyens have embraced the ways of middle-income American
families. They receive a visitor in a thickly carpeted, comfortably
furnished living room. Their kitchen has all the modern appliances,
including a refrigerator with water and ice spigots on the door.
Three cars are parked outside. The master bedroom features a
four-poster bed and flowered sheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want a bigger house,'' Nguyen said, ``but we would
like a newer house.''
</P>
<P>
   THE STRIVERS: Goals That Remain Just Out of Sight
</P>
<P>
   Living among neighbors who have more possessions than they do,
Tracey and Carrie Jones wonder if they will ever close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   After years of procrastination, as Jones puts it, he received a
two-year degree in mechanical engineering technology in 1993, so
that he could compete more effectively against unemployed engineers
seeking machinery design work. He had been laid off himself in the
early 1990's and worked as a temporary employee for up to $19 an
hour before landing his current job at Superior Machine Systems in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Jones dropped out of college, where she had studied
nursing partly to please her father, a doctor. Only later, while
working for a savings and loan association and then Fifth Third
Bank, did she realize that accounting was her true calling.
</P>
<P>
   She went to a part-time work schedule after her second child was
born in 1994, working enough hours to provide benefits for the
family until her husband landed at Superior Machine Systems. The
rising cost of child care persuaded her to switch to the
bookkeeping job for her dentist on a more flexible schedule, though
at less than half the pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was making $11,000 at the bank and paying the woman who
cared for my children $4,500, and I did not feel that was worth it,
being away from my kids,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are sacrifices. The Joneses have just taken on a
$10,000 home equity loan to buy a used car. And there are stressful
moments with acquaintances who are in better financial shape. Mrs.
Jones remembered driving with a friend who was talking about
remodeling and enlarging her kitchen. ``And I thought to myself:
`Isn't it big enough? It's plenty big now,''' she recalled. ``She
asked me a couple of months ago when were we going to upgrade our
kitchen, and I said my kitchen was big enough.''

   The New York Times News Service plans the following articles
from the Style section for use Sunday, Aug. 1, and thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   NY-PERELMAN (New York) _ The scorekeepers of the world might
credit Ronald Owen Perelman with having it all. A net worth of $4.2
billion, by Forbes's last count. Palatial residences in Manhattan,
East Hampton and Palm Beach wallpapered with modern art. A jet, a
yacht, all the toys. And now, Ellen Barkin _ the sultry 45-year-old
actress who is expected to become his fourth wife. But for these
riches, the very private Perelman, 56, has paid an expensively
public price. Many of his business and personal affairs have ended
in courtroom dramas over the years. By Rick Marin.
</P>
<P>
   RICKY`S-DRUGSTORE (New York) _ Ricky's drugstore might not
attract lunch-hour shoppers rushing out for staples or the Upper
East Siders who browse at pharmacies like Zitomer and Boyd's. But
it has become a crossroads for New York's funky, flamboyant masses:
makeup artists, actors, club kids and drag queens. By Nancy Hass.

</P>
<P>
   FAD-DIETS (Undated) _ Over the last two decades, I have tried
every diet from Cambridge to Scarsdale and every weight-loss
gimmick from inflatable leg massagers to acupuncture needles in my
ears (which were supposed to enhance serotonin and suppress my
appetite). My motivation was both personal (I am a former chemistry
nerd who truly loves nutrition) and professional (for years, I was
a beauty and health editor at a women's magazine, where it was my
duty to experience the latest and greatest). By Martha McCully.
</P>
<P>
   THEME-PARTYNIGHTS (New York) _ As if New York's bars and clubs
didn't have enough singles rubbing elbows and noses, some of them
are taking mating-mixology to the next level: mixer bashes
disguised as theme nights. Downtown weekly events like ``Punk Rock
Karaoke,'' held at Arlene's Grocery, and the Hula Hoop competition
at the Tortilla Flats restaurant, have a decidedly kitschy edge. By
Julia Chaplin.
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-LOEB (New York) _ At Damian Loeb's spare TriBeCa studio
on a recent Saturday night, Loeb, a painter, was putting some final
strokes on a work for an upcoming show in London. His best friend,
Richard Hall, the electronic music star known as Moby, zoned out
before a large-screen television hooked up to a spy camera,
allowing him to watch people walking by on the street, a form of
entertainment that Loeb prefers to real television. When they get
together, the two friends refer to themselves as a sort of ``Beavis
and Butt-head'' of the downtown art scene. By Anthony Lappe. Photo.

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Sumac (pronounced SOO-mack or
SHOO-mack, whichever you prefer) is a native shrub throughout most
of the United States, thriving on roadsides, in abandoned fields
and in undisturbed, sunny and well-drained places. It has shiny
green leaves in pairs along the stem, like locust trees, and in
late summer the most common varieties bear fat spikes of small,
clustered red berries. By Cass Peterson.

<HEADLINE>
SUMACS, FOR BURSTS OF SCARLET AND LEMONADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 1)  
 (bl)  
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I bought the country acreage I now call home, the road
frontage to the west of the house was edged by a couple of wild
cherry trees draped with poison ivy, a random specimen or two of
multiflora rose, a few elderberry bushes and a thicket of sumac.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors counseled me to clear it out, a formidable chore
that would have required the chain saw, heavy shears and hours of
toil that I preferred to spend on other tasks that also needed
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen years later, the fencerow _ the growth is called a
fencerow even though there is no fence there and never was _ has
finally made it to the top of the end-of-season chore list. Given a
reasonable period of time this year between the falling of the
leaves and the falling of the snow, I will hack my way through the
multiflora roses and elderberries, and gingerly remove the poison
ivy vines.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of waiting is that I now know enough to leave the
wild cherry trees alone (their fruit lures birds away from my
blueberries), and to do nothing more to the sumac thicket than cut
the wild brambles that threaten to obscure my view of it. What a
mistake it would have been to clear out that sumac.
</P>
<P>
   Sumac (pronounced SOO-mack or SHOO-mack, whichever you prefer)
is a native shrub throughout most of the United States, thriving on
roadsides, in abandoned fields and in undisturbed, sunny and
well-drained places. It has shiny green leaves in pairs along the
stem, like locust trees, and in late summer the most common
varieties bear fat spikes of small, clustered red berries.
</P>
<P>
   Even urban dwellers who never get close enough to examine the
leaves or berries have undoubtedly seen sumac. It's one of the
first deciduous shrubs to turn color in autumn, and its flaming
scarlet foliage is hard to miss even when you're speeding by at 60
miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle is even better at the speed of a stroll, because
the autumn shrubs are often adorned with birds _ tanagers,
flickers, cedar waxwings and others _ clinging to the woody stems
while they gorge themselves on sumac berries.
</P>
<P>
   You can use the berries yourself to make sumac lemonade, a
passable substitute for pink lemonade. To do that, gather the fully
colored berries in late summer or fall, rub them gently to crush
them, and soak them for 15 minutes or so in cold water. Strain the
pink juice through cheesecloth and sweeten it to taste.
</P>
<P>
   For two bad reasons and one good one, sumac isn't often planted
as an ornamental. Among the bad reasons is the erroneous notion
that it's poisonous. Sumacs belong to the cashew family,
Anacardiaceae, and to the genus Rhus, which also used to be the
taxonomical home of poison ivy (formerly R. radicans) and poison
sumac (formerly R. vernix).
</P>
<P>
   Taxonomists have since moved both of the itchy sisters to the
genus Toxicodendron, but the unfortunate association of ``poison''
with ``sumac'' lives on. Poison sumac foliage superficially
resembles that of the innocent sumacs, but it grows in swampy, wet
areas instead of dry spots and has grayish-white berries instead of
red ones.
</P>
<P>
   A second bad reason for not planting sumac is its nativeness.
Gardeners tend to weed out what grows naturally, not plant it. This
is good reasoning when applied to dandelions and chickweed; when
applied to herbaceous and woody perennials, it eliminates fine
plants like native day lilies and asters, wild yarrow and
goldenrod, serviceberry and sumac.
</P>
<P>
   An arguably good reason for not planting sumac is lack of space.
Depending on variety, native sumacs grow from 15 to 25 feet tall,
but they look best if allowed to sucker freely and form dense
thickets. Even as a specimen plant, though, a single sumac is still
worth growing.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known native sumac is staghorn sumac (R. typhina). Many
gardeners suppose the common name comes from the forked branches,
which do indeed _ especially when they are bare of foliage in the
winter _ look like a fine rack of antlers. But the name really
refers to the fact that staghorn sumac has twigs and leaflets
covered with fine, downy hairs, like the velvet that covers a
deer's antlers in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as common in the East is smooth sumac, which has the same
forked branches but lacks the velvety hairs of staghorn sumac.
Smooth sumac also tends to be lower-growing than the staghorn
variety. Both staghorn and smooth sumac are available in forms
called Lacianata, with finely cut leaves that add to their
ornamental value.
</P>
<P>
   There are other species of sumac suitable for the garden,
including fragrant sumac (R. aromatica) and Chinese sumac (R.
chinensis).
</P>
<P>
   Fragrant sumac is smaller than staghorn or smooth sumac, growing
to a maximum height and spread of about six feet. Its yellow
flowers are showier in the spring than those of the native species,
but you'll get the spring show at the sacrifice of the autumn show.
Its fall foliage is not as flashy as the native species'.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese sumac produces cream-colored flowers in summer, and
grows to around 25 feet. It's a nice ornamental, but its orange
berries don't make very good pink lemonade and don't seem as
attractive to birds.
</P>
<P>
   Since I'll be closing down part of their smorgasbord by
eliminating the rose hips, the elderberries and the poison ivy
berries, I really feel I owe the birds their fencerow sumac.
</P>
<P>
   A wide variety of sumacs is available from Forest Farm, 990
Tetherow Road, Williams, Ore. 97544; (541) 846-7269; catalog $4.

EVEN HISTORY OF KOSOVO IS A MATTER OF DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ERIC ALTERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a more perfect world, the warring sides in ethnic disputes
over territory and equitable treatment might lay down their arms
and submit themselves to a panel of historical experts who would
study the record and determine which side's claims had greater
merit. There would be a ruling, and each side would retire its
unjustifiable demands in the face of superior historical
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Were such a world ever to come into being, books about such
contemporary historical disputes as the fate of Kosovo would be
fought over with an even greater degree of ferocity than they are
today. Even now, challenging a historical claim considered by many
to be a matter of life and death is not work for the faint of
heart. As Ernest Renan, a French historian and essayist, said a
century ago, ``Getting history wrong is an essential part of being
a nation.'' Just consider how the Serbian leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, exploited the history of a battle that occurred more
than 600 years ago to legitimize nationalist claims to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Separating documentable truths from widely shared myths is no
easy task. Kosovo's historical tableau has been carved upon at
various moments by Romans, Byzantines, Bulgarians, Vlachs, Germans,
Hungarians, Turks, Gypsies, Jews and Circassians, as well as Serbs
and Albanians. Roman Catholicism, Orthodox Islam and Judaism have
all played an influential role in determining the life of the area,
to say nothing of Communism, Fascism and nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars from various disciplines have tried to unravel the
Balkans' tangled past. One writer recently counted 160 books
dealing with the region published in only the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Verdery, a professor of anthropology at the University
of Michigan, for instance, just published a study on the way ``dead
bodies on the move'' _ her expression for repeated reburials of
ancestors and historical heroes _ have helped shape traditionally
religious societies emerging from Communism. The book, ``The
Political Lives of Dead Bodies: Reburial and Post-Socialist
Change'' (Columbia University Press, 1999), explores the
post-mortem travels of Prince Lazare of Serbia, whose traveling
bones have done so much to roil the Serbian population 600 years
after his death and inspire the patriotic fervor that helped set
off the war in Kosovo. (American Navy and Army welders recently
repaired a statue of Lazare that had been lassoed and pulled to the
ground by several hundred Albanians.)
</P>
<P>
   Taking another tack, Maria Tedorov's ``Imagining the Balkans''
(Oxford University Press, 1997) points to a history of Western
distortion in the portrayal of Balkan societies not unlike that
pursued by Edward Said in his landmark study of the representation
of the East, ``Orientalism.'' Ms. Tedorov calls into question
whether outsiders can ever understand the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Wars have a way of calling attention to scholarly specialties
that tend to get unnoticed otherwise, offering a historian 15
minutes of fame _ or at least a 15-second sound bite on television.
Given the continued fighting in the region, it is perhaps
unavoidable that reactions to this history are colored by the
politics of the day. It is a place where history bleeds into the
present. President Clinton was said to be heavily influenced by
Robert D. Kaplan's ``Balkan Ghosts'' (Random House, 1994), which
implied that no solution was possible in an area so fraught with
``ancient hatreds.'' People close to the president said reluctance
to get involved in the Balkans in the early 1990s was at least
partially attributable to the book's influence on the president's
understanding of the region's history.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   When the action switched to Kosovo, the United States adopted a
much more assertive policy in the area. In this case, two of the
books that have come to dominate the debate among scholars and
policymakers take direct aim at the ``ancient-hatreds'' school of
history.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda Vickers' ``Between Serb and Albanian: A History of
Kosovo'' (Columbia University Press, 1998) focuses primarily on the
20th-century history of the province. Ms. Vickers argues that the
conflict began in earnest when the Yugoslavian regime incorporated
the Kosovar Albanians, and then instituted periods of repression
and intolerance that destroyed the uneasy balance between the two
ethnic populations there.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Noel Malcolm's book, ``Kosovo: A Short History'' (New
York University Press, 1998), demonstrates that the area now called
Kosovo enjoyed a long period of peaceful coexistence and sometimes
even cooperation between the Serb and Albanian populations of the
area. Like Ms. Vickers, he blames the recent troubles virtually
exclusively on the ambitions of late 20th-century Serb nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   What has made Malcolm's work particularly controversial is the
manner in which he puts a torch to virtually every sacred myth the
Serbs hold dear, along with a few of the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm, who taught at Cambridge University for seven years, has
taken aim at many of the accepted conventions of Serbian history.
Like other historians before him, he disputes the Serbs' sacred
founding myth, that the courageous though unsuccessful resistance
of the Serbs to the Ottoman Turks in Kosovo in 1389 ended the
Serbian empire. He says it began to fall apart three decades
earlier. And he takes issue with another myth: that when the
Austrian Army penetrated Kosovo in 1689 and forced the Ottoman
Turks out of the region, the Serbian Orthodox patriarch, Arsenije
Crnojevic, inspired the local Serbs to join the Austrians against
the Turks; that on New Year's Day, 1690, the Austrians were
defeated in battle by the Turks, and that Crnojevic then led a
retreat from Kosovo, allowing the Muslim Albanians to settle the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm insists that Austrians were met not by Crnojevic, but by
the Albanian Catholic archbishop, Pjeter Bogdani. Moreover, he
says, the patriarch led no ``Great Migration'' of Serbs out of
Kosovo but simply cut and ran.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Judah, writing in The New York Review of Books, likened
Malcolm's task to ``someone claiming that the Mayflower sailed from
America to Britain or that Ellis Island had little to do with
immigration to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm has also questioned some of Kosovo's more recent
history. He argues that the portrayal of Yugoslavians' resistance
to the Nazis has been exaggerated and deployed as pro-Serb
propaganda. He says, for example, that only four German divisions,
not hundreds, were kept in Yugoslavia during the occupation. Nor
did Tito manage to tie up Hitler's forces, as the Serbs claim.
Malcolm writes that ``Tito's `liberation' of areas of remote
countryside'' did not ``affect the German war effort in any vital
way: the Germans and Italians continued to control the large towns,
the major roads and railways, and the mines.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have taken issue with Malcolm for his attachment to
old-fashioned forms of historical narrative. Karen Barkey, a
sociologist at Columbia at work on a study of the Balkans, finds
Malcolm's version simplistic. To believe that there can be ``one
single correct history,'' Ms. Barkey says, ``misses the way in
which facts are created and how people make their own history by
shaping their own myths.''
</P>
<P>
   Those with a particular sensitivity to Serb concerns, however,
have accused Malcolm's history of being tainted by ideology. Alexa
Djilas, a Montenegran Serbian writer who recently returned to
Belgrade from the United States, complained in Foreign Affairs
magazine: ``It is tempting to dismiss Malcolm as a popularizer or
charlatan. His account is marred by his sympathies for the
Albanians and his illusions about the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   There is more at stake than scholarly reputations. Letters to
the editor of Serbian publications during the war frequently
invoked 1389 as its justification. And even American senators and
congressmen have mentioned the gilded version of Yugoslav
resistance to the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nations do not easily give up their myths to
historians. As the historian Eric Hobsbawm once observed:
``Unfortunately, the one thing historical experience has taught
historians is that nobody ever seems to learn from it. Still we
must go on trying.''

BOCHCO TO THE RESCUE: WHAT IT TAKES TO GET BLACKS ON NETWORK TV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ When I first heard about a new black drama
supervised by superproducer Steven Bochco, my heart raced just
imagining that a series with more than two tokens-of-color would
have a fighting chance. Bochco, he of ``Hill Street Blues,'' of
``L.A. Law,'' of ``NYPD Blue,'' is a god in an industry that
worships ratings, money, power and the perception of talent.
</P>
<P>
   What Bochco says goes. And for at least 13 episodes.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who has even a passing interest in television and its
players realizes this pitiful fact: It takes a white producer to
make a black-oriented television drama.
</P>
<P>
   Paris Barclay, the respected, black writer/producer of ``NYPD
Blue,'' is a co-creator with Bochco of the new ``City of Angels.''
But even he is quick to acknowledge that the series wouldn't be on
a network's midseason schedule if the Tommy Hilfiger of network TV
hadn't used his name to sell the thing.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bochco's hour-long series, focusing on an underfunded,
understaffed, underappreciated hospital that employs mostly black
and Hispanic doctors and serves a minority-majority neighborhood,
is set for production _ and ready for its racial litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   In a town where blacks and Hispanics have been devalued and
essentially ignored _ not just this season, but ALWAYS _ the mere
``announcement'' from the Bochco camp made people wonder about the
show's Madison Avenue clout, worry about its casting, and place it
neatly in the ``promising'' and ``long-awaited'' categories.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder CBS is pumped at the prospect of getting this series
on air in January or shortly thereafter. ``City of Angels,'' which
has signed Blair Underwood, Michael Warren and Vivica A. Fox
(getting A-list black talent isn't hard when everyone's available),
already carries name recognition without the press seeing a second
of production tape.
</P>
<P>
   Call me picky, pessimistic, or a chronically displeased race
zealot. But it's unsettling to see the industry and the press jump
aboard this project sight unseen _ especially as we've seen other
dramas featuring largely black and Hispanic casts, such as Thomas
Carter's family tale ``Under One Roof,'' Damon Wayans' ``413 Hope
Street,'' and Kevin Arkadie's ``New York Undercover,'' die quick or
mysterious deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the urgency involves our present atmosphere of minority
exclusion. In this climate, any series with a predominantly black
or Hispanic cast will be singled out, particularly within the drama
genre.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with black writers, producers and stars over the
past three weeks have made it obvious to me that we are stepping
over the real issues, which go much deeper than mere on-camera
representation.
</P>
<P>
   This is a town where power rules. And what ``City of Angels''
represents is the lack of power for people of color. One actor told
me he felt an odd mixture of hope, thanks, anger and envy when
learning of the Bochco project. Though he thought it was a step in
the right direction, he also felt a twinge of disappointment over
the Bochco image as All-Mighty Savior.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, it was disheartening to see the
overwhelming number of black-cast shows being fronted by white
producers, who mounted the interview stages like parents toting
their young. As black writers rose to supervising producers and
then to executive producers with the power to create and run their
own projects, the image shifted, at least within the comedy genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``City of Angels'' would have to be a complete failure to keep
Barclay from getting a toehold within this power structure. Maybe
he can return to do more shows, hiring other people of color who
could then rise through the ranks as he did. The cycle would
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Or else the current one will stay in place. One of the greatest
failings of this town is its segregation, physical and mental and
emotional. As Barclay says, ``People are afraid. They're afraid of
what they don't know and, if you don't know a lot of different
people, you're not going to write them, you're not going to invite
them to be in the room with you to create shows, and the shows
aren't going to get on the air, because they're not going to be the
things that the networks have to choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   This becomes even more clear when you consider producers like
Kevin Williamson. He has turned his life experience into two
series, ``Dawson's Creek'' and the new ``Wasteland,'' an ABC show
about singles navigating New York City life.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson was criticized for the absence of black and brown
faces in ``Wasteland,'' with people noting that you couldn't go to
New York without seeing a melting pot.
</P>
<P>
   I disagree. Williamson's reality is a world without people of
color, and he's simply showing that world.
</P>
<P>
   It's neither right nor wrong. It's just unfortunate in a medium
where there are simply too many Williamsons and too few Barclays
with the power to put their lives onscreen.

 FDA SAYS IT WILL CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL INTERNET DRUG SALES
 (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal Food and Drug Administration told
Congress Friday it plans to crack down on Internet sites that sell
prescription drugs illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients who buy prescription drugs from an illegitimate site
are at risk of suffering life-threatening adverse events,'' said
Janet Woodcock, FDA's director of drug planning and research. She
said the agency intends to ``significantly expand its enforcement
activities'' for online sales.
</P>
<P>
   Woodcock announced the FDA's plans at a House Commerce
Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight hearing on Internet
prescription drug sales. The FDA has authority to bring action
against anyone who sells prescription drugs without a valid
prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the panel, said there are
about 400 Internet retailers that may be illegally selling
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these sites today allow consumers to order
prescription medication, even without ever seeing a doctor
face-to-face and sometimes even without a valid prescription,''
Upton said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers expressed alarm that the Food and Drug
Administration is only now announcing a crack down on such Internet
drug sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., said there were only about 26
suspicious Internet drug sites when committee staffers began
looking into the issue in January but that the number keeps growing
by dozens each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the cop on the beat?'' he asked. ``Next month there
will be 500 sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodcock said there are a ``large number of cases'' under
investigation. She also said the FDA will double the number of
Internet drug investigators from 10 to 20.
</P>
<P>
   She admitted that the FDA is struggling to keep up with the
proliferation of Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unique qualities of the Internet, including its broad
reach and ability for anonymity, pose new challenges for
enforcement of existing laws,'' Woodcock said. ``FDA is grappling
with the challenges posed by online drug sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the illegal sites are shut down, Woodcock said consumers
can protect themselves by staying away from Internet drug sites
altogether or asking their physicians for the name of a reputable
site.
</P>
<P>
   It is illegal for people to order medicine from the Internet
without a valid prescription, she said.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain a prescription drug legally, Woodcock said, a person
must visit a doctor or other licensed health care practitioner who
will then write a prescription if it's medically necessary. A
patient must take that prescription, or have a doctor phone it in,
to a state-licensed pharmacy to have it filled. The pharmacy then
calls the doctor to ensure the prescription is valid.
</P>
<P>
   There are also legitimate Internet web sites such as
drugstore.com or PlanetRx.com in which a physician can call or fax
a prescription to that Internet site. Drugstore.com and PlantRx.com
are licensed to sell drugs in each state.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Kansas recently sued six Internet drug operators
for selling drugs without a state license. The cases are still
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Stovall, Kansas's attorney general, said the most
difficult thing for her investigators was tracking down who was
actually behind the Internet site, which usually do not contain a
valid company name or address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had to sort through multiple shell corporations,
addresses that turned out to be mail drops, overlapping addresses
shared by different entities and similar evasive tactics,'' Stovall
said.
</P>
<P>
   To stem the flow of illegal Internet drugs, Stovall said the
states and the federal government would have to sharply increase
the number of investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Upton said he would like to see increased cooperation between
state and federal authorities in order to limit the growth of
Internet drug sites, but other lawmakers were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not convinced that either the states or the federal
government is even close to having a handle on this,'' said Rep.
Ron Klink, D-Pa.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While the entrance to the average Duane Reade has a
Pepsi display and a bin of Tylenol gel caps, the Ricky's drugstore
on Broadway in Greenwich Village has a showcase of studded collars
and cuffs labeled ``Ricky's Fantasy Cabinet'' and a wall of more
than 125 multicolor synthetic wigs, including a kelly green pageboy
and a white Marie Antoinette do.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there is the usual complement of toothpaste and shampoo,
but instead of Prell, Head &AMP; Shoulders and Aqua-Fresh, the brands
are obscure products in exotic packages. Along one wall are more
than 100 styles of false eyelashes, and down a nearby aisle in the
corner, under a disco ball, is a section devoted to erotic
novelties and cheesy lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably not a place that your grandmother would feel
comfortable,'' said Ricky Kenig, who with his family owns the
store, the flagship of a five-drugstore chain. ``Though we would
try hard to make her feel at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky's might not attract lunch-hour shoppers rushing out for
staples or the Upper East Siders who browse at pharmacies like
Zitomer and Boyd's. But it has become a crossroads for New York's
funky, flamboyant masses: makeup artists, actors, club kids and
drag queens.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky's stores, strategically situated in Manhattan's more hip
and touristy neighborhoods (Soho, the Village, midtown), are as
different from Rite Aid as the Strand is from Barnes &AMP; Noble. With
neon and custom-graffitied signs pointing the way to the hair
brushes, rap and R &AMP; B ballads booming in the background and
merchandise that glitters, Ricky's stores are the opposite of
corporate retailing: eccentric, stylish, brimming with local
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since the first Ricky's opened on Broadway near
Washington Place, the stores have become a favorite of fashion
designers and stylists. The house cosmetics line, Mattese
(pronounced inexplicably like the artist Matisse), is widely used
by makeup artists, who pair its vivid, modestly priced products
with high-end brands like Chanel.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity makeup artist Kevin Aucoin says he goes in as
often as three times a month to buy the house brand of cotton swabs
and other tools of the trade. ``I love it from the minute you walk
in,'' he said, alluding to the sign over the door, a huge,
undulating sequined tube of toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky's not only is the first to get new beauty products and
downtown looks on its shelves, but also, some fashion insiders say,
sometimes starts trends. ``They are really phenomenally forward,''
the designer Betsey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The makeup artist Bobbi Brown, whose line of cosmetics is sold
at Barneys and Saks Fifth Avenue, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky's is like our version of going to all those little
cosmetic places in Paris,'' she said. ``It's very specifically New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the store is not, however, is a bargain bin.
Conventional products like toothpaste and aspirin are priced lower
than at tony emporiums like Bigelow Pharmacy in the Village, but
higher than at discount chains like CVS.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when chains are driving many independent drugstores
out of business, Ricky's strategy for survival is to offer a wider,
and wilder, selection of merchandise at premium prices. ``You
really can't make money selling aspirin,'' Kenig said. ``But you
can make money selling body paint and vibrators.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the NC-17 tinge of some merchandise, it may be surprising
to learn that Ricky's is a family business. Al Kenig, Ricky Kenig's
father, is a former junkyard owner, who opened one of the first
discount beauty stores in the Bronx in the early 1970s after a
customer started paying him in truckloads of fragrances. Later, he
and a group of partners started Love's, a 25-store discount drug
chain in New York, which capitalized on the growing market for hair
and skin-care products.
</P>
<P>
   Al Kenig, 63, was never a conventional role model, either for
his children or for how to run a business. To advertise Love's, he
became a sponsor of Robin Byrd's cable television show on which
guests were interviewed nude. His first Love's, on Third Avenue
near 64th Street, was originally named Linda Love after Linda
Lovelace.
</P>
<P>
   Al Kenig made his two sons and two daughters work in the
business as they were growing up. Ricky Kenig recalled, like a
Rockefeller nostalgic about Standard Oil's early days, ``When he
had the store in the Bronx, he would send us out to buy up all the
Excedrin and Pepto-Bismol we could find at Kmart and then he'd mark
it up and resell it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Al Kenig sold his share in Love's and soon after opened
the first Ricky's, named for his older son, who dropped out of
college to manage it. He gave all the children shares in the store,
but the largest, 50 percent chunk, went to Ricky. It was Ricky's
idea, his father said, to cater to a downtown market and build ``an
antichain.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in addition to the original store, Ricky Kenig owns the
controlling share of the Soho store on Broadway, near Houston
Street. Todd Kenig, 35, his younger brother, owns half of the
stores on Broadway and 58th Street and at Eighth Street near Greene
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Al Kenig and another partner from the Love's days own one other
Ricky's, on Avenue of the Americas near 11th Street. ``Mostly these
days I just try to provide a little inspiration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Staying tirelessly trendy is a full-time job for the Kenigs. The
displays in the stores change almost every week, with merchandise
categories shifting to match the hipness food chain. (Hair
accessories are moving steadily toward the back after a year in the
prime spot near the door.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The hair butterflies, we had them two years ago,'' Ricky Kenig
said. ``The chains just got them, like, last month. And yo-yos? I
heard some of the hard-core rappers mention them in the songs, so I
got them in here. Now, when they are totally over, Duane Reade is
getting them in.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago when he was vacationing on Fire Island,
Ricky saw that the old-fashioned general store in Fair Harbor
carried penny candy. He decided on the spot it was time for the
retro-sweets to make a comeback among his jaded teen-age customers.
Next week, he will open a 10-foot section with everything from
edible wax lips, pixie sticks and those sugar dots on paper. ``Ten
minutes after I saw it out there, I knew it was right,'' he said.
``And I was on the phone a minute later setting it up. If you don't
move fast in a business like this, it's over before it begins.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Kenig's ambition is to export his quirky New York chain to
the rest of the world. Tourists already clog the stores, gripping
articles ripped from fashion magazines that mention the store.
Mattese is sold in 96 stores in Japan, and the Kenigs are working
on a deal to take a selection of snazzily packaged Ricky's New York
products to London. They think stores would work in Los Angeles and
Seattle, too.
</P>
<P>
   One thing they are sure of is that watering down the stores'
funk quotient would not be wise. In the mid-1990s, they opened
stores in neighborhoods like Murray Hill and the Upper West Side.
They let the managers tailor the product mix to a mainstream
clientele. Last year, they closed all six stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did wrong was try to compete with the chain stores
nearby,'' Ricky Kenig said. ``That was a complete mistake. What we
came to realize is that the further we get from doing what they do,
the better it is for us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At Damian Loeb's spare TriBeCa studio on a recent
Saturday night, Loeb, a painter, was putting some final strokes on
a work for an upcoming show in London. His best friend, Richard
Hall, the electronic music star known as Moby, zoned out before a
large-screen television hooked up to a spy camera, allowing him to
watch people walking by on the street, a form of entertainment that
Loeb prefers to real television.
</P>
<P>
   When they get together, the two friends refer to themselves as a
sort of ``Beavis and Butt-head'' of the downtown art scene. The
sophomoric humor, fits of giggles and talk of hot babes that
followed through this night could have been called an episode of
``Moby and Loeb.''
</P>
<P>
   Loeb, tall, lean and handsome, and Moby, short, wiry and
elflike, have been buddies since they met at a church dance in
Greenwich, Conn. Moby was a fledgling deejay, Loeb a gawky
teen-ager too shy to dance. In 1987, they packed up a U-Haul and
headed to New York to find fortune and fame. Now, they both have.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Moby, 33, was preparing to embark on a world tour
for his critically acclaimed new CD, ``Play.'' For Loeb, 28, after
a decade of scraping by, he hit it big this year, with a sold-out
show at the Mary Boone Gallery in January and a flurry of
attention. (Moby is still one of Loeb's biggest collectors. ``By
default,'' Loeb said. ``He helped me pay the rent, so when my
paintings were worth something, I started paying him back.'')
</P>
<P>
   On the way to a dinner party on Gramercy Park, they stopped at a
deli. Loeb, in gray slacks and beaded sandals, picked up a pack of
Dunhill cigarettes. Moby, in a pair of cutoff corduroy shorts and a
T-shirt, bought a 12-pack of toilet paper as a hostess gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going to be house-o-vegans is it?'' Loeb asked
Moby, who is an animal-rights activist and a vegan and says he is a
descendant of Herman Melville.
</P>
<P>
   In the taxi, the voice of Nicole Miller urged them to buckle up.
``Hey, she's got one of my paintings!'' said Loeb, who seemed
surprised by his newfound success.
</P>
<P>
   At the party, an intimate gathering in the apartment of Tatiana
Von Furstenberg, where a filmmaker friend of Moby's was
house-sitting, the hostess read aloud from a psychiatric desk
reference. Moby asked whether there was any explanation for the
panic attacks he suffers from the idea of romantic commitment.
</P>
<P>
   With that, three more men arrived, bringing the count to 8 men
and 1 woman. Moby commented that the party was starting to resemble
a Promise Keepers meeting, and the two restless bachelors said
their goodbyes. They went to Gavin Brown, a bar on West 15th Street
that has disco lights in the floor and is popular with artists.
</P>
<P>
   After one drink and a round of ``Simpsons'' trivia, they moved
their party back to Moby's loft, on Mott Street. En route, they
stopped at another deli for supplies: Loeb bought whole grain
cereal and a bag of chips; Moby got a rubber ball, which he whacked
against the walls of buildings.
</P>
<P>
   On Moby's roof, the two sat in a hammock. Moby talked about what
he was going to play on ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' several
days later. Loeb munched on Doritos and remarked on how ridiculous
it is that the chips ad features a sexy model.
</P>
<P>
   ``No hot women ever eat Doritos,'' he said. ``It makes your
breath stink and your fingers turn orange.'' Moby pointed out a
penthouse that he said Sting is building a few blocks away. ``There
goes the neighborhood,'' Loeb said, grabbing his cereal boxes and
heading home.

LIFE IN THE DIET BLENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 1)  
(EDS: Opening graf should be in italics) 
(lh) 
 By MARTHA McCULLY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reluctantly, I have agreed to go out to dinner with friends.
This is going to be tricky. I plan to arrive at the restaurant
early. When I get there, the antipasto table mocks me. I quickly
head past it into the bathroom for refuge. In the privacy of the
cramped room, I unpack my purse and create my liquid meal: 8 ounces
of skim milk, a packet of vitamin-rich Sustacal (the powder
hospitals administer to patients whose jaws are wired shut) and two
capfuls of fish oil, dispensed from a dark brown bottle. In my
portable plastic container, I shake it up, then drink it down,
praying no one comes in. Aaaah. I can now sit with my friends, pick
on a dry salad and pretend I'm enjoying life.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, I have tried every diet from
Cambridge to Scarsdale and every weight-loss gimmick from
inflatable leg massagers to acupuncture needles in my ears (which
were supposed to enhance serotonin and suppress my appetite).
</P>
<P>
   My motivation was both personal (I am a former chemistry nerd
who truly loves nutrition) and professional (for years, I was a
beauty and health editor at a women's magazine, where it was my
duty to experience the latest and greatest). I developed my
nutritional acumen to the point where I stunned the folks promoting
olestra when I was the only person in a series of meetings to
detect the fake fat in a potato chip.
</P>
<P>
   I was never trying to starve myself, or even to feel hungry.
Unlike the Stairmaster-crazed, Snackwell's-obsessed thinnies in
this city, my travels from fat-free to fen-phen, from algae pills
to acupuncture, protein to Rice Dream, were not mapped out simply
to lose 10 extra pounds. I wanted to be in control of my health.
It's the modern version of mastering one's destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Like all women, I was a little more than influenced by my
parents in my food behavior. They were always focused on eating but
truly in a healthy way. My father is a pioneer in the world of
heart-disease research, and my mother has been preparing meals
filled with antioxidants and B vitamins for 30 years. As a child, I
was given frozen vegetables as snacks. I had never heard of candy
before age 6.
</P>
<P>
   Like most teen-agers, I needed to rebel, and I did so through
food. Even though I was perfectly thin and athletic, I went to Diet
Workshop, the Jenny Craig of the 1970s, for the sense of community.
I begged my parents to send me to a hypnotist for weight loss.
(They sensibly refused.) I lived on Tab.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it's not at all unusual for a teen-age girl to become
fixated on food and eating, and one hopes that her food issues will
never become life issues. But my childhood fascination with food
and nutrition developed into a 20-year pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   At Allure magazine, I was a human guinea pig. I binged on books
for foodies: ``Outsmarting the Female Fat Cell,'' ``The
Carbohydrate Addict's Diet,'' ``Fat Is a Family Affair,'' ``Super
Nutrition for Women.'' I turned diets into stories, gimmicks into
trends. Acupuncture for Cellulite! Laci Le Beau Tea: Instant
Diuretic! Colorad! Metabalance! Trident by the Value Pack!
</P>
<P>
   Each new diet regime was accompanied by the thrill of hope.
Maybe this blind date would be Mr. Right. When Chinese herbs were
in vogue, I carried a Prada pouch filled with Herbaswee and
Soy-Futura, dispensing dropperfuls of brown liquid into my Evian in
four-star restaurants. (I still have an unidentifiable headache
that I swear is an herbal hangover. Serves me right.)
</P>
<P>
   I entered my 30s armed with more knowledge about nutrition than
some nutritionists. My reading was more advanced: the Berkeley
Wellness Letter replaced ``When Food Is Love.'' I gave up the
gimmicks and flings and strove for committed relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Fat-free was my first true love. I bought vintage balsamic
vinegar in an attempt to glorify my oil-free salads, scoured
cookbooks for lean cuisine recipes and substituted fat-free yogurt
wherever I could. Like so many other women in the early 1990s, I
believed in the mantra that fat makes you fat.
</P>
<P>
   Going out in New York was no longer fun, it was a dare. If the
vegetables were shiny (a telltale sign of oil), they were sent
back. ``Are you sure that's skim milk in my cappuccino?'' Don't
touch that dessert menu! Waiters feared me; friends were appalled.
But if I remained virtuous, I won. Or so I thought.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, fat-free wasn't for me. Cranky and constipated, I
was living on Tasti D-Lite and scooped-out bagels. Steamed
vegetables, steamed fish, steamed life. I remember the Easter when
my mother, trying to accommodate my demands, abolished pasta and
made a fat-free ricotta cheese pie. I would now like to apologize
to the rest of my family for that.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After having lived fat-free, it was easy to give up other food
groups. Over the years, I have abstained from more foods than most
people indulge in. Coffee was the easiest, followed by soda, then
fizzy water, pasta, alcohol, Nutrasweet, bread, flour and sugar.
(What a blissful reunion I've had lately with Nutrasweet and San
Pellegrino.)
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining some sanity, I never attempted to give up chocolate.
Visiting my parents, I would pack Wasa crackers, protein powder and
herbs. ``Just have some chicken,'' my mother would say _ at every
meal.
</P>
<P>
   Was I crazy? Not really. Extreme? Perhaps. But like so many
other women in their teens, 20s, 30s, 40s (not our entire lives, I
hope), my relationship with food is complex. It is part
psychological, part schizophrenic, part symptomatic of some anxiety
I'll probably never understand.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling as a food fanatic was a challenge. What? No protein at
breakfast in Venice? I'll pack powdered egg whites. Snacks in
Paris? I'll bring my own Laughing Cow Lite. The feeling of
outsmarting the system was fulfilling. But who was I outsmarting?
And for what? Still, with the strength of a stealth mission, I
persevered. For months, my morning drink was a
hot-water-lemon-cayenne-maple-syrup cocktail designed to cleanse
the kidneys. Spending a night at a boyfriend's apartment, I packed
clean underwear and a lemon. When in Europe for the fashion shows,
I lived for days on protein powder frothed up by a battery-operated
blender.
</P>
<P>
   I should have found a better use of my energy years earlier, but
I didn't. It was about not only calories and carbohydrates, but
also enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The food gurus of New York _ diet doctors and professional
nutritionists _ were my mentors. I could lecture on the pros and
cons of orlistat, Optifast and olestra. I spent months seeing a
hypnotist, who taught me to breathe deeply while in the back seat
of a taxi, repeating to myself, ``Sugar is not my friend.'' I wrote
down every food that passed my lips for years at a time, each
nutritionist scrutinizing my choices as if he were grading a test.
</P>
<P>
   Then one guru led me astray. Consuming upward of 40 vitamins,
mineral supplements and thyroid pills a day, I overdosed.
Literally. My legs hurt, my joints ached, I couldn't exercise, and
I was having trouble walking. My internist took one look at me and
knew what was going on. I had to stop the insanity.
</P>
<P>
   I went cold turkey. No more supplements, no more pills. I sold
my portable blender in a yard sale and threw out tubs of Designer
Protein. I decided to listen to my body and to my mind. Combining
the simplest, most intelligent information I had acquired over 20
years, I put together my own way of eating _ mostly protein and
vegetables, very few refined carbohydrates. Some would call it a
protein diet, but since I no longer use the word diet, I just have
to say this is the way I eat. And then something amazing happened.
I actually started to feel different, better, not deprived, but
satisfied. I lost weight; I felt more energetic.
</P>
<P>
   I called my parents and excitedly described my insights: Limit
refined carbs! Chicken at every meal! They listened patiently, just
as they had for more than 30 years. They let me go on and on, just
as parents do when their child decides, on her own, to go to their
alma mater. They never once said, ``We told you so.'' They promised
to try my new regime, as my mother called it. Of course they really
didn't have to change. After all, this was how they ate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   My food journey is over. For the last four years, I have eaten
in a balanced, healthy way. I no longer crave peanut M&AMP;Ms; I don't
plan tomorrow night's dinner at today's breakfast. I never found
the pot of gold or the Holy Grail. But I did find the secret. Just
like Dorothy's in ``The Wizard of Oz,'' it was there all the time.
There is no place like home _ especially when it comes to food.

DATE NIGHT, N.Y.: FROM LUVSURVEYS TO HULA HOOPS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JULIA CHAPLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As if New York's bars and clubs didn't have enough
singles rubbing elbows and noses, some of them are taking
mating-mixology to the next level: mixer bashes disguised as theme
nights.
</P>
<P>
   Forget fern bars and zinfandel. Trendy night spots have been
giving singles parties a hipster makeover, with all the giggly
savvy of a generation weaned on too many episodes of ``The Dating
Game'' and MTV's bawdy update, ``Singled Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown weekly events like ``Punk Rock Karaoke,'' held at
Arlene's Grocery, and the Hula Hoop competition at the Tortilla
Flats restaurant have a decidedly kitschy edge. They are a backlash
against chichi clubs, where locating your soul mate _ providing you
can make it past the velvet ropes _ can be as unnerving as a job
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if you're a fat old man or a model, it's
still hard to meet people in the city,'' said Trang Choung, 26, a
research editor at Marie Claire magazine, who gives campy Monday
night parties at the downtown club Veruka. ``We offer games and
alcohol to get the crowd past those first awkward stages, and then
they're left to their own devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the offerings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MOTHRA (Monday nights at B Bar; 358 Bowery, at Fourth Street; $5
cover)
</P>
<P>
   At Mothra, the weekly social named after the radioactive insect
that battled Godzilla, Audrey Bernstein has been the hostess of ice
breakers like a retro ski party and an India-themed dress-up party.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, a contest sponsored by Playboy magazine was held
with prizes bestowed in the categories of ``hairiest chest,''
``shortest shorts'' and ``naughtiest nightgown.'' The actors
Laurence Fishburne and Tony Danza and 1964's Playmate of the Year
all came out for the spectacle, which featured a king-size bed
covered with red velvet, set up in the garden for photos by
Mothra's photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't find a date,'' lamented Jane Pratt, the editor in
chief of Jane magazine, who wore a low-cut dress and silver high
heels. ``But the cool part was you could pretend you were making
fun of everything but in reality you got to lie in a huge bed with
a cute guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Overheard pickup line: ``Will you pose for me?''
</P>
<P>
   Turn-ons: Possibility of meeting Gene Simmons of Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Turnoffs: Possibility of going home with Gene Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtrack: Remixed retro classics like Madonna's 1980's hit
``Burning Up,'' played at low speed, and a dance hall version of
Barry Manilow's ``Copacabana.''
</P>
<P>
   Dress code: Retro sexy. For women, Daryl K hip-huggers and
slinky disco gold halter tops. For men, cheap Guayabera shirts and
$400 Gucci khakis, Ray-Ban aviator shades, sideburns optional.
</P>
<P>
   VERUKA (Monday nights; 525 Broome Street, at Thompson Street; no
cover)
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have trouble meeting girls anyway,'' sniffed Tim
Durant, 25, a model with a Hamptons' tan, nursing a martini at a
recent singles party at Veruka.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Durant volunteered for the makeshift ``Dating
Game,'' where he was asked questions like: ``If you were an animal,
what would your mating call be?'' Trang Chuong and Kathy
Szwedzinski have been throwing these love-connection fetes with a
'70s nostalgia feel for the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Past events have included Twister floor games, a
bachelor/bachelorette party with kissing games like spin the bottle
and truth or dare, and a matchmaking exercise where revelers wear
numbered tags and check a bulletin board to see if any secret
admirers have left a message.
</P>
<P>
   Overheard pickup line: Too loud to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Turn-ons: Might get to kiss a model.
</P>
<P>
   Turnoffs: He/she might be wearing braces.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtrack: Bittersweet make-out anthems like Human League's
``Don't You Want Me?'' and Elvis' ``Crazy Little Thing Called
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Dress code: Fashionably cute. For women, the models' favorite,
Earl Jeans (size 26 waist), and a DKNY tube top. For men, anything
by Helmut Lang, bright Nike sandals.
</P>
<P>
   LUVBUZZ (1438 Third Avenue, at 82d Street; no cover)
</P>
<P>
   This new Upper East Side bar promises ``the end of the frat boy
singles bar scene,'' but so far it attracts many more women than
men. Maybe the guys aren't that comfortable amid the suggestive
decor _ heart-colored love seats, Latex curtains and honeycomb
motifs _ surrounding the computer monitors and digital cameras that
are part of the bar's elaborate ``Date-a-Base'' system.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons are encouraged to fill out a Luvsurvey, which asks for
personal information like the celebrity you are most often compared
with. Your image is then fed into a computer, and a ``Luvhandle''
is assigned to you. If a match is made on line, either between
patrons across the room or those using the Web site from home, the
staff, or Luvbuzz bees, will arrange a date at Luvbuzz.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people were sitting home behind their computers and
having online chats instead of face-to-face dating,'' said Cathy
Cervenka, the director for digital media and dating systems at
Luvbuzz, during a recent round of ``boozy bingo,'' one of the
quirky theme parties, held on Monday evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Overheard pickup line: ``I bet you own an iMac.''
</P>
<P>
   Turn-ons: Men manly enough to be seen slurping Buzz Cones, like
Sno-Kones with alcohol, through licorice whips.
</P>
<P>
   Turnoffs: Lovelorn singles with carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtrack: Sentimental favorites from Sarah McLachlan to Dean
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Dress code: Office casual. For women, Prada nylon backpacks and
Calvin Klein solid-colored slimming separates. For men, Calvin
Klein's CK One cologne, loosened ties.
</P>
<P>
   TORTILLA FLATS (Wednesday night Hula Hoop competition; 767
Washington Street, at 12th Street; no cover)
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been this much excitement since Siegfried met
Roy!'' said Steve Pagnotta, the pajama-clad emcee at the Hula Hoop
competition held at this Greenwich Village restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Here, under the dusty Christmas lights, secretaries, magazine
editors and stockbrokers gather with meat-packing district locals,
and attempt to twirl the hoop for a full three minutes without
knocking into platters of refried beans. (The winner gets
short-lived fame and a free pitcher of margaritas.)
</P>
<P>
   The scene on a recent Wednesday: a guy resembling Fabio with an
open-to-the-waist silk shirt gyrated a pink hoop to the Weather
Girls' hit ``It's Raining Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Overheard pickup line: ``Hey, baby, uh ...'' (too drunk to
complete the thought).
</P>
<P>
   Turn-ons: Hula Hoopers are surprisingly approachable.
</P>
<P>
   Turnoffs: Hula Hoopers too drunk to remember your name five
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtrack: Led Zeppelin's ``When the Levee Breaks'' and ``Ring
My Bell'' by Anita Ward, blared to distortion.
</P>
<P>
   Dress code: Business dishabille. For women, office gear modified
for Hula Hooping, i.e. buttoned shirts tied in a French knot above
the navel, heels removed for lower center of gravity. For men, a
Brooks Brothers suit with the jacket dangling in spilt sour mix.

<P>
   PUNK ROCK KARAOKE (Monday nights at Arlene's Grocery; 95 Stanton
Street; no cover)
</P>
<P>
   When VH-1 recently taped a pilot show called ``Celebrity
Karaoke,'' based on the longstanding sing-along night at the Elbow
Room, a club in Greenwich Village, there were bound to be some
grumblings from the underground. The truly alternative Punk Rock
Karaoke, held at Arlene's Grocery, has become the place to be seen
and to make the scene for nostalgic punks and the grungy East
Village set.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the lo-fi nature of the genre, there's a grumpy
emcee with an English accent who insults would-be participants, and
a live band that accompanies the amateurs, who read songs off
homemade lyric sheets instead of monitors. Although Punk Rock
Karaoke is not specifically billed as a singles party, people do
turn out to mosh and mingle.
</P>
<P>
   For punk aficionados nothing seems to be sexier than seeing a
member of the opposite sex belt out ``God Save the Queen'' by the
Sex Pistols, said Trisha Mulcahy, the bleached-blond lead singer of
a band named Superlux. At a recent Monday night party, she wore
silver sequined pants and a white T-shirt that she ripped freshly
for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time I tried very hard to look cool,'' Ms. Mulcahy
said, after a well-received version of the Clash hit ``I Fought the
Law.'' ``But then it got boring. Now, I find it much sexier to
snarl and scream at the top of your lungs.''
</P>
<P>
   Overheard pickup line: ``I bet you'd look fantastic singing Iggy
Pop's ``I Wanna Be Your Dog!''
</P>
<P>
   Turn-ons: Visualize yourself as the star of VH-1's ``Where Are
They Now?''
</P>
<P>
   Turnoffs: Good chance of sustaining irreversible hearing loss.
Creepy guys from failed punk rock bands trying to get a free beer.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtrack: Full catalog of songs from the Stooges and the
Misfits.
</P>
<P>
   Dress code: Clashing loudly. For women, either too much eyeliner
and ripped fishnets or the clean sexy look of the sitcom
``Friends.'' For men, combat boots, despite the heat, and torn
concert T-shirts.

SINGER STEPS OUT FROM SHADOW OF `ALLY MCBEAL' 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JOHN BECK   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vonda Shepard, the ``Ally McBeal'' lounge muse, is spending the
summer venue-hopping all over the country and into Europe, playing
casinos, amphitheaters, county fairs and nightclubs, as well as
Chicago's House of Blues and even Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shepard is out supporting her fifth CD, ``By 7:30,'' and
planning her next moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night is different,'' she says, taking a one-day break
from the road in her West Los Angeles Spanish-style villa. ``You
never know what you're going to walk into.''
</P>
<P>
   These days the unknown is not as daunting for her, especially
after serendipity led to her ``discovery'' _ after she had already
recorded three albums _ in a Los Angeles club where Michelle
Pfeiffer and her husband television producer David E. Kelley caught
her sultry song-and-keyboard routine. Not long after, Kelley tapped
her to fill the role of a recurring Boston bar singer who voices
the internal monologue that guides a young lawyer by the name of
Ally McBeal.
</P>
<P>
   After several seasons with ``Ally McBeal,'' her long blond locks
and TV cover tunes are more familiar than most of her original
work.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unscripted dream and yet a frustrating separation: She's
a musician, and she plays one on television, except it's not
exactly herself. On one hand, she's stroking the keys for 10
million viewers a week. On the other, although she coined the
show's theme song, ``Searchin' My Soul,'' she spends much of her
time learning and playing cover songs like Blue Suede's ``Hooked on
a Feeling'' and Left Banke's ``Walk Away Renee.''
</P>
<P>
   Resembling a young Carly Simon (``We both have big lips and big
teeth and smallish eyes'') she's recognized by fans on the streets
of Los Angeles even when her hair is ``ratty, a sure sign you've
made it'' _ but they don't often know her latest tunes.
</P>
<P>
   At 36, she is gearing up for another television season and a
second ``Ally McBeal'' song collection; nonetheless, the inevitable
next installment is looming: Life after ``Ally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder about it all the time,'' she says. ``My life is so
consumed with it. I really have two careers ... I know that it's
going to end someday so I don't want to push it away too soon. I
want to appreciate it and get the most out of it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   More than just a launching pad, the show has grown into a
valuable learning experience. `` `Ally' uses more of the left side
of my brain.'' she says. ``It's a lot more craft-oriented. And I
spend a lot of time working in the studio as a producer not just a
singer.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, Ms. Shepard was raised in Los Angeles by her
father, who was a mime, and her mom, a model. She began piano
lessons at 6, taking a class with her three siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of weird people sleeping on the couches because
of my dad's Bohemian, artsy lifestyle, and one of them was a woman
who was a singer/songwriter,'' she says. ``She was 19 and I was
like 7 or 8 and she would play these songs that she wrote, so I
started writing songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father introduced her to the studio at 10, and a music
journalist set up her first gig at 14. She began singing backup for
Rickie Lee Jones at 19, later harmonizing with Jackson Browne.
</P>
<P>
   After last year's successful ``Songs From `Ally McBeal,''' she
weathered the rite-of-passage record label bidding war, but chose
the independent label route, opting for artistic control above all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that if I had signed with any major label they wouldn't
let me put out a new record this soon and they wouldn't let me make
this record. They would want to put me in the extreme pop category
... I love pop music, but I don't want to be Celine Dion.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking its name from the manifest ultimatum: ``By 7:30 you'll
fall in love with me,'' her latest CD weaves a tightknit diary of
introspective songs wavering mellifluously between overblown
independence and recurring vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a throwback to Carole King, Ms. Shepard's pulpit is the
white blues piano confessional, revolving around a desperate need
for human contact (``No girl is an island,'' she sings) and the
weight of hollow, spent relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The most polished radio-groomed song on the CD parades as the
catchy duet with Indigo Girls' Emily Saliers, ``Baby, Don't You
Break My Heart Slow.''
</P>
<P>
   When she met the Indigo Girls backstage before a show at Los
Angeles' Greek Theatre, ``Emily came running up to me and said, `Oh
my God, I love that song `Baby, Don't You Break My Heart Slow' on
your first album.' She said, `Will you do it in our show tonight?'
I had never met her, and she asked me to sing it by myself in front
of 8,500 people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shepard wound up playing ``The Wildest Times of the World''
that night, but later, while opening for the Indigo Girls on tour,
she and Ms. Saliers often belted out the ``Baby Don't You Break My
Heart Slow'' together.
</P>
<P>
   After the success of ``Songs From `Ally McBeal,''' taking new
original material on the road posed a healthy challenge. ``I was a
little insecure about it at first,'' she says. ``I didn't know how
open-minded the `Ally' people would be.''
</P>
<P>
   But, so far the tour has drawn a gathering of musical converts
and gawking TV fans loaded with requests. The only missing
ingredient at each venue is a single-sex bathroom where fans can
compare notes as the characters do on ``Ally McBeal.''

 &HT;    PENTAGON OVERPAYS CONTRACTORS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Defense Department overpaid its top
contractors who then took an average of a year to refund $56
million to the government, says a new congressional investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 13 major contractors disclosed that some companies
retained overpayments for months after they were discovered by
their accounting departments because the government did not ask for
refunds. One contractor accumulated excess payments of $627,000
dating back seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, government personnel were aware of
overpayments, but they did not take timely action to obtain
recovery,'' said the report, issued Friday by the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. The study
noted that federal law does not require a company to return the
funds until the government demands a refund.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the latest detailing double payments and other
accounting problems in the department, focused on the Defense
Finance and Accounting Service at Columbus, Ohio, which pays most
of the Pentagon's bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``These accounting oversights are inexcusable,'' said Sen. Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations
subcommittee. The Department of Defense ``should hunt down these
overpaid contractors and say, 'show me the money,' `` Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department, responding to the congressional report,
agreed that it could identify excess payments more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Such accounting shortcomings are not new. Between 1994 and 1998,
defense contractors returned about $4.6 billion to the Columbus
center, which has attributed most of the overspending to factors
outside of its control. However, the congressional study said that
some payment errors were made at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the report cited a ``growing backlog of contracts''
that have not been examined for possible overpayments. As of last
January, more than 2,450 contracts were still not reconciled by
defense officials. The longer it takes to reconcile those accounts,
the longer it will take to discover excess payments and obtain
refunds, the congressional study said.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 companies that were the focus of the latest study
represent only a microcosm of the overpayment problem at the
Defense Department. Contractors are paid hundreds of millions of
dollars in excess each year, with the total of refunds to the
Columbus center reaching $746 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies in the study: Lockheed Martin's Tactical
Aircraft Systems and Bell Helicopter's Textron division, both of
Fort Worth, Texas; Harris Corporation's Electronic Systems Sector
of Melbourne, Fla., Raytheon of Bedford, Mass.; and Boeing's Long
Beach, Calif., division.

Walton, the legendary founder of the Arkansas-based chain, entering
the store with one of his executives. ``Hi, how are you, glad to
see you,'' an old gentleman stationed at the store's entrance said
to Walton. ``If there's anything I can tell you about our store,
let me know.'' That was nearly 20 years ago, says John Bisio, a
Wal-Mart spokesman. Bisio adds, ``Mr. Walton was inspired by the
idea and wanted to expand it.'' Today, there is at least one
``greeter'' _ usually a senior citizen _ at each of the chain's
2,450 stores, a concept that is catching on across the country as
businesses try to survive in a more competitive marketplace. By

<P>
   So, what are they doing? They're declaring that some of the
spending they want qualifies as an ``emergency,'' a designation
that conveniently allows lawmakers to ignore those budget caps.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they're counting as an emergency $4.5 billion in
census spending, along with $3 billion for veterans' health care
for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who favor a more modest tax cut, are having a field
day mocking Republicans, saying it's ridiculous to suggest that
either item qualifies as an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decennial census?'' asked House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, noting that it must be conducted every 10 years. ``What's
unforeseen about that?''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., said the semantic
gymnastics only underscore what he sees at the ultimate fallacy in
the tax-cut debate - that there is a budget surplus to enjoy.
Indeed, the so-called surplus only exists because lawmakers count
the revenues from various trust funds, including Social Security,
which are supposed to be off limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cut out the monkeyshine,'' Hollings declared. ``We don't have
any revenues to lose. Everybody knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   TAXING TIMES
</P>
<P>
   It is a tough time for Southern Democratic conservatives and
moderates in Congress. They want to back some tax cuts and they
want to go a little farther than some of their Democratic
colleagues. But they don't want to sign on to what they see as a
fiscally reckless $792 billion proposal embraced by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to broker a deal, some joined forces with
like-minded GOP moderates in the Senate to advance a compromise
$500 billion package they described as the middle ground between
the GOP position and the Democratic and Clinton administration
approach. Without each side giving a little ground, said Sen. John
Breaux, D-La., nothing is likely to be signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, in a bipartisan way, can avoid the financial train
wreck,'' said Breaux, who was joined in advancing his proposal by
Louisiana colleague Mary Landrieu and Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C.,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   Other Southerners believe Congress should not offer any tax
relief until it guarantees the survival of both Social Security and
Medicare and pays down the debt. In the House, members of the Blue
Dog Coalition, including such conservative Democrats as Bud Cramer
of Alabama, Chris John of Louisiana and Mike McIntyre of North
Carolina, opposed the GOP tax cut package.
</P>
<P>
   With midsummer policy fights reaching a fever pitch on Capitol
Hill, Breaux proposed a cooling-off period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggest that before we pass an $800 billion tax bill and
send it to the president for a certain veto, we take a break and
spend the August recess listening to our constituents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GRIM HARVEST
</P>
<P>
   With low prices and restricted access to foreign markets,
farmers everywhere are suffering this summer. And Southern
lawmakers feel their pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers are having a very rough time,'' said Democratic Rep.
Mike McIntyre, who said that his nine-county district in
southeastern North Carolina has lost 706 farms over six years.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre and other lawmakers blame the Freedom to Farm Act,
which was enacted in 1996 and eliminated price supports and
guarantees for most crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is we are in a global economy and other countries
around the world continue to subsidize their farmers at rates
between 30 and 40 percent,'' McIntyre said. ``Other countries also
have strict quotas and tariffs on imports. As long as they do that,
we don't have a level playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are working on a variety of remedies, including some
short-term loan relief and expanding a conservation program that
compensates farmers who limit their production.
</P>
<P>
   A more permanent solution, McIntyre said, lies in revamping the
Freedom to Farm Act, which comes up for renewal in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't wait that long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GET DOWN, GET DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Oh those funky Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to demonstrate their hipness, Florida GOP leaders have
lined up a name musical act for their October convention in Orlando
_ site of a presidential candidate's forum. Their choice? Kool and
the Gang, a 70s disco group best known for the song, ``Celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   That should stop all the talk about Republicans not being
terribly with it.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this IMAX film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' R (sexuality, sexual dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan and Chris Klein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a raunchy, throwaway, pre-adult, R-rated high school
sexcapade with dirty dialogue and more than one risque encounter
between students that's broadcast over the Internet. There's also
the grossest joke involving a beer you're likely ever to see on
film. Little in ``American Pie'' deserves honest laughs. (Bob
Longino)1 hour, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Arlington Road'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack
</P>
<P>
   and Jeff Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's marred by patches of obviousness, ``Arlington Road''
arrives in theaters with a sharp sense of timing. It's a variation
of Alfred Hitchcock's chilling 1943 film ``Shadow of a Doubt,''
hot-wired to a national nervous system that's already jolted by
heavily armed teenage commandos and Midwestern spree shooters. (SM)
1 hour, 57 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy
</P>
<P>
   Who Shagged Me'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mike Myers
</P>
<P>
   and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's fave dentally impaired British superspy, Mike
Myers goes back to the '60s to save his mojo from Dr. Evil and a
giant slob in a kilt (Myers and Myers, respectively). Shaggy but
still shagadelic, this worthy sequel also stars Heather Graham as a
curvy CIA operative, Seth Green as Dr. Evil's brooding son Scott
and Jerry Springer (don't ask). (SM) 1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler
</P>
<P>
   and Joey Lauren Adams.
</P>
<P>
   It's Adam Sandler's latest moneymaker. ``Big Daddy'' ties
together elements from his successful date movie ``The Wedding
Singer'' (boyish innocence and charm to woo the women in the
audience) and his even more successful yukfest ``The Waterboy''
(scatological scatting just for the boys). Throw in an itty-bitty
kid for Sandler to pal around with and you've got the makings of a
mack-daddy movie. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 35 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Heather Donahue,
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It's a journey into the kind of terror that comes from trying to
glimpse something in the shadows just beyond the campfire. Three
students head into the woods to document an 18th-century witch
tale, then disappear. The movie wrings chills out of the slightest
effects _ odd twiglike contraptions hanging from trees, a pile of
stones, strange noises in the night _ but its power comes from
psychological intensity. (SM)1 hour, 27 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Blue Sea'' R (excessive gore, dismemberment)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   There is precious little that is original about this movie. It
really doesn't matter, though. When the plot kicks in and the
killer shark starts prowling and munching, the film delivers all
the thrills, explosive action and sheer gore that audiences have
come to expect from the shark genre. (Hap Erstein, Cox News
Service) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' PG-13 (profanity, sex-related material,
</P>
<P>
   crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst,
</P>
<P>
   Denise Richards, Kirstie Alley
</P>
<P>
   and Ellen Barkin.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cheerfully mean-spirited spoof of beauty pageants.
Remember 1975's ``Smile''? Except for a switch from cheerleading to
beauty pageants, the plot here is much the same as the 1993 cable
flick ``The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas
Cheerleader-Murdering Mom.'' ``Gorgeous'' stoops to obvious sight
gags and even broader performances than in ``Mom.'' (SM)1 hour, 37
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' R (profanity, sexual content, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   drug-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   The late Stanley Kubrick's final film is a letdown _ an often
frustrating peephole view at jealousy and sexual obsession that
confronts a rich New York couple (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman).
While it has its moments, its much-touted centerpiece orgy doesn't
work. What you get resembles Cirque du Soleil as performed by the
cast of ``Showgirls.'' (SM) 2 hours, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The General's Daughter'' R (profanity, violence, rape,
</P>
<P>
   sadomasochism)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta,
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Stowe and James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   As a warrant officer investigating the mysterious slaying of a
female captain, John Travolta bolts on screen, barking his lines
and spitting his machismo all over the place. Somebody's got to
turn this mess into a movie. Shot in Savannah and disguised as an
A-grade film, ``General's Daughter'' is an over-directed,
overwritten and ultimately underwhelming whodunit B-grade thriller.
(Bob Longino)1 hour, 55 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haunting'' PG-13 (intense horror sequences)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Scary in all the worst ways. ``The Haunting'' is a Hollywood
debacle, an overpriced mess with only one scare in it. That scare
is of the old-fashioned ``boo'' variety. It has nothing to do with
the over-the-top computer effects that make this less a remake of
the 1963 classic than a theme park in search of a script. (SM) 1
hour, 53 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' PG-13 (brief nudity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rupert Everett,
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett, Jeremy Northam
</P>
<P>
   and Julianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   A less-than-ideal adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play. In 1895
London, a respected politician's public and private lives are
threatened by a blackmailer who knows a secret from his past. The
fine cast is stymied by director Oliver Parker's literal-minded
approach. What remains is a well-acted, very well-appointed period
piece that becomes more stifling and less engaging as it goes
along. (ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget'' PG (wacky violence, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The best gag is the first one in Disney's big-screen version of
TV's popular animated part-human, part-machine, mucho-gizmo lawman.
Matthew Broderick is perfectly cast as Gadget. Rupert Everett goes
over the top as bad man Sanford Solex. Kids will enjoy watching
them both. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 20 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Placid'' R (profanity, violent creature attacks,
</P>
<P>
   gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Pullman,
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Fonda and Oliver Platt.
</P>
<P>
   In this sometimes watchable, underpopulated ``Jaws'' retread
about a giant crocodile, the croc attacks are predictable and
rudimentary. This is the sort of movie in which no one but bit
players get their heads bitten off. Pity. The scares aren't scary,
the laughs aren't funny, and poor Bridget Fonda has to keep falling
off moving vehicles directly into the path of the monster croc,
like some 1940s hapless heroine. (SM)1 hour, 22 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Muppets From Space'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring The Great Gonzo,
</P>
<P>
   Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.
</P>
<P>
   Beam us up, Gonzo. The Great Gonzo goes searching for his roots
and discovers he may have extraterrestrial family ties. It's the
same Muppet mania that's always worked _ a mix of vaudeville
shtick, kid-friendly slapstick and hilarious movie in-jokes to
tickle their parents. A perfect choice for families who may not be
quite ready to test ``South Park'' waters, but appreciate a blend
of sweetness and wit. (ERG) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant
</P>
<P>
   and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Boy gets movie star, boy loses movie star, etc. Hugh Grant plays
a decent London bookseller and Julia Roberts a version of herself
(worldwide movie star) in this romantic comedy. The latest from the
writer of ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' is old-fashioned hokum,
short on surprise but very long on charm. (SM) 2 hours, 4 minutes.
B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin'' Not rated, but contains
</P>
<P>
   nudity and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Girard's centuries-spanning saga follows the fortunes
and misfortunes of those who come in contact with the so-called Red
Violin, carved in 1681 by an Italian master. Holding the different
stories together is a present-day auction during which violin
expert Samuel L. Jackson struggles to unravel the instrument's
tragic secret. (ERG)2 hours, 10 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax ...
</P>
<P>
   It's Just Sex'' (Unrated, but contains profanity, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mitchell Anderson
</P>
<P>
   and Jennifer Tilly.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Anderson, Jennifer Tilly and Lori Petty star in this
big ensemble comedy-drama about a group of gay and straight friends
in Los Angeles, falling in and out of love. The repartee and
observations are often sharp and witty, but midway through the
movie loses its center and its focus. (SM) 1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Run Lola Run'' R (profanity and violence
</P>
<P>
   Starring Franka Potente
</P>
<P>
   and Moritz Bleibtreu.
</P>
<P>
   A pyrotechnic celebration of style over substance, this
adrenalin-fueled German flick is the big-screen love child of every
video game and MTV quick-cut editing trick of the past 10 years.
Franka Potente plays the flame-haired woman who has 20 minutes to
run through Berlin in search of 100,000 marks, or lose her lover.
In German with English subtitles. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   At Garden Hills. 1 hour, 21 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' PG (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning, alas, doesn't strike twice in this reunion of
``Pretty Woman'' stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. However, the
film isn't a fiasco and it does well by its intended audience,
i.e., anyone who wants to see Roberts galloping on horseback in
full wedding regalia. She's a bride who's already choked at the
altar three times and is about to try again. He's a cynical
journalist who's betting she'll run. (ERG) 1 hour, 56 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger,
</P>
<P>
   Longer &AMP; Uncut'' R (profanity, gross-out humor, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Trey Parker,
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stone and Mary Kay Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   It offers what you expect: crude animation, cruder humor. It's
probably the most offensive (and also funniest) bit of celluloid to
ever make moviegoers shell out $7. But in its timely, sly,
self-referential way, the movie is more than that. It's a witty
cultural artifact that captures the here and now of American media
obsessions, circa 1999. It should be put inside a time capsule.
(SM)1 hour, 21 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode I
</P>
<P>
   _ The Phantom Menace'' PG (sci-fi action/violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   Is George Lucas' new movie visually amazing? Yes. Exciting?
Sometimes. Emotionally involving? Almost never. As a technological
Mount Everest (and the Mount McKinley of marketing), ``Menace'' is
a
</P>
<P>
   remarkable achievement. Too bad writer-director Lucas left out
the gee-whiz enthusiasm of the original movies. He also left out
memorable characters. He left out the fun. (SM) 2 hours, 11
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of Sam'' R (profanity, sex, violence, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Leguizamo,
</P>
<P>
   Mira Sorvino and Adrien Brody.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Summer'' is definitely long but not so hot. Psycho David
Berkowitz's killing spree in New York's summer of '77 is just one
of many stories director Spike Lee tries to tell. Also in the mix
are rising tensions among some Italian-American homeboys in the
Bronx for whom it would already be a long, hot summer without the
added stress of a killer among them. (ERG) 2 hours, 22 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated film with voices
</P>
<P>
   by Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver,
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Close and Nigel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's animated ``Tarzan'' really swings. This long-haired
dude confidently surfs through Africa's immense rain forest. He
glides barefoot on never-ending, moss-covered tree limbs like the
coolest Rollerblader you've ever seen. His feet never fail him. His
movie doesn't either. Both a little scary and a lot funny, kids
will no doubt lap up this movie. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 28 minutes.
B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Known in 1930s Florence as ``the scorpioni,'' thanks to their
collective sting, a band of British and American expatriate women
become surrogate mothers of a young boy named Luca. Based on his
autobiography, director Franco Zeffirelli's film is an uneven but
enjoyable tale of a boy growing up in Black Shirt Italy, entrusted
to a handful of Auntie Mames. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)
40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Wild West'' PG-13 (action violence,
</P>
<P>
   sexual references, innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Smith,
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Avengers'' last summer, this tale of 1800s agent
James West, based on the old TV show, is a bizarre mix of
overproduced camp, sloppy pacing and tepid scripting. Will Smith
and Kevin Kline have zero sparks of buddy chemistry. ``Wild Wild
West'' is anything but wild. It's a washout. (SM)1 hour, 47
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
(Jill Vejnoska) At Fernbank Museum of Natural History. 41 minutes.
B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wood'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps,
</P>
<P>
   Taye Diggs and Richard T. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Friendship is what sets this movie apart from the usual genre
pigeonholing of African-American cliches and becomes something much
more universal. It's a male-bonding flick that transcends issues of
race. (SM) 1 hour, 46 minutes. B

 &HT;    Committed communists find God
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, August 1.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTANTA _ The gray-haired man in the 11th pew touched the tips
of his fingers to his forehead and to his breast, and then to each
shoulder. Many were making the sign of the cross in a hurried blur,
something done out of long habit, but Eugene Genovese made it with
the deliberation of a man who had given it hard thought. And when
he finished he knelt, head bowed, hands folded in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Saturday evening before the Fourth of July, and the
Cathedral of Christ the King in Buckhead was close to full.
Genovese had taken Holy Communion, as he does each week. At the
altar, his wife, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, a Eucharistic minister,
offered one communicant after another the wafer that Catholics
believe is the body of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   It is a well-to-do parish, the collection basket brimming with
tens, twenties, fifties and, on this particular Saturday, a check
for $100. In the back of the church a basket for the poor was
having to settle for one-dollar bills and a scattering of coins,
but few seemed to notice. Fewer still would have known that the
worshipper in their midst was, not so many years ago, a committed
Communist and his wife a feminist scholar with a Marxist point of
view. Not only that, but they had been nonbelievers most of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Long before they moved to Atlanta in 1986, Gene Genovese was
perhaps the best-known Marxist intellectual in the country. In the
1960s, President Richard Nixon tried to get him removed from the
faculty at Rutgers University because of his open support of the
Viet Cong. He joined the Communist Party of the United States of
America at age 15 and was a party organizer in New York City at 17.
Even in his mature years, he was a defender of Josef Stalin and of
the Soviet Union. He defended it, he says, ``until there was
nothing left to defend.''
</P>
<P>
   She is a historian who came to Atlanta as founder of the women's
studies program at Emory University, an intellectual who 20 years
ago was writing articles on the political dimensions of fashion for
journals such as Marxist Perspectives and Socialist Review.
</P>
<P>
   In May he turned 69 and she turned 58. He has retired, living
almost unnoticed in a money-minded city he calls gracious and
civilized, writing for a variety of periodicals, enjoying the
company of intellectuals on the right. But he is hardly a convert
to the free market _ which he says ``perverts the principle of
personal responsibility and promotes consumer choice as the arbiter
of moral and even spiritual values'' _ and he scoffs at those on
the left who think he has sold out. The conservatism he articulates
is rooted in the thoughts of John C. Calhoun and other antebellum
thinkers, not Newt Gingrich or Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   She still teaches history at Emory and still has an eye for
fashion, and wears plenty of it. But the convictions they live by
are grounded in an authority their old friends would have mocked.
The linchpin of those convictions, they will forthrightly tell you,
is the immortal soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' he says in his assertive way, ``if your conscience is
not the impress of the Holy Spirit, it's nothing more than an
opinion. And your opinion is no better than mine or the next
person's.''
</P>
<P>
   Even while he declared himself an atheist and professed
allegiance to Marx, something nagged at Genovese. ``I had long been
troubled by the lack of a moral foundation in Marxism,'' he says.
``It wasn't clear to me that you could have that foundation without
a belief in God. I mean, you can be an atheist and live a perfectly
moral life, but what is it grounded in?
</P>
<P>
   ``But disavowing Marxism and atheism _ that was an intellectual
decision. The question of faith is separate altogether. You can
decide to become a Christian, but you can't have faith if you don't
feel it. I didn't re-enter the church until I could feel myself in
grace. It didn't come at a particular moment; there was no road to
Damascus. It came slowly, and I think that would probably be
difficult for Protestants to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Many have pointed out the coincidence of his re-entering the
church only when the Soviet Union collapsed, and Genovese does not
deflect the suggestion that he needed an anchor. ``That may very
well be so,'' he says. ``I'm institutionally oriented, but I fail
to see what that has to do with the church and with faith. I know
former comrades who became Protestants, who became social
democrats, who became a lot of other things but not Roman
Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is a different man from the one old comrades on the left
once thought they knew, it's because he sees the relationship
between political philosophy and life differently. ``The horrors
(of Soviet communism),'' he wrote a few years ago, ``did not arise
from perversions of radical ideology but from the ideology itself.
We were led into complicity with mass murder and the desecration of
our professed ideals not by Stalinist or other corruptions of high
ideals, much less by unfortunate twists in some presumably
objective course of historical development, but by a deep flaw in
our understanding of human nature. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Confronting the basics
</P>
<P>
   Gene Genovese grew up in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn,
the son of a dockworker who didn't go to church and a mother who
prayed daily to St. Anthony. Betsey Fox grew up the culturally
privileged daughter of nonbelievers who instilled in her Calvinist
virtues of honesty and rectitude _ a precondition, she says, for
her eventual acceptance of faith.
</P>
<P>
   They were married on June 6, 1969. He was 39, and she was 28.
But the date that marks their lives today is Dec. 9, 1995. That was
the day Betsey Fox-Genovese received, in little more than an hour,
four sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church. She had recently been
baptized and now she was making her confession, receiving Communion
for the first time, being confirmed and _ after a quarter-century
of marriage in the eyes of the state _ being married to Gene
Genovese by a priest.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' she would write, ``that day wove together the
essential threads of the preceding 53 years of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   She had been a feminist who was wrestling with doubts. ``There's
nothing like contemporary feminism,'' she says, ``to bring you up
against the basics of human existence. I was writing a lot about
abortion and took it as a given, as someone who was pro-woman, that
it was a matter of rights. But the more I wrote, the more I had
trouble with the language in which the issue was always framed.
What I came to see was that the rights of women and the rights of
the fetus were not the issue. It was about the sanctity of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she came to that view, its ``full implications gradually
pulled me toward church membership and faith.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Sheila O'Connor-Ambrose was one of
Fox-Genovese's graduate students _ and the only Catholic, she says,
in the women's studies program. ``My faith was central to my
identity,'' O'Connor-Ambrose says. ``I was very open about it, both
intellectually and devotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   But the church, with its stand against abortion and its
injunction against premarital sex, was fair game, and not just for
feminists. The one open-minded listener O'Connor-Ambrose found was
Elizabeth Fox-Genovese. ``At the time she was agnostic, if not
atheist. But she made me feel comfortable. I remember her telling
me, `Sheila, if you can't be who you are, then what is the
point?'''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, Fox-Genovese resigned as director of Emory's
women's studies program _ her resignation forced, she believes,
because of a lawsuit accusing her of violating a subordinate's
civil rights. In her suit, Virginia Gould, a middle-aged woman who
had been one of Fox-Genovese's graduate students, contended that
she had been asked to perform duties that wouldn't have been asked
of a male subordinate and had been verbally abused. The lawsuit was
settled before it went to a jury.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor-Ambrose believes that experience was pivotal for both
of the Genoveses. ``Neither of them is even faintly postmodern,''
she says. ``They both believe there is a truth, that human nature
has meaning and that life has a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox-Genovese calls it an unfolding more than a conversion.
Sitting in their DeKalb County townhouse, she likens it to a
person's realizing finally who she is and what she is about. ``It's
when you know the outside and the inside have met,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Their joint journey began in 1968, when Genovese, twice
divorced, the subject of FBI dossiers and wiretaps, showed up at
Betsey Fox's door with two dozen red roses. She was a graduate
student at Harvard, and ``had never even heard of Eugene
Genovese,'' when a mutual friend arranged a blind date. It amuses
her now that she hadn't. He had not yet published his path-breaking
book ``Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made,'' but he had
done important scholarly work in the history of the antebellum
South. And if that were not reason enough, his notoriety as a
Marxist was.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how naive I was,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   From their kitchen table, papers spread before him, Gene
Genovese looks up from his work and replies, ``That's Harvard for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not be a welcome presence in the faculty lounge these
days _ and as far as he's concerned, that's just as well. He has
only contempt for the postmodernism, the secularism, the political
correctness he sees on college campuses. Back then, he was a
dissident merely by being from the left. Now anyone not on the left
is a dissident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned fast enough that he was a big deal,'' Betsey
Fox-Genovese says. ``He was unlike anyone I had ever met. He had
dated women more sophisticated than I was. He had great charm, he
was magnetic and, let's face it, he was a good-looking man.''
</P>
<P>
   Her own feminism was still taking shape, but she remembers his
bringing her back to her apartment that night. ``He kissed me on
the forehead and he left,'' she says. ``I remember shutting that
door and having this absolutely still feeling. I thought, `This is
the one.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, the historian Edward Whiting Fox, who was an atheist
but no Marxist, was taken aback at first. ``I was a guy who'd been
married twice and had the FBI after me,'' Genovese says. ``I mean,
I wasn't the best prospect around.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Betsey Fox had seen what she needed to see. ``I
couldn't have fallen in love with a man who didn't stand for
something, whose character I didn't respect. I knew he'd been
married before _ of course I knew that.'' She collects her thoughts
and says, ``But I let his past go.''
</P>
<P>
   After 30 years, Gene Genovese ``can't say we've had more than
half a dozen real fights. Temperamentally, we're very different
people _ you must have noticed that. I shoot from the hip; Betsey's
more measured in what she says. There've been times when maybe I've
wanted her to be bolder, to let the chips fall where they may. But
on the other hand, when we've worked together politically, Betsey's
saved me from very many tactical errors.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife describes their differences this way: ``He broods, he
talks to himself, he gets angry. I'm not a great brooder. I don't
often get angry. And when I do, my voice doesn't tend to rise. I
get icy.''

 &HT;    A Dallas minister's wish to help women has burgeoned into a
national mega-revival that changes lives and heals hurts
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It started when a small-town preacher played a hunch
and held a special Bible study that drew 40 curious women.
</P>
<P>
   It has mushroomed into a national revival that's expected to
draw tens of thousands of women to the Georgia Dome on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Woman Thou Art Loosed!'' revival, led by Bishop T.D.
Jakes, has become the theological equivalent of Microsoft stock _
the payoff gets bigger every year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the revival has filled stadiums and spawned a
best-selling book, a theatrical play, a special-edition Bible and a
CD.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few know that it was sparked by a whim, a spur-of-the-moment
decison to hold a Sunday school class just for women.
</P>
<P>
   The idea came in the early '90s, when Jakes was pastor of a
church in Charleston, W.Va. He discovered during counseling
sessions that women in his church were grappling with similar
problems. The Sunday school class idea seemed to be a good way to
address common issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called it a form of mass counseling,'' said Jakes, 42. ``I
thought they could benefit from being exposed to one another.''
</P>
<P>
   About 40 women attended the first study. Attendance doubled the
following week. Intrigued, Jakes held a third class the following
week. He was shocked at what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked around the church and it was filled with women
standing outside,'' Jakes said. ``I didn't even have a name for
it.'' He does now.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes went to the 13th chapter of Luke and found the story where
Jesus heals an enfeebled woman by declaring, ``Woman, thou art
loosed from thine infirmity.'' Thus was born the ``Woman Thou Art
Loosed!'' revival.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes' fame within the black community has grown along with the
success of the revival. He is the senior pastor of the Potter's
House in Dallas, a nondenominational mega-church with 18,000
members, including celebrities such as NFL star Deion Sanders. He
lectures regularly and leads revivals across the country, has
written 14 books and is known around the world through his
television show, ``Get Ready.'' He and his wife, Serita, have five
children.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many African-American women claim that the revivals have
delivered them from the same problems Jakes uncovered during
counseling sessions with members of his church _ low self-esteem,
bad relationships, sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lifted the scales off of my eyes,'' said Mettye Mero, 76,
of Stone Mountain (Ga.), who heard Jakes preach at the Georgia Dome
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Like those first special Sunday school classes, the revivals
still feel like a form of mass counseling. It's not uncommon to see
women _ some traveling from as far away as Asia and Europe _ cry,
dance, collapse and hug total strangers. Jakes is widely considered
a master preacher, someone who blends therapy and theology with a
dramatic delivery. But his greatest gift may be his vulnerability,
his willingness to preach about his insecurities over his
appearance _ he recently lost 100 pounds _ and the devastating
childhood loss of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're looking for Superman,'' Jakes said during
a phone interview from his Dallas church. ``We're looking for Clark
Kent, just down-to-earth people, people who've had their scrapes
and scars but can say, 'I'm only here by the grace of God.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such a message helped Wanda Kelley, 39, of Atlanta recover from
the end of a painful relationship. Kelley, a nurse, was walking
through a grocery store when she spotted a book written by Jakes.
After reading only a few pages, she left the supermarket in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to my car and sat down, I couldn't even leave the
parking lot, `` Kelley said. ``I read a fourth of the book in the
parking lot. I couldn't move.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakes has also become popular and respected for his willingness
to let women take part in his church and revivals.
</P>
<P>
   While some churches still do not allow women to preach, Jakes
invites women pastors to preach alongside him at his revivals and
constantly tells women that they are ``survivors'' and a
``beautiful piece of artwork.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He treats us like we're queens,'' said Pam Tarvin, 34, an
Atlanta minister who left her church after learning women couldn't
preach there. ``We can be heard (at Jakes' revivals). That helps a
lot, to know that we're important, just like the men.''
</P>
<P>
   By reaching women, Jakes has awakened the group that fills most
churches in the black community on a regular basis. That's why he
gets such large crowds at his revivals, said Teresa Fry-Brown, an
ordained minister and teacher of preaching at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you consider the makeup of the churches, the preponderance
of people in the church are usually women, though the leadership is
decidedly male,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't see any of that changing any time soon, even with
the success of Jakes' revivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been at this thing for 18 years, and it's slow going,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes, however, said his success has at least shown other
preachers that they can talk about personal pain in the pulpit.
``I'm not standing alone,'' he said. ``I just gave people the
permission to talk about something people always wanted to talk
about.''

 &HT;    27 bands rise to the occasion for Martha White anniversary
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 1.
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to say which is tastier: Martha White biscuits or the
bluegrass jingle advertising Martha White self-rising flour with
``Hot Rize.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs performed the ditty for years on
the Grand Ole Opry, Earl's banjo racing as Lester praised ``the
finest biscuits ever was.'' When Garrison Keillor made his first
pilgrimage to Nashville and heard them at the Opry, he was so
inspired that he invented a fictitious sponsor _ Powdermilk
Biscuits _ for his own radio show, ``A Prairie Home Companion.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, to mark its 100th anniversary, Martha White Foods
has dusted off the old tune and made it the centerpiece of the
celebration. The company invited bluegrass bands to submit tapes of
themselves playing the jingle; the winner would get to perform it
on the Opry, where Martha White has sponsored a segment since 1948.
A new Martha White cookbook, ``Southern Traditions,'' is due out
this month as well.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Betty Crocker or Aunt Jemima, Martha White Lindsey was a
real person. Her father, who owned Nashville's Royal Mill, named
his best flour for his 3-year-old daughter and put her darling face
on the package. It's still there, in heirloom black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Martha married an orthodontist, moved to Memphis and died in
1949. But she lived long enough to see her father's mill sold and
the new owner rename the company for its best-known product. Today
it's part of the Pillsbury empire, though the offices remain in
Nashville and the flour and cornmeal are milled in Jackson, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Martha White jingle has been sung by
everyone from Porter Wagoner to Marty Stuart to Allison Krause. One
band even named itself Hot Rize, Martha White's trademarked name
for leavening.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven bands from as far away as Switzerland entered the
100th-birthday contest. The winner, a Virginia ensemble called Big
Country Bluegrass, performed the song on the Opry in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the longest version we've ever heard,'' says company
spokeswoman Linda Carman.
</P>
<P>
   But that's OK. To fans of biscuits and bluegrass, the Martha
White theme is downright classical. Or, as Keillor once put it,
it's ``the Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer of bluegrass
jingles.''

   ATLANTA: I get icy.''
</P>
<P>
   From communism
</P>
<P>
   to Communion
</P>
<P>
   It's midday on a Friday, and Genovese has returned from Happy
Herman's on Cheshire Bridge Road with a split-loaf deli sandwich
and two bottles of wine. He likes good Chiantis, but an Argentine
red has struck his curiosity. He opens it for lunch and, without
making a show of it, says grace before his guest has joined him at
the table. ``Look,'' he says moments later, ``the critical question
is whether you believe in the immortal soul. I accept the promise
of faith _ as a mystery to be unraveled in due time.''
</P>
<P>
   You can find old Marxists anywhere, their all-encompassing views
of history rusted and lying about like old Camaros on cinder
blocks. It's harder to catch one taking Communion. ``The question
of atheism,'' Genovese says, ``was a philosophical one. The rest _
the acceptance of the church, receiving Communion and so forth _
was a matter of grace. It becomes a question of faith, of whether
you can feel the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife's journey, he thinks, had fewer obstacles. She had been
a nonbeliever, but her father's background was Calvinist and she
had always had an intellectual interest in religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she might become a Presbyterian,'' he says. ``When
she said Catholic, I gulped. I was surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was his own change of heart that surprised people. Their
friend John Shelton Reed, a writer and sociologist at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, had known for 15 years
that Genovese's Marxism was coming loose from its moorings. But he
hadn't expected him to be kneeling in a pew. ``I guess he got tired
of waiting out in the car while Betsey was in church,'' Reed says.
</P>
<P>
   There was more gallantry in it than that. Once Betsey began
going to Mass, Gene _ still calling himself an atheist _ went ``in
the belief that a man should go with his wife to church.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a year he was asking Father Richard Lopez, the priest who
had given his wife instruction in the faith, to hear his
confession. He had been away for 50 years, but not in the eyes of
the church. ``It was not an inordinately long confession,''
Genovese says. ``Think about that for a minute. That first
confession after 50 years was a piece of cake. It's the next one
you have to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   He has heard what his critics think _ that in trading Marxism
for Catholicism, he merely traded one system of absolutes for
another. John Womack, a historian at Harvard University and himself
a Marxist and one-time Catholic, is at a loss to explain it but
speculates that on one level it's perhaps an evolution of ideas
Genovese has had for many years. ``One of the things he was
interested in 20 years ago,'' Womack says, ``was Euro-communism and
the role of the Catholic Church. There is a particular strain of
Catholicism that gets revived from time to time that's very
egalitarian and in many ways sympathetic to Marxism. I don't know,
it may just be that these ideas just kept working in his head.''
</P>
<P>
   But Genovese has gone from categorical atheism to the Baltimore
catechism, and Womack grants the implied point. ``Anyone who'd
known Gene over the years probably thought, `Good God, this is one
more strange thing he's done.'''
</P>
<P>
   An explanation often heard is that once the Soviet Union
collapsed, Genovese needed a spiritual anchor as much as a
political faith. Even Sheila O'Connor-Ambrose, no Marxist, says,
``I think they're both comfortable with authority and
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   But none of their friends sees it as trading one faith for
another. O'Connor-Ambrose's husband, Douglas, who teaches history
at Hamilton College in Utica, N.Y., underwent a journey of his own,
from Catholicism to Marxism and back. He says of the experience:
``What's involved in that shift is so fundamental. It involves an
entirely different understanding of the meaning of life. With
Marxism, you had the idea that you could determine the processes of
history, that you could know how it would end. But faith accepts
the limitations of human reason. It accepts the existence of
mystery in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those mysteries is the Trinity, the Christian idea of God,
Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit as one. Even when he was still an
atheist, only five years ago, Genovese was writing:
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot understand how Christians, without ceasing to be
Christians, can retreat one inch from a belief that Jesus is the
second person of a triune God, the Christ, the Redeemer. If other
religions offer equally valid ways to salvation and if Christianity
itself may be understood solely as a code of morals and ethics,
then we may as well all become Buddhists or, better, atheists. I
intend no offense, but it takes one to know one.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he was rising from his knees with hundreds of
others at the Cathedral of Christ the King, making the sign of the
cross and accepting the blessing of Father Ronald Higgins. ``Go in
peace,'' Higgins bade them.
</P>
<P>
   Mass had ended, and the organist began playing ``America the
Beautiful.'' For a moment, at least, the wall between church and
state was lowered, and all sang as one as they filed out on a
Saturday evening, their voices filling the huge cathedral. Turning
from his pew into the aisle, Gene Genovese sang as he prayed,
devoutly as only a true believer can.

   That's the welcome offered to thousands of people who tune in to
Bishop T.D. Jakes' cable television show. But it could also serve
as a rallying cry for the charismatic evangelist as he makes
himself at home in Atlanta this week.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving here Monday night for his fourth annual ``Woman,
Thou Art Loosed!'' conference, Jakes has been treated like a hero.
Homeless women cried in his arms. Children hugged him. And
dignitaries such as Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes made time to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   But Jakes' most enthusiastic fans were the thousands of women
who filled the Georgia Dome Thursday and Friday night to hear him
preach. Many were expected to return to the dome at 11 a.m. today
for the close of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes, 42, the senior pastor of the Potter's House in Dallas, a
nondenominational megachurch with 18,000 members, began the
three-day event Thursday with a message of hope, despite the tragic
events that were playing out only a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not matter what you go through,'' Jakes told the
Georgia Dome crowd, just a few hours after a man shot and killed
nine people in Atlanta before taking his own life outside a gas
station in Acworth (Ga.). ``It matters how you go through it.
Trouble doesn't have to stop for you to have victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebounding from tragedy is one of Jakes' favorite themes. The
conference, which began in the early '90s as a Sunday school
lesson, attempts to show women how they can transcend the mistakes
of their past through Jesus. Jakes delivers that message through a
blend of music, therapeutic advice and foot-stomping preaching.
</P>
<P>
   It's a message with broad appeal, attracting tens of thousands
of women _ black, white and Latino _ to the dome Thursday and
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to get women like this unless our needs are
being met,'' said Sheila Dalton of St. Louis. ``You don't come from
around the country to hear good cheerleading. You come for
healing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakes knows how to offer such healing. He also knows how to play
to a crowd. Even though he warned the thousands of women packed
into the dome Thursday that he wasn't there to perform, he couldn't
help himself in the end.
</P>
<P>
   As he hurtled to the climax of his sermon, Jakes raised his arms
and did a jitterbug-like dance.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers fell like confetti as he twirled to a stop on the massive
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes stayed busy earlier in the week, holding news conferences,
meeting with fans and offering prayers for those in need.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he attended the premier of his play, ``Woman, Thou
Art Loosed,'' at the Atlanta Civic Center, where he met with a
handful of women from area homeless shelters. They were part of a
larger group Jakes had bused in to see the performance.
</P>
<P>
   One of his guests, LaToya Procter, 28, dabbed her eyes as she
shared her struggles with the pastor. She's been looking for work
while living in a shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no income, nothing coming in,'' she told Jakes. ``But I
pray to God every day before I leave that he will provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakes offered comfort, draping an arm around her shoulder. ``God
is a God of second chances,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes' wife, Serita, provided one of the week's most touching
moments when she was asked why her husband appeals so much to
women.
</P>
<P>
   After a moment of reflection, she recalled once sharing her
fears with her husband that she might not be able to handle the
public glare of being his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes talked to her as a minister, she said, reminding her of
God's strength. She said she felt as if she had stumbled into a
fairy tale when she married.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes looked at his wife and smiled. He rubbed her shoulders as
she blushed. But Serita Jakes had one more thing to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was my husband's first 'Woman, Thou Art Loosed'
conference,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For once, Jakes was speechless.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the high temperature at Havre, Mont., was 105
degrees. On Saturday, the mercury will struggle to reach the low
70s as a cooler Canadian air mass continues to build east-southeast
across the upper Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of thunderstorms will erupt across the Great Lakes
region along the leading edge of the Canadian air mass as very
humid air, which has stifled the region this week, is lifted by a
cool front. A few of the storms could become severe, with damaging
winds and large hail posing a threat in spots. Heavy rain is also
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of heavy thunderstorms will heighten over parts of
Kansas, western Oklahoma and northwest Texas as a disturbance
associated with the monsoon pattern over Arizona and New Mexico
approaches the southern Plains and interacts with a front and humid
air from the Gulf of Mexico. The risk will be particularly high
Saturday night, when there will be a surge of moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico. Heavy rains are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Torrid heat and stifling humidity will continue to grip a large
region bounded by the Gulf Coast, Southeast and Middle Atlantic
states while intensifying in New York state and parts of southern
and western New England. Isolated thunderstorms will bring spotty,
temporary relief to a few places. Spotty storms will develop mainly
near Florida's Atlantic Coast and the Gulf Coast from northeast
Texas to Florida as the leading edge of the sea breeze moves inland
and lifts hot, humid air. A few storms will also speckle the
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Sultry Chicago
</P>
<P>
   Record humidity stifled Chicago early Friday as the dew point
was stuck at 82 degrees for five hours. By definition, the dew
point is the threshold to which the air temperature must be lowered
to bring invisible water vapor to the brink of condensation. When
the dew point is 82 degrees, not much cooling is needed for
condensation, a sign of an extremely large amount of water vapor in
the air. As sultry dew points rise above 70 degrees, the rate of
evaporation of sweat from human skin is increasingly reduced,
thereby limiting the body's ability to cool itself. The air feels
stifling.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As if New York's bars and clubs didn't have enough
singles rubbing elbows and noses, some of them are taking
mating-mixology to the next level: mixer bashes disguised as theme
nights.
</P>
<P>
   Forget fern bars and zinfandel. Trendy night spots have been
giving singles parties a hipster makeover, with all the giggly
savvy of a generation weaned on too many episodes of ``The Dating
Game'' and MTV's bawdy update, ``Singled Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown weekly events like ``Punk Rock Karaoke,'' held at
Arlene's Grocery, and the Hula Hoop competition at the Tortilla
Flats restaurant have a decidedly kitschy edge. They are a backlash
against chichi clubs, where locating your soul mate _ providing you
can make it past the velvet ropes _ can be as unnerving as a job
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if you're a fat old man or a model, it's
still hard to meet people in the city,'' said Trang Choung, 26, a
research editor at Marie Claire magazine, who gives campy Monday
night parties at the downtown club Veruka. ``We offer games and
alcohol to get the crowd past those first awkward stages, and then
they're left to their own devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the offerings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MOTHRA (Monday nights at B Bar; 358 Bowery, at Fourth Street; $5
cover)
</P>
<P>
   At Mothra, the weekly social named after the radioactive insect
that battled Godzilla, Audrey Bernstein has been the hostess of ice
breakers like a retro ski party and an India-themed dress-up party.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, a contest sponsored by Playboy magazine was held
with prizes bestowed in the categories of ``hairiest chest,''
``shortest shorts'' and ``naughtiest nightgown.'' The actors
Laurence Fishburne and Tony Danza and 1964's Playmate of the Year
all came out for the spectacle, which featured a king-size bed
covered with red velvet, set up in the garden for photos by
Mothra's photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't find a date,'' lamented Jane Pratt, the editor in
chief of Jane magazine, who wore a low-cut dress and silver high
heels. ``But the cool part was you could pretend you were making
fun of everything but in reality you got to lie in a huge bed with
a cute guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Overheard pickup line: ``Will you pose for me?''
</P>
<P>
   Turn-ons: Possibility of meeting Gene Simmons of Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Turnoffs: Possibility of going home with Gene Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtrack: Remixed retro classics like Madonna's 1980's hit
``Burning Up,'' played at low speed, and a dance hall version of
Barry Manilow's ``Copacabana.''
</P>
<P>
   Dress code: Retro sexy. For women, Daryl K hip-huggers and
slinky disco gold halter tops. For men, cheap Guayabera shirts and
$400 Gucci khakis, Ray-Ban aviator shades, sideburns optional.
</P>
<P>
   VERUKA (Monday nights; 525 Broome Street, at Thompson Street; no
cover)
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have trouble meeting girls anyway,'' sniffed Tim
Durant, 25, a model with a Hamptons' tan, nursing a martini at a
recent singles party at Veruka.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Durant volunteered for the makeshift ``Dating
Game,'' where he was asked questions like: ``If you were an animal,
what would your mating call be?'' Trang Chuong and Kathy
Szwedzinski have been throwing these love-connection fetes with a
'70s nostalgia feel for the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Past events have included Twister floor games, a
bachelor/bachelorette party with kissing games like spin the bottle
and truth or dare, and a matchmaking exercise where revelers wear
numbered tags and check a bulletin board to see if any secret
admirers have left a message.
</P>
<P>
   Overheard pickup line: Too loud to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Turn-ons: Might get to kiss a model.
</P>
<P>
   Turnoffs: He/she might be wearing braces.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtrack: Bittersweet make-out anthems like Human League's
``Don't You Want Me?'' and Elvis' ``Crazy Little Thing Called
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Dress code: Fashionably cute. For women, the models' favorite,
Earl Jeans (size 26 waist), and a DKNY tube top. For men, anything
by Helmut Lang, bright Nike sandals.
</P>
<P>
   LUVBUZZ (1438 Third Avenue, at 82d Street; no cover)
</P>
<P>
   This new Upper East Side bar promises ``the end of the frat boy
singles bar scene,'' but so far it attracts many more women than
men. Maybe the guys aren't that comfortable amid the suggestive
decor _ heart-colored love seats, Latex curtains and honeycomb
motifs _ surrounding the computer monitors and digital cameras that
are part of the bar's elaborate ``Date-a-Base'' system.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons are encouraged to fill out a Luvsurvey, which asks for
personal information like the celebrity you are most often compared
with. Your image is then fed into a computer, and a ``Luvhandle''
is assigned to you. If a match is made on line, either between
patrons across the room or those using the Web site from home, the
staff, or Luvbuzz bees, will arrange a date at Luvbuzz.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people were sitting home behind their computers and
having online chats instead of face-to-face dating,'' said Cathy
Cervenka, the director for digital media and dating systems at
Luvbuzz, during a recent round of ``boozy bingo,'' one of the
quirky theme parties, held on Monday evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Overheard pickup line: ``I bet you own an iMac.''
</P>
<P>
   Turn-ons: Men manly enough to be seen slurping Buzz Cones, like
Sno-Kones with alcohol, through licorice whips.
</P>
<P>
   Turnoffs: Lovelorn singles with carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtrack: Sentimental favorites from Sarah McLachlan to Dean
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Dress code: Office casual. For women, Prada nylon backpacks and
Calvin Klein solid-colored slimming separates. For men, Calvin
Klein's CK One cologne, loosened ties.
</P>
<P>
   TORTILLA FLATS (Wednesday night Hula Hoop competition; 767
Washington Street, at 12th Street; no cover)
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been this much excitement since Siegfried met
Roy!'' said Steve Pagnotta, the pajama-clad emcee at the Hula Hoop
competition held at this Greenwich Village restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Here, under the dusty Christmas lights, secretaries, magazine
editors and stockbrokers gather with meat-packing district locals,
and attempt to twirl the hoop for a full three minutes without
knocking into platters of refried beans. (The winner gets
short-lived fame and a free pitcher of margaritas.)
</P>
<P>
   The scene on a recent Wednesday: a guy resembling Fabio with an
open-to-the-waist silk shirt gyrated a pink hoop to the Weather
Girls' hit ``It's Raining Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Overheard pickup line: ``Hey, baby, uh ...'' (too drunk to
complete the thought).
</P>
<P>
   Turn-ons: Hula Hoopers are surprisingly approachable.
</P>
<P>
   Turnoffs: Hula Hoopers too drunk to remember your name five
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtrack: Led Zeppelin's ``When the Levee Breaks'' and ``Ring
My Bell'' by Anita Ward, blared to distortion.
</P>
<P>
   Dress code: Business dishabille. For women, office gear modified
for Hula Hooping, i.e. buttoned shirts tied in a French knot above
the navel, heels removed for lower center of gravity. For men, a
Brooks Brothers suit with the jacket dangling in spilt sour mix.
</P>
<P>
   PUNK ROCK KARAOKE (Monday nights at Arlene's Grocery; 95 Stanton
Street; no cover)
</P>
<P>
   When VH-1 recently taped a pilot show called ``Celebrity
Karaoke,'' based on the longstanding sing-along night at the Elbow
Room, a club in Greenwich Village, there were bound to be some
grumblings from the underground. The truly alternative Punk Rock
Karaoke, held at Arlene's Grocery, has become the place to be seen
and to make the scene for nostalgic punks and the grungy East
Village set.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the lo-fi nature of the genre, there's a grumpy
emcee with an English accent who insults would-be participants, and
a live band that accompanies the amateurs, who read songs off
homemade lyric sheets instead of monitors. Although Punk Rock
Karaoke is not specifically billed as a singles party, people do
turn out to mosh and mingle.
</P>
<P>
   For punk aficionados nothing seems to be sexier than seeing a
member of the opposite sex belt out ``God Save the Queen'' by the
Sex Pistols, said Trisha Mulcahy, the bleached-blond lead singer of
a band named Superlux. At a recent Monday night party, she wore
silver sequined pants and a white T-shirt that she ripped freshly
for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time I tried very hard to look cool,'' Ms. Mulcahy
said, after a well-received version of the Clash hit ``I Fought the
Law.'' ``But then it got boring. Now, I find it much sexier to
snarl and scream at the top of your lungs.''
</P>
<P>
   Overheard pickup line: ``I bet you'd look fantastic singing Iggy
Pop's ``I Wanna Be Your Dog!''
</P>
<P>
   Turn-ons: Visualize yourself as the star of VH-1's ``Where Are
They Now?''
</P>
<P>
   Turnoffs: Good chance of sustaining irreversible hearing loss.
Creepy guys from failed punk rock bands trying to get a free beer.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtrack: Full catalog of songs from the Stooges and the
Misfits.
</P>
<P>
   Dress code: Clashing loudly. For women, either too much eyeliner
and ripped fishnets or the clean sexy look of the sitcom
``Friends.'' For men, combat boots, despite the heat, and torn
concert T-shirts.
</P>

THE TWO SIDES OF FLAP OVER SAIPAN LABOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Carmencita ``Chie'' Abad was an accounting clerk in
the Philippines when she paid a recruiter $2,000 so she could work
in a garment factory in Saipan, a U.S. territory in the Northern
Mariana Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Abad said she anticipated it would be a good job _ after all,
it's the United States _ but instead she said she toiled 84 to 100
hours a week for $2.15 an hour in a dust-filled factory that makes
clothes for the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese workers there have it worse, Abad said. They're
forced to live in barracks with no running water and no air
conditioning in a climate that's hotter than Houston's. Many also
have to take a loan to pay the recruiter's fee of $5,000 to $7,000,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Saipan is a U.S. territory, the minimum wage is
$3.05 an hour instead of the $5.15 on the mainland. When Saipan was
made a U.S. territory in 1976, the United States agreed that the
island could set its own minimum wage and its own immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   Abad is in Houston for the next two weeks to put pressure on
U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, to stop blocking, as Abad put it, a
bill that would extend the $5.15 minimum wage to Saipan. The bill
also would require the island to adhere to U.S. immigration laws
and require factories in the Northern Mariana Islands to abide by
U.S. labor laws. Otherwise, they would be unable to continue using
the label ``Made in the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., who introduced the
legislation, has been told by the Republican House leadership the
bill won't go forward, said Miller's spokesman, Daniel Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DeLAY SAYS FACTORIES OK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill doesn't have much support, so DeLay isn't holding up
anything, said Tony Rudy, DeLay's deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy said DeLay opposes the bill because bureaucrats 12,000
miles away in Washington shouldn't be trampling on the sovereignty
of the islands, which have the right to set their own minimum wage
and immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the factories aren't bad, he said. DeLay traveled to
Saipan last year. He said he found them better than garment
factories in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy speculated that the factories will move to mainland China
and Bangladesh if the minimum wage is increased to $5.15.
</P>
<P>
   It's truly remarkable how partisan this has become, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The left sees it as capitalism run amuck, and the right sees
it as a free market that works,'' Rudy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariana Islands became a U.S. territory primarily for trade
reasons. Companies don't have to pay import tariffs on products
made there, said Bob Buzzanco, a University of Houston assistant
professor who specializes in global history. They can get away with
a lot of things, such as skirting U.S. labor laws, that they can't
get away with on the mainland, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garment workers in Saipan have filed a class action in Los
Angeles against 18 major retailers and 11 contractors for what San
Diego lawyer Patrick Daniels said is indentured servitude of the
guest workers. The Gap is one of the retailers that has been sued.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CHINESE GET MONEY, FAITH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gap spokesman Alan Marks said many of the allegations Abad made
are in the lawsuit, and thus he can't comment on them. But he
pointed to the Gap's code of vendor conduct, which prohibits its
contractors from using forced labor, paying less than the local
minimum wage or requiring employees to work more than 60 hours a
week on a regular basis. In addition, factories must be
well-ventilated and employees must get one day off a week.
</P>
<P>
   Gap employees also monitor the factories, Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Lou Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values
Coalition, a Christian lobbying group on Capitol Hill, said he has
visited Saipan twice and found the factories and dorms clean and
safe.
</P>
<P>
   In three to four years _ even after paying recruiting fees _ the
workers can earn more in Saipan than they can in their entire lives
in China, Sheldon said. They take the money back to China and live
comfortable lives.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon, who represents 43,000 churches, said he is opposed to
the Miller bill because the churches have a vested interest in
keeping the factories humming. The influx of factory workers opens
up a great opportunity to preach to people whose countries, such as
China, have made it next to impossible for evangelists to preach,
he said. So the workers go back to China with money and full of
faith.

TAIWAN'S CHINA ENVOY REAFFIRMS SEPARATE-AND-EQUAL STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Taiwan's special envoy to China delivered a
long-awaited statement Friday on Taiwan-China relations, saying
that President Lee Teng-hui's call for ``special state-to-state''
ties with Beijing did not rule out eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the envoy, Koo Chen-fu, endorsed Taiwan's new position that
it will continue talks with China only under the guise of a meeting
of two equal and separate states, a position that has infuriated
leaders in Beijing, who see that as a move away from, and not
toward, reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Koo's statement appeared to scotch any chance that Beijing would
go ahead with a visit to Taiwan by China's top Taiwan negotiator,
Wang Daohan, who would have been the most senior Chinese official
to visit Taiwan if he were to go, as originally scheduled, in
October.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, Chinese officials immediately denounced Koo's
statement as a clear violation of a 1992 agreement between China
and Taiwan to conduct negotiations on the basis that both sides
recognized the principle of a single Chinese nation, or ``one
China,'' with the goal of negotiations being eventual
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing did not formally cancel Wang's visit, at least not yet.
But its declaration that the basis of all contacts, exchanges and
dialogue now ceased to exist points to a serious deterioration in
China-Taiwan relations.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Taiwan was swept with rumors that China was
launching a missile attack overnight, because the entire island
succumbed to a blackout that began late Thursday, the worst
electricity shortage in decades. Power was restored in Taipei
before dawn on Friday, and the authorities reassured countless
worried callers that the blackout had nothing to do with politics
or war.
</P>
<P>
   Although the chances of military conflict between China and
Taiwan now appear to be small, Washington has said a breakdown in
talks is dangerous for security in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said it is critical to keep China-Taiwan
negotiations moving forward to keep the potential for military
conflict at bay. Over the last year, Washington has increasingly
pressured Taiwan to agree to more substantive talks, and some
analysts said they believed that a reason that Lee changed his
stance was to block additional talks, which he judged to be
detrimental to the Taiwan side.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Koo repeated Taiwan's mixed message of a desire for
greater separation from China at the same time that he pledged a
commitment to eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
   ``The existing policy toward unification has not changed,'' Koo
told a news briefing Friday afternoon in Taipei. ``What we see as
`one China' is something for the future, since China at present is
divided and ruled separately by two equal sovereign states in
existence at the same time, hence a special state-to-state
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Koo urged his Chinese counterpart to still consider going to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, I would like to take the opportunity to extend my most
sincere welcome to Wang, because communication is more urgently
needed especially when there are differences,'' said Koo, who is
chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Wading into the semantical jungle that has confused the new
position since Lee announced it on July 9, Koo argued that it was
not technically correct to refer to the stand as a ``two state
theory,'' the phrase favored by the Taiwan media to describe his
demand that Beijing accord equal status to Taipei in talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``To oversimplify President Lee's statement as a two-state
theory is a distortion that can easily cause misunderstanding,''
Koo said. ``We want to pursue future unification of China based on
equality in negotiations.''

FROM BOTS TO ZEN IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
 (Weekly Digital L.A. column)  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I see a lot of books these days related to
technology and entertainment, some of which I'd suggest you check
out. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ One useful reference, though doomed to be outdated almost
immediately, is ``BotGuide,'' by Michael Wolff and Peter Rutten
(258 pages, Harper San Francisco; $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   The creators of the ``NetGuide'' series now have dived into the
brave new world of bots, little software programs that go out on
the Internet and do things for you. The guide reviews hundreds of
bots, from all kinds of Web sites and for all kinds of purposes,
and tells you how to use them to simplify your life on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Fat Tire, A Celebration of the Mountain Bike'' (141 pages,
Chronicle Books; $24.95) is a fun, funky look at one very high-tech
corner of our leisure world, the mountain bike.
</P>
<P>
   From the tire tread glued to the cover to the examinations of
such biking subcultures as soul riders and bike messengers, it
covers almost as much ground as an extreme racer. There are
sections on the history and anatomy of bikes, interviews with world
champions, dissections of great mountain biking destinations and
lots of great photos.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Zen Computer: Mindfulness and the Machine'' by Philip Toshio
Sudo (209 pages, Simon &AMP; Schuster; $22) is a delightful little book
about finding harmony with your computer. Sudo, a musician and
martial artist from Hawaii, squeezes his advice into near
epigrammatic prose, finding soul in the new machine.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonderful antidote to the craziness of a world sliced
into milliseconds, urging a calmness and peace that can even be
found in what we may think is the exact opposite of Zen, a
computer. Even with technology, Sudo argues, we can learn how one
 &UR; !ital! &LR; can &UR; !off! &LR;  equal zero.
</P>
<P>
   GIVE 'EM THE CHAIR: One of the coolest gaming, or any other
entertainment, accessories that I've come across in recent times is
the Intensor chair, from a company that was called BSG but recently
changed its name to Imeron and moved to Cary, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In the Intensor's LX configuration, it looks something like a
normal office chair, except for the 9-foot cable connecting it to a
foot-square amplifier.
</P>
<P>
   Plug the $179 LX in, connect it to your favorite gaming console,
PC, stereo or home theater system, and you're about to get
physically immersed in sound.
</P>
<P>
   The chair has a huge speaker located between your legs and two
others on the outside of your thighs. Another speaker is hidden
under the slim cushion of the back and two more speakers are higher
on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Two tiny slider controls on the side change the volume and
``rumble'' effect. The result is remarkable, punching a game's
sound through your gut with every rev of a race car engine or
report of a gun.
</P>
<P>
   I do have to say the chair isn't perfect, however. The volume
slider control on the chair I tested had come off during shipment
and required a slight amount of ingenuity to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   And the company offers a ``free'' extra cushion for the chair
(you have to send in $3.50 to cover shipping). Given the
vibrational pounding you'll take from a couple of hours of Quake II
or Gran Turismo in the chair, or the wear and tear of watching a
couple of movies in it, you should get the cushion. But it just
seems silly that the company makes people send away for it.
</P>
<P>
   BSG/Imeron also offers the chair in a much cheaper FX
configuration, basically without the office chair base. Instead, it
folds like a clamshell, with a sturdy handle at the hinge so you
can more easily move around the 19-pound seat. Overall, I'd give
the product a very strong A-minus.
</P>
<P>
   STAYING ALIVE: One of the more remarkable side projects that
Steven Spielberg has been involved in since creating the
much-lauded ``Schindler's List'' in 1993 is his Survivors of the
Shoah Visual History Foundation, which has videotaped the stories
of more than 50,000 survivors of Nazi Germany's attempts to
exterminate Jews and others during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Now the foundation has released a CD-ROM called Survivors:
Testimonies of the Holocaust through Knowledge Adventure and Simon
&AMP; Schuster Interactive. It is hosted by Winona Ryder and Leonardo
DiCaprio and features the videotaped stories of four of the people
taped in the Survivors project.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't light viewing, and in fact the disc is rated for
teens and above. Along with the 80 minutes of videotaped stories,
it includes a link to a Web site, a timeline, a map that follows
the trail of the four speakers, a searchable glossary and more. It
will run on either a Power Macintosh or Windows 95 or 98 system.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors say never forget, and Spielberg certainly is trying to
make sure that doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND: You won't find the latest Civil War
simulation from the great Sid Meier on store shelves anywhere.
Instead, Antietam! _ based on the game system in Meier's
much-lauded Gettysburg! _ will be available this fall through the
Web site ( &UR; !bold! &LR; www.firaxis.com &UR; !off! &LR; ) of Meier's company,
Firaxis Games.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first title in Meier's Great Battles series of games.
Meier is promising several new kinds of troops (they even have
red-pantalooned Zouaves), better terrain and artificial opponents,
and a variety of kinds of engagements, from small skirmishes to the
entire battle, one of the bloodiest and most critical of the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE CALENDAR: Among the significant events coming up in the
next several days:
</P>
<P>
   _ Herring on Hollywood. The Internet business magazine Red
Herring comes to the Century Plaza Hotel in Century City from
Sunday to Tuesday to ponder entertainment and technology. Pricey
gathering, but lots of well-placed decision-makers on both sides of
that chasm, if last year's confab in Newport Beach is any guide. Go
to Red Herring's Web site at
 &UR; !bold! &LR; www.herring.com/events/home.html &UR; !off! &LR;  for more
information.
</P>
<P>
   _ The American Film Institute in Los Feliz holds its monthly
salon on entertainment technology on Thursday, focusing this month
on creature effects. The seminars, usually held at 7:30 p.m. on the
first Thursday of the month, are routinely engaging, with a pretty
remarkable array of speakers. Go to  &UR; !bold! &LR; www.afi.org &UR; !off! &LR;  for
more information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Venice Interactive Community, or VIC, will sponsor a seminar
on online interactive learning systems, featuring three companies
that specialize in distance learning software. The event includes
the usual VIC socializing and networking beforehand, tables with
information about event sponsors, plus the presentations from 7 to
10 p.m. Tuesday at the Skirball Cultural Center, 2701 N. Sepulveda
Blvd., Los Angeles, at the top of the Sepulveda Pass.

CHINA'S CRACKDOWN ON FALUN GONG MOVEMENT INTENSIFIES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The Chinese authorities disclosed on Friday that a
retired senior army officer, who is also a member of the spiritual
movement that was banned last week, has confessed his ``mistakes''
and renounced his allegiance to the movement.
</P>
<P>
   The admission by the retired officer, Li Qihua, is a milestone
in China's crackdown on Falun Gong, the nation's most sweeping
political campaign in a decade, and is a sign that despite
widespread resistance by many members, the authorities appear to be
succeeding in dismantling the central part of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Li carried the rank of lieutenant general in the People's
Liberation Army, in which he served most of his life. But his
important posting was as head of the 301 Hospital in Beijing, an
extremely sensitive post because the enormous military-run hospital
is where China's top leaders are treated.
</P>
<P>
   Li, 81, retired 15 years ago after a lifetime in the communist
cause that he said began at age 10. His seniority, impeccable
credentials and continued access to the highest circle of China's
leaders made him strategically important to Falun Gong, and equally
threatening to China's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the military newspaper, People's Liberation Daily,
printed a question-and-answer interview with Li, who offered a
classic Communist Party-style confession of his wrongdoing as he
endorsed the party's crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was cheated,'' Li said, according to the account.
``The party's decision is very wise, very correct, and very
prompt.''
</P>
<P>
   In the secretive and shadow-prone nature of Chinese politics,
however, Li's former position and rank were not described in the
article, which simply referred to him as an old cadre who had
``wrongly written an article propagating Falun Gong.''
</P>
<P>
   To the casual reader, Li's long admission might look like just
another item in the anti-Falun Gong propaganda that has swamped
China's official media since the movement was formally banned last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But as Chinese insiders know, Li has been identified by Chinese
authorities as Falun Gong's top officer in Beijing, and the article
in question was a critical item in the government's decision to
mount such a wide-reaching political campaign against the movement.
Falun Gong advocates an amalgam of traditional qigong breathing
exercises and meditation, with elements of Buddhism and Taoism, to
enhance spiritual and physical well-being. The Communist Party has
mobilized its vast apparatus to demand that government offices and
work places all over the nation purge Falun Gong members and swear
allegiance to the party's Marxist ideology.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The article was brought to the attention of President Jiang
Zemin on May 5, 10 days after a huge demonstration by Falun Gong
supporters outside China's leadership compound in central Beijing,
said a Chinese political analyst with access to internal documents.
</P>
<P>
   In his article, which was circulated among senior military
officers, Li wrote that China's leaders should look kindly on the
spiritual movement. What is more, Li urged leaders to study Falun
Gong personally to improve their own physical and mental health.
</P>
<P>
   On May 5, Gen. Zhang Wannian, China's top military officer and
vice chairman of the Central Military Commission under Jiang, sent
a copy of the article to the president recommending that action be
taken against Li.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, who was deeply alarmed by the boldness of the challenge
to his authority implicit in the April 25 demonstration, wrote a
sharply-worded memorandum to fellow Politburo members identifying
Falun Gong as a serious threat to the Communist Party's existence.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was dated May 8, the day after NATO bombed the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia, which caused such outrage here that most
Chinese saw it as an affront to their national dignity. The
authorities permitted students to hold anti-American
demonstrations, which included throwing rocks at the U.S. Embassy
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   If Falun Gong masters can foresee everything, Jiang wrote, how
could they not predict the bombing of our embassy?
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Jiang instructed Gen. Wang Ke, the director of
the People's Liberation Army's General Logistics Department, to
visit Li to help him see the party's position more clearly.
</P>
<P>
   Li apparently buckled right away. Yet his confession was only
made public on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the confession, Li made it clear that he will now oppose the
teachings of Li Hongzhi, who founded Falun Gong in 1992 and now
lives in New York City. The two Li's are not related.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Li Hongzhi says that Falun Gong can cure all disease,
that is a ridiculous position and must be a way to trick people,''
Li was quoted as saying. ``Seeking medical treatment when you are
sick is common sense. If Falun Gong is really so powerful, why do
we need doctors, why do we need hospitals?''
</P>
<P>
   Li, a veteran of the communist military forces' Long March in
the mid-1930s, the defining political event of the party's founding
generation of leaders, has apparently been permitted to stay at
home, while many other Falun Gong leaders have been taken into
custody.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the structure and organization of Falun Gong have
remained deeply mysterious, staffed by faithful adherents who have
gone to extreme lengths to protect what they believe is a sacred
mission to propagate the teachings of Li Hongzhi, the crackdown is
gradually disclosing clues about its structure.
</P>
<P>
   Official media have reported that under the central leadership
of the Falun Dafa Research Society, there were 39 provincial-level
``general guidance stations'' and 1,900 lower-level ``guidance
stations'' spread all over China. For ordinary practitioners, the
authorities said, there were more than 28,000 practice sites,
mostly in urban parks and public places.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the authorities have starting producing
confessions from the heads and deputy heads of ``general guidance
stations'' in Jilin Province and Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide political campaign, Communist Party leaders in
each province are expected to produce the confession of the chief
local culprit, in this case Falun Gong leaders, so the number who
are actually brought forward may provide the best indication of how
well Beijing's campaign is going. If the number made public remains
small, it will be a sign that many others are refusing to confess.
If the number grows steadily, it will indicate the campaign's
success.
</P>
<P>
   One difficulty that Chinese leaders face in their crackdown on
Falun Gong is its amorphous, inchoate nature, which makes it
difficult to grasp and control. Another difficulty is Falun Gong's
home-grown nature, making it hard to cast as a foreign plot, a
favorite tactic in identifying a political enemy and one that was
used against the student-led movement of 1989 at Tiananmen Square
that called for more democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chinese officials have already pointed to a foreign role in
Falun Gong anyway, apparently because Li Hongzhi is based in the
United States and because much of the Internet-based communication
among Falun Gong leaders has come from members outside China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hostile Western forces are using `Westernization' and
`separatist' strategies to constantly carry out ideological and
cultural infiltration,'' the New China News Agency reported this
week.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong newspaper, Ming Pao, also reported that Jiang's memo
specifically pointed to ``behind-the-scenes involvement of foreign
forces'' in Falun Gong.

HINDU TEMPLE EXPANDS ITS COMPLEX TO ACCOMMODATE A DIVERSE
COMMUNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ At the D/FW Hindu Temple Society, worshippers
navigate their way around the yellow tape that cautions them as
they travel through the construction site attached to their main
temple of prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Dirt is turning at the Hindu Temple complex. And temple society
organizers are making room for a community of Hindus that began
with a few families meeting north of Dallas nearly 20 years ago and
now draws more than 1,260 members from throughout Fort
Worth-Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The temple, at 1605 N. Britain Road, has become an open door for
area Hindus seeking a place of refuge and worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what has happened is that we have been in a constant
state of expansion ever since we started,'' said Arlington resident
Phillip M. Ramsaroop, a member and past president of the temple
society. ``We have not stopped what we are doing, but we have
increased our activities. This, as far as I can see, will
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate continued growth in the area's Hindu community,
the temple society has undertaken a $1.5 million expansion project,
expected to be completed in about two years, said Fort Worth
resident Vinoda Kumar, a vice president of the temple society.
</P>
<P>
   When done, capacity in the main temple used for prayer will
increase from 600 to 850. In addition, the concrete-block buildings
will be shaped into a traditional Hindu-style temple by artists and
architects from India, said Padmakar Kulkarni, chairman of the
society's board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have big plans,'' Kulkarni said. ``It all depends on the
funds. We are careful not to do too much at one time.''
</P>
<P>
   The society's history demonstrates that point.
</P>
<P>
   It became official in 1983, meeting in rental properties in
Plano, north of Dallas. It bought property in Irving on the
northwestern outskirts of Dallas, about 11 years ago and moved
operations to an old house on the land before building a new temple
in 1991. Two years later, the society added a cultural center with
classrooms for religious education and language classes and a large
auditorium for meetings and wedding receptions.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the key to the society's continued growth has been
its openness to various expressions of Hinduism.
</P>
<P>
   The temple differs from others in India and in the United States
because it is not devoted to one deity, society organizers said. In
addition, instead of focusing on one set of traditions, it offers
communities from different Indian states and South America a place
to practice their individual rituals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a varied community, but at the same time, they are all
coming together,'' Kulkarni said. ``Here, everyone comes together
to make a united temple. Our constitution demands that everyone is
represented.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the temple society is an umbrella organization
that offers space and services to groups who trace their roots to
the Tamil, Bengali and Gujarati communities of India or Guyana, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Events at the temple are open to the entire community, and there
are statues of 14 deities of varying importance to the different
Indian communities represented at the temple. For example, the
Kerala community might organize an event to honor the deity Shri
Ayyappa, particularly important to traditions from the Kerala state
in India.
</P>
<P>
   However, events such as the Sept. 3 birthday celebration of Sri
Krishna will probably be attended by much of the membership,
organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   For Ramsaroop, who was born in Guyana and whose family
originally comes from northern India, being involved in the temple
has introduced him to Hindu traditions that he had only heard of in
passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``By associating myself with this community and seeing what they
do ... I recognize that we are not worshipping any different God,''
Ramsaroop said. ``It has made me a stronger person in my beliefs.
It has made me a better person.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the temple society plan to continue building on that
foundation by adding facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Once the temple expansion is complete, the society hopes to add
a youth center and a meditation center, and to expand the temple's
library.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it looks like a messy place,'' Kulkarni said. ``But give
us some time. You will see it taking shape.''

NEW LINCOLN SEDAN APPEALS TO YOUNGER SET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, there's a Lincoln sedan that ought to appeal to upscale
consumers whose hair is just beginning to gray.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 LS, a sporty performance sedan in the same vein as the
Lexus GS 400, represents a departure from past Lincolns and should
give Ford Motor Co. and its Lincoln-Mercury Division dealers some
hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not ready to pronounce the LS as good as a GS 400, but
that's OK. It costs about $10,000 less when comparably equipped.
And the LS brings to the market an American luxury car that
combines sporty performance, comfort and Japanese/European styling.
</P>
<P>
   There is a quick explanation for this unique combination:
Underneath, the Lincoln LS is really a Jaguar. It's based on the
same chassis as the all-new Jag S-series sedans. Ford says the two
vehicles share about 45 percent of their parts, although there are
significant styling differences and some differences in the way the
engines are built.
</P>
<P>
   The LS, whose styling was left to Lincoln-Mercury's California
design studio, is the first Lincoln product introduced since the
division pulled out of Detroit and moved to Southern California a
couple years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The LS and the new Jaguar XJS represent the first combined
efforts of Jag and Ford since Ford Motor Co. bought the English
carmaker in 1995. (The new Ford Thunderbird, which will be on its
way to market soon, is another vehicle that will share major
components with the Jaguar.)
</P>
<P>
   Along with the best-selling Lincoln Navigator sport-utility
wagon, the LS gives Lincoln dealers a two-vehicle arsenal with
which to attract affluent, professional baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   That's a radical departure from Lincoln's image during the past
quarter-century as a manufacturer of boatsize luxury cars that
attracted primarily blue-collar consumers at or near retirement
age.
</P>
<P>
   The LS is the car that Lincoln had to build, but it took way too
long. During the past 10 years, U.S. automakers have stood aside
wringing their hands in frustration as Japanese and European
luxury-car makers have taken solid control of one of the most
lucrative market segments.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Lexus, the upscale arm of Japan's Toyota, this revival
and expansion of the luxury-car market has largely left the
old-line U.S. luxury vehicles behind. Nothing from Cadillac or
Lincoln has come close to the best of Lexus, Honda's Acura,
Nissan's Infiniti, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   The image of the American luxury car as a huge, lumbering, cushy
vehicle loaded with glued-on gratuitous, gaudy trim has so
completely turned off affluent, still-somewhat-youthful buyers that
Cadillac and Lincoln dealers rarely saw anyone younger than 60 in
their showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But this new LS is aimed at changing that. If Lincoln-Mercury
can get the message across, this car could be a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Lexus GS sedans, the Lincoln LS comes in V-6 and V-8
models, and with the V-6, you can order a five-speed manual
transmission and sport package that turns the vehicle into a real
fun machine.
</P>
<P>
   Although the V-8 model isn't available with the manual gearbox,
there is an optional five-speed ``Selectshift'' automatic
transmission that allows the driver to shift manually without
having to bother with a clutch, similar to the Tiptronic automatic
in the Porsche 911.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are more than reasonable, beginning at $31,450 (plus $535
transportation) for a V-6 model with a five-speed automatic
transmission (without the Selectshift feature). The LS V-6 with
manual transmission and sport package lists for $32,250, and the
V-8 with regular five- speed automatic, which we tested, carries a
base sticker of just $35,225 (plus transportation).
</P>
<P>
   Even without adding anything, these cars come well-equipped.
Standard on all are automatic air-conditioning, 16-inch aluminum
wheels, power windows/door locks/driver's seat, premium
AM/FM/cassette stereo and cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   Under the hood, the choice is a 3.0-liter, double-overhead-cam
V-6 engine with 210 horsepower and 205 foot-pounds of torque; or
the 3.9-liter V-8, which cranks out 252 horsepower and 267
foot-pounds of torque. The V-8 is a modified version of Jaguar's
4.0-liter V-8. It's different enough to keep Jag owners happy that
their engine isn't in another vehicle that costs considerably less.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't driven the V-6 model, but the V-8 has plenty of power
even if it isn't as hot as the Jaguar. Road-handling
characteristics of the LS are decidedly un-Lincoln-like. This
vehicle handles more like a Jag than a Lincoln, cornering easily
and holding to curves like a sports car.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the LS is roomy and comfortable in a Lexus-style,
understated kind of way. There are two leather bucket seats up
front and a leather bench seat in the rear. Five adults can ride
comfortably, and there is a huge trunk for lots of suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   My only complaint with the LS is the limited visibility to the
sides because of large ``B'' and ``C'' pillars, those structural
supports between the front and back doors and at the sides of the
rear window of most sedans. They're just too wide.
</P>
<P>
   Extras on the LS cars include the convenience package ($850 on
V-6 models, standard on V-8), which brings automatic-dimming
rearview mirror, universal garage-door opener, moisture-sensitive
windshield wipers, a memory driver's seat, and power lumbar support
for driver and front passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The sport package ($1,000 on V-6 and V-8 automatics) adds
17-inch aluminum wheels with matching spare, a European-inspired
sport suspension system, the Selectshift automatic transmission,
body-color bumpers, an oil cooler, and a leather-wrapped steering
wheel and shift knob.
</P>
<P>
   A sun roof is available for $995, and a vehicle emergency
message system with built-in cellular phone lists for $960. Stereo
upgrades include the audiophile system ($565) and a six-disc, glove
box-mounted CD changer ($595).
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 18 miles per gallon in the city and
25 mpg on the highway for the V-6 automatics, and the tank holds
18.1 gallons. Ratings for the V-8 were not provided.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   AT A GLANCE: 1999 Lincoln LS sedan
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Full-size, four-door, five-passenger, V-6 or
V-8-powered, rear-wheel-drive, luxury performance sedan. An all-new
model from Lincoln based on the vehicle platform of the new Jaguar
S-series.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: Built to take on the Japanese and European
competition and attract affluent baby-boomers into Lincoln-Mercury
showrooms, this is the first American car to come close to the
styling and performance standards of imported luxury cars. There is
no silly gratuitous luxury. The LS is a no-nonsense sport sedan
that is comfortable yet fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVES: Side pillars between front and rear doors and at the
sides of the rear window block the driver's view to the sides, a
safety hazard. Major competitors: Lexus GS 300/400, Lexus ES 300,
Infiniti I30, Acura TL/RL, Mercedes-Benz E-class, BMW 5-series.
</P>
<P>
   FUEL ECONOMY: 18 miles per gallon city, 25 highway (V-6
automatic). Base price range: $31,450 to $35,225 plus $535
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD RATING: A.

 &HT;    SNL celebrates 25th season
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pasadena, Calif. _ No TV show invites more comparisons to its
own past than ``Saturday Night Live,'' where each year is compared
unfavorably to the years before it, until enough time passes and
even a season that was panned is lumped in with the classics.
</P>
<P>
   To Lorne Michaels, the show's creator and executive producer,
it's the nature of ``SNL,'' which this year begins its 25th season.
A two-and-a-half hour anniversary special, featuring past cast
members, hosts and musical guests, airs Sept. 26 at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   (The special airs, weirdly, on a Sunday, a kind of homage to
Brandon Tartikoff, the late NBC entertainment president who decided
to air the 15th anniversary special on a Sunday.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to say in the '70s that I thought the word `uneven'
would be on my tombstone, because it was in every review _ part of
the first sentence always involved the word `uneven,''' Michaels
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were starting, (baby boomers) felt we got it and an
older generation didn't. And then when things began to shift about
10 years ago and another generation began to express itself, the
baby boomers were just as intolerant as the generation before. And
we took an enormous amount of heat as a show from the press in 1993
and '94, about most of the people who now have movies out that are
successful this summer, and over the last couple summers (Adam
Sandler, Mike Myers).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a shift in generations, and I think it is
natural for what was once sort of music that you loved to turn into
`turn down that noise,''' Michaels added. ``If we were still doing
the show that we did in 1975, we'd be on TV Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it became a late-night phenomenon, then an institution, in
the mid-'70s, ``SNL'' has never been seriously challenged in its
time slot. Its main competitors now are ``Mad TV'' and, in some
markets, Howard Stern's show.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels said he had no idea how much longer the show could go
on, but that the real threat to ``SNL's'' future is probably not
another competitor, but the 500-channel universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of `Saturday Night Live' was the power of network
television, that people could talk about it the following day and
they'd all have the same experience,'' he said. ``As long as that
remains something Americans do, I think we'll be on the air. But I
think it will not be so much another show like us that knocks us
off. I think it will just be that there's more choices late at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's 25th anniversary is bittersweet for Michaels. Besides
being enormously successful, it has launched the careers of two
generations of comedic stars, from Bill Murray and Eddie Murphy, to
Dana Carvey and David Spade. But it has also produced some of the
comedic world's biggest tragedies, including John Belushi, Gilda
Radner and Chris Farley, all of whom died untimely deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first five years _ because nothing bad happened and we
sort of did it and then all went our separate ways _ there was sort
of a `Championship Season' feeling to it,'' Michaels said. ``On a
certain level, because people have been coming back and forth for
so long, you just sort of expect that you'll see people. And then
you go, `Oh, right.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't something I deal with on a day-to-day level. It's
just when I think about it, I get sad.''

CANCER STUDY ON VIEQUES COULD DELAY WHITE HOUSE DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal cancer-monitoring agency has opened an
investigation into Puerto Ricans' allegations that U.S. bombing
exercises have caused high levels of cancer on the Caribbean island
of Vieques, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The action by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry could delay a White House decision on the fate of a
bombing range that the Navy and Marine Corps have used for 58 years
to prepare Atlantic-based forces for deployment to Europe and the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Some Puerto Rican-born politicians, including Rep. Jose E.
Serrano, D-N.Y., and Delegate Carlos Romero-Barcelo, D-Puerto Rico,
say the White House decision could influence Puerto Rican political
support for Vice President Al Gore in his 2000 presidential
campaign and for First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in her
exploratory U.S. Senate campaign from New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Rear Adm. Andrew A. Granuzzo, the Navy's top
environmental protection officer, disclosed the Vieques cancer
inquiry in testimony before a Pentagon panel appointed at the
request of President Clinton to weigh continued live-fire training
on the island. Some 9,300 civilians live there adjacent to a
22,000-acre military bombing and ground maneuvers site.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``allegations of an increased rate of cancer for Vieques
citizens,'' Granuzzo said the Navy will work with the federal
cancer-monitoring agency to ``support their independent
investigation regarding this allegation .... even though there is
no reason to believe that Navy actions are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Block, the New York-based regional administrator for the
disease monitoring agency who has responsibility for Puerto Rico,
went there last week to meet with Navy officials, an agency
official said in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A team from the agency plans to visit Vieques next month. The
agency has 180 days to act on the citizen's request for an
investigation. A comprehensive study might take another year.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing and other combat-style exercises have been suspended on
the island since a Puerto Rican civilian employee of the Navy was
killed and four others were injured when a Marine pilot mistakenly
dropped two 500-pound bombs on an observation post during night
training.
</P>
<P>
   Navy and Marine Corps' officials, hoping to gain President
Clinton's go-ahead to resume live-fire training, insist that there
is not any scientific proof to support claims of high rates of
cancer raised by Puerto Rico's political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the Pentagon fact-finding panel who visited
Vieques last week said they heard vivid testimony about the high
rate of cancer. Local authorities described a neighborhood
devastated by the disease and said that infant mortality is higher
on Vieques than on the main island of Puerto Rico eight miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello, noting that the cancer risk is
``greater on Vieques than in any other municipality in Puerto
Rico,'' has urged the panel to launch a comprehensive health study
to determine if there is a connection with the chemicals contained
in the munitions, bombs, naval gunfire and Marine Corps' artillery
and mortar fire that are unleashed on Vieques each year.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members said the question of the incidence of cancer on
Vieques must be answered before Navy and Marine Corps' operations
can resume.
</P>
<P>
   One panel member, retired Marine Corps Gen. Richard Neal, noted
that Puerto Rico's citizens have voiced concern over a possible
increased cancer risk on Vieques for more than a decade without
gaining Navy attention.
</P>
<P>
   Another panel member, retired Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, D-Ind.,
asked the Navy's environmental specialist what the Navy would do if
studies were to detect a link between the bombing and cancer on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect we would have to modify our operations somewhat,''
replied Granuzzo, director of the environmental protection, safety
and occupational health division of the Chief of Naval Operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope so,'' Hamilton replied curtly. ``Obviously this
is something of extremely high sensitivity that we have to go
into.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Navy Vice Adm. Diego Hernandez, a Puerto Rico-born panel
member who formerly served as commander of the U.S. Caribbean
fleet, challenged Granuzzo's reply.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez invited Granuzzo to revise his statement that Navy
operations would merely be ``modified somewhat'' if federal health
studies conclude U.S. military exercises are causing a high
incidence of cancer among Puerto Rican civilians, who are U.S.
citizens by birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you want to let that stand in the record,''
Hernandez told Granuzzo. ``If there is cause and effect, the Navy
operation on Vieques is ended _ not `modified somewhat.'''
</P>
<P>
   Granuzzo did not change his statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez later told reporters he initially thought that
Granuzzo was ``being perhaps facetious,'' adding: ``That is an
absolutely impossible statement to accept on the part of anyone. If
there is a cause and effect relationship between Navy activities
and cancer on Vieques, operations are ended, liabilities are huge
and the human factor is indescribably difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said the Pentagon panel will have to submit its
recommendations on the future use of the Vieques bombing range to
the president by the end of August before the health studies are
complete.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Puerto Rican political leaders have united behind demands for a
permanent cessation of U.S. military operations on the 33,000-acre
island and the withdrawal of the Navy from the bombing range that
takes up two thirds of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano, the most senior Puerto Rican native in Congress, has
said the 2 million Puerto Ricans living in New York are watching to
see whether the president, the first lady and the vice president
support their demands for the Navy's eviction from Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Alcides Ortiz, executive director and general counsel of the
Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, which handles the
islands' dealings with the federal government, has said Puerto
Rican voters in the United States will take the outcome on Vieques
into account when they vote for senator in New York or president in
2000.

SHAGADELIC: BY ANY OTHER NAME POWERS PLAYS THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.   
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' hit big screens
in London Friday, the word ``shag'' _ British slang for ``to
copulate'' _ got the full-Monty-on-the-marquee treatment.
</P>
<P>
   New Line Cinema, which is distributing the film, refused to
change the title, even though some Brits may blush when they see
it. (The S-word raised a miniruckus among some Brits in America
earlier this summer after the movie's U.S. premiere.)
</P>
<P>
   New Line is keeping mum on its decision in Britain. But when
Austin Powers plays in other countries, the title will have to
behaaave, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some titles New Line said this week it has considered
or plans to use elsewhere:
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN _ ``La Espia Que Me Achucho''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``The Spy Who Hugged Me''
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE _ ``L Espion Qui M A Tire''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``The Spy Who Shot Me''
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY _ ``Austin Powers: Spion in Geheimer
Missionarsstellung''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``The Spy in Secret Missionary Position''
</P>
<P>
   LATIN AMERICA _ ``El Espia Seductor''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``The Seductive Spy''
</P>
<P>
   ICELAND _ ``Austin Powers: Njosuarinn Sem Neglani Mig''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``The Spy Who Nailed Me''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its affront to stiff-upper-lipped Brits, ``shag''
actually works smashingly _ prickly word purists be damned. The
title fits the hip, if slightly cockeyed story line of the Austin
Powers sequel _ a 1960s-era superspy in pursuit of his purloined
libido; it also fits the movie's essence of ``cool Brittania.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spy Who Engaged in Furtive Assignations With Me'' just
doesn't cut it!
</P>
<P>
   And ``shag'' _ while taboo in polite British society _ has

 &HT;    House cuts training funds for School of Americas
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For years, the School of the Americas at Fort
Benning, Ga., which is meant to teaching combat skills to Latin
American soldiers, has come under political attack.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) has gone so far as to call it the
``School of Assassins'' because of human rights abuses she says
were committed by some of its graduates.
</P>
<P>
   But the school's federal funding has never been in jeopardy _
until now.
</P>
<P>
   The House cut funding late Thursday that would pay for training
soldiers from South America, Central America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts by Reps. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.) and Mac Collins
(R-Ga.) to win support for the school's $1.3 million training
program next year, the House voted 230-197 to cut the program.
</P>
<P>
   The vote marked the first funding setback in the school's
45-year history. But the House action would eliminate only about 10
percent of the $20 million in federal funds earmarked for the
school. The rest of its funding is included in the Pentagon budget.
</P>
<P>
   The school's funding request is a mere sliver of the overall
$12.6 billion in the foreign operations appropriations bill, yet it
is one of the most controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the school trains 800 to 1,000 soldiers at its
Georgia campus near Columbus. Critics say it teaches terrorism and
torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accusations about teaching murder and torture ... are
based on pure propaganda and not on facts,'' Bishop said in a
heated floor speech Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The school has undergone 12 congressional investigations into
allegations that it teaches torture and murder, Bishop said. ``All
came to the same conclusion _ these charges are false.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising to oppose the school, Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said it was
``hard and difficult to differ from his colleague, friend and
brother from Georgia,'' but he could not support funding the
training program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been involved in some of the most outrageous
violations of human rights,'' Lewis said of the school's graduates.
``This is the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and McKinney were the only Georgians to support the
funding cut.
</P>
<P>
   Army Col. Glenn Weidner, who runs the Fort Benning school, said
there is ``no doubt that terrible things'' have happened in Latin
America. But, he said, fewer than 1 percent of the school's 60,000
graduates have been linked to atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main purposes of the school is to prevent atrocities
and establish stability in the region, Weidner said. The school
aims to foster camaraderie between the United States and Latin
America through the school's graduates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is to bring them here to train with us and that our
values will be absorbed by them,'' Weidner said. ``I deny
categorically that we train them to be terrorists. We are the U.S.
Army.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he hoped that the funding would be restored when
the foreign operations bill moves to a House and Senate committee
for approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would probably have a lot more conflict in that region if
it weren't for the school,'' Collins said. ``I don't think the
school will be closed. It is too important to our national
security.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not how McKinney sees it. She has been one of the
school's staunch opponents since her arrival in Congress in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely frustrated by the dismissive attitude of some
of our military establishment to the revelations that our soldiers
trained others to murder torture and terrorize civilians,''
McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), a member of the appropriations panel
in charge of funding the school's training program, said the school
has fallen prey to special interest politics.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston said he found it ``hypocritical'' of lawmakers to
salute members of the armed services on Memorial Day and then vote
to close an Army training school because opponents of the school
say ``the same members of the United States Army are training
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that it trains terrorists is ``plain malarkey,''
Kingston said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters display crosses with the names of Latin American
countries where the School of Americas allegedly operated on
Saturday, May 1, 1999, in Washington, D.C. Protesters from across
the country have come to the nation's capital in the wake of what
is claimed to be new evidence tying the U.S. Army training facility
at the U.S. Army's School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Ga., to
widespread torture and killings in Guatemala, Colombia, and Chile.

its graduates. Defenders say its impact is positive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has filed for
divorce from his wife of 18 years, saying his marriage is
``irretrievably broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich filed papers Thursday in the Superior Court of Cobb
County, Ga., stating that he and Marianne Gingrich have been
separated since May 10th and are working on a divorce agreement
that would ``resolve all matters and controversies between them.''
</P>
<P>
   The papers, filed by Gingrich's personal attorney J. Randolph
Evans, stated little else other than Gingrich has reserved his
right to ``set forth additional grounds for divorce'' if the
parties can not reach an amicable conclusion to the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   A hint that the divorce was not desired by both Gingriches came
by way of a one-sentence statement from Marianne Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marianne is saddened and disappointed at Newt's decision,''
said Victoria Toensing, her personal attorney based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This is Gingrich's second marriage. He divorced his first wife,
Jackie, two years after his 1978 election to Congress. Attempts to
reach the former speaker were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the couple say there have been problems in the
marriage dating back to Gingrich's unexpected resignation as
speaker of the House last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is best known leading the Republican Party's takeover
of the House in 1994. During that so-called Republican Revolution,
Gingrich emphasized that ``family values'' should be a core pillar
in American society.
</P>
<P>
   Friends in Georgia and Washington expressed sorrow, suggesting
that the years in the spotlight might have been the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad, but it's a fact of life and a high price to pay
(for being in public life),'' said Rich Galen, a longtime aide to
Gingrich in Washington. ``The stresses of public life that
occasionally become overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am heartbroken that this has happened,'' said former Georgia
State Rep. Matt Towery, a former campaign manager who has known
both Gingriches for two decades. ``All I hope is that they will be
able to resolve and end this relationship with the degree of
privacy and discretion of anyone who is in private life.''

NBC TEEN SHOW SEEKS REALISTIC LOOK IN CASTING ACTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Talk about diversity! Let's hope the cast of
``Freaks and Geeks'' doesn't take offense too easily.
</P>
<P>
   The new NBC dramatic series about high school life in 1980 has a
charming young cast, but they don't necessarily look as if they
stepped out of central casting. Producer Judd Apatow says it's by
design. ``At the beginning of the casting process,'' he explained,
``we just wanted to do a high school show that actually looked like
high school. My high school didn't look like any of the shows that
are on TV. There was maybe one gorgeous girl in school and, looking
back, she wasn't that hot, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Apatow said he and creator Paul Feig simply made a commitment to
cast accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you open up (the casting process) for what people really
look like,'' Apatow said, ``there's an enormous amount of really
talented people that might not, you know, get work on `Dawson's
Creek.'''
</P>
<P>
   _Aside from George Clooney, who left ``ER'' in the middle of
last season, the nation's most popular dramatic series has its full
complement of regulars returning for season No. 6. But it may not
be so easy to keep track of them. Garth Ancier, the new president
of NBC Entertainment, says three new characters are being added to
the show, another character from the first season is returning, a
recurring character from the past couple of years is becoming a
regular, and two prominent stars will make significant guest
appearances during the season.
</P>
<P>
   Scorecard ready? Here goes: The newcomers are Michael Michele
(``Homicide: Life on the Street'') as a second-year resident; Maura
Tierney (``NewsRadio'') as a charge nurse transferred from
intensive care, and Goran Visnjic (``Welcome to Sarajevo'') as a
Croatian physician who survived the Bosnian war. The returnee is
Ming-Na, formerly Ming-Na Wen, who will reprise the character of
Deb Chen from the first season. The new regular is Paul McCrane
(``The Shawshank Redemption''), who has played the slimy Dr. Romano
the past two seasons. And the prominent guest stars are Rebecca
DeMornay and Alan Alda, whose story lines Ancier declined to
reveal. He did say DeMornay's character will appear over a
five-show arc at the start of the season, and Alda's will be in
``many, many episodes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Odds 'n' ends: Now that ``Melrose Place'' is shuttered,
Heather Locklear will join the cast of ``Spin City'' for its fourth
season. She'll play Caitlin Moore, campaign manager of Mayor
Winston (Barry Bostwick), who has decided to run for the U.S.
Senate. Caitlin, we're told, won't get along too well with deputy
mayor Michael Flaherty (Michael J. Fox). ... Eunice Kennedy Shriver
and her son, Bobby, are executive producers of ``Mary &AMP; Jesus,'' a
two-hour movie slated for a November airing on NBC. Bobby Shriver
says it is not a duplication of CBS's four-hour miniseries,
``Jesus,'' also planned for next season. Shriver says his project
is mostly about Mary, and probably should be titled ``Mary of
Nazareth.'' Swedish actress Pernilla August plays Mary in the
Shriver project; Jacqueline Bisset will do the honors on CBS. The
non-dueling Jesuses are Christian Bale, a Welshman, on NBC, and
Jeremy Sisto, an American, on CBS. ... Martin Sheen plays the
president of the United States in Aaron Sorkin's new NBC drama,
``The West Wing.'' Sheen is proud of his Spanish-Irish heritage _
the name on his driver's license is Ramon Estevez _ but he doesn't
see himself as a standard bearer for minority actors, even though
NBC West Coast president Scott Sassa mentioned Sheen's Hispanic
heritage as a minority component of the ``West Wing'' cast. ``I've
been an actor for 40 years and I've played all kinds of parts,''
said the man who has portrayed both John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy
in films. ``I'm Hispanic by birth and I'm Irish by trade.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's call a truce in the seemingly never-ending war between
those who think the market can be beaten and those who don't. Here
are the terms: First, all investors must agree to invest major
portions of their portfolios _ half or more _ in index funds.
Second, devotees of index funds must stop demanding that we sink
every single penny into them and, instead, allow us to use active
fund managers, those who try to beat the market, for part of our
investing.
</P>
<P>
   Because of certain benefits that attend the partial-indexing
approach, I believe it would have a good chance of beating both an
all-indexing and an all-active-management approach
</P>
<P>
   Rather than viewing indexing as the enemy, active money managers
should see it as an ally that lets them do what they do best in a
climate that is shaped partly by two investor obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those obsessions is short-term focus. To be sure,
investors have never maintained the long-range perspective that
statisticians say is necessary for meaningful assessments of
portfolio managers' skills. But their focus has shortened markedly
over the last two decades _ especially in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1996 study by Galt Technologies, a data-providing
subsidiary of Intuit, 77 percent of investors who follow their
investments online check their portfolios' worth at least once a
week, and 21 percent check more than once a day.
</P>
<P>
   That constant checking of performance is not benign. Many
studies have shown that investors who do so are more likely to make
frequent and major changes and hence ignore the long-term picture.
</P>
<P>
   Portfolio managers today know that they are being judged on
their recent short-term returns. Investors often decide whether to
keep or drop a fund by looking at its performance over just a few
months. Indeed, some investment newsletters recommend doing so. Yet
I'm aware of no research showing that track records of a year or
less are meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   The other obsession is with so-called tracking error _ the
amount by which a manager's performance varies from a benchmark
like the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. Managers know they may
be dismissed if they fall too far behind benchmarks they've been
hired to beat. As a result, many managers don't stray far from the
stocks in their chosen index.
</P>
<P>
   Three finance professors _ Charles Cuny at the London Business
School, Mark Fedenia at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and
Robert Haugen, formerly at the University of California at Irvine,
researched the contents of fund portfolios, focusing on the 1969-89
period. They found that as Dec. 31 approached each year, managers
tended to make their portfolios look more like the stocks in the
indexes they follow. Year-end is also the time when many managers'
performance is judged.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the two investor obsessions make managers less willing
to take the risks needed to beat the market. The incentive to make
more money for clients is often outweighed by the disincentive to
allow performance to fall too far below a benchmark's. Some
managers prefer to fail conventionally than to succeed
unconventionally.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine a world in which investors put at least half of
their portfolios in index funds. Immediately, tracking error will
become less important to them, because only the rest of their
portfolios can deviate from the index. And because they will worry
less, they will give more freedom to an active manager to invest
that remainder.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, investors will loosen the straitjacket they have
placed on that manager, by reducing the short-term pressure to beat
an index. That will foster a healthier relationship between
investors and managers, in which the managers can take the risks
needed to have a fighting chance of beating the market long term.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread adoption of partial indexing does not guarantee, of
course, that active managers will beat the market; that remains a
difficult task. But it does create the conditions that improve the
chances of market-beating performance. Investors must be willing to
let managers take the long-term bets that will make them winners. &QL;

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Raised in the Depression and educated a
half-century ago in a South Texas few Hispanics can forget, Joe
Bernal has a special interest in the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bernal, 72, recalls when minority outreach by political
candidates consisted of paying a person's poll tax and, on good
days, getting some tamales and beer to wash down the ignominy of
casting a ballot for the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   At the local schoolhouse, ``no se habla Espanol'' (``Spanish is
not spoken here'') was the mantra and attempts to eradicate the
language from campuses across the Southwest were a constant
reminder that the United States was not run by people with names
like Gonzalez or Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was psychologically very damaging,'' Bernal said of the
efforts to bar native Spanish speakers from using their mother
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they were doing was making you believe that somehow or
another, your parents at home were giving you something that was
not good for you,'' said Bernal, a former state senator and current
member of the Texas Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 55 years after he last walked the halls of Lanier High
School wearing a ribbon that read, ``I speak English. I'm a good
American,'' Bernal is part of a generation of older Hispanics who
are at the same time amused and bemused by the current presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   They are watching and listening as the apparent front-runners in
the 2000 presidential race, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, create history by speaking Spanish at every
politically opportune moment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a Republican, won close to half the Hispanic vote in his
re-election as governor last year, leading Gore to campaign
rigorously to retain a traditionally Democratic voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Other presidential hopefuls, including Republican Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, are trying their best in English to woo the
nation's fastest-growing minority.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Barrera Sr., a San Antonio lawyer who was appointed Texas
secretary of state in 1968, said he never could have imagined as a
child that presidential candidates from both parties would be
freely using Spanish on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' the 72-year-old said. ``We were so
accustomed to believing that national candidates were something
other than Hispanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Chavez-Thompson, who worked as a child in the cotton
fields in the Texas Panhandle before becoming the highest-ranking
Hispanic woman in the nation's largest labor union, said her
81-year-old mother has been glued to Spanish-language television
for news about the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother has been so pleasantly surprised that she is seeing
two presidential candidates speaking her language,'' said
Chavez-Thompson, 54, the executive vice president of the AFL-CIO.
``Even me and my sisters, we're finding it absolutely enthralling
to hear it as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more skeptical and waiting for substantive issues to
match the rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking Spanish is one thing. But if you are bad on the
issues, it doesn't matter if you speak Spanish, Chinese and
German,'' said Albert Pena, 81, a former municipal court judge in
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Munguia, 81, who has supplied a generation of political
candidates with campaign signs from his San Antonio print shop,
said he views Spanish-speaking efforts by candidates who are less
than fluent in the language as ``paternalistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I going to be swayed by Governor Bush and Vice President
Gore speaking a few words in Spanish? I'm not buying it. Speak to
me in the language of the land,'' said Munguia, who is the uncle of
Henry Cisneros, the former secretary of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Hernandez, a visiting lecturer at St. Mary's University in
San Antonio who is writing a book about the Hispanic electorate,
said candidates risk a backlash if they don't soon move beyond the
symbolism of reaching out in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Latino voters are very sophisticated about this,''
Hernandez said. ``It's no a contest of who can say the most in
Spanish, but who says the most meaningful things.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the political motives, Hispanics are being courted
like never before _ and with good reason, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Once projected to become the largest minority group in the
United States by 2005, Hispanics are now expected to take over the
mantle with more than 32 million residents as soon as the 2000
Census is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic buying power in the United States also has risen to
$383 billion this year, a whopping 84 percent increase since 1990,
according to the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University
of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it is a numbers game and not, as Bernal puts it,
``that they (the country's political power brokers) love
`mexicanos' all in the sudden.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Rocha, a political scientist at the University of Texas
at El Paso, said the pragmatic thing for any national candidate to

``Son, what are you running for?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor,'' Gonzalez replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of Texas?'' the man said, his stoic face turning into a wide
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, of Texas,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, you don't have a Chinaman's chance,'' the man concluded
through a chuckle.

TARIFF DISPUTE BETWEEN ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL EASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Argentina has retreated from a threat to
impose punitive tariffs on Brazilian exports, easing a dispute
between the two countries that had threatened the cohesion of the
$1.1-trillion MERCOSUR trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The conciliatory gesture came during a surprise visit to
Brasilia on Thursday night by Argentine President Carlos Saul
Menem. Menem dined with President Fernando Henrique Cardoso at the
Alvorada Palace in a public display of friendship aimed at defusing
weeks of escalating commercial tension.
</P>
<P>
   Although significant differences on trade policy still remain
between South America's two largest economies, Menem's conciliatory
move is considered the first step in strengthening relations in a
trade bloc that has been damaged by a sharp reduction in economic
activity among its members.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil had halted all trade talks with Argentina earlier this
week after its largest neighbor said it was considering increases
in numerous tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common sense won out, calming everyone down,'' said Murillo de
Aragao, the head of a Brasilia political consulting firm, Arko
Advice, that has clients in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries now turn to more detailed trade issues like a
decision by Argentina to restrict imports of Brazilian textiles.
Another important subject of discussion will be Brazil's policy of
providing incentives to car makers to build factories in poor
regions, which Argentina has questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina and Brazil, together with Paraguay and Uruguay,
MERCOSUR's other two members, plan to discuss these issues next
week in Montevideo, the Uruguayan capital. Argentina and Brazil
also agreed to study ways to create more reliable negotiation
mechanisms within the trade bloc to deal with future differences.
No details were given on what sorts of mechanisms were under
consideration, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``MERCOSUR is big on the rhetoric, but when the haggling
re-emerges, who knows what will happen,'' said Riordan Roett, a
professor of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   MERCOSUR's members face other issues that are larger and more
complex and that are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the trade bloc is grappling with the idea of
adopting a common currency similar to the euro. Argentina, whose
economy was badly damaged as a result of Brazil's devaluation of
its currency, the real, earlier this year, is the strongest
proponent of such a plan. Brazil, which is getting used to a
free-floating currency after more than four years of pegging the
value of the real to the dollar, is less enthusiastic.

CANCER STUDY ON VIEQUES COULD DELAY WHITE HOUSE DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Filed in ``w'' and ``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal cancer-monitoring agency has opened an
investigation into Puerto Ricans' allegations that U.S. bombing
exercises have caused high levels of cancer on the Caribbean island
of Vieques, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The action by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry could delay a White House decision on the fate of a
bombing range that the Navy and Marine Corps have used for 58 years
to prepare Atlantic-based forces for deployment to Europe and the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Some Puerto Rican-born politicians, including Rep. Jose E.
Serrano, D-N.Y., and Delegate Carlos Romero-Barcelo, D-Puerto Rico,
say the White House decision could influence Puerto Rican political
support for Vice President Al Gore in his 2000 presidential
campaign and for First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in her
exploratory U.S. Senate campaign from New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Rear Adm. Andrew A. Granuzzo, the Navy's top
environmental protection officer, disclosed the Vieques cancer
inquiry in testimony before a Pentagon panel appointed at the
request of President Clinton to weigh continued live-fire training
on the island. Some 9,300 civilians live there adjacent to a
22,000-acre military bombing and ground maneuvers site.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``allegations of an increased rate of cancer for Vieques
citizens,'' Granuzzo said the Navy will work with the federal
cancer-monitoring agency to ``support their independent
investigation regarding this allegation .... even though there is
no reason to believe that Navy actions are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Block, the New York-based regional administrator for the
disease monitoring agency who has responsibility for Puerto Rico,
went there last week to meet with Navy officials, an agency
official said in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A team from the agency plans to visit Vieques next month. The
agency has 180 days to act on the citizen's request for an
investigation. A comprehensive study might take another year.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing and other combat-style exercises have been suspended on
the island since a Puerto Rican civilian employee of the Navy was
killed and four others were injured when a Marine pilot mistakenly
dropped two 500-pound bombs on an observation post during night
training.
</P>
<P>
   Navy and Marine Corps' officials, hoping to gain President
Clinton's go-ahead to resume live-fire training, insist that there
is not any scientific proof to support claims of high rates of
cancer raised by Puerto Rico's political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the Pentagon fact-finding panel who visited
Vieques last week said they heard vivid testimony about the high
rate of cancer. Local authorities described a neighborhood
devastated by the disease and said that infant mortality is higher
on Vieques than on the main island of Puerto Rico eight miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello, noting that the cancer risk is
``greater on Vieques than in any other municipality in Puerto
Rico,'' has urged the panel to launch a comprehensive health study
to determine if there is a connection with the chemicals contained
in the munitions, bombs, naval gunfire and Marine Corps' artillery
and mortar fire that are unleashed on Vieques each year.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members said the question of the incidence of cancer on
Vieques must be answered before Navy and Marine Corps' operations
can resume.
</P>
<P>
   One panel member, retired Marine Corps Gen. Richard Neal, noted
that Puerto Rico's citizens have voiced concern over a possible
increased cancer risk on Vieques for more than a decade without
gaining Navy attention.
</P>
<P>
   Another panel member, retired Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, D-Ind.,
asked the Navy's environmental specialist what the Navy would do if
studies were to detect a link between the bombing and cancer on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect we would have to modify our operations somewhat,''
replied Granuzzo, director of the environmental protection, safety
and occupational health division of the Chief of Naval Operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope so,'' Hamilton replied curtly. ``Obviously this
is something of extremely high sensitivity that we have to go
into.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Navy Vice Adm. Diego Hernandez, a Puerto Rico-born panel
member who formerly served as commander of the U.S. Caribbean
fleet, challenged Granuzzo's reply.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez invited Granuzzo to revise his statement that Navy
operations would merely be ``modified somewhat'' if federal health
studies conclude U.S. military exercises are causing a high
incidence of cancer among Puerto Rican civilians, who are U.S.
citizens by birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you want to let that stand in the record,''
Hernandez told Granuzzo. ``If there is cause and effect, the Navy
operation on Vieques is ended _ not `modified somewhat.'''
</P>
<P>
   Granuzzo did not change his statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez later told reporters he initially thought that
Granuzzo was ``being perhaps facetious,'' adding: ``That is an
absolutely impossible statement to accept on the part of anyone. If
there is a cause and effect relationship between Navy activities
and cancer on Vieques, operations are ended, liabilities are huge
and the human factor is indescribably difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said the Pentagon panel will have to submit its
recommendations on the future use of the Vieques bombing range to
the president by the end of August before the health studies are
complete.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Puerto Rican political leaders have united behind demands for a
permanent cessation of U.S. military operations on the 33,000-acre
island and the withdrawal of the Navy from the bombing range that
takes up two thirds of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano, the most senior Puerto Rican native in Congress, has
said the 2 million Puerto Ricans living in New York are watching to
see whether the president, the first lady and the vice president
support their demands for the Navy's eviction from Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Alcides Ortiz, executive director and general counsel of the
Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, which handles the
islands' dealings with the federal government, has said Puerto
Rican voters in the United States will take the outcome on Vieques
into account when they vote for senator in New York or president in
2000.

LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE TO ISSUE SHARES

<P>
   LONDON _ With the world's stock exchanges increasingly
challenged by upstart electronic trading networks, the august
London Stock Exchange on Friday announced plans to end almost two
centuries of clubby mutual ownership by issuing tradeable shares to
its members.
</P>
<P>
   The move, depicted by the exchange as part of a quest for a new
corporate agility, is similar to steps announced by the New York
Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market, which face even greater
threats than European exchanges from electronic communications
networks, known by their initials ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement by the London exchange, which claims to be
the world's oldest, raised questions about the future of stalled
efforts led by the London and Frankfurt exchanges to create a
pan-European stock exchange from eight existing institutions. The
year-old negotiations have come to a halt amid disputes over
ownership and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some bankers said that rapid technological advances
facilitating smaller, cheaper and more nimble electronic trading
platforms could eclipse the more staid, traditional exchanges by
creating pan-European networks of their own. ``If the major
exchanges don't move quickly enough, the ECNs will,'' said Ronald
Cohen, chairman of Apax Partners &AMP; Co., a private equity company
with minority stakes in two electronic trading outfits _ the
Tradepoint alternative stock exchange in Britain, and Easdaq, a
pan-European market for high-growth stocks that plans to list its
stock on Nasdaq in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The planned changes at the London Stock Exchange, which need
approval from 75 percent of its 294 members, represent the biggest
shift in the way the organization is run since the so-called Big
Bang of 1986 when it moved away from the floor trading system still
used at the New York Stock Exchange to screen-based trading.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Muncer, a spokesman for the London Stock Exchange, said the
detailed workings of the new system still had to be formulated and
he indicated that London exchange officials were not at present
contemplating the same full public stock offering as the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the move was designed to give the London Stock
Exchange more flexibility in raising capital for new, competitive
ventures and in accelerating decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Gavin Casey, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange,
said that ``greater speed and flexibility than ever before'' were
needed ``for London to stay ahead in today's technology-driven
market-place.''
</P>
<P>
   Some American investment firms with big trading operations here
welcomed the move. Tom Troy, head of European equities at Merrill
Lynch, said the firm was ``very supportive of its
demutualization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Market structures globally are evolving quickly,'' he added,
``and the London Stock Exchange's move to further modernize itself
will provide it with the commercial edge needed to compete in the
new order.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the quandary facing the London exchange was part of a
much broader contest between the established national exchanges and
the technology that is reshaping the international marketplace for
stocks. ``This isn't a phenomenon of just the London Stock Exchange
or the City of London,'' he said. ``This is a global phenomenon
that's affecting all the major exchanges around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, for instance, 30 percent of trades in
companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange are done through electronic
communication networks. Around 15 percent of all trades are done in
on-line trading. The European figures are far less but growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'll see the volume of day-trading and retail
in quite the way as in the U.S.,'' said Richard Kilsby, chief
executive of the Tradepoint exchange, which was recently
recapitalized by a consortium of United States and other investment
banks and institutions. ``But I do think there's great latent
demand and volume for European stocks. It's not just around the
corner. But it's not far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Thursday, 19 institutions here including Barclays Global
Investors Ltd. and Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management,
announced plans to create a European trading network called
E-Crossnet Ltd., designed to undercut existing transaction costs.
In the United States last week, the Charles Schwab Corp. on and
Fidelity Investments, the leading mutual funds investment company,
started an electronic network with two other companies, reflecting
the boom in retail, on-line trading that has helped fuel Wall
Street's bull run.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the traditional exchanges are challenged by such
institutions as the Instinet Corp., owned by Reuters Group PLC, and
Tradebook, owned by Bloomberg LP.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid expansion of electronic trading contrasts sharply with
the ponderous negotiations to fuse Europe's existing stock
exchanges into a single system, a move initially inspired by the
approach of the euro single currency, which was introduced in 11
European countries last January.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between the London Stock Exchange and Frankfurt's
Deutsche Borse, which have made progress in such areas as
harmonized working hours, are close to deadlock on several other
issues, people close to those discussions said. The two exchanges,
these people said, have failed to agree on a common trading
technology.
</P>
<P>
   That has inspired sentiment that the discussions will be
overtaken by technologically driven market forces. ``If London and
Frankfurt, in a very timely manner, are not able to come up with a
credible structure then I think the alternative trading systems
will do that,'' said Troy at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The disarray among the European exchanges is accentuated by wide
differences in their ownership structures. Of all eight, for
instance, only Sweden's Stock Exchange is owned by a traded company
_ OM Gruppen AB. Others, such as the Frankfurt and Zurich exchanges
are dominated by German and Swiss banks and have said they have no
plans to go public. The Amsterdam exchange demutualized in 1997 and
plans to issue shares by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's move by the London exchange, however, raised
speculation that all will come under pressure to change along the
same lines. The exchanges, said Cohen of Apax Partners, ``find it
difficult to go beyond national borders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are symbols of national pride and don't operate like a
normal company,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But, after Friday's development, he said, ``my guess is that
this will start a chain reaction of all European exchanges
demutualizing, moving away from politics and into business.''

COLD FACTS ABOUT CHILD LABOR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DANIEL AKST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few of the world's ills arouse such revulsion as child labor.
When we learn that children are sewing soccer balls instead of
studying, we are aghast. Kathie Lee Gifford, stung by allegations
that her line of clothing at Wal-Mart was tainted by child labor,
condemned the practice before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton addressed the International Labor Organization
on the same terrible subject.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with some trepidation that I raise a small voice in
dissent from therse noble efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Of course we're all against children being chained to machinery
and forced to work day and night in unsanitary conditions for
pennies a week. Alas, there is more to it than that, and the whole
subject is so clouded by myth and sentiment that some hard truths
have been lost in the haze.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest is that laboring children in Pakistan, Honduras,
Guatemala and similarly impoverished places generally work to
support their families, and the people devoted to rescuing them
haven't the slightest hope of offering an alternative. For the
unfortunate children, living in lands without a social safety net
and in households where the adults cannot provide for them, the
alternative isn't school; it's starvation.
</P>
<P>
   What the poorest nations need most is economic development, the
only known route to the enlightened social and economic system _
complete with women's rights, environmental protection, and yes, a
ban on child labor _ that all of us want for these children in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the labor of children has been an inevitable
ingredient in economic development, and kids at work are far from a
shocking new consequence of the dark forces of globalization (you
know, the forces that are doing more for world prosperity and peace
than any government ever has). Not only have children always
worked, but for much of history, labor was the point of children,
who invariably helped in the fields.
</P>
<P>
   When families left the farms, children worked with their parents
at whatever trade the adults took up. As grown-ups went to work in
factories, children followed. Like most revolutions, the industrial
one wasn't pretty, but one of its many eventual benefits was
raising incomes high enough to afford the ideal of the sheltered
childhood, a golden time set aside for play, study and parental
dependence. The best childhood, in other words, that money could
buy.
</P>
<P>
   My own sons, I hope, will not have to work in order to eat until
they are adults. Along with practically everyone else in the world,
I fervently wish for the day when all children are free of this
burden and can obsess instead over the year's hottest new toy or
teen idol. But it's a fact that forbidding child labor in the
Pakistans or Guatemalas of today will not hasten that happy day.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, there is a country where children routinely
work not to put food on the table, but merely to leap all the
sooner onto the treadmill of consumption. In this benighted land,
57 percent of the 14-year-olds are working for money; among white
14-year-olds, the most affluent subset, the rate is higher still.
</P>
<P>
   And while the children of this land, by some measures the
world's richest nation, busy themselves flipping burgers and
stocking grocery shelves, they score dismally as a group on
international tests of academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The country, of course, is the United States. And even here, the
alarm about children working instead of studying is misplaced. A
study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that American
children who work seem to do so instead of watching television.
</P>
<P>
   What the bureau didn't ask the teen-agers was how they spent
their money. It's a fair bet that some of it goes to buy stylish
apparel and shoes made in Third World countries _ by other
children.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe America's working kids deserve a pat on the back. By
spending their earnings at the mall, they are transferring some
wealth overseas to children who need it far more. Sure, much of it
is skimmed off along the way by middlemen and marketers. But the
track record of most conventional international development
programs is no better. At least we know that this mechanism works. &QL;

CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE FINANCIAL CONGLOMERATE IS REPLACED 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China Everbright Group, one of the nation's largest
financial conglomerates, announced Friday that its chairman had
resigned and been replaced by a deputy governor of the People's
Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
   The move, officially described as a normal transfer, appeared
instead to be one of several personnel moves related to the
shifting fortunes of Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, whose reform
program has been under attack from conservative rivals in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The departing chairman of China Everbright, Zhu Xiaohua, was one
of China's most prominent executives, a relatively aggressive and
ambitious financial operative in an environment that favors
political caution and bureaucratic timidity.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, China Everbright's chairman since 1996, was widely reported
to enjoy a close relationship with Prime Minister Zhu, who is no
relation. The prime minister has been trying to spearhead sharp
reform in China's lumbering financial sector, where state-run
companies are plagued by mismanagement and bureaucratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although China Everbright is considered one of the brighter
stars in the collection of Hong Kong-based, China-owned financial
companies, it is widely regarded as lacking the efficiency and
flexibility of private competitors in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   China Everbright runs a wide range of businesses that extend
from securities trading to banking to toll collection. It reports
directly to China's State Council, or cabinet. It has three
subsidiaries that are publicly listed in Hong Kong: China
Everbright, China Everbright Technology and China Everbright
International.
</P>
<P>
   Like other state-run companies, China Everbright does not
publicly report revenue or profit, and much of its other financial
data are not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   China Everbright's commercial banking arm, Everbright Bank of
China, had more than $10 billion in assets at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong newspapers reported rumors that Zhu Xiaohua was under
investigation for his role in bad deals that had lost more than
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   But in a field of state-owned financial companies where enormous
losses are routinely written off, other, still unclear factors may
also have been at play.
</P>
<P>
   An investment banker at another Chinese company said Zhu's
removal had more to do with Beijing politics than with China
Everbright's balance sheet. A related move, the banker said, is the
expected removal of Wang Qishan, deputy governor of Guangdong
Province, who was sent by Prime Minister Zhu to sort out the
financial mess left there by state-run companies, namely the
Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't see what the whole picture is,'' the banker said.
``But these moves are all related.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Zhu's aggressive reform program is said to have
been sharply criticized by fellow Politburo members in Beijing,
where the political atmosphere has become unusually tense and
volatile. Leaders are currently confronted with crises over Taiwan,
the spiritual movement Falun Gong, and strained U.S.-China
relations, on top of a vulnerable economy and rising unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   China Everbright's new chairman, Liu Mingkang, served for 11
years as a deputy governor of China's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his background is as much in politics as in finance. Before
joining the People's Bank, Liu was a vice governor of Fujian
province. He has an MBA from London's City University.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Hong Kong, where Everbright is based,
Liu said he would not change his predecessor's strategy of focusing
on financial services businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial industry is our core business,'' Liu said.
``That means commercial banking _ including personal banking,
institutional banking, corporate banking _ and I am very happy to
see that our commercial banking is getting stronger and stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   He denied that Zhu's removal was unusual in any way.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, this is part of normal operations,
nothing more, nothing less,'' Liu said.

EVEN HISTORY OF KOSOVO IS A MATTER OF DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to add byline information)  (yn) 
 By ERIC ALTERMAN   
Eric Alterman is the author of ``Who Speaks for America? Why
Democracy Matters in Foreign Policy'' (Cornell University Press,
1998). 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a more perfect world, the warring sides in ethnic disputes
over territory and equitable treatment might lay down their arms
and submit themselves to a panel of historical experts who would
study the record and determine which side's claims had greater
merit. There would be a ruling, and each side would retire its
unjustifiable demands in the face of superior historical
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Were such a world ever to come into being, books about such
contemporary historical disputes as the fate of Kosovo would be
fought over with an even greater degree of ferocity than they are
today. Even now, challenging a historical claim considered by many
to be a matter of life and death is not work for the faint of
heart. As Ernest Renan, a French historian and essayist, said a
century ago, ``Getting history wrong is an essential part of being
a nation.'' Just consider how the Serbian leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, exploited the history of a battle that occurred more
than 600 years ago to legitimize nationalist claims to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Separating documentable truths from widely shared myths is no
easy task. Kosovo's historical tableau has been carved upon at
various moments by Romans, Byzantines, Bulgarians, Vlachs, Germans,
Hungarians, Turks, Gypsies, Jews and Circassians, as well as Serbs
and Albanians. Roman Catholicism, Orthodox Islam and Judaism have
all played an influential role in determining the life of the area,
to say nothing of Communism, Fascism and nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars from various disciplines have tried to unravel the
Balkans' tangled past. One writer recently counted 160 books
dealing with the region published in only the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Verdery, a professor of anthropology at the University
of Michigan, for instance, just published a study on the way ``dead
bodies on the move'' _ her expression for repeated reburials of
ancestors and historical heroes _ have helped shape traditionally
religious societies emerging from Communism. The book, ``The
Political Lives of Dead Bodies: Reburial and Post-Socialist
Change'' (Columbia University Press, 1999), explores the
post-mortem travels of Prince Lazare of Serbia, whose traveling
bones have done so much to roil the Serbian population 600 years
after his death and inspire the patriotic fervor that helped set
off the war in Kosovo. (American Navy and Army welders recently
repaired a statue of Lazare that had been lassoed and pulled to the
ground by several hundred Albanians.)
</P>
<P>
   Taking another tack, Maria Tedorov's ``Imagining the Balkans''
(Oxford University Press, 1997) points to a history of Western
distortion in the portrayal of Balkan societies not unlike that
pursued by Edward Said in his landmark study of the representation
of the East, ``Orientalism.'' Ms. Tedorov calls into question
whether outsiders can ever understand the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Wars have a way of calling attention to scholarly specialties
that tend to get unnoticed otherwise, offering a historian 15
minutes of fame _ or at least a 15-second sound bite on television.
Given the continued fighting in the region, it is perhaps
unavoidable that reactions to this history are colored by the
politics of the day. It is a place where history bleeds into the
present. President Clinton was said to be heavily influenced by
Robert D. Kaplan's ``Balkan Ghosts'' (Random House, 1994), which
implied that no solution was possible in an area so fraught with
``ancient hatreds.'' People close to the president said reluctance
to get involved in the Balkans in the early 1990s was at least
partially attributable to the book's influence on the president's
understanding of the region's history.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   When the action switched to Kosovo, the United States adopted a
much more assertive policy in the area. In this case, two of the
books that have come to dominate the debate among scholars and
policymakers take direct aim at the ``ancient-hatreds'' school of
history.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda Vickers' ``Between Serb and Albanian: A History of
Kosovo'' (Columbia University Press, 1998) focuses primarily on the
20th-century history of the province. Ms. Vickers argues that the
conflict began in earnest when the Yugoslavian regime incorporated
the Kosovar Albanians, and then instituted periods of repression
and intolerance that destroyed the uneasy balance between the two
ethnic populations there.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Noel Malcolm's book, ``Kosovo: A Short History'' (New
York University Press, 1998), demonstrates that the area now called
Kosovo enjoyed a long period of peaceful coexistence and sometimes
even cooperation between the Serb and Albanian populations of the
area. Like Ms. Vickers, he blames the recent troubles virtually
exclusively on the ambitions of late 20th-century Serb nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   What has made Malcolm's work particularly controversial is the
manner in which he puts a torch to virtually every sacred myth the
Serbs hold dear, along with a few of the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm, who taught at Cambridge University for seven years, has
taken aim at many of the accepted conventions of Serbian history.
Like other historians before him, he disputes the Serbs' sacred
founding myth, that the courageous though unsuccessful resistance
of the Serbs to the Ottoman Turks in Kosovo in 1389 ended the
Serbian empire. He says it began to fall apart three decades
earlier. And he takes issue with another myth: that when the
Austrian Army penetrated Kosovo in 1689 and forced the Ottoman
Turks out of the region, the Serbian Orthodox patriarch, Arsenije
Crnojevic, inspired the local Serbs to join the Austrians against
the Turks; that on New Year's Day, 1690, the Austrians were
defeated in battle by the Turks, and that Crnojevic then led a
retreat from Kosovo, allowing the Muslim Albanians to settle the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm insists that Austrians were met not by Crnojevic, but by
the Albanian Catholic archbishop, Pjeter Bogdani. Moreover, he
says, the patriarch led no ``Great Migration'' of Serbs out of
Kosovo but simply cut and ran.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Judah, writing in The New York Review of Books, likened
Malcolm's task to ``someone claiming that the Mayflower sailed from
America to Britain or that Ellis Island had little to do with
immigration to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm has also questioned some of Kosovo's more recent
history. He argues that the portrayal of Yugoslavians' resistance
to the Nazis has been exaggerated and deployed as pro-Serb
propaganda. He says, for example, that only four German divisions,
not hundreds, were kept in Yugoslavia during the occupation. Nor
did Tito manage to tie up Hitler's forces, as the Serbs claim.
Malcolm writes that ``Tito's `liberation' of areas of remote
countryside'' did not ``affect the German war effort in any vital
way: the Germans and Italians continued to control the large towns,
the major roads and railways, and the mines.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have taken issue with Malcolm for his attachment to
old-fashioned forms of historical narrative. Karen Barkey, a
sociologist at Columbia at work on a study of the Balkans, finds
Malcolm's version simplistic. To believe that there can be ``one
single correct history,'' Ms. Barkey says, ``misses the way in
which facts are created and how people make their own history by
shaping their own myths.''
</P>
<P>
   Those with a particular sensitivity to Serb concerns, however,
have accused Malcolm's history of being tainted by ideology. Alexa
Djilas, a Montenegran Serbian writer who recently returned to
Belgrade from the United States, complained in Foreign Affairs
magazine: ``It is tempting to dismiss Malcolm as a popularizer or
charlatan. His account is marred by his sympathies for the
Albanians and his illusions about the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   There is more at stake than scholarly reputations. Letters to
the editor of Serbian publications during the war frequently
invoked 1389 as its justification. And even American senators and
congressmen have mentioned the gilded version of Yugoslav
resistance to the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nations do not easily give up their myths to
historians. As the historian Eric Hobsbawm once observed:
``Unfortunately, the one thing historical experience has taught
historians is that nobody ever seems to learn from it. Still we
must go on trying.''

   AN INITIAL GAIN IN AN AD CAMPAIGN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There it is, in bold type in a newspaper ad: ``HRC. Because New
Yorkers expect the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Many a New Yorker might have done a double take; after all,
Hillary Rodham Clinton's all-but-announced campaign for the Senate
hasn't officially begun. But the ads are actually promoting the New
York Health and Racquet Club, a chain in the city whose HRC logo
looks as if it could be the first lady's monogram.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Dickinson, a spokeswoman for the chain, said it never
intended to trade on the coincidence. The club is ``pleased to
support America in general,'' Ms. Dickinson said, but she stressed
that the chain is not at all political. ``We just happen to have
the same initials,'' she said. ``We sent her a T-shirt one time
because of the similarities.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Mrs. Clinton's camp hadn't noticed the ads but was
hardly complaining. ``It sounds like a pretty good slogan,'' said a
chuckling Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I will change my membership over there,'' Wolfson added.
After all, the club, unlike politics, offers a money-back
guarantee.

CONGRESSMAN M.D. LECTURES INTERNS ABOUT SAFE SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``l'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While congressional committees met Friday to
discuss Internet commerce, drug addiction and international
affairs, Rep. Tom Coburngathered some 300 young congressional
interns to eat pizza and listen to his lecture about safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   The message from the three-term Republican from Oklahoma _ who
also is a physician: If you want to avoid painful, debilitating and
potentially deadly sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs, abstain
from sex until marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In a U.S. Capitol hall usually reserved for lectures on
economics and national security and resplendent with photographs of
official Washington, Coburn punctuated his presentation with a
graphic slide show detailing the ravages of chlamydia, gonorrhea,
herpes and the human papillomavirus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an epidemic of STDs,'' said Coburn, who specializes in
family medicine and obstetrics back home in his rural northeastern
Oklahoma district. ``The problem is that not many people know
there's an epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem with many of the 25 known STDs, he said, is that
they often go undetected.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional internships are an prized institution, often
sought by college students and recent graduates hoping to break
into the politics industry. The internships provide free labor to
lawmakers, while giving young adults a first-hand look at the inner
workings of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn has given his safe-sex lecture to interns for the last
five summers. He says his audience is in the age group which STDs
strike with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   In Coburn's slide presentation, a picture tells the story more
vividly than statistics: Images of genital warts erupting on male
and female genitals, a swollen and cracked cervix infected with
virulent chlamydia, a penis consumed by a bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Several interns stopped eating their pizza, while some others
groaned aloud as the slides flashed on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, a social conservative from the House class of 1994 that
wrested control of Congress from Democrats, argued that sexual
abstinence was the only sure way to avoid infection. Condoms, he
said, don't stop the spread of HPV because the virus can be
transmitted by contact with an infected scrotum, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, who will relinquish his seat at the end of his term,
said HPV was ``the meanest virus I have ever dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   His slides showed these statistics culled from the Centers for
Disease Control, the Journal of the American Medical Association
and the Institute of Medicine, a private medical group that advises
the U.S. government:
</P>
<P>
   _ About 15 million new cases of STD infections are reported each
year, and approximately two-thirds occur in people under 25 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   _ Twenty-five percent of all new infections from HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS, are in people under 22 years old.
</P>
<P>
   _ A higher percentage of 15-19 year-olds are infected with
gonorrhea than any other age group.
</P>
<P>
   The interns ``are very appreciative because many have never been
taught these things by health teachers,'' said John Hart, a
spokesman for Coburn. ``You don't see this on an episode of `Bay
Watch' or `Melrose Place,''' he said, referring to TV shows with
sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   One 20-year old female intern from Florida, who already has
learned the tried-and-true Washington practice of declining to be
named in a news article, told a reporter that the presentation was
``really scary.''
</P>

CONGRESSMAN M.D. LECTURES INTERNS ABOUT SAFE SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``l'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While congressional committees met Friday to
discuss Internet commerce, drug addiction and international
affairs, Rep. Tom Coburngathered some 300 young congressional
interns to eat pizza and listen to his lecture about safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   The message from the three-term Republican from Oklahoma _ who
also is a physician: If you want to avoid painful, debilitating and
potentially deadly sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs, abstain
from sex until marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In a U.S. Capitol hall usually reserved for lectures on
economics and national security and resplendent with photographs of
official Washington, Coburn punctuated his presentation with a
graphic slide show detailing the ravages of chlamydia, gonorrhea,
herpes and the human papillomavirus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an epidemic of STDs,'' said Coburn, who specializes in
family medicine and obstetrics back home in his rural northeastern
Oklahoma district. ``The problem is that not many people know
there's an epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem with many of the 25 known STDs, he said, is that
they often go undetected.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional internships are an prized institution, often
sought by college students and recent graduates hoping to break
into the politics industry. The internships provide free labor to
lawmakers, while giving young adults a first-hand look at the inner
workings of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn has given his safe-sex lecture to interns for the last
five summers. He says his audience is in the age group which STDs
strike with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   In Coburn's slide presentation, a picture tells the story more
vividly than statistics: Images of genital warts erupting on male
and female genitals, a swollen and cracked cervix infected with
virulent chlamydia, a penis consumed by a bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Several interns stopped eating their pizza, while some others
groaned aloud as the slides flashed on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, a social conservative from the House class of 1994 that
wrested control of Congress from Democrats, argued that sexual
abstinence was the only sure way to avoid infection. Condoms, he
said, don't stop the spread of HPV because the virus can be
transmitted by contact with an infected scrotum, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, who will relinquish his seat at the end of his term,
said HPV was ``the meanest virus I have ever dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   His slides showed these statistics culled from the Centers for
Disease Control, the Journal of the American Medical Association
and the Institute of Medicine, a private medical group that advises
the U.S. government:
</P>
<P>
   _ About 15 million new cases of STD infections are reported each
year, and approximately two-thirds occur in people under 25 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   _ Twenty-five percent of all new infections from HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS, are in people under 22 years old.
</P>
<P>
   _ A higher percentage of 15-19 year-olds are infected with
gonorrhea than any other age group.
</P>
<P>
   The interns ``are very appreciative because many have never been
taught these things by health teachers,'' said John Hart, a
spokesman for Coburn. ``You don't see this on an episode of `Bay
Watch' or `Melrose Place,''' he said, referring to TV shows with
sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   One 20-year old female intern from Florida, who already has
learned the tried-and-true Washington practice of declining to be
named in a news article, told a reporter that the presentation was
``really scary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll definitely see my doctor more often,'' she said. But she
quickly added that she won't give up her sex life.
</P>
<P>
   A 19-year-old male intern from Arizona said the presentation was
illuminating. ``I didn't know about most of that stuff,'' he said,
adding that he'll think more about abstinence.

 By KATE MURPHY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Times were tough in 1994 at the Straus Family Creamery. ``The
price we were getting for our milk wasn't paying the cost of
production,'' said Vivien E. Straus, who struggled along with her
father and brother to keep their then 50-year-old farm in Marshall,
Calif., solvent.
</P>
<P>
   So they decided to go organic, and their fortunes turned up in a
hurry. Today, they are scrambling to satisfy booming demand for
premium-priced organic milk, cheese and butter.
</P>
<P>
   To consumers, ``organic'' means that the cows are not treated
with hormones or antibiotics and are given feed grown without
synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. To marketers, ``organic''
means money.
</P>
<P>
   From ice cream sandwiches to ricotta cheese, more organic dairy
products than ever are found in grocers' dairy cases, and not just
from small regional brands like Straus, whose sales last year
totaled $4 million. At least three specialist producers _ the
Horizon Organic Holding Corp., Organic Valley Cooperative and
Stonyfield Farm _ are distributing their products nationwide, and
bigger dairy producers are edging into the field. Sales of organic
milk products nearly doubled last year, according to the Organic
Trade Association in Greenfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Organic dairy products are still a small niche _ just 0.3
percent of the $75 billion American dairy market _ but the
predicted growth rate is phenomenal: Analysts say organics could
reach 2 percent by 2005, a nearly seven-fold increase. ``It's
booming,'' said Karen Raterman, editor of Natural Foods
Merchandiser, a publication that tracks organic and natural-food
sales.
</P>
<P>
   And the range of organic products has expanded from plain milk
and yogurt to include specialty items like jalapeno cheddar cheese
and chocolate chip ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Demand began to take off in 1993, after the Food and Drug
Administration approved the use of rBGH, a genetically engineered
hormone manufactured by Monsanto and marketed under the name
Prosilec. Cows treated with the hormone produce as much as 25
percent more milk daily.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups questioned the adequacy of safety studies, done
on rats, that were offered as proof that milk from hormone-treated
cows is safe for human consumption. Animal-rights activists say
cattle given the drug tend to get more udder infections than
untreated cows.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists worry that increased use of antibiotics to treat
the udder infections will promote antibiotic resistance in bacteria
that can infect humans. In January, the Canadian government
rejected the hormone on animal-safety grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA and Monsanto contend that use of the hormone is benign
for both cows and people. ``We review all new evidence as it comes
to light, and so far nothing has caused us to believe rBGH is a
hazard,'' said Dr. Stephen F. Sundlof, director of the agency's
center for veterinary medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But some consumers remain skeptical. ``There has been a lot of
switching'' from conventional to organic dairy products since the
approval of the hormone, said Jerry Dryer, a dairy industry
consultant in Chicago. ``People would rather be safe than sorry,''
he said, even if it may mean paying 50 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed of change in the industry has been staggering,''
said Gary Hirschberg, president of Stonyfield Farm in Londonderry,
N.H., which began selling organic yogurt in 1983. Before the FDA
approved the hormone treatment, Stonyfield's sales averaged $5
million a year, and product managers at mainstream grocery stores
``chuckled among themselves about these ex-hippies coming in,
trying to sell their yogurt,'' Hirschberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Kroger and Safeway are calling us saying, `Can you get us
some of that hormone-free yogurt?''' he said. Stonyfield's sales
exceeded $42 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Organic Valley, a 10-year-old cooperative in La Farge, Wis.,
that now has 135 member farms, has also seen sales rocket to eight
times what they were before the hormone was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Those gains are built partly on eye-catching advertising and
marketing, a departure for an industry that mostly advertises
collectively (the ``Got Milk?'' campaign is the latest) and treats
its main product as a commodity. Horizon Organic, the largest
organic dairy producer, with $49.4 million in sales, and the only
one publicly traded, uses polychromatic packaging showing a leaping
cartoon cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stand out in that boring field of white you see in the
dairy case,'' said Donna M. Berry, senior editor of Dairy Foods, an
industry trade publication. Horizon also advertises in magazines
like Parenting and on cable television programs like ``Healthy
Kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Based in Longmont, Colo., Horizon Organic expects to double its
sales next year, to $100 million, a growth trajectory that caught
the attention of the Dallas-based Suiza Foods, one of the nation's
largest dairy processors and distributors. Suiza bought a 12
percent stake in Horizon in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Suiza's biggest competitors, Dean Foods of Franklin Park, Ill.,
and General Mills of Minneapolis, are also jumping on the organic
bandwagon with acquisitions. (Dean bought Alta Dena Certified Dairy
of City of Industry, Calif., in May) or line extensions (two new
organic flavors of Yoplait yogurt). Analysts say these crossover
players will earn 30 percent to 40 percent higher profit margins on
their organic items.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkable how much consumers are willing to pay for
organic products,'' Ms. Berry said.

NATO POLICE HOLD 3 ALBANIAN SUSPECTS IN MASSACRE OF SERB FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ NATO police are holding three Albanians
as suspects in the July 23 murders of 14 Serb farmers from the
village of Gracko, and NATO has sent weapons, ammunition and
clothing to Britain for forensic analysis, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   House-to-house canvassing and raids followed the killings, said
Col. Ian Waters, provost marshal and chief of the military police
in Kosovo, and resulted in the arrests Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths raised concerns that NATO forces were failing to
provide security for the Serb minority in the crime-racked
province, and catching the culprits became a priority for NATO
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The three suspects have denied involvement in the murders and
add that they are not in the Kosovo Liberation Army, Waters said at
a news conference here. They were arrested in raids on houses in
villages in a six-mile radius of the murder scene, which was in the
fields and away from the village. The police are searching for
further suspects, the colonel said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims ``were caught by surprise,'' he reported, adding,
``Apparently they were in a group talking and chatting.''
</P>
<P>
   The murder victims died from gunshot wounds. One was holding a
cigarette between his fingers. Another had a gun in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a specific killing,'' the colonel said. ``The people
did what they were intending to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior investigating officer, Maj. John Woodbridge, said the
victims, who ranged from a teen-ager to an elderly man, were not
mutilated. Several were shot at close range, Woodbridge said, and
one was shot in the back three times as he sat on a tractor 150
yards from the others.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the NATO force in Kosovo, Gen. Michael Jackson,
spoke last week of the possibility of an organized terror campaign
by Albanians to push the remaining Serbs to leave. His comments and
the detention of the three Albanians have raised suspicions that
members of the the Kosovo Liberation Army may have been involved in
the deaths. But Waters said the motive was not known.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla leadership has condemned the killings and denied
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of surrounding villages speculated that the
killers were most likely ordinary people who were taking revenge
for the killings by Serbs in the Kosovo conflict. Every Albanian
village in the area has dug graves to bury war dead and has
accounts of random killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war ended, and a lot of Albanians are coming down from
hiding in the woods and think the world is theirs,'' said Gezim
Emini, 21, a shopkeeper in Hallaq, across the fields from Gracko.
``They have a gun in their hands for the first time, and they are
doing bad things.''

PHILIPS ACADEMY BIDS FAREWELL TO INSPIRATIONAL TEACHER OF HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDOVER, Mass. _ One of the rewards of teaching is the feedback
from students, delayed though it may be. ``Sometimes you get a
letter 15 or 20 years later,'' Thomas T. Lyons said as he reflected
on his 36 years of teaching history at Phillips Academy, one of the
nation's leading prep schools.
</P>
<P>
   Or 36 years later. When Lyons, 65, retired in June, he was
deluged by tributes from former students. One admiring two-page,
handwritten letter arrived from Texas, from a student Lyons had
taught in his first year here, George W. Bush (class of '64). About
the same time, Bush, the governor of Texas and front-running
contender for the Republican presidential nomination, did his
former teacher the mixed favor of taking him national, saying in a
television interview that Lyons ``was probably the most influential
teacher on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons says he was touched by the praise, but since receiving the
letter he has been avoiding reporters who want to talk about Bush,
with whom he has not spoken since graduation. (Lyons does say this:
``He was a nice guy whom everyone liked.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Lyons is a teacher, and his relationships with students are
private. Besides, as his students attest, there is so much else to
talk about, endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the campus July 26 to talk about teaching,
Lyons held forth exuberantly with barely a break, or segue, on his
beloved Supreme Court, which he has spent his life studying and
teaching about; its landmark Brown vs. Board of Education decision
in 1954 and a related case, Briggs vs. Elliott, the subject of the
last of his nine books; the first African-American history course
he taught, at Dartmouth College years ago; the vibrance of
Andover's diverse and co-ed student body, so different from the
all-male, overwhelmingly white prep school where he began his
career; the strength and goodness of his wife of 41 years, Eleanor,
and the book he has been reading this summer about polio, a disease
that struck him when he was a 20-year-old football player at Brown
University and left him unable to walk without crutches.
</P>
<P>
   It was, as his colleagues and students had made clear in their
farewell speeches and toasts, a fair reflection of his teaching
style, a relentless enthusiasm that could intimidate, overwhelm,
even daze, but that ultimately inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking U.S. history with Lyons was a bit like going over
Niagara Falls in a barrel,'' said Vic Henningsen, the chairman of
Phillips Academy's history department, in his tribute. ``You had to
struggle to stay afloat amid the torrents of information, but you
survived, you never forgot the ride, and you always thought it was
worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone like Lyons only adds to the mystery of what makes a
great teacher. Trying to succinctly explain Lyons' talent,
Henningsen said in his speech, was like ``pointing at one
intersection of rock and water on the Colorado River and saying,
`There you go, that explains the Grand Canyon.'''
</P>
<P>
   Year after year, the students who entered Room 13 in Samuel
Phillips Hall for American history, or the wildly popular,
hard-to-get-into senior seminar on constitutional law, encountered
a big man with silver hair and a booming voice who still had the
presence of the star athlete he was back at Reading High School, 15
miles and a world away from Phillips Academy.
</P>
<P>
   An hour into the morning, his shirt was invariably untucked and
ink stained, and the desks around him were strewn with copies of
the original historical documents he was forever digging up and
sharing with his classes. Living and breathing American history,
Lyons demanded intellectual rigor and a devotion not only to the
facts but also to the human beings _ both the presidents and the
common people _ who make history.
</P>
<P>
   His heroes included Eleanor Roosevelt; Jane Addams, a leader in
the women's suffrage and pacifist movements and co-founder of one
of the nation's first social settlements; Eugene Debs, the labor
leader and a socialist candidate for president; Supreme Court
Justice William Brennan and John Lewis, a hero of the civil rights
movement and Democratic congressman from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling Lyons in the classroom, Dr. Charles van der Horst,
class of '70, who is a professor of medicine at the University of
North Carolina and a leading AIDS researcher, said: ``He stands up
and he's waving those long silver crutches, and banging them on the
table. You didn't dare fall asleep. And he knew everything. He
would wander around, smacking the table, smacking you and getting
you to think. It was the most exciting class I've ever taken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was American history through original source documents _
eyewitness accounts of the Haymarket riots, original Supreme Court
decisions,'' van der Horst added. ``We didn't do little synopses of
Madison vs. Marbury, we read the decision. It was like we were
there.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, a Harvard graduate, was chairman of the academy's history
department for five years, but he was not interested in
administration. He loved teaching and he loved teen-agers _ ``that
least lovable of subspecies,'' said David Cohen, class of '70, who
is assistant director of education for the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an endless parade of kids through his house,'' said
Cohen, who was among them. ``His enthusiasm extends to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a journalist _ his father, Louis Lyons, was a
reporter for The Boston Globe and a longtime curator of the Nieman
Foundation for Journalism at Harvard _ Lyons began each year by
conducting long personal interviews with each student in his class.
</P>
<P>
   Henningsen recalled in his farewell: ``Fall afternoons are
likely to find Lyons deep in conversation with a student, saying
something like, `Your dad's a millworker? Tell me a bit about
that.''' (And if there are more millworkers' sons, and more blacks,
Latinos and Asians than there were in the old Andover, then it is
due in part to the efforts of reformers like Lyons.)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as a junior, Julie Stephens took Lyons' American
history class, and her life was changed. ``It's the level of
intensity,'' she said. In the spring Ms. Stephens, who is from
Arlington, Va., discovered just how intense Lyons could be when she
wrote a long paper for class. Her subject: how race and urban
politics had shaped the subway system in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   `` Lyons must have invested 20 hours in me just on that paper,''
Ms. Stephens said. ``When I got back my first rough draft and read
his comments, I burst into tears. He said: `Don't worry, I'm trying
to push you. You have to get the human element. I don't want to
read two pages with statistics and bureaucratic stuff. Find people
who are interesting and tell the story through them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Multiple drafts followed. On the Sunday before the paper was
due, Lyons showed up at her dormitory to read the final draft. In
the end, he gave her paper the highest possible grade, and
submitted it for a prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt like Lyons believed in me more than I did
myself,'' Ms. Stephens said.
</P>
<P>
   For all his loquaciousness, one thing Lyons is reticent about is
the constant pain he lives with, with complications from a ruptured
disk in his spine, as well as continuing problems with his legs.
</P>
<P>
   As the junior varsity football coach years ago, he would race up
and down the sidelines on his crutches. Eleven years ago,
reluctantly, he began to use a wheelchair to get around campus,
although he still walks with crutches as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   What is there to complain about, Lyons asked, adding: ``You only
walk and run on your legs. You live with your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   He was talking as he revisited his old classroom, with its large
windows overlooking the leafy campus, and its empty desks that will
be occupied by new students, and a different teacher, next fall.
``Sometimes you have a crummy night, and you wake up and you don't
feel too good,'' he said. ``But you have to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing a teacher can be is dull,'' he continued. ``I
talk too much, probably. I get all pumped up, and by five past
eight I'm flying. You sort of forget some of the aches and pains.''

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LAWYER OF LEBANESE DESCENT NAMED TO TERRORISM
PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Justice Department civil rights lawyer, an Arab-American, has
been named to serve on a national commission on terrorism as a
replacement for a Muslim-American whose nomination was withdrawn
under pressure from Jewish organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority
leader, withdrew the nomination of the Muslim, Salam Al-Marayati,
executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los
Angeles, after an outcry from Jewish leaders who accused
Al-Marayati of condoning terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-member group has been given six months to review national
policy on preventing and punishing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt maintained that he removed Al-Marayati from the
commission only because it would take too long to get him a
security clearance. But Al-Marayati pointed out that he had already
gone through security checks to visit the White House, fly on Air
Force II, and because his wife serves on a State Department
commission.
</P>
<P>
   The new nominee, Juliette N. Kayyem, already had a security
clearance. She has served as counsel in the office of the assistant
attorney general for civil rights. There she developed policies
that would ensure that airport antiterrorism measures did not
unjustly focus on _ or ``profile'' _ Arabs and Muslims. She also
reviewed Immigration and Naturalization Service policy on using
classified information in deportation proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, said,
``She understands the disparate impact that some of this
anti-terrorism legislation has had on Arabs and Muslims in this
country. She understands when biases become bad policy. I think
she's going to make an important contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think that Salam was a remarkable choice and are very
disappointed in the way this was handled,'' Zogby said, ``but we
feel that Juliette is a very competent attorney with sound
perspective on civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kayyem, 29, who grew up in Los Angeles, is of Lebanese
Christian descent. She is married to a Jewish lawyer who recently
became a professor at Harvard Law School, and the two had just
moved to Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kayyem said, ``My experience in civil rights and profiling
and security issues is what brought other people's attention to me
for this commission, and no one group endorsed it, or said it was
OK, or she'll pass. I don't think that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewish groups opposed Al-Marayati because of statements he or
his associates had made that blamed Israel for inciting
Palestinians to terrorism and condoned actions against Israeli
troops in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic
Relations, said of Ms. Kayyem's appointment, ``We have nothing
against her personally, but we're disappointed that the commission
won't have a Muslim representative. This leaves the issue of Muslim
exclusion from the political process unresolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Marayati and Ms. Kayyem spoke together by telephone Friday.
He congratulated her and said he would be glad to cooperate with
the commission, and she asked for his input.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Marayati also has asked Gephardt to address the lack of
Muslim-American perspective in public policy. Gephardt responded in
a letter that he and Rep. David Bonior would establish ``a forum''
where political leaders can ``discuss key issues'' with Muslim
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unsettled issue,'' Al-Marayati said, ``is that we have to
focus on the selection process and ensure there are no litmus tests
in the future on any candidates for government commissions.''

<P>
   LONDON _ With the world's stock exchanges increasingly
challenged by upstart electronic trading networks, the august
London Stock Exchange on Friday announced plans to end almost two
centuries of clubby mutual ownership by issuing tradeable shares to
its members.
</P>
<P>
   The move, depicted by the exchange as part of a quest for a new
corporate agility, is similar to steps announced by the New York
Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market, which face even greater
threats than European exchanges from electronic communications
networks, known by their initials ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement by the London exchange, which claims to be
the world's oldest, raised questions about the future of stalled
efforts led by the London and Frankfurt exchanges to create a
pan-European stock exchange from eight existing institutions. The
year-old negotiations have come to a halt amid disputes over
ownership and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some bankers said that rapid technological advances
facilitating smaller, cheaper and more nimble electronic trading
platforms could eclipse the more staid, traditional exchanges by
creating pan-European networks of their own. ``If the major
exchanges don't move quickly enough, the ECNs will,'' said Ronald
Cohen, chairman of Apax Partners &AMP; Co., a private equity company
with minority stakes in two electronic trading outfits _ the
Tradepoint alternative stock exchange in Britain, and Easdaq, a
pan-European market for high-growth stocks that plans to list its
stock on Nasdaq in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The planned changes at the London Stock Exchange, which need
approval from 75 percent of its 294 members, represent the biggest
shift in the way the organization is run since the so-called Big
Bang of 1986 when it moved away from the floor trading system still
used at the New York Stock Exchange to screen-based trading.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Muncer, a spokesman for the London Stock Exchange, said the
detailed workings of the new system still had to be formulated and
he indicated that London exchange officials were not at present
contemplating the same full public stock offering as the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the move was designed to give the London Stock
Exchange more flexibility in raising capital for new, competitive
ventures and in accelerating decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Gavin Casey, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange,
said that ``greater speed and flexibility than ever before'' were
needed ``for London to stay ahead in today's technology-driven
market-place.''
</P>
<P>
   Some American investment firms with big trading operations here
welcomed the move. Tom Troy, head of European equities at Merrill
Lynch, said the firm was ``very supportive of its
demutualization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Market structures globally are evolving quickly,'' he added,
``and the London Stock Exchange's move to further modernize itself
will provide it with the commercial edge needed to compete in the
new order.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the quandary facing the London exchange was part of a
much broader contest between the established national exchanges and
the technology that is reshaping the international marketplace for
stocks. ``This isn't a phenomenon of just the London Stock Exchange
or the City of London,'' he said. ``This is a global phenomenon
that's affecting all the major exchanges around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, for instance, 30 percent of trades in
companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange are done through electronic
communication networks. Around 15 percent of all trades are done in
on-line trading. The European figures are far less but growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'll see the volume of day-trading and retail
in quite the way as in the U.S.,'' said Richard Kilsby, chief
executive of the Tradepoint exchange, which was recently
recapitalized by a consortium of United States and other investment
banks and institutions. ``But I do think there's great latent
demand and volume for European stocks. It's not just around the
corner. But it's not far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Thursday, 19 institutions here including Barclays Global
Investors Ltd. and Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management,
announced plans to create a European trading network called
E-Crossnet Ltd., designed to undercut existing transaction costs.
In the United States last week, the Charles Schwab Corp. on and
Fidelity Investments, the leading mutual funds investment company,
started an electronic network with two other companies, reflecting
the boom in retail, on-line trading that has helped fuel Wall
Street's bull run.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the traditional exchanges are challenged by such
institutions as the Instinet Corp., owned by Reuters Group PLC, and
Tradebook, owned by Bloomberg LP.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid expansion of electronic trading contrasts sharply with
the ponderous negotiations to fuse Europe's existing stock
exchanges into a single system, a move initially inspired by the
approach of the euro single currency, which was introduced in 11
European countries last January.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between the London Stock Exchange and Frankfurt's
Deutsche Borse, which have made progress in such areas as
harmonized working hours, are close to deadlock on several other
issues, people close to those discussions said. The two exchanges,
these people said, have failed to agree on a common trading
technology.
</P>
<P>
   That has inspired sentiment that the discussions will be
overtaken by technologically driven market forces. ``If London and
Frankfurt, in a very timely manner, are not able to come up with a
credible structure then I think the alternative trading systems
will do that,'' said Troy at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The disarray among the European exchanges is accentuated by wide
differences in their ownership structures. Of all eight, for
instance, only Sweden's Stock Exchange is owned by a traded company
_ OM Gruppen AB. Others, such as the Frankfurt and Zurich exchanges
are dominated by German and Swiss banks and have said they have no
plans to go public. The Amsterdam exchange demutualized in 1997 and
plans to issue shares by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's move by the London exchange, however, raised
speculation that all will come under pressure to change along the
same lines. The exchanges, said Cohen of Apax Partners, ``find it
difficult to go beyond national borders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are symbols of national pride and don't operate like a
normal company,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But, after Friday's development, he said, ``my guess is that
this will start a chain reaction of all European exchanges
demutualizing, moving away from politics and into business.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS EXPRESSES CONCERNS ABOUT ONLINE PHARMACIES
 &HT;    By JONATHAN HALL
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A congressional panel on Friday heard warnings that
patients may be at risk when they order prescription drugs from
online pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, lawmakers were told at a hearing, there is no law
that requires a drug-dispensing Web site to post information about
itself. Consumers often are unaware whether the online pharmacies
use the services of physicians or licensed druggists, or whether
they accurately dispense medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these sites operate for a short period of time at one
Web site address before disappearing and showing up under another
name, making it difficult for anyone to track them down,'' said
Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the House subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations. ``Among the concerns is the product
quality of these drugs and whether patients may be at risk of
serious and even fatal drug reactions due to lack of oversight from
a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee staff has identified nearly 200 Web sites, many
of which operate from abroad, that sell drugs from ranging from
Viagra and Propecia to potentially addictive pain killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that a wild West world is unfolding, where many
consumers are accessing potentially dangerous drugs with little or
no practical guidance,'' said Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The panel listened to testimony from two television reporters _
one from Pennsylvania, the other from Michigan _ who told of
investigative stories they had aired about online pharmacies. Both
described the ease with which they were able to order prescription
drugs over the Internet. In one case, a reporter ordered the
anti-impotency drug Viagra by filling out an ``online
consultation'' on behalf of his cat, Tom. Despite correctly listing
the cat's weight and height, the online pharmacy did not raise any
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My constituents _ and frankly all U.S. citizens _ deserve the
same level of protections with an online site that they have with a
corner drug store. Nothing more, nothing less,'' Klink said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association announced Friday that there is
``an urgent need to establish medical safeguards to restrict these
dangerous Internet prescribing practices.''
</P>
<P>
   The AMA recommends that in prescribing drugs:
</P>
<P>
   _ A physician should have reliable patient medical history
available.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dialogue must take place between the physician and patient
during treatment.
</P>
<P>
   _ The physician should inform the patient about risks and
benefits of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   _ A physician should have appropriate follow-up to the patient's
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, the Federal Trade Commission urged Congress to
require Internet sites that sell prescription drugs to disclose
more information about their businesses and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said the sites should contain the name, address and
phone number of the pharmacy that will dispense the drugs and where
that pharmacy is licensed to do business. Similar information
should be provided about physicians who prescribe drugs over the
Internet _ often after an online ``consultation'' with a consumer _
as well as the states where that physician is licensed or
authorized to practice medicine.
</P>
<P>
   There should also be information about any Internet operator _
separate from the doctor or pharmacy _ that is offering the drugs
for sale, including the principal owners of the business.
</P>
<P>
   The site should tell consumers the states from which it will
accept orders, the FTC urged.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was mid-June, and so Virginia Parks, a teaching
assistant in the geography department at the University of
California at Los Angeles, was singing the usual end-of-semester
blues. She had to grade roughly 80 final exams, each of them 8 to
10 pages, for a course on race and employment in cities.
</P>
<P>
   To earn extra money, she was also helping with a biogeography
class, and had to grade final exams for some of its 100
undergraduates, as well as a handful of their final presentations.
</P>
<P>
   For both courses, Ms. Parks is paid about $1,700 a month.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heavy burden, but those were just half of her
responsibilities; in addition, Ms. Parks is working on her Ph.D.
The day before administering the first of the undergraduate exams,
she had to take her own final in statistics. And days after grading
the last of the undergraduate exams, she would have to sit for a
grueling week of what are known as qualifying exams, the last step
before beginning a thesis. She had four hours of written exams on a
Monday, eight hours on Tuesday, four more on Wednesday, and then a
48-hour endurance test of an exam in which she had to research and
write a 30-page paper outlining a thesis plan for a hypothetical
topic that would be given to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little bit freaked,'' said Ms. Parks, 28, sounding
surprisingly cheerful nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Graduate student life has always been, to put it mildly, a time
of sacrifice. But that is part of the strategy: students are
regarded as apprentices, both scholars and educators in the making,
with tenured faculty wielding considerable power over their
futures. Teaching is seen as part of the training for a life in the
Academy. The modest wages are considered almost a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Parks and her fellow teaching assistants, or TAs, have
rejected this traditional academic model.
</P>
<P>
   In a shift that could have subtle yet far-reaching implications,
the teaching assistants at the University of California _ one of
the largest state university complexes in the country, with 170,000
graduate and undergraduate students on nine campuses _ elected this
spring to form unions to demand better conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these students, teaching is a job,'' said Elizabeth Bunn,
a vice president of the United Automobile Workers in Detroit who
has been overseeing TA unionization efforts. ``We've never accepted
the argument that there is a difference between the university and
other kinds of workplaces when the issue is work. The workers are
not asking to be paid for their work as students. They are asking
to be paid fairly when they work as employees of the
universities.''
</P>
<P>
   The California campuses are by far the biggest prize in a
movement that has been slowly gaining momentum around the country
for years. Twelve campuses, including three at the State University
of New York, had TA unions three years ago, according to the
AFL-CIO. Today, there are 23 unionized campuses, with serious
movements under way at institutions like Yale, Temple, Oregon State
and New York University.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only students at public universities, which are governed
by state labor laws rather than federal law, have succeeded in
forming unions, after being recognized as public employees.
</P>
<P>
   Unions hope the next breakthrough will be at a private
university. The National Labor Relations Board is considering a
case filed on behalf of New york University graduate students. If
the board decides that, under federal law, the TAs are employees
rather than students, it would open the way for a union vote in the
next academic year at NYU. It would also reverse a 25-year-old
interpretation of the law and enable union elections at other
private institutions.
</P>
<P>
   This shift is part of a broader change in university
instruction. Over the last several decades, tenured or tenure-track
faculty members have been teaching an ever-shrinking proportion of
undergraduate classes. The number of part-time faculty and teaching
assistants has increased to 47 percent in 1995 from 22 percent in
the mid-1970s, according to the Department of Education. The change
was motivated largely by the need to reduce costs, said Cary
Nelson, a professor at the University of Illinois who has written
extensively on this shift.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, most universities are prospering in a robust
economy, but the trend of relying on low-paid part-timers and TAs
is still growing, surprising researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected that when the financial situation improved it
would go away,'' said Dr. Jay Chronister, a professor of education
at the University of Virginia and co-author of a recent study on
this trend in teaching responsibilities. ``That has not been the
case at most institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason, Chronister said, is fear that graduate enrollment
would drop if TA positions were cut back. Also, some universities
want full professors focusing on scholarship and research. ``We
assess the quality of a faculty member, correctly or incorrectly,
through the quality of publications and grants they can bring in,''
said Chronister. ``We don't build our national reputation on
teaching.''

</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parks met with her six biogeography students in a classroom
off a palm-shaded courtyard. One by one they stood and, somewhat
nervously, gave presentations they had been assigned weeks earlier.
Each had been asked to critique an academic article assessing the
effects of development on various environments, from a national
park in Africa to a reef off South America.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parks _ slight, energetic, with a droll sense of humor _
stretched out in a chair, a battered pair of eyeglasses sliding
down her nose. She listened patiently and asked questions to
stimulate discussion and draw out the students. After class, with
union organizing posters as backdrop and a bare table as a desk,
she spent an hour in the office she shares with other TAs, making
herself available to any student who strolled in, as she is obliged
to do.
</P>
<P>
   The biogeography class had been particularly time consuming, she
said, because it was outside her area of concentration, economic
geography. For instance, she needed to study the six articles she
had assigned the students, and regularly put in far more than the
20 hours a week the university sets as a guideline for TA work.
</P>
<P>
   Her real interest is economic development in the inner city _
social justice, as she puts it _ which is why she got a master's
degree in urban planning before embarking on a Ph.D. With
tenure-track positions much sought after and in short supply, she
said she is leaving open the possibility that she might end up
working for a think tank or nonprofit foundation after completing
her studies.
</P>
<P>
   She is convinced that one of the greatest obstacles to achieving
her goals is the teaching. But it is essential because she needs
the income. ``What's falling behind is my own research,'' Ms. Parks
said. She has had to delay for more than a year a paper on changing
patterns of immigrant labor within cities because she cannot find
the time. ``I would catch up over the summer, but I have to find a
job and work over the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some students who oppose the aggressive unionization
efforts agree that teaching can prolong graduate studies and make
it a more trying experience.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Young, a graduate student in geology, said she had lost
about a year in her studies because of her teaching load. But she
worries that undergraduates will suffer if TAs limit their work
hours, one of the union's main goals. ``It wouldn't be possible to
do a good job on just 20 hours a week,'' Ms. Young said. ``I would
feel like I was gypping the students if I didn't put more time into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, tenured professors say they do not monitor the
hours that TAs put in, but do expect competent and full work in the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's sort of `Don't ask, don't tell,' '' said Mark
Ellis, Ms. Parks's adviser in the geography department and a
supporter of the union cause.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Savage, the professor with overall responsibility for
the biogeography course that Ms. Parks was helping with, calls the
system archaic. ``At one time, graduate students were really
captives of the faculty,'' she said. ``They had to do a great many
things for nothing. That sort of thing is frowned on now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities are increasingly like the corporate world,''
Professor Savage added. ``The perception of the university as a
protected place, as a place set aside from the hurly-burly of life,
is no longer true.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, university administrators disagree. They say
their greatest concern is that unionization would upset the
traditional, informal relationship between student and professor on
which graduate education has long depended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, the concern for me is the possible establishment of an
adversarial relationship of two groups who should be involved in
nurturing and mentoring relationships,'' said Dr. Claudia
Mitchell-Kernan, UCLA's dean of graduate studies. ``We have felt
that the teaching experience was part of the education, and we
continue to feel that the educational component of the TA-ship is
primary, particularly for those preparing to go on to academic
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really the question,'' she said. ``Where the balance
lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Berne, NYU's vice president for academic development, who
has been the point man in the battle against unionization on that
campus, said the university's resistance has little to do with
finances. Instead, he said, the issue is flexibility and the role
of the professor as mentor, guide and sometimes colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are students and the activities associated with a union
would harm that,'' Berne said. ``The fundamental academic
enterprise would be negatively affected in a number of different
ways. The work in graduate school is really individual and it
depends on a relationship with professors that the union would
homogenize.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Young, the geology student, believes unionization would be a
violation of a code of honor. ``By joining the union,'' she said,
``I feel like I'd be slapping the department in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the organization behind the union drive at UCLA,
the Student Association of Graduate Employees, or SAGE, called a
strike for semester's end, the busiest time. Some TAs broke ranks
and taught their courses anyway. Some held classes off campus.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parks chose not to go to class or grade any papers. She
described it as a difficult but necessary step.
</P>
<P>
   ``You heard a lot of people saying, `Oh, we're so dedicated.
This isn't really work. It's this higher calling,' '' she said. ``I
am totally committed to it, but it's a job. I just felt we really
had to stick with it. I believed the action meant totally
withholding our labor.''
</P>
<P>
   The action lasted four days, with the state Legislature stepping
in and calling for a cooling-off period. The university docked the
strikers' pay for the days missed, including Ms. Parks' wages. Ms.
Parks objected, because the work she would have done was merely put
aside for her to do when she returned. With the support of her
department, she was ultimately given full pay.
</P>
<P>
   The strike, though short-lived, underscored for many people how
strong the movement had become. It had taken 15 years to get that
far.
</P>
<P>
   The unionization drive in California began in 1983 at Berkeley.
Four years later it became affiliated with the UAW, which had been
trying to organize white-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-day strike in 1989, the organization began
collective bargaining with the administration. It won two benefits
for teaching assistants: a partial remission of graduate student
fees and paid health care, excluding eye and dental care.

   She is convinced that one of the greatest obstacles to achieving
her goals is the teaching. But it is essential because she needs
the income. ``What's falling behind is my own research,'' Ms. Parks
said. She has had to delay for more than a year a paper on changing
patterns of immigrant labor within cities because she cannot find
the time. ``I would catch up over the summer, but I have to find a
job and work over the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some students who oppose the aggressive unionization
efforts agree that teaching can prolong graduate studies and make
it a more trying experience.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Young, a graduate student in geology, said she had lost
about a year in her studies because of her teaching load. But she
worries that undergraduates will suffer if TAs limit their work
hours, one of the union's main goals. ``It wouldn't be possible to
do a good job on just 20 hours a week,'' Ms. Young said. ``I would
feel like I was gypping the students if I didn't put more time into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, tenured professors say they do not monitor the
hours that TAs put in, but do expect competent and full work in the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's sort of `Don't ask, don't tell,' '' said Mark
Ellis, Ms. Parks's adviser in the geography department and a
supporter of the union cause.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Savage, the professor with overall responsibility for
the biogeography course that Ms. Parks was helping with, calls the
system archaic. ``At one time, graduate students were really
captives of the faculty,'' she said. ``They had to do a great many
things for nothing. That sort of thing is frowned on now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities are increasingly like the corporate world,''
Professor Savage added. ``The perception of the university as a
protected place, as a place set aside from the hurly-burly of life,
is no longer true.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, university administrators disagree. They say
their greatest concern is that unionization would upset the
traditional, informal relationship between student and professor on
which graduate education has long depended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, the concern for me is the possible establishment of an
adversarial relationship of two groups who should be involved in
nurturing and mentoring relationships,'' said Dr. Claudia
Mitchell-Kernan, UCLA's dean of graduate studies. ``We have felt
that the teaching experience was part of the education, and we
continue to feel that the educational component of the TA-ship is
primary, particularly for those preparing to go on to academic
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really the question,'' she said. ``Where the balance
lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Berne, NYU's vice president for academic development, who
has been the point man in the battle against unionization on that
campus, said the university's resistance has little to do with
finances. Instead, he said, the issue is flexibility and the role
of the professor as mentor, guide and sometimes colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are students and the activities associated with a union
would harm that,'' Berne said. ``The fundamental academic
enterprise would be negatively affected in a number of different
ways. The work in graduate school is really individual and it
depends on a relationship with professors that the union would
homogenize.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Young, the geology student, believes unionization would be a
violation of a code of honor. ``By joining the union,'' she said,
``I feel like I'd be slapping the department in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the organization behind the union drive at UCLA,
the Student Association of Graduate Employees, or SAGE, called a
strike for semester's end, the busiest time. Some TAs broke ranks
and taught their courses anyway. Some held classes off campus.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parks chose not to go to class or grade any papers. She
described it as a difficult but necessary step.
</P>
<P>
   ``You heard a lot of people saying, `Oh, we're so dedicated.
This isn't really work. It's this higher calling,' '' she said. ``I
am totally committed to it, but it's a job. I just felt we really
had to stick with it. I believed the action meant totally
withholding our labor.''
</P>
<P>
   The action lasted four days, with the state Legislature stepping
in and calling for a cooling-off period. The university docked the
strikers' pay for the days missed, including Ms. Parks' wages. Ms.
Parks objected, because the work she would have done was merely put
aside for her to do when she returned. With the support of her
department, she was ultimately given full pay.
</P>
<P>
   The strike, though short-lived, underscored for many people how
strong the movement had become. It had taken 15 years to get that
far.
</P>
<P>
   The unionization drive in California began in 1983 at Berkeley.
Four years later it became affiliated with the UAW, which had been
trying to organize white-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-day strike in 1989, the organization began
collective bargaining with the administration. It won two benefits
for teaching assistants: a partial remission of graduate student
fees and paid health care, excluding eye and dental care.

 LOS ANGELES: dental care. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest break came last December, after years of litigation,
when UCLA's SAGE chapter won a ruling by California's Public
Employment Relations Board that declared teaching assistants were
state employees, not just students.
</P>
<P>
   A vote was ordered to determine if the TAs wanted to be
represented by the union. The union won the vote at UCLA in March,
followed a month later by Berkeley and then the remaining campuses.
A total of 68 percent who voted were in favor.
</P>
<P>
   Among the priorities are limiting work hours to 20 hours a week
(an unlikely prospect, all agree) or getting paid for time put in;
extending health insurance to include dental care and eyewear;
seeking a full remission of fees (they currently get 60 percent of
about $5,000 a year) and improving the grievance process so that
graduate students do not find their academic standing jeopardized
if they complain about abusive conditions or harassment on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is not going to make graduate student life
idyllic,'' said Ricardo Ochoa, a law student and president of the
Association of Graduate Student Employees at Berkeley. ``But it has
the potential for easing some of the pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Students expect their lives to remain a constant balancing act.
Ms. Parks receives no financial assistance from her family. She and
her boyfriend, also a graduate student in geography, share the $550
rent on a small one-bedroom apartment in Venice. It is about seven
and a half miles from the UCLA campus, and Ms. Parks, a former
bicycle racer on the UCLA team, pedals her old bike to school most
days.
</P>
<P>
   Existence is Spartan, with a meal out a rarity. She and her
boyfriend go to movie matinees because they are a few dollars
cheaper, and they rarely socialize in bars or other venues that
cost money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you where all the free things are in L.A.,'' Ms.
Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   She is relatively sanguine about her financial restrictions, but
the issue is a sore one for many students tired of the economic
sacrifices. ``I feel like I should be a grown-up by now, with a car
that doesn't always break down,'' said Elizabeth Schirmer, 28, who
is working on her Ph.D. in English at Berkeley. ``It gets old.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching assistants are buffeted by several high-pressure
cross-currents.
</P>
<P>
   Grievances against professors, for instance, have the potential
for wrecking academic careers, graduate students say. As it stands,
complaints must be taken to the chairman of the department
involved. There is no neutral third party to hear them.
</P>
<P>
   It is a little discussed subject, but anecdotes circulate about
graduate students who have faced some form of retribution after
complaining about a professor _ a poor letter of recommendation or
a refusal to transfer a graduate student to a different adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could damage the position of a student and employment
prospects,'' Ms. Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda Janzen, a poet who is getting her Ph.D. in English at
UCLA, agrees. ``The tenured professor has an unusual and even a
dangerous amount of power,'' she said. ``It's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching assistants also face pressure in grading
undergraduates. On the one hand, if the grading is not tough, it
can harm the TA's reputation as well as the professor's, Ms. Parks
said. Yet tough grading can be even more hazardous. Undergraduates,
increasingly worried about getting into professional schools, have
grown more aggressive in challenging teachers about grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a tough grader you have to be willing to put in more
time explaining better what you did, giving students more time to
do their work,'' Ms. Parks said. ``You're sort of betwixt and
between.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure ``isn't subtle, it's overt,'' Ms. Janzen said. She
was once threatened with a lawsuit by a student to whom she had
given a B. In general, professors back them up in disputes, Ms.
Janzen said, but it's important to be careful not to embarrass
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to tiptoe around the tenured professors as well as
the students,'' Ms. Janzen said.
</P>
<P>
   But undergraduate students face a similar situation with their
teaching assistants. Ms. Parks recently wrote a recommendation for
a student who was seeking to transfer to Stanford. The letter made
her realize the responsibility and power she had.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, I'm the one who knows the student,'' Ms. Parks
said. ``I'm the one writing the letter of recommendation, and
there's no recognition in the system for the role we play.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The practice space for the Mock Trial team of
Bushwick High School in Brooklyn is a storeroom for pen-scarred
desks and ruined textbooks. Paint-caked rollers and pans sit on
out-of-commission lockers. The one gesture toward a simulated
courtroom is the makeshift podium of 2-by-4's and fake pine
paneling.
</P>
<P>
   The team itself, on paper, doesn't stand a chance in the
upper-level competitions of Mock Trial, an extracurricular contest
of staged courtroom drama that attracts overachievers from suburban
schools and private academies _ the usual development grounds for
future juris doctors. At Bushwick, a teacher correcting a team
member's pronunciation was waved away with a ``Keep your panties
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect isn't high among these kids' values,'' said Mary
O'Donoghue, a prosecutor with the U.S. attorney's office in
Brooklyn who began coaching the team last year with Deon Gordon
Mitchell, a history teacher and former Mock Trial participant.
``They can be pretty mouthy, and they don't draw much of a line
between street life and school life.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it was removed from the state's list of failing schools
last November, Bushwick still ranks academically among the worst
high schools in the city. Nonetheless, in less than an hour on this
spring day, the team will begin the quarterfinal round of the New
York City championships against Abraham Lincoln High School, a
school of solid reputation with a far more experienced team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't like our Latina fla-vah, Miss,'' said Nancy
Ortiz-Gonzalez, a senior who will be defense attorney in the day's
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Donoghue tapped her watch, laughter subsided and the
students silently returned to their case notes. The two squads will
try the case of a fictional father, Brandon Berry, charged with
endangering the welfare of a child after his young son nearly died
in a fire as his wife slept, alcohol on her breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get that closing done, Nancy,'' Ms. O'Donoghue said.
``Tell me what your heart says.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy, who has been married since her sophomore year, fiddled
with her wedding ring and the good-luck Beanie Baby on her key
ring. The daughter of a construction laborer and a sewing-factory
worker, she was born on a farm in Puerto Rico and learned English
in school. She occasionally confuses her two languages, and needs
reminders to say ``both,'' not ``bof,'' and ``possession,'' not
``persession.''
</P>
<P>
   With almost every member of the Bushwick team no more than a
parent away from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica,
Vietnam, China or Africa, a typical practice is a jambalaya of
accents and idioms. Many of the students will be the first in their
families to graduate from high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to show that this wasn't a case of neglect, but it
was really June Berry's first step on a journey to a better life,''
Nancy said. ``This case is about people not understanding what it
is really like to be poor and to be a recovering alcoholic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' Ms. O'Donoghue encouraged. ``Let 'em have
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, schools with poor academic achievement
have consistently risen through the championship ranks of Mock
Trial. Bushwick has survived elimination rounds against teams
ranked far higher. In Manhattan, the team to beat is Louis D.
Brandeis High School, which has nearly as many dropouts as
graduates. Philadelphia's inner-city schools have finished first or
second in the last three Pennsylvania state championships, beating
elite suburban schools like Devon Prep and nine-time champion
Quigley Catholic from Pittsburgh. They've become so daunting that
competitors have begun talking of a Philly Factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inner-city kids have been putting on a regular magic show
the last couple of years,'' said John C. Shipley, author of the
authoritative ``Mock Trial Handbook'' and coach of the 1998
national champion, Cherry Hill East High School, in New Jersey.
``Schools you never heard of in the past, except maybe for gang
problems or poor academics, are suddenly taking the competitions by
storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Mock Trial, organized by each state's bar association, began two
decades ago as a law-inspired spinoff of team debate. In the last
three years, the associations have been pushing the program hard;
the New York bar wants a practicing lawyer volunteering in every
high school in the state.
</P>
<P>
   It works like this: Schools are given a fictional case file,
complete with witness statements and arrest records. From that,
students work with coaches to explore the pertinent legal
principles, like search and seizure and Miranda rights, and devise
strategies for both a defense and a prosecution. Teams then try the
case against each other, while a lawyer sits in as the judge.
During the trial, students question their own mock witnesses as
well as the opposition's; improvisation is welcome as long as no
one strays from the depositions' facts. Points are awarded on a
one-to-three scale for adherence to time limits and case material.
</P>
<P>
   The national championship, held this year in St. Louis in May
and won by Clarke Central High School of Athens, Ga., regularly
draws teams from at least 48 states and two territories. New York
is an annual absentee. From fewer than 300 participating schools in
the 1980s, the state now has more than 500. With so many teams, New
York has never been able to complete its championship in time to
send the winner to the nationals.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, showmanship was frowned upon; a tone of
parliamentary decorum was expected. But those tame courtroom
simulations have evolved into hotly contested trials that resemble
improv theater, with rapid-fire objections and ``Ally
McBeal''-style pyrotechnics. Coaches have begun scouting other
school activities to recruit thespians and musicians or simply any
student with a combination of flamboyance and critical thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no comparison between then and now,'' said Debra
Lesser, coordinator of the New York City competitions. Like other
Mock Trial observers, she's found that ``students are sharper, more
nimble on their feet, more in command of rules and strategy and
presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To be successful at Mock Trial, which involves the same kind of
stress control and brainpower as chess, a student has to role-play,
craft questions, deal with hecklers (objecting lawyers, in this
case), memorize hundreds of details of evidence and know the legal
concepts dead cold. ``Nowadays, if you lose focus for a minute,''
Shipley said, ``you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   What's most surprising is the kind of students being drawn to
the activity. ``If you go by statistics, these are the kinds of
kids who should be having trouble with the law, not enjoying it,''
said Davorka Grgas, the coach for Brandeis. The star of her team is
Jose Tuma, 18, who sports a pencil-thin mustache, thickly gelled
curls and construction boots with dangling laces. Raised by
Spanish-speaking grandparents after his sickly mother returned to
Puerto Rico and his father was put behind bars for drug dealing, he
spent most of his preteen weekends traveling to prisons in
Connecticut and New Jersey to visit his father, who was deported
during Jose's sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   Jose had mediocre grades and chronic disciplinary problems until
Ms. Grgas, impressed by his wit and sensing his intelligence,
auditioned him for her team. In his first year, Brandeis finished
sixth in the city. In his second season, after a match-winning
performance against Bronx Science High School, the judge pulled him
aside to urge him on to law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law is very much a part of these students' lives,'' said Ms.
Grgas. ``Some have been in legal trouble themselves; many others
have been stopped, questioned or scrutinized by police in their
neighborhoods. In our school, most kids feel a tremendous amount of
anger for the police. They see the legal system as a scary,
oppressive force, and they're eager for anything which gives them a
sense of control over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose psyches himself for tough matches by visualizing the night
he was awakened by flashing lights and looked out his bedroom
window to see his father wrestled across the hood of a police car.
When asked what he hoped to gain from Mock Trial, he instantly
answered, ``If my dad had a chance to get a good attorney, he'd be
here with me now. That's my motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it dramatizes social roles and issues like justice and
police authority, Mock Trial seems to affect inner-city students
like few other school activities do.
</P>
<P>
   Mia Roberts is a member of the team at Masterman High School in
North Philadelphia. This past fall, her 11-year-old cousin, Orlando
Rosario, disappeared on the way home from school. The family was
frantic. The police paid little attention, says Mia, and treated
the case as if Orlando were just another Latino runaway. When the
boy was discovered raped and murdered, and a recently paroled sex
offender was arrested for the crime, Mia quit the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why was that guy still on the street?'' she asked angrily in
an unusually quiet moment in the classroom of the team coach, Bill
Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I had to ask myself, and when I knew the answer, I
decided to quit Mock Trial,'' she said. ``This thing I had put on a
pedestal, I realized it wasn't so hot for people like me. Who you
are, what color you are _ that's how the system works in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder talked Mia into returning to the team, which this year
won the city and state championships. Now, in competition, Mia
adopts a colder, more aggressive persona. ``Mia becomes a
completely different person,'' said Snyder. ``Her face, her voice,
even her appearance, changes _ she pulls her hair back. It's a side
of her you never see anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the entire Masterman crew becomes uncharacteristically
solemn just before competitions, entering the courtroom in a silent
parade they call the Death March.
</P>
<P>
   The brainstorming sessions and trials draw out unexplored sides
of his classmates, says Khalid Taggart, the team's star closer.
``Some of us live around here, some of us come from nice parts of
town, so we get every kind of viewpoint when we argue a case.''
</P>
<P>
   A magnet school, Masterman draws academically gifted students
from throughout the area, including a neighborhood that not too
long ago was one of the city's busiest drug marketplaces. ``But
that's the reason we're so strong,'' said Simeon Poles, a
mechanic's son. ``We're diverse. That's why all the Philadelphia
schools do so well when they go to the state championships.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philly Factor became a force three years ago, when Overbrook
High School jumped from its spot on the city's academic-warning
list into the No. 1 slot among the state's Mock Trial teams.
Overbrook had never won a state title in anything, not even
basketball when Wilt Chamberlain was wearing the school's orange
and black. But in 1997, Overbrook argued its way to victory in both
the city and state Mock Trial championships, finishing 11th in the
nation, the first time a Pennsylvania school cracked the national
top 20. Every member of the team was a rookie, recruited and
trained by a history teacher who also doubled as a baseball coach.
</P>
<P>
   The year after Overbrook's success, Carver High School, from
North Philadelphia's notorious Badlands, won the city championship
and defeated dozens of prep and private schools to finish second in
the state finals.
</P>
<P>
   Voted the state's top litigator was Davysses McLaurin, a former
Carver class clown. ``Mouths were literally agape at what he was
coming up with,'' said David Trevaskis, head of Temple University
Law School's high school outreach program, which oversees
Pennsylvania's Mock Trial program.
</P>
<P>
   In the state finals, Davysses displayed poise and storytelling
finesse by ad-libbing a closing statement that wove a legal quote
he had spotted on the courthouse wall into a refutation of the
opposition's main point, and, for a final flourish, added this
touch of homespun philosophy:
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecution witness admitted he told a lie. Just one lie.
But the thing about a lie is, it never travels alone. Mmm, mmm. A
lie always travels with a friend'' _ Davysses slung an arm around
an imaginary companion _ ``Mr. Reasonable Doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hang together, that lie and Mr. Doubt. So anytime you
hear a lie, remember'' _ he jerked his head toward the metaphorical
phantom under his still-suspended arm _ ``Reasonable Doubt is in
the 'hood.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the kids on my team have lived by their wits all their
lives,'' Ms. O'Donoghue said. ``They have jobs, they cook and care
for younger siblings or their own children, they fend for
themselves on the subway. These kids go toe-to-toe with adults
every day.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way,'' she added. ``Sheepshead Bay has a
state-of-the-art courtroom; Bushwick has day care for all its
single-parent students.'' But when the two schools faced off,
Bushwick won.
</P>
<P>
   Cases are designed to be devilishly ambiguous, making it
possible to argue convincingly for either side. The defendant
Brandon Berry had left town to find a job, leaving his son with the
boy's alcoholic mother. The Berrys' troubled lives included bouts
with shady landlords, court-appointed specialists and social
services, which had once removed the boy from his mother. Did Berry
knowingly put his son at risk?
</P>
<P>
   In a courtroom at Brooklyn's federal Courthouse, Lincoln High
School's cross-examination was professionally crisp and aggressive
in the hands of the deceptively mild-mannered Corinne Atkinson. So
thoroughly had she memorized the depositions that she could
anticipate answers from Bushwick's witnesses and fire back another
question before they could finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Mallow, you were treating Mrs. Berry's alcoholism?'' she
asked, addressing Eddie Poon of Bushwick, who portrayed an
addiction specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' Eddie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put her on your 12-step program?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Eddie began, ``I was monitoring each step. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``And one of those steps led her straight back into a bar.
Correct?''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie stammered, equivocated, but couldn't find his way free.
</P>
<P>
   While Bushwick was more businesslike in its own questioning,
content with simply ascertaining facts, its defense witnesses
throbbed with emotion, especially when Emanuel Fernandez, playing
the accused father, was asked why he wasn't at home the night of
the fire. He knew his wife had a drinking problem; why wasn't he
there to watch her?
</P>
<P>
   The question seemed to prick Emanuel. ``I can't support my child
with a smile and a hug!'' he responded bitterly. ``I got to support
my child with money.'' That answer would have sufficed, but he
continued ad-libbing, his voice rising with so much anger that his
teammates began to glance at one another.
</P>
<P>
   He burst out: ``If you lived like me, you'd understand that!''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict went to Bushwick.
</P>
<P>
   With its victory, the team advanced to the city's semifinals,
the sweet-16 round, held a week later at Manhattan's federal
courthouse. There, Bushwick's underdog season came to an end with a
first-round elimination. ``Many of them had never been out of
Brooklyn before,'' explained Bushwick principal Renee Pollack.
``Maybe that threw them off.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the team stayed around the courthouse to applaud a
fellow Latino-populated high school as it advanced to the next
round: Brandeis, led by Jose Tuma, won the city championship. Two
weeks later in Albany, Brandeis finished atop 497 schools to become
the third best in the state. A few days later, a gift-wrapped
trophy was mailed to the Tuma home in Puerto Rico.

   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ If ever there were a man placed on this
earth for the purpose of being president of the University of
Virginia, it is Dr. John Casteen III.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised near Portsmouth, he entered the state's elite
public university in 1961 after turning down offers from Harvard
and Princeton, and was immediately smitten by the beauty and grace
of this campus that Thomas Jefferson designed. Casteen earned a
bachelor's degree with high honors, then a master's and a Ph.D. in
English, with a specialty in Beowulf. Along the way he learned 12
languages, won a literary award for a collection of short stories
and built a reputation as a dedicated teacher.
</P>
<P>
   When still in his 20s, he told one of the deans, Ernest Ern,
``I'm going to be president of this university,'' and to this day,
at the age of 55, when asked to name his heroes, Casteen ticks off
a list dominated by past University of Virginia presidents. One of
his formative moments as a young man came in the spring of 1970,
when he watched the University of Virginia president at the time,
Edgar Shannon _ an English scholar, a former Harvard professor and
a World War II hero _ win over a crowd of 4,000 angry anti-war
protesters gathered at the heart of the campus on the lawn near the
Rotunda. ``For the first time,'' said Casteen, ``I heard a lengthy,
serious debate about the moral basis of intellectual life and
national policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, it was Casteen's turn. A methodical, driven man with a
love of the classics, he set out to create a blueprint for his
university presidency that was finely balanced and quite
traditional. He would spend three days a week on campus guiding his
professors and deans. He would teach a literature course each
semester, to keep in touch with students and carry on the role of
the scholar president. And the remaining time he would devote to
travel, to spread word of the university's good deeds, to partake
in academic associations and to help with fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   But after three years, the university's board of trustees had no
patience for a traditional president. Casteen was in trouble. ``We
didn't know if he'd be able to continue,'' says a top university
official.
</P>
<P>
   Casteen wasn't bringing in the bucks! During the recession of
the early '90s, politicians in Richmond had taken a cleaver to
Virginia's higher education budget, in a few years' time reducing
annual state funding to the university from $178 million to $122
million.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, the University of Virginia _ one of the most respected
public universities in the country _ was receiving just 13 percent
of its operating budget from the state.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, the board wanted one thing beyond all others from
Casteen: money. University trustees feared that without a major
fund-raising drive, the school's quality and reputation would
suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The board's new marching orders were quite specific: Four out of
every five days Casteen was to be on the road fund raising. And no
more teaching; that was a relic of the past. ``They wanted me
outside selling,'' Casteen recalls. ``They were upset I was
spending three days a week on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   As Joshua Darden, a former university board chairman, said:
``The seven-figure donors, they want to see the president, it makes
them feel important. John had to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   What Casteen has accomplished in the six years since has been
impressive. He has raised $884 million on his way to a goal of $1
billion by the end of the year 2000, one of the largest
fund-raising efforts by a public university. The drive has endowed
514 new scholarships and 135 professorships, greatly expanded the
library collection and raised salaries, helping the university hold
on to its talented faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Such financial strength has played a role in keeping Virginia
the top-rated public university for five years in a row on the
influential U.S. News &AMP; World Report college survey. By fattening
the endowment to $1.2 billion during this era of shrinking
government support, Casteen has also helped insulate his university
from some of the political whims emanating from Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   But all this has come at both a professional and a personal
cost. He was criticized last year as an absentee leader in an
editorial in the student newspaper, which nicknamed him Capital
Campaigner Casteen. And while Casteen is a private man who rarely
discusses his personal life even with those closest to him, friends
say the fund-raising roadshow contributed to the breakup of his
second marriage.
</P>
<P>
   If the enduring image of Shannon was that of a man talking
reason to 4,000 protesters, the enduring image of Casteen on campus
may well be of a man schmoozing up alumni at the president's
residence; last year he opened Carr's Hill, the president's home,
for more than 150 fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this considered extreme these days, even for a public
university. In fact, it is rapidly becoming the norm. At one
meeting of Casteen's cabinet, nobody blinked when he explained what
he would be doing in the next months. ``I plan to get pretty deeply
into people's pockets,'' said the Beowulf scholar.
</P>
<P>
   It is remarkable how fund raising has come to preoccupy top
people at even public universities. This is not something a
president is allowed to delegate anymore. As one Casteen aide,
Gordon Burris, says, ``We need the president making the ask.'' And
as another aide, Robert Sweeney, says, ``They want to see the
president when it's time for the closer.'' And in between, says
Casteen, ``you really have to work on cultivation.'' Otherwise, the
president's time is his own.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, in the face of lagging state support, several
public universities, including Berkeley, the University of
California at Los Angeles and the University of Michigan, have
undertaken billion-dollar fund-raising drives, according to the
latest report from the Council for Advancement and Support of
Education in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While at first blush this would sound like good news for
America's public universities _ how can you argue with more money?
_ free money often has its price. At the University of Virginia,
for example, major donors tend to be out-of-state businessmen,
alumni who have gone off into the larger world and made their
fortune. They complain about the need to have more out-of-state
students accepted to give the university a more global perspective
(the current ratio among the 18,500 students is one-third out of
state, two-thirds in state). And they'd like to see less state
interference, perhaps even ending the university's public status
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity to wean ourselves off state support,''
said Everette Doffermyre, an Atlanta lawyer and donor, at an alumni
fund-raising gathering in Tucson last year. ``This is our chance to
get control of U-Va.'s destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Professors also worry that donors will pressure universities on
policy as well as admission preference for their children.
</P>
<P>
   University officials say such concerns are exaggerated, and the
benefits outweigh the potential conflicts. One reason Casteen has
come to embrace his fund-raising role was his experience in the
1970s as a professor at another great public university, the
University of California at Berkeley. There he saw firsthand how
the school suffered when its leadership got locked in funding
battles with Gov. Ronald Reagan. ``It made me realize public
institutions are fragile,'' he says, ``and the need for some degree
of financial autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among presidents, Casteen is considered a master of the soft
sell. He was guest speaker last year at a meeting of Maryland's 13
public university presidents, who sat around a horseshoe-shaped
table at their headquarters in Adelphi taking notes on Casteen's
sure-fire fund-raising tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``To conceive of fund raising as making a pitch is missing the
point,'' began Casteen, explaining that the real way to win over
alumni is to get them enmeshed with the university's future.
``Money's only one part of what you need to ask for,'' he said. ``I
ask for their vision of the university, I ask for their political
support, I ask for their membership on committees, I ask for their
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The president must make the ask, he said, because the president
embodies the university, and ``people donate to a person, not a
committee.'' He told the university presidents how he'd tried to
set a tone, including making his own pledge ($50,000, simply listed
alphabetically in the alumni donation publication); giving up
teaching (``If I was going to be on campus three days a week, I
wasn't going to be in Chicago in front of a guy at the Commodities
Exchange''); and using his house for events whenever he's on campus
(``There is a serious relationship between people coming into my
house for a reception before ball games and being a large donor'').
</P>
<P>
   He talked about how he used surveys and national rankings to put
goals into focus for donors. ``We did some research and discovered
we're the largest university left without a concert hall,'' he
said, a fact he constantly drops at alumni functions. He personally
rewrites fund-raising letters. (``They have to inspire,'' said the
former short story writer.) And he spent a half-hour going over his
appointment book. (``This man likes to take a walk around campus _
he wants to walk, we walk. ... This event, I'm not the center, I'm
there to add a little weight to the party.'')
</P>
<P>
   After an hour and a half, the presidents gave him a rousing
hand. Dr. Hoke Smith, Towson University president, said that these
fund-raising seminars usually focus on the technical, like the
ratio of initial contacts to closures. ``This was spiritual,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   And this is precisely how Casteen landed $1.2 million for a new
media center. In 1996, Casteen and one of his fund-raisers visited
a wealthy alumnus, Tim Robertson (U-Va. '77, son of the evangelist
Pat and president at the time of the Family Channel cable network).
``John always brings somebody for support,'' Robertson says. ``It's
a lot more pressure when they bring two or three guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Casteen asked what Robertson felt the university was lacking,
and the TV executive suggested that the English department needed a
media center to tap into the talent and wealth of the television
world. ``They thought that was a great idea,'' recalls Robertson.
``They said they'd get back to me. I was amazed at how fast they
did.'' In a few weeks, Casteen was visiting again, this time with
his arts and sciences dean. ``They had a whole curriculum laid out
_ so fast!'' says Robertson. ``John said we'll need x amount to
endow a professorship, x to set aside this floor at the library.''
</P>
<P>
   After the deal was clinched, the university announced it _
several times. ``They milked it for all its press value,''
Robertson says.
</P>
<P>
   How does a man like Casteen, with so many intellectual gifts,
have the patience and will to spend so much time on the road
begging for money, alumni dinner after alumni dinner, cocktail
party after cocktail party, the same speeches, the same
conversations? A student reporter once asked how he did it, and
Casteen's answer was fascinating for how little insight it
provided. ``To maintain the necessary pace,'' Casteen said, ``you
don't do anything magic, you keep your head clear, you exercise,
you sleep, you follow rules of moderation.'' Rather than a peek
into Casteen's pyche, this was his fitness regimen for
ultra-marathon fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, today's university president often resembles the
national television-age politician _ public figures who don't have
an internal world or the ability to convey it, even though they are
quite intelligent. That lack of introspection can be precisely what
enables them to operate so effectively in the public arenas where
they dwell.
</P>
<P>
   Casteen himself was briefly in government, serving in the 1980s
as state secretary of education to Gov. Charles Robb, a Democrat.
He is shrewd politically, which has enabled him to continue as
university president under both Democratic and Republican
governors. When he speaks, he has a way of looking at you and
raising an eyebrow, of starting an idea and not quite finishing it,
often seeming to say more than his words while never really
answering that controversial question.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, as his vice president for development,
Sweeney, points out, ``he can deliver an impressive 40-minute
speech on anything with no notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he's constantly under pressure, rarely is there a crack
in his game face. ``I've seen him at a million tough moments when I
know his stomach had to be churning,'' says Ern, the dean, ``but
John never lets on, that's part of the mystique. He doesn't let you
see inside.''
</P>
<P>
   As to what really is going on inside, even those closest to
Casteen say it's hard to know. ``I've never engaged an individual
who can talk in such detail of hiking Dismal Swamp and say so
little about himself,'' says Ern, referring to Casteen's passion
for the outdoors. Even Casteen's brother Tim says, ``I don't know
how much I can help; he doesn't open up much.''
</P>
<P>
   Casteen will not discuss how the demands of fund raising
affected his marriage or his relationship with his three grown
children (nor would he permit interviews with them). But as one
friend says, if you spend 80 percent of your work time on the road
and when you are on campus you open your house for more than 150
fund-raising events a year, there is little time for a personal
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the spouse doesn't thrive in the fishbowl business,''
another friend says, ``it's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Casteen's former wife, Lotta, an English professor at the
university, declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   To meet John Casteen III you would assume he was born to this
elite world, but that is not so. His father and grandfather were
shipyard workers in Portsmouth, and his parents still live in the
same house where Casteen and his two brothers grew up. To this day,
the brothers _ Dennis, a quality control worker at Norfolk Naval
Base, and Tim, a fourth-grade public schoolteacher _ live on the
same block as their mom and dad.
</P>
<P>
   The very things that have led Casteen to take a different route
from the rest of his family also help make him the perfect
fund-raiser for the University of Virginia. For his own worldly
success illustrates the possibilities that a great public
university can open up for a boy or girl of modest means.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior at Cradock High School in Portsmouth in 1961, he was
accepted to Harvard and Princeton but could not afford either of
those private universities. He chose Virginia after the dean of
admissions, Marvin Perry, made a visit to the Casteen home to
recruit this bright student and, sitting at the kitchen table,
showed the family how it could afford the state school with its
lower tuition.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   John III was the first Casteen to attend college. From the time
he entered, he always worked to help pay his way, in the dining
hall, at the library, unloading trucks at Morton Frozen Foods.
</P>
<P>
   He had trouble adjusting at first, didn't have the sureness of
students from the elite private schools. As a freshman, he
struggled to post a B-minus/C-plus average. But during his
sophomore year, he developed more confidence that this was a place
he belonged, and he rarely got anything less than A's. From then
on, the university felt almost magical. It was there that he met
professors like William Faulkner and John Dos Passos, who turned
him toward literature.
</P>
<P>
   After five years in California, as a professor at Berkeley,
Casteen returned to Charlottesville to be the University of
Virginia's dean of admissions from 1975 to 1982. It was during this
time that he began to return the favor that the university had done
for him. Under Casteen, black student enrollment jumped from 2
percent to 11 percent, the current level. Nor was this a token
effort. The four-year graduation rate of black students at Virginia
_ 84 percent _ has long been the highest of any public university
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1970s, when Casteen was laying that groundwork, he
would spend his Sundays driving the state, visiting black churches,
trying to convince parents that this university, which had been
segregated into the 1960s, would now welcome their sons and
daughters, that their children belonged at the state's elite public
college.
</P>
<P>
   Casteen was doing for those families what Marvin Perry had done
for him two decades before, sitting in the kitchen on Wildwood
Road, explaining that a family could manage to send a child to a
great university on a shipyard worker's salary.
</P>
<P>
   The university has undertaken only one other capital campaign
since it was chartered in 1819. In the early 1980s, it set a goal
of $90 million, raised $137 million in three years and promptly
dismantled its development office, which is how things stood until
Casteen took over. ``We could never let that happen again,''
Sweeney says. ``We can't afford to lose momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   So while there is still more than a year left in the current
billion-dollar drive, the Capital Campaigner is already laying the
groundwork for the next one. During the last year, he has been
holding weekend retreats at resorts around the country _ in Tucson,
Ariz., Martha's Vineyard, Mass., and Kiawah Island, S.C. _ with
small groups of rich, hand-selected alumni in their 30s and 40s who
Casteen hopes will run the next campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tucson retreat, held at the Westin Paloma resort, where
rooms go for $350 a night, all costs for the weekend for the dozen
alumni and their spouses were picked up by the university. They
flew in from all over the country, some in private planes, and one,
Louis Elson, whose family made its fortune in airport stores,
arrived from London. All were long-term donors. A few had already
given more than $1 million; half had given more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Casteen, who makes $360,643 a year, didn't just drop in, make a
speech and leave. He spent the entire weekend, joining the alumni
for seminars, meals, drinks, brainstorming sessions and lectures.
</P>
<P>
   After a Friday-evening cocktail hour on the patio, with the sun
setting behind the desert mountains, the president delivered a
speech at dinner on the decline of state aid to the university.
This is why, he said, he was assembling a group of 100 families
``to take the leadership for the next drive. You are about to take
ownership of this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Before saying good night, Casteen told them, ``I'll see you in
the morning. We go to work at the godawful hour of 7:30.'' And sure
enough, these bankers and venture capitalists, corporate lawyers
and computer software entrepreneurs, were all there at that
godawful hour, dressed in their khakis and polo shirts, shaved,
showered and ready for a seminar on how the university will need to
change by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   During the entire weekend, no one asked for money. The word was
rarely spoken. ``At U-Va.,'' said John L. Lewis IV, an investment
manager and six-figure donor, ``gentlemen don't discuss their money
or their grades.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about strengthening their bonds to the university,''
Casteen said. ``These people understand why they're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bert Ellis _ who a few years ago sold his chain of 13
television stations for $745 million _ had a keen grasp of why.
``After I sold my company I gave a half million to the university
and allocated stock, so I guess that's when I jumped up to this
level,'' he said. ``My wife and I can't spend the money we have. We
love this university. Being a giver here is fun. I'm not anonymous.
I want recognition. I want some tickets to the ball games.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Virginia's governors, Democratic or Republican,
have not been kind to higher education. During the early 1990s, it
was Gov. Douglas Wilder, a Democrat, who cut state aid to the
public universities. And now that Casteen has overcome those cuts
through aggressive fund raising, a new governor, James Gilmore, a
Republican, has formed a 39-member commission to study whether the
state should have more control over how those private donations are
being used.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gilmore thought he was going to make political hay on
this one, he gauged wrong. Editorial writers, business people and
student leaders have blasted him for being hypocritical _ on one
hand, the state has cut its support, on the other the state wants
control of private money the university raised to fill the state
budget gap. In a vote of confidence for Casteen and the other state
university presidents, a bipartisan legislative committee this year
asked the governor and his commission to ``cease and desist.''
While the commission continued to hold hearings, says Darden, the
former trustee, ``they've been a real snore.'' Gilmore is seeing
firsthand, free money has its price.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing like an outside enemy to unite a community; the
governor and his commission have succeeded in making Casteen a
popular man in Charlottesville. In an editorial this past school
year, the student newspaper apologized for its earlier criticisms,
citing the ``tremendous success of the campaign,'' and
acknowledging that ``Casteen's leadership has even humbled the
editorial powers that be of this newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not often that students admit to error _ certainly not in
print _ and it must have given Casteen a great sense of
vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he says. There is a pause, he lifts an eyebrow, but
says no more.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SWARTHMORE, Pa. _ Right in the middle of a game, Brian Bell
realized he had lost his motivation to play football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never had I felt so helpless, where your actions don't make a
difference,'' Bell said, recalling his disillusionment with the
administration at Swarthmore College. ``If they are not committed,
then what's the point?''
</P>
<P>
   If a highly motivated student and athlete like Brian Bell was
unhappy, then football was in big trouble at Swarthmore, which
first fielded a team in 1878.
</P>
<P>
   By that 1997 season, Swarthmore was unable to compete even on a
modest scale. It was losing badly, its little stadium was
practically empty, recruiting had fallen off, and players were
quitting in the middle of the season, if not actually in the middle
of games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the school could do away with football and it probably
wouldn't make the front page of the school newspaper,'' said J.P.
Harris, the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   There were, perhaps, enough reasons for Swarthmore to end
football, as other schools have done. But the college, invoking its
Quaker tradition of talking things over, began an internal debate
about whether football had any educational and communal value to
one of the more distinguished private colleges in America.
</P>
<P>
   The response was an open-ended commitment to upgrade the
program, using more aggressive recruiting and more money, in
particular an anonymous $100,000 gift from an alumnus to underwrite
some of the major costs like feeding and transporting these
large-sized undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   Success has not been immediate for the Garnet Tide. In the first
year, the team still lost every game, and its losing streak has now
reached 28 straight games _ the longest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When they talk about football, Swarthmore administrators sound a
little like bemused relatives who inherit a clunky heirloom from
honored ancestors. They try to respect it, to maintain it, but this
is not exactly a place where people go around chanting, ``Goin' to
Pasadena! In a Winnebago!'' as they might at a Big 10 mega-campus
on its way to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   (At Notre Dame, in the fall, one could attend the most serious
convocation on liberation theology and soon be aware of whom the
Fighting Irish were playing next Saturday.)
</P>
<P>
   The costs and demands have begun to impress themselves on
Swarthmore's leaders. The reality is that football is more high
maintenance than any other activity on campus. It involves coaches,
equipment, food, travel, open fields, hard afternoons of practice,
recruiting trips and _ perhaps most important _ an admissions
department that sees something positive in young male applicants
with broad shoulders and a certain inclination to whack other
people around on autumn afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Must there be a place for this sport at a small, elite college
like Swarthmore? Just exactly where is the law that says higher
education needs a football team to, pardon the expression, kick off
the academic year? Some Swatties, as they are known, ask that
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me the choice was either go to the library to study or go
to a football game _ so I chose the library,'' said Ethan Devine,
who graduated in the spring and works as a Latin American equities
research analyst for Goldman Sachs in New York City. ``I remember a
lot of people saying they were happy they graduated and the
football team hadn't won a game,'' he said. ``They think the whole
thing should be abandoned, and they're pretty bitter that that much
energy is put into it.'' Devine has never attended a game.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Wu, president of the campus Asian Society, also thinks
funds could be better utilized. He suggests new faculty members and
a student center. ``It's an academically focused institution,'' he
said. ``Focusing our money on sports is not beneficial for most of
the people at Swarthmore.''
</P>
<P>
   Swarthmore's tiny and peaceful campus, in a leafy suburb of
Philadelphia, has a decidedly 19th-century feel. The old main
building, Parrish Hall, looms at the top of a long, graceful hill.
By contrast, the athletic department is at the bottom of the hill,
separated from the main campus by a railroad line.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,300 eclectic students have things to do other than watch
football. A school brochure includes a sampling of campus
activities: several a cappella groups, the Civil Liberties Society,
Conscious Consumers, Earthlust (an environmental group),
Firefighters, Martial Arts, Mad Wriggles (madrigal singers) and
Swarming Earthworms (Men's Ultimate), a highly physical version of
Frisbee. The campus is a registered arboretum, and every April
Fools' Day _ how typically Swarthmore _ students change the names
of the plants and trees with fake placards, sometimes using arcane
Latin puns.
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton Review's ``Best Colleges'' 1999 edition says of
Swarthmore: ``What's Hot: Campus is beautiful, honesty, school runs
like butter, left-wing politics, dorms. What's Not Hot: religion,
hard liquor, drugs, beer, Greeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere else it would be a Ph.D.'' is the semiofficial slogan
of the bachelor program at Swarthmore, which U.S. News &AMP; World
Report ranks just behind Amherst as the country's top liberal arts
college. Grading is so tough some students complain they are
hindered in acceptance to graduate schools.
</P>
<P>
   Football has somehow managed to survive here. Early in the
century, Swarthmore competed with many major Eastern schools, but
as the sport became a powerhouse at some of them, the college
settled for the modest Division III, with its lack of athletic
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Hall played football here in the early 1950s and later
pitched 14 seasons in the major leagues, mostly with the Baltimore
Orioles. Now a semiretired accountant in Timonium, Md., the lanky
Hall recalls with amusement a later period when Swarthmore ``hired
a good coach, and there was a question of whether they were winning
too much.''
</P>
<P>
   This ambivalence seems a recurrent theme. Neil Austrian, now the
president of the National Football League, was Swarthmore's captain
and quarterback in 1960. ``If I followed everybody else on a
Saturday afternoon, I would have wound up in the library,'' he said
recently. In Austrian's day, one of the big rivals was Haverford,
on the Main Line of Philadelphia, but that school gave up the game
in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football consumes a disproportionate amount of resources,
certainly the financial resources, time and the energy to do it
right,'' said Greg Kannerstein, the athletic director at Haverford
College. Kannerstein admitted he missed football as a community
event but said it was too difficult to recruit 60 to 80 men out of
a male enrollment of 550.
</P>
<P>
   At least 22 colleges or universities have dropped football in
the '90s, mostly for economic reasons. Officials at Boston
University emphasize that Title IX, the federal law mandating
gender equity in school sports, was not behind its decision to
close its program in 1997, as was frequently reported. It folded
football because of lack of interest. In the final season, an
average of 2,500 fans attended home games in the 13,000-seat
Nickerson Field. Boston University, which played Division 1-AA, a
higher level than Swarthmore, had just two winning seasons from
1985 to 1997, not enough for it to justify spending $3 million a
year in scholarships and operational costs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he missed football, Boston's athletic director,
Gary Strickler, said, ``Yes, I do personally, but I don't know that
it's been a great void in our program, to be honest.'' There was a
fervent and angry and small group of football supporters, but
administrators say it has not remained a presence. The sport will
not be back, or certainly not anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is downward. According to the National Collegiate
Athletic Association, its membership and the number of football
teams is growing. But the rate of participation is declining. In
1956, 80 percent of member schools fielded a team. That percentage
dipped to 70 percent by 1971, 63.1 percent by 1981 and 58.6 percent
by 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, football has a huge psychic hold on America. Many
campuses embrace it with zeal, and the resources of a Fortune 500
company. There is the old story about the college president who
wants to have an institution the football team can be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Chicago, Fordham and Villanova gave up
football and then started it anew. They decided something had been
lost in campus life. And after 135 years of existence, little
Bryant College, a business school in Rhode Island, decided to field
its first team last year, hoping it might draw people onto campus
in the fall and attract students.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bell, a wiry 6-foot-1, 190-pounder from Laurel, Del., had
played in two state championship games in high school. He was
recruited by the University of Delaware but worried that he might
not have been first string until his senior year. He met a
Swarthmore alumnus through an enrichment program in his hometown
and is sure he chose the right college, but his love of football
was sorely tested by the lack of success.
</P>
<P>
   In fall 1997, Swarthmore lost its first five games by margins of
56, 73, 49, 31 and 46 points, and Bell fought the urge to walk off
the field. Then the Tide went to California to play Pomona-Pitzer,
the team representing two of the prestigious Claremont colleges,
and was beaten by 64 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were making light of it, and that really hurt,'' said
J.P. Harris, the quarterback. ``We felt we were on our own. The
school spits out a lot of rhetoric on excellence, but we didn't
feel they were doing that on athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, losing was our fault. I'm never going to blame
anybody else. If you look at it, playing ball is a full-time job,
30 hours a week. Nobody is holding a gun to your head, but we
didn't feel that the effort was being reciprocated.''
</P>
<P>
   There were just not enough football players coming in, and some
already there were defecting. Feeling overmatched, at least seven
quit. ``Guys were doing a cost-benefit analysis about playing
football,'' recalled Bell, now beginning a career with Arthur
Andersen, the accounting firm. ``I had to make a decision myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``One thing I learned from football was commitment.
These are the moments that define you. You started something. What
are the messages you are sending to younger guys if you quit?''
</P>
<P>
   As the 1997 season ended with four more lopsided losses,
Swarthmore president Alfred H. Bloom considered ending the program.
``If I had felt it was necessary, I could have recommended it,''
said Bloom, who said he had extremely limited experience with
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students came to me, disheartened,'' he said. ``Football
was not living up to their expectations. I spoke to several alums.
It was clear to me that we would be in a better position to attract
people if we had football, but Swarthmore was letting them down by
not having an exciting program.''
</P>
<P>
   The school acknowledged a general malaise among students, and
found critics on the faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Schwartz, a psychology professor and onetime associate
provost, is knowledgeable about sports but skeptical about
football's value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students are worried that the need for bodies on the team
will skew the admissions process,'' he said, adding: ``Diversity is
a good thing. It's hard to sustain it if you need 75 people on the
football team.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most eloquent defenders of the sport turned out to be
Jennie Keith, the provost, a Quaker, an anthropologist and
decidedly not a football fan. ``We are an extraordinarily cerebral
place, but there is a pitfall in going beyond cerebral to
disdaining what is not of the brain,'' she said. ``It is against
the Quaker tradition to stereotype people. When people talk about
football, I stop to remember that my brother played center in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football brings us some kids who would not have us on their
radar screen,'' Dr. Keith added. ``We do intellectual work, trying
to understand life, but we need to combine this with some action in
the more messy world.''
</P>
<P>
   The players, quite naturally, felt threatened by even a debate.
``They throw around the word `diversity' and that applies to
everybody but athletes,'' said Harris, a political science major
from Derry, N.H., who will attend Catholic University Law School
this fall. ``Athletes are a minority here. You hear about 20
athletes being admitted, 10 percent, isn't that high? The
implication is, Are you really worthy?''
</P>
<P>
   Harris rallied his teammates. He and several other players
sought out Austrian, a member of the board. He reassured the
players that trustees still wanted football. There was a consensus
that the sport needed affirmation if it was to continue.
</P>
<P>
   After much discussion, the hierarchy did exactly the same thing
big-time foundries do _ it removed the coach, Karl Miran, whose
record was 25 victories, 51 losses and 1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was very uncharacteristic of Swarthmore College,'' said
athletic director Robert Williams. ``We agonized over the decision,
but if we were going to continue, we were going to have to bring in
new leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The new coach was Peter Alvanos, 33, who had been an assistant
at the University of Chicago. Impressing people with his energy,
Alvanos, young, fiery and ambitious, was able to gain some perks
Miran surely would have loved.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of two and a half coaching positions, Alvanos now has
four (two of them doubling as track and field assistants), plus
several part-timers. According to Williams, coaching costs are
about $150,000 a year, close to double what they were two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is somewhat more expensive than other intercollegiate
athletic programs at Swarthmore,'' said Dr. Keith. ``That greater
cost is one of the challenges in maintaining a football program
here.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 1997-98 school year, Swarthmore spent $47,116 for
travel, equipment and to hire game officials _ roughly one-quarter
the cost of all 12 men's teams. An undisclosed portion of $10.9
million in financial aid goes to players. There is no tangible
revenue, as there is at universities that charge admission to games
or have television income.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Williams expects the upgraded program to become more expensive
in the near future. The school has allocated $20,000 for a new look
in uniforms and equipment _ a sore point to other campus teams.
(Xiang Lan Zhou, 21, an engineering major who plays on the
badminton team, complains about the struggle to get money for
birdies.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing football with under 40 student athletes,''
Williams said. ``If this is successful, we'll have 65 to 70
athletes. That will mean more equipment, more beds, more food.
Instead of one bus, we'll need a bus and a van. It doesn't just
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Money, however, is only one factor in football success. The
other is recruiting. At most colleges and universities, coaches
shake their fists at the sacrosanct admissions office, telling
horror stories of the brilliant blue-chip recruit who got away.
Before Swarthmore's new coach was hired, the athletic director read
him the facts of life: the only legitimate recruiting agent on
campus is the admissions office.
</P>
<P>
   At Swarthmore, the new dean of admissions is Robin Mamlet, who
worked at Occidental College, Pomona and Sarah Lawrence without
gaining much feel for football. ``You listen to the voices of the
institution, and they come from different places,'' Ms. Mamlet
said. ``We've always been proud of an engineering degree at a
liberal arts college. That's a voice. The football voice? That is
nebulous.''
</P>
<P>
   When they began talking about the future of football, Ms. Mamlet
said, ``we asked, `What is our responsibility?' '' The answer was:
``At least make it moderately safe'' _ meaning enough bodies so the
players would not be overwhelmed and exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to start each season with 65 to 75 players, to
account for practice, backup for injuries and attrition. The hope
was that there would be 20 bona fide players among the 180 young
men accepted each year, about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is significant,'' Ms. Mamlet said. ``That gets your
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the school year ended in 1998, Alvanos assembled the
players who would be returning in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget his first words,'' said Harris, then going
into his senior year. ``He said, `Take off your hats and sit up
straight!' The room fell dead silent, and that's when I knew things
were going to be different.'' (As it happens, those were pretty
much the first words of Lou Holtz when he began his epic regime at
Notre Dame.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen guys work out so hard,'' the quarterback said.
``I didn't think we were any more gifted, but the improvement was
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvanos began involving the community, asking a marching band
from a local high school to play, and invited faculty members to be
his assistant for a game. Ms. Mamlet was on the sideline for a
wrenching 21-13 loss to Ursinus.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are kids I know,'' Ms. Mamlet said. ``I admitted them. I
was watching them do something that turned out unsuccessfully, but
there was so much drama when the coach sent them out there. It made
me realize even more that athletics have their place, to watch our
kids having fun, pouring their hearts into something physical.''
</P>
<P>
   When a dubious pass interference call set up a last-minute
winning touchdown by Franklin and Marshall College, they railed
against the officials with uncharacteristic volume and language
that would have been appropriate at a Philadelphia Eagles game.
</P>
<P>
   Alvanos' final 1998 record was eight straight losses, but Bell
called the season ``awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   At football powerhouses, on the morning after the last game,
coaches fan out all over the continent in search of new behemoths,
trying to charm the mothers and fathers of prospective recruits.
Williams, who began his coaching career at Rutgers University, said
with a chuckle: ``You can't really call what we do recruiting.''
Alvanos and his assistants tend to travel by car three to four
hours from campus. For the rest of the country, they rely on
recommendations, with candidates visiting campus on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Alvanos said he does not even begin to recruit a player unless
he has an SAT score of 1250. Ms. Mamlet said 1300 sounds a bit more
like it. She said the median SAT score at Swarthmore is 1440, and
though there is slight leeway for students with special skills or
gifts, football players fall within the norm, in potential as well
as in performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final call is hers, and we respect that,'' Alvanos said.
``If she says, `Coach, you're wasting your time,' we're going to
cut him loose. If she says, `Coach, this one looks good,' we go
after him.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvanos is delighted to have recruited, by long distance, a
couple of backs who were sought by rival schools, as well as two
offensive linemen from the South, both around 6 feet 3, 265 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard has proven to me, personally, that football can be
played at every top-notch institution in America, if they do it
within the philosophy of that college,'' Alvanos said. ``We didn't
come here to make football bigger than the college. It's an outlet
for the kids, a way to let their hair down, let their minds be at
peace for two hours at practice, get rid of frustration or anxiety.
Some people go for walks, some people read books to relax, these
kids come here to play football.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is value to the participants, what is the value to the
campus?
</P>
<P>
   Community building is the rationale for football at many
colleges. You hear it everywhere, including here. ``Look at it this
way,'' Alvanos said. ``The only sport I know that has homecoming is
football, and that happens in the fall. It sets the tone for the
academic year. It brings people together. A Saturday afternoon of
enjoyment _ if you win, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bloom was asked whether he could see himself pulling the
plug on football somewhere down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not yet the time to talk about it,'' he said. ``This
is still an experiment. I have full confidence it will succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Swarthmore's new season begins Sept. 4, when it matches its
28-game winless streak against Oberlin of Ohio. Oberlin has not won
in 19 straight games (following a previous 40-game streak).
Something has to give.
</P>
<P>
   The classic definition of football comes from Vince Lombardi of
Green Bay Packer fame: ``Winning isn't everything, it's the only
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Swarthmore's version comes from Dr. Keith (who has indeed heard
of Vince Lombardi): Winning isn't everything _ but it is certainly
something.'' &QL;

SON OF FORMER FOOTBALL GREAT DIES IN ATLANTA RAMPAGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn. Ga., Pa.) 
 
By ERIC HANSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For several hours, Kevin Dial's relatives hoped and
prayed that he had survived the gunfire at his Atlanta office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he had been shot but were hoping he would make it,''
Dial's aunt, Carolyn Burris, said Friday in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Dial, son of former college and professional football star Buddy
Dial, worked for Houston-based Momentum Securities and had moved to
Atlanta to help establish the company's office there. He was among
nine people shot to death during an investor's rampage Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Upset over stock trading losses, the investor killed the nine at
two Atlanta office buildings after he had killed his wife and two
children. He committed suicide when police were about to arrest
him.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Dial, 37, was a graduate of the University of Texas and
worked in Tyler, Texas, before transferring to Atlanta about a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Before word of the rampage hit the television news around 2 p.m.
CDT, Burris said, someone in the Atlanta office called Momentum's
Dallas office and told Kevin's brother, David, that Kevin had been
shot and was probably dead.
</P>
<P>
   Burris said her own son then began calling every Atlanta-area
hospital hoping to hear that Kevin, who had never married, was
being treated at an emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he couldn't find him registered anywhere by 5:30 p.m.
yesterday, he felt Kevin was dead,'' she said. ``He kept that to
himself because we were still hoping. The hope went away last night
at 11:30 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Burris said Kevin's identification was delayed because he
usually put his wallet in his desk shortly after arriving at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, we never lost hope until it was actually verified,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Kevin had been busy lately working out the details to
transfer to Austin, Texas, where his mother lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister is just devastated by this, '' Burris said.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime friend Howard Castleberry said Momentum's Tyler office
was doing well and that the company had asked him to help set up a
new branch in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a success,'' Castleberry said. ``The ironic thing is
that he wanted to come back to Houston or Austin badly and was
scheduled to come back to Texas on July 1.''
</P>
<P>
   The transfer was delayed however until later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was disappointed but was willing to wait,'' Castleberry
said. ``Instead, he's coming back in a box.``
</P>
<P>
   Castleberry said Dial's friends in Houston and Austin were
shocked and bewildered. ``He was one of the most loving guys you
could ever meet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't care for Atlanta too much,'' said another friend,
Tim Collins. ``He was homesick because all his friends and family
were here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it is a cliche, but he really was one of the finest
people you ever would want to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Burris, too, said Kevin was widely loved and respected. ``He had
so many friends,'' she said. ''Hundreds of people are grieving.''
</P>
<P>
   A Momentum official in Houston said Friday that the last 24
hours had been ``hell for our employees and customers.''
</P>
<P>
   James Lee, principal of Momentum, described Dial as a loyal
office manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're devastated by this,'' Lee told a news conference. ``We
don't know why it happened. We'll probably never know. We're
grieving for our employees, our customers, their families and their
loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee did not take reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling her nephew's good deeds, Burris said he would often
take his 82-year-old grandmother, Verneda Howell, to church
banquets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those little old ladies up there just thought he was the most
precious thing in the world,'' she said. ``He called just a day ago
and left a message on her recorder that he loved her and would call
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the most outgoing, loving people you would ever
want to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   About 19 months ago, Burris said, her nephew ``was diagnosed
with an inoperable brain tumor and had been taking medicine to try
and prevent seizures.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Here of late, '' she said, ``he had been having quite a few
more seizures. We feel like the Lord took him this way rather than
letting him suffer with a stroke or being paralyzed or crippled or
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Burris said she could not understand why a disgruntled person
would take out his frustrations on others.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was so angry, why didn't he just shoot himself?'' she
said sobbing. ``Why did he go out and kill all these innocent
people? It is so sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Dial was unavailable for comment, said a family friend who
answered the former football player's telephone in Tomball, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Dial, 62, was an All-American end at Rice University before
playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1959-63 and the Dallas
Cowboys from 1964-66.
</P>
<P>
   His playing days were cut short by injuries that have left him
in almost constant pain. Earlier this year, a federal appeals court
vacated an order that allowed him to recover full benefits from the
National Football League's disability plan.

 &HT;    Lake hired to help Gore develop winning message with women
 &HT;    Moving in national and political categories for release on Aug.

 &HT;    By Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The recent hiring of pollster Celinda Lake is the
strongest signal yet that Vice President Al Gore recognizes the
importance of women to his White House hopes.
</P>
<P>
   But don't try to categorize Lake as simply specializing in
``women's issues.'' Lake has been polling for Democrats for more
than two decades and has advised candidates in Eastern European
countries and South Africa. Today, she is one of the Democratic
Party's leading political strategists, and even those on the
opposite side acknowledge that she has keen insights and skills in
developing a winning message for politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is one of the best at peeling the skin off the onion,
getting to the root of the problem and creating a message,'' said
Jeff Lewis, a lifelong Republican who has occasionally hired Lake
in his role as executive director of the Teresa and H. John Heinz
III Foundation. ``I suspect that's why Gore wants her on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials declined to discuss what role Lake would
have in the vice president's campaign. Gore already has a chief
pollster, Mark Penn, who also did polling for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Lake indicated during an interview last week that her
role in the Gore campaign was still being negotiated and she would
not discuss that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her comments, as well as her recent polling, provided
clear enough evidence of what Lake's chief advice to Gore is going
to be: If you expect to beat Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
likely Republican nominee next year, you're going to have to win
the vote of women, first, and seniors, second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can lose the men and win, but we can't lose the men and
women and win,'' she said. ``And seniors have to be a big target
group, if not the target group, for Democrats across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake objects to the ``stereotyping'' of her as specializing in
women's issues. A baby boomer native of Montana, she has always
worked for ``progressive'' candidates, regardless of gender.
</P>
<P>
   But the so-called ``gender gap'' that has developed in modern
politics has, quite naturally, led her to focus increasingly on
women's issues and women candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a majority of the electorate, two-thirds of the swing
vote and two-thirds of the late swing vote (voters who decide in
the final two weeks of a campaign),'' she said. And while many
Americans are increasingly dismayed by politics, ``women are often
the ones who are paying attention,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The ``gender gap,'' the differences between women and men in
political attitudes and voting choices, has been evident since
1980, when Ronald Reagan won the presidency largely on the strength
of his appeal to men.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two presidential elections, Clinton received his
winning margin from women: 54 to 43 percent over Bob Dole in 1996
and 45 to 41 percent over President George H.W. Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, the Gore campaign has been shocked by
polls showing the vice president trailing the Texas governor, even
among women.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, for example, Gore trailed Bush 52 to 42 percent
among women in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll. Within a week, the Gore
campaign hosted a rally in which Gore and his wife Tipper,
surrounded by dozens of women elected officials, invoked his role
as a son, husband and father.
</P>
<P>
   The rally also featured first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
endorsing the vice president with praise for being ``out front for
women, for children, for families throughout his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speeches also increasingly included references to his
mother, Pauline, as a major inspiration in his life _ a woman who
graduated from Vanderbilt law school while living at the YWCA and
working as a waitress for 25-cent tips.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore has repeatedly lashed out at the gun lobby in pushing
for stricter gun controls, an issue that women in both parties
overwhelmingly support.
</P>
<P>
   But in late June, in the ``Battleground'' poll Lake periodically
conducts with Republican Ed Goeas, Gore lost to Bush 48 to 39
percent among women. Lake's conclusion: ``It is a formidable
presidential contest.'' And not long after that, the Gore campaign
asked Lake to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lake's ``Battleground'' analysis, Bush's popularity
with women voters is based largely on a perception that the Texas
governor has improved education in his state. ``They don't know
much about him except that,'' she said. And nothing ranks higher
than education among women voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already called for ``revolutionary'' changes to improve
the public school system. But how does that get transformed from a
stump speech applause line into a campaign message that grabs
voters? ``That's what Celinda does best,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Lake has to figure out how to pull back seniors from
Bush. In the ``Battleground'' poll, voters age 60 to 69 favored
Bush over Gore by 18 points. And surprisingly, the top issue to
these seniors was not Social Security, as in the past, but values
and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Lake traces this development to the aging of Reagan Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voter who was 45 years old when Ronald Reagan was first
elected (in 1980) is going to be 65 in the 2000 presidential
election,'' she said. ``The Roosevelt seniors are dead. We've got
the Truman and Kennedy seniors, but the Reagan seniors are very
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's conduct in office has helped to sway these seniors to
Bush, but Lake thinks Gore has the opportunity to reverse that
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has some independent credibility on values,'' she said.
``He has established himself with these voters as having more faith
in God than the average Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore, a former seminarian, has called for government
subsidies for faith-based organizations to help with social welfare
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Lake believes the congressional Republicans' tax cuts and their
``lock box'' approach to Social Security reform are aimed primarily
at seniors. ``They've done a terrific job of targeting seniors,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a credible counter for Gore: He can warn that the
tax cuts could drain the budget surplus and jeopardize Social
Security. ``I tell Democrats don't be against the lock box. But we
don't want to lock an empty box,'' Lake said.

U.S. TO PAY $4.5 MILLION TO COMPENSATE VICTIMS OF CHINESE EMBASSY
BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SETH FAISON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The United States and China agreed here Friday that
Washington will pay $4.5 million to compensate the victims of
NATO's May 7 bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement removes one of the biggest obstacles to improved
relations between Washington and Beijing. Several sensitive issues
_ Taiwan and trade, above all _ remain on the table as the two
countries prepare for the Asia Pacific Economic Conference in New
Zealand in September. President Clinton and China's president,
Jiang Zemin, are scheduled to attend that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   David Andrews, a legal adviser to the State Department who led
the American side in the negotiations, said Friday's agreement
reflected what he called ``the critical importance of the
U.S.-China relationship.'' Andrews said the money would be paid as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement does not resolve questions about compensation for
property damage to the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade or to the U.S.
Embassy and consulates in China in days of violent protest
following the bombing. Talks on property damage will begin in late
August, Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said the Chinese government would decide how the
compensation will be divided among the families of the three people
who were killed and 27 who were wounded. China will also distribute
the money.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said in Washington that the agreement was an ``important step in
putting this issue behind us and mending the relationship with
Beijing _ obviously it's very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombing was viewed by Chinese leaders and citizens alike as
a grave affront to national dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled meetings on human rights, security issues and China's
effort to join the World Trade Organization were all postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Following the bombing, China's leaders adopted a stern line in
all contacts with the United States. They demanded a full apology,
a detailed accounting on how the bombing occurred and punishment
for those responsible as conditions to restoring normal ties.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Beijing's official position is that Washington's
explanation _ that the bombing was caused by faulty planning and
poor intelligence _ is insufficient. But American officials said
that in recent weeks they have detected efforts by Chinese
officials to find a way past their earlier, more confrontational
demands.
</P>
<P>
   China's state media gave wide coverage to phone calls that
President Clinton made to Jiang. The two presidents spoke when
teams from the two nations played each other in the Women's World
Cup Final on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   They conferred again last week after Taiwan's president, Lee
Teng-hui, infuriated Beijing with remarks widely interpreted as
nudging Taiwan closer to formal independence _ something China has
vowed to block with military force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Minor progress was made in the compensation talks, Andrews said.
Previously, China was unwilling to discuss compensation for damage
to the U.S. Embassy and consulates in China, arguing that it was
caused by student demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrews said Friday that Yin Yubiao, the Chinese Foreign
Ministry's director-general for treaties and law, agreed to hold
simultaneous discussions about compensation for damage to each
side's property.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews stressed Friday that the $4.5 million compensation
payment is voluntary and does not represent an admission of
liability on the part of the United States. Washington has insisted
that the bombing was unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``This payment will not create any precedents,'' Andrews said,
apparently to quell concern about possible claims against the
United States that might arise from future military action.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most pressing issue in the coming months will be
China's desire to enter the World Trade Organization. With limited
time in a complex schedule of hurdles that have to be crossed to
win U.S. support for China's entry to the organization, American
officials said the talks would have to restart before the September
summit between Clinton and Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   So far, China has been unwilling to resume negotiations. The
compensation talks had been considered the primary obstacle, but
American officials say they will not know until they actually sit
down again at a negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the official New China News Agency reiterated China's
position that the bombing was indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese side stressed that the U.S. bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia caused serious personnel casualties and
property losses and grossly violated the international law and the
norms governing the international relations,'' the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. side must bear all the responsibilities for this and
make immediate, adequate and effective compensations for all the
losses occurred to the Chinese side.''

BIOPURE IPO BRINGS $30 MILLION LESS THAN EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biopure Corp. had a rocky debut as a public company Thursday,
scaling back its stock offering and raising about $30 million less
than it had initially hoped to pay for clinical trials on a blood
substitute for humans.
</P>
<P>
   Biopure sold 3.5 million shares, 1 million fewer than the
Cambridge, Mass. company had planned, during its first public sale
of stock. The shares also sold at a slightly lower price than
anticipated. The deal, initially priced by Biopure's investment
bankers at $15.50 to $17.50 a share, sold at $12 each, raising $42
million.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech executives said it has become extremely difficult for
them to raise money, because they can't compete with Internet
stocks that are giving bigger _ and faster _ payoffs to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Biopure is among fewer than a handful of daring biotech firms
that have gone public this year, and analysts have been awaiting
its outcome for clues to the industry's ability to raise funds in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion: ``They did OK,'' Peter Feinstein, a consultant
with Feinstein Kean Partners Inc. in Boston, said Thursday.
``That's a lot of money. It's an average offering and it's the
middle of the summer and they did all right.''
</P>
<P>
   During Biopure's first day of trading under the symbol BPUR, the
stock closed at 10 1/4 a share, down 1 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing first day came amid a week that was generally
favorable for biotech companies. The American Stock Exchange's
Biotech Index came within a few points of its all-time high
Thursday, as some larger companies reported record second-quarter
profits and investors turned bullish on the industry's growth
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Biopure's offering will allow the company to pay off loans to
Pharmacia and Upjohn Inc. More importantly, Biopure will be able to
continue the costly clinical trials, now in their final stages, for
a blood substitute that would be useful, if successful, in
emergencies and during surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   The blood substitute, Hemopure, is a product that will be
pivotal to the company's success. A canine blood substitute
manufactured by Biopure is already on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very tough market for development-stage IPOs,''
said Katherine Martinelli, a vice president at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
in Boston. A scaled back IPO is ``not necessarily indicative of
anything inherent in the Biopure story.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Hammer, a managing direct of Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill, one
of Biopure's underwriters, said the decision to sell fewer shares
was made the day prior to the offering. He conceded that the
strength of the Internet stocks has made biotech a tougher story to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would've liked a higher price, but we're happy that we
successfully completed our offering and are a public company,''
said Doug Sayles, Biopure's spokesman.

TEAMSTERS SAY UPS NOT LIVING UP TO STRIKE SETTLEMENT PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
struck United Parcel Service of America Inc., angry members of a
dissident union group are demanding that the company adhere to a
contract requiring the creation of 10,000 full-time jobs over five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for full-time jobs was a major issue in the strike,''
noted Bob Machado, an organizer at Teamsters for a Democratic Union
in Detroit, a 10,000-member faction within the union that sent out
press releases Thursday announcing that the contract provision has
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned then that too many people were working
part-time with no chance of ever becoming full-time. We wanted to
create full-time jobs with full-time pay, but that is not
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS spokesman Robert Godlewski &UR;  &LR; said the company will not add
full-time jobs until it has recovered package volume lost in the
1997 strike. The company maintains package volume has dropped to
11.5 million packages per day worldwide, down from about 12 million
prior to the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Teamsters went on strike, the volume went down,''
said Godlewski. ``The contract clearly states that we have to be at
pre-strike package levels before we can create those full-time
jobs. We are not there. During the strike, people went to other
shippers.''
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters spokesman Bret &UR;  &LR; Caldwell said the union and the
company have been involved in arbitration over the matter for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   Under the contract signed after a bitter strike two years ago,
UPS agreed to add 2,000 full-time jobs annually by July 31, the
anniversary of the contract. A total of 10,000 full-time jobs were
to be created under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPS has continued to delay the implementation of the terms of
the contract,'' Caldwell said Thursday. He added that Teamsters
president James Hoffa is ``committed to making sure that UPS meets
the obligations required in the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The company employs 330,000 worldwide. Of those, 300,000 are in
the United States, and the vast majority are part-time workers.
``About 50 percent of the people who work in the hubs are
part-time,'' said Godlewski. ``That is the nature of the business.
These are people who work in four-hour stints, sorting packages and
documents on conveyors belts.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite lower package volume, UPS reported last week that
domestic packaging operating profits rose 17.5 percent to $878
million during the second quarter of this year, up from $747
million in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Atlanta-based company's net income rose 28.4
percent, an indication of strong profits and a healthy balance
sheet. UPS, privately held since its creation more than 90 years
ago, also has announced plans to create a publicly traded equity
security.
</P>
<P>
   Godlewski attributed the company's increased income to greater
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, during a speech at the Chief Executives Club of
Boston, UPS chief executive and chairman James P. Kelly said ground
volume was down 3.5 to 4 percent compared to pre-strike levels, but
ground delivery and international express had rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Kelly said the company was expecting significant
growth in the company's worlwide logistics business.

MILLOY LOOKS OVER THE FIELD AND DOESN'T LIKE WHAT HE SEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ A little background on Lawyer Milloy's anger
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people who has taught him more than anyone and whom
he's respected in his three years in the league _ Willie Clay _ was
cut by the Patriots Wednesday. Then, he sees his other friend, Ty
Law, trying to negotiate a huge contract extension _ for upwards of
seven years for more than $30 million and a signing bonus that
would be over $6 million _ while the Patriots have told him they
won't be able to do anything for him this year unless he agrees to
their deal, which Milloy feels is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Patriots) like the $490,000 cap number,'' said Ray
Anderson, Milloy's agent. ``They're trying to get Law done, and
they have told us they can't do anything for us this year.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Milloy, an All-Pro, a fiery, loyal kid who plays at 100
miles per hour every Sunday, was perturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Did he think the Patriots made the wrong decision?
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think? It's crazy,'' he said. ``How can you get
rid of someone who's played every single play for you? No matter
what everybody thinks. You're supposed to build around people you
can depend on. I don't care about one spectacular season somebody
had . . . you're depending on him coming back hurt and being
injured all the time every year (Willie McGinest?).
</P>
<P>
   ``You count on the people you can trust to be out there all the
time _ full go. I'm really upset right now. The way I play, I think
I've gained my respect from being out there every play, every snap,
barring injury. To lose somebody out there that I always want to go
to war with in the fourth quarter, not knowing he's going to be
there, is a big blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a good move. It hurts us. I hope we get through it,
but I don't understand it. Willie was out there every play when all
of our money guys were sitting on the bench. Management doesn't
understand that we go to war out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy left no prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids who wear everybody's jerseys, those are not the true
football players on our team. They let the true football players
go. It's getting ridiculous around here.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Patriots announced Clay's release, coach Pete Carroll
said he felt Milloy was ready to take the leadership role. Carroll
even said that his strong safety position and the free safety spot
could be interchangeable and that Milloy could wind up playing some
free safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in negotiations and they're contradicting
themselves,'' Milloy said. ``They're so quick to point out that
safeties are the lowest-paid positions. Now, I'm supposed to be the
leader and carry everybody?''
</P>
<P>
   Clay was touched by Milloy's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate that from Lawyer,'' said Clay Thursday. ``That
means a lot to me. He's a great young player who really appreciated
what we had and we were building with our defense. Lawyer wanted
everyone to stay in their own roles because that was the best way
for our team to be a champion. Unfortunately that didn't happen and
Lawyer is upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say this: I would have done the same for Lawyer or for Ty
if something had happened to them that happened to me. We were
close. We helped each other and I think Lawyer appreciates the help
I gave to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy was not alone in his dismay over Clay's release. Law was
as well. Both have spoken at length to Clay the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely don't want to see him go but whoever replaces
him, he'd better step up and we can't miss a beat,'' said Law.
</P>
<P>
   Law wasn't about to say much more in Clay's defense. He's in the
middle of sensitive negotiations with the Patriots that could earn
him a megadeal. Law's agent, Carl Poston, met with the Patriots
Thursday and again Thursday, and then left town without an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Law said he was not discouraged, but he did say, ``After
training camp, I appreciate not talking about it. I'm calling off
all negotiations. I can't afford to play ball and talk about
contracts. My focus has to be on Keyshawn Johnson, not on my
contract. I'm not discouraged at all. I've made decent money
anyway. Where I come from, that's a lot of money, but among my
peers, I'm probably not in the top 20. I thought I played as good
as anyone in the top 10 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully they'll come up with something. You want to keep the
best players on the field, but sometimes they let the best players
go. I've never asked for more money. I never said I was going to
hold out. I never asked for anything. I'm looking for big things.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said the deal will come down to the size of the signing
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always comes down to that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Law was peeved by the notion that because his deal hasn't been
restructured, the Patriots had to release his friend, Clay. ``I
don't understand that salary cap stuff,'' said Law. ``All I know
is, I've never asked for anything.''

LOOSE PIN LIKELY CAUSED HYDROGEN LEAK, NASA SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A hydrogen fuel leak on the space shuttle Columbia likely was
caused by a loose pin that was hurled from the shuttle's rocket
engines, NASA said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still a work in progress,'' NASA's Bill Gerstenmaier,
a shuttle program official, said of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstenmaier is coordinating the agency's investigation into the
leak and an electrical short that occurred five seconds after
Columbia lifted off. Had they worsened, either could have forced
Columbia's crew, led by Eileen Collins, the first woman spacecraft
commander, to attempt an unprecedented emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's five-day mission to deploy the $1.55 billion Chandra
X-ray Observatory ended successfully Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of Columbia's return to Earth, shuttle engineers
had confirmed their suspicions of a small fuel leak in the right
engine nozzle. They believe the leak contributed to a one second
early engine shutdown that left the Columbia in a slightly lower
orbit than intended.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstenmaier suspects a 7/8ths-inch-long, 1/8th-inch-wide, steel
alloy pin called an ``oxidizer port plug'' dislodged and flowed
into the right engine's combustion chamber. As it emerged in the
high-velocity exhaust flow, the gold-plated pin struck three of the
more than 1,000 stainless steel cooling tubes that line the nozzle
of the engine. The pin was missing after the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears pretty conclusively that we were impacted by some
type of debris,'' said Gerstenmaier as he referred to a series of
photographs taken of the damaged cooling lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see is evidence of an impact that scraped away some
of the metal or pushed some of the metal and thinned it out enough
that the tube could no longer hold pressure,'' he said. ``The tubes
ruptured, creating the three holes we see.''
</P>
<P>
   In a diagonal line about the length of three dimes placed side
by side, the holes in the damaged cooling tubes correspond to a
previously computed leak rate of five pounds of hydrogen a second,
NASA said.
</P>
<P>
   Film of the liftoff taken by launch pad cameras also shows a
bright flash in the nozzle, though engineers were not sure Friday
whether it was caused by the impact of the pin or with the first
flow of hydrogen from the leak.
</P>
<P>
   Pins of the kind under suspicion are used by shuttle rocket
engine technicians to plug fouled ports in the powerheads of the
combustion chamber. More than 600 of the ports channel liquid
oxygen propellent into the chamber where it is combined with
hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Columbia's right rocket engine, two of the ports
had been plugged prior to the flight, said George Hobson, a
propulsion expert from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. Though
seldom used, the plugs permit an engine with a slight flaw in a
port to be used, Hobson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandra telescope was the heaviest payload every taken to
orbit by a space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   In order to accommodate the observatory, the weight of Columbia
was reduced by several thousand pounds. Shuttle managers decided to
contribute to the weight savings by using older rocket engines,
models without safer but heavier propellant pumps and combustion
components.
</P>
<P>
   All three of Columbia's main engines were older. The right
engine was the oldest, having been used in 18 launches, the first
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not say that we tried to run this engine too long,''
he said. ``We have very strict criteria on how long we use an
engine and in what condition we can use it in. We very carefully
review these engines prior to flight,'' said Gerstenmaier. ``These
were perfectly acceptable to use and more middle of the road even
than some of the other engines we have flown.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA said it was too early to determine whether the next shuttle
flight, scheduled for a mid-September liftoff, would be affected by
the findings.

ARAB STRAINS SEDUCE COMPOSER INTO BELLY DANCING

 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You are a female composer in a male-dominated world. Your work
is played by some of the best musicians of your time, Emanuel Ax,
Ani Kavafian, Peter Serkin, Andre-Michel Schub and Richard Goode.
Yet contemporary music seems too hard-edged, too intellectual,
without soul. Your femininity is somehow ... unacknowledged. So
what do you do?
</P>
<P>
   You become a belly dancer, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Christine Berl did. After the commissions and the
praise from several reviewers, including those of The Los Angeles
Times, which called her music ``lyrical and melodious,'' and The
New York Times, which called it ``affectionately pianistic and yet
dignified in its bare outlines and austere tones.'' Ms. Berl threw
it all over to become a belly dancer in Arab nightclubs in New
York, Morocco, Barcelona and Milan.
</P>
<P>
   There, Ms. Berl's professional name is Touta, which is derived
from the Arab word ``raspberry.'' She took it as a favor to one of
her teachers who suggested it, she said. She dons the belly
dancer's costume, a heavily beaded bra and belt, a skirt and a
veil. Beginning to dance, she casts the veil aside. She contracts
her stomach, vibrates her hips, undulates her arms in snakelike
motions and gives her posterior a subtle quiver. But there is
nothing kitschy about her performance. Ms. Berl, who is in her
mid-50s, is a practitioner of classical belly dancing, which at its
best has the grace and dignity of ballet. Her style is somewhat
restrained, Ms. Berl said, ``but with a call toward a deeper
eroticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when she is in New York, Ms. Berl runs into
colleagues from the music world, prestigious figures who have
championed her, but she deliberately does not say hello. And
neither do they, she said. ``I see them all the time, Manny, Schub,
Peter, on Broadway,'' she said of Ax, Schub and Serkin. ``It's as
if we've reached an agreement. We pass each other on the street
without acknowledgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Odd as Ms. Berl's transition from composer to belly dancer might
seem, some of her friends see it as a logical development. ``Here
is a highly intelligent, sophisticated woman who was a very good
composer,'' said her friend Noa Ain, also a composer. ``She had
something to say in an original voice.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, ``the frustration, the hours alone, the
stillness of the occupation'' and the lack of appreciation defeated
her friend, she said. ``In her case, she had danced for years,''
Ms. Ain said. ``She had studied ballet, she was interested in
ethnic music.'' Belly dancing was not such a strange choice, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berl started out as a pianist, something of a child prodigy.
By the time she was 9, she was studying counterpoint and harmony.
Among her teachers were Hugo Weisgall, George Perle, Yehudi Wyner
and her father, Paul Berl.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Ms. Berl was pushed by her parents to study the
piano, but she also took ballet lessons and loved them. Eventually
she won a full scholarship to Mannes College of Music in piano.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berl began her career doing freelance work as a pianist
giving recitals and teaching. ``But I was not going anywhere,'' she
said. She decided to become a composer. ``I thought if I wrote it
myself, I would be more involved.''
</P>
<P>
   She married three times, she said. Her third husband is Martino
Rizzotti, a novelist, journalist and one of the founders of the
Italian-American newspaper, America Oggi . Ms. Berl has two sons,
Paul, 21, from her second marriage, and Tommaso, 16.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was through Rizzotti, she said, that she became interested in
belly dancing. In 1981 he brought home a tape of Arab music. She
was so drawn to the music, to its vibrancy and sensuality, she
said, that she began studying belly dancing in her free time from
composing, finding much in common between it and ballet.
</P>
<P>
   As she found herself more involved, she also seemed to be coming
into her own as a composer. In 1988 Ax played her piece ``Elegy''
at the Ravinia Fall Festival in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was very beautiful, very sad,'' Ax said in a
telephone interview. He compared its style to ``one of Schoenberg's
early pieces, Opus 11, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center commissioned a
composition from Ms. Berl, which she called ``Dark Summer,'' with
words from Louise Bogan's poem ``The Blue Estuaries.'' It had its
premiere in 1989, at Alice Tully Hall, with mezzo-soprano Frederica
von Stade singing.
</P>
<P>
   But all along, Ms. Berl said, her music was different from the
cool minimalism that prevailed among young composers. She was
composing in the tradition of Debussy and Bartok: delicate, lyrical
work filled with emotion. ``It was highly decorative,'' she said.
``It made use of internal cycles. It was very much oriented to
non-Western Indian music,'' Ms. Berl said. In ``Dark Summer,'' for
instance, she used Japanese music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cared about beauty,'' Ms. Berl said. But the problem was
``the notion of beauty has been removed from the esthetic realm.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 Serkin commissioned eleven composers to write pieces for
him. Ms. Berl was the only woman. He performed them at the 92nd
Street Y. In 1990 the Y devoted an evening to Ms. Berl's work. Ms.
Kavafian and Goode, Serkin, Schub and Ax played five world
premieres: ``And How but That a Life Was but a Flower,'' for a
capella chorus, had words by Henry Weinfield, her second husband;
``The Violent Bear It Away,'' an orchestral piece, with words from
a southern Baptist hymn, ``I'm Going Thro', Jesus'' was inspired by
Flannery O'Connor's novel. There was a cello piece ``Ballade,''
played by Matt Heimovitz. Schub played ``Sonata Quasi una
Fantasia.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Kozinn, writing in The Times, praised the ``well-developed
compositional imagination.'' Still, he criticized some of the
pieces for a ``grim earnestness.'' But, despite the favorable
reviews, Ms. Berl said she felt she was swimming upstream. ``There
were few other men that have had five premieres at the 92nd Street
Y by world-famous artists. Yet I was not getting performances,
grants or commissions,'' Ms. Berl said. Indeed, it was a time when
there were few women even composing at all. ``I felt they didn't
know what to do with me,'' she said of the music establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ignored,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, she said, is that ``Modern, western music has very
serious problems acknowledging the expressivity of the body,'' she
said. ``It's hard for women to disassociate from the body.'' But
the exotic rhythms and tones of Arab music seemed profoundly
sensual.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 came an epiphany. Pierre Amoyal and Jeremy Menuhin
commissioned her to write a violin sonata. The Palestinian
violinist and oud player, Simon Shaheen was also planning to play
it, she said. Ms. Berl called the piece, ``Masmoudi,'' and based it
on an Arabic rhythm. ``I thought `I don't want to write this,'''
she said. `I want to dance it.'''
</P>
<P>
   She stopped composing and began belly dancing in clubs in
Southern Europe and Morocco, studying with Sohar Zaki, a female
Egyptian belly dancer in Cairo, and a teacher, Yousry Sharif, a
male, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be an artist and enjoy being a woman,'' she said. ``I
just wanted to be a belly dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   She has destroyed most of the artifacts from her career as a
composer, including most of the reviews, keeping only a few tapes.
Some of her music has been published in Italy and a CD has been
issued there, she said, but nothing in the United States. ``I felt
so good,'' she said of destroying her files. ``And I had more
closet space too.''
</P>
<P>
   She is setting up a belly dancing school in Milan. She insists
that age is not a problem, at least in the Middle East. ``Belly
dancing, to really be exquisite, is about the sexuality of a mature
woman and not a of a girl,'' she said. ``In order for it really to
have depth it has to be backed up by a lot of experience.'' Indeed,
in the Arab world dancers like Nagwa Fouad, who is believed to be
well over 50, and Fifi Abdou, thought to be over 40, draw large
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berl says she also likes being a Jew in an Arab culture. She
says that when she performs in Morocco, she does not hide the fact
that she is Jewish, unless she is dancing in an area where there is
a strong fundamentalist presence. Her father's family was
originally from Palestine, she noted. ``It's all Semitic. It's all
the same. It's terrible we're not brothers.'' Belly dancing, Ms.
Berl said, is ``my little gesture of peace.''

   ATLANTA _ Thursday's shootings shined an unwanted light on a
high-stakes way to make it or break it: day-trading.
</P>
<P>
   The man identified as the shooter, Mark Barton, was a day
trader. He had lost a total of $105,000 over a period of 15 days,
ending July 27 at one of the two day trading establishments he
used.
</P>
<P>
   A number of eye witnesses to the shootings said Barton talked
about losing money while he was shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, traders bantering in chat rooms discussed the shootings.
One posting asked whether ``the wild risks and intense pressures of
market speculation'' were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Atlanta killings are not surprising'' said another member
of the Lakeside Trading Club. ``It was only a matter of time before
someone who blew out their account couldn't handle the stress and
took it out on innocent victims.''
</P>
<P>
   However, James Lee, president of Momentum Securities where
Barton traded as late as Tuesday, said Friday in a statement that
Barton had _ as all traders do _ signed documents saying he
understood the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to remember, the trading decisions he made
were his own,'' said Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Day-trading is not investing, it's more speculative than that.
</P>
<P>
   It is an intricately complex way to try to stay a split-second
ahead of the direction of a stock price. Day-traders feed off a
stock's volatile intraday movement. The shares most often traded
are technology stocks, most of which are on the Nasdaq market,
which processes trades electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders typically work out of places like All-Tech
Investment Group and Momentum Securities, the Atlanta businesses
where Barton traded. These companies provide staff to help the
traders and dedicated computers loaded with software on which to
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The typical day trader tends to focus on a handful of companies
and to buy and sell those stocks many times in a single session to
take advantage of spikes in the prices. At the end of the day, the
trader cashes out, returning the next day to roll the dice again.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Bourquin, a 30-year old California day-trader, said traders
get a feel for a stock's direction by watching what market makers
do.
</P>
<P>
   Market makers are brokerage firms that keep an inventory in a
particular stock to sell to customers. They buy or sell stock to
keep an orderly market. Watching the market makers, lets traders
like Bourquin stay a step ahead of the general public. That step
might be only a few-minute lead, but for a day-trader, who can make
a trade in a second, a minute is plenty.
</P>
<P>
   The losses and gains can be huge, but almost all traders lose
money in their first few months, Borquin said. The ones who last a
year tend to make a living, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bourquin, like many day-traders, worried that the actions of one
man would stain an industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew people would try and make this a day-trader thing,''
Bourquin said. ``But it probably had nothing to do with it, or very
little. This guy was just a lunatic. He could have been a mechanic
or a doctor. What happened in Atlanta has more to do with him being
a lunatic than him being a day-trader.''
</P>
<P>
   How difficult is day-trading? Here are some answers to commonly
asked questions about day-trading, compiled with the help of David
Floyd, a partner at San Diego-based careerdaytrader.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do day traders know which way a stock will go?
</P>
<P>
   A: They don't. Many day traders, however, keep a keen eye on S&AMP;P
futures. The reason? The prices of these tradeable futures
contracts and the actual index normally shadow each other quite
closely. When the gap between the futures and the index narrows or
widens, day traders see this as a buy or sell signal. Successful
day traders rarely bet against this market gauge. They buy shares
when the futures suggest the market will rise. Sometimes they're
right. Sometimes they're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the attraction of day trading?
</P>
<P>
   A: Consider the case of IBM, which fell $3 on Thursday to close
at $125.38. A normal investor who owned 100 shares of IBM lost
$300. But a day trader could have ``shorted'' 100 shares of IBM --
a bet that the stock would fall, and the only strategy to follow on
a day when the S&AMP;P 500 was falling -- until it reached its lowest
point. That day trader could have made as much as $400.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the risks of day-trading?
</P>
<P>
   A: Enormous. Investing is inherently risky. Day-trading is
extreme investing and can be extremely risky. Doing it without
proper training is folly, especially if you buy or sell on margin
(with borrowed funds), which geometrically increases the impact of
unexpected market events. This is not the way to invest your
retirement savings or bet next month's mortgage payment.

 &HT;    Psychologist said Barton capable of 1993 killings
 &HT;    By Jane O. Hansen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Soon after the September 1993 murders of Mark Barton's
first wife and her mother, a Cobb County, Ga., psychologist who had
interviewed him told state officials that Barton was capable of
committing the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall it as if it were yesterday,'' Douglas County District
Attorney David McDade said Friday, ``because he said it was his
opinion that Mr. Barton was capable of homicidal acts and thoughts.
Ideations is the word I think he used.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton was the chief suspect in the Labor Day murders, but no
charges were ever brought by Alabama authorities, who had legal
jurisdiction in the case. This week Barton went on a killing spree
in Buckhead and Stockbridge that claimed 13 lives, including his
own by suicide, in the biggest mass murder in Georgia history.
</P>
<P>
   McDade said that in February 1994 the psychologist, whom he
would not name, had called in his findings to a social worker with
the Douglas Department of Family and Children Services. The agency
had consulted the psychologist after receiving a complaint that
Barton may have sexually abused his daughter Mychelle, then about 2
1/2. A day care worker had reported the alleged abuse less than
four months after the bodies of the child's mother and grandmother
_ Debra Spivey Barton and Eloise Powell Spivey _ had been found in
a bloody trailer at Weiss Lake in Alabama, McDade said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, 7-year-old Mychelle, her 11-year-old brother
Matthew and Barton's second wife, Leigh Ann, were also found dead
in their Stockbridge, Ga., apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The psychologist said nothing in his written report about his
suspicions, McDade and child welfare officials said. His only
written observations about Barton were that he appeared, ``perhaps
understandably, irritated by the insistent suspicion of authority
figures and by these new allegations of possible sexual abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He appeared somewhat controlling, power oriented and very
suspicious,'' the psychologist wrote. ``He appears to have been
irritated by living in a household with a woman he considered much
brighter than he and a woman around whom he felt he had to be
`perfect.''' Upon hearing of their deaths Thursday, a distraught
Cathy Bitterman, the social worker involved in the case five years
ago, called McDade. ``She said, 'David, David, David, we knew
it,''' McDade said, quoting Bitterman. ``'Do you remember what the
doctor said?' I said, 'Oh yes, I remember it very well.' ``
Bitterman could not be reached Friday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But according to her notes from a 1994 telephone call, Bitterman
wrote that Barton was angry he was being investigated as a possible
child molester. He also referred to his first wife's murder. ``He
stated that he was home with his kids when his wife was murdered,''
Bitterman wrote. ``But law enforcement treated him like a 'ghetto
nigger,' and that is also the way he described being treated by
DFCS (Department of Family and Children Services).''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the psychologist's evaluations of the two children, the
allegation of sexual abuse was ruled out, said Peg Peters, director
of the state Division of Family and Children Services. ``There was
no evidence to support it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual abuse, especially involving a very young child, is often
tricky to prove if there is no physical evidence. Social workers
often seek the outside evaluation of a professional to guide them
in their investigation. According to McDade, the day care worker
had reported to the child welfare agency that the child had told
her ``her daddy played with her boo-boo.'' Asked what she meant,
the child pointed to her vaginal area, McDade said.
</P>
<P>
   Once child protective services workers ruled out sexual abuse,
they closed their case. But, McDade said, he remained interested in
the psychologist's statement that Barton was capable of murder.
``Everybody in this community knew that Mr. Barton was the prime
suspect in the murder (of his first wife and mother-in-law). So it
wasn't like a new revelation, but it confirmed our gut feeling. It
was just another piece of circumstantial evidence to add to the
mix.''
</P>
<P>
   And he defended the decision by the Department of Family and
Children Services to close the case. Bitterman, he said, is ``an
excellent DFCS worker. She's as good as they come. She lives and
breathes these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Goldberg, communications director for the Department of
Human Resources, said Bitterman had no choice but to close the case
because there was no evidence of sexual abuse. ``We had no way
legally to keep the case open,'' Goldberg said. ``She did the right
thing. She told law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the agency did not remain involved with the children
after hearing their father was capable of murder, Goldberg said the
psychologist never put his suspicions in writing. ``He did not go
on the record on that,'' she said. ``It was one of those
heart-to-heart kind of things. You know, 'I find nothing to
substantiate the sexual abuse, but I'll tell you what I feel.' If
he'd had a professional opinion, he would have put that in
writing.''
</P>
<P>
   The psychologist's written report instead focused on the sexual
abuse allegations, which he said were unsubstantiated. He said
Mychelle had been traumatized by the deaths of her mother and
grandmother and the suspicion that her father was their murderer.
</P>
<P>
   McDade refused to criticize prosecutors in Alabama for not
charging Barton with the 1993 killings. Douglas County law
enforcement had helped in the investigation because the victims
lived there. Richard Igou, former district attorney in Cherokee
County, Ala., said Wednesday there was no forensic evidence, but
McDade said there was some, just not much.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when investigators examined Barton's car, they had
sprayed it with Luminol _ a chemical that reacts with enzymes in
the blood. A positive reaction indicated blood on the brake pedal,
McDade said, but not enough to do further genetic testing to
determine whose blood, or even if it was human.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not questioning their decision at all,'' McDade said about
Alabama authorities. ``I think at best it was a circumstantial case
and circumstantial cases are always very difficult.''

MIT WITHDRAWS DIPLOMA OF BINGE-DRINKING LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has
withdrawn the diploma of the fraternity member accused of leading
the forced drinking binge that caused the 1997 death of pledge
Scott Krueger.
</P>
<P>
   The diploma will be reinstated after five years, the institute
said. But an attorney for the fraternity member said his client,
who graduated from MIT 14 months ago, intends to go to graduate
school and will sue to have the diploma reinstated immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternity member, 23-year-old Charles Yoo, was dubbed the
``pledge trainer'' during the event where Krueger went into an
alcohol-induced coma.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger started drinking the night of Sept. 27, 1997, at a party
at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity in the Fenway. During the party,
according to the Suffolk County district attorney's office, Yoo
told Krueger and the other 11 pledges at the fraternity to watch
the film ``Animal House,'' the 1978 comedy about a raucous
fraternity, then drink beer and a bottle of Jack Daniels. The
pledges were then told to go in a room where their ``big brothers''
presented them with a bottle of alcohol and told them to drink it,
according to the district attorney's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After drinking his bottle of spiced rum, Krueger complained of
nausea and was carried to his bed. When he was found later, he had
choked on his vomit. He was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center, where he went into a coma and died 40 hours later. His
blood alcohol level was five times the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk County District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II sued the
fraternity a year later. But the fraternity's Boston chapter had
already dissolved, and the district attorney's office acknowledged
that the case was moot without a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The event prompted MIT, which had long relied on fraternities to
deal with a shortage of dormitory space, to announce plans to build
a new dorm and require freshmen to live on campus.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, under fire after reports that it ignored
students' warnings about excessive drinking at the fraternity,
voted to withdraw Yoo's diploma after a hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo's lawyer, Timothy Burke, said his client apologized at the
hearing. But Burke also said the institute had relied only on
hearsay in laying the blame on Yoo. The institute said Yoo provided
the alcohol and coerced the students to drink; Burke said MIT
provided no evidence that his client bought the liquor. Several
pledges, he said, also said there was no pressure to drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected that at the hearing, there would be some semblance
of fairness,'' Burke said, ``There was a complete lack of due
process.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT refused to comment on the case, saying student discipline
matters are confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said he was not certain it was legal for MIT to withdraw
the diploma and that his client, now a stockbroker in Pennsylvania,
would likely sue to win it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a young man's life,'' he said. ``He's very bright,
very capable, and he never intended for this to happen. The
practical effect is, he's unable to continue his education.''
</P>
<P>
   James Borghesani, a spokesman for Martin said Thursday that his
office had no role in MIT's investigation of Yoo, and no role in
the school's decision to yank Yoo's diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether MIT's disciplinary action against Yoo effectively
brings an end to the case, Borghesani demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they'll ever be closure,'' he said. ``When an
incident involves a family member who dies, there is never
closure.''

RONALD PERELMAN, A MAN OF FEW WORDS, UNCLENCHES HIS TEETH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Sunday, August 1) 
(DW) 
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The scorekeepers of the world might credit Ronald
Owen Perelman with having it all. A net worth of $4.2 billion, by
Forbes' last count. Palatial residences in Manhattan, East Hampton
and Palm Beach wallpapered with modern art. A jet, a yacht, all the
toys and now, Ellen Barkin _ the sultry 45-year-old actress who is
expected to become his fourth wife.
</P>
<P>
   For these riches, the very private Perelman, 56, has paid an
expensive public price. Many of his business and personal affairs
have ended in courtroom dramas. Because he almost never gives
interviews, his image has often been defined by his foes as that of
a volatile, womanizing corporate raider who budgeted his daughter's
diet at $3 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of misperceptions out there about me,
you know?'' he said in an interview in his office at MacAndrews &AMP;
Forbes, the holding company for his financial empire.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman is a complex, contradictory character. He hates the
press but can't seem to keep out of tabloid trouble, whether by
offering Monica Lewinsky a job or by giving New York's police
commissioner a private jet ride to the Oscars. He is obsessed with
his personal safety but goes out all the time, usually with highly
photogenic companions. His aura of maximum-security inaccessibility
only makes him more intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes I have been more mysterious than need be,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   After years of near silence, he now seems motivated to
straighten a few things out about his sometimes unflattering public
image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do take a fat picture, but I've got a 28-inch waist!'' he
exclaimed. He wore a pair of tapered khakis and a neatly tucked-in
polo shirt. Short he is; fat he is not.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Perelman was certain enough that he and Ms. Barkin
are getting married to name a wedding date of Dec. 1. Perelman
would confirm none of this _ not even that he and Ms. Barkin are
engaged. Asked if his pursuit of her had intensified, as one
bystander speculated, after Ms. Barkin took a younger man as her
date to Vanity Fair's Oscar party in March, Perelman declined to
discuss how they met or when the relationship began, except to say,
``We've known each other for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Best known for steaming up the scenery with Al Pacino in their
1989 movie, ``Sea of Love,'' Ms. Barkin is, for men of a certain
age, the ultimate sex symbol. The current cover of Smoke, a
quarterly for cigar aficionados, has her puffing a stogie above the
words ``powerfully sexy.'' Perelman is another famous cigar
chomper, and the reception area at MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes is stocked
with copies of Smoke.
</P>
<P>
   An audience with Perelman was granted with the stipulation that
it be an off-the-record discussion, only some of which could be
quoted on the record. James T. Conroy, a MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes vice
president who advises Perelman on public relations, took notes
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   This extreme wariness extends well beyond the town house from
which he controls 83 percent of Revlon Inc. and the rest of a
diverse empire that includes Technicolor, the film-processing
company, and a California savings and loan association that won a
$909 million settlement in April from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous friends, foes and former wives declined to speak for
attribution, citing their fear of arousing Perelman's displeasure.
``You have no idea how powerful he is,'' said a former household
employee who, like everyone on the Perelman payroll, signed a
confidentiality agreement.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Perelman may be lifting the code of silence now is
the war with Patricia Duff over their daughter, Caleigh, 4. When
their child support trial resumes next week, the headlines likely
will, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duff's beauty is matched by her facility with the news
media. Lately he has begun some counterspin of his own, counseled
by Conroy and high-powered public-relations Richelieus like Howard
Rubenstein and John Scanlon. Perelman wants to offset the image
that he said his former wife has disseminated of him as a
``domineering, manipulative, controlling, horrendous human being.''
</P>
<P>
   A profile of Ms. Duff, who declined to comment for this article,
appeared in the August issue of Vanity Fair, featuring some
surprisingly unguarded remarks by Perelman. ``She looks at you with
those eyes,'' he told the magazine. ``And she looks great, and she
moves great, and she smells great, and she sounds great. And I
thought, this is great.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last round of media coverage, Perelman was pilloried for
telling a lawyer for Ms. Duff that he could feed Caleigh on a few
dollars a day _ a remark he regrets making, but still will not say
was wrong. Friends portray him as a devoted father, especially to
his 9-year-old daughter with Claudia Cohen, Samantha, with whom he
vacationed in Europe two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the great socializers of all time,'' one of his
former wives said. Whether it's the recent 40th-anniversary party
for the Four Seasons restaurant _ which served as a kind of
coming-out party for him and Ms. Barkin _ or an invitation from the
hip-hop impresario Russell Simmons Perelman is there.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he showed up at the Four Seasons ``because of
Edgar,'' referring to Edgar Bronfman Jr., the Seagram Company
president, who owns the restaurant. ``And I went to the Russell
Simmons thing because of Russell. But I don't go to charity things
unless I'm obligated to, and I don't go to a lot of parties.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Such obligations are closely intertwined with Perelman's
tricoastal web of friends and associates in New York, Los Angeles
and Washington. He spreads campaign contributions on both sides of
the aisle. He recently attended a dinner that Hillary Rodham
Clinton held in Washington for the prime minister of Israel. It was
President Clinton's friend Vernon E. Jordan Jr., a Revlon board
member, who asked Mr. Perelman for a job for Ms. Lewinsky in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Society friends of Perelman say the media blow his night
crawling out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Stern, the chairman of the Hartz pet food and real
estate empire, has known Perelman for 25 years and takes a similar
view. ``This is no playboy,'' Stern said. ``The opposite doesn't
mean you have to lead a boring life. He enjoys going out at night
for two hours _ fine!''
</P>
<P>
   John Sykes, the president of VH-1, recalled that after having
dinner in East Hampton with his wife, Perelman, Rod Stewart and
Rachel Hunter, Perelman invited everyone back to the Creeks, his
$25 million Hamptons home, to watch ``The Mask of Zorro'' in his
screening room, only to retire to bed almost as soon as the movie
started, leaving his guests reclining in their chaise longues. ``So
there I am lying next to Rod . . . '' Sykes said, still a little
perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and Sykes are part of Perelman's aging rocker circle.
``He and I are both frustrated drummers,'' Sykes said. During
parties at Jimmy Buffett's house in the Hamptons, Perelman has been
known to get behind the drums and keep time for the likes of
Stewart and Billy Joel.
</P>
<P>
   A world he seems less interested in jamming with is the
high-society circuit adopted by many tycoons, often at the urging
of their socially ambitious wives. ``You won't see Ronald in a box
next to Mercedes Bass at opening night of the Metropolitan Opera,''
a close friend said. Perelman agreed. ``That kind of visibly social
activity has never interested me,'' he said, his gruff voice still
inflected with the vowels of his native Philadelphia.

WELFARE CLAIMS IN BAY STATE DROP FOR 71ST MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts had fewer than 50,000 families on
welfare this month, the smallest number in nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the welfare caseload dropped for the 71st consecutive
month to 49,711 families, a low not seen since the late 1960s,
according to the Department of Transitional Assistance.
</P>
<P>
   DTA spokesman Dick Powers said the continuing caseload freefall
is the product not only of Massachusetts' roaring economy but also
its 4-year-old welfare reform law. It requires able-bodied adults
to work 20 hours a week to remain eligible for cash aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how we envisioned welfare reform would work at the
outset,'' Powers said. ``Namely, that able-bodied adults would get
off the rolls and go to work, leaving only those people who cannot
take care of themselves on the rolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor said, however, the ongoing caseload
decline offers no reason to rejoice.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Albelda, a University of Massachusetts labor economist who
specializes in poverty issues, said the state's own study of former
welfare families, released in April, found that nearly three out of
10 did not have jobs a year after leaving the rolls. And of those
who were working, half had incomes below the federal poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Albelda said a large number of families dropped off
the rolls in recent months not because they had jobs, but because
they were forced off under welfare reform's time limit on benefits.
The time limit prohibits families from receiving more than 24
months of cash assistance in a five-year period if they are headed
by able-bodied adults and the youngest child has reached age 2.
</P>
<P>
   When the time limit began taking effect in December, the
caseload was just under 59,000. Since then, according to DTA's
records, about 6,800 families have lost their benefits under time
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welfare sanction policies and welfare time limits have pushed
people off welfare,'' said Deborah Harris, a lawyer at the
Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. ``The question is into what?
These are the families with the most crises.''
</P>
<P>
   While DTA is in the midst of a long-term study of how those
families are faring, Powers said the welfare caseload has not
dropped faster since December than in previous months.
</P>
<P>
   As further evidence the law is working, Powers said that when
the reforms became law in February 1995, 22 percent of the 103,000
families on welfare were subject to the work-first requirement,
compared with only 9 percent today.

NEW YORK: native Philadelphia.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has given away more than $100 million. He donated $20 million
to the University of Pennsylvania, one of his alma maters. He is on
the board of the Guggenheim Museum. . A major supporter of the
Hasidic Lubavitcher sect, he bankrolled a Jewish girls' school in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman came to New York in 1978, with an M.B.A. from Wharton
and a $2 million stake in a jewelry company. He would use that
investment to buy MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes, a candy manufacturer whose
distinguished name he appropriated to open his assault on Wall
Street. A master of the junk-bond takeover universe in the 1980s,
he became better known for buying and selling companies than for
running them.
</P>
<P>
   After his leveraged buyout of the Marvel Entertainment Group,
the comic book publisher, in 1989, the company wound up in Chapter
11 and Perelman walked away $50 million richer. Revlon, for which
he paid $1.9 billion in 1985, is now estimated to be worth twice
that amount. He is openly seeking a buyer for all or part of the
company, whose shares and profits are lagging.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman is no stranger to litigation, lawsuits and countersuits
brought out of of personal and financial acrimony. In 1983, his
first wife, Faith Golding Perelman, took him to court over a
company whose ownership she claimed. In the case, Perelman was
represented by Roy Cohn; his wife, by the famously tough litigator
Stanley Arkin. Twelve years later, Perelman dismissed his chief
financial officer, Fred Tepperman, via fax while Tepperman was in
Florida on Christmas vacation caring for his ailing wife. Tepperman
sued. That time, Perelman hired Arkin to attack Tepperman's case as
he himself had been attacked a few years before.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Forbes listed Perelman's net worth at $180 million.
Since then, he has built a fief based in the side-by-side town
houses that contain his home and offices. ``The world revolves
around him,'' a former wife said. ``I've known a lot of powerful
people, wealthy people. I don't know anybody who has constructed a
whole world of his own. He is the boy in the bubble, he really is.
And he's manic about all of it. Living with him is like living with
a perpetual motion machine, which is how he stays very slim.''
</P>
<P>
   To secure this world, Perelman employs retired New York City
police officers and FBI men. He has been known to send armed
advance men to secure party sites before he arrives. A boater who
drifts too close to his waterfront property in East Hampton may be
rebuffed by a guard toting a submachine gun. A bitter point of
dispute with Ms. Duff has been the bodyguards who shadow Caleigh's
every move: he wants them, she doesn't. (Security was one of two
issues during the interview on which Perelman later refused to be
quoted. The other, the child support case, was kept off the record
at his lawyers' behest, Conroy said.)
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Ms. Duff, Perelman has managed to remain
on good terms _ or regain them _ with his former wives and
girlfriends. He is close to Ms. Cohen again, who won an $80 million
settlement after their nine-year marriage ended in 1994, and with
his former girlfriend Elizabeth Saltzman, Vanity Fair's fashion
director. Mr. Perelman does not tend to squire mere models and
beauty-contest winners. ``He needs a woman who's independent and
has a big personality,'' said Larry Gagosian, Perelman's primary
art dealer. ``Or he gets bored.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman who dated Perelman for several months described his
formidable attentiveness and persistence. ``He leaned over the
table in the middle of a business meeting at Cipriani and said, `I
want to date you,''' she recalled. ``He focuses on you very
intently. He's a great listener. And it's not like he tells you
what you want to hear. He lends advice in a very constructive way.
That's the seduction process.''
</P>
<P>
   Perelman can, women who have enjoyed his attentions say, be fun.
</P>
<P>
   Something worked on Ms. Barkin, who is separated from and in the
process of divorcing the actor Gabriel Byrne, with whom she has two
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very intelligent woman,'' said Harold Becker, who
directed her in ``Sea of Love.'' ``She's very strong-willed, and
she's her own person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barkin, through her publicity agent, refused requests for an
interview. But Gagosian, asked if Perelman had met his match, said,
``I don't know who I'd bet on in that one.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his immediate future with Ms. Barkin _ that is, whether
they were planning a trip to Europe together last week _ Perelman
would only squint his eyes suspiciously and ask, ``How do you know
where I'm going?''

MIT WITHDRAWS DIPLOMA OF BINGE-DRINKING LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has
withdrawn the diploma of the fraternity member accused of leading
the forced drinking binge that caused the 1997 death of pledge
Scott Krueger.
</P>
<P>
   The diploma will be reinstated after five years, the institute
said. But an attorney for the fraternity member said his client,
who graduated from MIT 14 months ago, intends to go to graduate
school and will sue to have the diploma reinstated immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternity member, 23-year-old Charles Yoo, was dubbed the
``pledge trainer'' during the event where Krueger went into an
alcohol-induced coma.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger started drinking the night of Sept. 27, 1997, at a party
at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity in the Fenway. During the party,
according to the Suffolk County district attorney's office, Yoo
told Krueger and the other 11 pledges at the fraternity to watch
the film ``Animal House,'' the 1978 comedy about a raucous
fraternity, then drink beer and a bottle of Jack Daniels. The
pledges were then told to go in a room where their ``big brothers''
presented them with a bottle of alcohol and told them to drink it,
according to the district attorney's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After drinking his bottle of spiced rum, Krueger complained of
nausea and was carried to his bed. When he was found later, he had
choked on his vomit. He was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center, where he went into a coma and died 40 hours later. His
blood alcohol level was five times the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk County District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II sued the
fraternity a year later. But the fraternity's Boston chapter had
already dissolved, and the district attorney's office acknowledged
that the case was moot without a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The event prompted MIT, which had long relied on fraternities to
deal with a shortage of dormitory space, to announce plans to build
a new dorm and require freshmen to live on campus.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, under fire after reports that it ignored
students' warnings about excessive drinking at the fraternity,
voted to withdraw Yoo's diploma after a hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo's lawyer, Timothy Burke, said his client apologized at the
hearing. But Burke also said the institute had relied only on
hearsay in laying the blame on Yoo. The institute said Yoo provided
the alcohol and coerced the students to drink; Burke said MIT
provided no evidence that his client bought the liquor. Several
pledges, he said, also said there was no pressure to drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected that at the hearing, there would be some semblance
of fairness,'' Burke said, ``There was a complete lack of due
process.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT refused to comment on the case, saying student discipline
matters are confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said he was not certain it was legal for MIT to withdraw
the diploma and that his client, now a stockbroker in Pennsylvania,
would likely sue to win it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a young man's life,'' he said. ``He's very bright,
very capable, and he never intended for this to happen. The
practical effect is, he's unable to continue his education.''
</P>
<P>
   James Borghesani, a spokesman for Martin said Friday that his
office had no role in MIT's investigation of Yoo, and no role in
the school's decision to yank Yoo's diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether MIT's disciplinary action against Yoo effectively
brings an end to the case, Borghesani demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they'll ever be closure,'' he said. ``When an
incident involves a family member who dies, there is never
closure.''

MILLOY LOOKS OVER THE FIELD AND DOESN'T LIKE WHAT HE SEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes time references thruout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ A little background on Lawyer Milloy's anger
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people who has taught him more than anyone and whom
he's respected in his three years in the league _ Willie Clay _ was
cut by the Patriots Wednesday. Then, he sees his other friend, Ty
Law, trying to negotiate a huge contract extension _ for upwards of
seven years for more than $30 million and a signing bonus that
would be over $6 million _ while the Patriots have told him they
won't be able to do anything for him this year unless he agrees to
their deal, which Milloy feels is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Patriots) like the $490,000 cap number,'' said Ray
Anderson, Milloy's agent. ``They're trying to get Law done, and
they have told us they can't do anything for us this year.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Milloy, an All-Pro, a fiery, loyal kid who plays at 100
miles per hour every Sunday, was perturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Did he think the Patriots made the wrong decision?
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think? It's crazy,'' he said. ``How can you get
rid of someone who's played every single play for you? No matter
what everybody thinks. You're supposed to build around people you
can depend on. I don't care about one spectacular season somebody
had . . . you're depending on him coming back hurt and being
injured all the time every year (Willie McGinest?).
</P>
<P>
   ``You count on the people you can trust to be out there all the
time _ full go. I'm really upset right now. The way I play, I think
I've gained my respect from being out there every play, every snap,
barring injury. To lose somebody out there that I always want to go
to war with in the fourth quarter, not knowing he's going to be
there, is a big blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a good move. It hurts us. I hope we get through it,
but I don't understand it. Willie was out there every play when all
of our money guys were sitting on the bench. Management doesn't
understand that we go to war out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy left no prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids who wear everybody's jerseys, those are not the true
football players on our team. They let the true football players
go. It's getting ridiculous around here.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Patriots announced Clay's release, coach Pete Carroll
said he felt Milloy was ready to take the leadership role. Carroll
even said that his strong safety position and the free safety spot
could be interchangeable and that Milloy could wind up playing some
free safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in negotiations and they're contradicting
themselves,'' Milloy said. ``They're so quick to point out that
safeties are the lowest-paid positions. Now, I'm supposed to be the
leader and carry everybody?''
</P>
<P>
   Clay was touched by Milloy's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate that from Lawyer,'' said Clay. ``That means a lot
to me. He's a great young player who really appreciated what we had
and we were building with our defense. Lawyer wanted everyone to
stay in their own roles because that was the best way for our team
to be a champion. Unfortunately that didn't happen and Lawyer is
upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say this: I would have done the same for Lawyer or for Ty
if something had happened to them that happened to me. We were
close. We helped each other and I think Lawyer appreciates the help
I gave to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy was not alone in his dismay over Clay's release. Law was
as well. Both have spoken at length to Clay the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely don't want to see him go but whoever replaces
him, he'd better step up and we can't miss a beat,'' said Law.
</P>
<P>
   Law wasn't about to say much more in Clay's defense. He's in the
middle of sensitive negotiations with the Patriots that could earn
him a megadeal. Law's agent, Carl Poston, met with the Patriots
Thursday and again Friday, and then left town without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Law said he was not discouraged, but he did say, ``After
training camp, I appreciate not talking about it. I'm calling off
all negotiations. I can't afford to play ball and talk about
contracts. My focus has to be on Keyshawn Johnson, not on my
contract. I'm not discouraged at all. I've made decent money
anyway. Where I come from, that's a lot of money, but among my
peers, I'm probably not in the top 20. I thought I played as good
as anyone in the top 10 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully they'll come up with something. You want to keep the
best players on the field, but sometimes they let the best players
go. I've never asked for more money. I never said I was going to
hold out. I never asked for anything. I'm looking for big things.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said the deal will come down to the size of the signing
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always comes down to that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Law was peeved by the notion that because his deal hasn't been
restructured, the Patriots had to release his friend, Clay. ``I
don't understand that salary cap stuff,'' said Law. ``All I know
is, I've never asked for anything.''

BIOPURE IPO BRINGS $30 MILLION LESS THAN EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes time references thruout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biopure Corp. had a rocky debut as a public company Friday,
scaling back its stock offering and raising about $30 million less
than it had initially hoped to pay for clinical trials on a blood
substitute for humans.
</P>
<P>
   Biopure sold 3.5 million shares, 1 million fewer than the
Cambridge, Mass. company had planned, during its first public sale
of stock. The shares also sold at a slightly lower price than
anticipated. The deal, initially priced by Biopure's investment
bankers at $15.50 to $17.50 a share, sold at $12 each, raising $42
million.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech executives said it has become extremely difficult for
them to raise money, because they can't compete with Internet
stocks that are giving bigger _ and faster _ payoffs to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Biopure is among fewer than a handful of daring biotech firms
that have gone public this year, and analysts have been awaiting
its outcome for clues to the industry's ability to raise funds in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion: ``They did OK,'' Peter Feinstein, a consultant
with Feinstein Kean Partners Inc. in Boston, said. ``That's a lot
of money. It's an average offering and it's the middle of the
summer and they did all right.''
</P>
<P>
   During Biopure's first day of trading under the symbol BPUR, the
stock closed at 10 1/4 a share, down 1 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing first day came amid a week that was generally
favorable for biotech companies. The American Stock Exchange's
Biotech Index came within a few points of its all-time high Friday,
as some larger companies reported record second-quarter profits and
investors turned bullish on the industry's growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   Biopure's offering will allow the company to pay off loans to
Pharmacia and Upjohn Inc. More importantly, Biopure will be able to
continue the costly clinical trials, now in their final stages, for
a blood substitute that would be useful, if successful, in
emergencies and during surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   The blood substitute, Hemopure, is a product that will be
pivotal to the company's success. A canine blood substitute
manufactured by Biopure is already on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very tough market for development-stage IPOs,''
said Katherine Martinelli, a vice president at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
in Boston. A scaled back IPO is ``not necessarily indicative of
anything inherent in the Biopure story.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Hammer, a managing direct of Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill, one
of Biopure's underwriters, said the decision to sell fewer shares
was made the day prior to the offering. He conceded that the
strength of the Internet stocks has made biotech a tougher story to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would've liked a higher price, but we're happy that we
successfully completed our offering and are a public company,''
said Doug Sayles, Biopure's spokesman.

BARRY MEYER, COO OF WARNER BROS., IS EXPECTED TO HEAD STUDIO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Barry M. Meyer, the chief operating officer at the
Warner Bros. studio, is expected to be promoted to the top
position, company executives said Friday. He would succeed Robert
A. Daly and Terry Semel, who ran the film, television and music
divisions for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another insider, Alan Horn, chairman and chief
executive at Castle Rock Entertainment, has emerged as a top
candidate to run Warner's movie division, rival studio executives
and talent agents said. Horn is a friend and former associate of
Ted Turner, vice chairman and 11 percent owner of the studio's
parent company, Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A Warner Bros. spokeswoman, Barbara Brogliatti, said no
decisions had been made about replacements for Daly and Semel, who
unexpectedly announced their resignations two weeks ago after an
enduring and generally successful partnership. But one senior
Warner Bros. executive said Meyer would soon be appointed to a top
job at the studio.
</P>
<P>
   In making known their decision to leave, Daly and Semel, who
have grown enormously wealthy, said they wanted to join forces as
entertainment entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion of Meyer, a low-keyed and respected lawyer who was
third in the studio's corporate command behind Daly and Semel,
would set off ripples across a studio that has been the most stable
one in Hollywood for decades.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, Meyer is not expected to have the full leverage of
Daly and Semel, who ran the studio, including the troubled music
division, with relative independence from Time Warner. Both Meyer
and Horn are expected to be less free-wheeling than their
predecessors, who also served under Gerald M. Levin, chairman of
Time Warner, as well as Turner.
</P>
<P>
   At another level, Meyer's promotion is expected to mark the
close of a somewhat flamboyant era at the studio started by Steven
J. Ross, the charismatic Time Warner chairman who died in 1992.
Daly and Semel, who were trained and guided by Ross, made
big-budget, often successful films, especially in the 1980s, and
were accustomed to spending lavishly on movies, producer and star
deals and perquisites. This is expected to end in the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer and Horn did not respond to phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, 55, has worked on the business side of Warner Bros. for
28 years and has most recently overseen the company's television
production and distribution operations. He is also in charge of
legal affairs and strategic planning. A top talent agent said that
several senior Warner Bros. executives, responsible for such key
areas as the studio's stores and home video operations, had lobbied
for Meyer's promotion.
</P>
<P>
   A top Wall Street entertainment financier said Meyer was an
impressive, if little-known, figure, at the studio. ``He's done a
world-class job building Time Warner's television business, their
most successful business,'' the financier said. ``People on Wall
Street, and in the film business, don't really know him. He's very
mature and level-headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Once appointed, Meyer would face, along with Levin, an immediate
decision on how to deal with the struggling music group, which has
fallen to fourth place from first among the five biggest recording
companies in sales of current albums in the nation. This year,
Seagam's Universal Music Group, Sony and the Bertelsmann Music
Group have surpassed Warner Bros. in album sales. Warner Bros.
music has been struggling overseas, too.
</P>
<P>
   Several rival executives and talent agents said they expected
Levin to separate the music division and overhaul it. The music
unit has never quite recovered from the executive turmoil of the
mid-1990s when it was run first by Robert Morgado and then Michael
Fuchs, the former Home Box Office chairman. Daly and Semel took
over the music division in 1996, but it has floundered and
executives there have been criticized as out-of-touch with audience
tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Horn, 56, has had a mixed track record at Castle Rock, a
television and film division of Warner Bros.. Castle Rock's most
notable and biggest success by far was ``Seinfeld,'' whose nearly
200 episodes will run in syndication for years and will generate
perhaps $1.5 billion in revenue for Castle Rock. But the company
has fared poorly in movies, after a strong start with ``When Harry
Met Sally,'' ``City Slickers'' and ``Misery.'' Flops include
``Ghosts of Mississippi,'' ``An American President'' and ``Strip
Tease.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting, then owned by Turner, acquired Castle Rock
in 1993. After Time Warner acquired Turner in 1996, Castle Rock was
put up for sale by Levin, Daly and Semel. No buyers would pay the
price. So Castle Rock wound up as a division of Warner Bros.
studio.

TEAMSTERS SAY UPS NOT LIVING UP TO STRIKE SETTLEMENT PACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes time references thruout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
struck United Parcel Service of America Inc., angry members of a
dissident union group are demanding that the company adhere to a
contract requiring the creation of 10,000 full-time jobs over five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for full-time jobs was a major issue in the strike,''
noted Bob Machado, an organizer at Teamsters for a Democratic Union
in Detroit, a 10,000-member faction within the union that sent out
press releases Friday announcing that the contract provision has
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned then that too many people were working
part-time with no chance of ever becoming full-time. We wanted to
create full-time jobs with full-time pay, but that is not
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS spokesman Robert Godlewski &UR;  &LR; said the company will not add
full-time jobs until it has recovered package volume lost in the
1997 strike. The company maintains package volume has dropped to
11.5 million packages per day worldwide, down from about 12 million
prior to the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Teamsters went on strike, the volume went down,''
said Godlewski. ``The contract clearly states that we have to be at
pre-strike package levels before we can create those full-time
jobs. We are not there. During the strike, people went to other
shippers.''
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters spokesman Bret &UR;  &LR; Caldwell said the union and the
company have been involved in arbitration over the matter for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   Under the contract signed after a bitter strike two years ago,
UPS agreed to add 2,000 full-time jobs annually by July 31, the
anniversary of the contract. A total of 10,000 full-time jobs were
to be created under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPS has continued to delay the implementation of the terms of
the contract,'' Caldwell said. He added that Teamsters president
James Hoffa is ``committed to making sure that UPS meets the
obligations required in the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The company employs 330,000 worldwide. Of those, 300,000 are in
the United States, and the vast majority are part-time workers.
``About 50 percent of the people who work in the hubs are
part-time,'' said Godlewski. ``That is the nature of the business.
These are people who work in four-hour stints, sorting packages and
documents on conveyors belts.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite lower package volume, UPS reported last week that
domestic packaging operating profits rose 17.5 percent to $878
million during the second quarter of this year, up from $747
million in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Atlanta-based company's net income rose 28.4
percent, an indication of strong profits and a healthy balance
sheet. UPS, privately held since its creation more than 90 years
ago, also has announced plans to create a publicly traded equity
security.
</P>
<P>
   Godlewski attributed the company's increased income to greater
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, during a speech at the Chief Executives Club of
Boston, UPS chief executive and chairman James P. Kelly said ground
volume was down 3.5 to 4 percent compared to pre-strike levels, but
ground delivery and international express had rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Kelly said the company was expecting significant
growth in the company's worlwide logistics business.

SENATE APPROVES $792 BILLION IN TAX CUTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate approved its $792 billion tax-cut plan
Friday, and the leaders of the House and Senate now plan to
negotiate a compromise measure before the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Senate approved the package by a 57 to
43 vote that was largely along party lines. The 10-year package
would hand U.S. taxpayers the most substantial tax break since the
Reagan cuts of 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate package, authored by Sen. William Roth, R-Del., would
reduce the tax bite for those in the lowest income tax bracket,
do-away with the so-called ``marriage penalty'' and exempt some
capital gains income from taxation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are entitled to relief,'' said Roth,
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. ``What we are doing here
is restoring the excess taxes that have already been paid.''
</P>
<P>
   But Roth's bill differs significantly from the tax plan authored
by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,
and passed last week by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Roth and Archer plan to meet Sunday to begin working out the
differences between their bills. They hope to craft a compromise,
and get approval from both houses before lawmakers leave for their
summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has repeatedly warned lawmakers he will veto
any tax reduction package of this magnitude. The White House wants
to limit tax cuts to no more than $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore on Friday compared the Senate bill to
``the trickle-down tragedies of the past,'' referring to derogatory
descriptions of the Reagan administration's 1980s tax cuts and the
idea that the money would ``trickle down'' to lower income people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leading economists agree that tax cuts of this magnitude, at a
time when the economy is so strong, is like putting lighter fluid
on white hot charcoals while the economy is cooking just fine,
thank you very much,'' Gore said. ``It could trigger up a dangerous
flare-up of inflation and singe the financial markets with higher
interest rates. And when the smoke clears, you've been burned.''
</P>
<P>
   With a presidential veto all but assured, lawmakers already are
gearing up for a new round of negotiations later this fall to pass
a tax reduction that will stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early in the process,'' noted House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected an effort led by Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, and backed by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., to push the Senate bill closer to Archer's version by
expanding the reductions in the tax brackets to all five tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would lower the 15 percent tax bracket _ the
rate currently levied on the first $25,750 of any single filer's
income and the first $43,050 for joint filers _ to 14 percent
starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's plan, however, would ratchet down all five income tax
brackets by 10 percent across the board over 10 years. His proposal
would reduce the 15 percent tax bracket to 13.5 percent, with the
first reduction to 14.85 percent coming in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill also would broaden the 15 percent tax bracket.
Starting in 2006, the total income taxed at that rate would rise by
$2,000 a year for singles and $4,000 a year for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these two changes would result in a tax savings of
about $450 a year for a family of four, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, Lott said lawmakers are leaning toward
accepting Archer's across-the-board approach in the conference
committee. Roth wouldn't predict how the conferees would act,
saying only ``I find great merit to both approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate overwhelmingly adopted an amendment sponsored by Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, that would offer quicker relief from
the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty slams dual-income working couples, forcing
them to pay more income taxes than they would if they were each
filing as singles. These two-income families also pay more than
families where there's only one breadwinner earning a comparable
salary.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's amendment, using language similar to that in the
House tax bill crafted by Archer, would raise the standard
deduction for married couples to twice that of singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of this country who want to get married shouldn't
have to pay a $1,000 (more) in taxes just because they got
married,'' Hutchison said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This measure would help an estimated 21 million couples,
including many families who don't face the marriage penalty now.
These couples would benefit from an increase in the standard
deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said many of those couples living on one income
deserve a break as well because they are taking care of children at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's amendment would kick in in 2001, although it would
not fully eliminate the marriage penalty. That would have to wait
until 2005, when a provision in Roth's original bill would take
effect doing away with penalty completely.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for earlier marriage penalty relief, lawmakers were
forced to delay other breaks in the tax bill to keep the cost below
the $792 billion ceiling. The broadening of the lowest tax bracket,
for example, was pushed back from 2005 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Senate bill goes further than the House measure to
fully eliminate the marriage penalty, the conference committee
negotiators are likely to move toward the Senate version on that
provision, Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Another amendment passed Friday was aimed at capital gains taxes
on profits on investments in stocks and other investments.
Conservatives had criticized Roth's bill for failing to address the
issue. The amendment would exempt the first $1,000 of capital gains
income from taxation starting in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's bill reduces the top tax rate individuals pay on
capital gains from 20 percent to 15 percent. His bill also would
lower the rate corporations pay on capital gains from the 35
percent now, to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate tax bill also would eliminate the alternative minimum
tax _ the tax put into the code to ensure upper-income families
with numerous deductions pay at least some revenue to Uncle Sam _
for middle income families.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill contains numerous other provisions, including
eliminating income limits on Individual Retirement Accounts,
allowing changes to 401(k) savings plans, enhancing the tax
benefits for middle-income families trying to pay for child care,
and granting a 20 percent tax credit for renovating homes in
certain historic districts.
</P>
<P>
   The House also agreed to tie the tax cuts to reductions in the
national debt. If the country's debt load does not decrease each
year, later reductions in the income tax brackets would be delayed.
The Senate bill has no such provision, and Lott said there would be
opposition to adding it during the conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., the ranking
Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, called the Republican tax
bill ``a magic show,'' a ``remarkable slight of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a member of the Senate Finance
Committee, argued that if the bill were signed into law Congress
would be forced to raise taxes on to pay for budget deficits.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted Friday to cut taxes by $792
billion over the next 10 years, moving the Republican-controlled
Congress toward a politically charged showdown with President
Clinton over how the nation can best use trillions of dollars in
projected federal budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 57 to 43. Four Democrats joined 53 Republicans in
support of the bill, while two Republicans and 41 Democrats voted
against it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would cut personal income taxes by reducing the lowest
tax rate starting in 2001. It would give a tax break to many
married couples, expand the Individual Retirement Account program,
create a deduction for some health insurance costs and reduce the
inheritance tax on large estates.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bill's provisions, which also include breaks for
business and special-interest groups, would be phased in gradually
as the expected surpluses grow, and some would not be fully
effective until 2009. Of the total of $792 billion in tax
reductions over 10 years, only $4.1 billion would take effect next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William V. Roth, R-Del., who was the main author of the
measure, said the Senate had taken ``a giant step forward to give
the American people a tax break.''
</P>
<P>
   The House passed a tax cut last week that is the same size as
the Senate's but has different provisions. Leaders of the
Republican majority from both houses met Friday even before the
Senate bill had been passed to begin reconciling the two versions.
They hope to complete their work next week before Congress leaves
for its summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the momentum
within the party was toward adopting the centerpiece of the House
bill, a 10 percent reduction in all income tax rates. Such a move
would further harden objections to the tax bill among Democrats,
who say the House approach favors the wealthy even more
disproportionately than the Senate version.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has promised to veto the Republican tax bill in whatever
form it emerges from Congress. Along with most Democrats in
Congress and Vice President Al Gore, who laid out his own tax
proposal Friday, Clinton is pushing for a tax cut of no more than
$300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Republican approach would risk a return of big
budget deficits, forgo an opportunity for further reductions in the
national debt and leave too little of the anticipated surplus to
deal with Medicare, education, health care, the military and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``By pushing through a tax plan that is too big and too bloated,
the majority party has pushed aside our vital national
priorities,'' Clinton said in a statement released by the White
House as he returned to Washington from Bosnia. ``I will not sign a
tax plan that shortchanges our seniors and our young people. I will
not sign a plan that signs away our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the House and Senate bills amount to the opening
gambit by Republicans in what is likely to be a high-stakes
negotiation between the White House and the congressional
leadership this fall over taxes, spending, Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   To a considerable degree, any negotiations will be driven by
complex calculations within both parties about how a deal would
affect elections next year. With both the presidency and control of
the House up for grabs, some members of both parties would prefer
drawing lines in the sand and fighting out their differences on the
campaign trail. Others see a compromise as the best way of showing
that their party can be trusted to govern.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight will also reflect fundamentally different
ideological approaches to government and taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a large tax cut, Republicans said, there is enough
money to deal with pressing problems like Medicare. And they said
returning as much of the government's excess revenues to the
taxpayers is the best way of insuring the economy's long-term
health, and the best defense against further growth in the size and
influence of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put a surplus on the table in this town, it gets
spent,'' Speaker Dennis Hastert said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said it is imprudent to lock in a big tax cut now when
there is no assurance that the anticipated surpluses will
materialize. They said the last big tax cut, in 1981, had sent the
nation into a spiral of rising deficits and debt from which it had
only just emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another riverboat gamble with the American economy,''
said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   If the surpluses do materialize, Democrats said, they should be
divided among a variety of needs, including modest tax cuts for
low- and middle-income families, additional spending on vital
programs, reducing the national debt and shoring up the Medicare
system of health insurance for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   There is one point on which the two parties generally agree:
that the portion of the projected surplus generated by Social
Security payroll taxes _ about $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years
out of a total surplus of $2.9 trillion _ should go only to shoring
up Social Security's financial condition or revamping the
retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they are fighting only over the remaining $1
trillion or so. After taking into account technical calculations
about the tax cut's effect on interest payments on the national
debt, the $792 billion Republican plan would use up nearly all of
the surplus.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the final hours of debate Friday, the Senate rejected or did
not take up scores of amendments intended to score political points
or secure a change that would benefit an interest group. But it
adopted a number of amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was an expansion of the provisions intended to
eliminate the so-called marriage penalty, which leaves many
two-income couples paying more in taxes than they would if single.
The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas,
would add to the tax package an increase in the standard deduction
for couples filing jointly.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also accepted an amendment offered by Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., and Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., to reduce
capital gains taxes. The measure would allow taxpayers to exempt
their first $1,000 in capital gains each year from capital gains
taxes, starting in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and his
counterpart in the House, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee, are scheduled to meet Sunday to begin
negotiating in earnest over how to mesh their bills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reconciling different approaches to income taxes,
the marriage penalty, reductions in the inheritance tax and other
components of their packages, they will have to pick and choose
among a variety of much smaller provisions that are important to
politically influential constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   They will also have to steer their way around a number of
political dilemmas. Moderate Republicans in the House have
threatened to block the tax package if the final version does not
include a provision making the tax cuts dependent on keeping
interest payments on the national debt under control, a contingency
not included in the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   They could also be under pressure to delay those tax cuts that
take effect next year. Faced with an intense squeeze on spending
bills, the House is moving toward dipping into next year's budget
surplus to pay for government operations, meaning that money would
not be available for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats who voted for the Senate tax cut were Torricelli;
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, and John Breaux and Mary Landrieu, both of
Louisiana. The Republicans who voted against it were Arlen Specter
of Pennsylvania and George Voinovich of Ohio.

FOES OF ARMY TRAINING SCHOOL SUCCEED IN CUTTING FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of frustration, foes of the Army's
``School of the Americas'' won a key House vote Friday to cut
funding for the controversial facility, which they blame for
training Latin American military officers who trample human rights
at home.
</P>
<P>
   The 230-197 vote was the first congressional move against the
School of the Americas to win the support of the House, and marks a
significant victory for opponents who have tried to close the
school for more than a decade. Graduates of the school were linked
to the 1989 murder of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador, and to the
region's notorious death squads.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would eliminate only about 10 percent of the $20
million in federal funds earmarked for the school, but the
relatively wide margin of victory signals trouble for the facility
_ which had survived four similar House votes since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say the United States stands for human rights when we
are training terrorists right in our own country,'' said US Rep. J.
Jospeh Moakley, a South Boston Democrat who led the investigation
into the 1989 murders and sponsored Friday's amendment. ``This vote
sends a loud and clear message that we want this school closed.''
</P>
<P>
   The school, located at Fort Benning near Columbus, Ga., is a
military training ground for soldiers from Latin American
countries. Soldiers there learn tactics to combat communist
guerrillas and drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   For years, opponents have argued for its closing because the
school has produced some of the worst violators of human rights in
Latin American history, including Panama dictator Manuel Noriega,
who is now imprisoned in Miami for drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which came as an amendment to the $12.7 billion
foreign aid bill, would withhold funds for recruiting and
transporting officers to the school, cutting the number of students
the school can admit per year. It passed the House after midnight
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This essentially means the school will gradually lose its
power,'' Moakley said. ``It will be forced to shut down if they
don't have any students.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Representative Joseph Kennedy, Moakley and other House
members have been mounting an aggressive campaign to shut down this
school since 1989, after 19 of the 26 people involved in the priest
murders were found to be graduates of the school.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of the school argued that the investigations led
by Congress and the Pentagon over the past 10 years have failed to
prove allegations that the school teaches torture tactics to its
students.
</P>
<P>
   The school's supporters also argued that a majority of the
60,000 graduates have not been involved in human rights abuses. In
fact, many of its graduates promote human rights and support
democracy, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who persist in accusing the school of criminal and evil
conduct are turning their backs on the facts,'' Representative
Sanford Bishop, a Georgia Democrat, told the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Sonny Callahan, an Alabama Republican and
chairman of the foreign operations appropriations committee, said
he has sent investigators from his panel to Fort Benning to ensure
that it is not teaching terrorism tactics to its students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school has cleaned up its act,'' Callahan said. ``The only
thing we hear year after year are the atrocities committed by
graduated of the school decades ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill argued human rights abuses by graduates of
the school are continuing even today, and that with the Cold War
over, the school is no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This school not only trains effective soldiers, but effective
killers,'' said Representative James McGovern, a Massachusetts
Democrat, who as an aide to Moakley helped investigate the murder
of the Jesuit priests. ``Proponents will say that only a few bad
apples are causing trouble, but from where we stand, this school
graduates more than just a few bad apples.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside groups, particularly religious activists, have fought
against the school for years. Some opponents have launched hunger
fasts and have been jailed for their protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic first step towards shutting down the
school,'' said Carol Richardson, co-director of SOA Watch, a
watchdog group that has strongly opposed the school for the past
decade. ``This vote brings a message of hope to those who have
suffered at the hand of people who have attended this school.''

TAYLOR DEAL FAR FROM MADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the eve of what was expected to be the NBA's
relocation/reenlistment derby and there's big news from Los Angeles
Clipper Maurice Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were trying too hard to shock everybody,'' said
the third-year power forward, who was not referring to team owner
Donald T. Sterling's anticipated reluctance to offer Taylor a
maximum contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who dumped agent Norm Nixon for go-to rep David Falk
earlier this month, is seeking a prolonged Clipper contract worth
$70 million over six years.
</P>
<P>
   Such moves can be made starting Sunday, but during a recent
workout at Veteran's Sports Complex in Carson, Mo had other things
on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much foul language,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Was a contract the `language' topic of Taylor's review? No, the
topic was a movie, ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.'' So
after spending some down time back home in Detroit, Taylor returned
to L.A. this week with a film critique and strong motivation to
resume voluntary, low-post oriented lessons from assistant coach
Jim Todd.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the contract extension is an issue, but Taylor won't have
much to say on the matter until Falk returns from his African
vacation in another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say I'm optimistic,'' Taylor said, ``because I know the
coaching staff and most of the organization wants me around for a
while. But until David gets back, we'll have to sit and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has one season remaining on his opening, three-year deal,
but if the Clippers (Sterling) wait too long before making him an
offer he can't refuse, they (Sterling) risk opening the free-agent
door for many willing bidders.
</P>
<P>
   His final word on the the ``South Park'' flick?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was as good as the TV show.''
</P>
<P>
   The Odom Watch: The updated ETA on Lamar Odom, the Clippers'
selection with the fourth pick in June's NBA Draft, is Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor network had the ex-Rhode Island star scheduled to play
in Magic Johnson' charity game Sunday at the Forum, but according
to the Clippers Odom never committed to participate. He had
intended to return to L.A. this month, but his grandmother recently
suffered a stroke, and Odom has remained in New York to be with
her.
</P>
<P>
   Travel plans: Sunday is a potential get-away day for several
Clipper free agents, but the intended escapees have a big problem.
</P>
<P>
   The league is virtually capped out.
</P>
<P>
   Forward/center Lorenzen Wright, whose agent has billed him as
one of the most-coveted free agents of the summer, has drawn
interest from the Indiana Pacers. But to bring in Wright for
anywhere near what his agent is asking, the Pacers would be
required to clear cap room by trading equivalent salaries back to
the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   One offer included point guard Travis Best and forward Austin
Croshere, but the Clips aren't wild about Best's shoot-first
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible Wright destination is Atlanta. The Hawks
reportedly may ship Steve Smith to Portland for tag-team shooting
guards J.R. Rider and Jimmy Jackson, then deal either Rider or
Jackson to the Clippers, who would sign Wright for a comparable sum
and send him to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' free-agent list also includes small forward Lamond
Murray, who has drawn sign-and-trade interest from Miami (for
shooting guard Voshon Lenard) and Eric Piatkowski, a player the
Clips would like to bring back.
</P>
<P>
   Small forward Tyrone Nesby reportedly has piqued the interest of
several teams who realize the Clippers intend to match any offer
his agent can reel in. This also sabotages a sneaker contract from
a company that reportedly has offered Nesby a contract if he plays
for another team.

CHRISTIAN COALITION LEADER IN IOWA FIRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The national office of the Christian Coalition
Friday fired the organization's Iowa chairman, Bobbie Lee Gobel,
who alleged earlier this week that the Steve Forbes campaign was
trying to buy votes for an upcoming presidential straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Gobel had alleged that a Forbes aide sought to hire 500 people
from her Metro Temp company in Des Moines so they would vote for
him in an Aug. 14 straw poll of Republican presidential candidates.
The poll is expected to draw more than 10,000 people and the
outcome could make or break several campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign adamantly denied that it had tried to hire
the temporary workers, and claimed Gobel was fabricating the story.
Forbes aides noted that Gobel has been highly critical of Forbes
and has pointedly questioned the sincerity of his opposition to
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Coalition consultant Michael Russell, who spoke Friday
for the organization, said that Gobel was fired due to an
``unfortunate series of public statements'' by her. He declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Russell is a vice president of Virginia-based Creative Response
Concepts, whose clients include the Forbes campaign. Russell said
that his company's work with both Forbes and the Christian
Coalition had nothing to do with the firing.
</P>
<P>
   Gobel could not be reached for comment Friday, but a man who
identified himself as her husband said that he didn't think the
constitution of the Christian Coalition allowed it to fire his
wife. On Friday, Gobel said in an interview that she stood by her
charges that a Forbes aide sought to hire temporary workers to vote
for the millionaire publisher, saying, ``I haven't retracted
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition walks a fine line between politics and
religion. It distributes hundreds of thousands of ``voter guides''
at churches that highlight whether candidates agree with the
coalition's view on abortion and other issues. But the organization
said it doesn't endorse specific candidates, although it is widely
viewed as leaning toward Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Gobel had alleged that Jerry Keen, a former chairman of the
Georgia Christian Coalition who went to work for Forbes, called her
in February seeking to hire the 500 temporary workers to vote for
Forbes. But Keen said in a telephone interview that the charges was
``unequivocally'' false. Russell declined to say whether Gobel's
firing was related to her statements about Keen or her comments
about Forbes and other presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Friday about Gobel's firing, the Christian
Coalition said it ``sincerely regrets any inappropriate an
inaccurate public statements that have recently been made regarding
presidential campaigns or candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Friday whether the firing of Gobel meant that the
Christian Coalition believes that its leaders should not be
critical of presidential candidates. The organization's founder and
president, the Reverend Pat Robertson, is himself a former
Republican presidential candidate.

REP. FRANK STABLE AFTER BYPASS OPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US Representative Barney Frank was said to be in
stable condition and resting comfortably Friday after doctors
performed coronary bypass surgery to clear five clogged blood
vessels in his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Ferguson, the cardiologist who supervised the
operating team at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda,
Md., announced that Frank, 59, ``did very well during the
five-vessel bypass surgery, and is now stable and resting.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, in which blood vessels from Frank's legs were
transplanted to his heart, allows blood to bypass his clogged
coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The Newton Democrat had a mild heart attack in 1990, and
suffered chest pains after exercise on several recent occasions. He
was given a stress test last week, and a heart catheterization
procedure on Wednesday, and was scheduled for surgery Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went fine, as expected, and no problems are
forseen,'' said Peter Kovar, Frank's chief of staff. ``At this
point we are just focusing on getting him back on his feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank is expected to be discharged from the hospital next week,
and to make a full recovery, said Kovar.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman said before the operation that he hoped to
return to the House floor for votes next week, and to meet his
office appointments in Massachusetts during the August recess,
which begins on Aug. 7.

   What Happens if Harriet Makes More Than Ozzie? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American men, for the most part, no longer care if their wives
earn more than they do. But it seems their wives do care.
</P>
<P>
   While the caretaking housewife of 1950s television is no longer
the norm, a survey by Prudential Securities in New York found that
women are wary about stepping too far into the breadwinner role.
</P>
<P>
   In telephone calls to 851 randomly selected households, most men
said they were perfectly happy to have a high-earner wife: only 34
percent said they would find it a problem if their wives made more
on the job than they did. Yet 53 percent of women said they thought
there would be a problem in a marriage if the wife earned more than
the husband.
</P>
<P>
   So are men generally more liberated from traditional stereotypes
about financial roles? Perhaps. Asked whether a woman who earned
more than her husband should pay alimony after a divorce, 58
percent of men said yes, compared with only 48 percent of women. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Susan J. Wells &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fit for a New Start &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As more businesses find clients over the Internet, and as
customers increasingly take to the Web to compare prices and
offerings, traditional face-to-face sales representatives are
finding their jobs endangered. Two sales-intensive businesses where
the future may be dim are insurance and investments.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 months, nearly 13,000 job cuts have been
announced in these two sectors alone, according to Challenger Gray
&AMP; Christmas, an outplacement company based in Northbrook, Ill. But
John A. Challenger, chief executive of the company, says many of
the professionals set adrift in those cuts also have unusually
promising potential to find new success by starting their own
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Successful agents in insurance and investing are able to
develop a bond with their clients in order to learn what their
needs and goals are and then formulate a package of products and
services to meet them,'' Challenger said.
</P>
<P>
   That skill would be helpful in many kinds of businesses. But it
would be logical, Challenger said, for many of the displaced
workers in insurance and securities to become consultants in
financial planning _ a field that is likely to grow as more and
more people try to manage their investments, with the help of the
Internet, from their own homes.

LEADERS ENGAGE IN BACK-SLAPPING OVER BOSNIA SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO _ It may have been a courageous statement of faith, or
just an accidental irony: Bosnia, the nation hosting Friday's
high-level pow-wow on peace and stability in the Balkans, is so
dangerous that the State Department warns Americans against going
there.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop President Clinton and his fellow world leaders
from congratulating themselves on the end of the bloody wars in
Bosnia and Kosovo and touting the economic and political future of
one of the world's most troubled regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across most of central and southeastern Europe, the progress
of open societies and open markets has exceeded our most optimistic
hopes,'' Clinton told fellow heads-of-state in the recently rebuilt
_ and hastily gussied-up _ Zetra sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, they've done a remarkable, astonishing job of
rebuilding Sarajevo,'' Clinton added about the Sarajevans, who
endured a siege lasting more than three years. ``It doesn't even
look like the same place I visited two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The scars of the 1992-95 war are still highly visible, though
some were bandaged-over for the meeting of scores of leaders of
nations and international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the heavily-guarded arena is perhaps the most disturbing
example: What once had been a soccer field was turned into a
graveyard for the victims of the Bosnian war, a conflict that
killed 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most buildings are pock-marked from relentless shelling, and
others are in ruins. Land mines and booby-traps make many building
uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   The country itself is partitioned, and Bosnia-watchers believe
that the Serb-dominated Republika Srpska and the Bosnian Federation
_ home to mainly Muslims and Croats _ would ignite in war again if
international peace-keepers left.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders assembled Friday to come up with ideas to help keep
the fragile peace in Kosovo and Bosnia, and to make the rest of the
volatile region more stable _ a difficult task in an area that is
suffering from a series of wars, communist-era neglect, and added
economic fallout from the fiscal crisis in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Friday presented a US plan to bring more foreign
investment to the region through a combined $350 million in
investment and loan money. The cash, operated by the US Overseas
Private Investment Corporation, would help businesses finance
investment in risky southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But financial analysts are skeptical of the idea, saying that
the region is too political unstable and even dangerous for Western
companies to take a chance on them. The Clinton plan, they say, is
simply a bone to throw at US companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very difficult time seeing anyone, other than the US
taxpayer, putting serious money into'' the region, said Spencer
Jakab, an emerging markets expert at Credit Suisse First Boston in
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for any amount of money would I go anywhere where people
are walking around with AK-47s,'' Jakab said. ``You're not going to
see General Motors setting up an assembly plant in Pristina,'' the
provincial capital of Kosovo, Jakab said.
</P>
<P>
   The region still has serious, entrenched problems that make
things tough for investors, including communist-era legal systems,
cumbersome regulations, and corruption, said James Lyon, an analyst
with the Sarajevo-based International Crisis Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what I'm seeing'' in the summit proposals ``is just a
whole lot of hand-holding,'' Lyon said.
</P>
<P>
   The region has some long-term possibilities; both Albania and
Kosovo have mineral reserves, and several Balkan nations have good
agricultural potential. But internal strike makes the countries
unpredictable. Albania has a serious criminal gang problem, for
example, and Montenegro threatens to explode in a civil war against
its fellow Yugoslav republic, Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's needed is a rule of law,'' said Kenneth Lefkowitz, an
investment analyst in Sofia, Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria _ at the brink of both civil war and complete economic
collapse in 1997 _ has improved markedly since then. But it is only
because the International Monetary Fund forced a currency control
board and other strict financial rules on the still-emerging,
former Soviet satellite in exchange for the International Monetary
Fund's help, Lefkowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Clinton plan forced the Balkan nations to make real,
fundamental reforms in their economic and legal systems, ``you're
just delaying the day of recovery,'' Lefkowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential economic adviser Gene Sperling said there was an
``inherent'' condition on the money, since would-be investors _
even with the nudging and financial help of the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation _ would not sink money into countries unless
those nations made reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Dangling the investment fund in front of southeastern Europe
will create an incentive for those nations to change, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cash is the dominant weapon in the Clinton administration
approach to making southeast Europe more democratic and safer.
Serbia, for example, is being ceremoniously cut out of any plans to
reconstruct in the Balkans _ an idea backed by the scores of world
political and financial leaders at the Stability Pact Summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace requires economic progress. Conversely, economic
progress requires peace,'' said Bodo Hombach, the summit's special
coordinator. ``The very second'' Yugoslavs dump their president,
indicted war criminal Slobodan Milosevic, and embrace democracy,
``the stability pact will start up as a partner for its
reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from punishing Serbia, the Clinton administration wants to
help its opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, whose government opposes Milosevic, will be eligible
for help, said Clinton National Security Advisor Samuel Berger. But
Berger could not explain how money could be funneled to Montenegro
without having it go through the federal government in Belgrade,
which might well siphon off some of the cash for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also proposed spending $10 million to ``promote
democracy in Serbia,'' helping the feeble Serbian opposition to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large majority of the people in Serbia would like to see new
leadership,'' Berger said.

TAX CUT OK'D IN SENATE; SHOWDOWN WITH CLINTON LOOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate approved the largest tax cut in history
Friday, a proposed $792 billion break that creates a titanic
bargaining chip for Republican congressional leaders as they enter
crucial negotiations with President Clinton over the nation's
budget priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's veto threat, the Senate passed the huge
package, 57-43, after four days of heated debate and political
posturing, with leaders of both sides casting an eye toward the
2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Each side immediately sought to depict the other as out of step
with the nation's interests. The measure is expected to reach the
White House in September, after House and Senate leaders reconcile
their competing versions of a proposed tax break over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to cut taxes and the president wants to spend it,''
said the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott. ``That's what the
fighting is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House and many Democrats warned that the proposed tax
breaks are based on fragile projections of a $3 trillion surplus
over 10 years and are so exorbitant that many domestic programs
might need to be scaled back to subsidize the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he would oppose any tax cuts greater than $300
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate made the wrong choice for America's future today,''
he said in a statement issued during his flight home from the
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. ``By pushing through a tax plan that
is too big and too bloated, the majority party has pushed aside our
vital national priorities. The Republican tax cut is so large it
would undo our fiscal discipline and imperil our prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate measure would reduce the 15 percent tax bracket to 14
percent, ease the so-called ``marriage penalty,'' reduce
inheritance taxes, increase contribution limits for retirement
programs, and expand credits for education, health care, and child
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps the family and it helps the country,'' said Senator
William V. Roth, a Delaware Republican who is chairman of the
Finance Committee and the measure's chief architect.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of the Senate's 55 Republicans voted for the $792
billion break, joined by the New Hampshire Independent, Bob Smith,
and four Democrats: Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, Bob Kerrey
of Nebraska, and John B. Breaux and Mary L. Landrieu, both of
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The two Republican defectors were Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania
and George V. Voinovich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans fended off a flurry of last-minute attempts to amend
the bill, including an effort by Senator John F. Kerry to set aside
$20 billion of the projected surplus to increase Medicare
reimbursements to teaching hospitals, home health care agencies and
other Medicare providers that have been hit hard by cutbacks in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate narrowly defeated Kerry's measure, 51-49, as six
Republicans sided with Kerry and two Democrats defected. The GOP
supporters included the Maine senators _ Olympia J. Snowe and Susan
M. Collins _ and John H. Chafee of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that on an issue that matters to so many in this
country, the Senate would side with a tax giveaway that benefits so
few,'' Kerry said after the vote. But Kerry expressed optimism
about securing the Medicare money before the budget showdown ends
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Before the wrangling begins, though, the Senate and House must
reconcile their competing plans. Under the House plan, whose
centerpiece is a 10-percent cut in tax rates across the board, the
wealthy would reap a much larger portion of the tax savings than
they would under the Senate proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Lott expressed support for the across-the-board cut, calling the
plan ``the fairest'' because it would return the most money to the
taxpayers who contibrute the most.
</P>
<P>
   After a strategy session with House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert,
Lott said the two leaders hope to resolve differences in their
plans by the end of next week. But Lott said he will not send the
final package to the White House until Congress returns from its
summer recess in September.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for that, Lott said, is to prevent Clinton from
throwing ``a veto party'' while Congress is out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Once Clinton has vetoed the plan, negotiations will begin over
how best to allocate the projected surplus. The talks are expected
to touch on nearly every aspect of budget policy, from narrowly
targeted tax incentives to the long-term stability of the Medicare
and Social Security programs.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the struggle, supporters of a bipartisan alternative plan
to continue their push for $500 billion in tax cuts, which would
effectively split the difference between Clinton's $300 billion
limit and the GOP's $792 billion proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's backers urged both sides to forgo a lengthy stalemate
that could end in a ``financial train wreck'' similar to the
goverment shutdown of 1995. ``All of this maneuvering could be
avoided by the acceptance now of this sensible, bipartisan
alternative,'' said Chafee, who is scheduled to appear on NBC's
``Meet the Press'' Sunday to rally support for the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the maneuvering, Democrats forced a number of
politically sensitive votes in the final hours of the tax-cut
debate, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy's push to raise the
minimum to $6.15 an hour by September 2000. The minimum wage is
currently $5.15.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amendment says that if you work 52 weeks a year, 40 hours
a week, you ought to be entitled not to live in poverty,'' Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate defeated the measure, 54-46, on a procedural vote,
with Specter the only member Republican to join the unified
Democratic minority in the losing effort.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few amendments adopted without opposition was a
provision by Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican, to
expand eligibility for the child-care tax credit to all families
with children under age 1. Under current law, the credit applies
only to families who place their children in day care.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said the change was aimed at ending discrimination against
parents who stay home to care for their children.

NUDGING OUT MIDDLEMEN WITH A CHIP  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's biggest securities exchanges are under attack for the
way they do business. The days of the buttonwood tree under which
the New York Stock Exchange was founded, in 1792, are long gone,
and the days of the specialist seem to be fading.
</P>
<P>
   The era of the button _ otherwise known as electronic
communications networks, or ECNs _ seems to be moving in fast.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ stock market, the big
boys on the block, are feeling the heat. Last week, NASDAQ's board
authorized stepped-up preparations for converting the exchange into
a publicly traded company. The Big Board is considering a similar
move.
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ's action came a day after Archipelago, an upstart ECN
that accounts for about 2 percent of NASDAQ's daily volume, said it
intends to become a stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Harold S. Bradley, a senior vice president at American Century
Investments, has had it with the status quo. He took some time last
week to speak his mind and to say why investors should care about
the exchanges' future. Here are excerpts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. This whole push for change at the stock exchanges seems to
have come suddenly. But you don't agree with that, do you? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, we started using Instinet, the first ECN, for our
customers in 1989. And in 1992, the Securities and Exchange
Commission put out its Market 2000 report, which contained a
section on changing technology and its impact on markets.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Congress was worried that ECNs like Instinet might
fragment, balkanize and segment the markets and asked for comment.
</P>
<P>
   We filed a 24- to 25-page response relating to our needs and
those of our investors. But we were one of only four investment
firms that responded to that report.
</P>
<P>
   So this has not happened overnight. The New York Stock Exchange
has been so immune to technology that people were saying they
didn't need to change. But the partners in Archipelago, and we are
one of them, are saying there is a need for new mechanisms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why should John Q. Investor give a hoot? Why change? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. John Q. Investor should care because if he wants to save and
get good returns on his investments, he wants to get maximum return
on his invested dollar and not pay anyone any more than he has to.
Currently, intermediaries take an awful lot of money away from
those maximum returns.
</P>
<P>
   If someone is adding value to generate returns, I am happy to
pay them for it. But let me pay 2 people instead of 10. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Could you amplify on that? What kind of manpower is involved
in a Big Board trade? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you want to buy a stock, you call a broker, and you do
that on your own or through a mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   My trading desk then calls a sales trader, who calls the
position trader who calls the floor broker, and then the floor
broker goes to the specialist.
</P>
<P>
   That is 6 people, which means 11 folks are involved once all is
said and done. I find that completely absurd in today's world, and
I have to pay each one of those people in that chain. A computer
chip can get me on the floor in a nanosecond.
</P>
<P>
   The New York exchange has spent a lot of money on technology,
and they can process trades extremely efficiently. But the way
stocks trade is still the same. They need to spend a lot on
point-of-sale technology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think the New York and NASDAQ markets would function
better as for-profit organizations? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think they would become more efficient if they went public.
The only way to be successful in a public company is to align the
interests of your customers with your business model. NASDAQ and
the New York have some of the smartest people in the business. As I
said before, these problems are not new and not unstudied.
</P>
<P>
   But the staff at both is completely bridled and throttled by
their own members, who hamstring any innovation that might impede
their own economic self-interest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some have raised concerns about conflicts of interest if the
exchanges were for-profit entities. Do you share those worries? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I see far fewer conflicts of interest in a for-profit
exchange than under the current system. You would have public
owners and accountability. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A month or so ago, Merrill Lynch upset its brokers when it
decided to offer its clients access to low-cost online trading.
Isn't this the other side of the same coin? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The Internet disintermediates. It takes out the middlemen who
are not creating value. Now, there is a lot of value added in the
process. But right now it is hard to figure out just what it costs
and where it resides.
</P>
<P>
   When you take intermediation out, it will wipe out those who are
adding marginal or no value. Archipelago is the functional
equivalent of Amazon.com for selling stocks. The New York Stock
Exchange has to figure out a way to be Barnes &AMP; Noble.

TRIPP INDICTED FOR RECORDING LEWINSKY CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Maryland grand jury indicted Linda Tripp Friday
for secretly tape recording her conversations with Monica Lewinsky,
a step which could once more put a public spotlight on President
Clinton's relationship with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland charges could be complicated by Tripp's immunity
deal with the federal office of independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
Tripp provided the tapes to Starr, who then investigated whether
Lewinsky had conspired with Clinton to cover-up their sexual
relationship. Tripp was given immunity by Starr in exchange for her
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   But Maryland prosecutors, after announcing the indictment of
Tripp, said that Tripp's immunity deal did not extend to a
violation of state law. It is illegal for a Maryland resident to
tape a telephone conversation without the consent of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always believed and still believe this is a
politically motivated prosecution,'' said Tripp's attorney, Joseph
Murtha.
</P>
<P>
   But Maryland prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli, a Democrat, denied
that there was any political motivation behind the case. ``I can't
help how it will be seen,'' he said. ``We've done our duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp could invoke a ``whistle-blower defense,'' referring to
laws that encourage federal employees to expose federal misconduct.
Without Tripp's tape and her cooperation, it is possible that the
president's affair with Lewinsky _ and the alleged cover-up attempt
_ would never have become public. Now, it is possible that she will
be the only person in the matter to face jail time.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment against Tripp alleges that she taped a
conversation with Lewinsky on Dec. 22, 1997, after being informed
by her lawyer that it was illegal. The indictment also accuses her
illegally disclosing the conversation to Newsweek magazine. Tripp
faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for each
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky was questioned during the investigation and could be
called to testify if the case goes to trial, but it is unclear
whether Clinton would be called as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph diGenova, a Republican and former federal prosecutor,
expressed outrage at Friday's indictment, calling it ``legally
invalid.'' DiGenova, a frequent critic of Clinton, said that Tripp
made the tape recordings to protect herself against being drawn
into a conspiracy to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp has said she made the recordings because she feared
Lewinsky and Clinton wanted her to lie about the president's
relationship with former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey.
Willey has alleged that Clinton made a sexual advance toward her at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outrageous abuse of prosecutorial discretion,''
diGenova said, predicting the case would be thrown out of court. He
said that even if it was illegal for Tripp to tape record the
conversations with Lewinsky, prosecutors often do not pursue
charges against an individual who has ``served a greater good. It
happens every day in prosecutors' offices. It is called
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   But another former federal prosecutor, Bruce Yannett, noted that
federal immunity does not affect state laws and he said that
``given the blatant nature of the taping, a prosecution would
appear reasonable under those circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gillers, professor of legal ethics at New York
University, said that while Tripp might have broken the law, it
doesn't make sense to try to send her to prison. ``She already is
in her own little prison,'' he said. ``She is the friend who
betrayed her younger friend, and that is how people will remember
her. If you add up the winners and losers, she comes out in the
bottom of the loser category.''
</P>
<P>
   The laws on tape-recording telephone conversations vary from
state to state. For example, if Tripp had made the recording in
Washington, D.C.,which requires only the consent of one party, it
would have been legal, diGenova said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment follows by one day a ruling by US District Judge
Susan Webber Wright that Clinton must pay a $90,686 penalty for
lying in a civil suit about his sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   That suit was brought was by Paula Corbin Jones, who alleged
that Clinton had sexually harassed her when he was governor of
Arkansas. Jones's lawyers, seeking to establish Clinton's pattern
of conduct, asked the president whether he had a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky. The president denied having sex with
Lewinsky and indicated that he barely knew her. Later, the
president aide's said that Clinton did not believe that oral sex
fit under the judge's definition of a sexual relationship.

PUBLIC BROADCASTING AGENCY ACTS TO LIMIT LIST SHARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   US public broadcasting officials moved Friday to end a national
controversy over stations sharing membership lists with political
fundraisers, announcing that stations must ban the practice if they
want to get any federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   The Corporation for Public Broadcasting's move came after weeks
of controversy about list sharing with both parties. It began with
disclosures in The Boston Globe earlier this month that a list of
some 200,000 members had been made available to Democratic National
Committee fundraisers in 1994 and 1996 by WGBH in Boston, despite a
station policy banning the practice.
</P>
<P>
   While some Capitol Hill Republicans seized on the first
disclosures as proof of a long-alleged left-wing tilt in public
broadcasting, it soon emerged that several public stations had
traded lists with both parties as well as Republican Bob Dole's
1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Corporation president Robert T. Coonrod said the group was
taking the ``unprecedented step'' of dictating policy to local
stations because ``our goal is to restore the public's trust in the
work public broadcasting does every day.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, the corporation plans to
distribute just under $200 million in grants from the federal
budget to the 1,000 US public radio and television stations,
including $150 million for television and $46.7 million for radio.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation acts as an umbrella group for local PBS
stations, coordinating federal grants to them.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH usually receives about $6 million in federal aid each year
through the corporation, including funds for its FM radio station,
Channel 2 and Channel 44, although the figure fluctuates.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for grants, under the policy announced Friday,
stations must guarantee they will not ``sell, rent, lease, loan,
trade, give, donate, transfer or exchange membership or donor names
to, with, or from any candidate for public office, committees or
organizations supporting a candidate, political parties, or
organizations that solicit funds for use in political campaigns for
any purpose whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy also requires that stations who do exchange or rent
lists to other non-profit groups ensure that members who do not
want their names shared have their wishes honored.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH's vice president for communications, Jeanne Hopkins, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome and endorse the CPB's policy and hope that it
offers reassurance for viewers and listeners that public
broadcasting really is committed to operating in a way that earns
their trust. We also hope it brings this issue to closure.''
</P>
<P>
   WGBH officials have blamed the 1994 and 1996 list swapping on
low-level development officials who, they said, did not know about
a station policy banning what list swaps with political parties.
The station also fired the outside list broker, whom it has refused
to identify, who assisted in making those names available to the
DNC.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said the corporation's announcement is ``consistent''
with steps WGBH has already taken or plans to take to ensure no
repeat of the Democratic list-swapping flap.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, in a letter to station managers made
available Friday, Coonrod said that ``all of public broadcasting is
bein discredited'' by revelations at least two dozen stations
traded names with political fundraisers.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a spokesman for Louisiana Republican Rep. Billy
Tauzin, chair of the House Commerce Subcommittee on
Telecommunications, said Tauzin welcomed public broadcasting's
steps but still favored a law expressly prohibiting list swaps,
either directly or through third-party broker businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step in the right direction toward ending a very
unseemly and self-destructive practice,'' said spokesman Ken
Johnson. He said the PBS stations had ``undermined the integrity of
public broadcasting and the integrity of the American political
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the GOP gained control of Congress in 1994, some have
pushed to slash funding for PBS or privatize it. PBS has largely
escaped the budget ax since then, but faces a need for millions of
additional dollars to roll out high-definition television in coming
years.

COMMENTARY: THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT FOR FUN AND PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ But enough about him. What about me?
</P>
<P>
   Now that the John F. Kennedy Jr. marathon is officially over,
just in time for the new American Tragedy at Buckhead, this much is
clear: After two weeks of wallowing in his life and death, we know
no more about him than we did at the start. Nice guy.
Unpretentious. Handsome. No genius, but smart enough. On the other
hand, we learned far too much about those who exploited the
accident that killed him, his wife and his sister-in-law as an
opportunity for self-promotion and profiteering. With days of TV
and pages of print to fill and no news to fill it with, they just
couldn't stop countering the vacuum by talking rapturously about
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At the high end, if we can call it that, were otherwise
intelligent media hands eager to let us know, often in the first
paragraph of their articles or TV visitations, that they were zero
degrees of separation from the lofty celebrity to whom they paid
ostentatiously lachrymose tribute. ``When he was thinking of
launching George, we had lunch at a tiny Thai restaurant,''
confided Walter Isaacson in one of the two Time installments,
accompanied by synergistic CNN cameo appearances invoking his
palship with Kennedy. ``When my wife and I first had dinner with
him some years ago, he talked to her about Egypt ...'' wrote Lance
Morrow, also in Time.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Brinkley, the historian whom Slate magazine's David
Plotz has now immortalized as ``the William Ginsburg of the Kennedy
death circus,'' told us in Newsweek of ``lunches at New York's
Century Club or EATS Cafe,'' while Jonathan Alter, two pages later,
broke into the first person in his second sentence solely to
advertise his intimacy with the Caroline Kennedy-Edwin Schlossberg
nuptials. Tom Brokaw opened his TV Guide reminiscence with: ``John
and I didn't hang out a lot, but we ate dinner from time to time.''
Christopher Hitchens' air-kiss in Salon began: ``At a cocktail
party in the George Hotel in Washington about a year ago, I was
talking to John Kennedy. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Were these lyrical evocations of the departed prince (or icon,
or whatever) an homage to ``Camelot'' or Zagat?
</P>
<P>
   Less palatable still were the out-and-out vultures, the
hypocrites and the cluelessly tasteless. Bob Morris, a writer who
was at Brown with Kennedy (but ``didn't know him personally''),
parlayed a single recent phone conversation with him into a CNN
appearance, which he then spun off into a confessional for The New
York Times about his guilt over it all. Mike Barnicle, the
disgraced former Boston Globe columnist on the prowl in Hyannis for
career rehabilitation, became Kennedy's most ardent and
God-invoking eulogist on MSNBC _ even though he had lambasted JFK
Jr. in print less than two years ago for having ``the body of Joe
Piscopo and the brain of Sonny Bono.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle's current newspaper boss, Mortimer Zuckerman of The New
York Daily News, bad-mouthed George's advertising prospects on
MSNBC while framed by a news bulletin announcing the discovery of
Kennedy's corpse. On Fox the Rev. Jerry Falwell declared, ``I'm
admittedly much like John Kennedy Jr. in that all my life ... I've
lived close to the edge.'' Also on Fox, the movie critic Michael
Medved, backed by a shot of St. Thomas More Church, offered the
esthetic insight that if Kennedy's cousin Patrick, a congressman,
had been killed he wouldn't have merited so much TV coverage
because he wasn't as good-looking.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of such spectacle, the media consciences Don Hewitt
(of ``60 Minutes'') and Steve Brill (of you-know-what) have both
called for the press to be more respectful of the privacy of
celebrities _ though not until after ``60 Minutes'' had done its
Kennedy show and Brill had shared content-free reflections on his
encounters with his famous fellow magazine publisher on ``Larry
King Live'' hours after the plane was reported missing. The
invasion of celebrities' privacy is the least of the problem,
anyway. What was most disturbing about the Kennedy miniseries was
the shameless, unapologetic manufacturing and fictionalizing of
news, and not just by the veteran fictionalizer Barnicle (whose
report of a grief-stricken midnight sail by Teddy Kennedy had to be
retracted by his network).
</P>
<P>
   For starters, almost all of those who passed themselves off as
Kennedy chums in print and on TV, often referring to him on a
first-name basis, were imposters or grandstanders. Kennedy's
friends, many of whom are not famous, say that of all the
self-identified Kennedy acquaintances gabbing about him, the only
ones actually in their circle were Christiane Amanpour and the
ubiquitous John Perry Barlow, late of the Grateful Dead. That
garrulous pair excepted, Kennedy's many real friends remained
silent because, as one typically puts it, ``We didn't violate his
privacy in life, so why would we do it in death? We'd only want to
speak up if his portrayal was inaccurate _ but it's all been so
glowing. Those who are now asking to be viewed for posterity as a
first friend are asserting themselves the way they couldn't when
John was alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only were there falsified characters in this drama but
invented plot lines _ from the phantom flight instructor on the
plane, to the fictive fairy-tale mansion the couple was allegedly
building in New Canaan, Conn., to the bogus rivalry between Kennedy
and Hillary Rodham Clinton over the New York senatorial nomination,
to the vilification of Lauren Bessette and her bosses at Morgan
Stanley as the cause of the plane's tardy Friday evening departure.
Such touches recalled the false leads of the All Monica orgy, as
did the elaborate coverage of an event we couldn't see: The
off-camera Manhattan memorial mass was presented as ``live''
breaking news in the same manner as the off-camera grand-jury
testimony of Bill Clinton, complete with static visuals and chatty
color commentary.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying premise driving the Kennedy coverage _ that
America was mourning at a degree to rival the aftermath of either
Kennedy assassination _ may also have been somewhat of a
contrivance. Yes, most people were sad about these unnecessary
deaths _ who wouldn't be? Yes, those citizens who sincerely revere
the Kennedy family were no doubt heartfelt in their public
expressions of sorrow about this latest loss. But was the country
grieving at a scale and intensity to suspend all other news for a
week? Unsurprisingly, the Gallup Poll already shows that Americans
over 60 were most affected, and that nearly 60 percent of the
country found the coverage excessive, no doubt because they sensed
they were being toyed with.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst `John Garfield is still dead' story I've
ever seen,'' says the screenwriter William Goldman, referring to
the joke headline a reporter supposedly suggested to his editor
back in 1952 when the tabloids were running out of angles to
sustain the days-long coverage of the actor's death in mid-coitus.
It's not likely to be the last, for marathon mourning is now a hit
show-biz formula for generating ratings and newsstand sales, with
conventions that have nothing to do with the Greek and
Shakespearean tragedies commentators constantly cite but that are
richly redolent of afternoon soaps: the treacly theme music, the
cheesy greeting-card-art graphics, the New Age vocabulary of
``closure,'' the ritualistically repeated slo-mo video clips (the
3-year-old John's salute, Princess Diana's departure from the
Ritz). Though some cynics wonder if there is any celebrity left,
short of an American president, whose missing plane could sustain
this treatment, let us not forget the milking of the non-celebrity
carnage of Columbine. ``I think I'm going to start a Mourning
Channel,'' says the mordant Hollywood satirist Larry Gelbart. ``All
death all the time.'' If so, he'll have competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Now that this latest binge is over, it's hard not to feel empty
and befogged. Marathon mourning does not mean that the dead will be
better remembered. In England, where what British journalists have
labeled ``Diana fatigue'' is setting in, tickets for the permanent
memorial at Althorp now go begging. The best that can be said of
our latest epic cortege, perhaps, is that against all odds John F.
Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette and Lauren Bessette did not lose
their dignity along with their lives. The same cannot be said of
the living who made a spectacle of their deaths and grabbed the
starring roles for themselves.

POWERHOUSES HOLD SOME NEW CARDS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By ERIC QUINONES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors in search of long-term growth in Internet companies
may want to heed this adage: Brands rule.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, that may seem a subversive notion these days.
After all, scores of freshly minted dot-com stocks have climbed to
dizzying valuations, and many Web-focused investors have bypassed
the old-line media companies that control brand-name magazines,
music, movies and other so-called content with Internet potential.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street is betting that the situation is about to
change, as traditional media companies accelerate their efforts to
gain online advertisers and audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Three companies leading the charge are Time Warner, Walt Disney
and CBS. ``We know the products that they offer, and we've come to
expect a certain level of quality from them versus some newbie who
comes out of nowhere and claims that on the Web they're the hottest
thing,'' said Mark Hardie, a senior analyst with Forrester Research
in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   And these companies can cross-promote their efforts, giving them
a leg up on independent content providers.
</P>
<P>
   All three companies have announced deals in recent weeks that
add to their Internet assets, but the moves have caused little stir
in their stock prices. ``I'd say that value is not being recognized
in the marketplace right now.'' said Tom Barrett, an analyst with
MFS Investment Management, a money manager in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   So investors who hope to gain from such stocks may have to think
long-term. Tom Wolzein, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in New
York, expects the percentage of cash flow that these companies
derive from the Web, an amount now negligible, to climb into the
double digits over the next four to five years as they expand their
online businesses. Cash flow is a good benchmark for media company
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   The online build-up is under way. Time Warner, for example, said
on July 13 that it would merge Columbia House, the record club it
owns with Sony, with the online music store CDnow. Time Warner will
own 37 percent of the new company, which by the end of the year
will offer music that can be downloaded directly from the Internet
_ the hot new market for music.
</P>
<P>
   After the CDnow deal was announced, Wolzein raised his 12-month
price target for Time Warner stock by 28 percent, to nearly $91 a
share, citing the company's overall Internet profit potential. The
shares closed Friday at $72.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the overall online advertising market continues to
flourish, Wolzien projected that in 2001, Time Warner would have
cash flow of $8.7 billion, of which 3 percent would be from
Internet businesses. By 2004, he said, cash flow would reach $12
billion, with the Internet portion climbing to 11 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner has also moved to correct one misstep. It is phasing
out its Pathfinder site _ a platform for magazines including Time
and Money. Users tended to skip its home page and go directly to
the magazine Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company will focus on hub sites for target
audiences, combining related magazines with links to the Web sites
of other Time Warner properties, including WarnerBros.com and
CNN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Internet business took a big leap last year, when the
company bought about 42 percent of Infoseek, an online search
service, and then created its own portal, the Go Network. Together,
the destinations are the fifth-most-popular Web property, according
to Media Metrix, an Internet research company in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On July 12, the company announced plans to buy the rest of
Infoseek and merge all of Disney's Internet holdings into a new
company that it will control, Go.com. Shares in the new company
will be offered publicly through a tracking stock _ meaning that
the assets continue to be owned by Disney but that the share price
effectively tracks the performance of those assets. Disney can use
the tracking stock for acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's stock has been struggling this year, in part because of
falling merchandise sales. But Jill S. Krutick, an analyst at
Salomon Smith Barney, expects the shares to rise from their current
$27.4375 to the mid-$30s in the next year, partly because of
Disney's Internet investments.
</P>
<P>
   Wolzien expects Disney's online business to account for 4
percent of $5.8 billion in cash flow in 2001, rising to 14 percent
of $8.6 billion in cash flow in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   At CBS, the strategy has been to tap into existing Web-based
businesses. The company bought positions in several specialized
Internet companies _ including Marketwatch.com, Sportsline USA,
Medscape and Rx.com _ in exchange for millions of dollars' worth of
promotion across its TV and radio properties. CBS is also
reportedly developing a portal similar to the Go Network.
</P>
<P>
   Wolzien projected that CBS would report cash flow of $2.5
billion in 2001, 5 percent of which would be from online holdings,
with cash flow rising to $4.1 billion in 2004, 10 percent of it
from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   James Marsh, an analyst at Prudential Securities, expects CBS
shares to hit $51 in 12 months, up from $43.9375 on Friday.

U.S. COMPANIES ARE WARY OF CONTRACTS IN THE BALKANS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (Eds: This is an added story)  
(af) 
 By VIVIENNE WALT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As government officials gathered in Washington and Brussels last
week to pledge billions of dollars in aid to reconstruct the
Balkans, American companies said the political deck appeared to be
stacked against their winning many lucrative rebuilding contracts,
and wondered whether some are even worth pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these projects are sinkholes,'' said Skip Richardson,
global vice president for acquisitions at Brown &AMP; Root Services, a
division of Halliburton. The company has a logistics contract with
the United States military in the Balkans worth $180 million a
year, but it has not decided whether to seek reconstruction
contracts in the war-torn region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to determine whether these projects are
meaningful business opportunities,'' he said. ``If the money isn't
spent properly, you'll be doing the same things over again a year
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of some 60 countries as well as regional
organizations and aid agencies met in Brussels Wednesday and
pledged more than $2 billion to Kosovo, where fighting and ethnic
cleansing destroyed many thousands of houses and disabled
electricity and water systems. The funds are to be used for
land-mine clearance, water purification, home repairs and food aid.
</P>
<P>
   After the conference, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
visited Kosovo to view the damage first hand; though the bulk of
the $2 billion will come from European nations, the United States
will contribute $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the longer-term cost of rebuilding the province's
infrastructure of highways, railways, power grids, communications
networks and water supplies is likely to be far higher than those
numbers. The rebuilding figure, to be assessed in October at
another meeting of donors in Brussels, will yield much bigger
contracts for construction and engineering companies.
</P>
<P>
   But based on their experiences with other large-scale rebuilding
efforts in recent years, including the aftermaths of civil war in
Bosnia and Hurricane Mitch in Central America, American executives
say they have learned some hard lessons about labyrinthine
bureaucracies and political favoritism. This time around, they say,
they know better than to count on much cheer from the flood of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Like other engineering firms, Brown &AMP; Root rushed into Central
America last fall as $9 billion in aid was pledged in the aftermath
of Hurricane Mitch. The company opened an office in Tegucigalpa,
Honduras, and won several reconstruction contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But local political infighting has stalled nearly all major
rebuilding work in the country, Richardson said. ``We sent waves
and waves of teams down there,'' he said. ``We've spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars, and we don't have one revenue dollar to show
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, another kind of political threat looms, making
American companies fear that they will be shut out of Europe's
biggest rebuilding effort since the Marshall Plan after World War
II. The problem is an international hot potato called ``tied aid''
_ the practice of pledging aid on the condition that contracts be
awarded to companies from the donor country _ which is common in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   With bidding on actual contracts still months away, American
officials have already begun to rail against the convention,
arguing that while Europe should shoulder the majority of the cost
of rebuilding the Balkans, Americans paid much of the cost of
fighting the war itself, so American businesses are entitled to an
equal opportunity to profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be pressing hard for untied aid,'' said David Aaron,
under secretary of Commerce for international trade. ``We want
three principles: transparency, freedom from corruption and open
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war in Bosnia, the World Bank raised more than $2
billion to rebuild the country, of which Washington has contributed
about $590 million. Yet American companies have won very little
work there, partly because neither American political officials nor
business executives arrived on the scene ``until it was too late,''
Aaron said. ``They lost out there.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Commerce Department plans to post an official in
Thessaloniki, Greece, in the fall to coordinate timely American
bids for Balkan contracts. ``I think it's important to learn from
mistakes,'' Aaron added.
</P>
<P>
   But that will not resolve all the political problems. Sanctions
against Yugoslavia block companies from the United States and other
countries from rebuilding in Serbia itself so long as Slobodan
Milosevic remains in power, cutting them off from some of the most
attractive potential contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Fluor Corp., the giant construction company, sees potentially
huge jobs in Serbia _ where NATO bombs shattered oil refineries,
power plants and chemical processing factories _ that would play to
the company's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the political questions will have to be worked through
before we would be interested in participating,'' said George
Palmer, Fluor's spokesman in Alisa Viejo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   If reconstruction proceeds while Milosevic _ and the sanctions _
remain in place, ``the bulk of it will go to European companies,''
said Wayne Weiss, senior vice president for governmental affairs
for Black &AMP; Veatch, an engineering firm that operates in 90
countries. But there may still be time for political changes in
Belgrade to open the Serbian playing field to Americans, he said,
adding, ``Right now, there's a lot more hype than effort.''

DOLLAR MAKES CANADA A LAND OF THE SPREE

<P>
   NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario _ Love brought them here, but the cheap
Canadian dollar kept them from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Carte and Annette Lovejoy drove for two days from their
home in Cottageville, W.Va., to Niagara Falls, N.Y., to get
married, but the prices they found on a brief tour on the Canadian
side of the Niagara River persuaded them to tie the knot here.
</P>
<P>
   The clincher was the exchange rate they received for their
American dollars at a local bank. ``We gave them $300,'' the new
bride exulted, ``and they gave us $432 back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian dollar, nicknamed the loonie (for the bird on the
back of the dollar coin), has been on a two-year descent that some
people say is a little bit crazy. Although it perked up a bit in
the first half of this year, gaining more than 3 American cents, to
68.9 cents on May 4, it has since turned down again, closing on
Friday at 66.4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The longer-term decline, which economists attribute to the
continuing fallout from the 1997 world financial crisis, has
prompted a bargain-hunting boom by Americans. They are saving money
by boarding flights to the Caribbean from Canada, placing mail
orders in Canada, buying vacation homes in Canada and even sending
their children to college in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless Americans, too, are discovering the Canadian advantage.
Sheridan Lee Taylor, 25, headed for Vancouver nine months ago from
Utah with $600 in his pocket and never looked back. ``It lasted me
quite some time,'' he said. ``Six hundred dollars American turned
into $1,000 here, easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all things Canadian are bargains. Certain
products _ notably gasoline and alcohol _ remain far cheaper in the
United States because of higher Canadian taxes. And other goods are
routinely priced to reflect currency values; a book, for example,
might be stamped ``US $27.50/$45.00 CAN.''
</P>
<P>
   But whenever a currency is strong, there are good prices to be
had in markets away from home, and the United States dollar is king
around the world these days. Despite a recent surge, the euro has
fallen 8.2 percent against the greenback in 7 months, and countries
from Columbia to Thailand have found their currencies losing value
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The hegemony is making it cheaper for Americans to honeymoon in
Paris or to vacation in Brazil. But Canada is closer to home, so it
gets more than its share of American visitors out to get the
biggest bang for their bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Americans made a record 43.9 million visits to Canada last year,
up 8.4 percent from the previous record of 40.5 million in 1997,
when the Canadian dollar began its dive, according to the Canadian
government.
</P>
<P>
   The American visitors threw their money around, too, spending a
record $8.6 billion in 1998, up 24 percent from $6.9 billion in
1997, in United States dollars. And travel industry executives say
the numbers have almost certainly risen this year.
</P>
<P>
   American companies are also getting in on the action, spending
$12.7 billion (United States) on acquisitions in Canada last year,
up 70 percent from $7.5 billion in 1997 and nearly three times the
$4.4 billion in 1994, according to KPMG Corporate Finance of
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, we're kind of another Mexico,'' said Ross H. Chafe,
the president of Flags Unlimited in Barrie, Ontario. Last year,
Aberdeen Fabrics of Aberdeen, N.C., bought a controlling stake in
the company, which makes a half-million Canadian flags a year. ``It
was relatively cheap for them to invest in Canada,'' Chafe said,
``and the dollar allows us to compete very well in the American
market.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is also a game for weekend warriors, not just big
players. Last year, about 20,000 Americans who live near the
Canadian border drove to Canadian airports to fly to places like
Jamaica, Cancun and Las Vegas on package tours sold by Signature
Vacations of Toronto, according to Chris C. Robinson, the company's
national marketing director. That's twice as many as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is a very significant increase over the last
two years,'' Robinson said. He has been advertising in Rochester
and Buffalo newspapers to draw attention to the bargains. ``We've
really stepped that up over the last couple of years to ride the
wave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans don't even have to leave home to take advantage of the
favorable exchange rate. Motorcycle riders, for example, can log
onto the Internet to order oil filters, luggage and other
accessories sent by mail from Wolf BMW in Alisa Craig, Ontario,
halfway between Detroit and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mail-order business is something we got going about a year
and a half ago in response to the Canadian dollar being so weak,''
said Christine C. McQueen, a co-owner of Wolf BMW. ``We sell quite
a bit of stuff across the border.''
</P>
<P>
   American students are flocking to college in Canada, also
because the price is right. There were 2,917 Americans studying in
Canada during the 1997-98 academic year, according to the latest
available figures from the Association of Universities and Colleges
of Canada. That is up from about 2,400 a year in the early to
mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Reed, 18, of New Haven, N.Y., plans to attend the
University of Toronto, a prestigious Canadian school where a
partial scholarship will winnow down the costs to $8,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd been to Toronto and seen the school, but it wasn't really
playing into his thoughts much _ or ours,'' said his father,
William J. Reed. ``But in looking at the money and how far our
dollars would go, it made tremendous sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans are also buying vacation retreats in Canada. Keith D.
Hodson of Stevensville, Mont., a manager for Para-Chem, an
adhesives maker, just bought a third home, a two-bedroom
condominium 16 floors above downtown Vancouver in a building called
the Venice. The price was 280,000 loonies _ only $188,000 in
American money. The exchange rate ``just makes it a much better
buy,'' Hodson said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Brubeck, 38, of Berkeley, Calif., said he and his wife
were also considering buying a place in Canada. A cellist in the
band of the rock singer Sheryl Crow, Brubeck recently visited
Vancouver on the Lilith Fair concert tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we came up to Vancouver and bought property, we could get
an apartment in the city and a ranch 30 miles outside of the
city,'' Brubeck said. ``The American dollar being so strong would
definitely affect a decision to buy property in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   As American tourists throw money around across the border, the
ever-polite Canadians are holding their noses as they pocket the
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Robin N. Rootes, 23, a waitress in Vancouver, says the big tips
she receives from American customers more than make up for their
sometimes arrogant attitudes. ``They come over and spend and say
they can spend as much as they want,'' Ms. Rootes said. ``Yes, they
are demanding, and yes, they are high-maintenance.'' But, compared
with the natives, they tend to leave more loonies and toonies (the
nickname for Canada's $2 coins) on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, we're going to make money off of them,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ben C. Giles, 18, a recent high school graduate, is making his
money by handing out coupons for Circus World, a shop on the
tourist drag here on the Canadian side of the falls, working from a
post between the roaring water and an oversized Frankenstein
holding a hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people are coming over, so a lot of the students get
jobs,'' said Giles, resplendent in white makeup, a clown suit and a
fuzzy wig with red, yellow, green, blue and purple stripes. Still,
he shakes his head in annoyance at the Americans who ask him what
time Niagara Falls is turned off.
</P>
<P>
   The weak dollar is good news for Canadian exporters, too,
because their goods cost less in American dollars. As a result,
Canada's trade surplus with the United States widened by 7.7
percent last year, to $16.65 billion. By the end of May this year _
the most recent figures available _ it had more than doubled, to
$11.2 billion from $5.3 billion in the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The losers, of course, are Canadian consumers, who have to pay
more for American imports and can only dream about the
bargain-hunting trips they once made south of the border. Maxinne
Cheng, who manages a store in Vancouver's tourist district, said
she missed her trips to Seattle, three hours away by car, where she
used to shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an exact switch,'' Ms. Cheng said. ``Five years
ago, we would go down to Seattle to get good deals. Now the
Americans come here for shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures from the Canadian government show that day
trips by Canadians to the United States dropped 11 percent last
year, to 31.9 million, the lowest level in more than a decade and
about half the 60 million in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   As the effects of the powerful American dollar reverberate
across Canada, Canadian nationalists are fuming about economic
imperialism. ``There has been a fire sale of Canadian assets and an
influx of foreign capital,'' said Peter S. Bleyer, executive
director of the Council of Canadians, a nonprofit advocacy group in
Ottawa. ``It is about taking existing economic assets out of the
hands of Canadians.''
</P>
<P>
   He fears that in times of trouble, American companies will let
their hearts overrule their wallets and close factories in Canada
before laying off employees at home.
</P>
<P>
   But these are good times for Americans, and for now, many of
them are gambling on the cheap Canadian dollar _ sometimes
literally, in the casinos in several high-traffic spots along the
border. Even those who win, though, may wonder if their returns are
all that great.
</P>
<P>
   Ike Baker, 56, recently made the one-hour drive from his home in
Depew, N.Y., to show Niagara Falls to visiting relatives, and he
tried his luck at craps at a casino here. ``I started with 40
Canadian dollars,'' Baker said. ``I won $150; I lost $50 back.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he cashed in his $100 winnings, received just $60 in
American currency, and asked himself this: ``Where's all the
money?''

STAGE SET FOR PARTISAN SHOWDOWN OVER BUDGET SURPLUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 1) 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with the golden opportunity of deciding what
to do with a projected $3 trillion budget surplus over the next 10
years, Congress and the White House are engaged in a classic
struggle over tax and spend policies that appears headed for
high-stakes negotiations this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, a final agreement on how to use the
estimated $1 trillion in non-Social Security surplus funds won't be
easy because of divisions among Republicans and Democrats over what
should be done with it.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures of the upcoming election year will also play a
role in the deal-making, as all the participants involved in the
talks try to reap the most political benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republicans are hoping their plan to return $792
billion to taxpayers will eventually gain support from the American
people, a majority of whom are saying in public opinion polls that
they would prefer the surplus be used for debt reduction and
preserving Social Security and Medicare rather than tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Democrats and the Clinton administration, meanwhile, are
hoping that public opinion stays right where it is as they push
their own more modest $300 billion tax cut proposal that would also
reserve nearly $600 billion to be used for debt reduction,
increased education spending and $50 billion in new Medicare
benefits, including a prescription drug program.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a third group, calling itself ``the centrist coalition,'' is
floating a moderate bipartisan plan offering $500 billion in tax
cuts as a compromise aimed at avoiding what chief sponsor Sen. John
Breaux, D-La., says will be a certain ``train wreck'' with the
White House this fall if Congress fails to produce ``a sensible''
bill the president can sign.
</P>
<P>
   And a fourth, smaller group, made up primarily of Democrats, is
siding with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in cautioning
against major tax cuts or spending programs so that surplus funds
can be used to pay down the nation's $5.5 trillion debt, an action
that Greenspan says will help more than anything else to keep the
economic boom going.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time (since World War II), it appears that the
federal budget may actually go into a surplus _ if we let it. ...
So I ask, why not stay the course?'' said Sen. Joe Lieberman,
D-Conn., a leading proponent of the view that the best policy is to
do nothing and simply allow the surplus to go toward reducing the
government debt.
</P>
<P>
   But doing nothing doesn't appear to be an option as the 2000
election year approaches and Republicans and Democrats try to turn
the surplus projections, no matter how uncertain they may be, to
their best political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate Republicans succeeded last week in passing
their own differing versions of tax relief, totaling $792 billion.
A final bill will be worked out in conference between the two
chambers in the coming weeks and sent on to President Clinton, who
has vowed to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   His certain veto means that Republicans and Democrats will spend
this fall fighting over tax and spend policy on the eve of an
election year, with each side hoping to win public support for
their positions.
</P>
<P>
   The political rhetoric and outright demagoguery is already
evident.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans charge that Clinton would simply spend the country
deeper into debt and plunder Social Security funds as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to cut taxes and the president wants to spend it.
That's what the fighting is all about,'' Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters after the Senate approved the
GOP bill Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, is denouncing the Republican tax cut plans
as folly, saying they would not only jeopardize needed Medicare
spending for prescription drugs but would also put an end to some
school reading programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton charge enraged Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who
called Clinton's comments a ``disgraceful'' display of ``shameless
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said the remarks proved that the Democrats are more
interested in having a political issue to use against Republicans
than supporting a significant tax cut for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who is hoping to capture his party's
presidential nomination, is also trashing the Republican bills in
an effort to win support for the administration plan that provides
$300 billion in tax relief, boosts Medicare spending and puts more
money into education and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is hoping to connect with aging baby boomers and the
elderly who were being told last fall that a reduction in Social
Security, Medicare and other benefits was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the budget windfall projections of $1.9 trillion from
Social Security taxes and nearly $1 trillion more in discretionary
funds, Gore and Clinton contend that spending on Medicare and some
other programs can actually be increased beyond what would normally
be required to keep up with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus projections are forcing Republicans to rethink their
own fiscal policy positions as well, beginning with the question of
just how big government should be. Like the Democrats, they're
looking for a way to use tax cuts and moderate spending proposals,
which would be paid for out of the estimated non-Social Security
surplus of $1 trillion, to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP mantra for years has been ``less government spending''
and more tax cuts. But in the interest of protecting their majority
hold on Congress, moderate Republicans are pushing new spending
proposals this year that could end up breaking the budget caps
agreed to by Congress and Clinton in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In order to please some elements of their constituency, GOP
lawmakers are using accounting gimmicks and emergency declarations
to raise spending on defense and other areas. Even Senate Budget
Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, acknowledged last week that
both the House and Senate budget proposals this year will surpass
the spending limit caps by about $21 billion to $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Republican tax cut plans assume that Congress will
live within the 1997 spending agreement, the question arises: Why
offer a tax cut at all if the future, despite projections, is so
uncertain?
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan made that point in testimony before Congress a few
days ago in which he cautioned against new tax cuts and spending
until economic projections for the next 10 years are a little more
stable.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans mostly ignored the federal reserve chairman's
advice, or sought to spin his comments about tax cuts being his
``second choice'' for what to do with the surplus as an endorsement
for a big tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans believe it's a matter of principle to return
excess tax money ... to families and workers who sent it here,''
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, said
in summing up the GOP's general position on how to handle the
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   But where Republicans see an overtaxed public that sometimes
grumbles about excessive government programs, many Democrats see a
public that seems satisfied for now with the nation's state of
affairs and favors using the surplus to increase spending on
education, defense and health care rather than tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand this bidding war on tax cuts,'' Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., said before the Senate passed by a narrow
margin its own $790 billion tax cut measure. ``I really think the
vast majority of the American people are saying ... this belongs
not to us but to our children and grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about investing for their children's future,'' he
said, ``not about getting back some small tax cut that's not going
to help them much while the economy is doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   With a showdown over what to do with the surplus all but
certain, a handful of Republicans and Democrats led by Breaux are
trying to convince their colleagues to compromise with the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for a reality check about where we are and what we
need to do,'' Breaux told the Senate last week during debate on the
GOP bill.
</P>
<P>
   Without a compromise tax cut package, he said, ``We will end up
with nothing more than a political argument that we'll use against
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the 2000 election to have that argument is just fine with
some Republicans. Gramm, for instance, said in a television
interview last week that he would prefer to gamble on Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the leading contender for the Republican
nomination, being elected president next year rather than negotiate
this fall with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would simply wait, have a presidential election and then
have a tax cut, if people voted for one,'' Gramm said.

BEFORE IT MATERIALIZES, CONGRESS ALREADY HAS PLANS TO SPEND THE
SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TAX-CONGRESS.) 
(th) 
 By TIM WEINER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is primed to break its own rules and spend
the $14 billion budget surplus promised for next year, according to
senior members of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to spend billions more on the military, dubious of
cutting domestic programs any deeper and driven to finance members'
favorite projects in all 50 states, Congress already has proved
itself unable to live within the strict budget limits it imposed in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Those spending caps helped balance the budget, but they are now
squeezing too tight, members say. Congress broke the caps in a
last-minute $21 billion spending spree last year, declaring the
money ``emergency'' spending.
</P>
<P>
   Congress seems so likely to exceed the caps again this year that
Republicans and Democrats are now saying that they must rewrite the
law and lift the caps in order pass the spending bills required to
run the government. If the bills do not pass by Sept. 30, a
government shutdown looms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to change the law'' that set the caps, said Rep. John
E. Porter, R-Ill., a senior member of the House Appropriations
Committee. Many Republicans and Democrats in both houses of
Congress agree.
</P>
<P>
   But if the caps are lifted, members are ready with more than $20
billion in new spending programs. That would create a budget
deficit next year _ and that, in turn, could call into question
Republican plans for a tax cut in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the caps still make sense, Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., the
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, took a long pause
and let out a deep sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good question,'' he said, and changed the subject.
</P>
<P>
   If the limits remain, Congress will have to cut billions of
dollars deeper into domestic programs next year and the year after
that. Under the caps, it slashed nondefense spending by 11 percent,
or about $26 billion, this year.
</P>
<P>
   The caps brought federal spending on government agencies down to
$538 billion for the coming fiscal year. Congress will give half to
the Pentagon and divide the rest among every other federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   The strict spending limits, the Republicans say, will put the
federal budget about $14.5 billion in the black next year, not
counting Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican tax cut plan would take $4.5 billion out of
next year's anticipated surplus. That would bring it down to about
$10 billion. And members are already poised to spend that money,
and more.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders are scouring the entire federal budget,
seeking unspent billions from mandatory programs like Medicaid,
welfare benefits and interstate highway funds to try to find more
money that could legally evade the limits on domestic spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``A million here, a million there, maybe it'll add up and nobody
will notice,'' said John Feehrey, spokesman for Speaker Dennis
Hastert, who along with the majority whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas,
is dictating many of the creative budgetary and spending strategies
being used this year.
</P>
<P>
   They are increasingly resorting to accounting tricks and fiscal
gimmicks to preserve the appearance that both the anticipated
surplus and the strict spending limits will remain intact. Rep.
David Obey of Wisconsin, the House Appropriations Committee's
ranking Democrat, calls that appearance ``a public lie''
promulgated by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are absolutely no rules that govern the budget
process,'' Obey said Friday at an appropriations subcommittee
meeting. ``The rules are whatever the majority leadership says they
are at any given nanosecond.''
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, House Republicans ruled, fought and won in two
procedural battles to declare the $4.5 billion cost of the year
2000 census an emergency, erasing it from the budget's bottom line.
The law says emergency spending must be for ``unforeseen,
unpredictable and unanticipated'' needs; the Constitution says the
census must be taken every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans are also considering delaying billions of
dollars of Medicaid payments to the states due in September 2000.
The fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, so if the payments are delayed,
the Republicans figure they can spend the money in the fiscal 2000
budget and make it up later, in fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really playing with fire,'' said Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo. ``They can't pass the appropriations bills without
going through a lot of gimmickry.''
</P>
<P>
   Those gimmicks, he said, ``will call into question in the
financial communities whether we can handle our financial affairs
here with any credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be attempts to cut domestic spending deeper. The
leader of the most fiscally conservative caucus in the Republican
Party, Rep. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, has already trimmed about $1.7
billion from seven spending bills on the floor, and he says he will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   But others want to put much more money back. The pressure to
break the caps is strong. Republicans, clinging to a tenuous
majority in the House, where all spending bills originate, are
painfully aware of polls suggesting that Americans want increased
social spending more than they want a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans still want a tax cut badly. But, like the Democrats,
they want to spend more, too.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, they added an extra $700 million for veterans, raising
the ante on Vice President Al Gore, who this week announced that
the Clinton administration would seek an extra $1 billion for
veterans' health _ money the House had quietly added days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, senators from farm states are going to seek $9
billion in emergency spending for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Porter said his subcommittee, which finances labor, education,
and health and human services programs, will not approve its
spending bill unless most or all of some $15 billion in cuts are
restored.
</P>
<P>
   And in September, in closed-door conferences where differences
between House and Senate spending bills are reconciled, anything is
possible. A billion here, a billion there, as the late Sen. Everett
Dirksen of Illinois used to say, and the anticipated surplus
disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats and some Republicans now question whether the
projected surplus was ever realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Though its appearance was proudly proclaimed by the nation's
leading politicians, it was always an illusion, the Congressional
Budget Office said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The White House budget office projected that spending will be
$14 billion less than expenditures next year, above and beyond
surpluses in the Social Security account.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans looked at the congressional estimate of
revenues, compared it with the president's estimate of spending,
and called the difference a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're keeping two sets of books,'' Obey fumed.
</P>
<P>
   And he pointed to a page in the newly drafted $70 billion
spending bill for veterans, housing and other programs as a sign of
what the spending process has become. Under the heading ``Fiscal
Year 2000 Rationale,'' it reads: ``Copy to come.'' The rest is
blank.

BRITISH OFFICIAL IS FRONT-RUNNER FOR TOP NATO JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Britain's defense secretary, George Robertson, a
Scottish labor union veteran whose vigorous denunciations of
Yugoslav military actions in Kosovo were almost as intense as
NATO's bombing campaign this spring, became his country's candidate
Friday for NATO secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, 53, immediately became the front-runner to succeed
Javier Solana, who is soon to leave the NATO job in Brussels,
Belgium, to become the European Union's coordinator for foreign and
defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair announced Robertson's nomination in
Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, at a summit meeting on the Balkans.
``He would do an excellent job, and we will be pressing his case
very hard,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said Blair
had received ``positive responses'' from President Clinton,
President Jacques Chirac of France, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
of Italy and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain, the British
Press Association news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   NATO diplomats said Blair had come under intense pressure from
Clinton and Secretary of Defense William Cohen to nominate
Robertson for the job after Germany's defense minister, Rudolf
Scharping, took himself out of the running earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robertson is very well regarded in Washington and is extremely
close to Cohen,'' a ranking alliance official said. ``The British
strategic defense review, which lays out a plan to make British
armed forces more maneuverable and easily deployable in rapid
response situations like Kosovo, is regarded as a model for other
countries like Germany to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of Robertson came just after the first
reshuffling of Blair's Cabinet this week.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential nominees had aroused little enthusiasm in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The British Liberal Democratic Party leader, Paddy Ashdown, a
former paratrooper and a strong supporter of the bombing of Kosovo,
had been suggested, but allied officials worried that he had never
held a high government post and would be at a disadvantage dealing
with alliance defense and foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark's defense minister, Hans Haekkerup, was well enough
thought of in Washington, but officials in Paris ruled him out
because Denmark is not a full member of the Western European Union,
a military organization that is to be absorbed into the European
Union and, under Solana's leadership, develop close operational
ties with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium had suggested former Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene,
who was defeated in elections in June after a major scandal over
foods tainted with cancer-causing dioxin. But with still-fresh
memories of the resignation four years ago of another Belgian
secretary-general, Willy Claes, in an arms corruption scandal, few
people at NATO thought Dehaene was a strong candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has never held the job because NATO's supreme
allied commander in Europe, now Gen. Wesley Clark, has always been
an American.
</P>
<P>
   Clark learned this week that he would be leaving next April,
three months early, to make room for Gen. Joseph Ralston, now vice
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Though some reports in Washington suggested that Cohen and
Pentagon military chiefs had had less than cordial relations with
Clark, Solana described him Thursday as ``a truly outstanding
supreme allied commander'' during ``the most difficult and testing
time for the alliance,'' and said he would continue to shape the
alliance for the 21st century until he left next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of Ralston, an Air Force officer, coming hard on
the heels of a NATO bombing campaign dominated by sophisticated
U.S. planes and weapons that succeeded without use of ground troops
in getting Yugoslav forces out of Kosovo, is widely regarded in
Europe as a sign of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, in this view, will be less and less likely in
the future to become involved with ground troops in European
peacekeeping operations like the one now under way in Kosovo, and
more inclined to let the European allies sort things out on the
ground while Americans hover in the air.
</P>
<P>
   And with Britain and France now committed to taking the lead to
strengthen European defenses and hold up their side of the
trans-Atlantic defense bargain, Robertson seemed likely to have
French support for the NATO post.
</P>
<P>
   Solana's term ends formally at the end of the year, but he has
made clear that he would leave earlier once his successor was
agreed on. That could happen as early as August if allied
representatives in Brussels determine that there is consensus among
all 19 member countries on Robertson, an official said.

ATTEMPT TO FUND CHILDREN'S HEALTH COVERAGE LAGS

<P>
   Since the US government made $24 billion available two years ago
to help states provide health care coverage for at least five
million uninsured children by the year 2002, just a little more
than a million have been signed up, according to a national report
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had expected three million children
to be enrolled by now, but health officials said Friday that they
were nonetheless encouraged by the strides made so far toward
insuring the nation's children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very large and very significant increase in a very
short period of time,'' said Vernon K. Smith, author of the
national report, which was commissioned by the Kaiser Commission on
Medicaid and the Uninsured and presented Friday at a forum in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) was created in
1997 to provide $24 billion in federal matching funds to states
over five years, with the hopes of addressing one of the symptoms
of the nation's ailing health system _ children who go without
needed medical care because they have no insurance.
</P>
<P>
   It represents one of the most comprehensive attempts to change
the way the nation covers children since the Medicaid program began
three decades ago. States were given the flexibility to use the
CHIP money to expand their existing Medicaid programs, or to create
totally new programs for reaching uninsured youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the states were to make that goal of insuring five
million children by the year 2002, set by federal officials when
the program began, there could still be as many as six million
children without coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The latest analysis of Census figures indicates that 11 million,
or 15 percent of all children in the United States, are uninsured
at any one time.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where just over 46,800 are enrolled in
CHIP-funded programs as of the end of June, more than 100,000
children still remain without coverage, according to state figures.
</P>
<P>
   But Rich Copp, spokesman for the state Executive Office of
Health and Human Services, said that 46,800, along with another
approximately 41,200 children enrolled since 1997 in the state's
Medicaid program, represent a major achievement in a relatively
short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the numbers speak for themselves. We have 88,000 more
insured children than two years ago,'' Copp said. ``The outreach
that the administration has done has resulted in almost 90,000 new
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Copp also pointed to another 19,000 children enrolled in a
separate state program, called the Children's Medical Security
Plan, which provides outpatient benefits and no hospital coverage
to those who do not meet Medicaid or CHIP eligibility guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Children who are disabled or whose family incomes range as high
as 200 percent of the federal poverty level can either qualify for
Medicaid, now known as MassHealth, or the state's new CHIP-funded
program to help pay for private insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Copp said, these various expansions have helped shrink
the percentage of uninsured children in Massachusetts from about 11
percent in 1995 to about 6 percent in 1998, according to a recent
state survey.
</P>
<P>
   Health care advocate Allison Staton agreed that the state has
done a good job expanding health coverage to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing pretty well in Massachusetts. The CHIP expansion
is going really well. It's exciting,'' said Staton, deputy director
of policy for Health Care For All, a Boston-based advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   But she acknowledged that ``not every kid who is eligible is
enrolled'' in CHIP. ``Even if it's less than 5 percent, that's 5
percent too many.''

39 WORLD LEADERS MEET TO PLAN BALKANS RECONSTRUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Adjacent to a graveyard of
Bosnia's war dead, 39 world leaders, including President Clinton,
met here Friday to inaugurate an effort to rebuild southeastern
Europe and its economy from the ravages of a decade of war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the only leader to pledge specific aid Friday,
announced an economic package of about $700 million in aid, trade
initiatives and business incentives to generate investment in the
Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkan package is in addition to $500 million in relief
assistance earmarked specifically for Kosovo that the United States
pledged on Wednesday in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The aid flowing to the region is intended to address both long-
and short-term problems. In the short term, the $500 million
pledged by the United States, as well as larger sums by other
countries, will go to rebuild Kosovo and repair the damage caused
by the war, as well as to compensate neighboring countries who
housed refugees or suffered economic harm.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the leaders gathered here Friday are seeking to
avert future conflicts in the Balkans through longer-term economic
reconstruction. The eventual scope of the effort, which began with
the U.S. contribution of $700 million, is not yet clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not enough to end a war,'' Clinton told students at a
Sarajevo school during his trip here. ``We must build the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Having chosen this re-emerging but still shell-pocked city as a
hopeful symbol, the president and other leaders Friday agreed to
what they called a ``Stability Pact'' to rebuild and develop the
region at a one-day summit meeting of heads of state from the
Balkans and industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   The horrors visited upon this city and the region must be
``consigned to history,'' Martti Ahtisaari, the president of
Finland and of the European Union, said as he opened the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is high time for the region to make up for lost time,''
said Ahtisaari, who helped negotiate the peace in Kosovo. ``The
Stability Pact envisions a Europe at long last undivided,
prosperous and free. A Europe where war becomes unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   The main goal of the summit meeting was for the nations to
promote peace and economic assistance for the region. But they also
pointedly wanted to try to isolate Slobodan Milosevic, the
president of Yugoslavia, who was not invited. The leaders here said
that as long as Milosevic remained in power, they would not
contribute to the rebuilding of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton put it: ``I do not believe that we should
give reconstruction aid to Serbia as long as it rejects democracy
and as long as Mr. Milosevic is in power. We have had enough of
`ethnic cleansing.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Russian prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, repeated
objections he had raised earlier in the week over the decision by
Clinton and European leaders to deny aid to the Serbian people
because of Milosevic. Again, he reminded the conference that
failure to provide aid could lead to ``very complicated and
unpredictable'' consequences for Yugoslavia's 10 million people as
winter approaches. He predicted a human ``catastrophe'' if the
Serbs do not receive aid.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his criticisms, he signed the pact because he did not
want to ruin the summit, Russian officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have any serious apprehensions about this pact,''
Stepashin said here.
</P>
<P>
   The $500 million in immediate aid to Kosovo pledged by the
United States was in part offered to to head off such criticism.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to see the Serb people freeze or suffer during
the coming winter,'' Barry Toiv, a spokesman for President Clinton,
said after the summit. But he said that the United States and its
allies would ``work through'' the distinction between relief aid
and reconstruction assistance, saying it would provide the former
but not the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the United States pledged $10 million to ``promote
democracy'' in Serbia. The money will go to the democratic
opposition to Milosevic and to encircle Serbia with a ring of
transmitters for the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe to
counter Milosevic's state-run propaganda machine.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There was no price tag on the total amount that the 39 countries
plus several international institutions like the World Bank would
spend on the rebuilding of southeastern Europe. The United States
has estimated that its cost for the air war was anywhere from $3
billion to $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Costs to the countries surrounding Yugoslavia have been
considerable, since their trade was disrupted and since they
absorbed thousands of refugees. The International Monetary Fund had
estimated this summer that helping Montenegro and Kosovo, both of
which are part of Yugoslavia, and Albania, Macedonia, Romania and
Bulgaria could cost $1.25 billion to $2.25 billion a year for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, the European Commission
and the World Bank said pledges of up to $2 billion had been made
toward reconstruction in Kosovo, although commission members
questioned the figure, saying some of that money had already been
collected and disbursed. Estimates of the cost of rebuilding Kosovo
have varied widely, but have been somewhat reduced by the lessening
of assessments of damage to the province.
</P>
<P>
   Among the aid itemized in Brussels was $200 million for
immediate needs identified by the United Nations, $45 million to
cover Kosovo's budget deficit, and $318 million for reconstruction
in the province based on initial estimates by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Among Clinton's pledges announced Friday are business and trade
initiatives including a plan to have the Overseas Private
Investment Corp., a U.S. agency, establish a $150 million
investment fund for the Balkans and provide an additional $200
million in credit for U.S. companies seeking to set up operations
in the region. To promote trade, Clinton also announced an
initiative that would grant duty-free status to some exports to the
United States. The United States also plans to contribute up to $50
million to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to
encourage business ventures, provided the bank targets an
additional $80 million for the region.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would ask Congress to reduce the tariffs for
exports, such as shoes, from the Balkans to U.S. markets. The cost
of the lower revenue over five years is estimated at between $50
million and $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has already approved the $500 million in relief aid to
Kosovo, and its approval is needed only for the duty-free imports
portion of the package.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, told
reporters that America had a direct interest in the reconstruction.
``Helping the region is strongly in our national interest by
reducing the risk that our troops will have to fight another, far
costlier European conflict down the road and helping to make the
whole of Europe a stronger partner for advancing our security, our
prosperity and our values.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and other leaders like Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany did not address
the main summit meeting, leaving the limelight to the nations of
the region to underscore the idea that the reconstruction is
something the leaders of the region are seeking, not something
imposed by richer countries.
</P>
<P>
   But in remarks afterward, Clinton acknowledged problems with the
reconstruction efforts in Sarajevo after its own civil war earlier
this decade. ``The Dayton agreement in 1995 did not rid Bosnia of
all anger and fear or frustrating problems like high unemployment,
corruption and crime,'' Clinton said. ``But Dayton did offer all
the people of Bosnia peaceful means to resolve their differences
and move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said, Sarajevo can boast of ``fair elections, a free
press, reformed courts, a new single currency, the beginning of
economic growth, better ties with your neighbors, war criminals out
of power.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that refugees were still returning, and he found at
Friday's meeting that the three leaders of Bosnia were speaking
``with one single united voice.''

U.S. MOVES TO REGULATE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ON THE INTERNET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Food and Drug Administration Friday announced
steps to curb the illegitimate sale of prescription drugs over the
Internet, while officials at another agency, the Federal Trade
Commission, asked Congress to force electronic pharmacies to post
detailed online information about their licenses and the doctors
who write the prescriptions they fill.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials' pronouncements, which came during a
Congressional hearing to examine the burgeoning electronic drug
trade, revealed as much about what the government cannot do as what
it can do. While authorities say they may be able to rein in
domestic companies marketing pills on line, they acknowledge that
the bulk of the business is conducted overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, it was hard for you to buy a foreign drug; you
had to go to a foreign country,'' William K. Hubbard, associate
commissioner for policy at the FDA, said in an interview. ``Now the
Internet makes it simple, and you can't do anything about these
foreign sites because you don't have the reach to foreign
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth of prescription drug sales in cyberspace has been
troubling state and federal officials for the last year, but no one
agency has the authority to regulate it. Typically, medicine is
prescribed by doctors, who are licensed by state medical boards,
and is dispensed by pharmacies, also licensed by the states. But
the explosion in electronic commerce, coupled with demand for the
impotence pill Viagra and other new ``life-style drugs,'' has
turned the old system on its head.
</P>
<P>
   Now doctors are prescribing pills on line to patients they have
never met, in states where they are not authorized to work.
Pharmacies are shipping pills across state lines without the
requisite licenses. Regulatory authorities have disciplined some
doctors and pharmacies, but the work is slow and difficult because
the ownership of Web sites is so hard to track.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, no one knows how many electronic pharmacies
exist. Rep. Ron Klink, the Pennsylvania Democrat who pressed for
Friday's hearing before the Oversight and Investigations
Subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee, said his staff had
identified more than 200, but there may be twice that many.
Hubbard, of the FDA, said his agency will begin trying to identify
each site and learn where it is registered, so the authorities in
those states can be alerted.
</P>
<P>
   Klink, meanwhile, said he intended to introduce legislation next
week along the lines of the trade commission's proposal, which
would require that any Web site selling medication state its name,
address and telephone number, as well as the states in which the
pharmacy and its cooperating doctors are licensed. The online
pharmacy industry is already objecting to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we are saying is that if you are selling a pharmaceutical
product, just like your neighborhood pharmacy has to display their
license, you have to display yours on your Web page,'' Klink said
in an interview. ``We are asking nothing more from the electronic
commerce people than we are asking from anyone else who is in
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Razzouk, chief executive of PlanetRx.com, an online
drugstore licensed to ship medicine to all 50 states, said he
prefers a voluntary system set up by the National Boards of
Pharmacy, a coalition of state licensing authorities. The coalition
has begun registering online pharmacies, and accrediting them with
its seal of approval.

REGULATORS TAKING A LONG LOOK AT DAY TRADING INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas) (With GA-SHOOT-RDP) 
(rk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Compared with the nation's largest and most
well-known brokerage firms like Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, day trading companies like those in Atlanta
where a gunman killed nine people on Thursday have operated in near
obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, securities regulators say, hordes of investors
have taken up day trading in recent years, hoping to profit from
the minute-by-minute fluctuations in stock prices. Many of these
people are investing novices, armed with little more than hope,
some cash and access to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   But officials who have examined the books and records of several
day trading firms say that more than 90 percent of the people who
engage in day trading lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the killings in Atlanta, state securities regulators
were growing increasingly concerned about the burgeoning numbers of
day traders in the United States and the companies that cater to
them. In late November, the North American Securities
Administrators Association, which consists of all state and
provincial regulators in the United States, Canada and Mexico,
warned investors against day trading, calling it a form of
gambling, not investing. The organization also announced that it
was forming a task force to investigate the day trading phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike full-service brokerage companies that sell stocks and
bonds and other securities to investors, day trading companies are
essentially selling access to the market and training people how to
trade. But this does not make them any less accountable to
investors, regulators say, and their operations must adhere to
securities laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, what these officials say they have found at many
day trading firms is a scary combination of unsophisticated
investors lured into the practice of day trading by talk of hefty
gains and minimal risks. They also say that many day trading firms
skirt securities laws and regulations designed to protect
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Voigt Crawford, Texas Securities Commissioner, has
brought three actions against day trading firms in her state. She
said that more enforcement actions are coming. ``Every single day
trading firm that we have examined in the state of Texas has
problems,'' Ms. Crawford said. ``And most are serious problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Atlanta shootings, day trading firms argued that the
increased regulatory scrutiny coming to bear on them was unfair and
an outgrowth of increased competition for business the day trading
firms are bringing to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 1 article published on the Web site of the Electronic
Traders Association, a day trading lobbying group, Saul S. Cohen, a
partner at the law firm of Proskauer Rose LLP in New York, wrote
that the once unchallenged empires of stock markets, traditional
brokers, institutional firms and regulators feel menaced by day
trading. ``Being threatened, these parties are waging a war against
day traders both through public relations and regulatory
intimidation,'' Cohen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unclear exactly how many people are active day
traders, Harvey Houtkin, chief executive of All-Tech Investment
Group, said in a television interview Thursday that as many as 10
million people could be considered day traders. That number is
almost certainly too high. But there are an estimated 100 firms
devoted to day trading; as of November, All-Tech alone had more
than 1,500 customers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Electronic Traders Association, a day traders'
lobbying group, these traders average 35 trades per day and account
for about 15 percent of trading volume in Nasdaq stocks. Few day
traders buy and sell New York Stock Exchange-listed shares.
</P>
<P>
   Securities regulators say that while most of those who become
day traders are men, participants come from a broad spectrum of
economic and professional backgrounds. Many are young, with little
in the way of job experience but older, more established doctors,
lawyers and former salespeople are also among those trading. More
women are joining the ranks of day traders too. Day traders
typically must put down $50,000 to begin trading.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems with some day trading firms, state
investigators say, is that their managements downplay the risk
associated with the practice. Although customers are asked to sign
documents that outline the risks, at the same time they are often
told that if they follow the trading practices recommended by the
firm in its training programs, their risks are vastly reduced.
Professional traders say this is not so.
</P>
<P>
   Certain day trading houses also skirt rules on how much money
they can lend to their customers to buy stocks. Traditional firms
offer to lend their clients 50 percent of a transaction's value,
known as margin lending. When stocks fall and the amount of cash
the customer invested initially drops below 35 percent of the
portfolio's value, certain day trading firms loan additional funds
to get the account above water.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks held in the portfolio continue to plunge, the
investor who has borrowed more than the 50 percent that is typical
could stand to lose more than double his or her initial investment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, regulators say they have seen former clients of day
trading firms leave owing as much as $100,000 to the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Some clients of day trading firms may open accounts there to
circumvent registering as an investment adviser with the Securities
and Exchange Commission or state officials, a law enforcement
source said. In these cases, day traders improperly pool customer
accounts and fail to disclose the risks inherent in their trading
practices.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the carnage in Atlanta, scrutiny on day
trading firms will almost certainly be stepped up. One securities
regulator who requested anonymity said that criminal proceedings
would be brought against a day trading firm in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Several brokerage houses sought Friday to distance themselves
from the day-trading phenomenon. Rebecca Metz, spokeswoman for
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., said the San Francisco company defines itself
as a ``buy and hold'' company. She said the cost of a trade on the
Schwab site, $29.95, ``isn't attractive to day traders,'' who can
pay $5 to $10 on other sites. Still, she said 2 to 3 percent of
Schwab's 6.2 million account holders are day traders, which would
put the number between 124,000 and 186,000 on Schwab alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem with day trading is that people are
exposed to something where they can lose an awful lot of money very
quickly but they don't understand it,'' said Maryland Securities
Commissioner Melanie Senter Lubin, . ``People don't understand that
stocks don't always go up. A lot of people do this because they
don't have a job. This is a very risky way to try to make money.''

   PITTSFIELD, Mass. _ Here in the sprawling Price Chopper
supermarket, between Aisle 6, devoted to detergents and dog food,
and Aisle 9, the home of peanut butter and jelly, Roger A. Enrico's
vision of the future is on display.
</P>
<P>
   Enrico is the chairman of Pepsico. In April, store workers and
Pepsi sales representatives tore apart Aisles 7 and 8, creating a
large space stocked with mostly Pepsi soft drinks and Frito-Lay
snack food. With an inflatable Star Wars pod racer dangling from
the ceiling, and large color photographs of adults and children
tucking into Pepsi products, the ``Power Aisle'' is hard to miss.
Pepsi hopes shoppers looking for a two-liter bottle of Mountain Dew
will grab a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos as well, or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of the company's marketing strategy known as the
Power of One, a New Age-sounding slogan for selling soda and snack
food together and maybe Pepsi's other core product _ fruit juice _
too.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, of course, is to pump up Pepsi's sales and profits by
taking advantage of some synergies unavailable to its rival, Coke,
and thereby boost its lagging share price.
</P>
<P>
   The Power of One doesn't just involve physically stacking
12-packs of Pepsi next to nacho cheese Wow Doritos (Enrico's
favorite) on one side and calcium-fortified Tropicana orange juice
on the other.
</P>
<P>
   It also means touting the combined profit potential of Pepsi's
array of products to supermarket managers in negotiations for
precious shelf space. And it means fortifying those deals with
Pepsi-paid promotions that will translate into tidy profits for the
stores.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has been kicking around Pepsico's divisions for years
now. In fact, displaying salty products next to thirst-quenchers is
so obvious that some regional managers have been pushing the
practice for a long time. But in the last few months, with the
appointment of a senior marketing executive to oversee it, the
concept has truly caught fire inside the company.
</P>
<P>
   One reason executives like it so much is that it plays to a
Pepsi strength _ product diversity _ that Coke, with its exclusive
focus on soft drinks, has no immediate hope of matching.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that the consolidation of the food industry in recent
years has reduced the number of big supermarket chains to half a
dozen from 20, meaning that selling just one major customer on the
Power of One could result in a huge boost to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today five customers will do 44 percent of our supermarket
business,'' said Al Carey, a senior vice president at Pepsico whom
Enrico named last year to oversee the strategy. ``What ends up
happening is that you have a more demanding customer, and a
customer who wants things they don't have, in terms of data mining,
category management, and telling them which promotions are
successful and which are not.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Pepsi hopes to become more or less married to
its major retail customers _ helping them sell Pepsi products,
using techniques that Pepsi will develop and pay for. Enrico even
dreams about stationing Pepsico employees full time in some big
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have a person from Pepsico who is there all day,'' he
said enthusiastically in an interview last month, looking tanned
and fit after a summer weekend in Montana. ``That person would
order the Frito-Lay products, as well as Pepsi and Tropicana
products, schedule the deliveries, do the merchandising and the
in-store category management.''
</P>
<P>
   And would store managers be happy about such outsiders coming in
and poking around their aisles? Of course they would, Enrico said.
``Anything we can do with these large and profitable categories for
retailers has tremendous leverage effect on a retailer's bottom
line,'' he said. Why, when he mentions putting a Pepsico employee
in a store full time to supermarket executives, he declared,
``their eyes light up _ they just love this.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some of them do. Others don't sound totally sold on the
idea. Even Price Chopper, which let Pepsi loose in its store here,
has some reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pepsi's sales grow at the expense of Coke's, then I've
gained nothing,'' said Jim Mizeur, a vice president at Price
Chopper's Schenectady, N.Y., headquarters. Besides, he added, ``If
Pepsi does it, do you do it with your Budweiser guy and your
Campbell's guy?''
</P>
<P>
   But if there is a tangible advantage for the store, then Mizeur
said he would not rule out such collaboration. ``The position we
take is if it grows the category, then we're in favor of it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a condition is music to Pepsi's ears. In stores where the
company has run trials, Enrico said, sales of Frito-Lay products
rose 21 percent, and sales of soft drinks _ all kinds, not just
Pepsi's _ increased, though not as much. People who have both salty
snacks and soft drinks in their homes, he noted, tend to consume
them together; the Power of One program is supposed to reinforce
what he already considers ``fundamental consumer behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have become believers as well. Bill Pecoriello,
who covers Pepsico and other beverage companies for Sanford C.
Bernstein, says the strategy should help Pepsi move more soft
drinks and snacks out the door. ``We're convinced that it's a good
idea,'' he said. ``The question is, why didn't they do this 30
years ago?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The strategy's current prominence goes back to Pepsico's
decision in 1996 to cast off its peripheral businesses and
concentrate on drinks and snacks. First, it spun off its restaurant
division. Then, Enrico pounced on Tropicana, paying $3.3 billion to
acquire it last summer from Seagram. Finally, Pepsi made its
bottling division into a separate, publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   Retail experts generally think the company is on the right
track. ``In this day of precious shelf space and the desire of all
retailers to cut product costs, I would think they would be
amenable to the idea at least, if it meant a savings to them and if
there were heavy promotional dollars behind it,'' said Paul
Bernish, a former supermarket executive who now runs a consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he added, ``There are a lot of suppliers who
are trying similar things.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics note that Pepsi can only fight for shelf space, not own
it. Even the Power Aisle here displays Rubbermaid plastic pitchers
and jugs of fruit-flavored wine in addition to Pepsi products. And
a big island of Coca-Cola 12-packs appeared recently, on sale for
$1.98. Considering the aisle is meant to display all kinds of soft
drinks, the Coke space is logical, but probably not what the Pepsi
designers had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   There may be more of that in store from Coke, which dwarfs Pepsi
in the $56 billion carbonated soft-drink business with 45 percent
of the market, vs. 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the largest account for Coke in this area,'' said the
store's grocery manager, Jim Collins, adding that when the Power
Aisle opened up, ``Coke wasn't happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke executives have been trooping in to see it, he added, and
he expects the company will come up with some competing version
before long.
</P>
<P>
   Coke has already begun to fire back with some in-store programs
of its own, said Polly Howes, a spokeswoman for the company. These
include a plan that offers shoppers Cokes as they walk into stores
(they have to pay for them on their way out, of course) and a red
``cart caddy'' that hooks onto shopping carts and includes a bottle
holder. Coke also has begun to promote its products with DiGiorno
pizza, Oreo cookies and other foods, all designed to increase sales
across the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the soft-drink category in and of itself is a
great profit generator for retailers,'' Ms. Howes said. ``And
consumers have been telling us for years that they link Coca-Cola
with all kinds of foods.'' In other words, not just potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the market seems to regard the Power of One as a
98-pound weakling when it comes to lifting Pepsi's share price.
With a price-earnings multiple of 30, compared with 47 for
Coca-Cola, Pepsi is hardly one of Wall Street's darlings, despite
its elaborate makeover.
</P>
<P>
   And investors bolted from Pepsico stock in late March after
Coke, not Pepsi, revealed that it was having a terrible quarter, a
fallout that Enrico finds puzzling since soft drinks account for
less than half of Pepsi's profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue with the share price is convincing investors
that they can deliver consistent 12 percent to 13 percent earnings
growth,'' said Pecoriello, the Wall Street analyst. ``Power of One
is one component of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Enrico has been basking in grocery-store scanner data
that show Pepsi growing faster than Coke (though at the same time
sales of the company's heavily promoted Wow chips are falling). And
he insists Pepsi stock will jump once the company shows growth
across several quarters. The company showed solid results in nearly
every operating group in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pepsico has moved from being a conglomerate to being an
operating company,'' Enrico said. ``We had a slightly decentralized
culture here, and that's one of the changes we've made. We don't
try to run the businesses from here, but we do try to work with
them to set the strategic agenda from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Enrico's biggest fear seems to be unrolling the program too
fast, forcing too much change on subordinates long accustomed to
working independently. What would be bad, he said, was if ``somehow
we pushed the pendulum too far on Power of One, and the divisions
don't drive their own agendas optimally, or if people lose their
sense of ownership over the end result.''
</P>
<P>
   The separate fiefdoms that made up Pepsico for years have not
exactly disappeared from the scene, and the risk remains that they
will resist pulling together toward the same objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same time, some inside Pepsico have complained that
the program isn't moving fast enough. ``I get criticized
internally, `Why aren't we moving on this?''' he said. ``My answer
is, this is of such strategic consequence, I don't want it to get
lost.''

AUTHORITIES SAY DEADLY AGGRESSION NOT LINKED TO GUN AVAILABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heavily armed and burning for revenge, a gunman spends days
readying himself for a personal war before returning to the scene
of his worst humiliations. He murders as many people as his bullets
can reach, then, with police closing in, kills himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three months, the roster of men for whom that
description applies has grown by tragic &UR;  &LR; proportions. In April in
Littleton, Colo., it was Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold at Columbine
High School. Then, earlier this month in Illinois and Indiana, it
was white supremacist Benjamin Nathaniel Smith.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in Atlanta, Mark O. Barton joined the twisted club
by carrying out a plan ``to kill as many of the people that
greedily sought my destruction,'' as he wrote in a note he left at
his home, near the bodies of his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on aggression, violence and culture say Barton's
vengeful assault reflected a pattern of particularly destructive _
and self-destructive _ responses to modern stresses, though several
cautioned against drawing sweeping conclusions about what such
attacks reveal about the United States at the end of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also differed markedly about how much emphasis
should be placed on the guns used by Barton and the other killers.
Some argued that the easy availability of handheld firearms
deserves a significant amount of blame, while others said Barton
and other killers might well have been stopped sooner if more
people were allowed to carry guns. Several of the gun control
skeptics noted that in the absence of guns, they might have chosen
other methods _ their cars or bombs _ to carry out their deadly
goals.
</P>
<P>
   There was widespread agreement, however, that the recent cluster
of multiple murders by suicidal men would likely be remembered not
as an aberration but as part of an ongoing, if sporadic, trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a real end in sight to this, and I don't know that
there is any intervention that we can think of that is going to
prevent this level of violence,'' said Dr. Terence Keane, director
of the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at the
Veterans Administration's Boston Health Care System.
</P>
<P>
   Keane said he views the Atlanta case and other similar shootings
as proof of Winston Churchill's comment that the veneer of
civilization is very thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have situations where people experience shame or
humiliation or loss and they can assign responsibility to others
for that, the boundaries of their aggression are limitless,'' he
said. What ultimately separates killers from the rest of society
are factors including the depth of shame, a lowered threshold for
acting out, substance abuse, and ``impulse disorders'' that
eliminate societal and personal fail-safe measures, Keane said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Goldstein, a psychologist at Syracuse University who runs
the Center for Research on Aggression, said Barton's case might be
different from the Columbine High School killings in that the
Atlanta killer's primary motive might have been ``mental
disturbance,'' as opposed to a variety of factors including media
influence and parental neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Mental disturbance and aggression do not necessarily go
together, Goldstein said. ``For the most part, people who are
disturbed, who have psychiatric disorders, are not more
aggressive,'' he said. ``But there might be more of an air of
irrationality to this case. He may have been thinking, `I'm going
down and I'm taking as many people as I can with me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein cautioned against seeing the recent spate of cases as
indicators of heightened societal aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, aggression is hard to explain and predict because,
first of all, it's a low-frequency event. The second part is that
far too often, in trying to predict and understand and control
aggression, you have a difficult time puzzling over what went on in
the person,'' Goldstein said. ``Every behavior, aggression or
whatever, is a function of things in the individual and things in
the environment. We might never know what it was in this
individual's history and environment that caused him to turn to
aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Eagly, a social psychologist who is a professor of
psychology at Northwestern University, said the cultural factors at
issue include ``glorification of violence in the mass media and
family structures that are less stable, so that people are less
linked-in effectively to families where a variety of positive
influences might occur.''
</P>
<P>
   She was among several authorities who noted that the sprees of
deadly violence are almost invariably the work of men. ``This sort
of behavior has been part of the male role as it has been construed
in US culture, from the frontier tradition on,'' Eagly said.
</P>
<P>
   In her view, the most effective immediate response would be
increased gun control. ``Not only would there be fewer guns, it
would be an expression of public sentiment that we want less
violence. That would change the cultural climate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That view was seconded by Kristen Rand, director of federal
policy at the Violence Policy Center, a gun-control advocacy
organization in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really believe this is going to be America's future unless
we decide to get serious about regulating guns, and from our
perspective that means a handgun ban,'' Rand said. In light of
congressional opposition to increased handgun controls, however,
Rand said she doubted any significant changes would result from the
horror at Barton's attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``This level of incident can go on forever and it won't get
through to people. I personally think it's going to take something
three times as horrific as Littleton, and I think we can count on
that happening,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Rifle Association, the Violence
Policy Center's most frequent nemesis on federal legislative
efforts, said the NRA would have no comment on the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still things we don't know about this tragedy, and
there will be a time and a place to debate public policy,'' said
NRA spokesman Jim Manown.
</P>
<P>
   Several academic authorities said it would be an error to
conclude that the Atlanta episode offers a clear argument for
greater gun control.
</P>
<P>
   John Lott, a professor at the University of Chicago School of
Law, said a better argument could be made for allowing more people
to carry concealed weapons. He said his research has found that
so-called right-to-carry laws have a demonstrable deterrent effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many attacks just don't take place, and to the extent they do
take place the amount of harm is mitigated by someone there with a
gun,'' said Lott, author of ``More Guns, Less Crime'' (University
of Chicago Press, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Roger Lane, a Haverford College historian and author of ``Murder
in America'' (Ohio State University Press, 1998), said the Atlanta,
Colorado, and Midwest cases reflect a particular kind of murderer
who is resigned to his own death.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kinds of people whose psychological profiles
more nearly resemble suicides than murderers,'' Lane said. ``What
mass murder does is both. It's suicidal, you never get away with
it, and you know that from the start. Either you're caught
instantly or killed instantly or you kill yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane was among the authorities who said a key change from the
past was the availability of guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mechanisms that trigger homicial aggression have always
been with us, and homicidal aggression has always been with us. But
now the weapons of mass murder are a lot more accessible.
Technology is responsible for these killings, and as a result we
are going to see more of them.''

GORE PROPOSES TAX BREAKS AIMED AT MIDDLE CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (See also TAX-CONGRESS) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ At odds with Republicans in Congress and with Bill
Bradley, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Vice
President Al Gore on Friday proposed a long list of tax breaks to
address specific social goals like making health care and education
more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better believe America's middle class deserves a tax
break,'' Gore said in what his staff billed as a major policy
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the Minnesota Community Technical College after a
fund-raising event here Thursday night, the vice president said
Republican tax plans like the one approved by the Senate on Friday
and the one passed by the House last week offered ``too much for
too few at the expense of too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's list _ ``carefully targeted,'' he said, ``to the
hard-working middle class'' _ would allow new tax deductions or
credits for education and retirement savings, medical expenses,
nursing-home costs, corporate research and development, child care,
low-income housing, energy conservation, school construction and
investments in poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey, did not respond to
the Gore speech. His staff said he was not running a campaign
geared to reacting to the vice president. And Bradley has not
himself delivered a campaign address detailing his tax policies.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's philosophy is well known. He was a central figure
in putting together the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the most
comprehensive tax law in the last half of the 20th century. He is
adamantly opposed to narrow tax breaks like those offered by Gore,
arguing instead that most, if not all, tax credits and deductions
should be abolished and that the money saved should be used to make
tax rates _ the percentage of income paid in taxes _ as low as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Bradley holds, if the government wants to promote a
particular social goal like education, it should spend the money
directly. Doing it through the tax code, he believes, is wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   Many tax breaks on Gore's list, like those for school
construction and child care, have been part of the Clinton
administration's budget and have generated little interest in the
Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore offered two new proposals Friday. One would be tax-free
savings accounts to allow workers to put aside money for education.
The other would be an increase in the standard deduction for
married couples who do not itemize deductions, so the couple's
deduction would be the same as if the two were single and filed
separate tax returns, eliminating the so-called marriage penalty in
the current law.
</P>
<P>
   Students, parents and grandparents could have up to $2,500
withheld from their pay and placed in the accounts. Employers would
be allowed to match the contribution. And taxpayers with incomes
below $40,000 would get an additional tax credit offsetting half
the money they placed in their accounts. The money could be
withdrawn tax-free to meet education expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's speech Friday was the latest of several in
which he has set forth detailed positions on issues, including
education, crime, cancer research and aid to religious institutions
to help combat social problems.
</P>
<P>
   On taxes, Gore has a fundamental philosophical difference with
Republicans that echoes through the running budget conflict between
the Clinton administration and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans want to keep taxes low with the explicit goal of
reducing the size of the government. The administration favors
using much of the budget surplus to maintain and even expand
government programs. Gore described the difference this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``Proponents of the Republican tax scheme will tell us: `It's
your money, and you should have it back.' It is our money. But it
is also our Social Security. It is our Medicare. It is our good
jobs and our stable economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's philosophical difference with Bradley is more
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, his staff says, believes that the government
will never provide the money directly to reach important social
policy goals and that the way to accomplish them is through
targeted tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley views that as an inefficient approach. People and
companies would adjust their finances to achieve tax savings, and
much of the cost to the government would go to taxpayers who are
not necessarily the ones the government is trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all politicians, whatever their party or ideology, agree
with the Gore approach, though they disagree over what the specific
tax breaks should be. Almost all academic experts on tax policy
agree with the Bradley approach of the fewest possible deductions
and exemptions and the lowest possible tax rates.

BRITISH NEWSPAPER GROUP WILL ACQUIRE A LONDON-BASED TABLOID FOR $2
BILLION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Trinity PLC, Britain's largest regional newspaper
company, announced Friday that it would acquire Mirror Group PLC,
owner of one of Britain's oldest tabloid newspapers, for 1.24
billion pounds, or about $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will create the largest newspaper publisher in the
country, combining local newspapers like The Liverpool Echo with
The Mirror, the third-largest selling newspaper in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   A takeover by Trinity illustrates how topsy-turvy the British
newspaper industry has become. Regional chains were once not as
profitable as the more glamorous, London-based national papers. But
regional newspapers have thrived in recent years while the big
national newspapers have suffered from stiff competition as they
try to increase sales by lowering prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a marriage of convenience,'' said James Holder, an
analyst with HSBC Securities. ``They were both the last bride and
groom outside the church and decided to just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time the two companies tried to get
together: Mirror Group left Trinity at the altar in March after it
rejected its bid of $1.53 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, to be called Trinity Mirror PLC, should be
able to lower its costs and increase its advertising sales as it
fends off competition from other newspapers and from the Internet,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get short-term cost savings and a critical mass,'' Holder
said. ``Their classified sales business is threatened by the
Internet, but this could help.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirror Group had been looking to from a partnership with another
paper. Several companies had been interested in buying Mirror
Group, including Regional Independent Media PLC, backed by Candover
Investments. A representative for Regional Independent Media said
the company was ``exploring all its options.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Trinity Friday closed down 14.5 pence, or 2.5 percent,
at 568.5 pence, or $3.53, while Mirror shares rose 5.5 pence, or 2
percent, to 260.5 pence, or about $1.62.
</P>
<P>
   Takeover activity in the newspaper industry in Britain has been
widespread. In May, Johnston Press PLC, the fifth largest local
newspaper publisher, agreed to buy the 83 percent of Portsmouth &AMP;
Sunderland Newspapers PLC that it did not already own for 220

   Trinity Mirror's roster of titles will include The Mirror, the
tabloid that was once Britain's most widely read newspaper, with a
circulation of five million in the early 1960s. Today, it sells 2.3
million copies and is third in circulation behind The Sun, owned by
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., and The Daily Mail, owned by Daily
Mail and General Trust PLC.

<P>
   To appease regulators, Trinity will be forced to sell its stable

that several suitors had expressed interest in the Northern Ireland
newspapers.

 (For release Sunday, Augst 01, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Bston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aug. 1 is the date traditionally reserved for writing about
summer reading, but I suggest that you pick up a thriller instead
of a business book. Myself, I am reading ``Charlotte Gray,'' by
Sebastian Faulks, a provocative novel of England and France during
World War II. ``A Dangerous Friend,'' about Vietnam, by Ward Just,
is next on my list.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though really good books about business and
economics are hard to find. Edward Chancellor's ``Devil Take The
Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation'' is elegant and
edifying. And Niall Ferguson's long but lively ``The House of
Rothschild: Money's Prophets 1798-1848'' rests heavy on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But I have something else in mind. ``The Frontiers of Research
in Economic Theory: The Nancy L. Schwartz Memorial Lectures,
1983-1997'' (Cambridge University Press, paperback) is not beach
reading, unless you are genuinely curious about where technical
economics is going.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are fortunate enough to belong to a reading group
whose purpose is to stiffen the resolve of members to undertake
somewhat harder tasks, then it is the best thing to come along in a
good many years. Indeed, if you abstain from heavy reading this
summer and invest an equivalent amount of time this fall, it will
stand you in good stead for many years into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Schwartz, fresh out of Oberlin College, spent the early
1960s doing a dissertation at Purdue University on the optimal
scheduling of tugboats and barges along a river with multiple
branches. That may sound kind of tame, until you reflect that such
planning techniques have great practical value in industry. It got
her hired to teach at Carnegie Mellon University in 1964 _ part of
an influx of economic talent that included Robert Lucas, Thomas
Sargent, Lester Lave, and Robert Kaplan, among many others.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the years in which knowledge of mathematical
programming was exploding among scientists and engineers. Amid
great excitement, the new techniques were being applied for the
first time to all kinds of economic problems involving sequential
choices _ even those involving expectations. The painfully shy
Schwartz formed a working partnership with the voluble Morton
Kamien, and together they applied the new mathematical tools to
problems of innovation and market structure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 the pair moved to Nortwestern, and a significant part of
the reason the Kellogg Graduate School of Management ascended to
the top ranks of business schools, a rival to Stanford and Harvard,
stemmed from Schwartz's stewardship of its PhD program. Top-flight
economists came and went, but mostly stayed. In 1981, Kamien and
Schwartz published ``Dynamic Optimization: Calculus of Variations
and Optimal Control in Economics and Management Science.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, without warning, and for no apparent reason, Schwartz took
her own life. She was 41. Her friends, led by Kamien, decided that
a distinguished lecture series would be the best memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The first lecturer in 1983 was Hugo Sonnenshein, Schwartz's
Purdue classmate. (Sonnenschein has let it be known that he will
step down as president of the University of Chicago next year.)
</P>
<P>
   In a 1983 talk called ``The Economics of Incentives,''
Sonnenschein surveyed a 50-year difference of opinion about the
provision of public goods. Paul Samuelson had been too pessimistic
about the ease with which sidewalks and streetlights would be
forthcoming, believing that government nearly always must be
involved; Ronald Coase had been too sanguine, arguing that citizens
would nearly always bargain out matters for themselves. Specialists
in the new field of mechanism design would have a field day in the
years ahead, Sonnenshein predicted _ and so they have.
</P>
<P>
   There have followed sixteen annual lectures by some of the
foremost names in scientific economics. Fourteen are collected in
this book. Andreu Mas-Colell on theory of perfect competition;
Menahem Yaari on the role of ``Dutch books'' in choice under risk;
Robert Aumann on the formal possibilities flowing out of the
psychological assumptions known as ``bounded rationality;'' Lucas
on the economics of new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are Truman Bewley on the differences between risk
and uncertainty; Reinhard Selten on evolution and learning; Vernon
Smith on experimental economics; Gary Becker on the significance of
habits, addictions, and traditions; Robert Wilson on negotiation in
litigation and strikes; Roy Radner on economic survival; Peter
Diamond on the nature of social insurance; Nancy Stokey on the
economics of social mobility; and David Kreps on learning to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   None of these essays is what you would call journalistic. Most
contain some mathematics and some contain a lot. Almost all,
however, are written in clear language that will be accessible to
anyone with a fond memory of college-level economics.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest is Yaari's talk about the significance of those
complicated heads-I-win-tails-you-lose contracts known to
speculators as ``Dutch books.'' The freshest is Wilson's essay on
pitfalls in the analysis of signaling. The most recent talks (not
included in the book) have been by Ariel Rubinstein on language as
a bargaining problem and Joseph Stiglitz on bankruptcy and
development.
</P>
<P>
   There is no synthesizing hand at work in this volume, though the
emphasis on the use of the most promising mathematical and game
theoretic tools narrows the focus a good bit.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation list also reflects a determination to showcase
important work somewhat more quickly than usually has been required
to become a Famous Economist _ witness the fact that only three of
the Schwartz lecturers have as yet been awakened by a call from
Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Northwestern is pleased. The community of
lecturers ``is like a family,'' says Kellogg school dean Donald
Jacobs who, with Kamien and Ehud Kalai, edited the volume.
</P>
<P>
   I'm satisfied too. But on my Michigan beach, I plan to
contemplate risk and uncertainty, addiction and tradition, in
strictly anecdotal form.

about House consideration of a foreign aid bill referred
incorrectly in some copies to the outcome of a vote on a bipartisan

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Tuesday, July 27,
about the Los Angeles Board of Education's debate over whether to
abandon a $200 million school project because of concerns about its
environmental safely misstated the views of an outside lawyer for
the school district. The lawyer, David Cartwright of the law firm
O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, assured the board that it was safe to build the
school on land adjoining a former oilfield only after a full
environmental review and an analysis of recommended safety measures
had been completed. He did not say the project would be safe
without such a study.
</P>
<P>
   The article also incompletely described the law firm's role in
representing the district and the project's developer, Kajima Urban
Development. The firm represented the developer on other matters,
not the school project. Both clients were aware of and agreed to
this arrangement and it was disclosed before negotiations on the

SCIENTISTS FEAR DEEP BUDGET CUTS WILL KEEP NASA EARTHBOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A surprise budget cut proposed for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration would devastate the agency's
science programs and possibly force the closings of two of its
major space centers, program administrators and scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   As members of Congress from both political parties who are
friendly to the space program maneuvered to temper a proposed deep
cut in the space agency's budget for the coming year, scientists
said they feared that any substantial reduction would
disproportionately affect critical science projects for years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee voted Friday to reduce NASA's
budget by about $1 billion, passing legislation that would finance
the agency at $12.6 billion, about an 8 percent reduction from this
year's spending levels. At the urging of members of Congress with
major NASA centers in their states, the panel restored almost $400
million that a subcommittee earlier recommended cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A $1 billion cut to NASA is still disastrous, both to managing
the current program and future exploration,'' said Dr. Louis
Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society, a national
space advocacy group, ``NASA's budget has been reduced every year
since 1992, and the agency has dealt with it. But this is too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees
money for veterans affairs, housing and independent agencies,
including NASA, recommended that NASA's financing for the 2000
fiscal year be $12.3 billion, about $1.3 billion, or 10 percent,
below the Clinton administration's request. This is also $1.4
billion below what the agency received this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the full committee passed by voice vote an amendment
to restore some money that was offered by the chairman of the
subcommittee that originally deleted the NASA money, Rep. James
Walsh, R-N.Y. Walsh's amendment restored $225 million for space
research and technology development, $100 million for the Space
Infrared Telescope Facility, the last of four major orbiting
observatories that the agency wants to orbit the Earth, and $75
million for future robotic missions to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure called for the additional money to come out of
the budget of the Americorp program, and the White House has said
that President Clinton will veto any bill that cut financing for
this program.
</P>
<P>
   The completed bill is to be voted upon by the full House next
week. Some NASA supporters say there may be more efforts then to
restore more money to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts for NASA and other agencies are the result of House
Republicans trying to find money to fund 13 spending bills required
to run the government that must be passed before the congressional
recess on Aug. 6. Even in a period of federal budget surpluses, the
lawmakers are trying to stay within spending caps imposed by a 1997
balanced budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel S. Goldin, the NASA administrator, lashed out at the
appropriations subcommittee cuts, saying such reductions would be
``devastating'' to an agency he said had been a model for cutting
costs and doing more with less. Reductions of this magnitude would
mean closing two or three space centers and personnel layoffs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who chairs the House Science
Committee, said he also was disappointed about NASA's funding, but
decried as ``scare tactics'' charges by Vice President Al Gore and
others that the latest reductions would result in closing centers
and layoffs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Police dubbed him the double-fisted shooter who
brandished a gun in each hand as he pumped 40 bullets into 22
people, killing nine.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he pulled out the same two weapons, pointed them to
either side of his head and fired once, killing himself instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Orrin Barton was well-armed Thursday afternoon as he fled
from the scene of one of Atlanta's grisliest killings in the heart
of the Piedmont Road business district.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Colt .45 caliber semiautomatic and Glock 9mm
semiautomatic pistols police say Barton used for the mass killings,
the shooter also had a Raven .26 caliber semiautomatic pistol and a
.22 caliber Harrington Richardson revolver buried deep inside a
duffel bag found in his Ford Aerostar van late Thursday afternoon,
police and Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At least 200 rounds of .45 caliber ammunition and two sets of
handcuffs, also were found in the bag, said Atlanta police
spokesman John Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Potter, an associate special agent in charge at the ATF's
Atlanta office, said Barton purchased the Glock in 1993 from the a
now-defunct gun shop in Warner Robbins. The 45-caliber handgun was
purchased in 1983 by a man in Richardson, Texas. Police believe
Barton may have obtained the gun through a private sale. The gun
has never been reported stolen. The Raven pistol was purchased in
1982 by another person, but ATF officials are not certain where the
gun, also not reported stolen, was purchased. The Harrington
Richardson revolver will be the most difficult to trace because it
was made 20 years ago, Potter said.
</P>
<P>
   The firearms, as far as ATF officials know, were obtained by
Barton legally and have not been used in any other crimes, Potter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no problems and no prohibitions placed on the
purchases of these guns,'' Potter said. ``In fact, because he had
no criminal record, Barton could have purchased guns the day he
killed all these people.''

PARENTS SHOULD GUIDE VIDEO GAME USE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the difference between a Furby, Pokemon, Game Boy and a
NEOGEO?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question posed, and answered, in the current issue
(July/August) of Children's Software Revue. It's part of the
issue's cover story: ``Friend or Foe? Every Parent's Videogame
Primer.''
</P>
<P>
   So you won't go away without the answers:
</P>
<P>
   Furby is an animatronic troll-like doll with large eyes. It uses
infrared signals to communicate. About $30.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon is short for ``pocket monster.'' It's based on a popular
television series, and the little monsters can be ``raised'' by the
child. Some models can fight against one another.
</P>
<P>
   Game Boy is a pocket-size, game-playing machine with a small
screen, available in both black and white and color models. There
are about 500 titles for the machine, although most are not in
color. The Game Boy Color was introduced in the fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   NEOGEO, from SNK Corp. of America, is designed to compete
against Nintendo's Game Boy. A color model will be available in
August. CSR said its child testers liked it better than the Game
Boy, although there are not as many cartridges available.
</P>
<P>
   The Revue's article on dealing with video games suggests seven
ways parents can make these games friends instead of foes:
</P>
<P>
   1. Put rules in place and abide by them. Be consistent with
time, and set examples.
</P>
<P>
   2. Know the issue and how to control it. ``A child gets into
trouble when video games become the substitute for sports, friends
and family,'' Arthur Pober, executive director of the Entertainment
Software Rating Board, told CSR.
</P>
<P>
   3. Video games can be noisy, but don't make the mistake of
relegating them to a remote corner of the house or letting the
child wear headphones. ``It is recommended that the games be kept
in an open, well-traveled part of the house, so the activity
becomes everyone's concern,'' the article recommends.
</P>
<P>
   4. Get involved. Join your children and understand what they're
playing and why.
</P>
<P>
   5. Provide a balanced media diet. Remember that only 7 percent
of the video games get an ``M'' rating reserved for the most
violent. There are hundreds of them that involve math, logic and
language.
</P>
<P>
   6. Increase alternatives. Supply and encourage creative
projects. Children have unlimited energy. Parents can channel it.
</P>
<P>
   7. Set firm limits. Play for an extra hour when nothing's been
done to merit it? What about a game title loaded with violence?
Think about those questions. Who provides the answer? You or the
child?

   MEXICO CITY _ One in every three Mexicans who cast ballots
earlier this month in a crucial election won by President Ernesto
Zedillo's governing party now say they received groceries,
scholarships, crop payments lottery tickets or other government
handouts before the vote, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of those who received the gifts voted for the
party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, the study
found.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, carried out in the state of Mexico, where the party
won the governor's race on July 4, is one of the first measurements
of the influence that government aid programs are having in
elections in a period when reforms have made outright ballot theft,
a common tactic in the past, almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders say the PRI has used government resources to
buy votes not only in the elections in the state of Mexico, but
also in elections in Guerrero, Tamaulipas and other states. The
votes are seen as dry runs for presidential balloting next year.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was carried out during the third week of July by Mori
International, a private, independent firm. The state of Mexico, a
sprawling region of industrial suburbs and hardscrabble farms
surrounding Mexico City, is the country's most populous, with 13
million residents, and like the federal presidency, its statehouse
has been controlled by PRI governors for 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Montiel, the PRI candidate, was elected governor with 41
percent of the vote. But the two losing candidates, from the
center-right National Action Party and the center-left Party of the
Democratic Revolution, insist that the PRI's overwhelming use of
government resources on behalf of its candidate made the election
unfair. They have joined forces to carry out continuing protests.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Lund, who directed the Mori survey, said he decided to
study the state of Mexico elections after noting before balloting
for governor last year in Guerrero that the government was
systematically using state-financed aid programs to persuade
farmers, students, housewives and other poor people to cast ballots
for the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we call pork in the United States,'' Lund said.
But the PRI's power to deliver government aid to constituents is
extensive because the party has held presidential power since the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``All over the world, there's an advantage to incumbency,'' Lund
said. ``But the powers of an incumbent are far greater for a party
that's been in power for seven decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Reta Martinez, a PRI spokesman, acknowledged that during
the state of Mexico elections there were numerous complaints about
local governments handing out food, building supplies and other
gifts to buy votes. But he said all three parties had engaged in
the same vote-buying practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the cleanest elections that we've had,'' Reta
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Duran, the National Action candidate, who finished
second, with 34 percent of the vote, denied that any cities
controlled by National Action had used municipal programs to buy
votes, although he conceded that the party had distributed baseball
hats and T-shirts bearing the party insignia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its not accidental that 80 percent of the people who said in
this poll that they received government aid said they voted for the
PRI,'' Duran said.
</P>
<P>
   People interviewed for the poll identified nearly a dozen
distinct forms of government aid that the pollsters concluded were
used to persuade voters to back the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Both in Guerrero and in the state of Mexico, Lund said,
scholarship payments were delayed for two months, with checks
finally delivered to parents of poor students just before the
balloting, often as PRI members made copies of parents' voting
credentials. The government also delayed delivery of farm payments
until just before the balloting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more effective in garnering votes was the delivery of
groceries to poor families, selected from detailed lists of
low-income households compiled by a government anti-poverty agency,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   This practice was widely documented by journalists. In the
working class Mexico City suburb of Ecatepec a week before the
elections, a neighbor working for the PRI knocked at the door of
Maria Garcia Romero, a young mother, inviting her to visit a nearby
home serving as the party's neighborhood headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving away groceries,'' the party worker told Mrs.
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Garcia waited in line behind other neighbors, PRI
workers gave her a bag containing sugar, oil, eggs and other
foodstuffs, wrote down her name and address from her voting
credentials and took her photo, Mrs. Garcia told a reporter.

<P>
   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. _ Linda Tripp, whose secretly recorded
conversations with an impressionable young friend exposed an affair
that led to President Clinton's impeachment, was indicted on two
criminal charges by a Maryland grand jury Friday for illegally
taping the telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The charges seemed to bring the Monica Lewinsky saga to an
improbable and dizzying full circle. Mrs. Tripp, who for many
became a reviled symbol of betrayal, found herself accused of a
crime 18 months after she entered the case as an accuser, bringing
to federal authorities the tape recordings that first alerted them
to Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp's tapes ignited the most serious Oval Office scandal
since Watergate and unleashed a criminal grand jury inquiry by
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, that culminated
in the president's impeachment by the House and his trial and
ultimate acquittal in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Mrs. Tripp faces a maximum penalty on each count
of five years years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's indictment charged that Mrs. Tripp violated Maryland
wiretap laws that make it illegal for one person to tape record a
conversation with another person without the other person's
consent, assuming that the one making the recording knows that the
state's statutes forbid it. Federal law and the laws of some other
states do not require such a notification.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said in the indictment that Mrs. Tripp, a civilian
Pentagon employee, illegally taped a telephone conversation with
Ms. Lewinsky on Dec. 22, 1997, without the permission of the former
White House intern after Mrs. Tripp had been told by her lawyer
that secret taping was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In the conversations that day, the two women discussed what they
should say about Ms. Lewinsky's sexual relationship with Clinton in
the testimony that each expected to give in a sexual harassment
suit against Clinton brought by Paula Jones, a former Arkansas
state employee.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also accused Mrs. Tripp of illegally disclosing
the contents of that conversation to Newsweek Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp was not present Friday at the Howard County
Courthouse, but her spokesman, Philip Coughter, told reporters that
Mrs. Tripp had become the victim of a ``shameful vendetta'' and
that the charges against her amounted to ``the most disgracefully
transparent campaign of politically motivated vengeance in recent
American history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it say,'' Coughter said, repeating his charge that
the inquiry had been sought by more than 40 Democratic state
lawmakers in Maryland, ``that the only person still facing legal
jeopardy is the only one telling the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   Only one other peripheral figure in the Lewinsky investigation,
Julie Hiatt Steele, has ever faced criminal charges. Ms. Steele was
tried for allegedly obstructing Starr's inquiry of Clinton. But the
jury deadlocked on the charges and Starr decided not to retry the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp's lawyer, Joseph Murtha, said that she would plead
not guilty at her arraignment, which has not yet been scheduled. He
said that Mrs. Tripp was disappointed by the decision, but expected
to be charged.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the White House, representatives of Ms. Lewinsky nor
prosecutors in Starr's office would comment on the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The county's top prosecutor, Marna McLendon, said the decision
to prosecute followed a year-long investigation into the matter
that was followed by a dispassionate analysis of the facts and law.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the county had ``never had a case like
this,'' she said that prosecutors had no choice but to investigate.
``Lots of people knew these tapes were allegedly made,'' she said,
adding, ``Prosecutors can't turn away. The public is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McLendon said that prosecutors considered Mrs. Tripp's
possible defenses before concluding that the charges could be
proven beyond a reasonable doubt. But several potential legal
hurdles could seriously complicate the prosecution, like the
immunity agreement that Mrs. Tripp obtained from federal
prosecutors before she agreed to become a witness for Starr.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Stephen Montanarelli, the state prosecutor who
conducted the investigation, acknowledged that the broad federal
immunity grant could pose difficulties for state prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immunity will be a problem, but we will face it in the
future,'' he said, suggesting that it would be an issue for the
trial judge to resolve.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Legal experts said that a federal immunity deal does not
absolutely insulate Mrs. Tripp from a state prosecution such as she
now faces in Maryland, but does indirectly offer some protection.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McLendon, the top prosecutor in the county in which Mrs.
Tripp resides, turned the inquiry over to Montanarelli, who heads
an office of the State Attorney General that investigates cases of
public corruption and white collar crime cases.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McLendon said Friday that with her decision to transfer the
case to Montanarelli, ``the cloud of partisan emotion has been
removed.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews earlier this year, Mrs. Tripp said that she had
sought to protect Ms. Lewinsky as a surrogate mother and feared at
times that the younger woman was so distraught about her
relationship with Clinton that she might do herself harm. She said
she betrayed Ms. Lewinsky only to save her from being abused by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp said in interviews that she made the secret
recordings and the decision to turn the tapes over to Starr's
prosecutors out of a combination of fear and outrage over the
president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In one interview she said that she believed that Clinton was
communicating through Ms. Lewinsky ``threats to my life, threats to
the lives of my children,'' an assertion that the White House
officials dismissed as ludicrous.

DAY TRADING'S UNDERBELLY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Few, if any, people have ever quit their day jobs to
go to Las Vegas and earn a living playing blackjack. So why have
thousands of people from many walks of life decided to junk their
jobs and trade stocks all day to pay the mortgage and the gas bill?
</P>
<P>
   The question is surely crossing the minds of many who first
learned about day trading on Thursday as the nightmarish story of
the Atlanta brokerage-office shootings unfolded. Day traders buy
and sell stocks by computer many times during the day to try to
capitalize on tiny price movements.
</P>
<P>
   Well before the shocking news from Atlanta, the increasing
popularity of day trading in recent years mystified many Wall
Street professionals. After all, trading stocks profitably is a
mighty difficult business that has humbled even the most
experienced and knowledgeable traders.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading is, first and foremost, an outgrowth of the almost
decade-long bull market in stocks. Because most day traders try to
ride stocks that are rising, if shares were falling, the practice
would be ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   But day trading is much more than a bull-market phenomenon.
Indeed, its popularity is very much a fin de siecle happening.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading has at its heart two very current American loves:
technology and the promise it holds, and the
do-it-yourself-investing craze.
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't like to think that she could beat the professionals
at their own game? And if the pitch is that advanced computer
technology now puts the game of investing on a level playing field
for individual investors, an otherwise skeptical person might warm
to the concept.
</P>
<P>
   But when the day-trading phenomenon ends _ and end it will _ its
legacy could be investor losses exceeding even those taken by
people in the 1987 crash.
</P>
<P>
   What is particularly offensive about many of the firms
specializing in day trading today are their claims to be helping
the small investor beat out the big guys on Wall Street. Make no
mistake: these firms are really in the business of getting clients
to trade, and to pay commissions of as much as $25 a transaction
for the privilege. Whether the trades turn out to be home runs or
debacles is almost beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   In their eagerness to keep day traders active and interested,
regulators say, many of these firms minimize the risks associated
with day trading. Here's what the books, Web sites and gushing
media stories about day trading don't tell investors.
</P>
<P>
   The practice has exceptionally high washout rates. Regulators
who have examined the books of day-trading firms say that more than
9 out of 10 traders wind up losing money. Because most of these
people disappear quietly when their cash runs out, few who replace
them in the trading rooms know about them or their failures.
</P>
<P>
   Securities cops also say that some day-trading houses skirt
margin rules, lending investors more than the 50 percent of the
value of securities in a purchase that is the limit recommended by
the Federal Reserve Board. With the extra money, customers who
would otherwise have their positions liquidated by the firm to
satisfy margin requirements get to keep trading and generating
commissions to the brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   But excessive borrowing means that these traders can lose much
more than their original investments if their stocks go down. They
can wind up not just wiped out but deeply in debt to the
day-trading house.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators also say that some day-trading houses ignore
requirements that people who trade money on behalf of friends,
relatives or strangers register as investment advisers. If they
register, they are required to disclose the risks of any investing
strategies they pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say that such disclosures are not being made by day
traders. Another issue state officials want addressed is how those
people trading for others are being compensated.
</P>
<P>
   State securities regulators in Massachusetts and Texas have
already brought several actions against day-trading firms. And
these probably won't be the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day-trading firms have got to do a better job of disclosing
the risks as well as screening their customers,'' said Marc
Beauchamp, spokesman at the North American Securities
Administrators Association. ``Until they do, they should expect
more enforcement actions.''

NO CRIMINAL CHARGES IN FATAL FALL OF WRESTLER OWEN HART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird
announced Friday that he would not file criminal charges in the
death of professional wrestler Owen Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City police investigated the case after Hart fell more
than 70 feet May 23 while waiting to be lowered into the ring at
Kemper Arena. Hart, 34, died in a World Wrestling Federation show
after a quick-release mechanism on his harness opened.
</P>
<P>
   Beaird said the police investigation centered on a rigger who
set up the stunt and the possible charge was involuntary
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Beaird said the legal requirement for the charge was
``substantial and unjustifiable risk of death, (and) that such risk
was disregarded, and that such disregard was a gross deviation from
what a reasonable person would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaird called the death an accident and said there was no
evidence of a crime. He declined to reveal details of the
investigation or comment on a pending wrongful-death lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in Jackson County Circuit Court on behalf
of Hart's widow, Martha Hart, their two children, ages 7 and 3, and
Owen Hart's parents, all of Calgary, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit lists 13 defendants, including the World Wrestling
Federation. Among the allegations was that the quick-release
mechanism was defective and that the stunt was dangerous and poorly
planned.
</P>
<P>
   World Wrestling Federation spokesman Jim Byrne said Friday: ``We
applaud the decision which confirms what we've believed all along.
That is, none of our actions were negligent.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrne declined to comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Robb, attorney for the Hart family, spoke for his clients
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appreciate the professionalism of the KCPD and the
prosecutor's office,'' Robb said, but ``their decision in no way
excuses the WWF from civil liability. We plan to move aggressively
forward.''

COLOMBIA'S PASTRANA URGES PATIENCE IN SOLVING COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 1) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ A popular Colombian cartoonist likes to draw
President Andres Pastrana as a pint-sized politician lost in the
folds of a huge suit of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Fairly or not, this notion that the job is too big for the man
appears to be spreading. As Colombia's civil war intensifies and as
the country's economy sinks, public support for Pastrana, who was
sworn in one year ago this month, is evaporating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in office almost a year, and nothing is going
well,'' said Joel Korn, a Colombia representative for the
Inter-American Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a recent Gallup poll that put Pastrana's job-approval
rating at just 16 percent, he was upbeat during an interview last
week with foreign correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, a 44-year-old former TV reporter, senator and Bogota
mayor, said that Colombians must not expect quick fixes to problems
that have plagued this nation of 38 million people for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are on the right path, and that's why we are
telling the Colombian people that they must have patience,'' said
Pastrana. ``The truth is that, during this first year, we have
begun to put the house in order.''
</P>
<P>
   After handily winning the 1998 election and taking the oath of
office Aug. 7 for a four-year term, Pastrana set out to polish
Colombia's battered image.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing President Ernesto Samper was accused of accepting $6.1
million from the Cali drug cartel when he defeated Pastrana in the
1994 election. The U.S. State Department blacklisted Colombia as
uncooperative in the war on drugs, and the Clinton administration
imposed economic sanctions. Foreign leaders shunned Samper and
canceled state visits to Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, over the course of 18 trips abroad, has forged close
ties to the Clinton administration as well as with European and
Asian governments. He has attracted billions of dollars in foreign
aid and investment.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in five years, Colombia received full
``certification`` from the State Department this year as a drug-war
ally. And unlike Samper, Pastrana is viewed as honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we feel proud to be Colombians, to be able to travel
around the world, and to be received in the White House,'' Pastrana
said. ``We are viewed in a totally different light.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pastrana was elected largely on his promises to direct an
economic recovery and to end the 35-year war against Marxist
rebels. Analysts say the president is foundering on both issues.
</P>
<P>
   To convince the rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, to negotiate, Pastrana ventured into the jungle
to meet with the group's reclusive leader Manuel ``Sureshot''
Marulanda. In a goodwill gesture, the Colombian president also
withdrew government troops from an expanse of land in southern
Colombia the size of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of talking, the rebels have used the demilitarized
zone to launch attacks, run drugs and hide kidnapping victims.
During a rebel raid last month, the guerrillas came within 25 miles
of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   Such rebel abuses and the lack of any concessions from the FARC
prompted Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda, one of Pastrana's most
respected Cabinet members, to step down in May. Hundreds of
military officers threatened to resign in solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pastrana has spent all of his time hugging `Sureshot.' All
they do is pat each other on the back,'' said Pablo Romero, who
owns a hardware store in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to negotiate with the National Liberation Army, a
smaller rebel group, broke off after the guerrillas hijacked an
Avianca domestic flight in April and kidnapped more than 100
worshippers in May during Mass at a church in Cali.
</P>
<P>
   Now, support for negotiations is flagging. In a poll of
Colombians by Semana magazine, 68 percent disapproved of the way
Pastrana has handled the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that the government is gearing up for a
wider war, a strategy known as ``Plan B.'' During a visit to
Washington last month, Colombian officials requested $500 million
in military aid from Washington over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   However, Pastrana claims that there is no ``Plan B.'' He also
said that snags in the peace process must be expected and that
initiatives to end other wars have dragged on for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Vietnam War, it took two years just to form the
negotiating table,'' Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are waiting for are small gestures of peace'' by the
FARC, he said. ``I have made good on my word and on what we have
promised to the FARC. That's why we hope that Sureshot honors his
word and his promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Ruiz, the government's planning director and a close
friend of the president's insists that Pastrana is convinced that
his government must search for peace. ``But he never said that he
would make peace in one year,'' Ruiz added. ``He is not naive.''
</P>
<P>
   While many Colombians believed all along that the peace process
could turn into a frustrating and drawn-out affair, few forecasted
the nation's deep economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of robust growth, the economy's Gross Domestic
Product _ the total output of goods and services produced within
the country _ is expected to shrink by as much as 2 percent this
year. It would be Colombia's worst economic performance since the
Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pastrana took office, unemployment has jumped to 19
percent from 15 percent, while the Colombian peso has lost
one-third of its value against the U.S. dollar. Romero, the
hardware store owner, said that his sales are down this year by 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president knows that people are suffering,'' Ruiz said.
``Every day he asks me: `When will the economy start growing? When
will we see results?'''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the problems, such as a 5 percent budget deficit, were
inherited from the Samper administration and have forced the
government to cut spending and enact other unpopular austerity
measures.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the western coffee-growing region was rocked by an
earthquake that killed more than 1,000 people, left 250,000
homeless and caused $1.5 billion in damages. Colombia also was hurt
by a series of bank failures and the recession in neighboring
Brazil, which provoked capital flight throughout Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pulling the country out of bankruptcy,'' Pastrana said.
``It would be easy to take short-term measures in order to win more
support. But one must not govern on the basis of public opinion
polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's economic plan has won the backing of financial
organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund, which agreed last month to extend Colombia a $3 billion line
of credit.
</P>
<P>
   Even opposition politicians say that there are few alternatives.
But some believe that Pastrana should have seen the crisis coming
and complain that he ignored problems at home while spending much
of his time traveling overseas.

   Part of the problem, others say, is that Pastrana has surrounded
himself with close friends rather than naming seasoned politicians
to high government posts. In recent months, there have been rumors
that Pastrana is preparing to sack most of his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, the son of a former president, is often described as
being somewhat arrogant and out-of-touch with average Colombians.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most common errors of presidents is that they lose
contact with reality,'' according to Juan Manuel Santos, a former
presidential candidate. ``They are closed off in a glass house and
only listen to those they want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana admits that his job is turning out to be more difficult
than he expected. But he also says Colombians should take stock of
his performance once he has completed his term in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult time due to everything that is happening
to us,`` Pastrana said. ``But we know where we are going, we have
international backing, and we will move forward. I insist that
presidents should be judged at the end of their term and not at the
beginning.''

LETTER: SHOOTER KILLED KIDS TO SAVE THEM FROM LIFE OF PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GA-SHOOT-RDP) 
(rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a letter and the texts of three
notes apparently written by Mark O. Barton and left in the Barton
home, as read by Chief Jimmy Mercer of the Henry County police and
recorded by The New York Times. Mercer said that the letter was
dated July 29, 6:38 a.m., and that he was omitting three telephone
numbers of people mentioned at the end of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   THE LETTER
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Ann is in the master bedroom closet under a blanket. I
killed her on Tuesday night. I killed Matthew and Mychele Wednesday
night. There may be similarities between these deaths and the death
of my first wife, Deborah Spivey. However, I deny killing her and
her mother. There is no reason for me to lie now. It just seemed
like a quiet way to kill and a relatively painless way to die.
There was little pain. All of them were dead in less than five
minutes. I hit them with the hammer in their sleep and then put
them face-down in the bathtub to make sure they did not wake up in
pain, to make sure they were dead.
</P>
<P>
   I'm so sorry. I wish I didn't. Words cannot tell the agony. Why
did I? I have been dying since October. Wake up at night so afraid,
so terrified that I couldn't be that afraid while awake. It has
taken its toll. I have come to hate this life in this system of
things. I have come to have no hope. I killed the children to
exchange them for five minutes of pain or a lifetime of pain. I
forced myself to do it to keep them from suffering so much later.
No mother, no father, no relatives. The fears of the father are
transferred to the son. It was from my father to me and from me to
my son. He already had it. And now to be left alone. I had to take
him with me.
</P>
<P>
   I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for
my demise. ... I know that Jehovah will take care of all of them in
the next life. I'm sure the details don't matter. There is no
excuse, no good reason I am sure no one will understand. If they
could I wouldn't want them to. I just write these things to say
why. Please know that I love Leigh Ann, Matthew and Mychele with
all my heart. If Jehovah's willing I would like to see them all
again in the resurrection to have a second chance. I don't plan to
live very much longer, just long enough to kill as many of the
people that greedily sought my destruction.
</P>
<P>
   THE NOTES
</P>
<P>
   I give you my wife Leigh Ann Vanderver Barton, my honey, my
precious love. Please take care of her. I will love her forever.
</P>
<P>
   I give you Matthew David Barton, my son, my buddy, my life.
Please take care of him.
</P>
<P>
   I give you Mychele Elizabeth Barton, my daughter, my sweetheart,
my life. Please take care of her.

 (Repeating for all needing)  
 (For release Sunday, August 01, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aug. 1 is the date traditionally reserved for writing about
summer reading, but I suggest that you pick up a thriller instead
of a business book. Myself, I am reading ``Charlotte Gray,'' by
Sebastian Faulks, a provocative novel of England and France during
World War II. ``A Dangerous Friend,'' about Vietnam, by Ward Just,
is next on my list.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though really good books about business and
economics are hard to find. Edward Chancellor's ``Devil Take The
Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation'' is elegant and
edifying. And Niall Ferguson's long but lively ``The House of
Rothschild: Money's Prophets 1798-1848'' rests heavy on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But I have something else in mind. ``The Frontiers of Research
in Economic Theory: The Nancy L. Schwartz Memorial Lectures,
1983-1997'' (Cambridge University Press, paperback) is not beach
reading, unless you are genuinely curious about where technical
economics is going.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are fortunate enough to belong to a reading group
whose purpose is to stiffen the resolve of members to undertake
somewhat harder tasks, then it is the best thing to come along in a
good many years. Indeed, if you abstain from heavy reading this
summer and invest an equivalent amount of time this fall, it will
stand you in good stead for many years into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Schwartz, fresh out of Oberlin College, spent the early
1960s doing a dissertation at Purdue University on the optimal
scheduling of tugboats and barges along a river with multiple
branches. That may sound kind of tame, until you reflect that such
planning techniques have great practical value in industry. It got
her hired to teach at Carnegie Mellon University in 1964 _ part of
an influx of economic talent that included Robert Lucas, Thomas
Sargent, Lester Lave, and Robert Kaplan, among many others.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the years in which knowledge of mathematical
programming was exploding among scientists and engineers. Amid
great excitement, the new techniques were being applied for the
first time to all kinds of economic problems involving sequential
choices _ even those involving expectations. The painfully shy
Schwartz formed a working partnership with the voluble Morton
Kamien, and together they applied the new mathematical tools to
problems of innovation and market structure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 the pair moved to Nortwestern, and a significant part of
the reason the Kellogg Graduate School of Management ascended to
the top ranks of business schools, a rival to Stanford and Harvard,
stemmed from Schwartz's stewardship of its PhD program. Top-flight
economists came and went, but mostly stayed. In 1981, Kamien and
Schwartz published ``Dynamic Optimization: Calculus of Variations
and Optimal Control in Economics and Management Science.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, without warning, and for no apparent reason, Schwartz took
her own life. She was 41. Her friends, led by Kamien, decided that
a distinguished lecture series would be the best memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The first lecturer in 1983 was Hugo Sonnenshein, Schwartz's
Purdue classmate. (Sonnenschein has let it be known that he will
step down as president of the University of Chicago next year.)
</P>
<P>
   In a 1983 talk called ``The Economics of Incentives,''
Sonnenschein surveyed a 50-year difference of opinion about the
provision of public goods. Paul Samuelson had been too pessimistic
about the ease with which sidewalks and streetlights would be
forthcoming, believing that government nearly always must be
involved; Ronald Coase had been too sanguine, arguing that citizens
would nearly always bargain out matters for themselves. Specialists
in the new field of mechanism design would have a field day in the
years ahead, Sonnenshein predicted _ and so they have.
</P>
<P>
   There have followed sixteen annual lectures by some of the
foremost names in scientific economics. Fourteen are collected in
this book. Andreu Mas-Colell on theory of perfect competition;
Menahem Yaari on the role of ``Dutch books'' in choice under risk;
Robert Aumann on the formal possibilities flowing out of the
psychological assumptions known as ``bounded rationality;'' Lucas
on the economics of new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are Truman Bewley on the differences between risk
and uncertainty; Reinhard Selten on evolution and learning; Vernon
Smith on experimental economics; Gary Becker on the significance of
habits, addictions, and traditions; Robert Wilson on negotiation in
litigation and strikes; Roy Radner on economic survival; Peter
Diamond on the nature of social insurance; Nancy Stokey on the
economics of social mobility; and David Kreps on learning to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   None of these essays is what you would call journalistic. Most
contain some mathematics and some contain a lot. Almost all,
however, are written in clear language that will be accessible to
anyone with a fond memory of college-level economics.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest is Yaari's talk about the significance of those
complicated heads-I-win-tails-you-lose contracts known to
speculators as ``Dutch books.'' The freshest is Wilson's essay on
pitfalls in the analysis of signaling. The most recent talks (not
included in the book) have been by Ariel Rubinstein on language as
a bargaining problem and Joseph Stiglitz on bankruptcy and
development.
</P>
<P>
   There is no synthesizing hand at work in this volume, though the
emphasis on the use of the most promising mathematical and game
theoretic tools narrows the focus a good bit.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation list also reflects a determination to showcase
important work somewhat more quickly than usually has been required
to become a Famous Economist _ witness the fact that only three of
the Schwartz lecturers have as yet been awakened by a call from
Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Northwestern is pleased. The community of
lecturers ``is like a family,'' says Kellogg school dean Donald
Jacobs who, with Kamien and Ehud Kalai, edited the volume.
</P>
<P>
   I'm satisfied too. But on my Michigan beach, I plan to
contemplate risk and uncertainty, addiction and tradition, in
strictly anecdotal form.

 &HT;    Criticism about Alabama case
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy and Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Capt. Jerry Wynn spent Friday morning crying, dwelling
on the bitter should-haves and could-haves surrounding the 1993
slayings of Debra Barton and her mother, Eloise Spivey.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn, a Douglas County investigator and veteran of many
successful homicide prosecutions, said he knew from the start that
Mark O. Barton was the killer and even compiled plenty of damning
evidence on the suspect. But he said he watched helplessly in
mounting frustration as an out-of-state department with
jurisdiction in the case conducted an investigation he calls
pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed seasoned investigators from the start; if they did
so, 12 people wouldn't be dead today,'' said Wynn, who was in a
Texas motel watching CNN when he saw Barton's photo flash across
the screen as the Atlanta massacre was broadcast worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The two dead women ``deserved a better investigation than they
got,'' said Wynn, who works in the county where the Barton and the
Spivey families lived. ``But in rural America, you're not assured
of a proper investigation if there's a homicide. Sometimes it's up
to dirt-road deputies.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Dell, district attorney in Cherokee County, Alabama,
where the murders occurred, called the accusations ``bunk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see part of the impetus behind this is Bill Spivey. His wife
and daughter were the ones killed by Mr. Barton. But he was a
strong supporter of Mr. Barton in the early going,'' said O'Dell.
`` If he thinks there's a ton of evidence against his son-in-law,
then perhaps he should find some solace in the fact that his
son-in-law has paid the ultimate price for his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1993, the two women were beaten to death in a
trailer at Weiss Lake in Cherokee County, a northern Alabama county
with 22,000 residents where the Spiveys were on a fishing getaway.
The sheriff's department overseeing the investigation had just 15
lawmen _ including the sheriff _ and only one detective at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn and Douglas County Sheriff Tommy Waldrop have a list of
complaints about the Alabama investigation:
</P>
<P>
   _ Wynn said Cherokee investigators called Barton to come to the
murder scene, but then allowed him leave with his car. ``They said
(to Barton), `Don't clean this car.' They did not process it
then,'' said Wynn. ``When they did process the car, it was
spotless.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Wynn said the Alabama department did not retrieve a ``box of
love letters'' between Barton and his mistress that Wynnlocated in
Macon.
</P>
<P>
   _ A company that manufactures Luminol, a solvent used by
detectives to find traces of blood at crime scenes, called Wynn to
say Barton was calling them asking them questions about their
product. Wynn said that lead was not followed up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wynn said it was he, not Cherokee investigators, who
discovered that Barton had just taken out a $600,000 policy on his
wife several weeks before she was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Cherokee County officials could not be reached for comment
Friday evening on those criticisms. Earlier in the day, O'Dell did
take issue with Waldrop's contention that Cherokee officials
bristled when Douglas investigators called to offer help or
sugestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we'd call them, it would irritate them,'' said
Waldrop, who said the Alabama investigators did not have strong
emotional ties to the case. ``The victims were just not from that
area. And they had another case they were investigating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We never blocked anybody; we asked for any help we could
get,'' said O'Dell. ``We took whatever help and information we
could get from any quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, as in Georgia, small law enforcement agencies
feeling overmatched by major crimes like a homicide can call the
state's bureau of investigation. But Alabama state authorities said
Cherokee investigators did not call them for more than half a year.
``We did not handle that case; we did not collect any evidence in
this,'' said Alabama Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Mary
Hasselwander. ``The Department of Public Safety routinely assists
counties in their investigations. But that is done at the request
of the local authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherokee County did not seek assistance from the ABI until April
1994, said Hasselwander. That request came only after then-Georgia
Gov. Zell Miller asked GBI officials to contact their Alabama
counterparts and ask if they or the Cherokee authorities needed
assistance. Miller had been contacted by Spivey, a Lithia Springs
resident who believed Barton killed his wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Spivey was terribly frustrated because there was no
cooperation between law enforcement there and here,'' said Dennis
Chandler, a former state representative from Douglasville who went
to bat for the Spiveys. ``They made it clear it wasn't Georgia's
jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wynn said that GBI investigators did canvass Barton's home
in Lithia Springs and his car. There were chemical reactions to
blood in the sinks, in the carport and light traces in the car. GBI
spokesman John Bankhead said the agent who conducted those tests
told him Friday that he turned those findings over to Cherokee
County authorities at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Wilson, a Cherokee sheriff's office investigator, said
there was no physical evidence. ``All we have is circumstantial
evidence and that's all we've had from the start. There was nothing
that we could recover (from the crime scene).''
</P>
<P>
   Wynn said Barton was having an affair with Leigh Ann Lang before
his first wife's slaying. Wynn said he talked to acquaintances of
Barton who reported a chilling prediction. ``In June, (Barton) put
his arm around Leigh Ann and said to these witnesees, `We'll be
together by October.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cherokee district attorney's investigator Danny Smith said he
shared the Georgia authorities' belief that Barton was the killer.
When he talked to Lang at the time, he said,``At the conclusion of
the the interview I told her then, whenever she ceased to fill his
needs, then he'd kill her too.''
</P>
<P>
   Said investigator Smith, ``My personal feelings from the very
beginning of our investigation was that Mark Barton was dangerous
and his potential to kill again was very high. I also felt that his
potential for suicide was very high. As it turned out, both of
those feelings were right.''

 &HT;    Make-or-break world of day trading broke for Barton
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thursday's shootings shined an unwanted light on a
high-stakes way to make it or break it: day trading.
</P>
<P>
   The man identified as the shooter, Mark O. Barton, was a day
trader. He had lost a total of $105,000 over a period of 15 days,
ending July 27, at one of the two day-trading establishments he
used.
</P>
<P>
   A number of eye witnesses to the shootings said Barton talked
about losing money while he was shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, traders bantering in chat rooms discussed the shootings.
One posting asked whether ``the wild risks and intense pressures of
market speculation'' were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Atlanta killings are not surprising'' said another member
of the Lakeside Trading Club. ``It was only a matter of time before
someone who blew out their account couldn't handle the stress and
took it out on innocent victims.''
</P>
<P>
   However, James Lee, president of Momentum Securities where
Barton traded as late as Tuesday, said Friday in a statement that
Barton had _ as all traders do _ signed documents saying he
understood the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to remember, the trading decisions he made
were his own,'' said Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading is not investing; it's more speculative than that.
</P>
<P>
   It is an intricately complex way to try to stay a split-second
ahead of the direction of a stock price. Day traders feed off a
stock's volatile intraday movement. The shares most often traded
are technology stocks, most of which are on the NASDAQ market,
which processes trades electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders typically work out of places like All-Tech
Investment Group and Momentum Securities, the Atlanta businesses
where Barton traded. These companies provide staff to help the
traders and dedicated computers loaded with software on which to
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The typical day trader tends to focus on a handful of companies
and to buy and sell those stocks many times in a single session to
take advantage of spikes in the prices. At the end of the day, the
trader cashes out, returning the next day to roll the dice again.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Bourquin, a 30-year old California day trader, said traders
get a feel for a stock's direction by watching what market makers
do.
</P>
<P>
   Market makers are brokerage firms that keep an inventory in a
particular stock to sell to customers. They buy or sell stock to
keep an orderly market. Watching the market makers lets traders
like Bourquin stay a step ahead of the general public. That step
might be only a few-minutes lead, but for a day trader, who can
make a trade in a second, a minute is plenty.
</P>
<P>
   The losses and gains can be huge, but almost all traders lose
money in their first few months, Borquin said. The ones who last a
year tend to make a living, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bourquin, like many day traders, worried that the actions of one
man would stain an industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew people would try and make this a day trader thing,''
Bourquin said. ``But it probably had nothing to do with it, or very
little. This guy was just a lunatic. He could have been a mechanic
or a doctor. What happened in Atlanta has more to do with him being
a lunatic than him being a day trader.''
</P>
<P>
   How difficult is day trading? Here are some answers to commonly
asked questions about day trading, compiled with the help of David
Floyd, a partner at San Diego-based careerdaytrader.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do day traders know which way a stock will go?
</P>
<P>
   A: They don't. Many day traders, however, keep a keen eye on S&AMP;P
futures. The reason? The prices of these tradeable futures
contracts and the actual index normally shadow each other quite
closely. When the gap between the futures and the index narrows or
widens, day traders see this as a buy or sell signal. Successful
day traders rarely bet against this market gauge. They buy shares
when the futures suggest the market will rise. Sometimes they're
right. Sometimes they're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the attraction?
</P>
<P>
   A: Consider the case of IBM, which fell $3 on Thursday to close
at $125.38. A normal investor who owned 100 shares of IBM lost
$300. But a day trader could have ``shorted'' 100 shares of IBM _ a
bet that the stock would fall, and the only strategy to follow on a
day when the S&AMP;P 500 was falling _ until it reached its lowest
point. That day trader could have made as much as $400.

 &HT;    Anderson talks are going nowhere
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Jamal Anderson wasn't here again Friday. He
probably won't be here today, and from the sound of his agent, he
might not ever return to the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   With Jim Sims heading to Europe Friday and his client home in
Salt Lake City tending to a concert thrown today by his ``Jam
Entertainment'' company, things don't look rosy.
</P>
<P>
   Sims spoke by phone with Falcons general manager Harold
Richardson at least twice Friday, but had nothing to report.
</P>
<P>
   And as trade speculation continued involving the Washington
Redskins and new rumors popped up involving Miami, Chicago,
Carolina and even Pittsburgh, Sims sounded more disappointed than
he has in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Falcons coach Dan Reeves said the teams most
recent offer is off the table, and there would be no more
negotiation until Anderson reports to training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Sims said Anderson is not showing up until he is promised a new
deal will be done by the start of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's not making that promise. It's not clear, in fact,
what he's talking about on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole tone may change from trying to get a deal done to
trying to get a trade done so he can play somewhere in 1999,'' Sims
said. ``I'm not strongly asking for that yet, but I have asked for
permission to participate in any trade discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, though, it is in the best interest of both parties
for Jamal to remain a Falcon.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said the only team that he had contact with regarding
Anderson was the Redskins. ``(Coach) Norv Turner called me at home
(before camp),'' Reeves said. ``I made it clear Jamal is not
available. I haven't talked to any of those other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he hasn't talked to those teams, either.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as Sims departed for a two-week European vacation, he
said Richardson has his phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I indicated to them, we're going to be very patient,'' Sims
said. ``This whole deal has very serious career implications for
Jamal. The longer it gets before something is resolved, the more
acrimonious it becomes, and the it doesn't endear the Falcons to
Jamal or Jamal to the Falcons.

 &HT;    Picking Falcons was easy for Carter
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Marty Carter won't be able to look forward to
his mother's meals after home games this year, but the Falcons' new
strong safety is hardly complaining.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-year veteran, he spent the past four seasons playing
for the Chicago Bears, and when Ellen Dunlap would visit, game day
often would be too cold for her. The Windy City, after all, is a
bit cooler in the winter than Carter's native LaGrange.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd come up (to Chicago) and stay at my apartment and just
cook,'' said Carter, whose half-brother, Dell McGee, is a
cornerback on the Lions' roster. ``It would be 30-below with the
wind chill. When I committed to Atlanta, I called her, and I heard
a `thump.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `What happened?' and she said, `I fell off the sofa.'
She was so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons can't help but be happy to have the 6-foot-1,
212-pound Carter, who led the Bears in tackles three of his four
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He's faster and bigger than former strong safety William White,
who came off the field in passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Carter, 29, was a rookie in 1991 with Tampa Bay,
he chased down former Falcons defensive back/wide receiver Deion
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a preseason game, and Deion caught a pass,'' Carter
said. ``He thought nobody was near him and he started doing that
strut. I collared him at the 2-(yard line). I love to say I caught
Deion from behind. I've got it on video.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons gave Carter a five-year, $15 million contract with a
$2.6 million signing bonus. In exchange, they get a player who
isn't expected to leave the field in passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you replace a guy like William, who did a good job
for us, you're looking for the same kind of leadership and some
sort of (additional) upside,'' secondary coach Ron Meeks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting old, especially at safety with Eugene
(Robinson, who is 36), and William (33). Marty is younger, and he's
a big, physical guy with playmaking ability.''
</P>
<P>
   After last season, when he became an unrestricted free agent,
Carter had just visited New Orleans and was getting ready to visit
Baltimore when his agent, Kennard McGuire, called.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said Atlanta called and had good things to say. He said I
should stop by,'' said the former eighth-round draft choice out of
Middle Tennessee State. ``Coach (Dan) Reeves and (secondary) Coach
Meeks ... made an impression on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a team that ... had the personnel to be a contender
for years to come. Plus, I was so eager to play at home near family
and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   So Carter, who lives in Marietta, never made it to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, a lot of his family and friends will be able to see him
play. When the Bears played the Falcons last season in the Georgia
Dome, ``I had to get like 74 tickets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let me put a complimentary message on the Jumbotron
because I bought so many.''

EVOLVING ANSWERS TO THE WHY OF SUICIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There is but one truly serious philosophical problem,'' Albert
Camus said, ``and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is
not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Suicide has become more than a philosophical question, however.
This week, Dr. David Satcher, the U.S. surgeon general, declared it
a serious public health threat, with the number of reported
suicides among children doubling over the last 20 years. At the
same time, in Japan, statistics show a record increase in suicide
as that country copes with economic recession.
</P>
<P>
   But some social scientists believe that the apparent increase in
numbers, at least in the United States, is due to increased
reporting with the lessening of social sanctions against suicide.
``We now have an increase because we see depression and suicide as
the result of a chemical imbalance,'' said Howard I. Kushner, a
professor at San Diego State University, the author of ``Self
Destruction in the Promised Land,'' (Rutgers University Press,
1989), a history of suicide in America. ``It's legitimized because
it's biological.''
</P>
<P>
   Social attitudes determine how suicide is reported, Kushner
said, continuing, ``One reason we hear about it in Japan is that it
is sanctioned.'' He was referring to the tradition of hara kiri, or
honorable suicide, when a person is shamed or has failed in his
responsibility to others. Social attitudes can also decide what is
considered suicide, he said: ``Risking your life jumping into a
pond can be seen as suicide or as an act of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether there is an actual increase in suicide or better
reporting of it, attitudes toward suicide are a reflection of moral
belief, medical theory and cultural forces, and they are constantly
evolving.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide remains to some extent a taboo, Kushner said, seen as a
violation of natural law and a mark of shame for the families of
those who take their own lives. ``When people die of suicide, our
reaction is to feel anger, grief, responsibility,'' Kushner said.
``Suicides are seen as judgments on the people left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes toward suicide stand in the way of treating
serious depression, said Kay Redfield Jamison, a professor of
psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and
author of the forthcoming ``Night Falls Fast: Understanding
Suicide.'' ``In the United States, we regard it as a highly
individual act. We tend not to see it as a cause of mortality, as
we do cancer or heart disease. We see it less as an illness than as
a consequence of social and relationship issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``History of Suicide,'' the French scholar Georges Minois
traces the way attitudes toward suicide have evolved from the
classical period into the modern world. Suicide seems so deeply
threatening at least partly because it is an assertion of
individual freedom against the power of the state, Minois writes:
``It is an affront to all political and religious systems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who chooses death and its unknowns displays a total
lack of confidence in the theories, ideologies, beliefs, plans and
promises of all leaders,'' he continues. As a consequence,
``whatever its nature, power seeks to prevent and conceal
suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a double standard in social attitudes
toward suicide, Minois says. In ancient Rome, there was the cult of
``the noble suicide,'' embodied in the deaths of Brutus, Cato,
Antony and Cleopatra. But suicide was also outlawed for slaves and
foot soldiers ``because a slave belongs to the owner and he doesn't
own his life,'' Minois, 53, explained in a telephone interview from
his home in Brittany. Slaves in ancient Greece were also prohibited
from killing themselves because they were essential for agriculture
and for the maintenance of the society, Minois said.
</P>
<P>
   The early Christians strengthened social sanctions against
suicide. There was the notion that ``God gave us life,'' Minois
said, and ``man hasn't got any right to take his own life.'' Still,
the Old Testament never specifically prohibits suicide, Minois
noted, only murder. In fact, the Old Testament is littered with the
dead bodies of heroes who took their own life _ Samson, for one,
who brought the palace of the Philistines down on his head as well
as theirs.
</P>
<P>
   It was St. Augustine who once and for all solidified the
Church's prohibition against suicide. The estates of those who
killed themselves were confiscated, and a stake was driven through
their bodies to keep them from rising up and haunting others with
their unquiet spirits. They were buried at crossroads under rocks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Minois says religion was not the only reason for the
prohibition. The Roman Empire was expanding into a totalitarian
system, and outlying regions were being colonized. The Christian
church's own land holdings had also increased. ``An acute shortage
of manpower dictated the requisitioning of all human lives for the
service of the economy and the defense of the empire,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Although sanctions against suicide were harsh during the
Medieval period, suicide for ``noble'' purposes was sometimes
glorified, in the case of knights who died in battle rather than
surrender, or in the case of the Christian martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   With the Renaissance came a shift in attitudes. ``It was a time
of great changes in values with the wars of religion,'' Minois
explained, ``the discovery of the New World, changes in economics,
capitalism.'' At the same time, he said, ``the medieval types of
family solidarity were becoming looser and looser, leaving the
individual more and more alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of suicide was widely discussed in the public
realm. In 1600, Hamlet asked what is essentially the first modern
question: ``To be or not to be?'' Self-destruction occurs no less
than 52 times in Shakespeare, Minois says.
</P>
<P>
   It is significant, he observes, that the word ``suicide'' does
not appear in English until the 1650s. The creation of a new word
marked the final separation of suicide from homicide, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Reformation and the Enlightenment brought another shift in
attitudes. Religion itself was being re-examined. For the Deists,
God was not a vengeful figure, and Deism reduced the fear of hell,
making death seem less fearsome. The British historian and
philosopher David Hume even wrote a pamphlet defending the right to
suicide, but at the last moment decided not to publish it. Still,
for the Puritans, suicide was the work of Satan.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1700s, suicide came to be known as ``The English
Malady,'' after a popular 1733 treatise by George Cheyne. England
was thought to have a particularly large number of cases because of
the bad climate and rich food. But Minois argues that the increase
was probably only apparent, due to the expansion of the popular
press and the frequent mention of the topic in it.
</P>
<P>
   The death of the poet Thomas Chatterton in 1770 made suicide
fashionable. And with the success of Goethe's ``Sorrows of Young
Werther,'' in 1774, the story of a young man who kills himself
because of his unrequited love for a married woman, the notion of
Romantic suicide was born. ``The figure of Werther arrived on the
scene just as the question of the legitimacy of voluntary death
reached an emotional high point,'' Minois writes.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, in Europe, suicide was attributed to insanity,
resulting in fewer draconian punishments for those who attempt it
or for the families of those who succeed. The leaders of the French
Revolution condemned suicide, because they saw the individual's
body as the property of the state. Nonetheless, sanctions against
suicide disappeared from the penal code after the Revolution in
1791. In other European countries, however, criminalization of
suicide continued into the mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1897, Emile Durkheim tried to find sociological causes for
suicide. People are more inclined to commit suicide when they are
not part of a strong social fabric, Durkheim wrote. At the same
time, Freud put forward a psychoanalytic explanation as aggression
turned inward.
</P>
<P>
   In his book on suicide in America, Howard Kushner describes the
way it was transformed there from a moral problem into a medical
one. This coincided with the rise of medicine as a profession, he
writes, and the substitution of the notion of mental illness for
immoral behavior. Doctors, Kushner argued, in an effort to increase
their power and influence, claimed suicide as a medical problem and
had an investment in saying it was treatable.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Arthur Kleinman, a professor of psychiatry and medical
anthropology at the Harvard Medical School, believes that seeing
depression _ and suicide _ as a medical problem alone strips
suffering of its moral and emotional importance. He cites as an
example the depression suffered by terminally ill people. In the
past, that depression has had a moral and religious purpose, as the
terminally ill look back on their lives, sometimes with regret and
apology to their loved ones for their shortcomings and failures. It
is an end-of-life ``conversation,'' Kleinman said, that has a
healing effect, and brings closure. But today, said Kleinman,
``somehow they are ill with clinical depression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should be careful before we label them depressed,''
Kleinman continued. With the medicalization of suffering, Kleinman
said, it is too often simply ``easier to give anti-depressants and
walk away.'' ``Often the most important thing,'' he said, ``is not
the anti-depressants, but that people can participate in the moral
and religious conversations of suffering at the end of life.''

THE GREAT PENNY SHORTAGE OF 1999 HITS NEW YORK

individual purchase by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
(DW) 
 By GLENN COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The long-maligned penny, kicked about the sidewalks
of New York, disparaged by the ``take a penny'' cups at cash
registers and mocked by the ``no pennies'' signs on bridge and
tunnel tollgates, is enjoying its revenge.
</P>
<P>
   New York is enduring the great penny shortage of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some city merchants are literally penniless, losing money by
rounding off customers' purchases. A McDonald's in Manhattan is
awarding free Big Macs to customers who bring in $10 worth of
pennies. The Chase Manhattan Bank is offering a 5-cent premium for
every 50-cent roll that customers deliver to the teller's window.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked all my employees to break their piggy banks and
bring in their pennies,'' said John Pourakis, manager of a Food
Emporium in Manhattan. ``We're going after pennies any way we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   The shortage, which is being felt in the five boroughs, is a
month old, but has worsened in the last two weeks, said Duane
Fingall, manager of the penny-hungry McDonald's at 51st Street and
Broadway, where those free Big Macs are being offered. ``Every day
at least one person comes in to take the offer,'' he said. ``I even
brought in a jar full of $40 worth of pennies myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The penny shortage ``is actually a penny imbalance,'' contended
Peter Bakstansky of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ``There
are plenty of pennies out there, but people are putting them into
bottles. They're just not in circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent study by Coinstar, the nation's largest
manufacturer of self-service coin-counting machines, two-thirds of
Americans do not regularly circulate their pennies, instead letting
coins accumulate on bedroom dressers or piggy banks. Some $7.7
billion worth of change is out of circulation for this reason,
Coinstar contends, with the typical American consumer stashing
about $30 worth of change.
</P>
<P>
   Penny-ante, short-lived penny shortages have recently been
reported in Albany, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago, St. Louis
and Cleveland, coin experts say. Now it's New York's turn.
</P>
<P>
   But why now? ``We're not at all sure why,'' said Bakstansky of
the Fed. ``There could be some seasonality to it, leading up to the
vacation period.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Mint will produce 13 billion pennies this year.
According to the Mint, projected coin demand is running 21 percent
above the all-time high of 19 billion coins in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   More than 426 pennies for each man, woman and child in the
nation are currently in circulation, according to the Mint, which
has produced more than 312 billion pennies during the last 30
years, 114 billion of which are now in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have contributed to the national pattern of
temporary shortages, experts say. Banks have been encouraging ATMs,
telephone and Internet banking. The booming economy has raised the
number of cash transactions, ``and that's creating a demand for
more change,'' said Dave Herrick, a spokesman for Coinstar, which
is based in Bellevue, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Herrick of Coinstar made some additional points. ``Americans are
increasingly time-starved,'' he said. ``Many don't want to sit at
the dining-room table anymore to count and wrap their coins and put
them in paper tubes, then stand in line at the bank to cash them
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that 75 percent of Americans accumulate all
forms of coins at home, while only 21 percent of the population
puts coins in wrappers and takes them to the bank. It takes 167
pennies to make a pound of coins.
</P>
<P>
   Coinstar has established its machines in 5,900 supermarkets in
38 states. The self-service machines count coins and reimburse
consumers for dumping coins in the hopper, after subtracting an 8.9
percent fee for the service. For the first time last May, Americans
put more coins back in circulation using coin-processing machines
than the U.S. Mint produced, according to Coinstar.
</P>
<P>
   Pourakis, the Food Emporium manager, pointed to his store's
large green-and-purple Coinstar change-counting machine. ``We're
practically tackling customers before they can use the machine, and
asking them if we can buy their pennies,'' he said with a laugh.
``Every penny counts.''

   Behind the Apple Of Many Eyes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer's iBook, introduced two weeks ago, has a high
``ooooh'' factor _ the involuntary reaction elicited from some
people when they see a thoughtfully designed product. The person
mainly responsible is Jonathan Ive, 32, a London native who is the
personal-computer industry's leading design rebel.
</P>
<P>
   To Ive, Apple's design director, the term ``generic'' is a
derogatory epithet, and he calls generic design (think beige box)
``the curse of computing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ive came to Apple in 1993, after working on the company's first
Powerbooks as a consultant at Tangerine, a London design firm. At
Apple, Ive gained added stature after Steven Jobs, a design zealot,
became acting chief executive two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's all over it from the beginning,'' Ive said of his boss'
interest in the look and feel of the products.
</P>
<P>
   A notebook cousin to Apple's popular iMac, the shell-shaped
iBook that Ive designed comes in blue and tangerine orange. It has
several other distinctive touches _ a swing-out handle, latch-free
opening and closing and a tiny red light that indicates that the
machine is in ``sleep mode'' by winking slowly, almost like a
heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-core nerds may regard such stuff as gimmickry. But Ive begs
to differ: ``As this technology becomes more pervasive _ the
computer more and more a consumer product _ design has got to
matter.''

   A Fond and Generous Farewell &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the employees of Thompson-McCully, one of the largest road
construction companies in the Midwest, received notes from Bob
Thompson, the owner, with their paychecks asking them to show up
one Saturday last month, they didn't know what to expect. They
arrived to hear executives say that Thompson wanted to thank them
for their role in building the company, which he had just sold to
Oldcastle Materials for $442 million.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked them by giving each of the 80 or so salaried
employees at least $1 million, and each hourly employee $2,000 for
every year with the company. In all, he gave his 550 employees $128
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask and demand of these people to go out every day and
perform well for me, and I wanted to show them I appreciate their
work,'' he said later in an interview. Sharing the proceeds ``isn't
going to change my life,'' he added ``but it's certainly going to
change theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson founded his company in Belleville, Mich., 40 years ago
with $3,500 of his wife's teaching salary. The new owners say they
plan no layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many longtime employees are Joanne Danlovich, a
$14-an-hour payroll administrator, who received a $40,000 check for
her 20 years. `It was such a surprise,'' she said. She plans to use
some of the money to pay for her granddaughter's braces.

   As the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Airlines, after the long,
sometimes bare-knuckled rule of Robert L. Crandall as chief
executive, Donald J. Carty is finding that glasnost can lead to
chaos (labor unrest, late flights, service with a snarl).
</P>
<P>
   Even events that seem foolproof have run into annoyances: At a
ceremony in March where Carty announced that Dallas' new arena
would be known as the American Airlines Center, one of the
airline's new Boeing 777s swooped so low over the site, dipping its
wing in salute to those attending, that traffic on a nearby freeway
was snarled and nervous residents called the city's emergency
number.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, however, a news conference to reveal the arena's
design, by the architect David M. Schwarz, went more smoothly (with
no flyovers). Carty was joined by Ross Perot Jr. and Thomas O.
Hicks, the arena partners. American's sponsorship of the arena will
cost about $190 million over 30 years. &QL;

   A State of Incubation &QL;
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, it seems, breeds not only banks _ including two
of the nation's six largest _ but also bankers. By being named the
next president of the First Union Corp. (No. 6) last week, G.

SCIENTISTS, UNIVERSITIES ALARMED BY FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
AMENDMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)  (mk) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The proposition is simple enough: Public dollars pay for a lot
of scientific research, so data from that research should be
available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., a law saying just
that passed quietly one evening last October, without hearings or
debate, as a one-sentence amendment to the 4,000-plus page
appropriations bill. Under the amendment, anyone can write a
request to the government under the Freedom of Information Act and
get ``all data produced'' by a published study paid for with any
public dollars, and potentially receive everything from a summary
of findings to a scientist's notebooks or e-mail or in some cases,
information about patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience has shown that transparency in government is a
principle that has improved decision-making and increased the
public's trust in government,'' Shelby stated in explaining the
law's premise. For too long, he said, Americans ``have been unable
to access federally funded research data despite the significant
impact of this data in the policy-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   The law has the U.S. Chamber of Commerce delighted. ``IN THE
REGULATORY REFORM ARENA THERE MAY NEVER BE A MORE IMPORTANT
ISSUE,'' its Web site reads, adding, ``This would be the first time
the business community has ever been provided with the basis for
the bureaucracy imposing $700 billion in annual regulatory costs on
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion: ``If implemented properly, this rule will do
more for regulatory reform than all the legislation passed in the
last 10 years!''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But scientists and university administrators, who took some time
to notice the law, are alarmed. They fear that corporate or
political interests will use the law to hamper research on
controversial subjects, tie up scientists in red tape, circumvent
confidentiality agreements and thwart government regulations. While
they agree with the general notion of giving the public access to
research data, they assert that any data from any study, no matter
how rigorous, can be made to appear questionable if examined by
hostile experts and publicists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now concluded that the legislation constitutes a broad
political attack on both science and on the federal regulatory
apparatus,'' Nils Hasselmo, president of the Association of
American Universities, said in a letter to Vice President Al Gore
on Wednesday. He added that ``we are very concerned that such an
effort could involve actions designed to discredit scientists and
discourage researchers from addressing controversial topics.''
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing about the law before a House subcommittee on
government management and technology earlier this month, scientists
recalled previous clashes between science and industry and said
they feared the law would increase such cases.
</P>
<P>
   In one example, Dr. Paul Fisher at the Medical College of
Georgia published a study in 1991 of what small children know about
tobacco brands. He found that Joe Camel was a figure known just as
well as Mickey Mouse by six-year-olds, and that they knew the
brands of cigarettes in some detail.
</P>
<P>
   RJ Reynolds decided it wanted to see Fisher's data and do its
own analysis. The company wanted not only all the raw data, but the
names and addresses of the children who were interviewed so the
company could go back to ``re-interview'' them. Fisher fought the
case in court, but ultimately the college's own president agreed
that the company should have access to the children. He resigned
from the college, and RJR got most of the data they wanted,
although it did not contact the children. The litigation dragged on
for years and made Fisher decide not to do research on tobacco
issues ever again.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the law dismiss the possibility of harassment. But
critics point out that Shelby started work on the amendment after
Harvard researchers, citing confidential patient information,
declined to give Congress their raw data in a two-decade-long
pollution study. The study, sponsored by the Environmental
Protection Agency, was instrumental in creating a 1997 federal
regulation that required stronger controls on sources of small
particle emissions, including cars and power plants. Among the
companies that testified against the regulation was Alabama Power
and Light.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Harvard compromised by giving the data to a
bipartisan group, funded by both EPA and the auto industry, which
is auditing the data and conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   After that episode, Shelby recommended that businesses be able
to get the raw data themselves for analysis and re-interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe that federally funded research data that is
used to drive public policy should be available to the taxpayers
who paid for it,'' he said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Casey, who as senior director of federal and state
relations at Harvard University was involved in the dispute over
the pollution study, called the Shelby amendment a backdoor attack
on regulations like the emissions rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about getting the public information,'' he said.
``It is about attacking regulations on pollution and other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the new regulation, Casey asserts, that under the guise
of sunshine laws the Republicans are able to attack environmental
laws without losing public support, as they have for their more
open challenges in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shelby amendment is a backdoor way to achieve same goal,''
Casey said. ``It allows company lawyers to harass scientists
collecting data on the most sensitive and controversial issues _
such as environmental health and pollution _ to slow down the
research used to make policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The real impact of the amendment will not be known until it goes
into effect later this year; it is now being formulated into
regulations by the Office of Management and Budget. Among the
questions facing the office is how to define ``data'' _ does it
mean blood samples and archeological finds as well as written work?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under a draft of the regulations, those who want data must ask
for it under the Freedom of Information Act, by submitting a
request to the agency that gave the grant to the scientist. The
scientist then would turn over all data _ including names and
addresses of patients and other private and commercially secret
information _ to the agency. Then, the FOIA office of that funding
agency would determine what must be given to the requestor and what
must be withheld. The information act carries protections against
giving out some kind of information, including commercial trade
secrets or financial data, personal information such as medical
records.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at the National Institutes of Health, the agency
that finances the largest percentage of biomedical research, said
they were concerned about the cost of collecting and storing all
the raw data. As it is, in fiscal year 1998, NIH's FOIA office had
20 full-time employees answering 1,200 requests at a cost of
$500,000. And despite the legal protections, administrators say
they worry, too, about the confidentiality of patient records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they redact the name and address, there are other ways
to identify the patients _ if it was a female patient at a certain
hospital with a particular diagnosis, that might be enough to
identify them,'' said Wendy Baldwin, the institutes' deputy
director for extramural affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Shelby's staff said that while they understood the
worries of scientists, they believe that the FOIA rules will
prevent disclosure of private or trade secret information. And, if
problems do occur after the rule is in place, ``we can address
those. We will be alert to those.''
</P>
<P>
   In most areas of science, the way to test the mettle of a study
is not to examine data, but to do another study, said Carol
Scheman, vice president for governmental affairs at the University
of Pennsylvania, but for some kinds of studies, she said, ``Sen.
Shelby is right. There are real issues of how to share data.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the pollution studies by Harvard's School of
Public health, thousands of subjects were followed for more than
two decades. That kind of work is unlikely to be copied. So, some
other method must be used to review the data behind the scientists'
final conclusions, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry is not uniformly in favor of the new rule.
Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for example, fear that
the rule will jeopardize university-industry agreements. If a
scientist's data can be fetched through FOIA, so can information
they have shared with the scientist. This means, potentially, that
competitors could learn much about the progress of their commercial
work through the new rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington watchdog group OMB Watch also points out that the
rule is aimed at nonprofit groups while leaving the corporations
who work with government funds untouched. The amendment applies to
hospitals and other nonprofit groups that get grants from the
government, but excludes groups that get contracts from the
government. ``Thus, it applies to a YMCA that receives a federal
grant, but not to Boeing that is doing a range of research through
contracts,'' Gary Bass, a spokesman for the group, said in a July
15 statement.
</P>
<P>
   But other business and advocacy groups are enthusiastic. Those
on the record in favor of the Shelby amendment include the Gun
Owners of America, which has complained about research that shows
guns in the home are several times more likely to kill family
members by accident than intruders on purpose. In Washington,
several dedicated anti-regulatory groups have lined up in favor of
the Shelby rule, including the Competitive Enterprise Institute and
the Citizens for a Sound Economy.
</P>
<P>
   In its Web site, the Chamber of Commerce notes that huge masses
of data can be fetched from scientists _ data to challenge EPA
regulations on clean air and water, data supporting the global
warming agreement called the Kyoto Protocol. ``This list is
virtually limitless and can be extended into areas other than
health and safety,'' it says.

 The following article is based on reporting by Kevin Sack, Francis
X. Clines, John Kifner and David Barstow and was written by Sack.  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After bludgeoning his wife and two children to death
with a hammer, and just eight hours before slaughtering nine people
in the brokerage houses where he traded, Mark O. Barton typed a
chilling confession on his computer and warned that he planned to
live just long enough to kill ``the people that greedily sought my
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which Barton apparently wrote near sunrise Thursday
and then left in the Stockbridge, Ga., apartment where he had
killed his family, suggested that he was tortured by his
estrangement from his wife, by his losses in the stock market and
by unexplained fears that he said had been ``transferred from my
father to me and from me to my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in Henry County, Ga., which includes the Atlanta suburb
of Stockbridge, released the letter Friday as the authorities
searched for clues to the motive behind Thursday's killing spree,
the deadliest in the state's history.
</P>
<P>
   Because Barton, 44, shot and killed himself in his van as he was
apprehended by police Thursday night, law enforcement officials
said they were unlikely to ever know exactly what caused him to
snap.
</P>
<P>
   But the often rambling letter, printed neatly on Barton's
letterhead and signed robustly in large script, offered a
remarkable glimpse into the twisted thinking of a man who seems to
have carefully calculated his three-day rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, along with recollections from people who knew
Barton, suggests that the rage that played out on a hot afternoon
in a glitzy suburb here had its roots in the earliest years of his
life. And perhaps, authorities say, he had expressed the rage
before.
</P>
<P>
   He was the only suspect in the 1993 bludgeoning deaths of his
first wife and her mother. The next year, he was under
investigation for possible molestation of his then 3-year-old
daughter. As a course of that investigation, a clinical
psychiatrist evaluated him as someone who was ``certainly capable
of homicidal thought and homicidal action.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton's mother, Gladys Barton, who lives in South Carolina,
released a statement Friday afternoon saying that she was deeply
saddened by the shootings, but that she loved her son. ``I wish
there was some way to explain why this tragedy occurred or some way
it could have been prevented,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, a chemist and securities day trader, wrote in his letter
that he killed his current wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday night and
his two children, 11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Mychelle, on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was little pain,'' he explained, in the letter, which
police said was left on a living room coffee table. ``All of them
were dead in less than five minutes. I hit them with a hammer in
their sleep and then put them face-down in the bathtub to make sure
they did not wake up in pain, to make sure they were dead. I'm so
sorry. I wish I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton went on: ``Words cannot tell the agony. Why did I? I have
been dying since October. Wake up at night so afraid, so terrified
that I couldn't be that afraid while awake. It has taken its toll.
I have come to hate this life and this system of things. I have
come to have no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Jim Simmons of the Henry County police said that Leigh Ann
Barton moved out of the couple's rented house in Morrow, Ga., in
October, and moved into the two-bedroom apartment in nearby
Stockbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, he said, Barton and his two children from his
first marriage, showed up at the apartment, needing a place to
live. Leigh Ann Barton took them in.
</P>
<P>
   Barton wrote that he killed his wife because ``she was one of
the main reasons for my demise,'' but then added that he regretted
killing her. ``She really couldn't help it and I love her so much
anyway.'' He said he then killed his children to exchange ``five
minutes of pain for a lifetime of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton also left handwritten notes on top of each child and his
wife, said Chief Jimmy W. Mercer of the Henry County police. Each
note paid brief tribute to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The children had been placed in their beds and covered. A
stuffed teddy bear was left on top of Mychelle's body and a Game
Boy computer on Matthew's. Ms. Barton's body was found in a bedroom
closet, placed behind boxes and under clothes, presumably so that
it would not be discovered by the children, Mercer said. He said
the suspected murder weapon, a hammer, also was found.
</P>
<P>
   Barton noted in his letter that investigators might notice
similarities between the deaths of his family members and those of
his previous wife, Debra Spivey Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise
Powell Spivey, 59, both of whom were found in a camping trailer,
bludgeoned with a sharp, heavy blade. But he denied killing them.
``There's no reason for me to lie now,'' he wrote. ``It just seemed
like a quiet way to kill and a relatively painless way to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Alabama slayings at a lakeside campground near
Cedar Bluff, Barton's dark, troubled side was hardly unknown to the
authorities. And several months later, in February of 1994, Georgia
child welfare officials and the Douglas County, Ga., district
attorney's office began an investigation after Barton's daughter,
then 3, told a day care worker that he had molested her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were extremely concerned because of the context, that he
was the prime suspect in a murder case,'' said David McDade, the
district attorney, who said the reports he read ``make me shudder
to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, nothing could be done to challenge Barton's custody
because the child was too young to testify, McDade said. But during
the investigation, Barton was evaluated by a clinical psychologist
who, McDade said, found he ``certainly was capable of homicidal
thought and homicidal action.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion fell on Barton in the Alabama case, investigators
said, because he had taken out a $600,000 life insurance policy on
his wife four days before her death, because they were known to be
having marital problems, and because he was already having an
affair with the woman who would become his second wife, Leigh Ann
Vandiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the number one suspect all the way through and still
is,'' said Richard Igou, the district attorney in Cedar Bluff at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found traces of what they thought might be blood
in Barton's car, but before they could conduct further tests, the
chemist told them he had spilled a soft drink on the area, ruining
any potential evidence. He gave what they felt were ``rehearsed''
answers to questions and refused to take a polygraph test,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason he was not charged was they could not place him
inside the campground,'' said Paul Dale, then a reserve captain in
the Cherokee County, Ala., sheriff's department. Dale, who was one
of the first officers on the scene, said there were no fingerprints
or witnesses. `'When I heard the name, and heard the way the two
kids and the second wife died, it didn't come as a real surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Investor's Life Insurance of Nebraska, which issued the policy,
settled Barton's claim for $450,000, with $150,000 going to a trust
fund for the children, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Barton had been carrying on an affair with Ms. Vandiver, a
co-worker at a chemical company, Lintech International, where he
had been a salesman and she a customer services assistant, the
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   In October of 1993, a month after the slaying of his first wife,
Ms. Vandiver divorced her husband, David K. Lang. A year later,
both left their jobs at Lintech, according to Julie H. Van Brunt,
the company's administrative manager, who declined to discuss the
reasons for the resignations. They were married on May 26, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   They lived in Morrow, a middle-class suburb south of Atlanta,
where their house at 6475 Sinclair Place was notable only for the
multiple phone lines and banks of computers on which Barton did his
work, mostly at home. He dressed in casual clothes and helped out
with the local boy scouts.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent months had been troubled, apparently at least
partly because of financial problems due to Barton's losses as a
high-risk day trader. As winter came, a neighbor, Cindy A.
Northcutt, said the children confided to her that Ms. Barton had
left her husband.
</P>
<P>
   In May, she said, Barton held a yard sale. But it was not the
type that people have to get rid of old, unused junk. She said it
seemed as though Barton was trying to sell virtually every item of
furniture he possessed.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the unsolved murders of his first wife and
mother-in-law, Barton had been quietly pursued by his former
father-in-law, William Spivey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like that if those people in Alabama had done their job
that there'd be 12 people alive,'' Spivey said in an interview,
fighting to contain his outrage that it took the Atlanta shooting
spree to spark fuller scrutiny of the earlier slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's police and political leaders remained grim and
devastated Friday as they reviewed the details of Thursday's
carnage. In addition to the eight men and one woman who were
killed, 13 people were injured, some of them critically, in the two
brokerage houses where Barton sprayed fire with two handguns. Ten
people remained hospitalized Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of Allen C. Tenenbaum, 48, a synagogue president
and father of three who was killed while visiting All-Tech
Investment Group Inc., held the first funeral for a victim Friday.
Gov. Roy E. Barnes ordered that flags at the state Capitol be flown
at half-staff and Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell announced that a
citywide interfaith memorial service would be held on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Barton visited the office of his lawyer,
Joseph H. Fowler, to work on some ``routine will and estate
issues,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Barton's wife and children were found at about
3:30 p.m. that day, shortly after he had finished his shooting
spree in Atlanta's Buckhead financial and entertainment district.
They were discovered by an apartment manager who had been called by
a concerned co-worker of Ms. Barton, Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's police chief, Beverly Harvard, said that police
received their first emergency call at 2:56 p.m. from a woman
reporting that shots had been fired in the offices of Momentum
Securities Inc. at Two Securities Centre on Buckhead's bustling
Piedmont Road.
</P>
<P>
   She said Barton spent about 30 minutes at the office, where he
had been trading for several months, before pulling his weapons and
firing. ``He had made comments to the extent that it was a bad
trading day and something to the effect that it was going to get
worse,'' Ms. Harvard said. Four people were killed in that office.
</P>
<P>
   James Lee, president of the Houston-based company, said Friday
that Barton met the firm's financial requirements for trading and
had signed documents saying he understood the risks of day trading.
He did not say whether Barton had suffered significant losses.
</P>
<P>
   By 3:07 p.m., Barton had crossed Piedmont Road and entered
All-Tech's office in Building 8 of the sprawling Piedmont Center
office complex, where he had traded until April. ``He acted
normally and said he hoped he wasn't disturbing anyone's trading
day,'' said Linda Lerner, the general counsel of the Montvale,
N.J.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lerner said Barton entered the branch manager's office and
spoke to him and his secretary for several minutes before pulling
his weapons and shooting the two employees. Both were seriously
injured but survived, she said. In the ensuing shooting spree,
however, five customers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harvard said Friday that Barton fired 40 rounds from his 9
mm Glock semiautomatic handgun and his .45-caliber Colt
semiautomatic pistol. She said he purchased the Glock in 1993 from
a gun shop in Warner Robins, Ga., and had properly registered it.
</P>
<P>
   The Colt, however, was registered to a Texas man who bought the
gun in 1983, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Ms. Harvard said she did not know
how Barton had obtained the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   A third gun, a .22-caliber pistol, also was recovered by
authorities at the apartment, but the ATF spokesman said it
apparently was not involved in this week's shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Two other weapons, an H&AMP;R .22-caliber pistol that Barton
purchased from a South Carolina pawnshop in 1976 and a .25-caliber
Raven semiautomatic pistol that was purchased from a Georgia
pawnshop in 1992 by someone else, were found in the van where
Barton killed himself, the spokesman said. Police also found 200
rounds of ammunition in the van.
</P>
<P>
   After Barton escaped, police first learned of his whereabouts
when he tried to steal a woman's car at 7:40 p.m. at Town Center
Mall in Cobb County, northwest of Buckhead, according to Cobb
County police.
</P>
<P>
   By about 8 p.m., police had trailed Barton's green Aerostar
minivan to a BP service station in nearby Acworth, where he killed
himself as officers approached him with guns drawn, Ms. Harvard
said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. on Friday confirmed
the existence of several significant software security flaws that
could enable intruders to gain access to the computers of millions
of customers and to damage their data via e-mail or through
commands send by a malicious Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Certain Hewlett-Packard computers are also known to be
vulnerable, but a spokesman for the company said Friday that the
company would not confirm the security vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The vulnerabilities, which affect computers running Microsoft's
Windows operating system and Internet Explorer browser in
combination with other programs, are invisible to antivirus
programs, illustrating the risks inherent in the growing complexity
of today's personal computer software.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who are at the greatest risk are those running
programs shipped as part of Microsoft's Office 97 suite of
productivity programs _ Word 97 or Excel 97 _ and owners of certain
newer models of computers made by Compaq and Hewlett-Packard that
automatically upgrade the manufacturers' own software over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft official said the company was at work creating a fix
for the the newly discovered security holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take security issues very seriously,'' said Andrew Dixon,
group product manager for Office at Microsoft. ``Right now, we are
working on testing a solution and steps for customers to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The new flaws also raise troubling questions about Microsoft's
decision to integrate its Explorer web browser directly into the
Windows operating system. That decision is a key issue in the
company's antitrust battle with the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has passionately defended the browser integration,
asserting that it offers significant consumer benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of computer security experts who are familiar with
the newly discovered flaws said that by tightly integrating Web
browsing software with its personal computer operating system,
Microsoft has greatly complicated the challenge of ensuring that
Windows is secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A single operating system and single provider of tools
dominates the market,'' said Doug Tygar, a professor of computer
science at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes
in computer security. ``Because Microsoft is linking all these
aspects of computing, all the walls that usually prevent such
attacks aren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of flaws were posted on NTbugtraq, a computer security
mailing list, over the past two days. There is no evidence that the
flaws have been exploited, according to the manufacturers involved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The flaws involve two separate interactions of programs with the
Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   The first involves a vulnerability in one version of a ``dynamic
link library,'' or DLL file that is part of Microsoft's Office 97
suite. The flaw is believed not to exist in the newly released
version, Office 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The office software component, known as JET version 3.5, creates
a security vulnerability because Microsoft has configured its
Internet Explorer program to ``trust'' Office programs, including
Word, Excel and Powerpoint. These programs can create documents
that are themselves powerful programs and that can act as a Trojan
Horse, carrying malicious code into a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Jet flaw was first reported by Juan Carlos G. Cuartango, a
programmer who has previously discovered several security holes in
two browsers _ Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape
Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Although the flawed version of Jet was replaced with a newer
version in the last boxes of Office 97 shipped, the original still
resides on the hard drives of millions of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The new flaw does not involve the small programs call ``macros''
that have caused Microsoft security headaches in the past. Rather
Jet sends queries to various data bases when the Office programs
request data. The queries can be used to trigger low-level
operating system commands _ including commands that erase files or
entire hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the extensive integration between Office applications
and Windows, such a query can be sent on behalf of a cell in a
spreadsheet, a field in a word document or other interactive
portions of an Office application.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the new flaw especially serious is that anti-virus
software does not monitor such queries and therefore would not be
effective against an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Dixon said Friday that the company was considering
giving users a new alert mechanism that would warn them about data
base queries before they were executed.
</P>
<P>
   The second security flaw has to do with the way software shipped
with computers from Compaq and Hewlett-Packard _ and possibly other
manufacturers _ is designed to interact with the Internet Explorer
Web browser. The manufacturers' software, designed to work with the
security controls in Internet Explorer 4.0, would enable an
intruder to execute arbitrary commands on a computer remotely.
</P>
<P>
   The Compaq security flaw appears particularly serious since it
can be spread to other brands of computers. Compaq's Presario
computers, which are consumer models, are shipped with a tiny Java
program, known as an applet, that has been ``digitally signed'' a
term that means it has been authenticated by Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   This applet is designed to enable Compaq to update programs on a
computer over the Internet or other computer networks. But it also
has the power to execute programs _ and can be directed to do so by
a Web page. The applet can also be sent to other computers via
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   While the existence of this program was posted to a European
security mailing list a year ago, a recent bug that exacerbates the
problem was discovered by Richard Smith, the president of Pharlap
Software, in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the problem, Microsoft's integrated Web browser will
run any program digitally signed by Compaq, in some cases without
warning the user.
</P>
<P>
   While the vulnerable program will run without any warnings only
on certain Compaq Presarios in their default configurations, it can
also be sent to and temporarily stored on any computer running
Windows 95, 98 or NT, according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the browser will pop open a box saying that the
browser wants to run a program digitally signed by Compaq Corp. If
the user responds by allowing the program to run, it will execute
commands on the computer.

SPORTS COLUMN: NEW THEME ON JETS OPENING DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In suffocating humidity and sweltering heat, the New York Jets
opened training camp Friday. Lawrence Taylor, the former Giant and
Bill Parcells' embodiment of championships past, was on hand with
support and an assessment: ``This team looks damn good,'' Taylor
said. ``He always says he got nothing, but it looks good.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the day for the new Jets' season is the here and
now. The coaching staff sported T-shirts that carried the message:
``Starting Over.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a ring of truth to the message. The Jets are starting
fresh despite enjoying their best season in 30 years in 1998. They
won the AF C East and lost to Denver in the conference championship
game. But Parcells wants to forget those accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 30 years the Jets begin a season with
tremendous expectations, not simply to make the playoffs but to
reach the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the first time that Leon Hess will not be on hand
for a new season. The Jets owner died last May, ending 36 years of
ownership. The players will not wear commemorative patches on their
jerseys or helmets. That was not the Hess' style. The Jets' owner
was low key and subtle, steadfastly refusing to call undue
attention to himself.
</P>
<P>
   That made Day One of Jets camp incongruous, perhaps even
troubling for anyone looking for a hint of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells spent the first part of day responding to questions
about a barroom brawl involving Jumbo Elliott, 34; Jason Fabini, 24
and former Jet Matt O'Dwyer, 26.
</P>
<P>
   The three were arrested on July 9 at a Long Beach, N.Y.,
bar-restaurant where, according to the police, Elliott urinated in
a wash basin in the women's restroom. A woman who said she
confronted Elliott, told the police that the 6 foot 7 inch, 300
pound Elliott punched her in the stomach. According to the police,
Elliott then hit a male patron when he returned from the restroom.
Supposedly 30 officers were needed to subdue the three players.
Three police officers and two others who claim they were injured
are suing them.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, in his first public comment about the arrest, Friday
sounded supportive without offering support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to him, I always talk to players any number of
times about incidents like this,'' he said. ``I read stories to the
team so that they learn about the pit falls. You can't be
judgmental until all the facts in; you can't be judgmental about
hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells added that he knew ``some things about this case that
aren't true about this case. Given the circumstances that have
evolved I think he wished he didn't go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what effect he thought the incident would have on the
team, Parcells said, ``I have to be concerned about it, but I don't
expect it to be a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what to expect? Who expected this? A grimy, blue-light
type controversy on a team whose ownership status _ after three
decades of stability _ is up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of a season, events unfold that mobilize a
team, bring a team together. In the past, the Jets never needed a
rallying point _ their history of mediocrity was impetus enough.
Bryan Cox, the outspoken linebacker, said Elliott and Fabini are
the early lightening rods. ``We're all for each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we going to do: Go up to him and say, `Bad, bad boy!'
We've go out and get ready for this up coming season. Guilty or not
guilty, that's not important,'' Cox said. ``It's an `Us against the
world' mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades under the benevolent Hess, the Jets were perceived
as the People's team. Now, perhaps as a result of the episode, the
new Jets' motto is `Us Against The People.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Things could be worst: Dolphins wide receiver Tony Martin faces
a federal trial Aug. 2 on charges of laundering money for a drug
dealer. If found guilty, he could be sentenced to as much as 20
years in prison. In West Virginia, 49ers backup quarterback Jim
Druckenmiller was found not guilty of a charge that he raped a
Virginia Tech student last March.
</P>
<P>
   Now Elliott and Fabini. Leon Hess would not be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is feeling bad,'' Elliott said. ``If you read the
papers you think I was the Son of Sam or something. The only thing
I'll say is that it was an unfortunate deal,'' Elliot said. I wish
we never went anywhere that night.''
</P>
<P>
   But they did go out and perhaps set the tone: for a season, for
a new era and for a franchise trying start over.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted Friday to cut taxes by $792
billion over the next 10 years, moving the Republican-controlled
Congress toward a politically charged showdown with President
Clinton over how the nation can best use trillions of dollars in
projected federal budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 57-43. Four Democrats joined 53 Republicans in
support of the bill, while two Republicans and 41 Democrats voted
against it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would cut personal income taxes by reducing the lowest
tax rate to 14 percent from 15 percent starting in 2001. It would
give a tax break to many married couples, expand the Individual
Retirement Account program, create a deduction for some health
insurance costs and reduce the inheritance tax on large estates.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bill's provisions, which also include breaks for
business and special-interest groups, would be phased in gradually
as the expected surpluses grow, and some would not be fully
effective until 2009. Of the total of $792 billion in tax
reductions over 10 years, only $4.1 billion would take effect next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William V. Roth, R-Del., who was the main author of the
measure, said the Senate had taken ``a giant step forward to give
the American people a tax break.''
</P>
<P>
   The House passed a tax cut last week that is the same size as
the Senate's but has different provisions. Leaders of the
Republican majority from both houses met Friday even before the
Senate bill had been passed to begin reconciling the two versions.
They hope to complete their work next week before Congress leaves
for its summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the momentum
within the party was toward adopting the centerpiece of the House
bill, a 10 percent reduction in all income tax rates. Such a move
would further harden objections to the tax bill among Democrats,
who say the House approach favors the wealthy even more
disproportionately than the Senate version.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has promised to veto the Republican tax bill in whatever
form it emerges from Congress. Along with most Democrats in
Congress and Vice President Al Gore, who laid out his own tax
proposal Friday, Clinton is pushing for a tax cut of no more than
$300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Republican approach would risk a return of big
budget deficits, forgo an opportunity for further reductions in the
national debt and leave too little of the anticipated surplus to
deal with Medicare, education, health care, the military and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``By pushing through a tax plan that is too big and too bloated,
the majority party has pushed aside our vital national
priorities,'' Clinton said in a statement released by the White
House as he returned to Washington from Bosnia. ``I will not sign a
tax plan that shortchanges our seniors and our young people. I will
not sign a plan that signs away our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the House and Senate bills amount to the opening
gambit by Republicans in what is likely to be a high-stakes
negotiation between the White House and the congressional
leadership this fall over taxes, spending, Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   To a considerable degree, any negotiations will be driven by
complex calculations within both parties about how a deal would
affect elections next year. With both the presidency and control of
the House up for grabs, some members of both parties would prefer
drawing lines in the sand and fighting out their differences on the
campaign trail. Others see a compromise as the best way of showing
that their party can be trusted to govern.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight will also reflect fundamentally different
ideological approaches to government and taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a large tax cut, Republicans said, there is enough
money to deal with pressing problems like Medicare. And they said
returning as much of the government's excess revenues to the
taxpayers is the best way of insuring the economy's long-term
health, and the best defense against further growth in the size and
influence of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put a surplus on the table in this town, it gets
spent,'' Speaker Dennis Hastert said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said it is imprudent to lock in a big tax cut now when
there is no assurance that the anticipated surpluses will
materialize. They said the last big tax cut, in 1981, had sent the
nation into a spiral of rising deficits and debt from which it had
only just emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another riverboat gamble with the American economy,''
said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   If the surpluses do materialize, Democrats said, they should be
divided among a variety of needs, including modest tax cuts for
low- and middle-income families, additional spending on vital
programs, reducing the national debt and shoring up the Medicare
system of health insurance for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   There is one point on which the two parties generally agree:
that the portion of the projected surplus generated by Social
Security payroll taxes _ about $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years
out of a total surplus of $2.9 trillion _ should go only to shoring
up Social Security's financial condition or revamping the
retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they are fighting only over the remaining $1
trillion or so. After taking into account technical calculations
about the tax cut's effect on interest payments on the national
debt, the $792 billion Republican plan would use up nearly all of
the surplus.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the final hours of debate Friday, the Senate rejected or did
not take up scores of amendments intended to score political points
or secure a change that would benefit an interest group. But it
adopted a number of amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was an expansion of the provisions intended to
eliminate the so-called marriage penalty, which leaves many
two-income couples paying more in taxes than they would if single.
The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas,
would add to the tax package an increase in the standard deduction
for couples filing jointly.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also accepted an amendment offered by Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., and Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., to reduce
capital gains taxes. The measure would allow taxpayers to exempt
their first $1,000 in capital gains each year from capital gains
taxes, starting in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and his
counterpart in the House, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee, are scheduled to meet Sunday to begin
negotiating in earnest over how to mesh their bills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reconciling different approaches to income taxes,
the marriage penalty, reductions in the inheritance tax and other
components of their packages, they will have to pick and choose
among a variety of much smaller provisions that are important to
politically influential constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   They will also have to steer their way around a number of
political dilemmas. Moderate Republicans in the House have
threatened to block the tax package if the final version does not
include a provision making the tax cuts dependent on keeping
interest payments on the national debt under control, a contingency
not included in the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   They could also be under pressure to delay those tax cuts that
take effect next year. Faced with an intense squeeze on spending
bills, the House is moving toward dipping into next year's budget
surplus to pay for government operations, meaning that money would
not be available for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats who voted for the Senate tax cut were Torricelli;
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, and John Breaux and Mary Landrieu, both of
Louisiana. The Republicans who voted against it were Arlen Specter
of Pennsylvania and George Voinovich of Ohio.

   NASD Board Votes For Day-Trading Screens &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers board approved a
rule last week that would require day-trading firms to screen
customers to determine if they are suited to the lightning-fast
trading style.
</P>
<P>
   The firms, which train investors and charge them for on-site use
of their trading systems, would have to decide if day trading makes
sense for a customer, based on his or her financial situation,
previous investing or trading experience and investment objectives,
NASD officials said. The rule must be approved by the Securities
and Exchange Commission. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Investing by a Different Book &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You may know where your mutual fund stands on the fundamentals.
But how does it stand with, say, the fundamentalists?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, log onto Crosswalk.com, a publicly traded Internet
portal company (ticker: AMEN) described by its chief executive,
William M. Parker, as ``a leading host and advocate for the online
Christian community.''
</P>
<P>
   The portal's investing site offers a service called ``the
Investigator'' that will evaluate your fund's holdings according to
``values based'' criteria that have little to do with price-to-book
multiples.
</P>
<P>
   The Investigator, which costs $29.95 a year, rates each security
held by a fund based on the corporate policies of its issuer. Funds
are then graded on a scale according to what percentage of their
holdings pass muster.
</P>
<P>
   Companies can fail the screens for various reasons. The
Investigator says that Johnson &AMP; Johnson makes contributions to
Planned Parenthood, that Marriott International shows adult movies
in hotel rooms, that Time Warner markets ``anti-family''
entertainment and that Bell Atlantic has a unit that offers
benefits to same-sex partners of employees.
</P>
<P>
   So how do funds fare in an environment where market leaders like
Microsoft (described as aggressively promoting ``nonmarriage life
styles'') are deemed unacceptable?
</P>
<P>
   Index funds, it seems, haven't a prayer, because of the wide
range of stocks they hold. The $93 billion Vanguard 500 Index,
failed miserably, with an enormous 41 percent of its holdings not
clearing the values-based screens. But its actively managed rival,
the $100 billion Fidelity Magellan fund, didn't do much better,
with 36 percent of its holdings failing.
</P>
<P>
   But those whose funds fail the test may be able to relax. The
Investigator selects alternative funds with similar one-, three-
and five-year returns, but with lower levels of what it calls
``offensive holdings.''
</P>
<P>
   For Magellan, those funds include Fidelity 50 and Janus
Enterprise. At least one alternative to the Index 500 may leave you
scratching your head: the Smith Breeden U.S. Equity Market Plus.
The fund uses futures to track the index, but holds no stock and is
thus deemed ``pure.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Richard Teitelbaum &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Potentially Costly Lawsuit &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Louis Navellier, the fund manager, to press a
lawsuit against the independent directors who tried to oust him
from the Navellier Aggressive Small Cap Equity fund in 1997 might
prove expensive _ for either the fund's shareholders or Navellier
himself.
</P>
<P>
   A federal district court jury in San Francisco ruled on July 21
in favor of the directors and against claims by Navellier that they
had wasted the fund's money and breached their fiduciary duty in
their fight to remove him as the fund's investment adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The directors accused Navellier of failing to provide
appropriate information about the fund and replaced him with MFS
Investment Management; Navellier, who contended that the directors
were acting in self-interest, waged a successful proxy fight to win
back management of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   But Navellier then lost the lawsuit against two of the
directors, who are expected to seek reimbursement of legal costs
that could total several million dollars, said the lawyer for one
of them, Paul Finigan. The fight over legal fees, first reported on
Ignites.com, a Web site, could put a dent in the fund's net asset
value.
</P>
<P>
   Total assets were just $37.5 million as of June 30, according to
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Navellier's lawyer, Samuel Kornhauser, said that an appeal was
planned and that the directors had no right to indemnification by
the fund. However, of Navellier, he said, ``There isn't any legal
obligation, but I think his position is, if there was any recovery,
he would end up paying for it.'' &QL;

NO RED CARPET IN FALKLANDS FOR ARGENTINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Before the ink was even dry, President
Carlos Saul Menem called his recent agreement with Britain to allow
Argentine tourists to visit the Falkland Islands for the first time
since the 1982 Falkland war ``the crown jewel'' of his 10 years in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Overjoyed by his self-proclaimed diplomatic victory, Menem said
his daughter, Zulema, would be on the first commercial flight
between Argentina and the Falklands in October. He said he would
soon follow, hinting that he might even make it to the South
Atlantic archipelago before his term ends in December as a
victorious swan song.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said he
wanted to go. After sending Christmas cards to the islanders in
recent years as part of his ``charm offensive,'' Di Tella said he
had new friends to visit.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks after the initial hoopla, the agreement has not
turned out to be everything Menem had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   His handpicked vice president, Carlos Ruckauf, has sharply
criticized the pact for obliging visiting Argentines to carry
passports _ an explicit recognition that the archipelago is foreign
soil and not Argentine as stated in the constitution. And the first
Argentine journalists reporting from the islands have written that
many of the 2,400 residents, as a front-page headline in Clarin,
the capital's largest daily newspaper, put it, ``fear a flood of
Argentines.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been several small but nasty demonstrations against
the agreement, including one in which a few hundred islanders
burned an Argentine flag and threw stones at the house of a local
official who supported the negotiations that produced the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the disturbances, the British governor on the islands
gave an interview to Clarin warning high-placed Argentines to stay
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere in the islands is such that it would be asking
for problems and hostility toward the visitors,'' the governor,
Donald Lamont, said. ``I don't want to sound negative, but there
are people with very strong opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilor Mike Summers, who was one of two Falkland
representatives who helped negotiate the agreement, told an
Argentine radio station that Di Tella and Miss Menem ought to
postpone their visits because ``there are still angry feelings in
the Falklands toward the Argentines.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Argentine officials have let it be known that the
president and Di Tella would probably not be setting foot in the
Falklands anytime soon, even if Miss Menem continues to insist she
is going.
</P>
<P>
   Menem told reporters he may send Tourism Secretary Francisco
Mayorga in place of Di Tella. Mayorga's visit would be a message
that the islanders stand to gain monetarily from better relations
with Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   As some of the most vocal islanders see it, the agreement is a
Trojan Horse that will lead to an eventual Argentine conquest. The
agreement, which does not settle the sovereignty issue, opens
commercial air travel between Argentina and the islands and pledges
Argentine-British cooperation in clearing land mines left behind
from the 1982 war.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published last week in The Penguin News, a weekly paper
distributed in Port Stanley, reported that 56 percent of the
islanders oppose the commercial air link that will bring Argentines
to the Falklands.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina has claimed the islands ever since a British force
overwhelmed a small Argentine constabulary there in the 1830s.

Roger Enrico's vision of the future: ``the Power Aisle,'' a large
space stocked with mostly Pepsi soft drinks and Frito-Lay snack
food. Pepsi's hope is that a shopper looking for a two-liter bottle
of Mountain Dew will grab a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos as well. The
goal, of course, is to pump up Pepsi's sales and profits by taking
advantage of some synergies unavailable to its arch-rival, Coke,
and thereby boost its lagging share price. (David Jennings/New York

U.S. TO PAY $4.5 MILLION TO COMPENSATE VICTIMS OF CHINESE EMBASSY
BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to correct name of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
2nd graf.)  (th) 
 By SETH FAISON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The United States and China agreed here Friday that
Washington will pay $4.5 million to compensate the victims of
NATO's May 7 bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement removes one of the biggest obstacles to improved
relations between Washington and Beijing. Several sensitive issues
_ Taiwan and trade, above all _ remain on the table as the two
countries prepare for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
in New Zealand in September. President Clinton and China's
president, Jiang Zemin, are scheduled to attend that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   David Andrews, a legal adviser to the State Department who led
the American side in the negotiations, said Friday's agreement
reflected what he called ``the critical importance of the
U.S.-China relationship.'' Andrews said the money would be paid as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement does not resolve questions about compensation for
property damage to the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade or to the U.S.
Embassy and consulates in China in days of violent protest
following the bombing. Talks on property damage will begin in late
August, Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said the Chinese government would decide how the
compensation will be divided among the families of the three people
who were killed and 27 who were wounded. China will also distribute
the money.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said in Washington that the agreement was an ``important step in
putting this issue behind us and mending the relationship with
Beijing _ obviously it's very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombing was viewed by Chinese leaders and citizens alke as
a grave affront to national dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled meetings on human rights, security issues and China's
effort to join the World Trade Organization were all postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Following the bombing, China's leaders adopted a stern line in
all contacts with the United States. They demanded a full apology,
a detailed accounting on how the bombing occurred and punishment
for those responsible as conditions to restoring normal ties.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Beijing's official position is that Washington's
explanation _ that the bombing was caused by faulty planning and
poor intelligence _ is insufficient. But American officials said
that in recent weeks they have detected efforts by Chinese
officials to find a way past their earlier, more confrontational
demands.
</P>
<P>
   China's state media gave wide coverage to phone calls that
President Clinton made to Jiang. The two presidents spoke when
teams from the two nations played each other in the Women's World
Cup Final on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   They conferred again last week after Taiwan's president, Lee
Teng-hui, infuriated Beijing with remarks widely interpreted as
nudging Taiwan closer to formal independence _ something China has
vowed to block with military force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Minor progress was made in the compensation talks, Andrews said.
Previously, China was unwilling to discuss compensation for damage
to the U.S. Embassy and consulates in China, arguing that it was
caused by student demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrews said Friday that Yin Yubiao, the Chinese Foreign
Ministry's director-general for treaties and law, agreed to hold
simultaneous discussions about compensation for damage to each
side's property.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews stressed Friday that the $4.5 million compensation
payment is voluntary and does not represent an admission of
liability on the part of the United States. Washington has insisted
that the bombing was unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``This payment will not create any precedents,'' Andrews said,
apparently to quell concern about possible claims against the
United States that might arise from future military action.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most pressing issue in the coming months will be
China's desire to enter the World Trade Organization. With limited
time in a complex schedule of hurdles that have to be crossed to
win U.S. support for China's entry to the organization, American
officials said the talks would have to restart before the September
summit between Clinton and Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   So far, China has been unwilling to resume negotiations. The
compensation talks had been considered the primary obstacle, but
American officials say they will not know until they actually sit
down again at a negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the official New China News Agency reiterated China's
position that the bombing was indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese side stressed that the U.S. bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia caused serious personnel casualties and
property losses and grossly violated the international law and the
norms governing the international relations,'' the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. side must bear all the responsibilities for this and
make immediate, adequate and effective compensations for all the
losses occurred to the Chinese side.''

 &HT;    Atlanta searches for answers
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark O. Barton's notes of explanation, released Friday
by police, did little to answer the question this city asked itself
through the day as it tallied 13 dead and 13 wounded in Thursday's
shootings: How could one man's torment lead so quickly to so much
pain for so many?
</P>
<P>
   What inner demons would lead a man to bludgeon his wife and two
children in their suburban apartment over a two-day period, drive
to an Atlanta financial district and kill nine people, then take
his own life five hours later cornered by police at a gas station?
</P>
<P>
   According to the note Barton left behind in his apartment, typed
on his personal stationery, he wasn't sure himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was little pain,'' he said about killing his 27-year-old
wife, Leigh Ann, and children, Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 7. ``All
of them were dead in less than five minutes. I hit them with a
hammer in their sleep and then put them face down in a bathtub to
make sure they did not wake up in pain. To make sure they were
dead. I am so sorry. I wish I didn't. Words cannot tell the agony.
Why did I?''
</P>
<P>
   The note hinted of the self-imposed suffering Barton had been
enduring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been dying since October. I wake up at night so afraid,
so terrified that I couldn't be that afraid while awake. It has
taken its toll. I have come to hate this life and this system of
things. I have come to have no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   For the loved ones of those slain Thursday, the only hope Friday
was that their grief will one day pass. For some of those keeping
watch over 11 shooting victims at four area hospitals, hope was all
they had.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday night, five victims remained in critical condition.
One person was listed as serious, another as stable, and another in
fair condition. Two victims were satisfactory and one was in good
condition. Two were released from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators could offer no motive Friday for the bloody
rampage at the two brokerage companies, Momentum Securities and
All-Tech Investment Group.
</P>
<P>
   Neither could Barton's mother, with whom he talked by telephone
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no explanation for tragedy such as this,'' Gladys
Barton said in a statement issued at her home in Sumter, S.C. ``I
have been praying for the victims and their families. Even though I
am deeply hurt by the actions of
</P>
<P>
   my son, Mark, I loved him very much. I wish there was some way
to explain why this tragedy occurred or some way that it could have
been prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Barton's conversation Wednesday with her only child ``kind
of upset'' her and left her worried about her son's mental state,
said close friend Zelma Hutchinson. Mrs. Barton said her son was
suffering from depression.
</P>
<P>
   Although there had been widespread speculation that Barton was
despondent over large stock market losses, officials would not say
that's what caused his murderous rage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officers at Momentum Securities said Barton lost about
$105,000 during 15 days of trading that began June 9 and ended July
27. All-Tech Investment Group would not release any details of his
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Barton became a customer at Momentum Securities on May 13, when
he submitted a notarized statement in which he claimed a net worth
of $750,000. He said he was earning $85,000 a year as a chemist and
his wife was making $40,000 a year as a store manager.
</P>
<P>
   Both brokerage companies reopened Friday morning, though
employees and others returned to a surreal scene that reminded them
of the horror many had lived just hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the buildings, a line of TV satellite trucks were parked
along Piedmont Road in the upscale Buckhead section of Atlanta.
They were kept company by a cordon of police and other security
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, workers were hauling out furniture and other items
damaged in the 40-bullet fusillade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The carpet had been removed from one of the elevators,'' said
Tom Stow, a senior accountant at Hardwick &AMP; Co. at the Two
Securities Centre building. ``I understand why, but it brought it
all home for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   The carnage even shook paramedics and other officials who tended
to the wounded Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see shootings all the time, they almost seem routine,''
said Reginald McCoy, a paramedic. ``But I've never seen anything
like that ... the volume. It was utter chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rustin with American Medical Response, which sent 10
ambulances to the scene, said he entered the offices at Two
Securities Centre and found bodies scattered throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in and there were two fatalities to the left, one
critical to the right, one fatality in the hallway, two more
critical and one walking wounded,'' Rustin said.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims were still sitting in their chairs behind their
desks, unable to escape Barton's shooting spree. Others lay on the
floor in an office and a hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked like they never even had a chance to run,'' Rustin
said. ``It's not a natural reaction to stay in your office when
someone is shooting. They were still in their chairs, slumped over
their desks.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the wounded asked how their co-workers and friends
were, creating a touchy situation for paramedics who knew many were
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to be false or misleading,'' said William Teet,
a Grady paramedic. ``You have to make a judgment depending on the
situation. An anxious patient can make a trauma situation worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street in Piedmont Center, Timothy Brazie with AMR
said he stepped into the day trading room to find a man who'd been
shot in the face. He was alive and talking.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the people slain in Buckhead were men, the other a
woman. The first of them was buried Friday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people attended the funeral at Congregation Or
Veshalom for Allen Charles Tenenbaum, a 48-year-old father of three
and owner of a downtown Atlanta grocery store. He was buried
quickly in keeping with Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   Police continued Friday to try to reconstruct Barton's actions
over the last frantic hours of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the green Ford Aerostar minivan in which Barton killed
himself, police found two handguns _ a .45-caliber and a 9mm, both
used in the shootings. Barton used the .45-caliber weapon to shoot
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Police also found a duffel bag with 200 rounds ammunition, two
more handguns and two pairs of handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Barton had purchased the 9mm handgun in November 1993 at a gun
shop in Warner Robins, in Middle Georgia. The .45-caliber gun was
registered to a resident of Richardson, Texas, who has not been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Thursday's slayings, police also refocused on the
bludgeoning deaths of Barton's first wife and her mother six years
ago in northeastern Alabama. Barton, who had taken out a $600,000
life insurance policy on his wife two months earlier, had been
considered a prime suspect but never was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In the note police found Thursday, Barton denied any involvement
in the 1993 murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be similarities between these deaths and the death
of my first wife, Debra Spivey,'' Barton wrote. ``However, I deny
killing her and her mother. There's no reason for me to lie now.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton settled with the insurance company for $450,000,
according to federal court records. Of that, $150,000 was to be
held by Barton for his children.
</P>
<P>
   After the rest was divided among Barton's lawyers and his
children's temporary guardian, Barton was left with about $194,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many who knew Barton, his children and his second wife described
them as a normal family, involved in Boy Scouts and Brownies. But
the marriage was floundering; Barton and his wife had separated and
filed for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, it's not known when, Barton made other plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan to live very much longer, just long enough to
kill as many of the people that greedily sought my destruction,''
Barton said in his note. ``You should kill me if you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the survivors are left to wonder and express their
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``So quick. So fast,'' Atlanta police Chief Beverly Harvard said
Friday. ``So many people all at one time. It becomes even more
devastating because of that. Yesterday this time there were nine
people that were alive and breathing and going about their
business. Today, less than 24 hours later, they're gone _ just like
that. All at the hands of one person, by a deliberate act of one
person.''

of Mountain Dew will grab a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos as well. The
goal, of course, is to pump up Pepsi's sales and profits by taking
advantage of some synergies unavailable to its arch-rival, Coke,
and thereby boost its lagging share price. (David Jennings/New York

MISSISSIPPI POLITICIANS TRY TO IGNORE EMBATTLED GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA, Miss. _ As tradition dictates in Mississippi
politics, Eddie Briggs, a Republican candidate for governor in next
Tuesday's primary, took the podium for his allotted time this week
at the 110th Neshoba County Fair, a mandatory stop on Mississippi's
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   In front of a mostly white and mostly conservative crowd of
fairgoers who sat waving cardboard fans in the sweltering heat,
Briggs began by introducing his family. But before mentioning his
own wife, he invoked the name of the current governor's wife. ``You
know,'' Briggs said, ``Mississippi has the best first lady in this
nation in Pat Fordice.'' The crowd cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the remainder of his 10-minute speech, Briggs, the
former lieutenant governor, never uttered the name of Mrs.
Fordice's husband, Gov. Kirk Fordice, a Republican. The other
Republican candidates here, including the front-runner, Mike
Parker, a former Democratic congressman who has since switched to
the Republicans, never mentioned Fordice, either.
</P>
<P>
   That might seem odd, because when he came into office in 1991 as
Mississippi's first Republican governor since Reconstruction,
Fordice was hailed by his party as a forerunner of a new Republican
dominance in the historically Democratic South. But now, as
Fordice's second and final term nears an end, Mississippi
Republicans are working to hold on to the power they gained in the
last decade. And most believe the governor and his well-publicized
marital infidelity and rocky relationship with the state
Legislature and the press are better left relegated to the past.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Leaving behind the darker parts of this state's past is an
exercise familiar to many Mississippians, especially here in
Philadelphia, best-known for the murders of three civil rights
workers from nearby Meridian, Miss., in the summer of 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of Fordice's first acts as governor was to put this
message on signs at the state's borders: ``Welcome to Mississippi _
only positive Mississippi spoken here.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even Ronnie Musgrove, the front-running Democrat in the race and
the current lieutenant governor, did not mention Fordice directly
in his speech here.
</P>
<P>
   But among the fairgoers he was a hot topic. Jokes, gossip and
some debate about him flowed almost as freely as the lemonade and
iced tea at this weeklong event, dubbed ``Mississippi's Giant House
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not your standard state fair. During the week of the
fair, which ends on Saturday, hundreds of families live on the
fairgrounds in about 600 wooden cabins, all with running water and
electricity, grouped in neighborhoods. Most of the highly coveted
cabins have been passed down from generation to generation. The
atmosphere is more like a campground full of family reunions, with
a midway, horse racing and political speeches thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   But in an election year, the political speeches always get more
attention here. And on Thursday, when Fordice appeared for his last
speech at the fair as governor, a larger than normal crowd packed
the pavilion to see if any political fireworks would occur.
</P>
<P>
   After Fordice took the stage, he began a dry recounting of his
political achievements. He, too, preferred not to mention anything
about his personal indiscretions. He never referred to the recent
scandal that ensued when he was caught by television reporters at
the Memphis, Tenn., airport in June coming back from a vacation in
Paris with a woman who was not his wife. He then declared publicly
that he was going to divorce Mrs. Fordice and marry the other
woman, who had been his girlfriend in junior high school.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Fordice kept his composure during his speech despite
hecklers in the audience who held up signs that read: ``Paris is
lovely in the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many who follow politics here do not believe Fordice's
problems will have much impact on the state's Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mississippi was a one-party state for so long,'' said Joseph
Parker, a political science professor at the University of Southern
Mississippi in Hattiesburg, ``that voters still don't hold the
party responsible for the actions of a candidate as much they might
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Wiseman, director of the Stennis Institute of government
at Mississippi State University in Starkville, said, ``I think the
Republicans will just cut Fordice out of the herd and keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Mason-Dixon Polling and Research Inc. poll showed
Musgrove with a comfortable lead among Democrats, favored by 69
percent of those surveyed. His closest rival, Jim Roberts, won 17
percent. On the Republican side, the race was tighter, with Parker
favored by 45 percent of those polled, and Briggs backed by 32
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, published in The Northeast Daily Journal in Tupelo,
had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Although everyone expressed skepticism about the polls, Parker,
the political science professor, said there was a good chance that
no one would get a majority of the Republican vote in the primary,
thereby forcing a runoff. He also said it was likely that Musgrove
would win a majority in the Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But for Zella Bell Barrew, 87, who sat out on the porch of the
cabin her father built before she was born, the choice was clear.
She announced that she would vote Democratic, as she always has and
probably will support Musgrove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never did vote for Fordice,'' she said. ``I could tell from
day one that he was no good. But he has a sweet little wife who has
put up with more than any one woman should have to. I could just
punch him, but I can't even stand to look at him.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although Ms. Barrew could not make it to the pavilion this year
to hear the speeches, she might have been interested in Fordice's
closing words to the crowd here.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``I'm here today to begin, anyway, to close the book on
the public service chapter in my life _''
</P>
<P>
   A few people in the audience began to clap loudly at this point.
There was an awkward pause before the governor added, `` _ and
return from whence I came.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, before walking off the same stage at the Neshoba County
Fair from which John Glenn spoke in his unsuccessful presidential
campaign in 1984, Fordice paraphrased Mission Control's remark to
Glenn as he was launched into space to become the first American to
orbit Earth. In what many believe will be one of Fordice's last
speeches before leaving office, his ended by saying, ``Godspeed,
Mississippi.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. on Friday confirmed
the existence of several significant software security flaws that
could enable intruders to gain access to the computers of millions
of customers and to damage their data via e-mail or through
commands sent from a malicious Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Certain Hewlett-Packard computers are also known to be
vulnerable, but a spokesman for the company said Friday that the
company would not confirm the security vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The vulnerabilities, which affect computers running Microsoft's
Windows operating system and Internet Explorer browser in
combination with other programs, are invisible to antivirus
programs, illustrating the risks inherent in the growing complexity
of today's personal computer software.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who are at the greatest risk are those running
programs shipped as part of Microsoft's Office 97 suite of
productivity programs _ Word 97 or Excel 97 _ and owners of certain
newer models of computers made by Compaq and Hewlett-Packard that
automatically upgrade the manufacturers' own software over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft official said the company was at work creating a fix
for the the newly discovered security holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take security issues very seriously,'' said Andrew Dixon,
group product manager for Office at Microsoft. ``Right now, we are
working on testing a solution and steps for customers to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The new flaws also raise troubling questions about Microsoft's
decision to integrate its Explorer web browser directly into the
Windows operating system. That decision is a key issue in the
company's antitrust battle with the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has passionately defended the browser integration,
asserting that it offers significant consumer benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of computer security experts who are familiar with
the newly discovered flaws said that by tightly integrating Web
browsing software with its personal computer operating system,
Microsoft has greatly complicated the challenge of ensuring that
Windows is secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A single operating system and single provider of tools
dominates the market,'' said Doug Tygar, a professor of computer
science at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes
in computer security. ``Because Microsoft is linking all these
aspects of computing, all the walls that usually prevent such
attacks aren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of flaws were posted on NTbugtraq, a computer security
mailing list, over the past two days. There is no evidence that the
flaws have been exploited, according to the manufacturers involved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The flaws involve two separate interactions of programs with the
Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   The first involves a vulnerability in one version of a ``dynamic
link library,'' or DLL file that is part of Microsoft's Office 97
suite. The flaw is believed not to exist in the newly released
version, Office 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The office software component, known as JET version 3.5, creates
a security vulnerability because Microsoft has configured its
Internet Explorer program to ``trust'' Office programs, including
Word, Excel and Powerpoint. These programs can create documents
that are themselves powerful programs and that can act as a Trojan
Horse, carrying malicious code into a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Jet flaw was first reported by Juan Carlos G. Cuartango, a
programmer who has previously discovered several security holes in
two browsers _ Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape
Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Although the flawed version of Jet was replaced with a newer
version in the last boxes of Office 97 shipped, the original still
resides on the hard drives of millions of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The new flaw does not involve the small programs call ``macros''
that have caused Microsoft security headaches in the past. Rather
Jet sends queries to various data bases when the Office programs
request data. The queries can be used to trigger low-level
operating system commands _ including commands that erase files or
entire hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the extensive integration between Office applications
and Windows, such a query can be sent on behalf of a cell in a
spreadsheet, a field in a word document or other interactive
portions of an Office application.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the new flaw especially serious is that anti-virus
software does not monitor such queries and therefore would not be
effective against an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Dixon said Friday that the company was considering
giving users a new alert mechanism that would warn them about data
base queries before they were executed.
</P>
<P>
   The second security flaw has to do with the way software shipped
with computers from Compaq and Hewlett-Packard _ and possibly other
manufacturers _ is designed to interact with the Internet Explorer
Web browser. The manufacturers' software, designed to work with the
security controls in Internet Explorer 4.0, would enable an
intruder to execute arbitrary commands on a computer remotely.
</P>
<P>
   The Compaq security flaw appears particularly serious since it
can be spread to other brands of computers. Compaq's Presario
computers, which are consumer models, are shipped with a tiny Java
program, known as an applet, that has been ``digitally signed'' a
term that means it has been authenticated by Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   This applet is designed to enable Compaq to update programs on a
computer over the Internet or other computer networks. But it also
has the power to execute programs _ and can be directed to do so by
a Web page. The applet can also be sent to other computers via
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   While the existence of this program was posted to a European
security mailing list a year ago, a recent bug that exacerbates the
problem was discovered by Richard Smith, the president of Pharlap
Software, in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the problem, Microsoft's integrated Web browser will
run any program digitally signed by Compaq, in some cases without
warning the user.
</P>
<P>
   While the vulnerable program will run without any warnings only
on certain Compaq Presarios in their default configurations, it can
also be sent to and temporarily stored on any computer running
Windows 95, 98 or NT, according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the browser will pop open a box saying that the
browser wants to run a program digitally signed by Compaq Corp. If
the user responds by allowing the program to run, it will execute
commands on the computer.

 MILK INDUSTRY TRIES DIFFERENT MARKETING APPROACHES  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
(begin ital)A wholesome, all-American family sits down to dinner.
But look _ happy, smiling Mom has yellow, rotting teeth! Dad's
smile is riddled with cavernous gaps.
<P>
   A shot of the fridge reveals massive bottles of bright blue
soda, the only foodstuff it contains. Just one family member, a
sweet-faced boy, displays a lustrous smile. But before he takes a
sip of soda, he pulls a set of dentures from his mouth and sets
them on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Got milk?(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. What you've got instead is a commercial that
will never see the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   The spot was one of several ad concepts developed earlier this
year by Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, the award-winning San
Francisco ad agency that has been churning out ``Got Milk?'' ads
for six years.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Wholesome Family'' spot represented a significant
departure from the now-familiar ``Got Milk?'' formula, in which a
man stuffs his mouth full of sweets and then discovers that he is
out of milk. Instead, it conveys a much more serious _ and bold _
message: that soda pop, Americans' favorite beverage, is bad for
peoples' health.
</P>
<P>
   Focus group participants found the script for ``Wholesome
Family'' both entertaining and convincing. Moreover, the nutrition
message seemed particularly potent because research has shown that
most consumers who choose to increase their milk consumption do so
for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Nevertheless, the ``Wholesome Family'' script currently
resides in Goodby, Silverstein's circular file, along with rejects
on topics like mackerel smoothies and lactose-intolerant weight
lifters. The story of how ``Wholesome Family'' died illustrates the
hurdles milk marketers face as they attempt to take on the
well-financed soft drink industry.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Effective milk advertising is important because the dairy
industry is in a bind. Per-capita milk consumption in the United
States has been dropping for at least 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to research by Strategic Information Group, milk
accounted for just 13.9 percent of nonalcoholic packaged beverages
consumed in the United States in 1996, down from 16.8 percent in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   Soft drinks, meanwhile, jumped from 21.7 percent to 29.6 percent
in 1996, the most recent year for which data were available.
</P>
<P>
   The trend was similar in California until the drop-off
stabilized in 1994, one year after the launch of the ``Got Milk?''
advertising campaign here. Sales data indicate, however, that milk
drinking is beginning to slip again.
</P>
<P>
   Why are people drinking less milk? In a Goodby, Silverstein poll
conducted last November, the No. 1 reason cited was ``a preference
for other beverages.'' (Rising prices, something marketers have no
control over, was second.)
</P>
<P>
   Sodamakers appear to be the biggest beneficiaries, although
bottled water and other beverages are believed to be taking some of
milk's market share.
</P>
<P>
   Script Makes the Rounds
</P>
<P>
   Only a small percentage of ``Got Milk?'' ad ideas ever make it
onto the air. All TV commercials must pass through several hoops
before going into production, but regulated commodities face extra
hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   First, the milk scripts are vetted by the 10 directors of the
California Fluid Milk Processor Advisory Board. (The $25 million in
annual ``Got Milk?'' ad spending comes from a milk levy paid by
California processors. A separate, federally mandated Milk Mustache
campaign is funded by processors across the country.)
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Wholesome Family,'' processors ``loved the ad
because it's competitive'' with soda, said Jeff Manning, the
board's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   But the ad encountered fatal stumbling blocks at the next two
stages of the process, the California Department of Food and
Agriculture and the national television networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the approach implying that soda rots teeth is unfairly
disparaging and not acceptable,'' said one network, ABC, in a
rejection letter to Goodby, Silverstein. ``We also feel the
depiction of people with horribly rotten teeth may prove offensive
to many of our viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ABC guidelines forbid any depiction of dentures,
the network noted.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' rejection letter read, in part, ``It is unacceptable to
suggest, however humorously, that drinking soda will cause one's
teeth to rot and fall out.''
</P>
<P>
   Data Demanded
</P>
<P>
   The networks also demanded data to support the contention that
soda is bad for teeth _ a request that seems absurd since dentists
have been warning Americans about soda for years.
</P>
<P>
   But Bess Cocke, Goodby, Silverstein's broadcast liaison, said
the networks' response to ``Wholesome Family'' was not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Every advertising claim, from a whiter, brighter bleach to a
safer automobile, must be backed up with hard evidence. Each
network operates an internal research department to review such
data.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, network affiliates can have their licenses pulled
and networks can be sued for running a false advertising claim,
although such cases are extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   But while the networks' concerns weren't unexpected, their
rejection of ``Wholesome Family'' raised suspicions among the milk
marketers that other factors were at play.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the ad in question insults a product category, soft
drinks, that spends an estimated $1.3 billion a year on
advertising. That's more than 10 times as much as &UR;  &LR; milk.
</P>
<P>
   And the networks accepted another ``Got Milk?'' spot, ``Bones,''
that also contained a health claim _ but which did not insult soda.
In ``Bones,'' the arms of a calcium-deficient man, a nonmilk
drinker, break off when he attempts to lift a heavy wheelbarrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be clear that Coke and Pepsi spend a ton of money on TV
advertising,'' said Rick Kurnit, a partner with Frankfort, Garbus,
Klein &AMP; Selz in New York. ``Networks have a First Amendment right
to choose whether an ad will run or not, and they don't have to run
something they think will hurt their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, although soda is widely considered harmful to tooth
enamel, it isn't necessarily true that people who drink soda have
worse teeth than people who drink only milk, Kurnit added.
(Toothpaste is a big advertiser, too, after all.)
</P>
<P>
   Evidence Needed
</P>
<P>
   Spokespeople for CBS and ABC declined to comment. One network
executive, however, said his company needs ``hard evidence'' to
back up health claims, and ``Wholesome Family'' ``sort of went
overboard'' in its denigration of soda. (NBC rejected the ad with
no comment.)
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle was the disgusting visuals in ``Wholesome
Family.'' The last thing TV executives want is for viewers to
change channels because they were repulsed by an ad. But networks
sometimes allow such subject matter if it looks sufficiently
cartoonish and unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Network, in fact, accepted ``Wholesome Family'' on condition
that it be shot ``in an over-the-top, comical fashion,'' said
Cocke. And all of the networks have run a ``Got Milk?'' ad in which
a TV chef who eats a hot pepper (but runs out of milk) incinerates
in front of his studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   Goodby, Silverstein had one more card to play with the networks.
Executives there could have argued that the ad was simply ``a
humorous illustration of a truism'' about milk and should not be
taken as a serious claim, said Kurnit.
</P>
<P>
   That was the strategy used by Wendy's many years ago when
MacDonald's and Burger King challenged its ``Where's the Beef?''
ad. Wendy's rivals claimed the ad was misleading because it
depicted their product as a minuscule patty dwarfed by an enormous
bun.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, ``All Wendy's had to prove is that their patty
was a little bigger'' than its rivals, said Kurnit. That was the
real point of the ad, although the point was made through
exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   The milk marketers opted not take this tack with the networks,
however, for one reason: The ad had already died at the hands of
the California Department of Food and Agriculture, which oversees
all advertising funded by state commodity programs.
</P>
<P>
   Protection of Law
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, California law forbids commodity board-funded
advertising from disparaging other agricultural products, like
orange juice. But the department interprets the law to include any
agricultural derivative, including sweeteners or other ingredients
that might be found in soda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obligated to be fair to all commodities,'' said
department spokesman Oscar Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   The agriculture department was also concerned that the health
claims in ``Wholesome Family'' could not be substantiated, and
Manning allowed as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably could have found a study showing that if you leave
a tooth in a glass of soda it will rot, but it's also true that
there are billions of people who drink soda who have perfectly fine
teeth,'' Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   Producing the spot would have cost the processor board $400,000
to $500,000. At the same time, ``I would probably give it a 50
percent chance of being pulled in the first month,'' said Manning.
``If I felt better about the substantiation, we would have fought
for it, but I just don't think dental is the way to fight soda.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the Fight
</P>
<P>
   Manning still believes an anti-soda message could be effective
if the right script comes along. Part of the problem is finding a
plot that will pass muster with milk ads' many reviewers and still
be a hit with audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Other anti-soda scripts have been rejected before they even got
to the networks because they didn't go over well in focus groups.
One, for example, showed soda being poured over breakfast cereal.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Goodby, Silverstein is preparing three more ads in the
conventional mold, focusing on the partnership between milk and
sweets. A fourth spot, ``Y2Cud,'' which will appear on TV this
fall, takes a different approach, but does not broach the topics of
soda or health.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the milk versus soft drink battle is being waged in a
small way elsewhere. Another marketing group, the California Milk
Advisory Board, has spent more than $1 million sponsoring
extreme-game exhibitions at county fairs.
</P>
<P>
   But there won't be any anti-soda ``Got Milk?'' ads for the
foreseeable future. ``Someday, somehow we will take a shot at soda,
but (``Wholesome Family'') just wasn't the spot,'' said Manning.

   A state-funded study indicates that the handling fee of 2.25
cents per container that is paid to redemption centers and
retailers is not enough to cover their costs.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to deal with the redemption center problem,
according to the study, is to allow centers to pay consumers 4
cents for returned bottles and cans rather than the full 5-cent
deposit. The study did not address whether retailers should be
allowed to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts residents may also be losing interest in recycling
bottles and cans. Using preliminary numbers, the study said the
recycling rate for bottles and cans plunged last year from just
under 80 percent in 1997 to 69.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they plan to use the study to fashion
improvements to the bottle-deposit law. But retailers and beverage
industry officials long opposed to the law asked whether it makes
sense to invest more money in what they considered a bad system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best option for us is to get rid of the stupid thing,''
said Christopher Flynn, president of the Massachusetts Food
Association, which represents the state's supermarket industry.
``Does it make sense to throw millions of dollars more at a system
that is addressing only 1.5 percent of the state's waste stream?''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group,
which led the fight for the original deposit law and is pushing to
expand its reach to water and juice containers, said the law is the
most successful recycling law in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``As such, it's worth saving and indeed expanding,'' said Paul
Burns, Masspirg's environmental attorney. Burns described the
changes needed to fix problems with the existing law as ``minor
adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   The new study, ordered by the Legislature and conducted by DSM
Environmental Services of Ascutney, Vt., concluded that redemption
centers were telling the truth in recent years when they complained
that they were being driven out of business by inadequate handling
fees. The number of redemption centers has fallen from 250 in 1995
to 130 today.
</P>
<P>
   The study said the average actual cost of handling a container
at a redemption center is 2.57 cents per container. That's only
0.32 cents above the current compensation rate. Given the huge
volumes involved, the losses can accumulate to more than $1 million
a year for an average-size redemption center.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers have even higher costs, according to the study, but
they can offset them in other areas of their businesses. The study
offered limited retailer data, but two supermarket chains with
fairly sophisticated processing systems reported costs of 3.4 cents
and 6.8 cents per container.
</P>
<P>
   The study said redemption centers, which accept all brands of
containers in any quantity, play a crucial behind-the-scenes role
in bottle and can recycling. They handle an estimated 39 percent of
all returns and cater to people who return large quantities. If
redemption centers continue to fail, the report said, recycling
rates will fall and retailers and beverage distributors will be
faced with higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   The study said the least expensive way to stop the decline of
redemption centers would be to allow them to pay consumers 4 cents
instead of 5 cents for every returned container.
</P>
<P>
   This approach would not add new costs to the system. DSM surveys
also indicated that 87 percent of those returning containers to
redemption centers probably would continue to do so even at the
lower rate, partly out of convenience and because in many cases
they recovered the containers from the trash and didn't pay the
initial 5-cent deposit. Those who want the full deposit could still
return the container to a retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paying less than 5 cents potentially starts the Commonwealth
down a slippery slope where the value of deposit containers is
significantly diminished and with it the value of returning
containers,'' the report noted. But the report said that already
may be happening, since the 5-cent deposit has remained unchanged
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said giving consumers only 4 cents back would shake
confidence in the bottle-deposit system. Robert Renzi, co-owner of
Bottle Bill's Redemption Center in Framingham, called the proposal
``bad for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Several redemption centers already are paying out 4 cents. The
state attorney general's office filed suit against them, but a
judge recently denied a request for a preliminary injunction. A
spokeswoman for the attorney general's office said she didn't know
the current status of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Other options considered in the report included raising the
handling fee to as high as 3 cents or allowing redemption centers
to charge a higher handling fee to beverage distributors who don't
pick up their empty containers. Both options, according to the
report, would increase the costs of beverage distributors by $2.2
million to $11.2 million and could force an increase in beverage
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Burns was skeptical that price increases would result. ``It's
possible that they might do that,'' he said of distributors. ``It's
also possible they might see the need to compete in the marketplace
and take the money out of their profits.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials said another option would be to use a portion of
unclaimed deposits to shore up the deposit system. The state
currently gets all unclaimed deposits and uses the money for
environmental programs. Total unclaimed deposits are expected to be
$25 million this year.

SMOLINSKI SIGNS ONE-YEAR CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles Kings general manager Dave Taylor shortened his list
of free agents by one Friday as newly acquired center Bryan
Smolinski agreed to terms on a one-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski, 27, accompanied Zigmund Palffy to the Kings in last
month's eight-player trade with the New York Islanders, and can be
penciled in as the Kings' second-line center behind Jozef Stumpel.
</P>
<P>
   After a mediocre 1998-99 season in which he produced only 40
points, Smolinski, a restricted free agent, agreed to the Kings'
qualifying offer, and receives a contract worth about $1.75
million, the same amount he made last season. Smolinski will be a
restricted free agent again in one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acquiring Bryan was very important to us when we made our deal
with the Islanders,'' Taylor said. ``He is a proven NHL scorer who
will add a lot of offense to our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski has played six seasons in the NHL, for the Islanders,
Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins, producing 289 points in 444
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ecstatic,'' Smolinski said. ``My wife and I are thrilled
to be coming to Los Angeles. I have already bought a house there
and I am really excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks remain until the Sept. 5 start of training camp, and
Taylor has several more restricted free agents to sign, most
notably defenseman Mattias Norstrom, right wing Glen Murray and
goalie Stephane Fiset. These negotiations may be considerably
trickier than the swift resolution with Smolinski.
</P>
<P>
   Also unsigned is defenseman Aki Berg, who played last season in
his native Finland after a contract impasse with the Kings, and is
threatening to do so again this year.
</P>
<P>
   The season begins Oct. 2 in Nashville.

 INDIAN WELLS WATER CO. GOES UNDER  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Indian Wells Water Co., the Sonoma, Calif., startup
that had ambitious plans to market bottled water for the benefit of
American Indians, announced Friday that it has pulled the plug and
is filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
<P>
   When The Chronicle wrote about the company in March, CEO Jim
Stevens, a veteran of Perrier and Coca-Cola, was enthusiastic about
the company's plans to carve a niche in the $4.3 billion U.S.
bottled water market.
</P>
<P>
   It was going to do this by tapping springs and building bottling
plants on tribal lands, hiring local residents and returning
profits to American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Mille Lacs Band of Minnesota's Ojibwe tribe also was excited
about the idea. It invested $10 million for a 10 percent stake in
Indian Wells, and five other tribes, including the Washoe near
Carson City, were developing springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal,'' said Brian McCarthy, who was company president at
the time of the interview, ``is to help American Indians develop a
new economic template besides casinos.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first story was published, The Chronicle ran a second
article after it learned that McCarthy had led several previous
ventures that failed. These included an earlier version of Indian
Wells, another Bay Area water company called Watermark and a real
estate partnership named Brichard &AMP; Co. After theses disclosures,
Indian Wells said it was ``re-evaluating the role'' of McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Indian Wells hired BKS International Business
Consultancy in San Francisco to assess its prospects. BKS principal
Brian Service said that after conducting a study with New York's
Beverage Marketing Corp., it was determined that ``competitive
pressures in the rapidly consolidating bottled water business made
it impossible for Indian Wells to become a profitable venture and
it should cease operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Service, who has been hired as interim manager of Indian Wells,
said the company plans to meet all its financial obligations to its
trade partners. However, he said he did not know how much of the
$10 million invested by the Milles Lacs, some of it still in
escrow, could be returned to the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Wells' officers and directors reportedly are resigning
from the company and none of them could be reached for comment
yesterday. Neither could tribal investors.
</P>
<P>
   Service said allegations against McCarthy were not important
factors in Indian Wells' demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very competitive market,'' said Don Saccani, whose
company distributed Indian Wells in Marin. ``Sales were only fair _
nowhere near the penetration of Calistoga or Crystal Geyser.''

CASE STRENGTHENS FOR PILOT ERROR IN KENNEDY CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wreckage of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s airplane has shown no sign
of mechanical or structural failure, making it almost certain that
pilot error caused the crash that killed him, his wife and his
sister-in-law, according to a high-ranking aviation source familiar
with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   While the NTSB has said it will be months before a precise
determination can be made into the cause of the crash,
investigators are still waiting to determine if the plane's radio,
avionics and selected cockpit instruments were working.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kennedy was not licensed to fly using instruments alone.
And, as a pilot, he should not have flown in weather conditions
that required him to fly by continually scanning the gauges on the
cockpit panel, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if the instruments weren't working because
legally he could not rely on them alone to fly the airplane,'' said
a high-ranking federal aviation official familiar with the
investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are looking to hang your (investigation) out on the
instruments being bad, you can't because he was not approved to
rely on them,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had his private pilot's license for more than a year,
had accumulated about 300 hours of flight time, and was studying to
become an instrument-rated pilot.
</P>
<P>
   But under his license, Kennedy was a visual-flight-rules pilot,
meaning he could only fly by what he could see, and was grounded
when visibility was less than three miles and the cloud ceiling
lower than 1,000 feet. Such conditions can cause even experienced
pilots to become disoriented and lose control of the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the plane's automatic pilot was broken, the source said,
Kennedy should have maintained control of the airplane and kept
track of the environment around him so that if weather
deteriorated, or he flew into an area of poor visibility, he could
head back to clearer air.
</P>
<P>
   The source also said the preliminary investigation into the
cockpit instruments has yet to find one not working.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the vacuum pump, which drives the attitude
indicator, a gauge which enables instrument pilots to keep the
wings level, was functional, the source said. The attitude
indicator, which is designed to mimic the position of an aircraft's
wings in relation to the horizon, is crucial to maintaining control
of the airplane when the horizon is obscured.
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement Friday, the NTSB said Kennedy had received
an Internet weather briefing at about 6:30 the night of the
accident for conditions from New Jersey to Cape Cod. The flight
left Essex County Airport in Caldwell, N.J., at 8:38 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was headed to Martha's Vineyard to drop off his
sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette. He and his wife were then expected
to fly to Hyannis Port for his cousin Rory Kennedy's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report was for good VFR (visual flight rules) weather,
visibility 6 to 8 miles,'' the NTSB statement said. There were no
significant weather advisories along the route, and ``all airports
along the route of flight reported visual meteorological
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   However, pilots who had flown over Long Island Sound that
evening reported after the accident that the in-flight visibility
over the water ``was significantly reduced,'' according to the NTSB
statement, which noted that interviews of those pilots will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Several radar tapes indicate Kennedy flew along the southern
Connecticut shore and turned right, over the ocean, at Westerly,
R.I., for Martha's Vineyard. That turn began a track of more than
40 miles across open water.
</P>
<P>
   Flying on a heading to Martha's Vineyard, Kennedy's plane
descended from 5,600 feet to 2,300 feet, and then veered off course
to the right, when he was about 18 miles from the airport. The
course was corrected, but the plane turned to the right again and
began to dive toward the Atlantic at a rate in excess of 5,000 feet
per minute.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuver, aviation sources said, is indicative of a pilot
who has lost awareness of his flight situation and is suffering
from spatial disorientation, which makes it difficult _ if not
impossible _ to recover from such a dive.
</P>
<P>
   It took about 30 seconds for Kennedy's plane _ which was at a
relately low altitude _ to go from controlled, even flight to
slamming into the water.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB said Friday that the Navy salvage ship USS Grasp
recovered about 75 percent of the fuselage of Kennedy's plane from
the ocean floor about 7 1/2 miles from Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Included in the recovered wreckage was approximately 80
percent of the left wing, 60 percent of the right wing, the engine
and propeller, and the cockpit instrument panel,'' the NTSB said.
``Examination . . . has revealed no evidence of an in-flight
break-up or fire, and no indication of pre-impact failure to the
airframe.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording device on board the airplane, as first reported by
The Boston Globe, was recovered. But the force of the impact
destroyed it, and investigators could not determine if it had been
operating, a source said.

UMPIRES PLAN UNFAIR LABOR CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Phillips, the head of the major league umpires union,
spent an intensive day Friday preparing unfair labor practice
charges the union plans to file with the National Labor Relations
Board early next week.
</P>
<P>
   The NLRB will be the second front the union opens in its fight
to restore the jobs of 22 of its members. Earlier this week the
union filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia trying
to prevent the loss of those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips did not return telephone calls seeking comment on the
charges he plans to file with the NLRB, but in discussing the
umpires' plight Thursday night, he accused Major League Baseball of
blatantly bad behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a definite charade in baseball today,'' he said.
``I'm not going to go into it any further. We're working together
with Bruce Simon, who is a very experienced labor counsel from New
York, on this and we have a single purpose in mind. That purpose is
to make certain the things that have happened in baseball find the
sunlight in the light of day.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting specifically on the National League's acceptance of
the resignations of 13 umpires earlier that day, the lawyer said,
``I think today they have served up probably the most blatant
unfair labor practice that I have ever seen. I have been practicing
for 33 years. I've never seen anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Other labor experts, however, have questioned Phillips' strategy
in having the umpires resign en masse. That act, the experts have
said, gave baseball officials the right to accept any of the
resignations they chose, effective Sept. 2, the date stated in the
letters. ''Once you sign it and send it,'' one person with vast
union experience said Friday, ``you now assume to be someone who
will be an ex-employee on the effective date. You're not even
guaranteed being an employee until that time. Even if the employer
doesn't respond by saying I accept your resignation, it is still an
effective resignation and nothing you do can change that without
the permission from the one you resigned from.''
</P>
<P>
   Some labor people said they couldn't understand why Phillips
faxed the resignation letters to the league offices the day after
more than 50 umpires signed them. They said Phillips could easily
have held them, and whatever his strategy was, used the letters for
that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   By submitting them to the league offices, he put them in the
hands of the league presidents, giving them the right and the
opportunity to accept as many and whichever resignations they
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Two umpires who have opposed Phillips' strategy have said they
gained the impression at the July 14 meeting that the union was
going to hold the letters and not send them to the league offices.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were shocked the next day when they learned that
the letters had been sent. After receiving the letters, the
American League hired 12 minor league umpires and the National
League hired 13. The AL then accepted the resignations of the nine
umpires who did not revoke their resignations.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two NL umpires withdrew theirs last Tuesday, but because
the league had already hired 13 new umpires, it accepted the
resignations of the like number of staff umpires Thursday.

EX-AG HARSHBARGER TO HEAD   COMMON CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Having built a career on political ethics and
government reform, former Massachusetts Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger is about to pursue those goals full-time as president
of Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger, who won the 1998 Democratic gubernatorial
nomination but lost the November general election, was elected
president of the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization
Friday and will begin his new job in September.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger has been mandated with reinvigorating the
29-year-old organization, a self-described ``nonpartisan citizens'
lobbying group'' that advocates campaign finance reform, government
ethics, and grassroots political participation.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has a membership of more than 200,000 and an
annual budget of about $10 million, but its influence and relevance
have waned in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been specifically asked to broaden the agenda of Common
Cause,'' Harshbarger said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal here is to try to shape this third force representing
the public interest in a far more powerful way, to overcome the
incredible cynicism'' directed toward government, Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger has long been a good-government reformer, dating
back to his tenure as general counsel for the Massachusetts Ethics
Commission from 1978 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected attorney general in 1990 and served two terms
before narrowly losing his gubernatorial bid to Paul Cellucci in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger replaces Ann McBride, who left Common Cause in May.
Common Cause board chairman Derek Bok praised McBride's tenure
Friday, but he said the organization had become too narrowly
focused on winning campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaign finance reform is going to remain a very important
part of the agenda, but I think it perhaps became too dominant, and
maybe we didn't make it clear enough that campaign finance reform
is a means to an end,'' Bok said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to trying to introduce important reforms, we need
to be working on the broader fundamental task of getting Americans
excited about how their democracy works.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Friday what Harshbarger's new post bodes for his
political future. Though many Democratic activists were frustrated
by his 1998 campaign, Harshbarger had explored the possibility of a
comeback in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Harshbarger said he made no promises to the Common Cause
board about his political intentions.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that ``at this point in time, elected office is the
last thing on my mind.'' And Common Cause board members said
Harshbarger had assuaged their concerns that he might see the job
as a stepping stone to political office.
</P>
<P>
   While some saw Harshbarger's move to Washington as a sign that
he was withdrawing from the Massachusetts political arena, others
said the new position was an opportunity for Harshbarger to
refurbish his image here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly does not foreclose any of his political
options. If anything, it gives him a bigger platform,'' said
longtime Harshbarger aide Ed Cafasso.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signal here is that he's not prepared to be mothballed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some board members wondered whether a partisan former elected
official might endanger Common Cause's reputation for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only concern among some members was having a politician in
the job,'' said one source familiar with the organization's search
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual for Common Cause, particularly to have someone
who ran for office so recently. Common Cause prides itself on being
a nonpartisan organization that works in a bipartisan way,'' the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   But Harshbarger said having a former elected official at the
helm would bring the group credibility with other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Harsharger said that he will be in Washington ``full-time'' to
run Common Cause, but that he will commute regularly to Boston.
Harshbarger still plans to teach a course at Harvard Law School
this fall, and he will maintain his affiliation with Northeastern
University, where he teaches criminal law.

 LEVI'S TURNS TO TV SEX, HUMOR TO LURE BACK CUSTOMERS  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Can Levi's seduce its way into the shopping bags of
jeans-buyers?
<P>
   Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. of San Francisco is taking a 180-degree turn
in its advertising, with new television spots that rely on humor
and sex instead of earnest authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which begin airing August 16, promote new styles in the
company's flagship Red Tab product line and carry a new tag line,
``Opt. For the Original.''
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in Red Tab is responsible for most of the 17 percent
drop in sales the company experienced in 1997 and 1998. And the
hemorrhaging hasn't stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The company was forced to steeply discount much of its Levi's
brand merchandise in the first six months of the current fiscal
year, sending U.S. Levi's sales down 10.8 percent for that period,
according to a source close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the new ads revolve around seduction scenes. One uses
special effects to show an invisible man being seduced by an
invisible woman, just as his invisible mother decides to drop by
unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   The second portrays a sexy artist who likes to seduce men and
use their Levi's jeans in her paintings.
</P>
<P>
   In a third spot, which will air early next year, a beautiful
young woman strips off her jeans and lays them in front of an
oncoming train to create cutoff shorts.
</P>
<P>
   The spots are a far cry from the company's last round of ads,
which carried the tag line ``What's True'' and featured urban youth
(not actors) giving earnest, unscripted monologues about their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Dee, Levi's brand director, declined to provide a budget
for the latest campaign but said it would be significantly higher
than that of What's True.
</P>
<P>
   What's True had several problems, said Dee. Consumers found the
ads too serious, Baby Boomers were offended by spots on topics like
drug abuse, and the campaign did not highlight Levi's merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign is meant to showcase new Red Tab products,
particularly slim-fit jeans, and remedy the other problems as well,
Dee said. Both campaigns were created by TBWA/Chiat/Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that (the new, humorous strategy) is a smart
move,'' said Greg Stern, a principal with the ad agency Butler,
Shine &AMP; Stern in Sausalito, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's purely advertising as entertainment,'' a strategy that
has proven successful for Levi's rival Lee jeans, said Stern, whose
clients include Levi's retailer Miller's Outpost.
</P>
<P>
   But the San Francisco jeansmaker seems to be sending a mixed
message by combining its ``Opt. For the Original'' tag line and the
fun, sexy ads, Stern said. ``There seems to be a disconnect
there.''

CLINTON OFFERS U.S. AID AT MEETING IN BALKANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia _ President Clinton held out a series of
economic incentives to struggling Balkan democracies Friday and
pledged modest financial assistance to pro-democracy forces inside
Serbia to further destabilize the government of President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with leaders of Europe and the industrialized nations to
kick off the Balkan Stability Pact, the president pledged to
strengthen U.S. trade and investment in the historically
impoverished countries as they embrace economic and democratic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the streets of Sarajevo were deserted except for
heavily armed security forces, one of the haunting reminders of the
fragile peace imposed in 1995, ending the four-year Bosnian war. A
short distance from the sports arena where the leaders met were a
high school that was near the center of battle and a soccer field
that was converted to a cemetery for the war dead.
</P>
<P>
   While he was first to offer a specific aid package to the former
communist states during Friday's Sarajevo summit, Clinton noted
that the European Union would take the lead in rebuilding the
Balkans. The effort is likened to the rebuilding of western Europe
under the post-World War II Marshall Plan and the aid given Central
European countries when the Iron Curtain fell a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The region's partners in Europe and North America must do our
part to help the nations of (southeastern Europe) to stand on their
feet, to remove obstacles to trade and to encourage investment,''
Clinton said in remarks prepared for delivery during the
three-hour, closed-door gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and several European leaders, who met at the site of the
1984 Winter Olympics, repeatedly stressed their opposition to
Milosevic and willingness to include Serbia in regional security
and economic efforts if he is replaced by a pro-democracy leader.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they outlined plans to bolster Milosevic's
opponents inside Serbia and urged Balkan leaders to assist.
Milosevic faces charges of war crimes stemming from atrocities
committed against ethnic Albanians who are the majority in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbia will only have a future when Mr. Milosevic and his
policies are consigned to the past,'' Clinton said. ``Those who
have experience leading a democratic transition can offer
invaluable assistance and advice to those who aspire to lead one in
Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Clinton said he would ask Congress to set aside
$10 million this year _ and more in the next two years _ to support
independent media, trade unions and the democratic opposition
inside Serbia. In addition, he promised to establish a $150 million
investment fund for the Balkans and provide a $200 million credit
line through the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp. He also
said he would urge Congress to lower trade barriers so Balkan
countries could export goods to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Bodo Hombach, a former top aide to German Chancellor Gerhardt
Schroeder, said the region is ``waiting impatiently for the
democratization of Yugoslavia.'' Hombach, the EU's Balkan
coordinator, told summit participants that part of that effort was
a conference of municipal leaders, including pro-Western mayors
from Serbia, being convened later this summer in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   A formal declaration signed by summit participants expressed
``regret'' that Yugoslavia, the federation of which Serbia is the
dominant element, could not be a part of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appeal to the (Serb) people ... to embrace democratic
change and work actively for regional reconciliation,'' the
declaration says.
</P>
<P>
   To aid the democratic movement, the document says, European
leaders and their allies will seek ways to extend benefits of the
Balkan Stability Pact to Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in the
Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later if the United States and its allies were seeking a
Serbian civil war to oust Milosevic, White House national security
adviser Sandy Berger said he would not ``prescribe to the Serbian
people how they handle and change governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic ``still has control of the apparatus of oppression,
and that is not easy to overcome,'' Berger said. ``But I have faith
in the Serbian people, that they will find a way to do that. Our
role is to provide assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Balkan participants in the summit _ Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria,
Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia and Romania _ agreed to move toward
market economies and more stable, democratic governments. In
addition, they agreed to cooperate in regional security, to open
their borders to the return of refugees, and to recognize the
rights of national minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our shared objective is the development of peaceful and good
neighborly relations,'' the summit participants declared, agreeing
to downsize their military forces and shift defense funds into
economic development.
</P>
<P>
   When the summit adjourned, Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright toured the nearby high school, a multiethnic
facility being rebuilt with U.S. aid. They were accompanied by
17-year-old Adnan Memic, who walks with a limp from shrapnel that
struck his leg seven years ago as he waited for a bus.
</P>
<P>
   Memic directed Clinton, Albright and a small entourage through
the school's wartime history, which included a stint as a military
barracks. In one classroom, its walls pock-marked by bullets, Memic
told the group that ``no living man could walk through this room
where we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just across the river were Serb fighters,'' he said, gesturing
across a tree-shaded street to the Miljacka River about 50 yards
away. ``There were so many shells and rifle fire that not even the
military could be here for long.''
</P>
<P>
   During a brief speech to students, faculty and diplomats,
Clinton called the rebuilding of the school a symbol of Bosnia's
future. ``It is not enough to end a war; we must build a peace,''
the president said. ``It is not enough to reject a dark past; we
must build a bright future.''

IT WAS AS IF AN OCCULT HAND HAD . . .  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It's something of a ritual around these parts. The
Yankees come to town to kick some Boston butt and the Red Sox are
embroiled in controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's pummeling at the hands of the Yanks was mildly
reminiscent of the Boston Massacre of 1978, but again the Sox were
making news off the field. In these final days of July, the Sox
have provided the X (-Ray) Files of Tom Gordon, and Nomar
Garciaparra's not-so-subtle blasts at Sox owner/physician Arthur
Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Stephen King when you really need him? Clearly the Sox
fan-author placed some kind of curse of himself and Boston's ace
closer when he penned, ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.'' The book
was just taking its place on the bestseller list when both King and
Gordon were lost for the season. Why couldn't King have done us all
a favor and written ``The Girl Who Loved Mark Portugal?'' or ``The
Girl Who Loved John Wasdin''?
</P>
<P>
   Gordon got mad this week when he learned that his MRI results
took 13 days to get from Massachusetts to Dr. James Andrews's
office in Alabama. Gordon challenged Dr. Pappas's lack of urgency,
then critiqued the Doc's diagnosis after Dr. Andrews finally closed
the curtain on Gordon's season.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling Gordon's pain, Boston's wonderboy shortstop joined the
chorus line of current and former Sox players who've questioned
their care under Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our doctors are killing us,'' Garciaparra said Wednesday when
it was learned Gordon was done for the year. ``This is just like
the bone bruise (Lou Merloni's injury turned into a stress fracture
last year).''
</P>
<P>
   Nomar wasn't backing off Friday night. He told the Globe's
Gordon Edes, ``We lost our closer. Why did it have to take this
long? Wait this long, so we don't have him next year, too?''
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: When it absolutely, positively, has to be
there overnight, make sure not to leave it on the desk of Dr.
Arthur Pappas. Apparently, Gordon's MRI results got caught in the
same ``out'' basket that swallowed Carlton Fisk's contract renewal
all those years ago. Next time, why don't the Sox save some dough,
wait till February, and put the folder on the Sox' Florida-bound
equipment truck? Just schedule a stop at Andrews's office in
Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no excuse for the 13-day delay in getting Gordon's
files to Andrews, but questioning the quality of care _ and the
motives of the conflicted Dr. Pappas _ is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of history here. Pappas is a kind man and there's
plenty of evidence that he's a superior doctor, but his dual-role
is bothersome to many players and the conflict is particularly
dicey when the Doc swings and misses.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was upset last year when Pappas struggled with the
diagnosis of Merloni. The Doc saw a bone bruise that turned out to
be a stress fracture. Saturday's starter, Brian Rose, hurt his
elbow early in 1998, but the severity of his injury went undetected
until Andrews discovered Rose had a stress fracture and bone spur
that was tugging on the ligament in his elbow. Dr. Pappas last
summer told Reggie Jefferson he had a back sprain, but Jefferson
visited back specialist Robert Watkins, who discovered a stress
fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former Sox pitcher Butch Henry still claims Pappas
last year told him he could pitch despite having a tear in the
anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee. Seven years ago,
former Sox second baseman Marty Barrett sued the team and Pappas,
claiming his career was cut short because of Pappas's misdiagnosis.
A US District Court jury awarded Barrett $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is the Gordon mess and Pappas again is defending
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Doc-as-owner conflict is old news around here and it's
apparent that Pappas is intent on wearing both hats indefinitely.
What makes this latest episode interesting is Garciaparra's
outspoken stance. When Gordon gave his teammates the sad news
Wednesday in Toronto, Nomar started ripping.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas was wounded by the attack and it's got to be a shocker
for the Duke. Nomar has always been Dan Duquette's guy. He is David
to Duquette's Michaelangelo. Nomar was drafted by Dan, groomed by
Dan, and signed to a multiyear contract by Dan. Duquette calls
Nomar ``a real baseball player,'' which is the ultimate compliment
in the boring language that is Dukespeak.
</P>
<P>
   But now for the second time this year, Garciaparra is taking a
stand. He broke his career-long silence and blasted management when
Merloni was sent down earlier this season and Friday night
continued to critique Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk to Butch Henry,'' said Garciaparra. ``Ask him. Give him a
call. Tim Naehring? Yeah, there's another name. I'm sure there's a
list.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a list. And Nomar is mad. And the Sox are reeling (who
could have known that Jose Offerman's final 1999 appearance at
Fenway Park would be in the All-Star Game?)
</P>
<P>

CARROLL NEEDS TO SHOW HE'S HOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Lawyer Milloy's cream-colored Lexus LX470 was
parked in a Bryant College fire lane Friday. It was the most
appropriate space on campus. There were overheated words spiraling
from Milloy's vehicle. At some point, I imagine the words took on
wings and circled the area until they burned the backside of Pete
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   As Milloy sat in his luxurious driver's seat, he spoke of
management/coaching absurdities, death and war. His words should
make one thing clear to Carroll: The term ``hot seat'' is more than
a cliche. It is the place where the coach now sits, with seat belt
strapped on. If he doesn't see that _ and confront it _ he'll
certainly be jobless by midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has to realize that something was terribly wrong with
Friday's opening of Patriots training camp. Usually Day 1 is when
head coaches determine what the tone of the late summer will be.
They speak confidently and defiantly. They encourage some players
and make others fear for their jobs. Carroll tried some of that
early in the afternoon. He said he was excited about a challenging
season and was not concerned about the gloomy predictions of
outside critics. He didn't mention the insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Milloy, angry with the team's decision to release fellow
safety Willie Clay, questioned the coach without mentioning him by
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your job is on the line, why are you going to get rid of
somebody who's been out there every play for you?'' Milloy said.
</P>
<P>
   This is probably not what Carroll had in mind when he said
earlier in the day that Milloy was ready to step into a leadership
role. He was talking about on the field. Milloy took it further
than that. He took it straight to the fire (lane).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that these guys understand that we go to war,''
Milloy said, referring to either the coaching staff, management or
segments of both. He said he would ``die for all my teammates,''
but added that the Pats whose replica jerseys are so popular with
young fans ``are not the true football players on our team . . .
they're letting a lot of the true players go. It's getting
ridiculous around here.''
</P>
<P>
   After saying that the release of Clay was a ``bad move'' that
hurt the team, Milloy was asked again what he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think? What do you think? What do you think I
think?''
</P>
<P>
   To answer his question, I think he thinks that there are minimal
consequences, if any, to be paid for his veiled criticism of
teammates and obvious criticism of the man who coaches him. And I
think he's right.
</P>
<P>
   Think of all the Boston pro coaches and how they would react to
one of their players challenging them. It wouldn't happen with the
Bruins and Pat Burns. Rick Pitino once told the Celtics that if
they ever criticized him publicly, they would be very sorry
(Antoine Walker is the only one who tested him). As unhappy as Jose
Offerman is about losing his job, you don't hear the Red Sox second
baseman angrily challenging the decisions of Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Even when players ferociously go at management with other Boston
teams, the teams respond. Dr. Arthur Pappas quickly responded when
the Sox recently questioned his methods; Harry Sinden traded Adam
Oates when the center said that Bruins management was at fault for
the horrible 1996-97 season; the Celtics have explored trading
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Milloy's words should not be misunderstood as ``Hey, I miss
Willie; I'll be really sad to see him go.'' There was some
accumulated frustration in those comments.
</P>
<P>
   Watch Carroll and Pats management in the next few weeks. Their
actions will give you a preview of Carroll's future. The team
already cut Clay, knowing that he was not a fan of Carroll's and
frequently dogged the coach. But Bobby Grier and Carroll have to
know Clay is not the only player who fits that profile. And if they
didn't know before Friday, they should have some questions this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I will tell you that I like Carroll personally. He is a
true sports fan, a man who has played basketball, baseball, and
football at a high level. He is approachable. He is pleasant. But
any head coach in any sport knows that when players and coaches are
battling, the players win. So the coaches combat that by making
sure that they always have more control than the men they coach. If
they are going to be fired, they figure, they will be fired for the
team's on-field performance, not its divisiveness off it.
</P>
<P>
   The question everyone, including Carroll, should be asking now
is this: Whose team is this? The obvious answer is Carroll's, since
he is the coach. But have you ever subletted a house? You're paying
for it and you're living in it, but you know it's not yours. There
are still comments and memories here of the silver-haired former
coach with the fishy nickname. There are still whispers about those
who respect the current coach and those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   So, two weeks before the first preseason game, that is Carroll's
challenge. He has to make this team follow him before he can worry
about the Jets, Dolphins, and Bills. You know what will happpen if
he can't.
</P>
<P>
   When Milloy finally finished talking Friday, he pulled out of
the fire lane and turned up his music. It was clearly hiphop. But
for a moment, I swear I heard Carroll singing James Brown's ``Hot
Pants.''

WITH ONE SWIFT KICK, THE METS AVOID GETTING BURNED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Growing up in the Dominican Republic, Armando Benitez
never played hockey. But Friday, on just about the hottest day
anyone could remember at Wrigley Field, Benitez made a kick save
worthy of a goalie to preserve the New York Mets' wild 10-9 victory
over the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   With one run already in, the Mets in danger of squandering an
improbable comeback from five runs down, and runners on first and
third with two out, Benitez knocked down Tyler Houston's line drive
with his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez, who momentarily lost the ball, found it in front of the
mound. He bent over, grasped, came up with air, reached down again,
picked the ball up and rifled it to first base, barely beating
Houston to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   So what if the play was not very pretty? To the Mets (62-42),
who are challenging the Atlanta Braves for first place in the
National League East, it was a thing of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the Mets' general manager, Steve Phillips, would
make a move or moves before the trading deadline of midnight
Saturday mattered little in the flush of victory Friday. What
mattered most was that Benitez's play ended 3 hours 29 minutes of
torture on a day when the temperature inched over 120 degrees on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Venezuela, it gets hot, but not like this,'' said Edgardo
Alfonzo, who played the entire game at second base for the Mets.
``In the second inning, I felt like I was in the sauna.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was because the Mets had to stand out in the sun for
nearly 30 minutes as the Cubs scored six runs.
</P>
<P>
   Masato Yoshii pitched as if he were auditioning for a bullpen
role. He just may have earned the part.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii allowed seven runs and eight hits on 41 pitches in 1 1/3
innings, the shortest outing by a Mets starter in nearly two years.
He could not hold leads of 1-0 and 2-1. And he gave up a home run
to Sammy Sosa, his 38th.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sosa's shot came in the first inning and sailed into the
bleachers beneath the hand-operated scoreboard. The blast, which
traveled an estimated 465 feet, was a sign of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Sosa was the last batter Yoshii faced.
This time, Sosa launched a moon shot that backed Rickey Henderson
against the ivy in left field. The ball dropped behind Henderson
and off the ivy, while Sosa, who initially thought he had another
homer, had to hustle his way to third, sliding head-first for a
run-scoring triple.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Cubs back-to-back triples (Mickey Morandini's had
driven in two runs), not to mention six consecutive hits off
Yoshii. And when Pat Mahomes allowed a run-scoring double to Mark
Grace, the Cubs had seven straight hits to score six times for a
7-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Mahomes settled down and tossed 4 2/3 strong innings. And
the Mets battled back in the oppressive heat.
</P>
<P>
   As many of the 38,594 fans on hand sought shelter from the sun,
(some were mercifully hosed down behind right field), and while WGN
television experienced technical difficulties because its
television trucks were too hot, the Mets scored in every inning
though the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   They knocked Steve Trachsel from the game in the fourth. Staked
to the five-run lead, Trachsel immediately gave two runs back in
the top of the third when he served up Mike Piazza's 21st homer of
the season with John Olerud on first base.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored twice more in the fourth to cut the deficit to
7-6, on a leadoff double by Brian McRae, a run-scoring one-out
double from Mahomes, Curtis Goodwin's throwing error that allowed
Mahomes to move to third and Henderson's run-scoring groundout off
reliever Scott Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets briefly took the lead in the fifth with two more runs,
even though Olerud was thrown out at the plate when third base
coach Cookie Rojas questionably sent him home on Piazza's line
single to left that popped out of the diving Henry Rodriguez's
glove. Piazza took second on the throw home, then scored an out
later on Benny Agbayani's two-out double inside the first base
line. McRae walked, and when Rey Ordonez lined a run-scoring single
to center, it gave the Mets an 8-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Hernandez erased the lead with a two-out homer in the fifth
off Mahomes. But Henderson led off the Mets' sixth with a solo
shot, his ninth homer of the season, off Kyle Farnsworth. And when
Olerud homered off Rick Aguilera to lead off the ninth, the Mets
were two runs in front.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they were able to make the lead stand up _ by the
length of Benitez's right foot.

YANKEES HAVE A DEAL FOR PETTITTE, IF THEY WANT IT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The New York Yankees have a trade for Andy Pettitte
they can accept or reject, they are on the verge of acquiring
former Yankee Jim Leyritz, and they are engaged in serious talks
with Baltimore for Arthur Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   With Saturday's trade deadline looming, if the Yankees acquire a
major league pitcher or two, like Rhodes or Tampa Bay's Roberto
Hernandez, they are expected to trade Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, has been frequently
conversing with the Anaheim Angels about Chuck Finley, although
Anaheim executives are becoming more convinced that Cashman is not
really interested in the left-hander and is more intent on driving
up the price on Finley for the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians have offered second baseman Enrique Wilson and first
baseman Willie Martinez for Finley, but the Angels, who traded
second baseman Randy Velarde to Oakland on Wednesday to clear a
spot for a second baseman like Wilson, want another minor-leaguer
from the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have talked to perhaps 10 teams about Pettitte, but
if they trade him it appears it will be to Philadelphia. The two
sides have settled on two prospects, and it is a matter of the
Yankees' going ahead with the deal. In all likelihood, the two are
right-handed pitcher Adam Eaton and outfielder Reggie Taylor, both
of whom were high draft picks currently playing in the minor
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, 27, has 75 victories in less than five seasons with
the Yankees, but he is being shopped primarily because his
performance this year (7-8, 5.65 ERA) isn't living up to his $5.95
million salary. Pettitte is due for a hefty raise next year because
he is eligible for arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre participated in two Yankees conference calls
Friday as club officials debated the possible deals. Torre said he
could understand both sides of the argument on trading Pettitte.
``I can't defend what he's done,'' Torre said, referring to
Pettitte's numbers this year. ``I can only defend on how he's
pitched in the past, and if he can come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, the Phillies' No. 1 draft pick in 1996, is a hard thrower
whose fastball recently was clocked at 97 mph. Taylor is an
extremely fast center fielder who was selected the top defensive
outfielder in the Florida State League in 1997. The Yankees have
also talked to the Giants about a deal for Pettitte _ possibly for
pitcher Shawn Estes _ as well as with the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   In return for Rhodes, the Orioles have asked the Yankees for
D'Angelo Jimenez, a Triple-A shortstop, as well as hard-throwing
pitcher Luis DeLosSantos; the Yankees may want to replace
DeLosSantos in the deal. Rhodes, 29, is having an off year, with a
6.17 ERA, but scouts who have seen him recently say that if he is
used in a certain way _ Rhodes is good at pitching an inning or two
at a time every other day, rather than every day _ he has the most
dominant stuff of any left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, 35, has been injured and missed most of this season,
but the Yankees would like to get him to help their bench and give
them added depth for the rest of the season and the playoffs; his
career playoff record includes seven home runs in 58 at-bats. The
Padres would receive a minor-league pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, an American League All-Star this season, would
greatly augment the Yankees' bullpen as a setup man for Mariano
Rivera, but there are potential complications. Foremost, Tampa Bay
has asked about several players, including Alfonso Soriano, perhaps
the most coveted prospect in the Yankees' system, and at the very
least the Devil Rays wouldn't make a deal without inclusion of the
star Double-A first baseman Nick Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, too, is earning $6 million this year and will make
that amount for each of the next two years; if the Yankees were to
acquire him, they very likely would then trade him in the
off-season, rather than pay a middle reliever such a high salary.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees continue to talk about Finley _ others say they have
offered Pettitte, a player in whom the Angels apparently have no
interest. The Yankees' desire to obtain Finley may be muted by the
fact that they want him primarily in a defensive maneuver, to keep
him away from the Cleveland Indians, and if the Yankees were to
trade for Finley and then allow him to leave as a free agent, they
would not receive draft picks as compensation, due to a clause in
Finley's existing contract.
</P>
<P>
   Teams can still trade after midnight Saturday, but making deals
will become far more problematic, as players must clear waivers.

CLEMENS' RED SOX RECORD CAN'T BE IGNORED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- If you're a Red Sox fan, it has become almost a ritual
when the New York Yankees come to town. You boo. And it doesn't
matter if they are in first place or last place. You let 'em have
it.
</P>
<P>
   But even that time-honored Fenway tradition will be tested
Saturday with the return of Roger Clemens in a role that even in
your worst nightmare, you never envisioned: Pitching for the
Yankees at Fenway Park. Hopefully, between the boos, there will be
a few cheers. For 13 seasons, he was the best the Red Sox ever
produced.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years Clemens played in Toronto, he went 21-7 (1997)
and 20-6 ('98) and won two Cy Young Awards, and he was booed at
Fenway. The Blue Jays were happy but Roger wasn't. We all know what
he wanted more than individual hardware . . . a championship ring.
Now, nothing would please him more than to make another down
payment on it. But he knows it won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the Yankees are good enough to get him to a World Series. A
year ago they walked away with the American League East with a
114-48 record. Boston made the playoffs as a wild-card entry, but
trailed by 22 games. This year's club came to town with a 61-39
record and a 6 1/2-game lead over the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say anything before this one,'' said Clemens
to several from Boston who tried to approach him.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee manager Joe Torre didn't mind speaking up. In 19 starts,
Clemens is 9-4 with a 4.67 earned run average. Clemens may not be
having the kind of year the man he replaced _ David Wells _ had
last season (the lefthander went 18-4 with a 3.49 ERA), but then
neither are the Yankees. And nobody expects 114 victories out of
the class of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about (Clemens's) ERA,'' said Torre Friday.
``I'm concerned how he's going to pitch. . . . He's throwing the
ball very well and he had a hell of a game Sunday at Cleveland. He
threw 135 pitches and left after seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's going to be a little strange when he goes out
there as it has been in the past when he's pitched here. He'll have
a tendency to walk to that first-base dugout. But he knows what
he's doing. ''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees know what they are doing. They are minus Wells,
Darryl Strawberry, Tim Raines, and Graeme Lloyd, to name a few from
last year's team. They have put newcomers such as Ricky Ledee and
Shane Spencer into active roles. Reliever Jeff Nelson is the most
notable injury, and the starting rotation has for the most part
stayed healthy. For inspiration, you only need to mention David
Cone. His perfect game against Montreal was a perfect lift. The
Yankees haven't been on a long steak this year. But they are 22
games above .500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team's all right,'' said Cone. ``We haven't played as well
as we think we're going to. Clemens is just getting going and
pitching well. I like our chances. We're past the point of worrying
about last year or the changes that have been made. We're at the
point now that we just want to get to the playoffs. We won't worry
about how many games we've won or are going to win . . . or what
trades have gone down or will go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons to the 1998 season still haunt the Yankees. That's
not fair, said Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was something that had never happened before in
baseball history,'' he said. ``We'll probably never see it again as
long as we're alive. We're playing better as of late. We're still
in first place. At times we've shown we can put everything together
and play well. But we haven't put it together for a long stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees can live with the boo-birds, he added. They are not
just a Boston invention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you play for the Yankees, regardless of your record,
teams want to beat you,'' said Jeter. ``More so if you win a
championship. You come to town and people want to beat the best
team in baseball. If you win a World Series, teams are going to gun
for you all that much more.''
</P>
<P>
   There in concern on Broadway about the Yankees. Trade winds are
blowing and one of the headliners, Andy Pettitte (7-8, 5.65), is
nearing the end of his run. Torre doesn't like the deals that are
being discussed. It makes him nervous when the name of reliever
Ramiro Mendoza comes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe we're not in any desperate shape to make a
deal,'' said Torre, ``unless it is a deal that we feel is going to
help us. I think we're fine the way we are. I do think there are
some areas in which we can improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could use a little speed. Our depth? We have Ledee,
Spencer. Chad Curtis to back up. A chance down the road that Darryl
Strawberry is there. We're in first place. That's our goal. We
can't worry about measuring up to last year.''
</P>
<P>
   But if a deal has to be made, it has to be made, he added.
Mendoza is too valuable to move. Pettitte is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let yourself get caught up in how you feel about
somebody,'' said Torre. ``Realistically, you have to say to
yourself what is best for the team. If Andy Pettitte were traded, I
would miss him. His stuff is good. He just needs a vacuum cleaner
inside that head to start over again mentally. If you start over,
you sort of build a foundation.''

BARRY MEYER, COO OF WARNER BROS., IS EXPECTED TO HEAD STUDIO

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Barry Meyer, the chief operating officer at the
Warner Bros. studio, is expected to be promoted to the top
position, company executives said Friday. He would succeed Robert
Daly and Terry Semel, who ran the film, television and music
divisions for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another insider, Alan Horn, chairman and chief
executive at Castle Rock Entertainment, has emerged as a top
candidate to run Warner's movie division, rival studio executives
and talent agents said. Horn is a friend and former associate of
Ted Turner, vice chairman and 11 percent owner of the studio's
parent company, Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A Warner Bros. spokeswoman, Barbara Brogliatti, said no
decisions had been made about replacements for Daly and Semel, who
unexpectedly announced their resignations two weeks ago after an
enduring and generally successful partnership. But one senior
Warner Bros. executive said Meyer would soon be appointed to a top
job at the studio.
</P>
<P>
   In making known their decision to leave, Daly and Semel, who
have grown enormously wealthy, said they wanted to join forces as
entertainment entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion of Meyer, a low-keyed and respected lawyer who was
third in the studio's corporate command behind Daly and Semel,
would set off ripples across a studio that has been the most stable
one in Hollywood for decades.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, Meyer is not expected to have the full leverage of
Daly and Semel, who ran the studio, including the troubled music
division, with relative independence from Time Warner. Both Meyer
and Horn are expected to be less free-wheeling than their
predecessors, who also served under Gerald M. Levin, chairman of
Time Warner, as well as Turner.
</P>
<P>
   At another level, Meyer's promotion is expected to mark the
close of a somewhat flamboyant era at the studio started by Steven
J. Ross, the charismatic Time Warner chairman who died in 1992.
Daly and Semel, who were trained and guided by Ross, made
big-budget, often successful films, especially in the 1980s, and
were accustomed to spending lavishly on movies, producer and star
deals and perquisites. This is expected to end in the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer and Horn did not respond to phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, 55, has worked on the business side of Warner Bros. for
28 years and has most recently overseen the company's television
production and distribution operations. He is also in charge of
legal affairs and strategic planning. A top talent agent said that
several senior Warner Bros. executives, responsible for such key
areas as the studio's stores and home video operations, had lobbied
for Meyer's promotion.
</P>
<P>
   A top Wall Street entertainment financier said Meyer was an
impressive, if little-known, figure, at the studio. ``He's done a
world-class job building Time Warner's television business, their
most successful business,'' the financier said. ``People on Wall
Street, and in the film business, don't really know him. He's very
mature and level-headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Once appointed, Meyer would face, along with Levin, an immediate
decision on how to deal with the struggling music group, which has
fallen to fourth place from first among the five biggest recording
companies in sales of current albums in the nation. This year,
Seagam's Universal Music Group, Sony and the Bertelsmann Music
Group have surpassed Warner Bros. in album sales. Warner Bros.
music has been struggling overseas, too.
</P>
<P>
   Several rival executives and talent agents said they expected
Levin to separate the music division and overhaul it. The music
unit has never quite recovered from the executive turmoil of the
mid-1990s when it was run first by Robert Morgado and then Michael
Fuchs, the former Home Box Office chairman. Daly and Semel took
over the music division in 1996, but it has floundered and
executives there have been criticized as out-of-touch with audience
tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Horn, 56, has had a mixed track record at Castle Rock, a
television and film division of Warner Bros.. Castle Rock's most
notable and biggest success by far was ``Seinfeld,'' whose nearly
200 episodes will run in syndication for years and will generate
perhaps $1.5 billion in revenue for Castle Rock. But the company
has fared poorly in movies, after a strong start with ``When Harry
Met Sally,'' ``City Slickers'' and ``Misery.'' Flops include
``Ghosts of Mississippi,'' ``An American President'' and ``Strip
Tease.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting, then owned by Turner, acquired Castle Rock
in 1993. After Time Warner acquired Turner in 1996, Castle Rock was
put up for sale by Levin, Daly and Semel. No buyers would pay the
price. So Castle Rock wound up as a division of Warner Bros.
studio.

AN INDEPENDENT HONG KONG EDITOR IS GIVEN HIS WALKING PAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ It had become a running gag in the newsroom of The
South China Morning Post. Whenever the paper's outspoken British
editor, Jonathan Fenby, told his staff that he was leaving town on
vacation, some smart aleck would pipe up, ``Are you coming back?''
</P>
<P>
   Fenby is off at the end of this week, but this time the joke
might catch in people's throats. After more than four years of
editing Hong Kong's leading English-language newspaper _ a tense
period during which this former British colony reverted to Chinese
rule _ Fenby has been handed his walking papers.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong is not like Fleet Street, where editors are
customarily dismissed in a blunt telephone call from the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Fenby, 56, said his bosses did not explain why they refused to
renew his contract, aside from vague suggestions that they wanted a
change. He has not even talked to the proprietor, Robert Kuok, a
Malaysian billionaire who bought control of The Post from Rupert
Murdoch in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be changes I'm not privy to,'' said Fenby, a
garrulous man who knows the vagaries of newspapering from stints at
The Independent, The Guardian and The Observer in Britain. ``But
obviously, the owners wanted people they could feel more
comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   The murky circumstances of Fenby's exit have prompted a rash of
speculation here that he is a victim of Hong Kong's tightening
political atmosphere. Under his editor's pen, The South China
Morning Post has been sharply critical of the Hong Kong government
_ most recently its decision to ask China to overrule an
immigration ruling by the territory's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly suspect this is motivated by his wanting to be more
independent than the owners are willing to be,'' said Margaret Ng,
a pro-democracy member of the Hong Kong Legislature. ``As a whole,
newspapers have become steadily more pro-government since the
handover.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuok, whose company owns 34 percent of the shares of the Post,
declined to comment on the reason for Fenby's departure, as did
Owen Jonathan, the newspaper's chief executive. But Jonathan said
it was not related to The Post's news coverage, adding, ``Editors
do come, and they do go.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hong Kong still has more than a dozen daily newspapers,
which engage in roisterous competition, they tend to fall in line
behind the government on the most critical issues, such as
overturning the ruling, which would have given over 1 million
mainland Chinese the right to live here.
</P>
<P>
   The Post was almost alone in opposing that move. In an editorial
published the day after Beijing overturned the ruling, Fenby wrote
that Hong Kong had eroded the rule of law _ the bedrock of its
commercial success _ by politicizing its judiciary and humiliating
its highest court.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh words angered the government, which took the highly
unusual step of dispatching its No. 2 official, Anson Chan, to
speak to Fenby. Although a spokesman said the government would
never try to bully the paper, one senior official said The Post
``ought to recognize its responsibility as the paper people outside
Hong Kong read to learn about things here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fenby said, ``There's been a much stronger reaction to the
newspaper, from officialdom, from business circles, from members of
the establishment, than at any time since the handover.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure from mainland China is mounting as well. Earlier this
month, a senior Chinese official told a group of Hong Kong
journalists visiting Beijing that ``some people, including some
newspapers, have fueled the row and caused all the controversy.''
It was the first time since the handover that a mainland official
had criticized news coverage in Hong Kong. And to Fenby, it was an
unmistakable sign that Beijing has The Post in its cross hairs.
</P>
<P>
   For all the heat, Fenby said he had not been asked by Kuok or
the newspaper's executives to tone down The Post's coverage of the
immigration issue. At other times in the last four years, however,
Fenby said he had to fend off efforts by Kuok's deputies to
influence coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the handover, Fenby said he received a directive
to refer to the 1989 military crackdown in Tiananmen Square as an
``incident'' _ the word customarily used by Beijing _ rather than a
``massacre.'' He briefly considered resigning over the issue. But
he then decided to leave it up to his reporters to decide which
word to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `massacre' disappeared from the paper for a couple of
months, and I still perceive that the editors are sensitive about
using it in headlines,'' said Gren Manuel, an investigative
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Kuok brought in a prominent Chinese
journalist, Feng Xiliang, one of the founding editors of China's
official English-language paper, China Daily. Reporters promptly
dubbed him the ``political commissar.'' Again, Fenby contemplated
leaving. But instead he decided to marginalize Feng, who ended up
with little influence and is now rarely seen in the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of last year, though, it was Fenby who was in
danger of being shunted to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Kuok brought in Robert Keatley, a longtime editor at The Wall
Street Journal, ostensibly to bring ``a touch of The Wall Street
Journal'' by encouraging more analytical reporting, as Keatley puts
it. Fenby wondered whether the paper was laying the groundwork for
his departure.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears proved warranted. In May, Keatley was named to
replace Fenby _ at least for the time being. Keatley, 64, said the
paper was searching for a more long-term replacement. Several
reporters said Kuok would like to put a Chinese journalist in the
top job. Jonathan said race was not a factor, though it would be an
advantage if the new editor spoke Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Keatley denied that Fenby had been pushed out
because of political considerations. And he pledged to maintain The
Post's editorial stance on legal issues and Hong Kong's autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do come out of The Wall Street Journal,'' he said. ``It
stands for human rights and the rule of law.''

   PITTSFIELD, Mass. _ Here in the sprawling Price Chopper
supermarket, between Aisle 6, devoted to detergents and dog food,
and Aisle 9, the home of peanut butter and jelly, Roger A. Enrico's
vision of the future is on display.
</P>
<P>
   Enrico is the chairman of Pepsico. In April, store workers and
Pepsi sales representatives tore apart Aisles 7 and 8, creating a
large space stocked with mostly Pepsi soft drinks and Frito-Lay
snack food. With an inflatable Star Wars pod racer dangling from
the ceiling, and large color photographs of adults and children
tucking into Pepsi products, the ``Power Aisle'' is hard to miss.
Pepsi hopes shoppers looking for a two-liter bottle of Mountain Dew
will grab a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos as well, or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of the company's marketing strategy known as the
Power of One, a New Age-sounding slogan for selling soda and snack
food together and maybe Pepsi's other core product _ fruit juice _
too.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, of course, is to pump up Pepsi's sales and profits by
taking advantage of some synergies unavailable to its rival, Coke,
and thereby boost its lagging share price.
</P>
<P>
   The Power of One doesn't just involve physically stacking
12-packs of Pepsi next to nacho cheese Wow Doritos (Enrico's
favorite) on one side and calcium-fortified Tropicana orange juice
on the other.
</P>
<P>
   It also means touting the combined profit potential of Pepsi's
array of products to supermarket managers in negotiations for
precious shelf space. And it means fortifying those deals with
Pepsi-paid promotions that will translate into tidy profits for the
stores.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has been kicking around Pepsico's divisions for years
now. In fact, displaying salty products next to thirst-quenchers is
so obvious that some regional managers have been pushing the
practice for a long time. But in the last few months, with the
appointment of a senior marketing executive to oversee it, the
concept has truly caught fire inside the company.
</P>
<P>
   One reason executives like it so much is that it plays to a
Pepsi strength _ product diversity _ that Coke, with its exclusive
focus on soft drinks, has no immediate hope of matching.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that the consolidation of the food industry in recent
years has reduced the number of big supermarket chains to half a
dozen from 20, meaning that selling just one major customer on the
Power of One could result in a huge boost to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today five customers will do 44 percent of our supermarket
business,'' said Al Carey, a senior vice president at Pepsico whom
Enrico named last year to oversee the strategy. ``What ends up
happening is that you have a more demanding customer, and a
customer who wants things they don't have, in terms of data mining,
category management, and telling them which promotions are
successful and which are not.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Pepsi hopes to become more or less married to
its major retail customers _ helping them sell Pepsi products,
using techniques that Pepsi will develop and pay for. Enrico even
dreams about stationing Pepsico employees full time in some big
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have a person from Pepsico who is there all day,'' he
said enthusiastically in an interview last month, looking tanned
and fit after a summer weekend in Montana. ``That person would
order the Frito-Lay products, as well as Pepsi and Tropicana
products, schedule the deliveries, do the merchandising and the
in-store category management.''
</P>
<P>
   And would store managers be happy about such outsiders coming in
and poking around their aisles? Of course they would, Enrico said.
``Anything we can do with these large and profitable categories for
retailers has tremendous leverage effect on a retailer's bottom
line,'' he said. Why, when he mentions putting a Pepsico employee
in a store full time to supermarket executives, he declared,
``their eyes light up _ they just love this.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some of them do. Others don't sound totally sold on the
idea. Even Price Chopper, which let Pepsi loose in its store here,
has some reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pepsi's sales grow at the expense of Coke's, then I've
gained nothing,'' said Jim Mizeur, a vice president at Price
Chopper's Schenectady, N.Y., headquarters. Besides, he added, ``If
Pepsi does it, do you do it with your Budweiser guy and your
Campbell's guy?''
</P>
<P>
   But if there is a tangible advantage for the store, then Mizeur
said he would not rule out such collaboration. ``The position we
take is if it grows the category, then we're in favor of it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a condition is music to Pepsi's ears. In stores where the
company has run trials, Enrico said, sales of Frito-Lay products
rose 21 percent, and sales of soft drinks _ all kinds, not just
Pepsi's _ increased, though not as much. People who have both salty
snacks and soft drinks in their homes, he noted, tend to consume
them together; the Power of One program is supposed to reinforce
what he already considers ``fundamental consumer behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have become believers as well. Bill Pecoriello,
who covers Pepsico and other beverage companies for Sanford C.
Bernstein, says the strategy should help Pepsi move more soft
drinks and snacks out the door. ``We're convinced that it's a good
idea,'' he said. ``The question is, why didn't they do this 30
years ago?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The strategy's current prominence goes back to Pepsico's
decision in 1996 to cast off its peripheral businesses and
concentrate on drinks and snacks. First, it spun off its restaurant
division. Then, Enrico pounced on Tropicana, paying $3.3 billion to
acquire it last summer from Seagram. Finally, Pepsi made its
bottling division into a separate, publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   Retail experts generally think the company is on the right
track. ``In this day of precious shelf space and the desire of all
retailers to cut product costs, I would think they would be
amenable to the idea at least, if it meant a savings to them and if
there were heavy promotional dollars behind it,'' said Paul
Bernish, a former supermarket executive who now runs a consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he added, ``There are a lot of suppliers who
are trying similar things.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics note that Pepsi can only fight for shelf space, not own
it. Even the Power Aisle here displays Rubbermaid plastic pitchers
and jugs of fruit-flavored wine in addition to Pepsi products. And
a big island of Coca-Cola 12-packs appeared recently, on sale for
$1.98. Considering the aisle is meant to display all kinds of soft
drinks, the Coke space is logical, but probably not what the Pepsi
designers had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   There may be more of that in store from Coke, which dwarfs Pepsi
in the $56 billion carbonated soft-drink business with 45 percent
of the market, vs. 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the largest account for Coke in this area,'' said the
store's grocery manager, Jim Collins, adding that when the Power
Aisle opened up, ``Coke wasn't happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke executives have been trooping in to see it, he added, and
he expects the company will come up with some competing version
before long.
</P>
<P>
   Coke has already begun to fire back with some in-store programs
of its own, said Polly Howes, a spokeswoman for the company. These
include a plan that offers shoppers Cokes as they walk into stores
(they have to pay for them on their way out, of course) and a red
``cart caddy'' that hooks onto shopping carts and includes a bottle
holder. Coke also has begun to promote its products with DiGiorno
pizza, Oreo cookies and other foods, all designed to increase sales
across the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the soft-drink category in and of itself is a
great profit generator for retailers,'' Ms. Howes said. ``And
consumers have been telling us for years that they link Coca-Cola
with all kinds of foods.'' In other words, not just potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the market seems to regard the Power of One as a
98-pound weakling when it comes to lifting Pepsi's share price.
With a price-earnings multiple of 30, compared with 47 for
Coca-Cola, Pepsi is hardly one of Wall Street's darlings, despite
its elaborate makeover.
</P>
<P>
   And investors bolted from Pepsico stock in late March after
Coke, not Pepsi, revealed that it was having a terrible quarter, a
fallout that Enrico finds puzzling since soft drinks account for
less than half of Pepsi's profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue with the share price is convincing investors
that they can deliver consistent 12 percent to 13 percent earnings
growth,'' said Pecoriello, the Wall Street analyst. ``Power of One
is one component of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Enrico has been basking in grocery-store scanner data
that show Pepsi growing faster than Coke (though at the same time
sales of the company's heavily promoted Wow chips are falling). And
he insists Pepsi stock will jump once the company shows growth
across several quarters. The company showed solid results in nearly
every operating group in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pepsico has moved from being a conglomerate to being an
operating company,'' Enrico said. ``We had a slightly decentralized
culture here, and that's one of the changes we've made. We don't
try to run the businesses from here, but we do try to work with
them to set the strategic agenda from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Enrico's biggest fear seems to be unrolling the program too
fast, forcing too much change on subordinates long accustomed to
working independently. What would be bad, he said, was if ``somehow
we pushed the pendulum too far on Power of One, and the divisions
don't drive their own agendas optimally, or if people lose their
sense of ownership over the end result.''
</P>
<P>
   The separate fiefdoms that made up Pepsico for years have not
exactly disappeared from the scene, and the risk remains that they
will resist pulling together toward the same objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same time, some inside Pepsico have complained that
the program isn't moving fast enough. ``I get criticized
internally, `Why aren't we moving on this?''' he said. ``My answer
is, this is of such strategic consequence, I don't want it to get
lost.''

CROPS, AND JOBS, DRYING UP IN LONG, HOT SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Spelling of `Maire' in 14th graf is correct.) 
(yn) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRING VALLEY, N.Y. _ Every morning, Magdaleno Fuentes waits by
the shoulder of Route 59, hoping to find a job mowing lawns,
trimming bushes or planting bushes. Eager to impress, he wears his
best button-down shirt and clutches a plastic bag hiding a
sleeveless gray T-shirt, specked with the toil and soil from
previous jobs. Usually, he waits for a few minutes, a couple of
hours at most, before the right job comes along.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, Fuentes is waiting a lot more. It has been two
weeks, in fact, since he last found work, and it may be another
week or more, he worries, before he and other day laborers in
Rockland County are able to find steady work. The reason, he says,
is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``No rain, no work,'' said Fuentes, 39, a native of Puebla,
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For all the complaints and misery swirling around the effects of
the dry weather and subsequent water restrictions on verdant lawns,
the quieter reality is that the restrictions are also having a
ripple effect on anyone who depends on rain to eke out a living.
</P>
<P>
   For farmers, no rain means that the life has been sucked out of
cornfields and fruit trees. For landscapers, no rain means
mandatory water limits that have almost forced them to cease
operating _ and stop hiring day laborers like Fuentes. Unless there
is a change in the weather soon, no rain also means that life
promises to become more dire for more people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a trickle-down effect, because if these people don't make
money, they affect our local economy,'' said Mayor Allan Thompson
of Spring Valley. ``It's hurting everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, many farmers are calling this summer the hottest and
driest in recent memory. In the entire eastern United States,
rainfall in June and July has been the lowest in more than a
decade, according to the National Weather Service. And the impact
is being felt across the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the effects on everything from fields to orchards
to nurseries,'' said Sharon M. Douglas, a plant pathologist at the
Connecticut Agricultural Station, a state agency in New Haven.
``People are trying to get as much water on their crops as
possible, but some growers have pumped their ponds dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Wood, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Agriculture
Department, said the arid weather was having a devastating impact
on corn, alfalfa and soybean crops and that Gov. Christine Todd
Whitman was preparing to ask the federal government to declare the
state's farmland a disaster area, making farmers eligible for
low-interest loans. In addition the state is expected to impose
voluntary limits on water use next week. Already mandatory
restrictions are in place in all of Rockland County and in many
municipalities in Orange County. On July 13, Rockland County, which
draws all its water from within its geographic boundaries, imposed
Stage 1 water emergency restrictions, curbing the watering of lawns
to every other day. But when officials discovered that people
simply watered nonstop on the designated day, causing usage to
actually inch up, the county imposed a Stage 2 emergency on July
21, forbidding the use of lawn sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   Violators are first warned and informed of the maximum penalty
of $1,000 a day, said Tom Micelli, the county's acting health
commissioner. And so far, at least, the message has filtered
through: daily water usage has dropped from an average of 42
million gallons to 32 million gallons, said Terri Guess, a
spokeswoman for United Water, which provides water to most of
Rockland County.
</P>
<P>
   But still, there has been hardly any rain in the region, and
little prospect for relief in the coming days, according to the
Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even when there has been rain, it has usually been of the
cloudburst variety. On Thursday night, for instance, a brief shower
dumped up to three inches in some parts of Orange County. But that
was of little use, because the soil did not have time to soak it
up.
</P>
<P>
   What is more desirable, said Maire Ullrich, vegetable crops
agent for the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Orange and Ulster
Counties, is Seattlelike weather for a week: a good, but not
overwhelming, soaking of a couple of inches a day, for four to
seven straight days.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other meteorological calamity, there's not much to
blame here but fate. But in Rockland County, officials and the
public have found a target for at least some of their anger: New
Jersey. United Water, the utility that serves Rockland and parts of
New Jersey, is entitled to channel more water from a Rockland
reservoir to New Jersey if water levels there fall too low. Even
though that hasn't happened, some people in Rockland, where water
use is restricted, are unhappy that United is pumping any water to
New Jersey, where there are no restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you're standing on this side of Rockland County, and
the grass looks like weed, and in New Jersey,'' said C. Scott
Vanderhoef, the Rockland County executive, with a hint of outrage
in his voice, ``the grass looks plush.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is still too early to quantify the impact the dry weather has
had on local landscaping _ a $250 million-a-year business _ or on
local farmers, officials say. But there have been plenty of
anecdotes about the ruinous and near-ruinous repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   In Orange County, onion farmers have been staring at dusty,
desertlike soil and poor yields. ``The farmers are in trouble,''
said Matthias Schliefer, the assistant commissioner for
environmental health of Orange County. ``Our onion-growing country
is just about a total disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Corn fields have been devastated, too, with some farmers
reporting damage to 50, 60 or even 80 percent of their crops. At
the Fort Hill Farm in the Orange County community of Goshen,
Claudia and Phil Johnson have watched helplessly as about 400 acres
of corn have withered in the oppressive heat. That corn was
supposed to be used as feed for their 300-head dairy farm; now,
instead, the Johnsons, sixth-generation farmers, will have to buy
feed.
</P>
<P>
   In New City, in Rockland County, Jim Cropsey, whose family has
owned Cropsey Farms since 1893, has watched his 40 acres of corn
wilt, turning what should have been a lush, green plain of
10-foot-high stalks into a yellow, even singed-looking field of
half-sized corn. On Thursday, for instance, his workers picked 23
bags of corn; during a normal summer with rain, that figure is up
to 125 bags a day.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The pumpkin fields are so dry and dusty, Cropsey said, that his
workers may have to wear masks when they work the fields. His snap
peas do not snap; they look limp. And some of his peaches have been
utterly useless, puny things that resemble golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember as dry a summer as this,'' said Cropsey, a
robust 70-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So far, Cropsey and other farmers have been forced to lay off,
or at least not hire, day laborers to work their fields. There are
easily hundreds of day laborers in Rockland County, mainly from
Latin America, who look for work, have families to support and
generally live in substandard conditions anyway, said Patricia
Feeley, executive director of Catholic Community Services of
Rockland.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be particularly trying in the next few days, she
said, as the rent comes due on the first of the month and food
becomes scarce. ``We're going to see tremendous suffering,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At Lucrezia's Nursery in Spring Valley, home to lush weeping
Norway spruces, thundercloud purple leaf plums, and Japanese
weeping cherries, hardly anyone stops by anymore because no one
wants to buy something they will not be able to water, said Rosa
Lucrezia, who with her husband owns the nursery.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, for instance, one person visited the nursery.
It turned out to be an advertising salesman for a local newspaper.
And usually, Mrs. Lucrezia takes out a monthly ad. But this time,
she said, it would be of no use _ not until it rains again, anyway.

HOUSTON MAN GAINS GUARDIANSHIP OVER COMATOSE WOMAN, FETUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Houston hospital, ordered last week to do everything
possible to keep a comatose woman and her 16-week-old fetus alive,
claims it does not have to try to save the fetus if the woman is
declared brain-dead.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Law, 35, of Houston was named Tammy Martin's temporary
guardian Friday after he presented a hospital attorney's letter
saying the court-ordered life support would be ``inapplicable'' if
Martin, 34, is ruled brain-dead.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County Probate Judge Rory Olsen's ruling means Memorial
Hospital Northwest must seek Law's permission before performing any
medical treatment on Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Law, who says he is Martin's common-law husband and father of
the fetus, wants her kept on life support _ even if she is ruled
brain-dead _ to try to save the fetus, whose heart is still
beating.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's parents want her and the fetus to be allowed to die,
and Law believes the hospital is doing everything it can to bring
this end about.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's family says her guardian has been her mother, Joyce
Cox, 60, of Brackettville in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital attorneys were not present at Friday's hearing, and
spokeswoman Patty Riddlebarger said she could not comment because
of patient confidentiality rules.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen named Law as temporary guardian until Sept. 28, and
scheduled another hearing for Aug. 13 to determine whether the
guardianship needed to be continued. The temporary order does not
allow Law to authorize termination of life support.
</P>
<P>
   Law and his attorney, Michael Stanley, declined to comment. But
in court papers filed Friday, Law said Martin and the fetus
``should be protected from a physician of the hospital's choice,
which has shown by its conduct its hostility to (Law's) efforts to
preserve and protect the lives of his wife and child.''
</P>
<P>
   The papers also claim Martin is showing ``increased activity
when spoken to in the presence of (Law).''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's brother, Lonnie, 40, of nearby Splendora, said he
learned about the latest legal maneuver from a reporter and that
his parents, J.D. and Joyce Cox, had not heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they gave him temporary guardianship,'' Martin
said. ``We believe the baby should go to heaven with her mama.''
</P>
<P>
   Law was granted a two-week temporary restraining order July 23 _
five days after Martin became comatose from a blow to the head _
telling the hospital to do everything possible to keep her and the
fetus alive.
</P>
<P>
   In that order, state District Judge Scott Link said the hospital
was restrained ``from withholding treatment necessary to keep Tammy
Martin and her unborn child alive and from in any way facilitating
or expediting the death of Tammy Martin and Mr. Law's unborn
child.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital has apparently interpreted the order to mean it
does not have to keep the fetus alive if Martin is ruled
brain-dead.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated Wednesday, hospital attorney Gregory Sapire
said Link's order ``would be inapplicable if Tammy Martin were
found to have lost all spontaneous brain function.''
</P>
<P>
   Link's order would have lasted until Aug. 5, when a hearing is
scheduled on Law's request to be declared Martin's common-law
husband. But the order could presumably have been extended.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tammy Martin did not specify if she should be kept alive
by artificial means if she was ruled terminally ill, state law
allows a ``surrogate decision-maker'' to make that determination.
</P>
<P>
   If Law is declared Martin's common-law husband, he would have
top priority in making such a decision. Currently, Martin's mother
has that authority, family members have said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sapire's letter said Martin has not officially been
ruled brain-dead, Lonnie Martin has said that doctors told him
twice last week that they believe she is. He said a test that could
make an official determination was scheduled for last week but was
put off until at least Aug. 5 for ``legal reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Riddlebarger has said the test has not been done for ``medical
reasons.'' Called an apnea test, it measures the brain's ability to
produce a breathing response when ventilating machines are turned
off.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's family claims Law is not her common-law husband and may
be criminally responsible for her death. There is no point to keep
her on life support if she is ruled brain-dead, the family said,
because she was an alcoholic and used cocaine. The family believes
the fetus will have little chance of being healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's former boy friend, Ben Bruce of Houston, has said he
plans to file court papers claiming to be her common-law husband.
The family has said Bruce may even be the father of the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Law says Martin hit her head on a car door and fell unconscious
several hours later. Even if she is ruled brain-dead, he says, she
should be kept on life support at least until the fetus is old
enough to be taken out, between 23-28 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was facing two years in prison for violating probation
after pleading guilty to recklessly injuring a minor. She had been
charged with injecting cocaine and amphetamines into Bruce's minor
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Martin claims Bruce told him that Tammy Martin became
pregnant to try to avoid prison time, and wanted to get an abortion
after she realized it would have no bearing on her sentence. Law
says the story is a lie and that Tammy Martin would have wanted to
give the fetus a chance to live.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ How hot is it?
</P>
<P>
   At the Willow Restaurant and Bar, the white cloths on the
outdoor tables do not have to be changed after the lunch rush,
because everybody sits inside. Alex Carrera, a letter carrier,
spent $48 of his own money to put a fan in the lobby of 110
Riverside Drive, where he delivers mail to 96 apartments. Mary
Cantazaro of Bensonhurst offered to take a friend dinner as a ruse
to get into her air-conditioned apartment. Midweek movie matinees
are selling out.
</P>
<P>
   And every afternoon after his walk, Bertram, an English bulldog,
hops into the tub in his owner's Upper East Side apartment and
waits for a cold shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't require long walks in this heat,'' Margaret Hogg,
who walks five dogs daily, explained as she fed Bertram water from
a Gatorade bottle on a bench in Central Park. ``They seem like we
do, no energy in this heat. It drains them.''
</P>
<P>
   As the hottest July on record comes to a close here, it almost
seems as though summer fun in New York City has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   People are walking slower, eating less and drinking more. They
are canceling plans to go to the park, the zoo, even the beach.
They are staying home. And, this being New York, they are
complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Summer in the city is supposed to be a celebration of sidewalk
cafes and Shakespeare in the Park, of bicycle rides, barbecues and
botanical gardens. Instead, it has become the season of sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We waited for the summer all year, for six months, and then
look at this,'' Maria Rodriguez said as she poured her 4-year-old
grandson a cup of cold Kool-Aid while waiting at a public pool for
the lifeguards to come back from their lunch break. ``I want it to
get cool already.''
</P>
<P>
   How hot is it?
</P>
<P>
   Not counting Friday or Saturday, the average temperature for the
month has been 81.3 degrees. That includes nighttime. There have
been 17 days over 90 and 11 days over 95. The forecast for Saturday
is a sultry 96. July 1995, which previously held the record for the
hottest month, had an average temperature of 80.9 and only 14 days
above 90 degrees, nine above 95.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, there have been 91 deaths linked to the heat in 17
states since July 19. The Midwest, where brick buildings seemed
like baking ovens yesterday, has been hardest hit, with 29
heat-related deaths during the past 10 days in Missouri, 23 in
Illinois and 10 in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The heat index, which factors in humidity, was 120 in Chicago
yesterday, according to the National Weather Service. The
temperature alone hit 104 degrees in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the mercury has not spiked up past 100 since the
Independence Day weekend, with its disastrous blackout for about
200,000 customers in Washington Heights and the Lower East Side.
But the relentless heat and humidity, day after day after day of
summer swelter, is what has everybody dragging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as ambitious,'' admitted Tommy King, a waiter at the
Willow, a bistro at 73rd Street and Lexington Avenue. Trying to
make fewer trips in and out of the kitchen, King waits until
multiple orders are ready before bringing them to the table. ``If I
have a table outside,'' he added, ``they won't get as good
service.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any energy,'' King said. ``Even to read. There's
nothing I really desire to do, and I certainly don't do any cooking
or cleaning. My apartment is so sloppy.''
</P>
<P>
   It could, of course, be worse.
</P>
<P>
   He could be the dry-cleaning delivery guy, tromping through the
streets with closetfulls of clothes in their sticky plastic wraps.
Or Cesar Diaz, who plays violin on the subway platform at 79th and
Broadway and depends on the hot wind the trains make as they come
and go and a burst of cold each time the doors to the
air-conditioned cars open. Or Eddie Ayala, the air-conditioning
repairman who has to ride around the city in an non-air-conditioned
van.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get nasty,'' Ayala said of the customers he sees each
day. ``They blame me for the air-conditioning not working when I
haven't even been there.''
</P>
<P>
   How hot is it?
</P>
<P>
   There were 32 heat-related deaths in New York from July 3 to
July 28, with victims ages 27 to 102 (half were over 65). Dr.
Joshua Stillman, the assistant director of emergency services at
Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, said there have been about 50 extra
patients a day with heat-related problems ranging from food
poisoning to dizziness that resulted in a person breaking a leg.
</P>
<P>
   And Marlin S. Potash, a psychotherapist, said she can sense a
kind of mental heat stroke in the workaholics who make up her Upper
East Side practice. Slowing down is uncomfortable for her revved-up
clients, Potash said, and ``they feel like they're losing out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's, `Everybody else is in the country and I have to
work,' or `My air-conditioner went out,' or `I was planning to
learn how to play tennis but it's so hot I can't bear to,''' Potash
said, ``There's this sense that the summer is getting away from you
without doing the things you look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, yesterday, Matthew Kelly took his 4-year-old son, Jake,
to the Children's Museum _ where attendance is nearly 25 percent
higher than it was last July _ instead of to the playground. James
Mott, 54, of Sunnyside, Queens, was headed for the biodiversity
exhibit at the Museum of Natural History (which has had an 8
percent jump in visitors) rather than on the ferry to Fire Island.
Kathy Owl, a registered nurse who is training for the Chicago
marathon in the fall, stopped running after a mile and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in Houston,'' said Ms. Owl, who is visiting a friend
for the weekend, as she left Central Park about 9 a.m. in a tank
top soaked with sweat. ``So this is about the same.''
</P>
<P>
   But Houston is built for this. People in Houston go from
air-conditioned homes to air-conditioned cars to air-conditioned
offices. They have underground, air-conditioned tunnels connecting
them to malls and food courts. They wear stockings in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   New York is the land of sidewalk sightseeing, and these days,
everybody is crowding the shady side.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge, for many, is figuring out what to do with
children, who cannot be satisfied with simply collapsing on the
couch.
</P>
<P>
   At Public School 282 in Park Slope, teachers read to students in
the office, which is the only room with air-conditioning. At Girl
Scout Camp Waneeshi in Dutchess County, counselors are telling
campers to wrap wet bandanas around their necks. In East Harlem,
Rajalar Price has turned day care at A Learning Center into a quest
for water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to the sprinklers every day _ any sprinklers we can
find,'' Price, 36, said as he led 16 charges, ages 4 to 12, up the
steps to the Central Park pool. ``We have a really good time
getting in the water. Wherever we can find it, we get in it.''
</P>
<P>
   How hot is it?
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask Sal Ruggeri.
</P>
<P>
   Ruggeri, who has spent two decades driving horse-drawn carriages
around Central Park, is not just upset at the income he has lost
because the horses have been sidelined for 25 days so far this
summer, more than twice the norm. He is also ornery because of the
endless stream of news reporters stopping for heat stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday there was a guy here who must have taken 50 pictures
of me,'' said Ruggeri, declining to be photographed. ``Today, they
tell me I'm on the Internet, also. It's getting to be annoying,
really.''

   SENATE VOTES TO CUT TAXES BY $792 BILLION IN 10 YEARS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted to cut taxes by $792 billion over the next 10
years, moving the Republican-controlled Congress toward a showdown
with President Clinton over how the nation can best use trillions
of dollars in projected federal budget surpluses. The vote was
57-43. Four Democrats joined 53 Republicans in support of the bill,
while two Republicans and 41 Democrats voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would cut personal income taxes by reducing the lowest
tax rate starting in 2001. It would give a tax break to many
married couples, expand the Individual Retirement Account program,
create a deduction for some health insurance costs and reduce the
inheritance tax on large estates.
</P>
<P>
   DOW JONES AVERAGE FALLS 136 POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Stocks declined as more evidence of inflation pressures
convinced investors the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates
soon. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 136.14 points, or
1.26 percent, to 10,655.15, after sliding 180.78 points Thursday.
For the week, the blue-chip index was down 255.81 points. The
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 1.52 points, to
2,638.49, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks
declined 12.31 points, to 1,328.72.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bond prices dropped, rounding out the sixth consecutive
losing month for Treasuries. The decline was spurred by reports on
housing, manufacturing and personal income that added to concern
the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates soon. The yield on
the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.10 percent from 6.07 percent on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL INCOME INCREASED IN JUNE
</P>
<P>
   Personal income, which includes wages, interest and government
benefits, rose seven-tenths of a percent, faster than expected, in
June. It marked the first time since January that personal income
outpaced the rise in spending. In a separate report, the government
said that new home sales jumped 3.1 percent as buyers rushed to
beat rising mortgage rates. Sales of new single-family homes rose
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 929,000 units, better than
forecast.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA EXCHANGE REAPPOINTS
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Stock Exchange reappointed Meyer Frucher, its
chairman, for two years, despite some opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL END DISPUTE
</P>
<P>
   Argentina has retreated from a threat to impose punitive tariffs
on Brazilian exports, easing a dispute between the two countries
that had threatened the cohesion of the $1.1 trillion MERCOSUR
trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
   A MERGER OF BRITISH NEWSPAPERS
</P>
<P>
   Trinity, Britain's largest regional newspaper company, plans to
buy the Mirror Group for (PS)1.24 billion, or about $2 billion. The
deal would create the largest newspaper publisher in Britain,
combining local newspapers like The Liverpool Echo with The Mirror.
Trinity's chief executive, Philip Graf, will head the new group.
</P>
<P>
   HEAD OF CHINA EVERBRIGHT RESIGNS
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of China Everbright Group, one of that nation's

deputy governor of the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL TRUCKERS HALT STRIKE
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government reached a deal to end a strike that had
paralyzed road transport. Federal authorities agreed to suspend an
increase in diesel prices, freeze tolls on some highways and send
Congress a proposal that would penalize truckers less than other
motorists for traffic violations.

 &HT;    A day of mayhem in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa, Mark Bixler
 &HT;    and Brad Schrade
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before he killed his wife with a hammer...Before he
murdered his sleeping children...Before he went on a shooting spree
that killed nine people and injured 12... Mark Barton put on a
Scout uniform to take his son to a troop meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tuesday afternoon at the Bristol Green apartments in
Stockbridge, and Travis Holmes, 14, saw Barton and his son and
struck up a conversation with them. Travis is a Scout, so everyone
had something in common. They talked about merit badges. They
talked about camp.
</P>
<P>
   Travis saw no signs that Barton was about to take the first
steps on a terrifying journey that would devestate families,
challenge a city's sense of security and rivet the nation with its
intimate brutality and horrific randomness.
</P>
<P>
   But another person who saw him Tuesday noticed that something
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   `Something's weird'
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's weird about this man,'' Marsha Jean DeFreese
remembers thinking when Barton, a troop leader, came to pick up her
grandsonwho was friends with Barton's son.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. DeFreese had lived near the family last year in the Atlanta
suburb of Morrow, before Barton split with his second wife, Leigh
Ann. Mrs. Barton had moved Matthew and his 7-year-old sister
Elizabeth Mychelle to a Stockbridge apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Mrs. DeFreese recalled, Barton would not return with
the boys until 11 p.m., which she thought was strange. She chalked
it up to their closeness.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way for Travis to know on Tuesday afternoon that he
was chatting with a man who, by his own admission, was consumed
with hatred. Or that Mark Barton would cause so much anguish and
grief in the next three days, Barton's last three days on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the ordinary conversation about Scouts, however,
Barton killed his wife with a hammer and stuffed her body in a
bedroom closet. The next morning and afternoon, Barton stayed in
the apartment with his 11-year-old Matthew, and his daughter,
8-year-old Mychelle, said Capt. Jim Simmons of the Henry County
Police Department. On Wednesday night, Barton smashed the hammer
into his children and then held them down in a bathtub to make sure
they were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said he tidied up, put the kids back in bed and
tucked them in. They said he left a video game on Matthew's body
and a stuffed toy on Mychelle's body. Now he was alone in an
apartment with three bodies. He booted up a home computer and
started typing a note for the police. He addressed it ``To Whom It
May Concern'' and dated it Thursday, July 29, at 6:38 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan to live very much longer,'' he said, ``just long
enough to kill as many of the people that greedily sought my
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading day got worse
</P>
<P>
   About eight hours later, just before 2:30 p.m. Thursday, Barton
strolled into the offices of Momentum Securities Inc., a
day-trading firm on the third floor of a Buckhead office building.
It's a place where people sit in front of computers to gamble on
the stock market, hoping for instant gains.
</P>
<P>
   He had traded many times before in this office and was known to
the people who worked there.
</P>
<P>
   They exchanged pleasantries. Barton told them he wanted to make
a few transactions.
</P>
<P>
   He chatted for a minute or two longer.
</P>
<P>
   Police later said he made a chilling remark:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad trading day and it's about to get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Barton whipped out two pistols.
</P>
<P>
   ``He then shot both guns at the same time, `` Atlanta Police
Chief Beverly Harvard said Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt begins
</P>
<P>
   Police got the first call about the gunfire at Momentum's third
floor office at 2:56 p.m. A woman told 911 dispatchers that a man
had come into the office and shot people. Two minutes later, at
2:58 p.m., a man sounding more urgent told police four people were
dead at Momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The first Atlanta police officer arrived at the office at 3
p.m., Harvard said. Blood was everywhere. A thick trail snaked
around the third floor hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was immediately told that four people were dead and he went
up to Suite 310,'' Harvard said. ``He called for back-up and other
officers arrived within seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   As the officers began canvassing the office, stepping carefully
over the victims, they heard voices coming from a smaller room just
a few feet from where the slain victims lay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers found several people huddled in the smaller room,
they had gone in there to hide,'' Harvard said. ``One of the people
had thrown a computer out the window to attract the attrention of
someone on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the women in the room shouted out, 'Mark Barton shot
us!' ``
</P>
<P>
   While the cops began combing through the other offices on the
third floor, another officer circled his motorcycle on Piedmont
Road below. Suddeny shots rang out at a complex of other office
building across the street.
</P>
<P>
   It was 3:07 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Bodies are everywhere
</P>
<P>
   Other officers arrived and were told the shots were coming from
Suite 215 in building eight of the Piedmont Center, an office
complex made up of 11 buildings. A security guard from Barton
Protective Services, Inc., _ the company is not related to Barton _
told officers they heard several shots.
</P>
<P>
   The officers went inside and saw five people slumped over their
computer terminals. Several others were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Barton is missing
</P>
<P>
   It was 3:15 p.m. Barton was nowhere in sight and the officers
began their thorough search for the shooter throughout Piedmont
Center. Ambulances flooded Piedmont Road.
</P>
<P>
   Even the seasoned paramedics who patrol Atlanta's toughest
neighborhoods said they'd never seen anything like the carnage at
two Buckhead offices where nine were slain Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dispatchers had alerted medical personnel to expect several
victims, both dead and wounded. But paramedics said what they found
was far worse than what they had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see shootings all the time, they almost seen routine,''
said Reginald McCoy, a paramedic with Grady Memorial Hospital.
``But I've never seen anything like that ... the volume. It was
utter chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 20 miles south of downtown Atlanta, Miles South, the
manager of the Bristol Green apartment complex in Stockbridge was
thinking about the quiet apartment unit in building 1300. The rent
was late, and he wondered what was up.
</P>
<P>
   He called Henry County Police at 3:23 p.m., less than 30 minutes
after the shooting started in Atlanta, and let an officer in.
</P>
<P>
   Notes on the bodies
</P>
<P>
   After seeing one body, the officer called for backup.
</P>
<P>
   Both Matthew and Elizabeth Mychelle were dead, apparently from
blows to the head. They lay in their beds, all but their faces
covered. A handwritten note rested by each child's body.
</P>
<P>
   Their stepmother also was dead, stuffed in a closet and
similarly covered, with another scribbled note. In the living room
was a longer letter, this one apparently typed out on the computer
Barton so loved.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, meanwhile, was across the city.
</P>
<P>
   Escape in the woods?
</P>
<P>
   At about 3:30 p.m., Lori Woodward and a handful of employees at
the Ivy Place Buildingspotted a man wearing a red shirt and khaki
pants, running south on Piedmont Road toward the Lenox Road
intersection. Woodard and her colleagues had learned from radio and
TV news that police were looking for a shooter wearing those
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea he had just shot the people at Piedmont
center,'' Woodard said. ``We watched him because he looked strange,
He was carrying, like, a knapsack on his back and he was acting
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard said the man ran along the Buckhead Loop in the
direction of Phipps Plaza on Lenox Road. He stopped short however
when he spotted an Atlanta police cruiser rolling his way, Woodard
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point he looked around and then walked up the driveway
of a building that's under construction at the corner of Piedmont
and Lenox,'' Woodard said. ``He kept looking around and looking
over his shoulder. He noticed two more officers at the top of the
driveway, he turned around walked back to the street and then ran
into a patch of woods. We never saw him after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers swarm the buildings
</P>
<P>
   For hours, officers with shotguns searched the parking decks at
Piedmont Center and several office buildings. Employees remained
locked in their offices because officers did not know whether the
killer was still around. Police dogs sniffed the bushes. And FBI
agents dressed for war searched the area along Piemont Road.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours passed before authorities heard from someone who had
seen Barton. Security officers at the Town Center Mall in Kennesaw,
about 20 miles from Buckhead, saw Barton's unoccupied van in the
mall lot about 7:40 p.m. About the same time, a woman who'd been
shopping at Rich's approached her parked car. Barton walked toward
her. He had a black bag that hung over the shoulder of his neatly
pressed blue short-sleeve shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't scream or I'll shoot you,'' he said, according to a
police report.
</P>
<P>
   The woman backed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't run or I'll shoot you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She ran. He did not shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Looming large in a minivan
</P>
<P>
   Mannon Smith, who was also at the mall, said she saw Barton in
the parking lot and recognized him as the suspect in the deadliest
mass murder in Georgia history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was this totally, totally freakish thing,'' Smith said. ``I
was absolutely positive it was him. I was shocked. You pull up
behind a car and here was this guy everone is looking for. Nobody
expected him in Kennesaw. ''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot, 4-inches tall, Barton loomed large in the mini-van,
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   She pulled out her cell phone and dialed 911. Operaters at first
were skeptical, but eventually believed Smith when she described
the van and read off the license plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want him looking back and seeing me on the phone
reporting him,'' Smith said. ``I really wanted to get off the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she briefly followed Barton until he turned onto
Barrett Parkway. He turned right toward I-75. She turned left.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she thought briefly about tailing Barton but quickly
decided to leave that up to the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had just killed 12 people,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, mall officials had alerted police. Officers all over
the northern part of Cobb County were looking for the minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb County Police Officer Huel Clements was on I-75 when he saw
a minivan matching the description of Barton's minivan. He relayed
the tag number by radio to a dispatcher. The dispatcher confirmed
his suspicion: it was Barton's minivan. He followed Barton, keeping
a safe distance at first so as not to tip off Barton that he was
being followed. He also told fellow officers by radio what he had
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   On the run
</P>
<P>
   About 7:50 p.m., as the day continued its slow summer surrender
to evening, Barton turned off the interstate onto Ga. 92 in
Acworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main cocern was keeping survelliance and waiting for
backup,'' Clements said Friday, still wearing the black stripe
across his badge to honor the two Cobb officers who were killed in
the line of duty last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Barton passed a service station on his left and turned right
just past a McDonald's fast-food restaurant. Then he turned left
and eased into a BP gasoline station. Officer Clements, still
behind Barton, turned on his blue lights. Then his siren sounded
for a second or two.
</P>
<P>
   Dane Pritchett, 14, saw what happened next. She was in the
backseat of a car in the McDonald's parking lot, waiting for her
brother and his girlfriend to bring her a fish filet sandwich and
French Fries. She said Barton slowed at the gas pumps, as if he was
going to stop, but then pulled up about 35 feet to a spot between
the pumps and the BP Car Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly an Acworth police cruiser whipped into the gas station
parking lot and stopped in front of the minivan. Officer Clements,
behind Barton's minivan, leapt out of his car, drew his gun and
crouched behind the door of his patrol car. Pritchett said he
trained his gun on the minivan and shouted at its driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was yelling `Get out! Get out!''' Pritchett said.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, Cpl. Curtis Endicott of the Acworth Police
Department had whipped his patrol car into the BP parking lot to
block a possible escape route for Barton.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot's going through your mind when you have suspect of this
magnitude. I was scared,'' Endicott said. ``I didn't know what he
might do.''
</P>
<P>
   As Endicott threw open his door of his police car, Barton raised
a 9mm pistol to one side of his head and a .45 caliber pistol to
the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard a muffled sound,'' Pritchett said, ``and his head
fell against the steering wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about 7:55 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the six Acworth police officers on duty had arrived
by this time. They bounded out of their patrol cars and pointed
their guns at the van. One of the officers walked tensely towards
the driver's side door.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked over and with one hand slung the door open and then
backed off,'' Pritchett said. ``I guess he saw blood or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fowler, the clerk at the Amoco service station across the
street, said he could tell the danger had passed by watching the
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all just started holstering their guns,'' he said. ``I
guess they knew he was dead.

   ATLANTA _ Mark Orrin Barton's life was as unsettled as his death
was unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   He changed jobs frequently, lost tens of thousands of dollars in
the stock market and, for the last six years, couldn't help but
listen to whispers and outright accusations about his role in his
first wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   As authorities continued to investigate a three-day killing
spree that left 13 people dead, including Barton, even his mother
said she couldn't fathom what transformed the 44-year-old
chemist-turned-day trader into the worst mass murderer in Georgia
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I am deeply hurt by the actions of my son, Mark, I
loved him very much,'' Barton's 76-year-old mother, Gladys, said in
a statement issued Thursday at her home in Sumter, S.C. ``I wish
there was some way to explain why this tragedy occurred or some way
that it could have been prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say they have been unable to determine what motivated
Barton to kill his wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday, his children,
Matthew and Mychelle, on Wednesday, and nine people in two Atlanta
office buildings on Thursday before taking his own life.
</P>
<P>
   But the securities firm where Barton began his shooting rampage
disclosed Friday that he had lost $105,000 on 15 trading days
between June 9 and Tuesday _ the day he went home and killed his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard described Barton as
``distraught and troubled,'' a man who ``also felt his wife and his
children were suffering and hurting as well.''
</P>
<P>
   From interviews and court records, a picture emerges of a man
whose life continually lacked a semblance of the normalcy he tried
to display.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to hate this life and this system of things,'' he
wrote early Thursday in a note that police later found in the
living room of his Henry County apartment. ``I have come to have no
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to trace the origins of Barton's despair.
Certainly it does not appear to be rooted in his rather
unremarkable childhood.
</P>
<P>
   An only child whose father worked for the Air Force, Barton
moved with his family to Sumter, S.C., when he was 11. After
graduating from Sumter High School in 1973, Barton attended Clemson
University but dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he enrolled at the University of South Carolina
in Columbia, where he received his bachelor's degree in chemistry
and met the woman who would become his first wife, Debra Spivey.
</P>
<P>
   The university's dormitories in Columbia, S.C., were full, and
Debra lived at the Wade Hampton Hotel where Barton worked nights.
They were married May 5, 1979. Soon they were living in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   That year, he took a job as a chemist for a company called Zep
Manufacturing, which soon transferred him to its Dallas laboratory.
He remained with the company about four years, said Andy Logue,
vice president of human resources for Zep's parent company,
National Service Industries.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, however, Barton's professional and personal lives
followed a rocky path.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Barton accepted a job at TLC Manufacturing, a
Texarkana, Texas, company that made cleaning compounds. By 1988, he
had been named TLC's president. He made as much as $86,000 a year
and controlled 5 percent of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later, he was fired. In a deposition, Barton said
TLC executives became upset when they learned he was moving back to
Atlanta to start his own business.
</P>
<P>
   But Texarkana police records also show that, after being fired
from TLC, Barton was arrested Sept. 25, 1990, and briefly jailed on
charges that he stole computer discs and notebook binders filled
with information from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Charges against him were dropped a day later because TLC board
members declined to prosecute him, Texarkana police spokesman Jeff
Heminger said.
</P>
<P>
   After moving back to Georgia, Barton started his own company, a
chemistry consulting firm called Highlander Pride Inc., in July
1990. But the company was more ``like having a paper route,'' he
testified, because it never generated more than a few thousand
dollars of business a year. In January 1992, after resigning from a
raw material distribution company in Kennesaw, Barton became a
sales representative for Macon-based Lomas International, selling
raw materials to manufacturers in the rubber, ink and paint
industries, said Julie Van Brunt, a spokeswoman for the company,
now known as Lintech International.
</P>
<P>
   With a $50,000 salary and a company Taurus, Barton oversaw sales
from North Georgia to the Florida Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   A year after he joined the company, he met a new employee:
20-year-old Leigh Ann Vandiver, a customer-support telephone
operator. She married David Lang a month after starting work, in
February 1993.
</P>
<P>
   By that spring, she and Barton were having an affair.
</P>
<P>
   On the road most of the time, Barton said he always seemed to
get Leigh Ann when he called the office.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Ann told him she liked older guys and had told Barton he
was ``pretty,'' based on his photo in the company annual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flirted with each other on the phone,'' Barton said, adding
that he began buying new clothes and going to a tanning salon.
</P>
<P>
   They consummated their relationship in May 1993, Barton
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Barton was playing golf with his buddies at the end of August
when he called Leigh Ann using one of his friend's cell phones.
During this call, Barton testified, she told him she planned to
leave her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Barton was scheduled to make a quarterly sales trip through the
Florida Panhandle in September 1993, and Leigh Ann was to accompany
him to Panama City. The trip was to take place the weekend after
Labor Day _ the weekend after Barton's wife and mother-in-law were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Ann moved out of the home she shared with her husband two
days before the bodies of Debra Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise
Powell Spivey, 59, were found in a travel trailer at the Riverside
Campground at Weiss Lake in Alabama. They had been hacked to death
with a sharp, heavy blade.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Edgar Smith, an investigator with the district attorney's
office that covers Cedar Grove, Ala., where Debra and her mother
were killed,said evidence indicated the victims knew their killer,
since there were no signs of forced entry or struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Bloody footprints led to the trailer's driveway and witnesses
said they saw a car like Barton's company-leased Ford the night of
the murders. He was told not to wash his car, but drove it through
a car wash the next day and wiped up the interior after supposedly
spilling a Sprite, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they found blood in Barton's car, garage and
home. Barton's defense lawyer, Michael Hauptman, said in an
interview that the killer was an unspecified itinerate roofer who
confessed to the killing. This person is now serving an unrelated
prison sentence in Indiana, Hauptman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said this man was ruled out as a suspect after his
statements did not match evidence and investigators learned he had
spent the night of the murders with friends.
</P>
<P>
   During his deposition, Barton said the last time he saw Debra
alive was when she pulled out of their home in her mother's red
Thunderbird for the Labor Day camping weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time he'd kept the children overnight by
himself, he testified.
</P>
<P>
   That night, with the children worn out and tired, Barton said he
sang them songs, read them stories and then put them to bed. He
played on the computer, listened to a new Mary-Chapin Carpenter
album and finished off a six-pack, falling asleep on the sofa,
awoke during the night and headed to bed.
</P>
<P>
   ADDITONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before Debra Barton's killing, her husband had
taken out twin life insurance policies _ $600,000 for him, $600,000
for her.
</P>
<P>
   Barton testified Debra insisted she have a policy equal to his
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``She developed the concept that her worth was equal to mine and
that if something happened to her, I would have my hands full
taking care of the two kids,'' Barton testified. ``And she wanted
the exact same life insurance that I had, rather than having a
smaller amount.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Debra and her mother, Eloise Spivey, were found hacked
to death, the insurers holding the policies didn't buy Barton's
story.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies, Investors Life Insurance Co. of Nebraska and
Primerica Life Co., took Barton to court. Lawyers for Investors
Life went so far as to accuse Barton of the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that he was involved in those deaths,'' Ben
Kingree III, an Atlanta lawyer who represented Investors Life, said
Friday. ``She was a housewife with no income and a $600,000 life
insurance policy. Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors Life, which filed suit in 1994, settled with Barton in
September 1997. The company paid out $450,000 as part of a
settlement, with $150,000 going to a trust fund to Barton's
children and almost $300,000 being shared by Barton and his
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Barton collected $5,000 on another policy and received almost
$66,000 on a $100,000 rider policy he had bought for his wife years
before from Primerica, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   In the insurance lawsuit, Smith testified that he believed only
Barton could have been guilty. But the case never went to a grand
jury for indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Smith pursued the case through a different tack, though.
</P>
<P>
   He met with Leigh Ann in Macon, he said in an interview Friday,
to warn her that she might be next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her then, whenever she ceased to fill his needs, then
he'd kill her, too,'' he said. ``The lifestyle that he had
indicated that he needed (required) a young, sexy wife to maintain
the status quo. That's what he felt like he needed. I told her, I
said, `When you cease to fill those needs, you know he's going to
kill you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ADDITONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Barton and Lang both resigned from Lomas in October 1994. The
following May 26, they were married in Clayton County.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Barton had taken a sales job with Alchem
Chemical Co. in Atlanta. Not long after he joined the company, said
general manager Chuck Matthews, co-workers began hearing rumors
about Barton's suspected role in his wife's death. ``This has
always been on the back of everybody's minds,'' Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1997, Barton left Alchem and went to work for Micro-Blend
Chemical Co. In March, the company filed court papers in Clayton
County Superior Court over a debt by Barton, records show.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1999, Barton ventured out of the chemical industry for
the first time in his career, joining the volatile world of day
trading in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   He opened an account at the Atlanta office of Momentum
Securities Inc. on May 13.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he claimed a net worth of $750,000, with $250,000
in liquid assets. His income from Micro-Blend, he said, was $85,000
a year. His wife, he added, made $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   He told company executives that he had seen their advertisement
on the CNBC cable business-news network.
</P>
<P>
   At Momentum, Barton enjoyed little of the success that other
investors have experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Between June 9 and last Tuesday, he lost $105,000, according to
a letter that Momentum sent Friday to the Securities and Exchange
Commission. On Thursday, with his children and wife laying dead in
their apartment, Barton sat at the computer he had used to track
stock prices and wrote a chilling confession that concluded, ``You
should kill me if you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he met with his lawyer, Joseph H. Fowler of Douglasville,
to attend to what Fowler on Friday described as ``routine will and
estate issues.''
</P>
<P>
   With stock prices falling, Barton drove his green minivan to the
Buckhead secdtion of Atlanta. He walked into Momentum's third-floor
trading room and exchanged routine greetings with other traders and
company employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made comments to the extent it was a bad trading day,''
said Harvard, the Atlanta police chief, ``and something to the
effect that it was going to get worse.''

   Argentina has formally requested to become the first Latin

VICTIMS WERE DRAWN TO THEIR DEATHS BY LIVES IN DAY TRADING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kansas)  (rk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR. AND DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There were 22 of them, 22 people with disparate lives
and interests, lives filled with children and lovers, with keeping
store and fly-fishing, with building that dream house and chasing
the American dream. But on Thursday afternoon, in a quiet office
park here, they were 22 people with a single common interest,
electronic day trading.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, a fortune could be lost or won with the punch
of a computer button. On this particular hot Thursday, Dean
Delawalla was one of nine day traders and trading house employees
who lost their lives when Mark O. Barton went on his pistol-firing
rampage in two trading offices. Thirteen other people were wounded,
nine seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Delawalla, 52, made his living day trading, showing up almost
every morning at the office park. But family and friends say day
trading was just his job, not his life. His life, as they tell it,
was his wife, Gulshan, a medical intern, and their two children,
Saisal, 15, and Shahla, 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were everything he lived for,'' said his brother, Seroz
Delawalla. ``He spent almost all of his time with them when he
wasn't trading. In fact, he just traded to have money to take care
of them and make a nice home here in America. That was his dream
from the day he arrived in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Delawalla, a native of Pakistan, came to the United States in
1973. He had been trained as a lawyer and a banker but once in
America headed off in new career directions, first in the medical
supply business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was looking for new opportunities, exploring,'' his brother
said. ``Eventually he began trading in options. And then when day
trading came along, he got into that. What else to say? It's over
for him. A tragedy. What a tragedy. Now we must look to Gulshan and
the children.''
</P>
<P>
   For Edward Quinn of Norcross, an Atlanta suburb, trading was
just a retirement pastime. He had already made his financial mark,
as an executive with the United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   So he did not show up at the office complex every day,
frequently preferring to play a round of golf or try his hand at
fly-fishing in a local stream. But he did show up on Thursday, and
doing so cost him his life.
</P>
<P>
   A Norcross neighbor, Eve Hoffman, described him as ``a quiet
man, absolutely a devoted family man,'' who, already retired at the
age of 58, had an unquenchable passion for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain people who you are around and they love
life,'' Ms. Hoffman said. ``And there are other people who are just
getting through it. He loved life completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn left a wife of 31 years, Mary, and three grown children.
Three weeks ago he became a grandfather for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Tenenbaum usually visited in the morning at the office
where he traded. But on Thursday he went in the afternoon, and, as
with Quinn, the timing of the visit proved fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just happened to be there,'' said his brother-in-law,
Freddy Allen of Greensboro, N.C. ``It was a little unusual for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenenbaum, 48, owned a grocery store in Atlanta, Great Savings,
and was an avid golfer and a devoted jogger, putting in at least
four miles every day. He also served as president of his synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Like most survivors of the nine people killed, Tenenbaum's felt
particularly hard hit by the random way that fate had seemed to
choose him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't explain it,'' Allen said. ``It's just a tragic loss
for no reason. And it's not just his family, it's his community. A
lot of people feel the loss. It's just really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenenbaum left a wife of 18 years, Debra, and three children:
Megan, 11; Brittany, 13, and Scott, 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Tenenbaum and Allen families were to meet on Sunday in
Myrtle Beach, S.C., for a vacation. Instead, they gathered in
Atlanta Friday for a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Vadewattee Muralidhara was down at the trading
office, her family frantically began trying to reach her on
learning of the shooting. But the Muralidharas had no success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were calling everywhere,'' said her 18-year-old son, Rishi.
``She hadn't come home. She took care of us, took most of her time
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was a knock on the door. It was a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought she would be one of the witnesses,'' the son said.
</P>
<P>
   But the officer was bringing word of her death. She was 44 and
lived with her family in Peachtree City, another Atlanta suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Among the others killed were Russell J. Brown, 42, of the nearby
town of Cumming; Kevin Dial, 38, of Atlanta, and Scott A. Webb, 30,
also of Atlanta. No biographical details about them were available.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the police release the names of the two additional
people slain, pending notification of relatives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the 13 people hurt in the attack were Brent Doonan, 25,
and Scott Manspeaker, 27, both of whom ran the local office of the
All-Tech Investment Group, one of the two trading houses that
Barton invaded. Both men were seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   They grew up in Kansas and recently moved to Atlanta ``to find
their fortune in this new world of day trading,'' as one friend,
Derek Schimming, put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're young and aggressive and hungry to carve out their
piece of America,'' said Schimming, who manages a day trading
operation in Overland Park, Kan. ``They'll bounce back and they'll
make it, because that's what day trading is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Schimming was on the phone to Doonan just minutes before the
gunman burst in.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a senseless tragedy,'' he said. ``It just boggles the
mind. But like I say, people will bounce back. You have to believe
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the bounce-back seemed to be already under way Friday
morning at the office park. Cleaning crews were hard at work,
cutting out stained sections of office carpet and mopping down
floors and walls.
</P>
<P>
   The two trading firms hit by the violence _ Momentum Securities
in addition to All-Tech _ were not open for business, but other
firms were. Eric Blaier, a sales manager, lamented the violence of
the day before, but then added: ``In the game of telecom sales,
it's business as usual. Unfortunately true.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the entrance to the building where he works, someone had
left a bright bouquet of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' the attached note read. ``God bless you.''

AS GUN SEIZURES DROP, POLICE UNIT'S USE OF UNIFORMS IS
RECONSIDERED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gun seizures by the Police Department's embattled
street crime unit have fallen so sharply since the shooting of
Amadou Diallo in February that officials are leaning toward putting
some of the elite force back into plain clothes, police said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 307-person unit has been a critical tool in New York City's
successful effort to seize guns and curb violent crime. But its gun
seizures have plummeted by 40 percent this year, compared with the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statistics show that we certainly have not been as
productive as we had been before,'' Police Commissioner Howard
Safir said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said that the department's decision last March,
seven weeks after the Diallo shooting, to have every officer in
what had been a plainclothes unit begin wearing a uniform is one of
several factors in the falloff. Safir said some officers have said
the uniforms hinder their effectiveness, especially in situations
in which they need to act as decoys or conduct surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, he has asked his staff to come up with a
plan under which those officers whose tasks require stealth might
dress in street clothes, while those making arrests would continue
to wear uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   In February, four officers of the street crime unit who were
looking for a rape suspect in the Bronx fatally shot Diallo, an
unarmed West African immigrant, in the vestibule of his apartment
building. The plainclothes officers fired 41 bullets, and later
said they thought Diallo was reaching for a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The move to uniforms was intended to reduce confusion during
potentially lethal confrontations in which officers in jeans and
sweatshirts carrying guns might not be recognizable by the public.
In the Diallo shooting, the four officers were dressed in street
clothes, although their lawyers have said they identified
themselves before the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said that under a plan being discussed, each street crime
team would consist of six people, four of whom would be in uniform
and two in street clothes. After the plainclothes officers had
finished their surveillance, the uniformed officers would move in
to make any arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan, if I decide to go with it, addresses both the
concerns of the officers, in their ability to operate close in,''
Safir said, ``and the concern of the public of misidentification.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrests by the unit for illegal gun possession are also down by
45 percent this year, police statistics show. In Brooklyn, where
shootings and homicides are beginning to climb from 30-year lows,
police officials have theorized that the decline in gun seizures
may be playing a role in the rising violence.
</P>
<P>
   But one analyst, Thomas Reppetto, president of the Citizens
Crime Commission, said that last year, before the Diallo incident,
there had already been a drop-off in gun arrests citywide, in part
because the unit's success had persuaded many criminals not to
carry them. ``Today it is much harder to find gunmen and thus,
consequently harder to make gun arrests,'' he said.

(ATTN: N.Y.)  
 MRS. CLINTON NOT YET READY TO MIX IT UP WITH GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATH, N.Y. _ When it comes to political combat, there are few
potential targets that are off-limits for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
and certainly not his likely opponent in next year's race for the
U.S. Senate, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mrs. Clinton completed the second day of her third
exploratory trip to New York on Friday, it was clear that at least
for now, the first lady is consciously avoiding direct engagement
with her potential rival. And that is emerging as an early
stylistic distinction between these two very high-profile
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the same week that Giuliani flew to Arkansas to draw
attention to one of his recurrent criticisms of Mrs. Clinton _ that
she has never lived a day in New York _ the first lady has
studiously avoided any mention of the Republican mayor. That became
particularly obvious at a news conference Friday, her third since
beginning these tours, in which she softly batted aside a
procession of inviting pitches from reporters intended to draw her
out on the subject of her Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to comment on someone else's campaign tactics,''
Mrs. Clinton said with a sweet, quick smile, at the public library
in this western New York town. A reporter had inquired whether she
thought Giuliani had been taunting her with his visit to Little
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   She would not, she said, join the chorus of Democrats who
criticized Giuliani's decision to hoist the Arkansas state flag
over City Hall in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And when another reporter inquired about the fact that Giuliani
had declined to take a position on the tax bill that congressional
Republicans are pushing in Congress, the first lady demurred yet
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will only speak for myself,'' Mrs. Clinton said,
notwithstanding the fact that she began attacking the tax cut
Thursday in part to try to force Giuliani into a politically
difficult choice: Either endorse a Republican tax plan that her
aides believe is unpopular in New York, or alienate Republican
leaders in Congress whose support he needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have grave concerns regarding the fiscal irresponsibility of
this tax cut,'' she said. ``I want the people of New York to know
where I stand on it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is extraordinarily early in what is still an unformed
campaign: Neither Giuliani nor Mrs. Clinton has officially declared
a candidacy yet. Still, this week's developments invite some early
questions about the first lady's style as a campaigner _ which, for
all her years in public life, is something of a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Does she have a taste for the kind of political combat that is
common in New York campaigns? The first lady is married to a man
who has never shown any reluctance to engage in hardball politics _
with, according to most accounts, the encouragement of the first
lady. But it's one thing to push one's spouse into the ring; it's
another to take and offer the punches oneself.
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks Friday suggest that for the time being, at least,
Mrs. Clinton will take the quiet road. Her aides described it as a
deliberate decision, as she begins to paint her political
personality in New York. Accordingly, the juxtaposition of Mrs.
Clinton talking to voters in upstate New York, with Giuliani
hamming it up at the governor's mansion in Little Rock, Ark., was
welcomed by the first lady's advisers Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But they say her low-key approach should not be interpreted as
any sign of reluctance about making the race. Mrs. Clinton brushed
aside questions Friday about whether she was having any second
thoughts as she plodded along with her schedule of discussions with
voters. ``I am more and more excited about the prospect of this
possible race and feel very encouraged about what people are
telling me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And she just chuckled when asked about an editorial in Friday's
Wall Street Journal predicting that Mrs. Clinton would ultimately
forgo this contest and take a job as president of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee, I didn't know it had been offered to me,'' she said.
``I'm interested in pursuing this very exciting possibility of
considering a run for the Senate from right here in New York. It is
the only thing I'm interested in. And I get more interested and
excited about it every day.''

GUNMAN BLAMED WIFE, BUT WANTED TO SAVE KIDS FROM LIFETIME OF PAIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The gunman who slaughtered his family and then nine
people at two stock trading firms left behind a chilling letter
filled with a mix of remorse and revenge but offering few clues as
to what caused his three-day rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the details don't matter. There is no excuse, no good
reason. I am sure no one will understand. If they could I wouldn't
want them to. I just write these things to say why,'' read a
portion of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   In the one-page letter printed from a computer and dated
Thursday, Mark Orrin Barton described how he killed his estranged
second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, 27, with a hammer Tuesday, then beat
and drowned his two children the following day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the kids were (the 24 hours after Leigh Ann Barton was
killed), I have absolutely no way of knowing,'' said Jimmy Mercer,
chief of the Henry County Police, the agency investigating the
three deaths in Stockbridge, near Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to pains to conceal the body so you can't help but
think the kids were in and out during that time,'' Mercer said.
Barton's wife was found in a closet in the apartment home.
</P>
<P>
   Barton walked Thursday into the office of two brokerage firms
where he traded and fired randomly at traders and employees. Nine
died and 13 were wounded. Hours later, he killed himself as police
pulled over his van.
</P>
<P>
   The letter indicates he killed his children from his first
marriage, Matthew, 11, and Michelle, 8, to save them from a painful
existence. Their mother and maternal grandmother were savagely
beaten to death with a tool in Alabama in 1993. Although Barton was
considered the prime suspect, he was never charged in that case and
denied any involvement in the letter he left.
</P>
<P>
   The former chemist turned day trader in stocks likened his
wife's death to the shooting rampage he went on Thursday. He gave
no clear motive for those killings other than he blamed his wife
and the people at the companies for his depression.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at one of the businesses, Momentum Securities, said
Barton used the Atlanta office for 15 days of trading beginning
June 9, and lost $105,000. The other business, All-Tech Investment
Group, would not release his trading history there.
</P>
<P>
   Barton made no reference to his trading in the letter but
mentioned his plan to kill others twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan to live very much longer, just long enough to
kill as many of the people that greedily sought my destruction. You
should kill me if you can,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter apparently was signed by Barton and contained names
and numbers of three people _ his mother, Gladys Barton; his
children's maternal grandfather, Bill Spivey; and an attorney, Joe
Fowler. At first authorities thought the three might be intended
targets but later decided they were just people to contact about
the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, Barton, 44, shot himself to death in his
minivan as police stopped him at an gas station in Acworth, just
north of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was found Thursday night lying on a coffee table in
the living room of Barton's estranged wife's apartment in
Stockbridge, about 30 miles south of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Three handwritten notes also were found on each of the bodies.
Each contained two sentences describing his love for each and
asking someone to take care of them.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the letter were not released, but Mercer read the
letter to reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This letter was left in a very obvious place,'' Mercer said.
``We didn't have to do any searching. They (the letter and notes
with each body) were very visible from the time you walked in.''
</P>
<P>
   The printed letter was addressed ``To Whom It May Concern.'' It
began with a matter-of-fact tone: ``Leigh Ann is in the master
bedroom closet under a blanket. I killed her Tuesday night. I
killed Matthew and Michelle Wednesday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton wrote of the similarities between the deaths and those of
his first wife of 15 years, Debra Spivey Barton, 36, and her
mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59. They were hacked to death six
years ago in a camper at Lake Weiss, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``However I deny killing her and her mother. There is no reason
for me to lie now,'' Barton wrote. ``It just seemed like a quiet
way to kill and a relatively painless way to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was little pain. All of them were dead in less than five
minutes. I hit them with a hammer in their sleep and then put them
facedown in the bathtub to make sure that they did not wake up in
pain, to make sure they were dead. I am so sorry. I wish I didn't.
Words cannot tell the agony. Why did I?''
</P>
<P>
   Barton wrote only that he had ``been dying since October'' and
since then had terrifying dreams he could no longer live with. The
letter never explained what caused the dreams or his sense of
hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   He only wrote: ``It has taken its toll. I have come to hate this
life in this system of things. I have come to have no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The only explanation Barton does reveal is that he killed his
children out of what appears to be a distorted sense of compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I killed the children to exchange for them five minutes of
pain for a lifetime of pain,'' he wrote. ``I forced myself to do it
to keep them from suffering so much later. No mother, no father, no
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fears of the father are transferred to the son. It was
from my father to me and from me to my son. He already had it and
now to be left alone, I had to take him with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the children were found in the other bedroom of
the two-bedroom apartment. Each was lying in a separate bed with
blankets and bed coverings pulled up to their faces. A handwritten
note was lying on top of each bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any part of the body aside from just a square
portion of their face visible,'' Mercer said. ``It was almost like
they were sleeping. There was certainly not any visible blood that
I saw... We saw some blood splatters on the wall, but it also
appeared to be this individual went to some extreme in terms of
trying to clean up the mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The beds containing the children appeared to be some sort of
shrine in tribute to each. Next to Matthew's body was a video game,
and next to Michelle a stuffed toy.
</P>
<P>
   But Barton blamed his wife in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for
my demise, as I plan to kill the others. I really wish I hadn't
killed her now. She really couldn't help it, and I love her so much
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Several draft versions of the letter were found on the computer
in the home, Mercer said.
</P>
<P>
   That Barton's depression led him to kill at home and the
workplace is unusual, said John Vincent, a professor of psychology
at the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's chilling to hear those words,'' Vincent said. ``This
pattern is not nearly as common as a typical outraged employee
seeking revenge on a higher authority or a co-worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent said it appeared Barton planned to kill the people at
the day trading firms simply because they symbolized those who were
profiting at his expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sense of somebody has to pay,'' Vincent said. Despite
the denial of his involvement in the Alabama slaying, authorities
there have said they consider the murder case of Debra Benton and
Eloise Spivey to be closed now.
</P>
<P>
   Barton had taken out a $600,000 in life insurance on his first
wife before her death and eventually settled with the insurance
company for $450,000, according to federal court records obtained
by The Associated Press. About $150,000 was to be held in trust for
his children. After legal fees, Barton was left with $194,000.
</P>
<P>
   The AP also reported that Barton lived in Texarkana, Texas, in
the late 1980s and was fired from his job as president of TLC
Manufacturing after a burglary investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the handguns Barton used in the spree, a Colt
.45-caliber, was traced to a North Texas gun dealer, police said,
and had been registered to another purchaser in 1983. Barton
registered the other, a 9 mm Glock, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   With the letter and eyewitness accounts of Barton's shooting
spree in Atlanta, Mercer said his investigation into the deaths of
Leigh Ann Barton and the children is concluded but authorities
would continue to search for a motive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a number of people for a long period of time
trying to put the pieces to the puzzle together to find out why it
is that Mr. Barton was provoked to the extent that he was, that he
felt the need to take out as many people as he did,'' Mercer said.
``I don't have those answers at this time and I doubt anyone else
does either.''

INKSTER USES SHORT GAME TO COME UP BIG 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRIDDIS, Alberta _ Even when Juli Inkster is not at her very
best, the results can be very good.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling with her swing, yet managing to score on a difficult
course, Inkster shared the lead with Dawn Coe-Jones of Canada after
Friday's second round of the du Maurier Classic. Inkster and
Coe-Jones were at 7 under par (137), one stroke ahead of Laura
Davies of England and Catriona Matthew of Scotland. Inkster shot a
3-under par 69, including birdies on two of her last three holes,
while Coe-Jones shot a blistering 65, the best round of the
tournament so far at Priddis Greens Golf and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a historic weekend for Inkster, who is trying to
join Pat Bradley who thus far is the only player to win three of
the Ladies Professional Golf Association's four modern majors in
one season. Bradley did it in 1986, and Inkster has already won
this year's U.S. Women's Open and the McDonald's LPGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   A victory this weekend would also earn Inkster a place in the
LPGA Hall of Fame. A player needs 27 career points to reach the
Hall of Fame, with two points awarded for winning a major, one
point for nonmajors and one point for the Vare Trophy or Rolex
Player of the Year Award. Inkster has 26 career points.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Inkster survived an up-and-down round, making six
birdies to offset three bogeys. At times, it wasn't pretty, but at
the end of the day, it was effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struggling with my swing out there,'' said Inkster, who
has won five majors, including the 1984 du Maurier when she was a
rookie. ``Hopefully, this is my toughest day, and I can get a
little more consistent with my swing. I'm really proud of the way I
scored. My short game bailed me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were not as fortunate, as the first-round co-leaders
Rosie Jones and Patti Rizzo struggled. Starting the day at 5 under
par, Rizzo shot a 4-over par 76, while Jones shot a 74. Jones had a
12:30 p.m. tee time, and the weather changed for the worse during
her round, as the wind picked up and the temperature dropped
following a brief shower.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Inkster and Coe-Jones teed off in the morning, as did Davies
(66), and they finished before the weather changed. It was the best
round of the year for Coe-Jones, who has just one top-10 finish
this year. When Coe-Jones walked into the media room to be
interviewed, she felt like a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been in here for about three years,'' joked
Coe-Jones, who has not won on the tour since 1995. ``I come in here
to get magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   But this week has been a homecoming for Coe-Jones, who was born
in British Columbia, and she was followed by an enthusiastic
gallery that watched her make seven birdies during a bogey-free
round. Teeing off on the 10th hole, Coe-Jones had her best stretch
during the middle or her round, when she birdied No. 17, No. 18,
No. 2 and No. 3. Three of those birdies came on putts of 15 feet or
more.
</P>
<P>
   While Coe-Jones enjoyed her stretch of success, Inkster hoped to
ride her momentum to a historic victory. And with 36 holes to play,
she liked her chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy with where I am,'' Inkster said. ``Every time I
tee it up, I feel like I can win. I feel like it could be my
week.''

<P>
   Following are excerpts from a letter and the texts of three
notes apparently written by Mark O. Barton and left in the Barton
home, as read by Chief Jimmy Mercer of the Henry County police and
recorded by The New York Times. Mercer said that the letter was
dated July 29, 6:38 a.m., and that he was omitting three telephone
numbers of people mentioned at the end of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   THE LETTER
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Ann is in the master bedroom closet under a blanket. I
killed her on Tuesday night. I killed Matthew and Mychele Wednesday
night. There may be similarities between these deaths and the death
of my first wife, Debra Spivey. However, I deny killing her and her
mother. There is no reason for me to lie now. It just seemed like a
quiet way to kill and a relatively painless way to die. There was
little pain. All of them were dead in less than five minutes. I hit
them with the hammer in their sleep and then put them face-down in
the bathtub to make sure they did not wake up in pain, to make sure
they were dead.
</P>
<P>
   I'm so sorry. I wish I didn't. Words cannot tell the agony. Why
did I? I have been dying since October. Wake up at night so afraid,
so terrified that I couldn't be that afraid while awake. It has
taken its toll. I have come to hate this life in this system of
things. I have come to have no hope. I killed the children to
exchange them for five minutes of pain or a lifetime of pain. I
forced myself to do it to keep them from suffering so much later.
No mother, no father, no relatives. The fears of the father are
transferred to the son. It was from my father to me and from me to
my son. He already had it. And now to be left alone. I had to take
him with me.
</P>
<P>
   I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for
my demise. ... I know that Jehovah will take care of all of them in
the next life. I'm sure the details don't matter. There is no
excuse, no good reason I am sure no one will understand. If they
could I wouldn't want them to. I just write these things to say
why. Please know that I love Leigh Ann, Matthew and Mychele with
all my heart. If Jehovah's willing I would like to see them all
again in the resurrection to have a second chance. I don't plan to
live very much longer, just long enough to kill as many of the
people that greedily sought my destruction.
</P>
<P>
   THE NOTES
</P>
<P>
   I give you my wife Leigh Ann Vanderver Barton, my honey, my
precious love. Please take care of her. I will love her forever.
</P>
<P>
   I give you Matthew David Barton, my son, my buddy, my life.
Please take care of him.
</P>
<P>
   I give you Mychele Elizabeth Barton, my daughter, my sweetheart,
my life. Please take care of her.

<P>
   Microsoft Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. on Friday confirmed
the existence of several significant software security flaws that
could enable intruders to gain access to the computers of millions
of customers and to damage their data via e-mail or through
commands sent from a malicious Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Certain Hewlett-Packard computers are also said by one expert to
be vulnerable, but a spokesman for the company said Friday that the
company would not confirm the security vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The vulnerabilities, which affect computers running Microsoft's
Windows operating system and Internet Explorer browser in
combination with other programs, are invisible to antivirus
programs, illustrating the risks inherent in the growing complexity
of today's personal computer software.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who are at the greatest risk are those running
programs shipped as part of Microsoft's Office 97 suite of
productivity programs _ Word 97 or Excel 97 _ and owners of certain
newer models of computers made by Compaq and Hewlett-Packard that
automatically upgrade the manufacturers' own software over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft official said the company was at work creating a fix
for the the newly discovered security holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take security issues very seriously,'' said Andrew Dixon,
group product manager for Office at Microsoft. ``Right now, we are
working on testing a solution and steps for customers to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The new flaws also raise troubling questions about Microsoft's
decision to integrate its Explorer web browser directly into the
Windows operating system. That decision is a key issue in the
company's antitrust battle with the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has passionately defended the browser integration,
asserting that it offers significant consumer benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of computer security experts who are familiar with
the newly discovered flaws said that by tightly integrating Web
browsing software with its personal computer operating system,
Microsoft has greatly complicated the challenge of ensuring that
Windows is secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A single operating system and single provider of tools
dominates the market,'' said Doug Tygar, a professor of computer
science at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes
in computer security. ``Because Microsoft is linking all these
aspects of computing, all the walls that usually prevent such
attacks aren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of flaws were posted on NTbugtraq, a computer security
mailing list, over the past two days. There is no evidence that the
flaws have been exploited, according to the manufacturers involved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The flaws involve two separate interactions of programs with the
Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   The first involves a vulnerability in one version of a ``dynamic
link library,'' or DLL file that is part of Microsoft's Office 97
suite. The flaw is believed not to exist in the newly released
version, Office 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The office software component, known as JET version 3.5, creates
a security vulnerability because Microsoft has configured its
Internet Explorer program to ``trust'' Office programs, including
Word, Excel and Powerpoint. These programs can create documents
that are themselves powerful programs and that can act as a Trojan
Horse, carrying malicious code into a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Jet flaw was first reported by Juan Carlos G. Cuartango, a
programmer who has previously discovered several security holes in
two browsers _ Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape
Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Although the flawed version of Jet was replaced with a newer
version in the last boxes of Office 97 shipped, the original still
resides on the hard drives of millions of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The new flaw does not involve the small programs call ``macros''
that have caused Microsoft security headaches in the past. Rather
Jet sends queries to various data bases when the Office programs
request data. The queries can be used to trigger low-level
operating system commands _ including commands that erase files or
entire hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the extensive integration between Office applications
and Windows, such a query can be sent on behalf of a cell in a
spreadsheet, a field in a word document or other interactive
portions of an Office application.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the new flaw especially serious is that anti-virus
software does not monitor such queries and therefore would not be
effective against an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Dixon said Friday that the company was considering
giving users a new alert mechanism that would warn them about data
base queries before they were executed.
</P>
<P>
   The second security flaw has to do with the way software shipped
with computers from Compaq and Hewlett-Packard _ and possibly other
manufacturers _ is designed to interact with the Internet Explorer
Web browser. The manufacturers' software, designed to work with the
security controls in Internet Explorer 4.0, would enable an
intruder to execute arbitrary commands on a computer remotely.
</P>
<P>
   The Compaq security flaw appears particularly serious since it
can be spread to other brands of computers. Compaq's Presario
computers, which are consumer models, are shipped with a tiny Java
program, known as an applet, that has been ``digitally signed'' a
term that means it has been authenticated by Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   This applet is designed to enable Compaq to update programs on a
computer over the Internet or other computer networks. But it also
has the power to execute programs _ and can be directed to do so by
a Web page. The applet can also be sent to other computers via
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   While the existence of this program was posted to a European
security mailing list a year ago, a recent bug that exacerbates the
problem was discovered by Richard Smith, the president of Pharlap
Software, in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the problem, Microsoft's integrated Web browser will
run any program digitally signed by Compaq, in some cases without
warning the user.
</P>
<P>
   While the vulnerable program will run without any warnings only
on certain Compaq Presarios in their default configurations, it can
also be sent to and temporarily stored on any computer running
Windows 95, 98 or NT, according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the browser will pop open a box saying that the
browser wants to run a program digitally signed by Compaq Corp. If
the user responds by allowing the program to run, it will execute
commands on the computer.

CURREN RIDES PAST DORIAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. _ The announcer introduced Tom Curren
as ``the best surfer in the history of California.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the most exciting heat of the Gotcha Pro, Curren surfed a
wily heat to edge Hawaiian Shane Dorian 16.35 to 16.25 Friday in
the third round of the World Championship Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really a heat that came down to a surfing contest,''
Curren said. ``It came down to tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Curren's tactics worked, even though the 35-year-old trailed the
majority of the heat after Dorian surfed in between the poles of
the Huntington Beach Pier to notch a heat-high 7.75. However,
Curren repeatedly rode waves to catch up until he needed just a 6.0
with one minute left to beat Dorian.
</P>
<P>
   Curren, a crowd favorite, is one of 16 surfers remaining in the
48-surfer tournament. Ten surfers from the mainland have competed
in the Gotcha Pro, but only three remain: Curren, Kelly Slater and
Shea Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   The wild bunch: Three of the four wild-card competitors have
advanced, including Curren and Slater. Another wild card, Brazilian
Neco Padaratz, finished highest among unranked surfers in last
week's surfing U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Padaratz has become one of the favorites of this Gotcha Pro. Not
only did he knock out surf legend Mark Occhilupo in the second
round, he beat Michael Campbell 23.0 to 22.6 in the third. Padaratz
had the best single-wave score of the day with a 9.0.
</P>
<P>
   Slater update: Slater beat Damien Hardman, a two-time WCT champ,
12.75 to 12.00 after both were left without quality waves.
</P>
<P>
   Slater is not on the WCT this season after winning his sixth
championship last year. But he doesn't appear rusty after his tour
departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like second nature,'' Slater said. ``It's like lying down
six weeks and thinking you can't walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he'd like to see in this Gotcha Pro, Slater said,
``Me and Curren in the semis, man.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the overwhelming sentiment at the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Irons dethroned: Andy Irons, who was the champion in both weeks
of competition at Huntington last year, lost his heat to Australian
Nathan Webster 20.65 to 12.75. Webster jumped to an early lead and
controlled the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't add anything special to beat him as defending
champ,'' Webster said. ``Andy's always going to be tough to beat,
whether he's the defending champ or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Beachley's wave ends: Layne Beachley, 1998 women's WCT champion,
was knocked out in the quarterfinals by fellow Australian Pauline
Menczer, 14.75 to 12.05. Beachley had been hampered by a torn
ligament in her left knee and competed against the advice of
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Tita Tavares, Rochelle Ballard and Trudy Todd will join Menczer
in the semifinals at 1:10 p.m. today. The women's and men's finals
are Sunday at 12:10 p.m.

<P>
   Microsoft Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. on Friday confirmed
the existence of several significant software security flaws that
could enable intruders to gain access to the computers of millions
of customers and to damage their data via e-mail or through
commands sent from a malicious Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Certain Hewlett-Packard computers are also said by one expert to
be vulnerable, but a spokesman for the company said Friday that the
company would not confirm the security vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The vulnerabilities, which affect computers running Microsoft's
Windows operating system and Internet Explorer browser in
combination with other programs, are invisible to antivirus
programs, illustrating the risks inherent in the growing complexity
of today's personal computer software.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who are at the greatest risk are those running
programs shipped as part of Microsoft's Office 97 suite of
productivity programs _ Word 97 or Excel 97 _ and owners of certain
newer models of computers made by Compaq and Hewlett-Packard that
automatically upgrade the manufacturers' own software over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft official said the company was at work creating a fix
for the the newly discovered security holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take security issues very seriously,'' said Andrew Dixon,
group product manager for Office at Microsoft. ``Right now, we are
working on testing a solution and steps for customers to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The new flaws also raise troubling questions about Microsoft's
decision to integrate its Explorer web browser directly into the
Windows operating system. That decision is a key issue in the
company's antitrust battle with the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has passionately defended the browser integration,
asserting that it offers significant consumer benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of computer security experts who are familiar with
the newly discovered flaws said that by tightly integrating Web
browsing software with its personal computer operating system,
Microsoft has greatly complicated the challenge of ensuring that

IN WOODSTOCK'S WAKE, SECURITY IS DEBATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ill., Mich., Va.) (yn) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As police investigators delve into allegations of rape and
catalog property damaged by marauding fans at the Woodstock '99
concert last weekend, a debate is emerging, online and among
experts in the concert business, about the performance of the
festival's security force and whether it was adequate.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are Woodstock promoters and many concertgoers, who
contend that the 200,000 young people in attendance were as
protected as they could have been, given the concert's sprawling
site, a shuttered Air Force base in Rome, N.Y. On the other side
are experts on crowd control, who believe that the reported rapes
and Sunday's five-hour melee, which left trailers burning and
vendor stalls looted, could have been prevented.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we had enough security,'' said John Scher,
a Woodstock promoter and the president of Metropolitan
Entertainment Group in New York, which manages concerts for Limp
Bizkit and Korn, two bands whose Woodstock performances were marred
by allegations of sexual abuse and rape in the ``mosh pits'' near
the east stage. ``We met all the permit requirements. But was
anybody prepared for this kind of thing? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   That was precisely the problem, said Paul Wertheimer of Crowd
Management Strategies, a consulting firm in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Woodstock was symbolic of everything that's wrong about
safety at rock concerts,'' he said. Around the notorious mosh pits,
where young men slam against one another as hard-core rap-metal
bands play, Woodstock's yellow-shirted ``peace patrol'' security
forces were nowhere to be seen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the organizers' responsibility to protect people,'' said
Wertheimer, who did not attend the concert but watched portions of
it on television. ``You cannot blame the victims for an environment
they can't control. You don't have to make it perfect, you just
have to take care to prevent injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock organizers should have created a separate area for use
as a mosh pit, which otherwise forms spontaneously directly in
front of a stage, and stationed specially trained security forces
inside the crowd to calm those who veer out of control, he said.
``That could have possibly stopped some of the injuries and also
some of the sexual assaults that went on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the 1,100 security guards should have not allowed
``crowd surfing,'' in which fans get tossed overhead on a sea of
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Donohue, a retired New York City police official who
supervised Woodstock's security force, said it was unrealistic to
think that any number of security guards could have prevented the
four reported rapes, three of which were said to have occurred in
tents on the concert's vast campground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that could have prevented them is having no one
camp there, or a completely lighted area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the teeming, body-crunching acts inside mosh pits,
Donohue said: ``No one is forced into the banging around that they
do there. If you don't want to be in the mosh pit, you shouldn't be
near it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, security guards cannot watch everyone all the
time. ``You make some assumptions that people behave in a normal
fashion at a concert,'' Donohue added. ``You take certain chances,
like you do at a Yankee game. You don't have 5,000 cops inside a
Yankee game.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people at the concert, however, described security as lax.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worthless,'' said Tim Beynart of Athens, Ga., a
Woodstock '99 stage worker, in a telephone interview. With no
security guards around, he and several other crew hands at
Saturday's Limp Bizkit performance were forced to stand guard
around a three-story lighting and sound tower after fans began
tearing it down. ``We were keeping them off the building,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with their rape investigations, the police continue to
account for millions of dollars in property damage. Fans burned 12
refrigerated tractor-trailers, looted concession stands and smashed
into vehicles on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the violence directed at property, only seven people
were injured in the melee.
</P>
<P>
   The human toll from the mosh pits, where dancing was reduced to
jumping and kicking like kernels of stove-top popcorn, appeared to
have been far greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I experienced at the concert, people were friendly
except for the mosh pit,'' said Andrew Mitchell, 21, of St. Louis,
Mich., in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real big guys will form a circle and start kind of beating
on each other. If you get caught in that, you could get a hard
shoulder, a hard elbow; worst case is you get something broken.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Limp Bizkit performance on Saturday, a violent mosh
pit formed a few seconds into the first song, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was almost a stampede back from the stage with people
who were trying to get away from it,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   But to others, the mosh pit is a rough but friendly place where
strangers become friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real strong sense of pit etiquette,'' said Jim
Elliott, 19, of McLean, Va., who joined the mosh pit as Korn, Limp
Bizkit and Rage Against the Machine played. ``If you fall down,
there's always eight or nine hands reaching down to pull you up.
Fights are always broken up after the first punch.''
</P>
<P>
   The rape allegations have sparked a lengthy debate among many
concertgoers who have logged on to the concert's official Web site,
Woodstock.com, to post their insights and opinions on concert
security.
</P>
<P>
   In one posting Tuesday, a man said his daughter had been raped
in a tent on the campground and asked for help in finding the
``clean-cut, college-looking guy'' who did it. Other postings
described how body-surfing women had to fend off swarms of
anonymous, groping hands.
</P>
<P>
   One woman posted a message saying she and a friend had been
trapped in a women's bathroom at the campground after a horde of
men surrounded them and barked requests that they shed their tops.

JUDGE RULES EGYPTIAN LINKED TO TERRORISM SHOULD BE FREED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal immigration judge ruled Friday that an
Egyptian man kept in solitary confinement for the last three years
on the basis of secret evidence allegedly linking him to a
terrorist organization should be freed from jail.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Nasser K. Ahmed, and his lawyers have never been told
exactly what secret evidence the government had on Ahmed, and
contended that he was innocent. Friday, Judge Donn Livingston
agreed, ruling that Ahmed was not a threat to national security and
should, in fact, be given political asylum in the United States
instead of being deported.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was the third case in the last year where immigration
judges have questioned the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
procedures in using secret evidence against suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   In a practice assailed by civil liberties and Arab-American
groups, two dozen suspected terrorists, all Arabs, are being
detained around the country by the immigration service on the basis
of secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   None of the defendants and their lawyers have been allowed to
see the evidence against them. Immigration and intelligence
officials say that the evidence cannot be disclosed because it
endangers the sources of the information and could compromise
national security.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, 38, a father of three, is unlikely to be freed quickly.
Immigration service lawyers filed an immediate appeal of
Livingston's decision that could take months to resolve. Ahmed is
also awaiting sentencing for his conviction in June of making false
statements on an immigration form.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers accused Ahmed of being a follower of Sheik
Omar Abdel Rahman, a blind Egyptian cleric convicted of conspiring
to blow up the World Trade Center and other New York landmarks.
Ahmed served as the sheik's legal assistant during his 1995 trial,
but he vehemently denied being a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers said that the ruling Friday further undermined the
government's use of secret evidence. In such cases, government
lawyers are allowed to present secret evidence and witnesses to
judges in private sessions in the judge's chambers. The defendants
and their lawyers are not allowed to be present and are unable to
rebut any of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the detained men said they were eager to have a
higher court rule on the constitutionality of the use of secret
evidence. But no appeals of an immigration judge's decision have
been ruled on by a higher federal court to date. Livingston, an
administrative judge for the immigration service, was restricted to
ruling on the facts of Ahmed's case only, not on the
constitutionality of the practice.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling Friday, Livingston openly questioned the
immigration service's procedures for calling evidence secret. He
said some of the evidence so declared in Ahmed's case could have
been obtained from unclassified sources, thereby giving Ahmed and
his lawyers the right to know and rebut it.

   The rule was carefully observed in the offseason by the league's
general managers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a dozen NFL teams won more games than they lost. Of
those winners, 10 begin their summer of sweating and grunting with
the same starting quarterback and the same head coach, in several
cases rewarding those men with contract extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The two exceptions are Super Bowl winner Denver, which lost
quarterback John Elway to retirement, and 11-game winner Green Bay,
which lost coach Mike Holmgren to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, 13 NFL teams finished with more defeats than
victories. Of these losers, 10 reacted by changing either their
starting quarterbacks or their head coaches, and five took no
chances and changed their starting quarterbacks and their head
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The teams changing quarterbacks include Washington, whose
problems seemed to reside on defense but which traded for
Minnesota's Brad Johnson shortly before 1998 starter Trent Green
signed with St. Louis; and Cincinnati, another club that might have
concentrated on the other side of scrimmage but chose instead to
release Neil O'Donnell and hope for more points from Jeff Blake and
rookie Akili Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Such mechanical applications of the rule might seem
unreasonable. Why should Green and O'Donnell pay for the outside
linebackers' shortcomings, and for that matter, why should coaches
Ted Marchibroda and Dave Wannstedt be fired because Baltimore owner
Art Modell and Chicago president Mike McCaskey mess up their
franchises?
</P>
<P>
   At least it isn't arbitrary. NFL coaches and quarterbacks can't
claim to misunderstand the terms of their employment. This isn't
about stealing paper clips or sloppy penmanship on the timecard.
</P>
<P>
   Win more than you lose, and you stay. Lose more than you win,
and you're out. The .500 mark cuts like a guillotine.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the league's leading men go to camp this week knowing
that in a front-office supply room, a chopping block is kept oiled
just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo: Can 36-year-old Doug Flutie work magic again? If not,
USC's Rob Johnson is set to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina: Ex-Raider Steve Beuerlein had a solid year but the
Panthers' 4-12 record and the trade for John Elway backup Jeff
Lewis should make him nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit: Does coach Bobby Ross get a pass because of Barry
Sanders' ill-timed retirement? Or does he get blamed for it?
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville: The pressure is on Tom Coughlin _ time to begin
referring to him as ``The Only Coach the Jaguars Have Ever Known''?
_ as he takes over the play-calling for a team many see in the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City: Elvis Grbac gets no break. Rich Gannon may have
gone to Oakland, but 42-year-old Warren Moon can take Grbac's job.
</P>
<P>
   New England: From 11 wins under Bill Parcells to 10 and 9 under
loose-reined Pete Carroll. See where this heads?
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants: Coach Jim Fassell begins the second-to-last
year of his contract, meaning that come January he'll get either an
extension or a summons to the owner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia: No. 1 quarterback Doug Pederson, 31, has been
released eight times and never started a game in his NFL career.
Will he make it through the season before first-round draft pick
Donovan McNabb takes over?
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh: Slash's slide to 26th among NFL passers coincided
with the slip to seven wins. It's a pivotal year for Kordell
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle: Former Barcelona Dragon Jon Kitna replaces the departed
Warren Moon. If the Seahawks slip below their 8-8 records of three
of the past four seasons, it won't be Holmgren taking the fall.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis: Dick Vermeil, who gave us the word ``burnout'' when
he left Philadelphia in 1983, seems intent on inflicting the
condition on Rams players. Trent Green, on the scale of Rams
quarterbacks, rates closer to Karl Sweetan than Roman Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay: Trent Dilfer couldn't get it done in the red zone.
Now he's in the danger zone.
</P>
<P>
   Washington: After four starting quarterbacks in four seasons,
Brad Johnson brings stability to the position. And pressure to
coach Norv Turner, who has broken .500 once in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's it, a win-or-get-out ultimatum for about half the
league's quarterbacks and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Unfair? Not really. In a few cases losing will actually be their
fault.

KARROS IS WORTH KEEPING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's edition of The Sporting Muse, where there is always a
deadline, trade or otherwise:
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers are really looking to improve themselves by
trade, they should consider this power-hitting first baseman whose
name has been mentioned several times as the trade deadline nears.
</P>
<P>
   He averages 25 home runs and 95 RBIs every full season, and he's
also hit for average the last two seasons. He's solid defensively,
is a stand-up guy in the clubhouse, refuses to be a Pollyanna, and
has never told anything but the unvarnished truth when asked about
his team.
</P>
<P>
   By now, you may have guessed I'm talking about Eric Karros, who
is a Dodger and should stay a Dodger for as long as he likes.
Because while there may be a hundred different ways to analyze
what's wrong with the Dodgers, Eric Karros is never part of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the word around the ballpark is that neither General Manager
Kevin Malone nor manager Davey Johnson are fans of Karros, and that
the Dodgers have entertained offers for him and would move him by
today's deadline if they could get the right package of players in
return.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about those reports, Johnson said there have been
rumors about Karros for a long time, that Karros ``was a grinder,''
and that it was disappointing that the team hadn't put things
together.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly gushing praise. At least Tommy Lasorda raved about
guys before telling them to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Malone are good baseball men, and you normally would
assume they know what's best. But based on their work in assembling
and operating the Dodgers of '99, there's no reason to trust them.
And I can trust Karros.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros shows up every day and plays hard. He plays hurt. He
gives you a consistent 25-95 every season with absolutely no fuss
or bother. He has never hid in a bullpen, half-stepped on the
basepaths, or bailed on community work.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes time for the Dodgers to look at themselves in
the mirror, Karros is often the only reflection you can see.
</P>
<P>
   Tell him his numbers say he's done his job and he'll say that
doesn't matter. He resists any attempts at positive spin, even
during short term success, in a disappointing season. Ask him about
Mike Piazza and he'll tell you the Dodgers shouldn't have made the
trade. And that chemistry wasn't the issue three years ago any more
than it is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people said break it up, and maybe those people were
wrong,'' said Karros. ``A lot of people said it was the chemistry,
and it wasn't. Each season we've had different kinds of endings,
and you can't look at any one thing and say `oh, this is the
problem.'
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that winning solves everything, and it's what we
haven't done.''
</P>
<P>
   All I know is that trading Karros won't solve a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Boston and Toronto were interested in Karros, but both teams
made smaller deals this week to fill their needs, Boston getting
Butch Huskey and the Blue Jays David Segui.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has also expressed interest since injuries has left them
with a bit of a power void. But they fully expect Andres Galarraga
to return next season. Karros is signed through 2000 and is in the
$5 million-a-year zone. ...
</P>
<P>
   Two thoughts come to mind while watching the Carlos Perez
fiasco. His outrage at being send to the minor leagues is exactly
what one would expect of the overpaid modern player who believes
his salary makes him invulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   And he would likely be picked up by another major league team as
soon as the Dodgers released him, mostly because he's left-handed
and teams are willing to overlook anything for a left-handed
pitcher. ...
</P>
<P>
   Malone spent most of the week on the phone, but he may not have
been looking to make a trade as much as dump salaries. What he
found out is that no one wants the Dodgers he and others overpaid
to get or keep.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was most interested the Dodgers young pitchers -- Chan
Ho Park, Darren Driefort, Ismael Valdes -- or Karros. No one wanted
Eric Young, Jose Vizcaino, Devon White, Todd Hollandsworth or
Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say that Malone was willing to discuss Gary Sheffield
and Raul Mondesi, too, but their salaries ended most conversations
quickly. ...
</P>
<P>
   Some Angels fans are probably bummed that the team was so
willing to trade Omar Olivares and Randy Velarde for three
prospects. But both are free agents next season, and they're not
the kind of players you build a team around.
</P>
<P>
   That said, any package for Chuck Finley better have more in it
than prospects. Finley is the kind of player who can make a
difference in a pennant race, which is why the Indians and Yankees
want him. They should pay accordingly. ...
</P>
<P>
   The same sources that said the Dodgers were willing to talk
about Sheffield and Mondesi say the Angels have mentioned Darin
Erstad, Garret Anderson, Jim Edmonds and Troy Glaus in trade talk
with other teams. ...
</P>
<P>
   How nice of Jack McDowell, who has spent most of his Angels
career on the disabled list, to say that he hopes his two recent
starts will get him traded to a contender. ...
</P>
<P>
   The trade deadline consumes baseball talk, but the reality is
few of them make a short-term difference and some teams come to
regret their impatience.
</P>
<P>
   Texas won a division after making deals last year, but I'm sure
they wish they could have Fernando Tatis back from the Cardinals.
...
</P>
<P>
   Here's an ugly thought. Tony Gwynn has just two home games left
before the start of an 11-game road trip, so he's likely to smack
hit No. 3,000 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   His first stop is a four-game series in St. Louis, a great
baseball city. But the next stop? Montreal for four games, meaning
Gwynn may very well get No. 3,000 before a crowd of 2,500.

COMMENTARY: THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT FOR FUN AND PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS to former lyricist for the Grateful Dead in graf
beginning: For starters...)  (lh) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ But enough about him. What about me?
</P>
<P>
   Now that the John F. Kennedy Jr. marathon is officially over,
just in time for the new American Tragedy at Buckhead, this much is
clear: After two weeks of wallowing in his life and death, we know
no more about him than we did at the start. Nice guy.
Unpretentious. Handsome. No genius, but smart enough. On the other
hand, we learned far too much about those who exploited the
accident that killed him, his wife and his sister-in-law as an
opportunity for self-promotion and profiteering. With days of TV
and pages of print to fill and no news to fill it with, they just
couldn't stop countering the vacuum by talking rapturously about
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At the high end, if we can call it that, were otherwise
intelligent media hands eager to let us know, often in the first
paragraph of their articles or TV visitations, that they were zero
degrees of separation from the lofty celebrity to whom they paid
ostentatiously lachrymose tribute. ``When he was thinking of
launching George, we had lunch at a tiny Thai restaurant,''
confided Walter Isaacson in one of the two Time installments,
accompanied by synergistic CNN cameo appearances invoking his
palship with Kennedy. ``When my wife and I first had dinner with
him some years ago, he talked to her about Egypt ...'' wrote Lance
Morrow, also in Time.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Brinkley, the historian whom Slate magazine's David
Plotz has now immortalized as ``the William Ginsburg of the Kennedy
death circus,'' told us in Newsweek of ``lunches at New York's
Century Club or EATS Cafe,'' while Jonathan Alter, two pages later,
broke into the first person in his second sentence solely to
advertise his intimacy with the Caroline Kennedy-Edwin Schlossberg
nuptials. Tom Brokaw opened his TV Guide reminiscence with: ``John
and I didn't hang out a lot, but we ate dinner from time to time.''
Christopher Hitchens' air-kiss in Salon began: ``At a cocktail
party in the George Hotel in Washington about a year ago, I was
talking to John Kennedy. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Were these lyrical evocations of the departed prince (or icon,
or whatever) an homage to ``Camelot'' or Zagat?
</P>
<P>
   Less palatable still were the out-and-out vultures, the
hypocrites and the cluelessly tasteless. Bob Morris, a writer who
was at Brown with Kennedy (but ``didn't know him personally''),
parlayed a single recent phone conversation with him into a CNN
appearance, which he then spun off into a confessional for The New
York Times about his guilt over it all. Mike Barnicle, the
disgraced former Boston Globe columnist on the prowl in Hyannis for
career rehabilitation, became Kennedy's most ardent and
God-invoking eulogist on MSNBC _ even though he had lambasted JFK
Jr. in print less than two years ago for having ``the body of Joe
Piscopo and the brain of Sonny Bono.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle's current newspaper boss, Mortimer Zuckerman of The New
York Daily News, bad-mouthed George's advertising prospects on
MSNBC while framed by a news bulletin announcing the discovery of
Kennedy's corpse. On Fox the Rev. Jerry Falwell declared, ``I'm
admittedly much like John Kennedy Jr. in that all my life ... I've
lived close to the edge.'' Also on Fox, the movie critic Michael
Medved, backed by a shot of St. Thomas More Church, offered the
esthetic insight that if Kennedy's cousin Patrick, a congressman,
had been killed he wouldn't have merited so much TV coverage
because he wasn't as good-looking.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of such spectacle, the media consciences Don Hewitt
(of ``60 Minutes'') and Steve Brill (of you-know-what) have both
called for the press to be more respectful of the privacy of
celebrities _ though not until after ``60 Minutes'' had done its
Kennedy show and Brill had shared content-free reflections on his
encounters with his famous fellow magazine publisher on ``Larry
King Live'' hours after the plane was reported missing. The
invasion of celebrities' privacy is the least of the problem,
anyway. What was most disturbing about the Kennedy miniseries was
the shameless, unapologetic manufacturing and fictionalizing of
news, and not just by the veteran fictionalizer Barnicle (whose
report of a grief-stricken midnight sail by Teddy Kennedy had to be
retracted by his network).
</P>
<P>
   For starters, almost all of those who passed themselves off as
Kennedy chums in print and on TV, often referring to him on a
first-name basis, were imposters or grandstanders. Kennedy's
friends, many of whom are not famous, say that of all the
self-identified Kennedy acquaintances gabbing about him, the only
ones actually in their circle were Christiane Amanpour and the
ubiquitous John Perry Barlow, former lyricist for the Grateful
Dead. That garrulous pair excepted, Kennedy's many real friends
remained silent because, as one typically puts it, ``We didn't
violate his privacy in life, so why would we do it in death? We'd
only want to speak up if his portrayal was inaccurate _ but it's
all been so glowing. Those who are now asking to be viewed for
posterity as a first friend are asserting themselves the way they
couldn't when John was alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only were there falsified characters in this drama but
invented plot lines _ from the phantom flight instructor on the
plane, to the fictive fairy-tale mansion the couple was allegedly
building in New Canaan, Conn., to the bogus rivalry between Kennedy
and Hillary Rodham Clinton over the New York senatorial nomination,
to the vilification of Lauren Bessette and her bosses at Morgan
Stanley as the cause of the plane's tardy Friday evening departure.
Such touches recalled the false leads of the All Monica orgy, as
did the elaborate coverage of an event we couldn't see: The
off-camera Manhattan memorial mass was presented as ``live''
breaking news in the same manner as the off-camera grand-jury
testimony of Bill Clinton, complete with static visuals and chatty
color commentary.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying premise driving the Kennedy coverage _ that
America was mourning at a degree to rival the aftermath of either
Kennedy assassination _ may also have been somewhat of a
contrivance. Yes, most people were sad about these unnecessary
deaths _ who wouldn't be? Yes, those citizens who sincerely revere
the Kennedy family were no doubt heartfelt in their public
expressions of sorrow about this latest loss. But was the country
grieving at a scale and intensity to suspend all other news for a
week? Unsurprisingly, the Gallup Poll already shows that Americans
over 60 were most affected, and that nearly 60 percent of the
country found the coverage excessive, no doubt because they sensed
they were being toyed with.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst `John Garfield is still dead' story I've
ever seen,'' says the screenwriter William Goldman, referring to
the joke headline a reporter supposedly suggested to his editor
back in 1952 when the tabloids were running out of angles to
sustain the days-long coverage of the actor's death in mid-coitus.
It's not likely to be the last, for marathon mourning is now a hit
show-biz formula for generating ratings and newsstand sales, with
conventions that have nothing to do with the Greek and
Shakespearean tragedies commentators constantly cite but that are
richly redolent of afternoon soaps: the treacly theme music, the
cheesy greeting-card-art graphics, the New Age vocabulary of
``closure,'' the ritualistically repeated slo-mo video clips (the
3-year-old John's salute, Princess Diana's departure from the
Ritz). Though some cynics wonder if there is any celebrity left,
short of an American president, whose missing plane could sustain
this treatment, let us not forget the milking of the non-celebrity
carnage of Columbine. ``I think I'm going to start a Mourning
Channel,'' says the mordant Hollywood satirist Larry Gelbart. ``All
death all the time.'' If so, he'll have competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Now that this latest binge is over, it's hard not to feel empty
and befogged. Marathon mourning does not mean that the dead will be
better remembered. In England, where what British journalists have
labeled ``Diana fatigue'' is setting in, tickets for the permanent
memorial at Althorp now go begging. The best that can be said of
our latest epic cortege, perhaps, is that against all odds John F.
Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette and Lauren Bessette did not lose
their dignity along with their lives. The same cannot be said of
the living who made a spectacle of their deaths and grabbed the
starring roles for themselves.

DESPITE VARIETY OF CHALLENGES, VIDEO STORES ARE ALIVE AND WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Ever since Blockbuster Video stores started
rolling over America in the 1980s, independent operators have
scrambled to come up with new ways to stay competitive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because Blockbuster doesn't carry adult titles, for example,
some independents do as a way to survive. Indeed, X-rated titles
and a variety of other niche products have become lifelines for
many independent video stores. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster's goal is to own 50 percent of the video rental
business in America, and it's making gains. In the first six months
of this year the video behemoth gained five points of the market
for a total of 31 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, national chains, primarily Blockbuster and Hollywood
Video, added about 1,000 stores. Meanwhile, 2,500 independents
died. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many of us left,'' said Brian Mossman of the Fine
Arts Theatre and Video in Mission, Kan., in suburban Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like most independent operators, Mossman has a niche. He is
unique in this area in that his video ``store'' is in the lobby of
his theater, which shows independent, art and foreign films. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of his video stock consists of the same types of titles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't spend much on advertising because my video customers
are my movie customers,'' Mossman said. ``They come a few minutes
early, browse the videos and then see a movie.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Valentine Video in Westport, a stone's throw from a
Blockbuster, adult videos comprise more than half of the store's
rentals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine competes in other ways, too, says film buyer and
co-manager George Robertson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We carry, obviously, mainstream titles but also alternative
titles, cult movies, foreign films, and recently we started a
director's section, which has been real popular,'' Robertson said.
The director's section groups movies by directors, such as Woody
Allen or Robert Altman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And unlike in a Blockbuster store, Robertson added, he knows
most of his customers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Hollywood at Home, said Steve Wolverton,
manager of the Overland Park, Kan., independent video store in
suburban Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood at Home has carried a limited selection of adult
titles for the 20 years it's been in business, but it also has
other niches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it stocks 3,000 magazine titles, carries some
books and has an assortment of cigars and cigarettes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, about 50 percent of our business is videos, while books
and magazines probably account for 30 to 40 and the rest is cigars,
cigarettes and candy,'' Wolverton said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And then there are stores like Lissa's Videos in Kansas City,
Kan., which deals exclusively in Spanish-speaking videos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster declined to comment on its strategies because it's
in the midst of a so-called ``quiet period'' before a stock
offering planned for later this summer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Sumner Redstone, chairman of media and entertainment giant
Viacom, which owns Blockbuster, exulted in a conference call with
analysts earlier this month over Blockbuster's successes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``BrandingWeek recently ranked Blockbuster as the 13th-most
recognized brand in America,'' Redstone told analysts. ``And by the
way, Blockbuster's next biggest competitor, Hollywood Video, also
made the list -- at number 1,932.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Partly fueling those gains were a series of revenue-sharing
deals with studios, which allow Blockbuster to buy a video for
about $7 a copy while independents still have to pay from $60 to
$85. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That gives Blockbuster the ability to stock dozens of new
titles, while the independents can afford only two or three. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the horizon for all video stores is video-on-demand, whereby
moviewatchers will be able to download a movie off the Internet or
through their television cable system onto a disc and watch it at
their convenience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Will that technology kill the video rental industry?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good question, but who knows where we'll be 10, 15
years from now,'' said Mark Holmes, an associate analyst with A.G.
Edwards. ``For the high-tech user, maybe they'll quit going to
rental stores, but I don't think everyone will.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, VCRs continue to sell well. In the first six months of
this year, 13.8 million VCRs were sold, compared with 10.7 million
in the same period last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is that prices have dropped and people are
either replacing older VCRs or adding more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Noting the still-strong sales of VCRs, Redstone quipped to
analysts, ``and these people aren't buying them to wash their
clothes.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The more immediate issue for the video industry: DVDs. For the
first six months of this year, 1.3 million DVD players were sold,
compared with 283,000 in the first half of 1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, many video stores are starting to stock DVD titles,
including 500 of the 6,500 Blockbuster stores. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even though 2 million households now own DVD players, video
rentals grew 9 percent last year, with Americans spending a record
$8.1 billion renting movies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Will DVDs someday replace videocassettes?'' said Holmes of
A.G. Edwards. ``Maybe. But it will take a long time. It took years
after the release of compact discs to replace albums and cassette
tapes are still out there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wolverton of Hollywood At Home said he doesn't fret
about video-on-demand. &QL;

   ``They've been talking about it for the last 10 years and it's
still not here,'' he said. ``It will surely make a difference, but
until then, I'm not going to worry about it.'' &QL;

UNHERALDED SEKULOV MAKING NAME FOR HIMSELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There were fans in the Mercedes-Benz Cup
grandstand who wondered about James Sekulov. ``What kind of name is
Sekulov? Where's he from?''
</P>
<P>
   The name is Russian, but Sekulov is from Perth, Australia, and a
veteran of the same tennis academy that produced Todd Woodbridge
and Mark Woodforde.
</P>
<P>
   And today he plays in his first ATP Tour semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Sekulov, ranked 236th in the world, had never even won a match
in any of his previous seven ATP events until this week, but now he
faces second-seeded Pete Sampras in today's semifinals after
beating Michael Chang 2-6, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is a 22-year-old who originally planned to take
this week off and ``hang out with friends somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead he entered the qualifier last week and won his way into
the main draw, He earned his first ATP victory in Monday's first
round over Martin Damm. On Wednesday, he upset fifth-seeded Thomas
Enqvist, a two-time L.A. finalist. Then he beat Chang, ranked 70th,
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would've thought I'd beat Enqvist? Who would've thought
I'd beat Chang?'' Sekulov said. ``Of course, I did. You guys
didn't. I thought I had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Since turning pro in 1995 Sekulov has spent most of his time in
Futures and Challenger events, without the benefit of a full-time
coach because ``It's expensive to go out and get one full-time and
there's not a lot of money in Challengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he gets Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 22, 23 this year,'' Sekulov said. ``I haven't done much,
but you've got to take a chance when you get it. I'm in the semis.
Everyone in the semis is playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Down on his luck: Chang continues to struggle. Injuries to his
knee and wrist last year left him out of the top 20 for the first
time since 1988. His confidence continues to be low, which was
evident when Sekulov went up 5-2 in the third set. Chang appeared
downcast throughout the changeover and into the start of the final
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to lose matches like this,'' he said. ``This year
I've lost more than I've won, which is a strange feeling for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chang, who won this event three years ago, refuses to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   Aussies on rise: Joining Sekulov in the semifinals is countryman
Andrew Ilie, who beat France's Anthony Dupuis 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-4
in the day's first quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   Sekulov said he got a charge out of Australia beating the U.S.
in the second round of the Davis Cup two weeks ago. And Australian
Pat Rafter ascended to the top of the world rankings this week.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't rank: Ilie thinks he'll catch grief from the other
players, but he's not a fan of the new ranking system.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Jan. 1, there will be two rankings: the current one,
which will be used for entry and seeding, and a new one. All
players begin the year 2000 with a zero ranking and earn points
based on how they fare in the Grand Slams, the Mercedes Super 9
series (that includes next week's Canadian Open) and any five other
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a lot of rankings confuses the players,'' Ilie said.
``The simpler the better, that's my opinion. It's a little bit
silly. `I'm ranked 40th, 15th and 25th.' You do an average and
we'll be ranked nothing. If it works, don't change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most players either don't care or aren't sure how the rankings
will work.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ilie's ranking, he might worry less if he continues this
successful run. Today is his second semifinal this year.

NOW THAT I KNOW: HAIL TO GEORGE W.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
Once upon a time _ and this starts like a fairy tale because it
seems so long ago and far away _ I didn't particularly care for
George W. Bush. That has suddenly made me a popular guy in some
parts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never mind that those feelings had no real basis, or that they
were developed before I got to know the man, or that I've since
done a 180-degree turn on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody _ ``anybody'' _ who ever said anything critical about
Bush is currently in demand.
</P>
<P>
   True story: Phone rings at the house a few weeks ago. I'm home
on an off-night cooking steaks on the grill. Female voice on the
other end says, ``Oh, you're not here.''
</P>
<P>
   Where, I asked, is here?
</P>
<P>
   ``Here at The Ballpark,'' she said. ``We thought you'd be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice on the other end of the phone belonged to a TV
producer for a national cable sports network. She and her crew were
doing a special on former Rangers' owner George W. Bush, now Texas
governor and presidential hopeful, and they were ``looking for
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Balance? OK, I'll bite. What kind of balance?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody we talk to raves about George W. Bush,'' she said.
``We saw your quotes in ``Texas Monthly'', and, well, we thought,
here's at least somebody who hasn't always liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold it right there. It's true: I did have kind of a
circumstantial grudge against George when he bought the Rangers
back in 1989. I just figured he was coasting on his father's name
and that that's why then-commissioner Peter Ueberroth had approved
his group, once it paired up with Richard Rainwater and Rusty Rose.
George wasn't putting all that much of his own money in, and I
believed, at the time, that there were other groups that might have
merited as much or more consideration.
</P>
<P>
   I was probably also at least vaguely affected by my faint
political leanings: Yes, I'm one of those hated left-wing media
liberals who believes in helping the poor and the elderly, women's
rights, animal rights and protecting the environment. So sue me.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of Bush and Rangers' ownership, however, let's just
say I was dead wrong on all counts. One of those big 0-fers, if you
will.
</P>
<P>
   The TV producer remained adamant despite my disclaimers. Would I
mind coming to The Ballpark that night (the game had already
started). Yes, I said, I would mind. Could they send a crew to my
house then? OK, but it's a 45-minute drive to Johnson County, and
that's if you know where you're going. Plus, it's about to get
dark.
</P>
<P>
   Directions? Sure.
</P>
<P>
   They never showed, which is just as well. I doubt I'd have been
able to provide the kind of balance they seemed to need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet, on average, I talk to somebody in the media three
times a week, calling about George,'' former Rangers' president Tom
Schieffer said a few days later when I told him about the phone
call. ``Now we're kind of into the questions going beyond the
ballpark and baseball. It's things like, `What kind of executive is
he? What kind of person is he? How does he function?'''
</P>
<P>
   I'd often wondered how Bush and Schieffer, who served three
terms in the Texas House of Representatives as a Democrat, were
able to come to a compromise on their respective political beliefs
and work so well together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't, `How do you feel about this issue or that issue.'
Our names had both been on the ballot before, and we'd both been
beaten,'' Schieffer explained. ``There was an instant rapport. We
found the same things to be funny about the lessons you learn when
you're in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   They became close friends, co-workers and confidants, enough so
that Schieffer, surprisingly, will not be at The Ballpark this
weekend for the Nolan Ryan festivities. He and wife, Suzanne, left
Cooperstown, N.Y., on Tuesday to join Bush at his family's vacation
home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Could there be a role for Schieffer in the Bush campaign at some
point? I wouldn't bet against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we agree on all issues? No, we don't,'' Schieffer said.
``But I'll vote for George for president because he is going to do
something because he thinks it's the right thing to do, not because
it's politically expedient. I'll take those kind of politicians in
either party at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer likes to tell a story from this season's Opening Day,
when Bush showed up for the team's luncheon for the Richard Greene
Scholarship program. There was a student there from each of
Arlington's five high schools. Bush, the first one to arrive, spent
time talking individually with each of the scholarship recipients.
</P>
<P>
   As the room filled with corporate executives, Bush got his
plate, located the five kids sitting by themselves in the corner of
the room, and ate his lunch while chatting with them. The students,
naturally, were thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll remember that for the rest of their lives,'' Schieffer
said. ``I thought it was so George Bush, when he could have been
sitting beside the president of this big company or that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like politicians, but there are not many politicians I know
who would have passed the opportunity to schmooze with some big
corporate guy, someone who might mean money in the future. We need
more people in office with that attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't say for sure what kind of president George W. Bush will
make. A pretty decent one, I suspect, because what I learned, once
I gave him a chance, is that he's a good man.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a political analyst, by any means, so, I don't know if
that's enough to be president. There are other issues that will
certainly come into play.
</P>
<P>
   But it would certainly be a refreshing change. nn

NEWEST COWBOY GRATEFUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ In his first interview after his first
Cowboys practice, defensive end Alonzo Spellman was asked, ``What
do you bring to the Cowboys?'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As it turned out, it was the next-to-last question, No. 10 out
of 11, before a club official politely pulled the plug so that
Spellman could take a shower and grab some lunch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I bring?'' Spellman asked yesterday with a weary laugh
that suggested part humor/part exasperation. ``I can stop the run
well. I can get to the quarterback well. I'll be getting into shape
during camp. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see it. ... You'll see.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   [ A man of Spellman's past, it's]It's easy to understand why he
would choose not to talk about anything but the present and the
future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even looking at the past,'' said the 27-year-old
former Chicago Bears first-round draft choice.[ , who] He has been
diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which apparently contributed to
several behavioral problems shortly before and after his June 1998
release from the Bears. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When asked to[ look back and] analyze what has happened to him _
such as barricading himself in his publicist's house during an
eight-hour standoff with police in March 1998, such as having to be
subdued by police with pepper spray when breaking up a fight
between two female companions _ Spellman replied, ``If you're
looking back, there's no way you can walk forward.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Cowboys taking a risk on him, Spellman kept
his composure and said: ``Hey, I'm not worried about that stuff. My
only judges are the guys on the team and the guys upstairs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cowboys are the best place for me right now because they
have so many leaders on the team. They're an established
organization as far as winning goes. They know how to get to the
\RSuper Bowl\S. It's not a place where I would have to come in and
be in a limelight role. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect opportunity in a perfect place.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spellman's Shangri-la is a practice field on the Midwestern
State University campus[ in a town of 136,600 people]. Here, in a
span of less than 18 hours beginning Thursday afternoon, Spellman
went from being an unemployed football player to playing defensive
end for the Cowboys behind only a rookie fourth-round draft choice
named Peppi Zellner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kavika Pittman, the Cowboys' incumbent starter at that same
defensive end position, broke at least two small bones in his hand
during a freak accident at practice yesterday. Pittman tried to
break his fall in a dummy drill and ended up breaking his hand. He
is expected to be out three to four weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spellman's window of opportunity just cracked opened a little
wider. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for Spellman playing behind Zellner, who has been impressive
in this camp but is a rookie, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said,
``We'll just have to evaluate that as time goes on.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for what Spellman showed in his first two workouts, Cowboys
defensive-line coach Jim Bates was encouraged and impressed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not in the best of shape now, not in football shape, but
he gave us some good solid work for a first day'' since he played
in 1997, Bates said. ``He's strong. He's got long arms. He can play
with leverage. He did everything we asked of him today.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys know that if Spellman can keep himself on track,
physically and emotionally, they have a steal. Spellman signed a
one-year deal for the NFL veteran minimum of $400,000, no signing
bonus, with a hard-to-earn incentive package worth another
$400,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My desire to play has been there since I came into the
league'' in 1992 as the 22nd draft pick overall, Spellman said. ``I
just ran into a whole lot of problems, and they're behind me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware that both Spellman's mother and fiance were in attendance
for Spellman's first day as a Cowboy, Calvin Hill, who heads the
Cowboys' behavior program for players, pointed out that Spellman's
``support system'' is one strong indication that he has a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me,'' Hill said, ``I've been here for a couple of years,
and I've seen some cases _ mostly draft choices _ where you say to
yourself, `Wow! This scares you.' But in \RSpellman's\S case, the
red flags that typically come up ... did not come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a nice, young man who has had some problems in the past.
We think we have some things in place that can help him. I just ask
people not to rush to any judgments. Let him be a player again.
Give him a chance.'' nn

YANKEES THRASH BOSTON, 13-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The '99 New York Yankees have lapses like the '98
Yankees almost never experienced. When these Yankees play
second-division teams like the Chicago White Sox or the Florida
Marlins, the monotony wears on them; their intensity wanes.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox will never benefit from this, however. With
the Yankees' big-game adrenaline pumping, they began Friday night's
game with back-to-back home runs from Chuck Knoblauch and Derek
Jeter and went on to thrash Boston, 13-3, as club executives
discussed a handful of trades.
</P>
<P>
   With just a day remaining before Saturday's midnight trade
deadline, the Yankees agreed in principle to a trade for Jim
Leyritz of San Diego; they were mulling the idea of sending Andy
Pettitte to Philadelphia for three prospects; they were bartering
for Baltimore's Arthur Rhodes, and they remained in serious pursuit
of Roberto Hernandez of Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens, a longtime member of the Red Sox, will make his
first Fenway Park start as a Yankee on Saturday, when he faces
Boston's Brian Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox (55-47) are barely hanging on in the American League
East race, 7 1/2 games behind the Yankees and staggered from the
scary shoulder soreness experienced by the ace Pedro Martinez and
season-ending elbow injury to the closer Tom Gordon. If Boston
harbored thoughts of ambushing the Yankees this weekend and
creeping back into the race, the Yankees quickly squashed them.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch had not been expected to play Friday night after he
had been sidelined in Chicago by a virus. But the medication he
took before getting on the plane Thursday helped him greatly, and
before the game, he said he felt much better. It showed, as he
finished with five hits.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch slammed the second pitch of the game from Mark
Portugal into the net above the fence in left-center field, and
right away, the Red Sox fans began murmuring. Their angst grew when
Jeter followed with his 19th home run, into the Boston bullpen
beyond the short wall in right-center field. It was the first time
since April 27, 1955, that the first two Yankees batters had
homered; Hank Bauer and Andy Carey began a game against the Chicago
White Sox with successive homers. Jeter's home run matched his
career-high total set last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu (8-3) took a 2-0 lead to the mound in the bottom of
the first, with great reason to believe he was going to win his
seventh consecutive decision. But he appeared to be having trouble
with the mound: Irabu kicked at the dirt in front of the pitching
rubber constantly, working at the hole left by Portugal in the top
of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's John Valentin hit a home run with one out, and with two
outs, Troy O'Leary doubled to score Nomar Garciaparra, tying the
game, 2-2. But then the Yankees blistered Portugal in the second
inning, in a rally prolonged by Boston errors.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra booted Shane Spencer's ground ball before Scott
Brosius singled and the Yankees were on a roll: Knoblauch hit a
ball off the third-base bag, a single that allowed Spencer to
score, Jeter singled home another run and Portugal was relieved.
</P>
<P>
   But Jin Ho Cho, following Portugal, couldn't slow the Yankees.
When Paul O'Neill flied to deep right, Knoblauch tagged up and
scored _ and when Trot Nixon's relay escaped Donnie Sadler's grasp,
Knoblauch waved frantically for Jeter to follow him across home
plate. The Yankees were ahead, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu was still kicking at the dirt when he came out for the
second inning, and he walked the first two Boston batters. Then
Irabu (12 strikeouts) found his stuff. He struck out Nixon and
retired the next two batters.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees added three runs in the third inning, Jorge Posada
hitting a run-scoring double, the first of his three-extra base
hits, and soon Cho was gone. By the seventh inning, manager Joe
Torre had begun taking out some of his starters.

BEFORE IT MATERIALIZES, CONGRESS ALREADY HAS PLANS TO SPEND THE
SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CHANGES expenditures to revenues in graf beginning: The White
House Budget Office...) (With TAX-CONGRESS.) 
(th) 
 By TIM WEINER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is primed to break its own rules and spend
the $14 billion budget surplus promised for next year, according to
senior members of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to spend billions more on the military, dubious of
cutting domestic programs any deeper and driven to finance members'
favorite projects in all 50 states, Congress already has proved
itself unable to live within the strict budget limits it imposed in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Those spending caps helped balance the budget, but they are now
squeezing too tight, members say. Congress broke the caps in a
last-minute $21 billion spending spree last year, declaring the
money ``emergency'' spending.
</P>
<P>
   Congress seems so likely to exceed the caps again this year that
Republicans and Democrats are now saying that they must rewrite the
law and lift the caps in order pass the spending bills required to
run the government. If the bills do not pass by Sept. 30, a
government shutdown looms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to change the law'' that set the caps, said Rep. John
E. Porter, R-Ill., a senior member of the House Appropriations
Committee. Many Republicans and Democrats in both houses of
Congress agree.
</P>
<P>
   But if the caps are lifted, members are ready with more than $20
billion in new spending programs. That would create a budget
deficit next year _ and that, in turn, could call into question
Republican plans for a tax cut in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the caps still make sense, Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., the
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, took a long pause
and let out a deep sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good question,'' he said, and changed the subject.
</P>
<P>
   If the limits remain, Congress will have to cut billions of
dollars deeper into domestic programs next year and the year after
that. Under the caps, it slashed nondefense spending by 11 percent,
or about $26 billion, this year.
</P>
<P>
   The caps brought federal spending on government agencies down to
$538 billion for the coming fiscal year. Congress will give half to
the Pentagon and divide the rest among every other federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   The strict spending limits, the Republicans say, will put the
federal budget about $14.5 billion in the black next year, not
counting Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican tax cut plan would take $4.5 billion out of
next year's anticipated surplus. That would bring it down to about
$10 billion. And members are already poised to spend that money,
and more.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders are scouring the entire federal budget,
seeking unspent billions from mandatory programs like Medicaid,
welfare benefits and interstate highway funds to try to find more
money that could legally evade the limits on domestic spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``A million here, a million there, maybe it'll add up and nobody
will notice,'' said John Feehrey, spokesman for Speaker Dennis
Hastert, who along with the majority whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas,
is dictating many of the creative budgetary and spending strategies
being used this year.
</P>
<P>
   They are increasingly resorting to accounting tricks and fiscal
gimmicks to preserve the appearance that both the anticipated
surplus and the strict spending limits will remain intact. Rep.
David Obey of Wisconsin, the House Appropriations Committee's
ranking Democrat, calls that appearance ``a public lie''
promulgated by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are absolutely no rules that govern the budget
process,'' Obey said Friday at an appropriations subcommittee
meeting. ``The rules are whatever the majority leadership says they
are at any given nanosecond.''
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, House Republicans ruled, fought and won in two
procedural battles to declare the $4.5 billion cost of the year
2000 census an emergency, erasing it from the budget's bottom line.
The law says emergency spending must be for ``unforeseen,
unpredictable and unanticipated'' needs; the Constitution says the
census must be taken every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans are also considering delaying billions of
dollars of Medicaid payments to the states due in September 2000.
The fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, so if the payments are delayed,
the Republicans figure they can spend the money in the fiscal 2000
budget and make it up later, in fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really playing with fire,'' said Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo. ``They can't pass the appropriations bills without
going through a lot of gimmickry.''
</P>
<P>
   Those gimmicks, he said, ``will call into question in the
financial communities whether we can handle our financial affairs
here with any credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be attempts to cut domestic spending deeper. The
leader of the most fiscally conservative caucus in the Republican
Party, Rep. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, has already trimmed about $1.7
billion from seven spending bills on the floor, and he says he will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   But others want to put much more money back. The pressure to
break the caps is strong. Republicans, clinging to a tenuous
majority in the House, where all spending bills originate, are
painfully aware of polls suggesting that Americans want increased
social spending more than they want a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans still want a tax cut badly. But, like the Democrats,
they want to spend more, too.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, they added an extra $700 million for veterans, raising
the ante on Vice President Al Gore, who this week announced that
the Clinton administration would seek an extra $1 billion for
veterans' health _ money the House had quietly added days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, senators from farm states are going to seek $9
billion in emergency spending for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Porter said his subcommittee, which finances labor, education,
and health and human services programs, will not approve its
spending bill unless most or all of some $15 billion in cuts are
restored.
</P>
<P>
   And in September, in closed-door conferences where differences
between House and Senate spending bills are reconciled, anything is
possible. A billion here, a billion there, as the late Sen. Everett
Dirksen of Illinois used to say, and the anticipated surplus
disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats and some Republicans now question whether the
projected surplus was ever realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Though its appearance was proudly proclaimed by the nation's
leading politicians, it was always an illusion, the Congressional
Budget Office said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The White House budget office projected that spending would be
$14 billion less than revenues next year, above and beyond
surpluses in the Social Security account.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans looked at the congressional estimate of
revenues, compared it with the president's estimate of spending,
and called the difference a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're keeping two sets of books,'' Obey fumed.
</P>
<P>
   And he pointed to a page in the newly drafted $70 billion
spending bill for veterans, housing and other programs as a sign of
what the spending process has become. Under the heading ``Fiscal
Year 2000 Rationale,'' it reads: ``Copy to come.'' The rest is
blank.

AIRLINE SUED BY PASSENGER IN ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.) (yn) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A passenger accused of hurling a Continental Airlines gate agent
head-first to the floor at Newark International Airport last week
has sued the airline, saying that it was he who had been attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Friday in Superior Court in Essex County,
provides a sharply different version of the confrontation between
the passenger, John C. Davis Jr., and the gate agent, Angelo
Sottile, than the one offered by the authorities at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority police said that Sottile, 50, of Kearny,
N.J., was working at Gate 115 of Terminal C at 9:10 p.m. on July
22, preparing to board passengers on a flight to Orlando, Fla.,
when Davis' toddler darted from the waiting area into a passage
leading into the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Vickie Davis, and a gate agent pursued the girl into
the passageway, the police said, but Davis, who also tried to chase
the child, was stopped because he did not have a boarding pass.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the police report continued, then became enraged and
bear-hugged Sottile, turned him upside down and dropped him
head-first onto the floor. Sottile suffered several fractures of
the spine and neck, as well as head injuries. Davis, 29, of
Fredericksburg, Va., was arrested and charged with aggravated
assault. He was released on $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony J. Pope, Davis' lawyer, said that it was Sottile who had
been the aggressor. Sottile, the lawyer said, did not let Mrs.
Davis follow her child and shoved her to keep her away from the
passageway.
</P>
<P>
   ``John sees this,'' Pope added, ``and says something to Mr.
Sottile to the effect of, `Hey, don't touch my wife.' Then the
ticket agent grabs him around the neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis grabbed Sottile back and they both crashed to the ground,
Pope said. He said that he had photographs showing red finger marks
around Davis' neck.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit does not mention Sottile by name; rather, it charges
Continental with creating ``an atmosphere of heightened and
unnecessary tension'' by failing to train its employees properly.
It also accuses unidentified Continental employees of assault and
battery.
</P>
<P>
   Sottile, who was released from the hospital Friday after neck
surgery, will suffer a permanent 50 percent to 60 percent loss of
neck motion, Continental officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Treacy, a spokeswoman for Continental, called Davis'
lawsuit ``a complete perversion of the facts'' and said many
witnesses saw Davis attack Sottile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continental will expend whatever resources necessary to assure
that Davis is brought to justice and pays for his violence,'' she
said.

BURN BEGINS CRUCIAL SWING THROUGH WEST VS. RAPIDS (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
Burn defender Brandon Pollard admits to not always knowing where
his team stands in the ranks of Major League Soccer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But even Pollard doesn't need reminding of the importance of
tonight's ESPN-televised 7 p.m. game against Western
Conference-leading Colorado (13-5) at the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the guys on our team, the people in the office, everybody
knows the importance and our willingness to come out strong this
weekend,'' Pollard said.
</P>
<P>
   A victory would accomplish several objectives for the 10-10
Burn, which is entering the final 12 games of its regular season.
Perhaps at the top of the list is sparking a late-season revival
against Western Conference rivals. The Burn is 4-8 against teams
from the West, and five of its next six games are intra-conference
matches. Getting a winning streak started could spark crucial
momentum to finish high in the standings and provide the Burn with
some extra confidence in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sets a little precedent, and you definitely think about
sending a message,'' Pollard said. ``You can imagine going into the
playoffs losing all of your games to \Rthe Rapids\S, or one or two
to them. Taking one or both of these next games is mentally and
psychologically important. It's important that we get that edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burn is looking for a turnaround from its past game, a 4-1
drubbing from Columbus that was Dallas' worst loss this year. Even
more disappointing for the Burn was the fact that it came after a
10-day break, which it entered with some confidence after two
convincing victories.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Burn's chances of making the postseason look good.
Dallas and Chicago are tied for second with 28 points, with Los
Angeles one point behind in third and San Jose and Kansas City
trailing far behind.
</P>
<P>
   But making the playoffs isn't what the Burn has in mind. It has
sights set on first _ and knocking off Colorado in the next-to-last
game of the series would be a good start for a strong finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put ourselves in the position where every game now is
critical because we want to be the first-place team,'' Burn coach
Dave Dir said. ``Every game against LA, Colorado and Chicago is
big-time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burn has bitter memories of the 1997 playoffs, when Colorado
swept Dallas en route to the MLS Cup. The Rapids also had their
first victory in seven games at the Cotton Bowl this season, a 2-1
shootout. Colorado then defeated the Burn in regulation, 2-1, the
last time the teams met, in June.
</P>
<P>
   All of those factors have helped stir up motivation against the
Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us in the playoffs, and we felt that we were clearly
the better team,'' Dir said. ``And they beat us in two pretty close
games. The intensity has upgraded since then. But I don't think
they have the same intensity and rivalry toward us that we do
toward them. It will take us knocking them off their perch for that
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rapids could be ripe for a fall. Colorado might be missing
five starters: injuries and absences, including] Midfielders Anders
Limpar (strained quadriceps) and Ross Paule (knee) are injured, and
Paul Bravo, Marcelo Balboa and Matt McKeon will probably be with
the U.S. national team in the Confederations Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect Colorado to hand over its top-place perch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the most points and the best record, and with games
in hand on a lot of teams, teams shoot for you,'' Rapids coach
Glenn ``Mooch'' Myernick said. ``But there's an awful lot of soccer
to be played. We've got to avoid any major slumps, ensure we make
the playoffs, make sure we stay at the top and get home-field
advantage, which we've never had in the playoffs.'' nn

ONCE JUST A BRAWLER, NOW ERIC `BUTTERBEAN' ESCH COULD BE THE NEXT
BIG THING (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE SANCHEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
His Rocky-colored shorts, Mr. Freeze-hairline, jumbo waistline _
and mouth to match _ have made him as much of a fixture on fight
cards as women's bouts and ``Let's get ready to rumble.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the attraction-starved world of boxing set out to invent a
new leading man, the character might look much like International
Boxing Association title holder Eric Esch. You might know Esch
better as ``Butterbean,'' the behemoth seen regularly on
pay-per-view cards, ESPN, USA and Showtime dominating four-round
undercard bouts and challenging Mike Tyson after each victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next to Oscar De La Hoya and Floyd Mayweather, he's probably
the most popular boxer we have,'' said Lee Samuels of Top Rank
Inc., one of the top fight promoters.
</P>
<P>
   During the past five years, however, Esch has evolved from an
undercard sideshow into a mainstay among big-money professional
boxing cards. He still packs some circus attraction that has
resulted in ``Butterbean'' lookalike contests and six appearances
on ``The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But Esch has held the International Boxing Association super
heavyweight title since January 1997 and takes a 48-1-1
professional record with 35 knockouts into a scheduled fight on a
card featuring World Boxing Council super bantamweight champion
Erik Morales tonight in Tiajuana, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to fight Butterbean,'' said Art Dore, Esch's
manager. ``He could fight, get crowds every day if he had to. He's
just the kind of guy who has an appeal in the ring, and people like
him as a nice guy out of it. He never forgot where he came from,
making $12,000 \Ra year\S building mobile homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Esch, who turns 30 on Tuesday, came from Americus, Ga., but
spent his formative years in Jasper, Ala. As a young adult, he
labored eight years as a mobile home manufacturer before being
coaxed into his first Tough Man contest in 1988. Tough Man is more
or less a competitive version of street fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys all dared me to get in and paid my entry fee,'' said
Esch, ``I fought the local champion and won it. It was
unbelievable, the rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Weighing 411 pounds, 11 pounds over the Tough Man weight limit,
Esch endured a two-week diet of butter beans to lose 20 pounds for
his first fight. That's where the nickname comes from.
</P>
<P>
   After winning his first Tough Man title, Esch went on to win 18
National Tough Man Tournaments, and 21 World Tough Man Tournaments
during the next six years. With each title, Esch's reputation as a
Tough Man champion grew, but consequently discouraged potential
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would always sign up on the last day, but once people heard
I was in it, they all dropped out,'' he said. ``Nobody else would
fight me anymore; it hurt competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I decided to go after \RMike\S Tyson.''
</P>
<P>
   But Esch's transition into the professional boxing ring was
anything but typical. He made his professional debut Oct. 15, 1994
with a four-round decision against Tim Daniels and then went on to
put together a string of 15 consecutive victories over the next 14
months. He suffered a technical knockout loss to Mitchell Rose in
New York in December 1995 in his 16th fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired,'' Esch said of his only professional loss. ``I
was fighting almost every other week, and it was too much.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing to Rose, Esch won 19 consecutive bouts before
fighting to a draw against Michael Eaton in September 1997. He won
his fight on a card at Texas Motor Speedway in June, and his most
recent victory was a knockout of Peter McNeely.
</P>
<P>
   As for next step in his boxing career, Esch anticipates a
showdown with Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started I couldn't hold my own with Tyson,'' Esch
said. ``Now, I feel like I can beat him. He's not the same. He
don't box anymore. He's too stupid. He'll try to brawl, and I'll
knock him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Esch's trainer, Murray Sutherland, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tyson of old, now that would be a different story,'' said
Murray, who has trained Esch since 1993. ``Now he \RTyson\S is
brawler. It's very feasible because Tyson is no more than a
four-round fighter, at best, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray's confidence comes from hours of reprogramming Esch into
more than just a slugger.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must remember, he had no formal boxing training, just
brawling,'' Murray said. ``I come along, and say we are going to do
it different, but it took time to develop. Now he's got confidence
in his skill.''
</P>
<P>
   But before Esch takes on Tyson, he must faces challengers eager
to capture his IBA crown. Esch still averages two fights per month
but now commands more than $50,000 per appearance. He recently
built a gym and a home in Jasper where he lives with his wife,
Libby, and their three children. He claims to be an entertainer and
said he has quieted critics by improving his boxing skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more of a boxer, but I'll always be brawler,'' he said. ``
I give the crowd what they want. They can't say nothing no more.''
