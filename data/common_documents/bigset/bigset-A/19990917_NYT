YANKEES BEAT INDIANS, 9-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The New York Yankees' self-examination began last
week, questions about whether they are playing with consistent
intensity or whether the hitters in the middle of their lineup are
relaxed enough to generate runs. Now that they have started winning
again and their insecurity has been soothed, the Yankees can look
around and realize that other teams in the American League aren't
exactly perfect, either.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians might have the league's best record, but
in the first game of their four-game series against the Yankees,
they played with all their pimples and warts in evidence. They
committed four errors and played uninspired through an embarrassing
9-5 loss to the Yankees, who have won three straight games now; the
Yankees (88-58) lead Boston in the A.L. East by four games and they
are one game behind the Indians for the league's best record.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' satisfaction with Thursday night's result may have
been muted when Mike Stanton, their durable left-hander, left the
game in the ninth inning because of a strained back. The Yankees
believe he will miss the next few days, although it is clearly a
worrisome injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who glossed over the depth of this loss by adding
three runs in the bottom of the ninth, are winning their division
by 24 games, but they have issues. Their starting pitching is
entirely right-handed and the Yankees are much better against
right-handed pitching. Cleveland's left-handed relief is a
disaster. And they have been accused of cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Boston played the Indians here earlier this week and the Red Sox
Manager Jimy Williams essentially accused Cleveland of stealing
signs with a camera in center field. Some scouts noticed that when
the opposing catcher signaled for a fastball _ with a flash of a
finger that can be seen from a camera in center field _ a coach in
the Indians' dugout would whistle; there would be no whistle, the
scouts noted, if the signal was for a breaking ball. The scouts
became particularly suspicious when it appeared the Cleveland
batters were anticipating breaking balls from hard throwers, like
Anaheim's Troy Percival.
</P>
<P>
   Williams challenged the use of the cameras and the Indians, who
have long owned a reputation for allegedly operating from the
chapters outside of the rule book, were ordered to cover the camera
for the final two games of the series against the Red Sox. Before
Thursday night's game, Yankees Manager Joe Torre spoke vaguely of
whether he might ask for the center-field camera to be covered
again.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre walked the lineup card to home plate _ something he
almost never does _ and appeared to ask Al Clark, the home plate
umpire, about the camera. Clark then approached Indians Manager
Mike Hargrove, pointing at the camera, and soon it was wrapped in
tan canvas. If the Indians had been guilty of spying, well, their
network was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   They could have used some artificial aid on Thursday night
against Irabu, who threw better than he has in a couple of months,
his fastball 92-95 miles per hour, his splitter veering into the
dirt or breaking over the plate. Torre has asked his players why
they have played badly against bad teams this year. But he has no
complaints about their approach versus the contenders in the
American League. The Yankees seem to go about their business with
greater purpose while facing clubs like the Indians; the hitters
may be guilty of taking home run cuts against teams like Detroit,
but against Cleveland, they appear to bat with heightened
concentration, trying merely to put the ball in play or to work a
walk.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch led off Thursday night's game with an 11-pitch
at-bat against Dave Burba, fouling off six pitches, before popping
out. Derek Jeter slapped a ground ball through the legs of the
third baseman Travis Fryman _ the first error _ and when the left
fielder David Justice slipped to his backside while trying to pick
up the ball, Jeter took second.
</P>
<P>
   Burba slipped a fastball past Paul O'Neill, tried a slider,
which O'Neill bashed deep into the seats in right field. Three
batters into the game and Cleveland trailed by two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu walked Manny Ramirez leading off the fourth, and when one
of Irabu's splitters hung over the plate, Jim Thome blasted it to
the back of the Cleveland bullpen, a prodigious shot of 458 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees broke the 2-2 tie in the sixth, after Bernie
Williams and Tino Martinez beat out infield singles. Williams took
third on a fly out and crossed home plate on Jorge Posada's single
through the middle. Ricky Ledee whiffed, the second out of the
inning, and the weak-hitting Luis Sojo was due to bat.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre went for the killing blow, taking advantage of
September's expanded rosters. With Clay Bellinger and three other
infielders on his bench, Torre inserted Chili Davis as a
pinch-hitter for Sojo, looking for another hit, maybe another run.
Davis responded by ripping a double off the left field wall; with
two out, both runners were moving on contact, both runners scored
easily.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees added a run in the seventh and three more in the
eighth, those coming in an inning that began with Justice loafing
on a ball in left field, to finish off the Indians for the night.

BUSH CALLS TEXAS SHOOTINGS AN `EXAMPLE OF ONE SICK PERSON' 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush cut short a presidential
campaign trip to Michigan on Thursday because of the shootings at a
Fort Worth church. But his position on gun control was largely
unchanged because he said ``there is no government law that will
eradicate hate and evil.``
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example of one sick person,'' Bush said after
visiting with shooting victims and their families. ``This is an
example of where someone's heart became so full of hatred and evil
that he would walk into a church and randomly kill people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this instance, I don't know if government could have done
something to prevent this man from walking into a church,'' said
Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gene Ashbrook, 47, described as an eccentric loner, opened
fire inside Wedgwood Baptist Church on Wednesday during a service
for teen-agers, killing seven people and himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth shooting was the latest in a string of deadly
mass shootings this year. The random shootings _ occurring in
California, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana _ have killed
dozens of people and wounded more than two dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had begun a campaign swing Wednesday in Michigan. The Texas
governor visited an elementary school in Grand Rapids as planned,
but then canceled several Michigan events, including two
fund-raisers and a state Republican get-together, to return to Fort
Worth. Bush was criticized recently for canceling an
elementary-school visit in Rhode Island because of bad weather, but
later attending a fund-raiser there.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also canceled plans to attend a motor car race in New
Hampshire on Sunday so he can attend church in Fort Worth. His
wife, Laura, also scrubbed her campaign schedule. Earlier this
week, Bush had to postpone a major speech on defense policy in
South Carolina because of Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush stuck to his general anti-gun-control stance, he
told reporters in Grand Rapids, ``I really think we should make
sure people who are mentally deranged should not have guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added, however, that passing laws can only accomplish so
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a wave of evil passing through America
now,'' he said.``And as a society we can pass laws and hold people
accountable for decisions they make, but our hopes and prayers have
got to be that there is more love in our society.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush met first with relatives of Ashbrook's victims at John
Peter Smith Hospital before visiting Southwest High School, which
some victims had attended. Bush later met privately with Wedgwood
Baptist Church pastor Al Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters at the school that he returned to Fort Worth
to offer his condolences to the city, not gain political points in
his presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right thing for me to be here,'' Bush said. ``I can't
heal the wounds. But maybe I can comfort one person. Maybe I can
thank one teacher. This is a serious situation that is going to
affect this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr said if Bush had not rushed home
the question would be: ``Why isn't he here?''
</P>
<P>
   After his high school news conference, Bush met and joked with
many of the teen-agers gathered around him who had not been
involved in the shooting. He posed smiling for one picture when a
girl said it was for the high school yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   Before departing Michigan, and again in Texas, he was peppered
with questions about gun control, a hot-button issue that has
caused a headache for many Republicans who have been reluctant to
alienate their supporters while at the same time addressing this
year's shooting sprees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no law _ I wish we could pass it. I would sign it. _
that says people will love one another,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, another Republican presidential candidate who has
become the standard-bearer for social conservatives, suggested the
latest mass shooting revealed a pattern of crimes against religious
people and urged the Justice Department to study the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have criticized Bush for pushing through a law in
Texas that allowed licensed citizens to carry concealed weapons and
for his decision not to urge the Texas Legislature to close a
loophole that allows firearm purchases at gun shows without
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defended Texas's concealed weapons law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a dangerous society, and if people want to protect
themselves, law-abiding citizens want to protect themselves, they
should be allowed to do so,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, the governor has largely echoed the
National Rifle Association position that the problem is not the
lack of tough gun control laws but the failure of authorities to
enforce the current regulation.
</P>
<P>
   He has endorsed a number of minor changes now before Congress,
including closing the loophole that allows guns to be purchased at
gun shows without a background check, and has said he supports the
ban on automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
front-runner, however, pushed once again for more gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing this week's East Coast hurricane and the shooting,
Gore said, ``There are differences between these two tragedies. A
hurricane is something we can't do anything about. It's an act of
God. but the shooting is something that people do to people.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has after the nation's other recent mass shootings, Gore
lamented the easy access troubled people have to guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know that the availability of assault weapons and deadly
weapons in the hands of people who shouldn't have them contribute
to ... having these things over and over again,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He called for requiring licenses for handgun purchases, closing
the gun-show loophole, re-establishing the three-day waiting period
for handgun purchases, requiring child-safety trigger locks,
raising the age of purchase and toughening the penalties for giving
guns to those who should not have them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush once again chided the Clinton administration for not
adequately funding gun-control enforcement programs. Bush also said
that he did not regret that he did not more strongly urge the Texas
Legislature this year to approve a measure requiring background
checks of those who buy handguns at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush initially said he supported the proposal, Texas
lawmakers said he did not lobby for its passage. It was killed by a
Texas House committee.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said a toughened state law would not do any good
until the federal government allows unlicensed dealers who work at
gun shows access to computerized background checks.
</P>
<P>
   While the governor acknowledged the need for some gun control
laws, he preferred to focus on the moral dimensions of the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can pass laws. But there needs to be a higher law and that
is love your neighbor like you love yourself,'' he said.``I
recognize that hate and evil lurk in people's heart and there is no
government law that will eradicate hate and evil. That is going to
require a higher authority, much higher than a humble governor.``

TEXAS GUNMAN LINKED TO HATE GROUP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to correct headline) 
 
By EVAN MOORE 
and JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Larry Ashbrook, the gunman who killed seven
people and himself at a Baptist church Wednesday, identified
himself three years ago as a member of a small, violent group that
advocates killing Jews and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   While police Thursday said they had found no link between the
47-year-old gunman and hate groups, John Craig, co-author of an
academic study of such groups, said Ashbrook in 1996 boasted of
membership in the Phineas Priests.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said that organization was outraged at Southern Baptists
for their efforts to convert Jews to Christianity. At the time of
the church shooting, Baptist churches in Fort Worth were openly
praying for Jewish conversions during the High Holy Days of Rosh
Hashana and Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses to the shooting spree at the Wedgwood Baptist Church
said Ashbrook spewed obscenities and ridiculed the Baptist
denomination before opening fire on 150 teen-agers and adults
attending a youth rally. Ashbrook shot 14 people before committing
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   He also detonated a homemade pipe bomb, but it apparently
resulted in no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about the shootings Wednesday night and I heard
that the gunman was wearing black and killed himself, I knew it had
to be a Phineas Priest,'' said Craig, whose book, ``Soldiers of
God, White Supremacists and their Holy War for America,'' appeared
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called some people I know in the white supremacist movement
and they told me it was Larry Ashbrook.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said he attempted to notify Fort Worth police of
Ashbrook's racist connections and the possible motive for the
shootings Wednesday night, but his telephone calls were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that this is the tip of the iceberg,'' he said.
``There are other Phineas Priests out there and they feed off one
another's actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Phineas Priest members linked to violence include Buford
Furrow, who allegedly shot children in a Los Angeles Jewish day
care center, fugitive Eric Rudolph, the abortion center bomber also
accused in the 1996 Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta, and three men
arrested in a string of bank robberies and bombings in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, a former undercover operative and private investigator
who lives in Houston, said he considers members of the group among
the most dangerous because of their willingness to die in the
process of killing Jews, people of color or anyone who aids those
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are extremely violent loners who don't particularly want
to draw attention to themselves except in death,'' Craig said. ``.
. .He (Ashbrook) obviously had no intention of coming back. He
intended to kill himself and become a martyr to his own kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting Fort Worth Police Chief Ralph Mendoza on Thursday said
authorities had found no link between Ashbrook and hate groups.
But, police and the 47-year-old gunman's neighbors described him as
hostile and paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't like you looking at him,'' said Steve Singer, a
neighbor who frequently passed Ashbrook's house in his car. ``I
would always wave to him and sometimes he would wave back and
sometimes he would just glare at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to harass the kids . . .verbally,'' said Karen Ivy,
who lived two doors down the street. ``He'd yell at them and flip
them off. When they got older, he quit doing that 'cause they
wouldn't take it. One day my son, Robert, and some others had the
car radio on and Larry came down and said, `Turn that crap off.'
Robert told him to get back to his house and stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ashbrook's most open animosity apparently was directed at
Jack and Nita Hord, who lived across the street.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Ivy said, Hord and some other neighbors were sitting on
Hord's front steps, laughing. Ashbrook drove up and, thinking they
were laughing at him, yelled, ``What are you laughing at?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he unzipped his pants and exposed himself to the women.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the neighbors had lived near him for several
years, they knew little about him. He always wore blue jeans, a
white shirt and a gray windbreaker, they said. Usually he carried a
blue canvas tote bag. His beard, they said, was always
``scraggly.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the neighbors knew of any particular religious beliefs
held by Ashbrook, who lived with his father, described as a quiet,
religious man who drove a bus for a nearby Church of Christ.
Ashbrook's father, 85-year-old Jack D. Ashbrook, died July 20, and
Mendoza speculated that could have contributed to his mental
deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said Ashbrook's father supported him.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said the only contact Fort Worth police had had with
Ashbrook was in 1971, when they arrested him for possession of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Police, who searched the house late Wednesday night and Thursday
morning, said they found freshly cut sections of pipe, end caps,
fuse and gunpowder and pamphlets pertaining to religion. However,
there was nothing to suggest his attitude toward religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing he wrote were old items, as far back as the
1980s,'' said Mendoza. ``It was complaints about people, his job.
He believed people were out to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Ashbrook wrote at least two letters to the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram in which he detailed encounters with the
Central Intelligence Agency, assaults by co-workers and being
drugged by police.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said the inside of Ashbrook's tidy frame house had been
trashed with a crowbar and shovel. The toilets had been destroyed
by pouring cement into them.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said Ashbrook had been armed with two firearms. A
.380-caliber handgun had been purchased in February 1992 at a Fort
Worth gun shop, now out of business; the second weapon, a 9mm Ruger
semiautomatic handgun, had been purchased at a flea market in the
Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Danny Rojas, said he and other adults were standing
in a room across the hall from the sanctuary when they heard
popping sounds which they thought was hammering from ongoing
construction work.
</P>
<P>
   But then a church employee came up and said he had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said he went into the hallway where there was smoke
lingering from shots fired before Ashbrook went into the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said he looked through a window into the sanctuary where
his 13-year-old daughter was attending the rally and saw Ashbrook
``walking back and forth, shooting and reloading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him sit down and get back up and walk around some
more.''
</P>
<P>
   He said at one point Ashbrook turned in his direction and raised
his gun. Rojas ducked out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't go in. There was no way of stopping him,'' Rojas
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the gunman walked in the other direction, Rojas rushed over
to a friend, Sydney R. Browning, 36, who was slumped against the
wall in a pool of blood in the foyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get to her. I thought I could help her, but when I
saw how he had shot her, I knew it was no use.'' She had been shot
through the head.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said he then ran upstairs to check on his first-grade son.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said this all took only a few minutes, but it seemed a
lot longer than that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said police found at least 10 magazine clips and 30
spent shell casings on the church floor.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses at the church reported that Ashbrook was cursing
Baptists intermittently during his shooting spree and continued the
diatribe as he sat in a back pew and turned one of his weapons on
himself.
</P>
<P>
   According to statements they gave police, he said, ``This
religion is (expletive) and I can't believe you believe this
junk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It all fits too well,'' said Craig.
</P>
<P>
   A question that remained unanswered Thursday was how and why
Ashbrook chose Wedgwood Baptist as his target. The church was the
scene of a gathering of about 150 youths in the school prayer
movement known as ``See You at the Pole,'' a reference to a
schoolyard flagpole.
</P>
<P>
   The church is not on any main thoroughfare, however, and
Ashbrook was not a member.
</P>
<P>
   As to speculation that Ashbrook was angry at the Southern
Baptist Church for reaching out to Jews, one Wedgwood Baptist
member said that would not explain why he targeted her church.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's every Baptist church's mission,'' said Cindy Hoak, 18.
``The whole Southern Baptist Conference is doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Robertson, 13, said she has been a member of the
church for two years and, ``We never really talked about Jews at
all.''

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
For the second consecutive day, the Dallas Cowboys learned they
would lose a key player for the season, and possibly forever.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fullback Daryl Johnston, who missed most of the 1997 season
after a bulging disk in his neck required surgery, will miss the
rest of the season because of neck problems related to the 1997
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the same as two years ago, but it has the
potential to be,'' Johnston, 33, said Thursday. ``That's why
there's the necessity to sit down this year and try to prevent
that.''
</P>
<P>
   That news came only one day after linebacker Quentin Coryatt
announced he would not play this season because of recurring
injuries that were healing slowly. Coryatt, who signed as a free
agent in the offseason, had not played a down in a Cowboys uniform.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Cowboys no time to make a roster move after finding
former Pittsburgh fullback Tim Lester on the waiver wire. Lester,
who was let go by Jacksonville, worked with Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey when Gailey was the Steelers' offensive coordinator. Lester
served three years as lead blocker for Jerome Bettis. He practiced
with the Cowboys on Thursday and will start Monday night against
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston was placed on injured reserve. The only other fullback
on the roster is Robert Thomas, a second-year linebacker whom the
Cowboys converted to fullback in the final week of the preseason
because they were thin at that position.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's problem was discovered in tests taken Wednesday and
could end his career. A similar neck problem temporarily paralyzed
Cleveland Browns Pro Bowl linebacker Chris Spielman, causing him to
retire during the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a tough decision (retiring),'' Johnston
said. ``That will be considered at the end of the season. The
strange thing is I thought after making it through last season I'd
be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gets in your blood, I guess. I started playing
organized football when I was 8. That's 25 years of my life. I can
look at the things I've accomplished in my life, and a lot of them
are related to the game of football.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson played in only six games in 1997. He underwent surgery
at the end of October that year to fuse two cervical vertebrae. The
procedure left the area above the fused vertebrae vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston had no problems with the neck while playing in all 17
games last season, but he said he had a burning sensation in his
neck after getting hit during Sunday's season opener in Washington.
He underwent an MRI on Wednesday, and the result was compared to a
previous MRI. It indicated he suffered a ``change in disk space,''
Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough for doctors to recommend he not play and be
re-evaluated in six to nine months. Surgery has not been
recommended and is probably unlikely if he retires, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Johnston's return last year that Emmitt Smith credited
for his own improved performance. Without ``Moose'' blocking for
him, Smith rushed for only 1,074 yards and four touchdowns in 1997,
the fewest touchdowns in his nine-year career. With Johnston back
creating holes, Smith saw the end zone 13 times last year while
totaling 1,332 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston was also key in last weekend's victory. On the
game-winning drive in overtime, Smith fumbled on the first play.
Johnston recovered it at the Cowboys' 10. The game was over three
plays later.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston was known as an iron man before the neck injury. He
never had missed an NFL game, playing in 149 consecutive until
being forced to the sidelines in October 1997. In 11 years,
Johnston has rushed for 753 yards and eight touchdowns. He has
caught 294 balls for 2,227 yards and 14 TDs. He had one catch for
four yards last weekend against the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very disappointed, first and foremost for Daryl,''
owner Jerry Jones said. ``He's been an inspiration for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston took a pay cut to remain a Cowboy this season and was
being used in a more limited role. The Cowboys were veering from
the traditional two-back set to offensive schemes with a wide
receiver or a tight end as a lead blocker, or three- and
four-receiver formations with no lead blocker.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough adjustment for Smith, who has had a lead blocker
throughout his football experience and has run behind Johnston for
most of his NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all that pleasant to run up in there when you don't
know what's going to happen,'' Smith said during camp.

FORT WORTH OFFICIALS VOW TO OVERCOME THE HORROR
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Resending to correct name of victim to Kevin Galey, sted
Gailey) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERNIE MAKOVY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In mourning Larry Gene Ashbrook's bloody
carnage _ eight dead, seven wounded in a house of God _ Fort Worth
leaders vowed Thursday that the city will survive while police
worked to solve the puzzle of what drove the reclusive malcontent
to his deadly deed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grieve, but not as those who have no hope,'' said the Rev.
Al Meredith, whose Wedgwood Baptist Church became Ashbrook's
target. ``It's a dark day, it's a heartbreaking day, but in the
worst of our times, for those of us who know Christ, there is
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Kenneth Barr said the city will deal with the tragedy and
move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to let one senseless act of violence define
who we are as a city,'' Barr said. ``People responded. That's who
we are. We are not that gunman.''
</P>
<P>
   A cigarette dangling from his mouth and packing two weapons,
Ashbrook strolled into Wedgwood Baptist Church about 7 p.m.
Wednesday and unleashed terror on 150 to -200 people at a church
youth rally featuring the Christian band Forty Days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all (expletive). I can't believe you believe this
junk, and (are) singing this,'' one witness quoted Ashbrook as
yelling. Witnesses also reported Ashbrook as saying, ``This
religion is (expletive),'' acting Police Chief Ralph Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook then exploded a pipe bomb in a church aisle and
unloaded a barrage of random gunshots that hit 14 people, fatally
wounding seven. Of the survivors, two remain in serious condition.
One of them _ Justin Laird, a high school football kicker _ is
paralyzed from the neck down, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, Ashbrook sat in a back pew of the
sanctuary, placed a gun to his temple and killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   He had two weapons _ a Ruger 9mm pistol and an AMT .380. The
.380, Mendoza said, was traced to a now-closed establishment called
Guns 'n Such, where it was purchased Feb. 15, 1992. The second
weapon was probably purchased at the Traders Village flea market in
Grand Prairie, a Fort Worth suburb, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said now is the time for the church and community to
remember their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts' desire is that the King of Darkness will not
prevail,'' the pastor said. God ``weeps with those who weep, he
grieves with those who grieve and he knows what it's like to lose a
son.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said that although such a tragedy can happen anywhere, ``I
assure you that yesterday, `anywhere' took on a whole new
meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one particular act by one particular individual who is
no longer living and will never hurt anyone again.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Ashbrook and his victims were removed from the
church by 3 a.m. Thursday after the area was painstakingly searched
of any bombs or other explosive devices Ashbrook might have left
behind. None was found.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that Ashbrook had an accomplice or that
he was involved with hate groups, Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any specific information as to why he committed
this crime,'' Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what is so puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we would have to venture a guess that it was
random,'' Mendoza said. ``For me to understand him, I would have to
be abnormal, and I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Police identified the slain victims Thursday as Shawn C. Brown
and Susan Kimberly Jones, both 23 and seminary students; Cassandra
Griffin, 14; Joseph D. Ennis, 14; Justin Ray, 17; and Kristi
Beckel, 14, all four students; and Sydney Browning, 36, the
church's choir director.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded were identified as Laird, the football player;
Robert Debord, 17; Mary Beth Talley, 17; and Nicholas Skinner, 14,
all students; Jeff Laster, 36; and Kevin Galey, 38.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Parr, 14, a junior at Southwest High School in Fort Worth,
was initially misidentified as one of the victims. He was not at
the church during the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, police searched Ashbrook's home for anything
that might indicate why he went on his rampage.
</P>
<P>
   They were more stunned by the condition of Ashbrook's home than
by the evidence they found inside.
</P>
<P>
   Toilets were plugged with concrete, motor oil filled shower
heads, walls were bashed in and Bibles and family portraits were
shredded, homicide Detective Curt Brannan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared as someone in that house was in a violent rage.
This person destroyed and shredded what many people would cherish _
family photos, possessions of deceased loved ones, the holy
Scriptures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Bob Garrity Jr. said the search revealed a freshly
cut pipe, a hacksaw, black powder, and empty boxes for 9mm and
.380-caliber ammunition. Writings included anti-religious
statements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had trashed his house. Furniture was thrown about, tipped
over. There were big gaping holes in the walls, family photographs
down and broken and faces cut out of the photographs,'' Garrity
said.
</P>
<P>
   Garrity said evidence indicates that the concrete Ashbrook
poured down the toilet had been purchased just hours before the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess, if nothing else, he was making a statement he was not
coming back,'' Garrity said. ``He knew when he left the house, he
was not coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrity said witness statements and the writings found inside
the home indicate that Ashbrook fit the profile of the typical mass
killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mass murderers typically are disenfranchised white males,''
Garrity said. ``They are asocial, loners. They have a very poor
employment history.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that these people do is, they have this
fantasy life. One of the motivators is they fantasize about this
life that they don't lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know if they go out with a high body count, they'll be
remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrity said some of the writings found in the home show that
Ashbrook had a difficult time holding a job and was paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is putting down, `I was fired from this job. They told me
for this reason, but I really know it's for that reason,' ''
Garrity said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and friends described him as a loner who distinguished
himself by his bizarre behavior and penchant for psychedelic drugs
in the early 1970s. He was a troubled child who forced one young
neighbor girl to eat bugs, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook was meticulous in maintaining his yard, even pruning
and tending pear trees in his back yard three hours before his
rampage at Wedgwood Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Berry, 14, said Ashbrook used to mow her family's yard
years ago. More recently, she and her mother often saw Ashbrook
sitting on his front porch watching others.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ashbrook was on the porch about 3 p.m. as Berry
walked past his house to visit a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked kind of sad or distressed, maybe a little angry,''
Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said that five people unaccounted for late Wednesday
night were later identified as being victims within the church.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration companies are on standy to get the church ready for
services Sunday, said an official with the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, beneath a sky dotted with gray rainclouds, the
neighborhood of Wedgwood awoke to a gruesome reality.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and church members began walking by the church, still
blocked off by yellow police tape, and gazed at the scene, knowing
what had happened but not wanting to believe.
</P>
<P>
   About 10:20 am, a blond-haired man made his way through the
throng of camera tripods and milling reporters to a church sign on
the corner of Wales and Walton streets. He gently placed a bouquet
of lilies at the base of the sign and walked away quietly.
</P>
<P>
   The envelope read, ``We Love You!''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, North Texas residents placed silk flowers,
carnations, daisies and a variety of other flowers at the corner
church site.
</P>
<P>
   Cards with ``To Our Angels'' and ``We Love You'' were pinned to
the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Spahr lives in Colorado Springs, near Littleton. Less than
five months ago, his community was rocked by a vicious shooting at
Columbine High School that ended in 15 dead, including the two
teen-age gunman.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart goes out and my love goes out to the families,'' said
Spahr, who was in Fort Worth on business. ``Become one, become a
unit, pull together and love your family,'' he said. &QL;

WEDGWOOD BAPTIST COMMITS TO HEALING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Driven from their church by a disastrous
shooting, about 200 members of Wedgwood Baptist Church wept and
prayed Thursday afternoon at a neighboring church.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bollinger, a layman and Sunday school teacher who called the
prayer meeting at the Hulen Street Baptist Church, told of being
asked by a reporter how the shootings would affect his faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost laughed,'' Bollinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My faith goes on forever,'' he said. ``He was my Lord before
this happened and he is my Lord right now.''
</P>
<P>
   During a prayer, Bollinger said that no one is wise enough or
smart enough to answer all the questions about the shootings that
took eight lives, including the gunman, who shot himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts are broken,'' he prayed. ``But we trust in you and
pray most of all that this event will not have been in vain. Let us
realize that life is short and we need you, Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Meredith, pastor of the church for 12 years, said at
a news conference Thursday that the church will be stronger after
the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith had just returned to Fort Worth after the death of his
mother when he learned of the shooting at his church Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   He lauded the support that his congregation has been given by
the community and also praised law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud of our city officials and the way they responded,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Church members were stunned by the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt numbed; it's like a dream,'' Steve Scott said.
``But we are a very close-knit church. At first, I thought, `Why
us?' but then I thought, `Why not?' If any church has can survive
this, Wedgwood can.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott praised Meredith as a pastor who has molded the
2,000-member church into a family. He said the church has strong
music and youth programs for high school and college students and
classes for singles and older adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lots of (Southwestern Baptist Theological) seminary
students who attend our church,'' he said. Several current or
former seminary students were among the shooting victims.
</P>
<P>
   Church members also go on mission trips to Mexico and other
locations to conduct Bible schools and help build churches and
repair houses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The church has a strong counseling program, led by Kevin Galey,
a licensed counselor and doctoral student at Southwestern seminary,
who was wounded in the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Another church member who attended Thursday's prayer meeting,
Bill Allen, 72, said he has been a member since Wedgwood first
opened as a mission church in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a retired banker, said the congregation has survived many
changes in the Wedgwood neighborhood it serves because Meredith and
other ministers are always around to help people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a long time for us to heal,'' he said. ``But we
will keep on. We are in God's hands.'' &QL;

WOUNDED VICTIMS WERE CUT DOWN AT SONG, PRAYER, WORK

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ They were at the church for different
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   For Jaynanne Brown, it was Wednesday choir practice as usual.
For Jeff Laster, a seminary student, it was another night on the
job as a custodian.
</P>
<P>
   For others, it was an evening prayer service.
</P>
<P>
   For all, it was a busy night at Wedgwood Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   But before the night was over, seven were dead and another seven
wounded _ and a gunman was dead by his own hand.
</P>
<P>
   For Brown, everything happened quickly from the moment she saw a
wild-eyed man walk into the church, puffing on a cigarette. She saw
him reach into his belt and pull out a pistol. She heard a popping
sound and her friend Sydney Browning say, ``Ow,'' before she fell
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then Brown felt blood dripping from the top of her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I'd been hit because there was a very hot feeling,''
Brown said. ``I put my hand up and thought, `Dear Lord, is this how
it feels to die?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose head was grazed by a bullet, fled from the building
as the man headed down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Brown and Laster, five others were wounded in the
attack: Kevin Galey, a counselor at Wedgwood Baptist Church, and
four students, Robert DeBord, 17, Justin Laird, 16, Mary Beth
Talley, 17, and Nicholas Skinner, 14.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded:
</P>
<P>
   Jaynanne Brown
</P>
<P>
   Jaynanne Brown, 41, is not sure whether the bullet that killed
her friend Sydney Browning also grazed her head.
</P>
<P>
   She only knows that all kinds of crazy thoughts raced through
her mind and that she knew her friend was dead.
</P>
<P>
   The shooter had a hard look to his face, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others have said he said something, but I didn't hear him say
anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was treated at Harris Methodist Fort Worth on Wednesday
and released.
</P>
<P>
   So much of the night of the shooting is a blur for Brown, whose
two children were inside the church but were not injured.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a fourth-, fifth- and sixth-grade teacher at Meadowcreek
Elementary School in Fort Worth, said she spent all day going over
the ``what-ifs.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thankful and I know we have to go on from here,'' she
said. ``Now I want to support the families who have lost loved
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert DeBord
</P>
<P>
   Robert DeBord, 17, is a ``nice and polite guy,'' said a former
neighbor who would not give his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd come over here and shoot baskets sometimes,'' the man
said. ``He was real nice and polite and did all the yardwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor said DeBord moved out of his home in Arlington,
a Fort Worth suburb, around Christmas. He worked as a stocker at
Walgreen's on Green Oaks Boulevard and Kelly Elliot Road.
</P>
<P>
   DeBord attended Martin High School last school year. He left
Martin in February.
</P>
<P>
   He was listed in fair condition in the intensive care unit at
John Peter Smith Hospital on Thursday night with a chest wound.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Galey
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the problem, Kevin Galey is the man to whom
church members turn whenever they need help.
</P>
<P>
   Help with marriage problems, teen-age woes, whatever, Galey is
always there, said Terri Gestes, a church member.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always somebody you can go to and you know you'll get the
truth,'' said Gestes, whose daughter Lucy was at the church during
the shooting but escaped unharmed. ``He's somebody I could stop in
the hallway and he would always give me some advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Galey, who was shot in the abdomen, is listed in good condition
at Harris Methodist.
</P>
<P>
   Galey, 38, had several jobs at the church but was there
Wednesday for a prayer meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Crane, who was working in the preschool during the
shooting, said Galey has a good sense of humor and likes to tease
in a good-hearted way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a gentle man. He's jovial,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Galey is working on his doctorate in counseling at Southwestern
Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The father of three and his wife, Leslie, faced a crisis last
year when their youngest son, Joel, had experimental fetal surgery
inside his mother's womb. The surgery was to reduce the chance of
mental retardation and bladder control difficulties that can result
from severe forms of spina bifida.
</P>
<P>
   Galey's children were in the nursery during the shooting. The
baby is doing well, Crane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joel is a real miracle baby,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Laster
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Laster, 36, is a fine maintenance man who keeps the church
building running smoothly, acquaintances said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He works as a custodian while attending Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary, where he is in a program that leads to a
master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   Laster, who moved to Fort Worth from Little Rock, Ark., does
maintenance for the church because he wants to do every job in a
church, said John Roland, a friend who lives down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Laster hopes to work his way up to an administrative position,
Roland said.
</P>
<P>
   Laster, a Republican, loves to debate politics with his friends.
</P>
<P>
   He was listed in serious condition with a gunshot wound in the
abdomen at John Peter Smith hospital in Fort Worth on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Crane, who was working in the preschool at the time of the
shooting, said Laster is always ready to help her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm working, `I just holler, `Jeff, fix this, or move
this,' and he would come,'' Crane said. ``He never got upset; he
was always saying `Sure, whatever I can do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Skinner
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Skinner, 14, was treated at Cook Children's Hospital
and released Thursday. Through his family, he declined to be
interviewed.

CLINTON INVOKES EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IN CLEMENCY PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 16th-18th grafs for additional material on 16 prisoners and
for rewriting) (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing executive privilege, President Clinton on
Thursday rejected subpoenas from congressional Republicans to turn
over records of private deliberations that led him to offer
clemency last month to 16 members of a violent Puerto Rican
nationalist group.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, bolstered by an opinion from Attorney General
Janet Reno, asserted flatly that Congress had no authority over the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pursuant to the Constitution and the separation of powers
doctrine, the President's authority to grant clemency is not
subject to legislative oversight,'' Cheryl Mills, the White House
deputy counsel, wrote to Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who is chairman
of the Committee on Government Reform, which subpoenaed the
records.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Mills said, the White House is spurning the
committee's subpoena for Beth Nolan, the president's new chief
counsel, to testify on the matter. But administration officials
said on Thursday night that three other officials will appear next
week at hearings by the panel although they will not testify to
matters considered confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The White House will release some documents not covered by
executive privilege, but administration officials did not give a
detailed description of them.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans reacted angrily to the rebuff. Burton
accused the president of hiding behind the shield of executive
privilege to avoid giving the public a full explanation of why he
granted clemency to the militants _ a move that Burton said runs
counter to the interests of the United States and its security.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fourth time the Clinton administration has asserted
executive privilege in response to demands from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said in an interview that while the president has a right
to claim executive privilege, he also has a moral obligation to
tell the public why he freed people who were members of a terrorist
organization that killed or maimed nearly 90 people in bombings in
the 1970s and 1980s. None of the 16 prisoners was convicted of
violent acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people deserve an explanation, and he's thumbing
his nose at them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have privately delighted in the political chaos that
the matter has caused for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is almost
certainly running for the U.S. Senate from New York. Mrs. Clinton
at first supported the clemency offer then opposed it, incensing
many Puerto Rican members of Congress. Two new polls show that
large majorities of voters, both nationally and in New York,
disapproved of the clemency offer. And more view Mrs. Clinton's
handling of the episode unfavorably than favorably.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said that even if administration officials refused to
discuss the decision-making process, he would issue subpoenas on
Friday for representatives of the Justice Department, the FBI and
the Bureau of Prisons to appear on Tuesday to provide as much
documentation as they could about the prisoners' backgrounds and
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Several top law-enforcement officials recommended against the
clemency, and Burton wants to get that on the record. He also said
his committee had video tape of two of the prisoners making bombs
in 1983 and that he intended for the public to see that tape.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee also plans to issue subpoenas for
documents and testimony regarding the clemency case, according to
its chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman, said that the
department officials would appear but would not testify regarding
advice given to the president or deliberative communications. Those
to be subpoenaed are Jon Jennings, acting assistant attorney
general; Neil Gallagher, the FBI's assistant director for
terrorism, and Michael Cooksey, an assistant director at the Bureau
of Prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, dismissed Burton's
action as politically motivated. ``I don't really know what
legislative accomplishments he's had in his tenure as chairman,''
Lockhart said. ``But I can tell you that we've gotten something
like 700 subpoenas from him. He has publicly stated that his
mission is to get the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans concede that the clemency matter is
more or less moot now.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the prisoners were freed last Friday. Two prisoners
rejedted the offer; one accepted a deal to serve five more years,
and two who had already served out jail sentences were forgiven
outstanding fines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republicans have sought to keep the matter alive as a
political miscalculation by Clinton who, some suggest, seemed
unaware of the kind of backlash that such a move would create in
the minefield of New York politics and among law-and-order
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The president said last week that he was responding to
humanitarian calls for the prisoners' release, that they had served
long enough, that none of them had done anyone ``bodily harm'' and
that they were being punished excessively for ``guilt by
association'' with terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But his response seems to have satisfied few and only fueled his
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's likely Senate opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
the Republican mayor of New York City, excoriated the president on
Thursday for trying to ``conceal'' the basis of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking a very, very questionable and bizarre situation
and making it appear even more questionable and bizarre,'' the
mayor said. ``He has never granted clemency before in any serious
case. All of a sudden he does, and now he wants to not release the
documents from which he made the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that Clinton's invocation of executive privilege
should not suggest anything untoward in his decision-making
process, rejecting any suggestions that the president offered the
clemency to help his wife win the support of Puerto Rican voters.
He said the president had every right to receive advice
confidentially.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As he has in the past, Lockhart noted that the president's
decision was based on a recommendation from Charles F.C. Ruff, who
was his counsel until a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say absolutely and unequivocally that this case was
based on the merits as presented by the former counsel, Chuck Ruff,
and the politics of New York or anywhere did not come into play,''
Lockhart asserted. Ruff has not returned phone calls on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's three previous claims of privilege were all in 1996
and pertained to the White House travel office firings, a
memorandum to the president on drug enforcement, and policy
regarding Haiti.

STORM PROVES LESS DEVASTATING IN REALITY THAN MANY HAD FEARED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (UPDATES thruout with storm hitting area harder as night went on)  (See also HURRICANE-RDP, HURRICANE-NY-SCENE)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hurricane Floyd raked a waiting and well-prepared New
York region Thursday night, delivering fierce winds and torrents of
rain that pounded beaches, flooded highways and forced the
evacuation of hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the region, including New York City and Long Island,
escaped the brunt of the storm and sustained untold inconveniences
and sizable disruptions but little major damage. But in certain
areas, particularly northern New Jersey and Rockland County, N.Y.,
the heavy rains turned tree-lined streets into raging rivers,
flooding hundreds of homes and stranding hundreds of homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday night, the storm had stoked winds of up to 62
mph and dumped more than 13 inches of rain in some areas. The
center of the storm passed through central Long Island Thursday
night; the tail of the storm, meteorologists said, was expected to
leave the area by early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But all through the day, a downgraded Tropical Storm Floyd _ and
the fear of Floyd _ generated a host of disruptions that
compromised life in the New York region.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Transit suspended bus service from the Port Authority
Bus Terminal in Manhattan. The area's three major airports
suspended most operations. And Thursday night, transit officials _
fearful of flooded tracks _ shut down Metro-North but ran limited
service sporadically on two lines.
</P>
<P>
   In Bergen County, rescue squads used boats to pluck residents
trapped in flooded homes. In Clarkstown Township, in Rockland
County, more than 1,200 people were trapped in their homes Thursday
night, surrounded by floods, waiting to be evacuated by the
National Guard. And in Vineland, N.J., water was coursing so
rambunctiously through the sewer system that it uncorked manhole
covers.
</P>
<P>
   However dramatic the storm, though, the reality turned out to be
a little less devastating, perhaps, than the so-called storm of the
century that some people had anticipated. As of late Thursday
night, there were no reported deaths related to the storm in the
New York region and no interruptions to subway service.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, New York City appeared to have been less
discombobulated by the obsessively watched, Weather
Channel-friendly trajectory of Floyd than it was three weeks ago
when a surprising three-inch flash flood crippled the region's
transportation network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the storm is about as we expected, maybe even a little
less,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday morning at a news
conference at the city's crisis-management center.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials were nervously monitoring the flood damage late
Thursday night after girding for a storm, which, as a hurricane,
had pounded the Carolinas on Wednesday night and forced the biggest
evacuation in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   According to Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State
University, the storm _ which at one point covered as much area as
the size of Texas _ licked coastal areas Thursday as it churned
quickly up the East Coast, losing strength along the way.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday night, the storm, moving at 30 mph, was passing
through Long Island en route to Connecticut and central
Massachusetts, said Peter Wichrowski, a meteorologist with the
National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m., the heaviest rainfall in the region _ 13.7 inches _
had fallen on Brewster, N.Y., in Putnam County. The top figure for
the city, the National Weather Service said, was 5.01 inches in
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the day Thursday, meteorologists were predicting
that the storm would wallop eastern Long Island, prompting
officials there to evacuate residents and fortify low-lying areas
with sandbags. But by late Thursday night, it was clear that Long
Island was largely spared, while New Jersey and the lower Hudson
Valley were not.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and other regional officials said that they anticipated
that most services would return to normal Friday , though
Metro-North officials said they were not sure whether all service
would be restored by Friday morning. Schools, Giuliani said, are
expected to reopen Friday. City and state officials were expected
to resume normal workdays. And some of the smaller commodity
markets that closed early Thursday _ including the New York
Mercantile Exchange _ were expected to resume normal hours. ``We
should have the city completely and absolutely returned to
normal,'' Giuliani said late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   There were many unilateral acts of precaution. Gov. Christie
Whitman declared a state of emergency for all of New Jersey on
Wednesday; Gov. George Pataki followed suit Thursday for New York
City and Nassau and Suffolk Counties, deploying 1,500 members of
the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   State and local officials ordered so-called nonessential
employees to leave work early, in order to alleviate any possible
rush hour crush. They encouraged private businesses and other
institutions to do the same _ and many, apparently, heeded that
advice, including the United Nations, which offered employees the
option of leaving at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers had to contend with the closure of significant portions
of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and the Henry Hudson Highway for
most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of bus commuters waited for hours at the Port Authority
Bus Terminal in the late afternoon, because of flooding throughout
the region.
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester County, several roads were temporarily closed
yesterday, including the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Hutchinson
River Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency officials in Bergen County, N.J., closed most of the
major highways in mid-afternoon because of the extensive flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, in Hazlet, N.J., Route 35 _ the main artery
leading from the Garden State Parkway to the shores of Raritan Bay
_ was impassable due to flooding, the police said. But the state's
two main thoroughfares _ the Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike _
remained open.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, officials ordered that residents evacuate Fire
Island and the village of West Hampton Dunes.
</P>
<P>
   In Rockland County, N.Y., a dam on Hyenga Lake burst late
Thursday afternoon. Then, as floodwaters began to rise in
Clarkstown, town officials declared a state of emergency Thursday
night and asked the National Guard to help evacuate about 1,200
residents who they said were trapped in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Tobin, the town's emergency manager, said the police and
fire departments had already rescued 350 people from homes that
were enveloped by rising water. ``At this point, all our streets
are impassable,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said that 150 elderly people had been rescued from the
Squadron Gardens senior citizen complex in New City and another a
several dozen more from a nearby condominium complex. ``In some
cases, the water was up to the ceiling,'' he said.

GUNMAN BOASTED OF TIES TO HATE GROUP, AUTHOR SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Larry Ashbrook, the gunman who killed seven
people and himself at a Baptist church Wednesday, identified
himself three years ago as a member of a small, violent group that
advocates killing Jews and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   While police Thursday said they had found no link between the
47-year-old gunman and hate groups, John Craig, co-author of an
academic study of such groups, said Ashbrook in 1996 boasted of
membership in the Phineas Priests.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook was interviewed three years ago by Craig, one of three
authors of the book, ``Soldiers of God, White Supremacists and
their Holy War for America,'' and he identified himself at that
time as a Phineas Priest.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said that organization was outraged at Southern Baptists
for their efforts to convert Jews to Christianity. At the time of
the church shooting, Baptist churches in Fort Worth were openly
praying for Jewish conversions during the High Holy Days of Rosh
Hashana and Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses to the shooting spree at the Wedgwood Baptist Church
said Ashbrook spewed obscenities and ridiculed the Baptist
denomination before opening fire on 150 teen-agers and adults
attending a youth rally. Ashbrook shot 14 people before committing
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   He also detonated a homemade pipe bomb, but it apparently
resulted in no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about the shootings Wednesday night and I heard
that the gunman was wearing black and killed himself, I knew it had
to be a Phineas Priest,'' said Craig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called some people I know in the white supremacist movement,
and they told me it was Larry Ashbrook.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said he attempted to notify Fort Worth police of
Ashbrook's racist connections and the possible motive for the
shootings Wednesday night, but his telephone calls were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that this is the tip of the iceberg,'' he said.
``There are other Phineas Priests out there, and they feed off one
another's actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Phineas Priest members linked to violence include Buford
Furrow, who allegedly shot children in a Los Angeles Jewish
day-care center, fugitive Eric Rudolph, the abortion center bomber
also suspected in the 1996 Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta, and
three men arrested in a string of bank robberies and bombings in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, a former undercover operative and private investigator
who lives in Houston, said he considers members of the group among
the most dangerous because of their willingness to die in the
process of killing Jews, people of color or anyone who aids those
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are extremely violent loners who don't particularly want
to draw attention to themselves except in death,'' Craig said.
``... He (Ashbrook) obviously had no intention of coming back. He
intended to kill himself and become a martyr to his own kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting Fort Worth Police Chief Ralph Mendoza said Thursday that
authorities had found no link between Ashbrook and hate groups.
But, police and the 47-year-old gunman's neighbors described him as
hostile and paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't like you looking at him,'' said Steve Singer, a
neighbor who frequently passed Ashbrook's house in his car. ``I
would always wave to him and sometimes he would wave back and
sometimes he would just glare at me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to harass the kids ... verbally,'' said Karen Ivy, who
lived two doors down the street. ``He'd yell at them and flip them
off. When they got older, he quit doing that 'cause they wouldn't
take it. One day my son, Robert, and some others had the car radio
on, and Larry came down and said, `Turn that crap off.' Robert told
him to get back to his house and stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ashbrook's most open animosity apparently was directed at
Jack and Nita Hord, who lived across the street.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Ivy said, Hord and some other neighbors were sitting on
Hord's front steps, laughing. Ashbrook drove up and, thinking they
were laughing at him, yelled, ``What are you laughing at?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he unzipped his pants and exposed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the neighbors had lived near him for several
years, they knew little about him. He always wore blue jeans, a
white shirt and a gray windbreaker, they said. Usually he carried a
blue canvas tote bag. His beard, they said, was always
``scraggly.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the neighbors knew of any particular religious beliefs
held by Ashbrook, who lived with his father, described as a quiet,
religious man who drove a bus for a nearby Church of Christ.
Ashbrook's father, 85-year-old Jack D. Ashbrook, died July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said Ashbrook's father supported him and ``he couldn't
hold a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said the only contact Fort Worth police had had with
Ashbrook was in 1971, when they arrested him for possession of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Police, who searched the house late Wednesday night and Thursday
morning, said they found freshly cut sections of pipe, end caps,
fuse and gunpowder and pamphlets pertaining to religion. However,
there was nothing to suggest his attitude toward religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing he wrote were old items, as far back as the
1980s,'' said Mendoza. ``It was complaints about people, his job.
He believed people were out to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Ashbrook wrote at least two letters to the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram in which he detailed encounters with the CIA,
assaults by co-workers and being drugged by police.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said the inside of Ashbrook's tidy frame house had been
trashed with a crowbar and shovel. The toilets had been destroyed
by pouring cement into them.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said Ashbrook had been armed with two firearms. A
.380-caliber handgun had been purchased in February 1992 at a Fort
Worth gun shop, now out of business; the second weapon, a 9 mm
Ruger semiautomatic handgun, had been purchased at a flea market in
the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Danny Rojas, said he and other adults were standing
in a room across the hall from the sanctuary when they heard
popping sounds which they thought was hammering from ongoing
construction work.
</P>
<P>
   But then a church employee came up and said he had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said he went into the hallway where there was smoke
lingering from shots fired before Ashbrook went into the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said he looked through a window into the sanctuary where
his 13-year-old daughter was attending the rally and saw Ashbrook
``walking back and forth, shooting and reloading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him sit down and get back up and walk around some
more.''
</P>
<P>
   He said at one point Ashbrook turned in his direction and raised
his gun. Rojas ducked out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't go in. There was no way of stopping him,'' Rojas
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the gunman walked in the other direction, Rojas rushed over
to a friend, Sydney R. Browning, 36, who was slumped against the
wall in a pool of blood in the foyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get to her. I thought I could help her, but when I
saw how he had shot her, I knew it was no use.'' She had been shot
through the head.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said he then ran upstairs to check on his first-grade son.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said this all took only a few minutes, but it seemed a
lot longer than that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said police found at least 10 magazine clips and 30
spent shell casings on the church floor.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses at the church reported that Ashbrook was cursing
Baptists intermittently during his shooting spree and continued the
diatribe as he sat in a back pew and turned one of his weapons on
himself.
</P>
<P>
   According to statements they gave police, he said, ``This
religion is (expletive), and I can't believe you believe this
junk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It all fits too well,'' said Craig.
</P>
<P>
   A question that remained unanswered Thursday was how and why
Ashbrook chose Wedgwood Baptist as his target. The church was the
scene of a gathering of about 150 youths in the school prayer
movement known as ``See You at the Pole,'' a reference to a
schoolyard flagpole.
</P>
<P>
   The church is not on any main thoroughfare, however, and
Ashbrook was not a member.
</P>
<P>
   As to speculation that Ashbrook was angry at the Southern
Baptist Church for reaching out to Jews, one Wedgwood Baptist
member said that would not explain why he targeted her church.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's every Baptist church's mission,'' said Cindy Hoak, 18.
``The whole Southern Baptist Conference is doing the same thing.''

   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ The heart of Hurricane Floyd raked across the
mainland here at Cape Fear Thursday morning, uprooting beach houses
and leaving widespread floods as it set a rapid but steadily
weakening course up the Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   The vast storm, whose advent alarmed much of the Eastern
seaboard and widely disrupted air, rail and highway travel, was
clearly losing its power with the dawn Thursday as the hurricane's
eye danced across the coastline following a two-week buildup of the
forces of nature and the precautions of government.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday evening, as Floyd reached northeastward along the
New Jersey coast to New York City, its strength had further waned.
It was downgraded to a tropical storm that still delivered lashing
rain but that officials said presented no major threat to New York
or other population centers.
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 deaths were attributed to Floyd, eight of them from
traffic accidents in the Carolinas and Virginia. Two girls in
Delaware drowned after a storm-swollen creek swept them into a
sewage pipe; a woman was killed in Virginia when a tree fell on her
mobile home, and one man was presumed drowned in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   The storm swept away parts of a bridge in North East, Md.,
forcing 100 families downstream to abandon their homes. Four oil
tanks holding 80,000 gallons collapsed, though officials were
unsure if the oil contaminated nearby Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   In the howling predawn of this coastal city, Floyd's power was
measured to be dropping from a Category 4 to a Category 2 hurricane
before dropping further to a tropical storm. While storm-drenched
hurricane veterans were delighted after all the ominous evacuation
warnings that it delivered far less physical injury and property
destruction than originally feared, Floyd nevertheless proved
relentlessly drenching, dropping as much as 19 inches of rain in
some areas, and cutting power to 1.4 million in the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were blessed this time,'' Fire Chief Keith Studt said as he
roamed flooded streets and hacked away at fallen trees cluttering
the streets of nearby Winter Park. ``We were lucky this thing
suddenly ratcheted down before it hit town.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the flooding and house damage out on Oak Island and
other coastal barrier islands was considerable as the storm headed
unpredictably northward, causing further disruption across a wide
swath of the seaboard. Residents emerged uncertainly here from
emergency centers to blink at piles of suddenly sun-dappled debris.
By then Floyd was speeding up along the coast by Virginia,
Chesapeake Bay and the New Jersey shore.
</P>
<P>
   It lost further power but still spewed fresh damage along its
western flank as the storm was described as fading into a rough
course aimed toward eastern Long Island. But travel turmoil was
widespread during the day and quickly became bumper to bumper
around Washington, as a truck overturned on the storm-lashed
Chesapeake Bay Bridge and blocked one of the major regional
arteries.
</P>
<P>
   On St. Michael's, a resort and retirement village on an
elbowlike peninsula reaching into Chesapeake Bay, the day's rain
and winds started turning savage in midafternoon as the eye of the
storm approached.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Murphy is a netter, who fishes with nets attached to
poles. He left two, $10,000 polenets standing in the bay, where he
assumed they would be safe from a northeaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's coming from the northwest,'' Murphy said. He said his
nets had withstood 40-mph winds. ``But this was 60 or 70,'' he
said, figuring his rigs were lost. ``The netters are caught real
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm's eye loomed out of the Atlantic's 30-foot seas as a
somewhat tentative invader, avoiding a deep inland attack and
cutting across Cape Fear at 3:20 a.m. to begin a rapid ride up the
coastline. Open relief at the turning was the reaction from this
storm-hardened city, which has had to batten down for five
hurricanes in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was merciful that it didn't come through at the 155 mph
they were first talking about,'' said James Blanton, hitching his
pickup truck's chain to a tree fallen across the road to his
granddaughter's house. ``That's what saved us, even with all this
flooding.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the storm registered sustained winds of 98 mph that
gusted up to 130, tearing up the roof of the Brunswick County
Hospital to the south. There was some roof damage as well to
Wilmington's historic Cotton Exchange building, which is now a
shopping mall centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   One unnerving accident was the draining of 2 million gallons
from a hog waste lagoon into the Northeast Cape Fear River, about
40 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise the storm caused minimal structural damage here,
as in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The old buildings of downtown Charleston shrugged off lashing
wind and rain, as many have there for two centuries. ``These old
houses have seen a lot worse,'' said Park Smith, wielding a saw to
create fresh firewood from a fallen tree near South Battery Street.
</P>
<P>
   Charleston suffered little more than $10 million in damage,
according to the county director of building services, Carl
Simmons. ``Very, very minor,'' he declared. Other residents said
Floyd would be remembered for the convoys of rain-slickered
television anchormen who hit the beaches more than for the actual
glancing blow the storm delivered.

   Down the coast in Myrtle Beach, S.C., wind damage was minimal
but flooding was severe along the coastal Grand Strand. Safety
workers had to deal with snakes fleeing to dry ground and drivers
determined to ford passages left obviously risky with coursing
flood water. National Guardsmen audibly cursed one driver who
ventured blithely ever deeper into a flooded crossing in his pickup
truck. Suddenly, the driver, his wife and daughter had to be
rescued when the truck was swept away.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he made the attempt, the driver, Ralph Elem,
personified the sense of happy adventure that seemed part of the
local post-hurricane mood. ``For the heck of it,'' Elem replied.
``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The main effect here from Floyd was a relentless 34-hour record
rainfall of 19.06 inches that spilled beyond drainage ditches,
flooded houses and blocked major crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen water like this,'' said Donald Squires as he
paddled in a rowboat down the road to his house, which he found
sitting high and mostly dry in outlying Delco. ``This sure ain't
another Hazel, not the way my father always talked,'' he said of
the 1954 hurricane that set this city's benchmark for death and
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   As he roamed in the sunlight that followed the storm, Fire Chief
Studt was openly grateful that Floyd never lived up to the advance
billing. ''But, hey, we got another one coming next week,'' he
quickly added, his eye out for an evolving storm called Gert.

SEASON, POSSIBLY CAREER, OVER FOR COWBOYS' JOHNSTON 
HEADLINE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys fullback Daryl ``Moose'' Johnston has
agreed to follow doctor's orders and sit out the remainder of the
season because of a bulging disk in his neck. The injury, the
second to his neck in two years, jeopardizes the career of one of
the most popular players in the 40-year history of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston will be a re-evaluated after the season to determine
whether he will play again. For now, the 33-year-old veteran of
three Super Bowl teams has been placed on injured reserve/out for
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised. I'm frustrated ... because I had made it
through last year,'' a comeback year from a herniated disk in
October 1997, said Johnston, who stoically held his emotions in
check during a hastily called news conference yesterday at Valley
Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston underwent neck surgery Oct. 31, 1997, at which time the
sixth and seventh vertebrae were fused together. This latest bulge
is just above that fusion, between the fifth and sixth vertebrae,
or about two finger widths above the bone at the base of the neck.
</P>
<P>
   A second operation is not being considered. As Cowboys trainer
Jim Maurer said, ``Range of motion would be affected considerably
with a second fusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys not only lose Johnston's leadership as the
third-oldest player on the team, but they also have a huge void to
fill in their offense. Johnston remained a premier blocker and
occasional pass-catching threat as part of the two-back package in
Chan Gailey's offense.
</P>
<P>
   To fill the void, the Cowboys signed former Pittsburgh Steelers
fullback Tim Lester, recently waived by Jacksonville after signing
with the Jaguars in the off-season. Lester is expected to start at
fullback Monday night against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thomas, a linebacker until three weeks ago, is the
Cowboys' backup fullback. Thomas is an undrafted second-year player
from Henderson State.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston suffered a ``stinger'' when he took a helmet-to-helmet
hit early in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 41-35 overtime victory
at Washington, although Maurer clarified yesterday that Johnston's
latest neck problem is ``chronic in nature ... this didn't happen
on one play.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't keep Johnston from viewing the video tape of that
one play _ toss-sweep right to Emmitt Smith _ over and over
Wednesday as he tried to come to grips with the grim news from the
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was engaged in a block with No. 54 \RRedskins linebacker
Greg Jones\S when the backside end \RMarco Coleman\S hit us both
from the side. I think that's what did it,'' said Johnston, who
left for a couple of plays but returned and had a crucial fumble
recovery in overtime to allow the Cowboys to keep the ball and win
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still it didn't seem that big of a collision. The \Rstinger\S
went away real fast, and the strength came back into my arm. I
didn't think it was anything to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   The stinger might not have caused the bulging disk, but it
revealed it. Johnston, who was exposed on the expansion draft list
in February and took a pay cut to come back this season, was
ordered to get a magnetic resonance imaging test Wednesday that
came back positive. It was Johnston's first MRI since October.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Sunday's fourth-quarter collision now turns out to be a
blessing in disguise, Maurer admitted, ``It could be construed as
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's wife, Diane, is expecting the couple's first child in
January. He said yesterday that his future will involve talking to
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they are concerned,'' Johnston said. ``So, this is
not going to be a decision that I make by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Johnston wants to remain confident that he can come back
next season. He won't allow himself to think anything less.
</P>
<P>
   ``This \Rinjury\S is not as severe as the first one. I'm sitting
down now to prevent what it became for me two years ago,'' Johnston
said. ``But the last time it was a herniation. This is just a bulge
at this stage, which is why I was surprised I won't be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said that he didn't try to talk the doctor out of
sitting out this season and that the doctor didn't order him to
retire. But Johnston said he feels fine and was experiencing no
pain yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he attended the running backs' meetings as usual,
albeit now as a ``coach'' who will assist in preparing Lester, who
already is familiar with Gailey's system at Pittsburgh, and helping
expedite the learning process for Thomas, who replaced Johnston for
a few plays Sunday and threw a bruising block to spring Chris
Warren on a 23-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman said he didn't even know that Johnston
was injured Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't fill the void Moose is leaving,'' Aikman said. ``He
is as good at his position as any player in this locker room is at
their position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' first three picks of the 1989 NFL draft were
Aikman, Johnston and Mark Stepnoski.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's frustrating for D.J. because he was becoming more
and more a part of what we were doing in this system,'' Aikman
said. ``He wanted to get back to the level that he was playing
prior to the \R1997\S injury, and was doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning to the field in 1998, Johnston said he has known
since returning to action last season that he might be grounded
medically, maybe for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the nature of this game,'' he said, ``and definitely the
nature of this position.''

Sunday's play sums up Moose's calling 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the book does close on Daryl Johnston's long Cowboys career,
that final chapter will read like a feel-good Hollywood script.
After 10-plus years, and even after enduring a couple of off-season
insults, the Moose can always be remembered like this:
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of a human pile, with a fumbled football on the
ground, and a frantic overtime game on the line, who came up with
Emmitt Smith's fumble, saving the Cowboys from defeat and Emmitt
from a week of sleepless nights?
</P>
<P>
   If that becomes the last time Johnston ever touched the ball for
the Cowboys, it would not only be poetic, but also a total summary
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   An unsung, basically forgotten hero, who had one arm free at the
bottom of that pile, Johnston reached out and pulled the ball under
him. Four plays later, Rocket Ismail was running under a
game-winning 76-yard pass from Troy Aikman, making it a victory
that will be retold around Texas campfires for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Without Johnston doing the dirty work on that fumble, none of it
would have been possible. But who remembers? Again, I ask _ is that
the story of Johnston's career, or what?
</P>
<P>
   We learned, however, two years ago not to rush Daryl Johnston
into retirement. The serious neck injury in 1997, the surgery that
followed, and then the comeback in '98, serve as recent reminders
that giving a last call for Moose can be premature.
</P>
<P>
   As was announced yesterday, there are now more chronic Johnston
neck problems, not necessarily related to the last one, but, of
course, for the same reason. A decade in the NFL of being a human
battering ram takes a toll on even the strongest of necks.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnston recovered the overtime fumble on Sunday, he was
playing hurt, as if that made a difference. There had been a neck
``stinger'' earlier in the game. Due to numbness, Daryl removed
himself from the game, then returned. Because of the numbness,
however, Johnston was advised to see a doctor this week.
</P>
<P>
   This medical verdict brought bad news. Johnston will miss the
remainder of this season, a blow to the Cowboys' offense. The only
backup fullback is converted linebacker Robert Thomas, prompting
the Cowboys to sign free agent fullback Tim Lester, who formerly
played for Chan Gailey in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, meanwhile, refused to think yesterday in terms of
retirement. ``I didn't two years ago, and that's one of the things
that helped get me back on the field. I'm going to go through
\Rrehab\S step by step and see what the results are.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 33, Johnston and wife Diane are expecting their first child
in January. ``I do have other things to consider,'' he said when
asked about playing again in 2000. But, of course, this is also a
pure football player, and not a big, dumb one either. An academic
All-American at Syracuse, Johnston is smart enough to plot his own
football future while weighing the potential consequences of
playing with a damaged neck.
</P>
<P>
   For safety reasons, many of us urged Johnston to retire in 1997.
But he listened to his doctors, and then made the decision to
return. Now will come yet another decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Johnston said yesterday. ``I think this
team has the potential to do great things. You want to be part of
it, and not watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this, there was uncertainty over Johnston's being around
this season. He was left unprotected for the expansion draft and
bypassed by Cleveland. His salary was then slashed. During training
camp, there was also talk of Johnston being fazed out of Chan
Gailey's offensive system.
</P>
<P>
   But when the season kicked off in Washington, there was Daryl
doing what Daryl has seemingly done forever _ helping clear holes
for Emmitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the greatest games I've ever been involved
in,'' Johnston said of the Washington win. And although few
remembered, he ended up saving that game.
</P>
<P>
   During training camp, Johnston constantly wore the brightest of
smiles in Wichita Falls. Despite the pay cut and the expansion
draft ordeal, he approached the new season with vigor. And his
season lasted one game.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, as Johnston's career was in doubt, former Cowboys
coach Jimmmy Johnson paid him a high compliment. ``Today's players
all want to carry the ball _ you just can't find a battering ram
like D.J.,'' he said. ``He's a dinosaur who doesn't care about the
headlines. I was lucky to have coached him, and I'm still looking
for another one just like him.''
</P>
<P>
   When that loose fumble was on the ground last Sunday, who was
there? And who remembers?

BOXING'S OSCAR AND FELIX GENERATE HEAVYWEIGHT BUZZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Undefeated welterweight champions Oscar De La Hoya
and Felix Trinidad plan to settle who is the best pound-for-pound
boxer during their unification title fight tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Oscar and Felix _ boxing's Odd Couple _ are generating
staggering prefight dollar figures for their beleaguered sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest nonheavyweight fight of the 1990s,'' said
Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada State Athletic
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000-seat Mandalay Bay Events Center is a sellout.
Projections are that the fight will become the first nonheavyweight
bout to have 1 million or more pay-per-view buys. In addition,
betting statewide is on track to approach record levels.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout at the Mandalay Bay means the fight already has
generated $13.5 million. That is almost enough to cover the
guaranteed purse for De La Hoya, the World Boxing Council champion
at 147 pounds. De La Hoya, of East Los Angeles, Calif., is
guaranteed $15 million but could earn up to $21 million if Top
Rank's pay-per-view projections prove true.
</P>
<P>
   Top Rank spokesman Lee Samuels said the company is shooting for
1.5 million PPV buys on TVKO, which is offering the fight at
$49.95.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad, the International Boxing Federation champion from
Copey Alto, Puerto Rico, is guaranteed $10.5 million. He will
pocket a percentage of the PPV gate after 850,000 buys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even in the wildest dreams 15 years ago people would think
two welterweights would make over $25 million. That's a dream,''
said Jose Sulaiman, president of the WBC. ``I think that Oscar De
La Hoya has been a gift to the WBC and to boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   The record for domestic pay-per-view sales is the 860,000 buys
generated by the charismatic De La Hoya and Pernell ``Sweet Pea''
Whitaker for their welterweight title fight in 1997. De La Hoya
laid claim to the mythical pound-for-pound crown with his 12-round
victory over the six-time world champion in that bout. The boxing
PPV record is the 1.9 million buys set by heavyweights Evander
Holyfield and Mike Tyson for their second fight.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup has boxing insiders comparing it to great fights of
the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   The middleweight slugfest between Marvelous Marvin Hagler and
Tommy Hearns here in 1985, and the subsequent Sugar Ray
Leonard-Hagler 160-pound blockbuster in 1987, remain as
nonheavyweight classics. But even the storied welterweight
unification fight between Leonard and ``Hit Man'' Hearns in 1981 is
beginning to look like ancient betting history in this gaming
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fight reminds me of Ray Leonard and Tommy Hearns _
because of the timing of it,'' said veteran trainer Angelo Dundee,
who worked Leonard's corner on the night he stopped Hearns in the
13th round. ``People are hungry for a good fight right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two different individuals. But I think the timing in
both fights is great, in that everybody is interested in the fight.
This is it. It can't be nothing but a good fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Bob Arum, the president of Top Rank, said, ``This fight
is right up there with Hagler-Hearns and Leonard-Hearns, except
that it has the added Hispanic spice. In the Anglo community, it's
not as big as those fights. But in the Hispanic community it's
bigger, and the combination makes it bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The sports books in Las Vegas figure to do a record business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at this fight to do more than Tyson-Holyfield II did
in terms of dollar value in wager,'' said Gene Kivi, the race and
sports book manager at the Mandalay Bay. ``I'd say you're looking
at between $10 million to $15 million, throughout the state. What
makes it great is it's a pick-em fight instead of having such a
prohibitive favorite. And if you can pick the winner, God bless
you, because you've got the two best fighters in their weight class
going toe-to-toe.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya stood as the 6-5] favorite yesterday, but the odds
are expected to fluctuate before first bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great action fight,'' said Kivi, who downplayed the
notion that Trinidad remains relatively unknown to nonboxing fans
in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Each fighter is 26. De La Hoya is 31-0 with 25 knockouts;
Trinidad is 35-0 with 30 KOs. Their common opponents include
warriors Whitaker, Hector ``Macho'' Camacho and Oba Carr.
</P>
<P>
   Now all this Odd Couple needs to do is exceed the hype against
one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing for the industry is a good fight,''
Ratner said. ``For the boxing business, if this is an exciting
fight with no controversy _ and that's all I ever want is a
dramatic, clear-cut winner _ it'll be the best thing for the
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratner pointed to the night in Las Vegas in June, when Fort
Worth's Paulie Ayala won the World Boxing Association bantamweight
championship with a unanimous decision against Johnny Tapia. It was
12 rounds of nonstop, old-fashioned fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great fight _ but a regional, Southwest fight,'' Ratner said.
``This is a worldwide fight. If we could have a Tapia-Ayala in this
fight, you'd convert millions of fans to boxing.''

   IRVING, Texas _ The reality of life in the NFL is to understand
that there will be Daryl Johnston-like disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   The time-tested flip side is that such setbacks often set up Tim
Lester-like opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In one room at the Cowboys' Valley Ranch headquarters, there sat
the 10-year veteran Johnston, explaining the frustrations of
another season-ending neck injury that possibly could end his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to Cowboys coaches in another room sat the newly signed
Lester, who was at home in Miami preparing to coach Pop Warner
football when the Cowboys called Wednesday night and asked him if
he wanted a job.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-year veteran Lester, 31, who was cut by the
Jacksonville Jaguars in training camp, didn't have to be asked
twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the call about 9 or 10 p.m.,'' Lester said giddily. ``I
was on the plane and out at about 6:15 a.m. I threw some clothes in
a bag and I'm here. I told my mom, but I don't think she understood
because she was kind of sleepy. I'll call her when I get back to
the \Rhotel\S room.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering his long day, Lester was probably sleepy himself.
This dream, however, is real.
</P>
<P>
   Lester is in Irving because the Cowboys were familiar with him
from his days as Jerome Bettis' lead blocker in Pittsburgh, where
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey formerly served as offensive coordinator.
Lester did not record any rushing attempts for the Steelers last
season, but he did catch nine passes for 46 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the Cowboys couldn't have found a better replacement
for Johnston because of Lester's proven track record as a blocking
fullback and knowledge of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough and smart football player,'' Gailey said. ``We
are fortunate he was available and we could get him here. This was
a very short notice situation to try to get somebody ready to play.
And to have a guy that knows the system and most of the terminology
is very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Lester will have the same role as Johnston, serving
as a blocker and playing on special teams. Lester, who signed a
prorated deal for the league minimum of $400,000, will likely play
in front of backup fullback Robert Thomas when the Cowboys take the
field against the Atlanta Falcons on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys officials like Thomas but don't believe he's ready to be
the starting fullback because of his inexperience at the position.
It has been less than four weeks since Thomas was moved to fullback
from linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys officials are confident Lester is ready to go. They said
he had an excellent camp with the Jaguars and was cut because
Jacksonville wanted to go with a younger player with a less
expensive contract. Stacey Mack, an undrafted free agent, is the
backup fullback for the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   While Lester understood Jacksonville's decision, he said he was
still disappointed because he felt he played well. But he never
thought his career was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach told us going into camp they were going to keep just one
guy,'' Lester said. ``I knew it was going to be the younger guy.
But I knew I could still play. It was just one of those things. You
have to wait for someone to get nicked or injured. You just have to
wait it out.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all part of what started out as a disappointing 1999 for
Lester. The player, once known as the ``Bus Driver'' because he led
the way for Bettis, ``The Bus,'' only went to Jacksonville because
of off-season changes in Pittsburgh. With Kevin Gilbride taking
over as offensive coordinator, Lester said the Steelers wanted to
go in a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   A new direction came yesterday for Lester, who feels like he has
gone home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed but I ended up in a better place,'' Lester
said. ``Chan is here. \RFormer Steelers teammate\S Ernie Mills is
here. I feel like I'm home.''

IN FORT WORTH, THE GAMES SHOULD NOT JUST GO ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Texas Rangers have announced that they
will hold a moment of silence before tonight's game to honor the
shooting victims of Wedgwood Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, that doesn't seem like much.
</P>
<P>
   The game will go on. The game usually always goes on, doesn't
it?
</P>
<P>
   A young president was once assassinated, and only 48 hours later
the NFL played its entire Sunday slate of games. Last night, barely
24 hours after the tragedy that killed four teen-agers, Keller
played a high school football game against Cleburne.
</P>
<P>
   Keller coach Ken Mizell said there had been ``no discussion''
about postponing the game.
</P>
<P>
   There should have been.
</P>
<P>
   How someone chooses to grieve, of course, is a very personal
thing. The best expressions of sympathy are often only in the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened in Wedgwood could have happened in any part of
our town, even in the tranquil and growing suburb of Keller. I
found myself reading something that Pierre Lacroix, the general
manager of the Colorado Avalanche, said after the shootings in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are our kids,'' Lacroix said. ``We belong to this
community, and these kids are ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche, you may recall, postponed not one, but two of
their first-round Stanley Cup playoff games. In effect, they
surrendered their home-ice advantage and began the series at San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   After the tragedy at Columbine High School, the baseball
Colorado Rockies also postponed two games and the NBA Denver
Nuggets rescheduled one. All three Denver teams chose to wear some
sort of uniform patch or stripe to honor the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Those kids were their kids.
</P>
<P>
   As the dove flies, Wedgwood isn't a lot further from Arlington
and Keller than Littleton is from Denver. So what's the criteria
for a tragedy hitting close to home?
</P>
<P>
   Ten miles? Twenty minutes? Thirteen deaths? Or seven?
</P>
<P>
   If Wednesday night's shootings would have taken place at a
school, rather than a community church, would it have mattered?
</P>
<P>
   No, these were our kids. They were gathered in what probably was
the safest place they knew, singing hymns and listening to music.
</P>
<P>
   If you have teen-agers, or work with teen-agers, and can't
identify with that, there's something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   How much is too much for a team to do? I don't know the answer
to that, except to say that in times of tragedy like this, it would
be impossible for a school or a team to do too much.
</P>
<P>
   Again, I go back to the words of the NHL Avalanche, who handled
that tragedy with an amazing grace.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Forsberg said his team made the right decision ``out of
respect to the families.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Jeff Odgers told ``The Denver Post:'' ``This is our
community. We're part of them. We want to show them we care about
them and respect them.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would argue that the Rangers organization hasn't been a
solid member of this community. Their outreach program stretches
deep into Fort Worth's schools. The Rangers, in the best sense of
the term, are family entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But the right thing to do would have been to postpone tonight's
game. Play a doubleheader tomorrow or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Out of respect to the families.
</P>
<P>
   And then move on. Let the healing begin.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't used to be a fervent advocate of commemorative patches
or armbands. But after seeing the effect that the Columbine patches
had, I realize how those things can carry a powerful message. The
Columbine patch _ even the Stars wore them during their conference
final series _ made the viewer stop and remember. That's not so
maudlin, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Sports never knows what to do at times like this. We are, after
all, life's fun and games. There's no crying in baseball, we're
told.
</P>
<P>
   So we have our moment of silence and we play ball. The games, we
say, help us forget.
</P>
<P>
   What if it's too soon to forget?

LET'S PUT SOME PERSPECTIVE ON ECONOMIC STATISTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: One of the more pointless economic exercises is harping
on the income gap between America's most well-heeled and those
closer to average circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   It's pointless, that is, if those doing the comparing can't put
the situation into some meaningful perspective.
</P>
<P>
   One useful perspective would be to include some statistics
concerning the mobility factor. First of all, it's unusual for
Americans to remain in the same income category for long periods of
time. Studies have shown over many years that most Americans tend
to be very mobile when it comes to what income brackets they occupy
over their lifetimes. Some make it big, some modestly, and many
have significant ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   The best living example of America's income dynamism is Bill
Gates. In only a couple of decades Gates has gone from impecunious
college dropout struggling to build a business to richest person on
the planet, and maybe in the entire history of the world. In the
process, his success at making Microsoft a magnificent
wealth-creation machine no doubt has helped widen the gap between
the plutocracy and everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The latest analysis of Congressional Budget Office
income-distribution data comes courtesy of the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, which is characterized as an advocate of federal
fiscal policies it believes would benefit the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's most eye-popping statistic is one showing
that the top 2.7 million will have as much after-tax income this
year as the 100 million at the opposite end of the spectrum. This
may disturb some and outrage others, but is such income disparity
meaningful or relevant to average folk?
</P>
<P>
   Not if most everyone else is living reasonably well. Most
pertinent statistics indicate that they are. Despite claims that
American workers are losing ground, long-term patterns of personal
consumption, home ownership, household furnishings and
entertainment and leisure spending belie such claims.
</P>
<P>
   The test of any society's economy is how effectively it
contributes to the material welfare of all those involved. The U.S.
economy functions better in this regard than any other economy in
humankind's history.
</P>
<P>
   Why? It could be argued that America's economy delivers for its
participants better than any other ever has because it does allow
the achievement of what some perceive as obscene amounts of filthy
lucre.
</P>
<P>
   As for those mired inextricably in poverty, it's not as if
they've been ignored. Over the past generation, the federal
government alone has spent more than $5 trillion of its citizens'
money trying to ameliorate poverty. Combined with the economic
resources contributed voluntarily by private charitable activities,
the total effort probably adds up to the most massive exercise in
human benevolence in history.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it has helped, sometimes not, but nobody could ever
convincingly claim America is a miserly and mean-spirited society.
</P>
<P>
   As for those who make an ostentatious show of their concern for
how fiscal policies affect the truly poor, do they have an agenda
beyond encouraging class warfare? If so, they'd do well to remember
that income statistics are more a way of keeping score than
measuring the quality of anyone's life.

MISSOURI BANKER AND FDIC AT LOGGERHEADS ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES R.T. CRUMPLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is
crossing swords once again with Glen Garrett, the southwest
Missouri banker who spent eight years and $2 million successfully
fending off a $25,000 fine from the FDIC.
</P>
<P>
   The banker and the bank regulator ended that bitter spat last
March. Now, the FDIC and Garrett are sparring anew because the FDIC
won't allow two of its former bank examiners to help Garrett by
testifying in a lawsuit that Garrett has filed against a competing
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The FDIC says the reason is simple: Its examiners are prohibited
by federal law from testifying in such matters.
</P>
<P>
   But Garrett's legal consultant, a former FDIC lawyer, believes
the reason is that the FDIC doesn't want to do anything that could
help Garrett. The FDIC could allow its examiners to testify but
doesn't want to, said the consultant, Stephens Woodrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is the FDIC doing this? Beats me,'' Woodrough said. ``The
only thing I can figure out is that the FDIC is continuing its
vendetta, if you will, by taking totally unreasonable...actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett and the FDIC have a long and acidic history.
</P>
<P>
   FDIC examiners started scouring the little bank that Garrett
owns, the First State Bank of Purdy, Mo., in 1991. The FDIC, which
is the federal agency that regulates banks, thought Garrett was a
reckless banker and at various times tried to punish or fine him,
and it once tried to expel him from banking.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers caught in such a position routinely accept some
sanction. But Garrett, saying he might have been sloppy but had
done nothing wrong or dishonest, fought back. He thinks that's when
the FDIC turned vengeful. It tied him up through most of the 1990s,
charging him with one offense after another. The attacks cost
Garrett $2 million in legal fees and millions more in lost
business, Garrett has said.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett also accused the FDIC of sitting on information and of
other misconduct. Six months ago, the two sides signed an unusual
agreement. The FDIC agreed to back off, and Garrett agreed not to
sue the FDIC.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from his fight with the FDIC, Garrett in early 1997 filed
a lawsuit against UMB Bank Southwest, the successor to the United
Missouri Bank of Monett, Mo. That bank competes with Garrett's
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett's lawsuit alleges defamation, claiming that the
president of the then United Missouri Bank of Monett, Jerry
Sebastian, informed regulators that there were ``a lot of bad
things going on'' at Garrett's bank, such as insider abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other alleged comments prompted regulators to begin
scrutinizing Garrett's bank, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit
seeks unspecified damages from UMB Bank Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for parent company UMB Financial Corp. in Kansas
City said the company does not comment on pending litigation.
However, UMB denies the allegations in court documents. Sebastian
made true statements to regulators, or statements he believed to be
true or justified, according to those documents. Furthermore,
Garrett's slander claim was made after the statute of limitations
had expired, UMB said.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster his case against UMB, Garrett recently subpoenaed two
former FDIC examiners who investigated Garrett's bank. The
examiners are not on trial, but Garrett hopes they could testify on
whether the UMB bankers' comments prompted the examiners to pursue
Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   But in late August, the FDIC lawyers stepped in and halted the
now former examiners from giving depositions in Garrett's case,
saying that federal law prohibits examiners from testifying in such
cases.
</P>
<P>
   An FDIC spokesman in Washington said he did not want to respond
to Woodrough's comments. The agency does not comment on pending
litigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether the examiners can testify in Garrett's
lawsuit against UMB may be resolved in a few weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrough said Garrett was further rankled because the FDIC _
even though it isn't directly involved in Garrett's lawsuit _ had
gotten Garrett's lawsuit moved to federal court in Kansas City.
That's far from state court in Springfield, which is convenient to
Garrett's bank and where Garrett filed the case. Briefs are
supposed to be filed in the case this week.
</P>
<P>
   From the FDIC's standpoint, the change to federal court is
designed to clear up the issue of whether the regulators can
testify, because that is a federal issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Woodrough said it would cost Garrett more money to get the
lawsuit moved back to the state court.

 By ROBYN MEREDITH   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Paving the way for contracts covering the
nation's 400,000 unionized auto workers, the United Automobile
Workers union and DaimlerChrysler AG on Thursday morning reached
tentative agreement on a four-year pact calling for a $1,350
signing bonus and pay increases of 3 percent a year on top of
adjustments for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   If workers ratify the deal later this month, as expected, they
will also get heftier pension benefits and additional job security,
even as the company is allowed to continue downsizing through
attrition, according to local union officials. Under the current
contract, auto workers have earned between $50,000 and $100,000 a
year, depending on the amount of overtime they work and the level
of corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year agreement is unusual because no auto labor
contracts have lasted longer than three years since the 1950s. This
contract would provide raises of 3 percent for the first three
years, plus a lump-sum payment in the fourth year of 3 percent of
annual wages, according to union and company officials.
</P>
<P>
   The raises come in addition to the inflation adjustments that
have been a mainstay of the union's contracts with automakers since
1948. In the current contract, that adjustment amounted to 90
percent of increases in the Consumer Price Index. So far this year,
inflation is running at a 2.6 percent annual rate, which would
trigger a 2.3 percent increase for auto workers. Workers would also
get a share of corporate profits, as they have in past years.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement includes language prohibiting spinoffs of auto
companies' parts units, local union officials said, and that could
cause headaches for Ford Motor Co., which plans to sell its Visteon
auto parts unit, a move that would affect 23,500 union members.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   UAW national officials and company executives refused to
disclose the details of the deal Thursday, saying they wanted to
first inform workers nationwide. Bargainers reached the deal after
48 hours of round-the-clock talks. ``We have a lead company
agreement,'' UAW spokesman Frank Joyce announced about 8 a.m.
DaimlerChrysler spokesman David Barnas declined to discuss the
terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Because the union typically reaches a deal with one of the Big
Three automakers, then insists the others accept similar terms, the
DaimlerChrysler pact is expected to lay out a pattern for General
Motors Corp. and Ford Motor to follow in their contracts, which are
being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies early on realized that with car sales at record
levels and profits at record levels, they couldn't plead poverty,''
said David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities. ``It is a
generous contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Some local labor officials agreed. ``We're pretty certain that
it will be a pretty good deal for us,'' said Roger Brown, president
of Local 550 in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great package,'' said H. Scott Stanton, vice president
of a Local 624 in Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The language in the DaimlerChrysler contract covering spinoffs
is a big concern for Ford, which is in the process of selling off
Visteon, just as GM spun off its Delphi auto parts division to
investors earlier this year. Relations between Ford and the union,
which for a decade have been the best in the industry, soured this
year because of the company's plans to sell Visteon. That is one
reason why Ford is expected to be the last company to reach a deal
on a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Ford executives said they did not know whether the agreement
reached with DaimlerChrysler would make it more difficult for the
company to divest the auto parts business. ``We need to see the
contract language before we can draw any conclusions,'' said Ed
Miller, a Ford spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's deal may result in similar pay raises for the
nation's nonunion auto workers. Toyota Motor, Honda Motor, Nissan
Motor and Mitsubishi Motors have in the past matched the Big
Three's hourly pay rates.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the auto industry's sheer size, the deal also has
significance for many American workers, said labor experts, who
noted the strength of the wage gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a strong message that if the economy is so good,
workers should be sharing it a bit more,'' said Harley Shaiken, a
labor professor at the University of California at Berkeley. ``The
high wages and the job security provisions promise a more motivated
work force and a better relation with the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaiken, industry analysts and economists cautioned that their
comments were based on an incomplete knowledge of the contract's
contents.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists said that the pay raises and heftier pension
benefits might signal a trade with the union. The UAW has been
pressing the companies to replace retiring workers, but this
contract allows faster downsizing by allowing the company to
replace just one worker for every two who retire, according to
local union officials. The current contracts require the companies
to preserve 95 percent of existing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the UAW workers at the Big Three auto companies are
eligible to retire within the next five years, the union says.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the nation's auto workers, it is a windfall,'' said Diane
Swonk, chief economist at Bank One Corp. in Chicago. ``This is like
the big buyouts that we've seen in the Fortune 500 for the past 20
years for white-collar workers.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The contract will allow the companies to build more cars with
fewer workers, she said. ``The UAW got lucky that the automakers
are doing well enough to offer an olive branch of wage increases,
but I'd be surprised if they stop the downsizing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is counting on continued downsizing. ``The Street is
right now presuming that GM will continue to ride the attrition
wave,'' said Stephen Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. The matter is most important for GM because it has been
cutting its labor force while DaimlerChrysler's American factories
have been hiring, and Ford's employment levels have been slowly
falling since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Girsky called the deal ``one of the richest contracts ever.'' He
calculated that at 3 percent, three years of wage increases would
cost G.M. another $2.26 billion in those years, or between $1.10
and $1.15 a share, assuming volume and productivity stayed the
same. The lump-sum payment would cost GM approximately $375
million. Costs would be lower for Ford and DaimlerChrysler, perhaps
30 to 35 cents a share, Girsky estimated, because they have fewer
workers. These numbers do not include adjustments for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 contract, which was extended Tuesday, featured a $2,000
lump-sum payment in the first year and 3 percent raises in the next
two years in addition to cost-of-living adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   One sticking point in negotiations with DaimlerChrysler was a
dispute over union organizing drives at a Mercedes sport utility
factory in Vance, Ala., and at four factories building Freightliner
trucks and components in North Carolina, South Carolina and
Ontario, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The five nonunion factories were owned by Daimler before it
bought Chrysler. The union received some reassurances that the
company would stay neutral in the bargaining process, but details
were unavailable Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Around 8 a.m., a weary-looking UAW president Stephen Yokich
gathered with his negotiators in DaimlerChrysler's parking lot in
Auburn Hills and called them ``a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether they had popped champagne corks to celebrate
reaching an agreement, Yokich shook his head. ``Champagne? No. Some
of us drank beer, some drank tea and some drank Diet Coke,'' Yokich
said, as an empty Miller beer can clattered to the concrete of the
parking lot, having been dropped by one of his colleagues. One by
one, members of his bargaining team gave him bear hugs and clapped
him on the back, then got in their cars and drove away.
</P>
<P>
   Yokich refused to characterize the talks, which seemed at
several points over the last 20 hours to be nearly concluded. But
he pooh-poohed the idea that the agreement had been close to final
several times, but had been derailed by last-minute sticking
points. ``Close only counts in horseshoes, hand grenades and bocci
balls,'' Yokich said.

MISSOURI SENATE JOINS HOUSE IN VOTING TO OVERRIDE VETO OF ABORTION
BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Missouri abortion opponents scored their
biggest victory in years Thursday when the Senate voted to override
Gov. Mel Carnahan's veto of an anti-abortion bill.
</P>
<P>
   The tally was 27-7, four more votes than the 23 needed for the
bill to take effect over Carnahan's veto. The House overwhelmingly
overrode the veto on Wednesday. Two-thirds majorities were required
in both chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The action represents a stinging rebuke to Carnahan by a General
Assembly controlled by his fellow Democrats. It was the third
override this century, the first since 1980 and the seventh
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan called the legislature's decision ``an unfortunate day
for the women of Missouri'' and indirectly chastised Democratic
lawmakers who deserted him. He said that ``too many legislators
decided it was not in their political interests'' to oppose the
bill, even though most thought it was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some, voting to override was the way to avoid angry phone
calls and hateful mail, and to ensure they would not become targets
of the well-organized anti-choice forces in the next election,''
the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the bill said they would sue, possibly today, to
strike down the new law. Planned Parenthood officials in St. Louis
said Thursday they planned to temporarily suspend operations of the
only Planned Parenthood clinic that performs abortions in Missouri,
because of concerns about the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which has prompted bitter arguments since 1996, would
ban certain late-term abortions _ usually referred to as ``partial
birth'' abortions _ by classifying them as infanticide. Supporters
of the measure have repeatedly labeled the procedure as barbaric
and one that has no place in a civilized society.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this does is make it illegal to kill a baby while it is
being born,'' said Sen. Ted House, a St. Charles Democrat and
sponsor of the bill. ``There's nothing inflammatory about that.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This is not a pro-life//pro-choice debate. This is
not a partisan debate. What we tried to do is draft an infanticide
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. David Klarich, a St. Louis County Republican, said
opponents of the measure missed the point when they predicted that
parts of the bill would provide a legal defense for anti-abortion
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most violent action of this discussion is the procedure we
are trying to ban,'' Klarich said.
</P>
<P>
   But over more than six hours of debate Thursday, opponents
repeatedly charged that the bill would ban abortions as early as 5
1/2 weeks of gestation, provide a legal defense for violence
against abortion doctors and others, and never survive a court
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to give abortion terrorists the cover of law,''
said Sen. Bill Clay Jr. of St. Louis, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ken Jacob, a Columbia Democrat and leading opponent of the
measure, also blasted the lack of a provision in the bill to permit
the procedure to preserve a mother's health, not just her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to put a woman in a position of choosing between
her health and committing murder? That's what this bill will do,''
Jacob said.
</P>
<P>
   Lou DeFeo, lobbyist for the Missouri Catholic Conference and one
of the drafters of the bill, said after the vote he was pleased by
the override and was confident the bill would withstand a court
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very good about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeFeo also said public support for the bill helped persuade
lawmakers to override the veto. Abortion opponents flooded
lawmakers with telephone calls and letters in recent days, and
thousands of backers of the bill rallied at the state Capitol on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill became law shortly after 6:30 p.m. Thursday, when the
override tally was delivered to the Missouri secretary of state's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Gianino, president and chief executive officer of Planned
Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, said her group would seek an
injunction against the bill in federal court in Kansas City. She
said the bill was vague and failed to include essential exceptions
for women who were victims of rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until and unless we get an injunction, we will suspend
providing abortion services,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Brownlie, president and chief executive officer for
Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, said his office
would back the legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that Planned Parenthood is forced to take this
action, but our mission and our patients require that we defend the
reproductive rights of all women and families in Missouri,''
Brownlie said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. House said he welcomed having the issue settled by the
courts. He said that although he thought the bill was
constitutional, he would not make any predictions about the outcome
of the court fight.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Thursday was just the latest chapter in a long-running
argument over ``partial birth'' abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers approved a similar bill in 1997. Carnahan vetoed it,
and the Senate failed by one vote to override it.
</P>
<P>
   This year's bill won lopsided approval in both chambers in May.
Senate approval followed 38 hours of often pointed debate.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, who said he would favor a constitutional ban on the
late-term procedure, launched an intense effort in recent weeks to
have his veto sustained. He charged that backers of the bill were
deceptive and hoped to make most abortions illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters charged Carnahan with using inflammatory rhetoric and
resorting to a ``smoke screen'' to try to defeat the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the arguments, the Senate override tally was nearly
identical to the 27-6 vote earlier this year. The House override
was virtually the same as the original vote, too.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he did not have any second thoughts about
having his name added to the short list of Missouri chief
executives whose vetoes were overridden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no regrets about waging this battle,'' he said. ``It
needed to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The abortion debate took an odd twist when Sen. Jet Banks, a St.
Louis Democrat, pleaded guilty Thursday in Cole County Circuit
Court to filing false state income tax returns, a felony. Banks
faces up to five years in prison and a possible $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Banks voted to sustain the override. Senate leaders said his
future in the chamber would not be decided until he was sentenced.

WELLS WORKING TO SHED HIS CARPETBAGGER IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has been nothing subtle about Cal Wells III's entry into
NASCARland. He's not about to apologize _ not even for that snooty
``III'' at the end of his surname.
</P>
<P>
   With no track record in either the Busch Grand National or
Winston Cup series, Wells managed to land the lucrative McDonald's
sponsorship previously aligned with Bill Elliott. Wells also is the
front-runner to officially secure the Tide sponsorship that Ricky
Rudd will lose at the end of this season. Wells has one-upped
popular Cup crew chief Larry McReynolds for Tide's backing,
indefinitely postponing the latter's dream of starting up a Cup
team.
</P>
<P>
   None of the above necessarily makes Wells the carpetbaggin',
wine-tastin' Californian as he has been typecast. Or a rotten guy.
Wells' business associates insist that racing is not a toy to him,
it is a passion.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Rudd signed a three-year deal to drive for Robert
Yates Racing. Elliott has the remainder of this year and next
remaining on his McDonald's deal. But short of spinning out Terry
Labonte on the last lap at Bristol Motor Speedway, Wells has
managed to tick off some pretty prominent players in the Winston
Cup garage area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love garage areas, and I know I'll have to earn my way in
there like anyone else,'' said Wells, 43. ``Some of the unfortunate
disruption might enhance that challenge. I think I'm going to be
greeted with a lot of skepticism until I maybe not just prove it
once, but week in and week out. So the jury is going to be out for
quite a while as far as the perception of our team in the garage
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that being said, I look forward to that challenge and
can't wait for it. Wish we were racing tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells and his Precision Performance, Inc., organization come to
NASCARland directly from the Championship Auto Racing Team FedEx
Series and Toyota-Atlantic Championship. The Champ Car team Wells
co-owns with fellow Californian Frank Arciero has won neither a
pole nor a race dating to 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Wells has compiled an impressive list of accomplishments in
off-road desert racing. But in NASCARland, that rates only slightly
above swamp buggy drag racing. Yet here he comes, ready to field
newly crowned Toyota-Atlantic champion Anthony Lazzaro of Georgia
in a start-up Busch program with McDonald's money in 2000. Wells'
Cup team _ perhaps with Wally Dallenbach Jr., Al Unser Jr. or Bobby
Hamilton at the wheel _ is scheduled to compete next season.
</P>
<P>
   Wells said his decision to go NASCAR racing should not be
interpreted as a vote of no-confidence for CART, which continues to
struggle for fans in the wake of its split with the Pep Boys Indy
Racing League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think CART is spectacular,'' said Wells, whose PPI facility
is located in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif. ``I have a tremendous
group of people over there. I'm not wavering on my CART commitment
at all. But I've always wanted to race in Winston Cup as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells hooked up with Toyota in 1982, and that relationship was
key to the 75 victories and 23 manufacturer/driver championships
compiled by PPI. Among those accomplishments, Wells won the 1995
SCORE Trophy Truck driver's championship with Ivan ``Ironman''
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   When Toyota launched its CART involvement in 1996, Arciero-Wells
was one of two teams designated to bring the program to
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have just as easily gone into NASCAR had that been
something Toyota could have done,'' Wells said. ``Toyota really
took me to CART and I'm thrilled that I was asked to participate
because it gave me additional credibility, which allowed me to come
here \RNASCAR\S. The fact that they \RToyota\S aren't going to be
here within the next 150 years doesn't restrain me from becoming a
part of something I've always wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells has opened a temporary NASCAR shop in Hickory, N.C., with
an option to purchase 50 additional acres. He plans to move dirt in
November for construction of a so-called NASCAR ``campus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come February, I'm going to get one opportunity,'' said Wells,
referring to qualifying for the season-opening Daytona 500. ``I'm
going to get two laps to prove whether I'm full of it or not, and
I'd better be ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds: SPOTLIGHT ON...
AMA's Parker prepares to race into retirement Scott Parker has worn
the No. 1 plate on the front forks of his dirt-track motorcycles
for nearly half of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Parker sported a slightly modified version of the plate, which
goes to the American Motorcyclist Association Grand National Dirt
Track Series champion, for the inaugural Dallas Mile on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The message ``Thanks fans!'' was scripted atop the number, as
the sport's winningest rider barrels into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be `retired' from going for the Grand National
championship, week-in and week-out,'' Parker said in the pits at
Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie. ``I'm going to just take it easy
next year, and probably run three races. That'll be the max I can
see. That way I can go see my friends and get a little excitement
for a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, 37, has been competing as an AMA-licensed expert since
1979. He won two national events as a rookie that year, when at age
17, he became the youngest rider to capture an AMA Grand National
event.
</P>
<P>
   Parker strung together four flat-track championships between
1988-91, tying Carroll Resweber's record for consecutive titles.
Parker's first attempt at a record fifth consecutive championship
fell two points short of factory 750cc Harley-Davidson teammate
Chris Carr in 1992. But Parker reclaimed the No. 1 plate in 1994
and has held it since, securing that elusive fifth consecutive
title last year with seven victories, 12 top-five and 15 top-10
finishes in 18 events.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's 92 all-time victories are exactly 50 more than
runner-up Jay Springsteen, with three races remaining on the 1999
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who has not won a race since May, said he feels fine
physically. But he admitted the lifestyle has become a grind for
his young family. Parker and wife Wanda are the parents of a 3
1/2-year-old daughter, Ashley, and a 2 1/2-year-old son, Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids have been to every race this year, except one,'' said
Parker, of Swartz Creek, Mich. ``My wife's been to every race, and
it gets hectic. We like to do it as a family, instead of me taking
off and saying, `I'll see you next week.' Probably after I've been
retired a couple of months I'll be going, `Damn, I want to go back
to it.' But I don't see that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker said his years of riding factory-backed Harley machines
has made him financially secure. And his records figure to endure
well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's cool,'' said Parker, referring to his numbers.
``I've won nine national championships, and if I can't be happy
walking away from this sport with that, I don't think I can be
happy. And five years from now, it'll probably mean a lot more.''

TRIPLE CROWN FINDS A JEWEL IN TV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Horse racing might have finally come of age: the television age.
</P>
<P>
   This has nothing to do with the development of
interactive/in-home wagering _ or the news that horse racing's
upstart Television Games Network is making its debut in that major
media market of Louisville, Ky. That's small potatoes in your TV
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The meat _ and the gravy _ is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The value of any sport in the mainstream entertainment market
arguably can be measured by one thing: the amount of money that the
major television networks are willing to fork over in order to
televise sporting events tells the story.
</P>
<P>
   When the NFL is able to get a network like Fox, then CBS, to
cough up about a half billion to televise pro football games _ a
clear money-losing proposition for the networks _ you know the NFL
is the kingpin sport.
</P>
<P>
   Such TV contracts have allowed the NFL to increase its salary
cap for players. Horse racing, meanwhile, has been slow to put on
its thinking cap.
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing has never shown up on the same wacky radar screen
with the NFL. In almost all cases for horse racing, it's the sport
that pays for the television coverage instead of the other way
around. In other words, horse racing has paid for production costs
when the TV trucks roll up.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the only time horse racing can command a dollar from
the networks is the Triple Crown and to a far lesser degree the
Breeders' Cup. But even in the case of the Triple Crown, horse
racing has drawn merely a trickle from the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has televised the Triple Crown races of the Kentucky Derby,
Preakness and Belmont since the mid 1970s when it took over from
CBS. In the past few years, ABC has paid less than $10 million for
the television rights. Compare that to the NFL's approximate $500
million from Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But there's word that horse racing might finally be cashing in,
and why not? The Triple Crown has given television three excellent
story lines each of the past three years. Silver Charm and Real
Quiet had stirring runs at the Triple Crown. And nothing could have
been more gripping than the drama surrounding Charismatic this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the Tiffany events in sports,'' said Ed
Seigenfeld, executive vice president of the Triple Crown
Productions group that negotiates TV contracts for Churchill Downs,
Pimlico and Belmont racetracks. ``It's not the Super Bowl. But it's
damn near it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I wouldn't go that far. But horse racing is going farther.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's contract with the Triple Crown will be up after next year.
ABC had the first right of refusal in negotiations, but that
expired last month without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're negotiating with all the networks,'' Seigenfeld said.
``We are just thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Seigenfeld won't confirm it, there are reports that the
networks are being asked for a five-year contract worth more than
$50 million. It's still a zero short of what the NFL gets. But
maybe it's a sign that horse racing no longer has to be a beggar,
and now can be a chooser. LATE SCRATCHES Cycle aftermath The Dallas
Mile motorcycle race finished Saturday night with a noticeable rut
in the surface of the track and an unmistakable 40-foot rip through
the outer rail on the backstretch at Lone Star Park at Grand
Prairie. The rail, where one of the motorcyclists crashed through,
has been replaced. The cushion of the track is still being bladed
back into place with a tractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting it all back together won't be a big problem,'' Lone
Star general manager Corey Johnsen said. ``Ron \RMoore, the track
superintendant\S is really meticulous.''
</P>
<P>
   The horses get their first chance at reacting to the surface
Monday when training hours open for the upcoming quarter-horse
season. Johnsen said it's possible the track will play host to
another motorcycle event next year. Unraveling Manor The Texas
Racing Commission is looking for other tracks to take more
quarter-horse race dates for next year after the commissioners
refused to award dates to Manor Downs near Austin. Manor was
supposed to expand its racing oval from a half-mile to at least
five-eighths of a mile, but efforts by racetrack chief operating
officer Howard Phillips to obtain partial financing through
horsemen failed.
</P>
<P>
   Operators at Retama Park and Sam Houston Race Park appear the
most interested in the extra quarter-horse dates for next year.
Both tracks would negotiate to have unused purse money at Manor
transferred in order to fund most of the races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the purse money, we can't do it,'' Retama chief
executive officer Bryan Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lone Star isn't looking for more dates for next year, the
track is expected to request a doubleheader race day this year on
Oct. 30. The move would extend the racing program into the night
and create a tie-in with the simulcast of the MBNA Challenge
Championships from Los Alamitos Racecourse. Menifee in Louisiana
Officials at Louisiana Downs expect Menifee to run in the $500,000
Super Derby on Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke with one of the owners this morning, and right now it
looks pretty good,'' Louisiana Downs stakes coordinator Coleman
Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd also said the top three finishers from the Remington Park
Derby _ Temperance Time, Answer Lively and Stellar Brush _ are
probables.
SPOTLIGHT ON...
Secret in the desert now a question in the 'cane
There is no way that Almutawakel can sneak up on anyone this time.
The horse who ran in one of those mysterious Persian Gulf trial
races and then won the $5 million Dubai World Cup in March at odds
of more than 30-to-1 has been galloping around the racetrack for
everyone to see this week at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well in the $500,000 Woodward Stakes on Saturday,
Almutawakel could be headed for the Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Almutawakel, owned by the Godolphin Stable of Sheikh Mohammed
and his brothers, is going into this race much as he did for that
victory in Dubai. The only difference is that he has had two
workouts in front of the clockers at Belmont. His trial race in the
desert was conducted in the usual shrouded circumstances that the
remote location of Dubai provides.
</P>
<P>
   And rather than head into the Woodward with a significant
turf-course victory like he had before Dubai, Almutawakel's last
race was a dud over the grass in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``His action, you could see, he's happier on the dirt than he is
on the turf,'' trainer Saeed bin Suroor said. ``The faster ground
is what he liked.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the question is this: Can he be happy in a hurricane?
The remnants of Hurricane Floyd forced Belmont to cancel its racing
card yesterday. But officials with the track contend they'll be
open Saturday even with the accumulation of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey has been up for the horse's recent workouts, and
he's named to ride Almutawakel in the Woodward. But not a whole lot
can be taken from that. Bailey also was the rider on the
Godolphin-owned Worldly Manner when he ran out of gas at the
Kentucky Derby this year.

   MET-EGYPT-EXHIBIT (New York) _ A major show of Old Kingdom art,
now at the Metropolitan, easily gets the early vote for blockbuster
of the fall season. Organized at the museum by Dorothea Arnold and
handsomely installed, it's one of those spectacles, like the
Byzantine, Chinese and Mexican surveys that the Met has done in
recent years, that is not just about art but about a whole
civilization. It examines the first great epoch in Egypt, the 500
years from 2650 B.C. to 2150 B.C., which is really the high point
of all ancient Egyptian culture, when the pyramids were built and
the canon of Egyptian art was established. As well as any show, it

   COWARD-CENTENNIAL (New York) _ Noel Coward, the playwright,
actor, composer, fiction writer and cabaret star who would have
turned 100 on Dec. 16, did indeed love being attractive. It was an
essential part of his art, and in his later years he could never
understand the young actors who made a point of looking unkempt.
Star quality, as the critic Kenneth Tynan wrote, was Coward's Holy
Grail, a trait of which he said happily, ``I don't know what it is,
but I know I've got it.'' And to allow stellar light to dim or
tarnish was to him a grave act of irresponsibility. The
celebrations surrounding the Coward centennial this fall, which
range from film and television festivals to New York productions of
two of his late works (``Waiting in the Wings,'' ``Noel Coward in
Two Keys''), bear witness to the staying power of this impeccably
maintained persona. They also speak of the stamina of a man who
entered show business as an 11-year-old child actor and never
really left it until his death in 1973, refusing to let his public
image sag even as his critical and popular reputations yo-yoed
exasperatingly. By Ben Brantley.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
As October gets closer, two things are virtual guarantees in
baseball: The pennant races heat up, and talk about individual
honors can be heard from the water cooler to the airwaves.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With each victory on the mound, the case becomes stronger. Every
home run and clutch performance makes it tougher to overlook a
player.
</P>
<P>
   And as the Astros continue winning, the respect only grows.
</P>
<P>
   While the team's goal is to be remembered for what it
accomplishes in October, Baseball Writers Association of America
voters may find it difficult to forget the Astros when evaluating
candidates for the National League's Most Valuable Player, Cy Young
and Manager of the Year awards.
</P>
<P>
   Voting for those awards is done when the season ends; the
announcement of the winners comes after the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Astros' nominees is giving postseason awards a
thought. Their sights are set on a bigger prize _ a trip to the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think about that kind of stuff,'' said Jeff
Bagwell, perhaps the leading candidate to win the league's MVP
award. ``That's not up for me to decide. My focus day in and day
out is doing what I can to help this team win. MVP stuff is great
to talk about after the season.''
</P>
<P>
   In 37 years, the Houston franchise has won only five major
individual awards.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell is the only Astro to win an MVP (1994) or Rookie of the
Year (1991). Mike Scott was the 1986 Cy Young winner. Hal Lanier
(1986) and Larry Dierker (1998) were voted the league's best
managers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, besides Bagwell's contention for the MVP, Mike
Hampton, Jose Lima and Billy Wagner will get consideration for the
Cy Young. Dierker will get votes for Manager of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   What are the chances of an Astros sweep of the top two honors?
Not since 1991, when Atlanta's Terry Pendleton won the MVP and Tom
Glavine was the Cy Young winner, has a team swept the NL's top
awards.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the races:
</P>
<P>
   MVP &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There may never be another season like 1994 was for Bagwell,
when everything fell into place. That has not been the case this
season as a laundry list of Astros injuries forced Bagwell and
Craig Biggio to shoulder much of the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take Bagwell out of our lineup, and we're in last place,''
Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell has provided leadership and the club's dominant bat. He
leads the NL in runs scored (130) and walks (133) and is second in
on-base percentage (.451), tied for third in home runs (40), tied
for fifth in RBIs (116) and sixth in slugging percentage (.603).
</P>
<P>
   Through the first three months, most of his numbers were on par
with his previous MVP season. And the possibility of the Astros'
winning a third straight NL Central title will help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely the MVP, to me, has to be Baggy,'' Biggio said.
``From the standpoint of the way the season has gone with all the
injuries, the numbers he is putting up are pretty unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some voters might penalize Bagwell for his offensive drop-off
the past six weeks, although it was unlikely he could maintain his
early pace all season. Since Aug. 1, Bagwell has hit only five home
runs and driven in 22 runs. His average, though, has dipped only 12
points to .306.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a shot, but we'll have to win our division and he'll
have to have a strong finish,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   The only roadblock between Bagwell and a second MVP award might
be Braves third baseman Chipper Jones. Like Bagwell, Jones has been
the driving force behind the Braves, who have endured their own
long list of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has put together a terrific year with a .322 average and a
career-high 40 home runs. He is the first Brave to score 100 runs
in four straight seasons since Henry Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Individual accomplishments determine the bulk of the voting, but
this race might be affected by what happens down the stretch. Both
the Astros and the Braves are involved in tight division races.
</P>
<P>
   Reigning MVP Sammy Sosa has an outside chance of repeating. The
argument for Sosa is that no player has had back-to-back seasons
with 60 or more home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Cy Young &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Has there been a more consistent pitcher than Mike Hampton?
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest strikes against Hampton in the past was his
inability to put two solid halves together. So how does he shed
that reputation? By being perfect in the second half. Hampton, 27,
is riding an 11-game winning streak, tops in the majors this
season, and has not lost since June 24 in compiling a 20-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   His .870 winning percentage ranks as the fourth-highest in
history among lefthanders to win 20 games, trailing only Ron Guidry
(25-3, 1978), Lefty Grove (31-4, 1931) and Preacher Roe (22-3,
1951).
</P>
<P>
   Hampton has not lost consecutive starts, and the Astros are 26-4
in his 30 starts. Nine of his wins have followed an Astros loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go with Hampton based on his winning percentage and
what he brings to the table, not that Lima doesn't bring anything
to the table,'' said Wagner, whose name has surfaced because of his
club-record-tying 36 saves, 1.70 ERA and 115 strikeouts in 69
innings. ``It's going to be a close race.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima, also a 20-game winner, was hugely popular with writers at
the All-Star Game and has done nothing since to hurt his chances. A
brief lull when he went nearly a month without a victory kept his
statistics from being even better. His .741 winning percentage
(20-7) is second in the NL only to Hampton's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the Cy Young would be incredible,'' said Lima, who is
36-15 over the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for Lima: He has shown the ability to be the anchor
of the staff and does everything a manager craves in a pitcher. He
works deep into games. He issues few walks. And he is not afraid to
pitch in big-game situations.
</P>
<P>
   A problem that could arise from having two candidates _ or even
three _ from the same team is the possibility of dividing the
votes, which would help the chances of pitchers like Arizona's
Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Big Unit needs any help.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dominant pitchers of his era, Johnson has been
largely responsible for getting the Diamondbacks to the brink of
postseason play in their second year of existence. He is the
runaway leader in the majors with 335 strikeouts, surpassing his
career high of 329 set last year.
</P>
<P>
   He leads both leagues in innings pitched at 250 and complete
games with 11. He leads the NL with a 2.52 ERA. A sore shoulder,
however, makes Johnson a long shot to break Nolan Ryan's
26-year-old record of 383 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has only three more starts and would need to average
over 16 strikeouts a game to reach 383.
</P>
<P>
   Probably no statistic is more misleading than Johnson's 15-9
record.
</P>
<P>
   In seven of those losses, his teammates failed to provide him
with more than two runs, including a stretch when the Diamondbacks
were shut out in four of his starts in a row. In those four
defeats, Johnson had an ERA of 1.41. But he knows everything goes
back to victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is based on winning, not strikeouts, not ERA, because
ERAs are so inflated now they aren't even really talked about
anymore,'' Johnson said. ``But wins are, and wins are how I'm
evaluated at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite solid numbers _ he has more saves (36) than hits allowed
(31) and is averaging 15.1 strikeouts per nine innings _ Wagner
won't get much consideration in a category usually dominated by
starters.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, San Diego's Trevor Hoffman had 53 saves and finished
as runner-up to Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, depending on how things fall, Wagner could get
himself into the Cy Young picture,'' Dierker said. ``If he gets
another six saves and keeps his ERA and strikeout/walk ratio the
way they are, you could put him alongside any of the starting
pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were voting, I would have to consider him.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Voters tend to sympathize with managers who have exceeded
expectations or overcome adversity.
</P>
<P>
   After three seasons, Dierker, who managed the Astros to their
finest season in 1998 (102-60), has been subjected to more scrutiny
regarding decision-making. His task this season has been even more
difficult with all the injuries the Astros have suffered and
Dierker's own personal battle.
</P>
<P>
   He collapsed with a seizure during a game in June and two days
later had brain surgery. Dierker was back in the dugout a month
later.
</P>
<P>
   But everybody loves the underdog _ and Cincinnati's venerable
Jack McKeon should get plenty of support. McKeon has kept the Reds
in the chase the entire season and is attempting to take the club
to the playoffs for the first time since 1995.

ARUM PLAYED KEY ROLE IN DE LA HOYA'S SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oscar De La Hoya would be a dream come true for any
boxing promoter.
</P>
<P>
   He's got it all: talent, an Olympic gold medal, charisma, good
looks, class and, not to be underestimated, Mexican-American
heritage. Obviously, his success is no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   He'd be the first to admit he couldn't have done it alone,
though. He had a partner: promoter Bob Arum. Together they have
built De La Hoya into the biggest thing in boxing today.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this fight,'' said De La Hoya's agent, Bruce Binko,
referring to Saturday's welterweight title unification bout against
Felix Trinidad, ``he'll be even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of guys like (Tiger) Woods, (Michael) Jordan, guys who
are ubiquitous in the public consciousness. That's never been done
by a fighter before.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum, in the twilight of his career, has had his share of
success.
</P>
<P>
   He worked some with Muhammad Ali, played a key role during the
peak years of Sugar Ray Leonard's career and helped Marvin Hagler,
a relatively unknown middleweight out of Brockton, Mass., become
something of an international figure.
</P>
<P>
   But De La Hoya, he says, is his masterpiece because ``I've had
him since he was a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, a baby in terms of his professional career. The two teamed
up after the fighter became the only American boxer to win a gold
medal in the 1992 Olympics and touched everyone's heart by
dedicating it to his late mother.
</P>
<P>
   Arum then made a game plan and set about creating an idol.
</P>
<P>
   His secret? Only common sense. He exploited to the fullest De La
Hoya's natural crossover appeal _ in the Latin and general markets
_ and he matched the fighter oh-so-carefully against opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing was realizing he was a crossover guy,'' Arum
said. ``It was very important to maintain his Hispanic roots, to
always keep his Hispanic identity at the forefront while also
crossing over to the Anglo market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Latino market _ particularly the Mexican market _ is by far
the most committed to boxing. Put simply, the sport would cease to
be viable without its pay-per-view buys.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Arum focused his marketing in Southern California and
the Southwest, areas with large Latino populations. For example,
he's staged promotional events and had De La Hoya fight in such
unlikely places as El Paso and San Antonio to tremendous
receptions.
</P>
<P>
   He held a news conference at Olvera Street before the second
fight with Julio Cesar Chavez. Mariachi bands popped up everywhere,
Mexican food was served at every function, the Mexican national
anthem was sung at De La Hoya's fights even when no Mexican
national was fighting and more.
</P>
<P>
   Arum didn't miss a detail.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, De La Hoya, who has always had a strong Mexican
identity, has done his part: Speaking both languages in public,
wearing trunks emblazoned with both the American and Mexican flags,
appearing regularly on Spanish-language television and simply
making it clear that he's proud of his heritage.
</P>
<P>
   He also is wonderful with the media _ in both languages _ which
is the key to bringing him to those who can't see him in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at him,'' Arum said of De La Hoya, who was conducting one
interview after another on a grueling day at his Big Bear training
camp recently. ``How many fighters would be willing to do this?
This kid is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   All that, as well as those knock-em-dead looks and charm, have
produced phenomenal results.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking example might be the reaction of teen-age
girls, particularly those of Mexican decent. They idolize him. A
scene in El Paso before the first Chavez fight was typical: He was
mobbed by hundreds of screaming girls a la the Beatles, something
unheard of in boxing before De La Hoya came on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   And while others might not swoon at the sight of him, they
certainly support him. No one outside the lucrative heavyweight
division can create the stir he creates.
</P>
<P>
   Television insiders are expecting around 1million pay-per-view
buys for Saturday's bout _ which would smash the record of 760,000
_ even though Trinidad is hardly a household name.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the time of Sugar Ray Leonard has a non-heavyweight
taken such a firm hold on the public. Leonard, for one, is
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a guy in Oscar De La Hoya who can transcend the sport of
boxing, take it to another level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he's nothing if he doesn't win. And win he does.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has blasted his way through one opponent after
another and indelibly into the public consciousness. He's a perfect
31-0, only 26 years old and already considered one of the greatest
and most exciting fighters of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   And while Arum doesn't throw punches, he has played a key role
here, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tricky business, choosing the right opponent. Generally,
you want the most profit for the least risk while not moving the
fighter so slowly that the public loses interest.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard, Arum and others in De La Hoya's inner circle
have performed almost flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya was criticized early in his career for selecting
opponents who were moving up in weight or over the hill. All the
while, Arum repeatedly promised that his fighter would face them
all.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday, even his harshest critics must admit, he will
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob has done an amazing job bringing Oscar along,'' said
promoter Don King, Arum's longtime and not-always-friendly rival.
``... Oscar wasn't a great fighter in the beginning. He was an
amateur who had had some success. It's Bob carefully selecting his
opponents and promoting him that brought his guy to where he is
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Where is he? In a very high tax bracket, which is the most
amazing element to all of this.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is expected to earn more than $20 million for
Saturday's bout, which would put him over $100million for his
seven-year career. Only Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson among
active fighters have made more.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, De La Hoya was the third-highest paid athlete in the
world (including endorsements) at $38 million over five fights.
Last year, he was seventh at $18.5 in two fights.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with an impressive collection of endorsement deals,
he's expected to be No. 1 _ ahead of Woods, ahead of Andre Agassi,
ahead of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Binko said he'd have to go to his files to list all of his
client's sponsors. McDonalds, Met-Rx nutritional supplements, Puma,
Logo Athletic and Budweiser are among them. And that's about all he
can handle; Binko doesn't want to saturate the market.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy in a sport with a lousy image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been doubly difficult for him in a sport that
continually steps on (its) own foot,'' Binko said. ``He also
doesn't have a marketing machine behind him, like the NBA or NFL.
That's why what Oscar has done from a marketing standpoint is very
significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's paved a road for boxers who will come after him,
he's opened a lot of doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is perfect, not even De La Hoya's career.
</P>
<P>
   Arum admitted as much. The fighter's early alliance with
co-managers Robert Mittleman and Steve Nelson _ with whom De La
Hoya was never comfortable _ was one messy mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Arum now wishes he had done something to rein in adviser Mike
Hernandez, who was fired recently in part because he had attained
too much control of De La Hoya's career.
</P>
<P>
   And if Team De La Hoya had it do over again, it wouldn't have
created a revolving door for its trainers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, no one is complaining. Certainly not De La
Hoya, who has seen many people come and go since the start of his
career but wouldn't think of letting Arum go.
</P>
<P>
   As proof, De La Hoya gave Arum something near and dear to his
heart on the latter's 60th birthday and 30th year in the boxing
business: his gold medal. The touching gesture sealed a bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no promoter who's better at marketing a fighter and
promoting a fighter and exposing a fighter to the world,'' De La
Hoya said. ``... Say you have a great talent, an undefeated
fighter. Take Trinidad, for instance. He's not where I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? Because he's not with Bob Arum. He's lifted my career to
a higher leve levery year.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum could have said the exact same thing.

FOR MANY NEW YORKERS, STORM WAS MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To a large extent, the city hid. It wasn't always
clear from what.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Hurricane Floyd was supposed to roar into town on Thursday
and topple buildings and catapult buses over the Empire State
Building. But where was it?
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, it rained hard. Then it rained less hard. By
early afternoon, it didn't rain at all. Then it rained pretty hard,
and then it didn't. Rain, of course, is something New Yorkers can
usually handle adeptly. A city that prides itself on preparing for
almost anything hates to get apprehensive for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, in keeping with the urgings of the mayor, when
Conde Nast told its employees they could go home at noon, Joe
Tobin, 30, who works in marketing, kept slogging away, not at all
worried that if he left later he'd be blown to Michigan. Finally,
when the place was almost vacant, he left around 2:30 to go home to
Hoboken, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over-rated,'' was his summation of Floyd. ``I'm not
surprised,'' he said. ``This is just weather. What's the biggest
thing that's going to happen _ my bus is going to get delayed a
little?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a particularly great day to be a kid. No school and yet
your apartment didn't collapse.
</P>
<P>
   It was bizarre waiting for refugees at the array of emergency
shelters set up in the city. The school safety officers assigned to
Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Queens, one of the designated
shelters, lit up when a reporter wandered in. She was the first
person they had seen all day. All these cots and blankets from the
Red Cross, and zero people. ``It's a slow day,'' acknowledged Jean
Louis, one of the officers.
</P>
<P>
   But tell all this to some of the people in New Jersey. There,
especially in the northern part of the state, it was like another
world, and a very soggy one. Roads were rivers. Power lines were
down. In Hackensack, scuba divers had to rescue motorists trapped
in flooded cars. And widespread flooding continued in Bergen
County, N.J., and in Rockland County, N.Y., well after the brunt of
the storm had passed.
</P>
<P>
   There was also flooding in Connecticut and on Long Island, and
people were evacuated along the tip of the island. Metro-North was
forced to suspend service for part of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The day the hurricane came was very much one of pointed
contrasts in the metropolitan area, with portions of the region
being overwhelmed, while parts of the city found itself largely
tricked by a rather ephemeral event.
</P>
<P>
   There were certainly instances of hardship even in New York.
Highways were closed part of the day. In the Rosedale section of
Queens, the rainfall was persistent enough to flood basements and
make streets difficult to navigate. Horace and Venetia Ferguson had
two feet of water in their basement. They had bought the brick town
house new only five months ago. &UR;  &LR;  ``Everything is floating down
there,'' Ferguson said. The water had ruined his computer, his
exercise equipment, a number of unpacked boxes of clothing and
thousands of dollars worth of cloth and sewing notions that his
wife needed in her work as a clothing designer and seamstress.
</P>
<P>
   One of the oddities of the day was the parade of sightseers who
reported to the beaches in some of the more precarious areas to
gawk at the weather. A group of hardy ones walked along the beach
in Spring Lake, N.J., 10-foot waves crashing mere yards from them
as red, no-swimming flags flapped on crooked poles. During the
afternoon, dozens of others strolled along the boardwalk at Point
Pleasant Beach _ middle-aged couples, toddlers, teen-agers in their
bare feet.
</P>
<P>
   Sandi and Herb Gomberg drove the 40 minutes from their home in
Freehold, N.J., with their neighbors, Harold and Marie Berg. ``It's
just awesome,'' Mrs. Gomberg said. ``The angriness of the sea is
something awesome you'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, there were a lot of pre-emptive strikes against the
storm that did not always seem like a storm. The mayor sent home
early nonessential city workers, and recommended that private
businesses close down well before normal hours. Many did, making
for an unusual mid-day rush. Many businesses, though, would have
none of this. Paying no heed to winds and rain, the Four Seasons
stayed open for dinner like it was just another night. ``Look,
these are New York people,'' said Julian Niccolini, one of the
restaurant's partners. ``This is just a little water.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools didn't open across the region. It was the first time in
memory that the city's school were closed for a hurricane scare,
and by the time the normal dismissal hour rolled along, many
children must have been wondering whether they had gotten away with
some sort of collective prank.
</P>
<P>
   Parents found themselves lugging children to work, often only to
turn around after a few hours and be sent home. Caregivers on Call,
a provider of emergency home care for children and the elderly on
Long Island, said it had dispatched a number of caregivers to homes
to look after a child only to be beaten there by the parents after
their offices closed.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the liberated children found many useful ways to
occupy themselves. Dakota Eisenberg, 10, who lives in Brooklyn,
spent the day chewing on taffy bars and seeing the movie, ``The
Muse,'' with her best friend, Aminah Shor. Albert Watkins, 11, also
of Brooklyn, actually wanted to go to school. ``I just stayed home
and occupied the dog,'' he said.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. LOUIS _ Excuse the dust while we renovate for your convenience.
</P>
<P>
   This whole case-building for Mike Hampton as a contender for the
National League Cy Young Award should be redone. Completely remade.
Revised. Overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   Take out a wall, and start over. Strip the paneling, and pull up
the carpets. Even rewire _ 220, 221, whatever it takes.
</P>
<P>
   If history is the only gauge by which we judge legitimate Cy
Young candidates, then it should be Diamondbacks pitcher Randy
Johnson begging his case, not Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   If all these Johnson supporters would only look at the record
books they have been clinging to so dearly in pushing him for the
Cy Young, then they would realize this: The Astros should have the
Cy Young leader in the clubhouse, and it should be Johnson knocking
on the door hoping voters see things his way.
</P>
<P>
   Turn to the pages that list the 1973 pitching statistics. If you
recall, it was in 1973 when Nolan Ryan established the strikeout
record _ 383 _ with which Johnson has flirted all season.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan didn't win the American League Cy Young in 1973. Ryan even
had a 21-win season in '73, something Johnson will not come close
to as he stands 15-9, with a tired shoulder. Ryan also had an
unbelievable 26 complete games, a 2.87 ERA and 326 innings pitched
in '73.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't win the Cy Young.
</P>
<P>
   The AL award in 1973 went to Jim Palmer because Palmer was then
what Hampton is now. He was a control pitcher who didn't give up a
lot of hits, worked out of jams and was at his best down the
stretch drive for a division-winning team.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer had 158 strikeouts _ less than half of Ryan's total. Yet
today, Cy Young voters are enamored with the dominance Johnson has
shown with the strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   It indeed has been an impressive statistic for Johnson, and the
argument is that Johnson's strikeout totals so overwhelm the
nearest contender that you can't help but give him the Cy Young.
</P>
<P>
   Is that so? Voters need to look closer at statistics and records
and overhaul that line of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest strikeout total to Ryan's 383 in 1973 was Bert
Blyleven's 258, a dominating difference of 125. Johnson is at 335
strikeouts, and his nearest competition is the Dodgers' Kevin Brown
at 197, a difference of 138.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Johnson's dominance with strikeouts this year is not
all that different from Ryan's in 1973. Ryan had a similar gap and
didn't win the Cy Young.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, Johnson will not break Ryan's record this year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the records that should count for voters are those
Hampton stands to break. You define Cy Young numbers your way, I do
it this way.
</P>
<P>
   A Cy Young winner should be just that _ a winner; someone who
takes the field and does more than any other pitcher in the league
to help his team win. Fielding, leadership, hitting.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of hitting, that's why the Astros' Jose Lima
(20-7, 3.36 ERA) also should be a legitimate candidate, especially
if Hampton and Johnson falter down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one statistic that might distinguish Hampton (20-3,
2.81) above all others and might also have slipped through the
cracks for most Cy Young voters.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton is in line to become the first major-league pitcher to
win at least 20 games and bat .300 since Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter
accomplished the feat in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's batting average is .288. He is in line to break club
records for pitchers for triples (he has three, tied for the
record), hits (19, with the record being 22) and total bases (28,
with the record at 31).
</P>
<P>
   As the Astros head to St. Louis to open a three-game set today,
not only is Hampton looking for his 21st win Saturday, but a
2-for-3 day at the plate would raise his batting average to .314.
Even if he goes 1-for-3, a more likely scenario, Hampton's batting
average will improve to .290 with at least a couple of more starts
left.
</P>
<P>
   There's an old saying in baseball about the secret to playing a
great right field: Swing that bat.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps hitting isn't the first thing Cy Young voters should
consider when scrutinizing a pitcher's performance for the
prestigious award. But if it's complementary records that are the
gauge _ such as strikeouts _ perhaps they should revamp their
thinking there, too.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't even be a contest. If Hampton keeps winning at an
.870 clip it should be his, especially if he heeds one more bit of
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Swing that bat.
</P>

DODGERS NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BROWN'S GOOD YEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Don Sutton won 108 games after the age of 35.
Gaylord Perry won 21 games when he was 40. Steve Carlton won 23 at
38 and Jack Morris won 21 at 37.
</P>
<P>
   They are the exceptions, the rare individuals who excel and can
be the ace of a staff in the twilight of their career. They prove
it is possible to be dominant late in their baseball life.
</P>
<P>
   Their accomplishments make it possible to believe right-hander
Kevin Brown could still be the Los Angeles Dodgers' ace, and one of
the top pitchers in baseball, during the final few seasons of his
seven-year, $105million contract.
</P>
<P>
   But to think the 34-year-old Brown, one of the elite pitchers
the past four seasons, will continue to pitch at a high level at
the conclusion of his contract may be a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers signed him for seven years, but that doesn't
accurately depict the window of opportunity the club has to win a
championship with Brown as their ace. That time frame is
continuously closing. A year without a championship is a year
closer to that window shutting.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is 16-8 with a 2.99 ERA. Though it doesn't hold any
significance for the Dodgers, Brown is also pitching his best as
the playoffs near. He reeled off seven consecutive wins before a
loss to the Mets last week and is 6-2 with a 1.66 ERA in his past
11 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you expect him to be pitching the way he's been pitching
this year for seven years?'' Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros
said. ``History says there aren't too many starters who are No.1
starters when they are 36 or 37. We've already wasted one year. The
next two years are going to be pretty important.''
</P>
<P>
   In those two years, upon completion of which Brown will be 36,
the Dodgers must develop players in the organization who can help
when injuries hit, find a left-handed power hitter and develop a
bullpen, bench and depth in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention find a way and the funds to keep Chan Ho Park,
Darren Dreifort and Ismael Valdes with the club since all will be
eligible for free agency in the next few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nothing I even worry about,'' Brown said. ``You control
what you can control. All I can control is how I do my job. I don't
have a crystal ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's been considered one of the top pitchers in baseball
since he went 17-11 with a 1.89 ERA in 1996 with the Florida
Marlins. He led them to the World Series title the next season and
then pitched San Diego into the World Series last season before
entering the free-agent market.
</P>
<P>
   He's in his fourth year of socializing with the elite pitchers
in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Greg Maddux, 33, began his run as the game's best
pitcher in 1992. Even though he's third in the NL with 18 wins,
he's clearly not the same pitcher this season as he was during his
Cy Young days.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens, 36, won back-to-back Cy Young Awards with Toronto
but has fallen off markedly this season with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   So when Fox committed to Brown for seven years, many people in
baseball spoke up against it not only for making Brown the game's
first $100million player, but also because he'll be 40 years old
and making $15million when the contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown presumably takes the mound for next season's opener
in Montreal, he will be 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about one day at a time,'' said Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson, who has a three-year deal. ``That's not part of my job
description.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like Johnson doesn't believe Brown's job description should
include molding a young, inexperienced group of starters into one
of the premier staffs in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, by his own admission, said he tried to do too much early
in the season. Partly because of the contract, and partly because
that's what everyone thought he would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys have been getting better and some guys haven't,''
Johnson said. ``That isn't his responsibility. I think, for me, his
responsibility is to do his thing. It's not to carry the weight of
everybody on the staff. You can't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Barry) Larkin tried to do that in Cincinnati and (Cal) Ripken
tried to do it in Baltimore. You have to do your own thing, by
example. I didn't like the talk he was going to make everybody
better. Yeah, he makes everybody better, but just by doing things
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone sold Fox execs Chase Carey and Peter Chernin on the idea
of giving a pitcher a rare seven-year deal. But when he did it he
had a secondary plan.
</P>
<P>
   First, and foremost, Malone wants Brown to be a starter for the
length of the contract. But if Brown succumbs to age and loses his
effectiveness as a starter, Malone has another thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if he's one quality closer,'' Malone
said. ``I think he'll be in a premium, quality role (when his
contract expires). I can see him being a closer. I can see that
down the road. Because of who he is, his approach, I think that
might be a real possibility.''

JACKSON TAPPED FOR TWO POSITIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He's the No. 2 fullback. Or the No. 3 tailback.
Thanks to injuries, Jabari Jackson will have to play two positions
Saturday against San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine with Jackson, who is happy to have any
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have about three healthy runners,'' Jackson said.
``I've been trying to stay focused and stay patient. Now I'm
getting an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's tailback role has increased because Malaefou MacKenzie
is out with a hamstring injury and Frank Strong is doubtful after
being hobbled with a bruised knee.
</P>
<P>
   He'll also back up Brennan Ochs at fullback, because Chad
Pierson is out with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down to three tailbacks and two fullbacks,'' Hackett
said. ``He's going to have to play more tailback now. Or play
fullback if we need him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson gained a career-high 31 yards in six carries against
Hawaii, a satisfying performance after redshirting in 1997 and
barely playing in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt awesome,'' Jackson said ``A million years, it felt
like I waited. But I can't worry about the past. The last game I
had some rust. It was good for me to dust off the cobwebs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lineup change: Cornerback Kris Richard will not start Saturday,
after missing the past two practices with a sore hamstring. Richard
will play, however, according to Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be in there,'' Hackett said. ``He should be OK. They
say he'll be fine. Hamstrings are hamstrings.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Tanqueray Clark is the likely starter in place of
Richard; a decision will be made today.
</P>
<P>
   A doubtful group: Several players are being listed as doubtful
for the game after missing practice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Strong remains out with a bruised knee and wide receiver Steve
Stevenson is bothered by a sprained arch. If Stevenson is out, USC
will be down to four healthy scholarship receivers: R. Jay Soward,
Windrell Hayes, Kareem Kelly and Marcell Allmond.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Darrell Rideaux (stress fracture) practiced Thursday
and Hackett said he is 85-90 percent recovered.
</P>
<P>
   No line changes: There will be no changes along the offensive
line, but junior center Eric Denmon appears to have solidified his
starting role over senior Matt McShane. Last year, the two split
the center position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to keep Denmon with Carson (Palmer) at least through
the first quarter,'' offensive-line coach Steve Greatwood said.
``The biggest thing is having somebody that Carson feels
comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   The move of senior Travis Claridge from guard to tackle also
will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he played very well,'' Greatwood said. ``I was very
pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowd count: About 60,000 are expected at the Coliseum for
Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Hawley supporter:!off! Hackett said he was impressed with
San Diego State quarterback Jack Hawley, a transfer from L.A.
Harbor College, who will make his first start Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a stronger arm (than previous starter Brian Russell),
looks like he has more mobility, he's a natural,'' Hackett said.
``Things are faster at this level, though. That's the problem he
will have.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett also helped motivate Hawley this week, by referring to
him as ``Hawkley'' in a teleconference with San Diego reporters.

MANNING READY FOR HIGH SCHOOL REUNION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA freshman cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. is
unusually excited about Saturday's game against Fresno State, and
not because it's his first career start.
</P>
<P>
   Manning is a Fresno native. He'll have 10 family members in
attendance and a slew of supporters in the Bulldogs' cheering
section. He also has 11 friends or former Edison High teammates on
Fresno State's roster, including receivers Paris Gaines and Atnaf
Harris, whom he'll probably face in man-to-man coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more amped this week than the two previous weeks,''
Manning said. ``It's great and it'll be a great game. I know these
guys can play and I'm going to tell my (UCLA) teammates about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning will start at right cornerback in place of senior Jason
Bell, who's out with an injured heel. Based on Manning's
performance to date _ he leads UCLA with five tackles-for-loss _ it
should be the first of many starts.
</P>
<P>
   From Kenny Easley to Eric Turner, Don Rogers and Shaun Williams,
the Bruins have produced a plethora of All-American defensive
backs. Manning's in their class, at least as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as talented and tough as any of the better players we've
had come through the program as freshmen,'' longtime defensive
coach Bob Field said. ``Now, will he develop like the other ones?
We'll see.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not without flaws, but he's done a remarkable job
learning and he competes at a high level. He's not cautious and
he's instinctive. He never backs down.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even from friends.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel stuff: Receiver Danny Farmer is questionable because
of a sprained left ankle suffered in training camp and re-injured
Wednesday. Toledo said Farmer's availability will be a game-time
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's replacement, Freddie Mitchell, has a sprained left knee
but should play.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle and captain Pete Holland will not play because
of a disc injury to his lower back. Sophomore Anthony Fletcher will
start in Holland's place alongside Ken Kocher. Steve Morgan becomes
the No. 3 tackle, Kory Lombard the No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve linebacker Ali Abdul Azziz (sprained neck) will play.
</P>
<P>
   Turner update: Defensive end Travor Turner, out for the season
with torn knee ligaments, said he will seek a medical redshirt
allowing him to play next season.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, from Westchester, used his standard redshirt year in
1995. If the NCAA approves a sixth season, he'll play as a graduate
student.
</P>
<P>
   Review of the week: Holland, a history major and six-time member
of the director's honor roll, has agreed to review a book each week
for the Daily News. This week: ``The Day After Tomorrow'' by Allan
Folsom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book, Folsom's first, rises to the top of the espionage
and world-domination novels swamping bookstores everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Osborn, a Pacific Palisades orthopedist, is in Paris to
deliver a speech, and he finds himself in a smoky
 &UR; !ital! &LR; brasserie &UR; !off! &LR; . Although 30 years have passed, he suddenly
spots the man who murdered his father. His mission is to learn who
and why. Then comes page two. As Osborn's quest continues, he
uncovers a conspiracy that stretches over the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The carefully wrought and intertwining tale of secrets and
ambition careens towards its resolution, which is told in the final
sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: Four sacks out of four.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: The Bruins are averaging 33.8 net yards per
punt, which usually reflects field position. That's sixth in the
Pacific-10.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is eighth in the conference in turnover margin, at
minus-0.5.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have converted 43 percent of their third-down
opportunities _ third-best in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's top four receivers (Farmer, Mitchell, Brad Melsby and
Brian Poli-Dixon) have caught a mere 13 passes.
</P>
<P>
   After two games, the Bruins have 22 tackles-for-loss. In 12
games last year, they had 81.

<P>
   AUSTIN _ Facial expressions are soundless.
</P>
<P>
   However, fire the following question, or others on the same
subject, toward Texas coach Mack Brown, and you can practically
hear the response, though the muscles in his face manage only to
move his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with your running game?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's eyes scream out, ``Are you nuts?''
</P>
<P>
   For a team that is 2-1 and should be 3-0, questions that begin
with ``what's wrong with '' don't often go over well.
</P>
<P>
   But for a team that lost the most productive collegiate running
back of all time and four of the five offensive linemen who cleared
the way for him, ``what's wrong'' and ``running game'' probably
should not be in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with the Texas running game that Ricky
Williams, Ben Adams, Jay Humphrey, Octavious Bishop and Russell
Gaskamp couldn't fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the guy (Williams) who ran for more yards and scored
more touchdowns than anybody in history and the guy (Wane McGarity)
who caught more passes for more yards than any receiver in school
history (in a single season),'' Brown said. ``Plus four linemen and
an All-Big 12 tight end (Derek Lewis). Most of that offense from
last year is now playing on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be reasonable to assume our running game this year
would not be as good as it was last year, especially early in the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   That reasonable assumption is a verifiable fact.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is off to a slow start on the ground. A very slow start.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns are averaging 125 yards rushing per game, which
ranks them 76th in the country. If the average holds throughout the
season, it will be the fourth-lowest in school history behind 1938
(80.1), 1944 (102.1) and 1937 (116.6). The combined record of those
three teams was 8-18-1.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is last in the Big 12 in rushing, 41 yards per game behind
Oklahoma (166.0) and a whopping 247 yards per game behind league
leader Iowa State, which has averaged 372 yards in two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns' numbers do not figure to get drastically better
this week with Rice coming to town. The Owls have given up just 114
rushing yards per game in losses to Houston and Michigan, and their
defense is 29th in the nation in total yards allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Texas pounded Rice for 434 yards on the ground last
year on its way to a school-record 692-yard performance. Williams
led the way with 318 yards and six touchdowns in the 59-21 victory.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a new year and a new Texas team.
</P>
<P>
   Tailbacks Hodges Mitchell and Victor Ike have shown flashes of
brilliance, but overall the two have been less than spectacular in
their effort to succeed a Heisman Trophy winner.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, both entered the season with their first real
opportunity at playing time. Mitchell played sparingly in two
seasons, picking up 203 yards on 37 career carries. Ike, a redshirt
freshman, didn't have a carry before this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one of those guys is ready to take every snap in a
ballgame like Ricky,'' Brown has said since the beginning of
two-a-days.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seems the two are continually compared to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit unfair, but that's why you get recruited,
for situations like this,'' said Mitchell, who matched his career
high with 50 yards against Rice a year ago. ``When a great back
leaves, somebody has to step up, and Victor and I are trying to
make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to be patient, because sooner or later we'll get
it together and have that big game that'll stop everybody from
talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for them, while awaiting the big game, the
Longhorns' offense has not completely stalled, thanks to the play
of quarterback Major Applewhite.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore has Texas on pace to obliterate the school record
for passing yards in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is averaging 313.3 passing yards per game, a pace that
would give it 3,760 yards in 12 games. The Longhorns' record of
3,006 yards was set over 12 games in 1996. Their best average is
266.4 yards per game, achieved with Applewhite last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on in our passing game, but we can be even
better,'' Applewhite said. ``We haven't taken advantage of
everything we have seen, so we will continue to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   If the running game doesn't pick up, that improvement will be
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns had only 56 yards on 36 carries against North
Carolina. They rushed 39 times for 178 yards against Stanford (68
came on one carry by Chris Robertson late in the game) and gained
141 yards on 39 carries against Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns believe it will be only a matter of time before
the running game gets up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blocked for Ricky for over two years, and it's totally
different now,'' guard Roger Roesler said. ``It takes a few games
for the running backs to learn where the holes are and to learn our
style of blocking and how they want to cut off that. Whereas Ricky,
he knew that from experience, plus he was such a spectacular
athlete that even if he didn't hit the right hole, he was going to
make somebody miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell (5-7, 190 pounds) and Ike (5-11, 195) are a far cry
from the 240-pound load Williams carried during the season.
</P>
<P>
   They bring contrasting running styles _ from Williams and each
other _ to the field, making the adjustment a visual one as well as
a practical one. Fans may have gotten used to seeing Williams
barrel his way through the line for yards, an NCAA-record 6,279 to
be exact, but yardage for Mitchell and Ike will come in a different
way.
</P>
<P>
   While neither will look like Williams, Texas is counting on them
getting the job done.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is billed as the better inside runner and by far the
better blocker against blitzing linebackers. Ike, who set district
records as a high school star at Austin Bowie, has the speed of a
sprinter and is more elusive in the open field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tougher for them,'' Roesler said. ``You look at Hodges
and Victor, they're both great running backs, but neither one of
them is as big or as explosive as Ricky Williams was. Ricky
Williams is a great athlete, and we miss him, but you have to play
with what you've got.''
</P>
<P>
   With what they have, the Longhorns' offensive line needs to
jell, and in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Roesler, who plays right guard, is the lone returning starter,
though right tackle Leonard Davis saw plenty of action as a backup.
Davis, center Marcel Blanchard, left guard Antwan Kirk-Hughes and
left tackle Cory Quye each made his first start against N.C. State.
Davis started three games at defensive tackle as a freshman in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said it takes time to build enough confidence in an
offensive line to know that the lanes to run in will be there when
a back gets to the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we play with them, the more comfortable we'll be with
them,'' he said. ``As long as you trust the offensive linemen, and
believe there is always a hole somewhere, it will be easier for
you. Your job then is to simply go find it. You have to build that
trust, and that's what we're doing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take time for the running backs and linemen to get on
the same page.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the whole thing, not just the backs,'' Roesler said.
``What, we had four returning starters on the whole offense? It
will take some games to get everything together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the three games, I've seen where we've improved greatly.
I feel like it was the same way last year, even with Ricky back
there. You look at our early game against Kansas State, Ricky
Williams didn't gain many yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with our experience, we had mistakes on the offensive
line and missed blocks. It happens in college football. But we're
definitely coming together as a group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offensive line's mental errors have gone down. In the
first game we had 24 mental errors, whereas last week I believe we
had nine. That's still too many, but it's 15 less than we had three
weeks ago. That shows great improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   The improvement could be seen on the field, if not in the
statistics. Texas rushed for just 3.6 yards a carry but looked
better than it did the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Ike (94 yards on 17 carries) almost broke the 100-yard mark for
the first time, and fullback Ricky Brown had 39 yards on a
career-high-tying six carries.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was held to only 19 yards on nine attempts, but he
continued to contribute in the passing game (seven receptions for
88 yards on the season).
</P>
<P>
   ``Hodges has been more successful in the passing game, and
Victor has been more successful in the running game,'' Mack Brown
said. ``We probably need to get Chris Robertson and Kenny Hayter (a
freshman from Cypress Falls) in the game a little bit more. We're
still looking at what we are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said the Longhorns are close to putting the pieces
together and that when they do, the critics will have to run and
hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some great holes for Victor (against Rutgers), and he
was almost always one tackle from going the distance,'' Mitchell
said. ``If we find the holes, we can make something happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to make something happen whenever one of us
touches the ball. We need to start making big plays in the running
game so they'll respect us. When we get some offensive balance _
running and passing _ we'll be really, really hard to stop, just
like we were last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of us, or both of us, will have the game where we'll break
out, and that'll open some eyes and (critics will) back up off us a
little bit and maybe we'll get a little respect. Right now, even
though I know everybody is looking down on the running game, it's
not a problem for us. It's just making us practice harder to try
and get the job done on Saturdays.''

UNPROVEN MEN ON DEFENSE FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's an experiment going on at USC in which no
professor on campus would find much logic: You add several unproven
players, subtract a Butkus Award winner and hope it equals a better
defense.
</P>
<P>
   A farfetched theory. And as wacky as it sounded, oh, just three
weeks ago, USC now believes its defense could be stronger than last
year's, considered among the best in the Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   When you realize the Trojans replaced linebacker Chris Claiborne
(the Butkus Award winner), cornerback Daylon McCutcheon and free
safety Rashard Cook, the theory could strike some as arrogant. Or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense is proud that no one player has assumed a high
profile. It firmly believes it will be superior to last year's
successful group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was the offense, and you were losing an R. Jay Soward or
Carson Palmer, then it would sound crazy because offense is more
individual,'' free safety David Gibson said. ``But defense is a
collective effort. More guys are playing off each other. You don't
need a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be like those Miami Dolphins no-name defenses of the
'70s. I'd rather have everyone just do their job. If everyone does
their job, this defense can be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Not allowing Hawaii's offense to score a point raised
expectations, but the Rainbow Warriors are considered one of
Division I's worst teams. What really caused a re-evaluation of the
defense is the manner of the Trojans' shutout.
</P>
<P>
   USC newcomers had bigger games than anticipated, suddenly
running roughshod over the idea the defense would be this year's
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addition of a couple people _ (linebacker) Markus Steele,
(defensive end) Matt Childers _ has really boosted us up,''
defensive coordinator Bill Young said. ``And Gibson and (defensive
end) Ryan Nielsen, they're playing at a different level than a year
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Nielsen and Kansas State-transfer Childers, and
the unexpected contribution of converted tight end Lonnie Ford has
made the defensive line quicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed on this team is the fastest I've been around in four
years,'' said offensive tackle Travis Claridge. ``The defensive
ends are fast. The defensive tackles are fast.''
</P>
<P>
   What surprised the USC coaching staff was how quickly the
Trojans adapted their improved speed into game situations against
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't totally simulate the speed of the game,''
linebackers coach Shawn Slocum said. ``How fast we were impressed
me. We actually played that way. Just seeing the way guys broke on
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another reason everyone feels optimistic about the
defense. Although it's early, the players don't believe there will
be the same number of on-field arguments during games that
culminated during the loss to Texas Christian in the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We communicate better. That was a problem last year. We didn't
communicate,'' linebacker Zeke Moreno said. ``This year, a lot of
guys, especially after the TCU game, decided that wouldn't happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Gibson: ``I think we had too many mental errors. We had to
simplify the defense last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaches also feel more comfortable with the personnel,
although it would be foolish to think they wouldn't mind having
Claiborne and Co. back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year because we were all new, you don't know the
questions, much less the answers,'' Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a natural progression. As coaches, we're more on the
same page,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno believes a primary reason for the defense's success is
that nearly every player spent his summer in Los Angeles working
out, instead of going home.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are in shape. I can't explain it, but guys are just
working harder,'' Moreno said. ``We're not putting down last year's
team. They worked hard, too. But we're a lot more explosive. We
still have a lot of great players on this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe for the media or fans, it sounds weird, but not for
ourselves. We know what we're capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's plenty of time left for a dose of reality,
even if it's not likely to set in by playing San Diego State. USC
remains untested in the secondary _ although cornerback Kris
Richard had a nice debut _ and has yet to face a physical,
power-running team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got some growing to do,'' Slocum said. ``We'll
find out how good we are.''
</P>
<P>
   This defense must also remain injury-free. Already, injuries
have sidelined cornerbacks Darrell Rideaux (stress fracture) and
Kevin Arbet (sprained ankle), causing concern in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still very thin,'' Young said. ``That will be a concern
for us all season.''
</P>
<P>
   So will road games at Arizona and Notre Dame, not to mention
next week's visit to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   But the mere fact anyone is contemplating that this defense
could be superior to last year's probably demonstrates that the
lower preseason expectations possibly need to be revised.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not, people are just going to be surprised when they line
up against us,'' Moreno said.

GONZALEZ WAS FINE JOCKEY, AND BETTER MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Frank Garza could teach J.C. Gonzalez how to ride.
And how to fall.
</P>
<P>
   What he couldn't teach him was luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going down,'' said the operator of the Frank Garza
Jockey School in Newbury Park, ``you curl up and roll, and hope
nobody runs over you from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say, but it's hard to do, because it happens in a
split second. Sometimes you don't see it coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez didn't see it coming last Thursday at Fairplex Park.
</P>
<P>
   And Garza didn't see it coming an hour later when the phone rang
at his Thousand Oaks home. Garza was holding a new grandchild at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   The call was from a racehorse-owner friend wondering if Garza
had heard the news. Two jockeys had gone down in the fifth race.
One would be all right.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Carlos ``J.C.'' Gonzalez _ the ultrapolite 23-year-old
Garza knew as Carlitos _ was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son saw the look on my face and grabbed the baby. I
couldn't believe what I was hearing,'' Garza said a week later at a
table holding pictures of him and Carlitos. ``It was devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had been Garza's first pupil when the 52-year-old
former quarterhorse and thoroughbred rider opened his school for
jockeys at Two Winds Ranch a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's modest success _ top apprentice at Hollywood Park and
leading jockey at Fairplex in 1998 _ had made him Garza's best
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't even know how to ride in a (racing) saddle when he
came to me,'' Garza could boast.
</P>
<P>
   The young man had gotten on horses in his native Mexico, and had
heard about Garza from a family friend, who suggested that with
Gonzalez's size (5-foot-1) and athletic build, he could be a
jockey.
</P>
<P>
   Garza started him out on a docile, ``push-button'' horse. As
Gonzalez improved, he worked his way up to the meanest beast on the
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he showed he could handle that horse, I said, `That's it
_ you're ready for the racetrack,''' Garza recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The one-on-one schooling lasted a few months. Gonzalez would
work with Garza Monday through Friday. Five o'clock Monday morning
he'd be back for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot of guts,'' Garza said. ``And he was a
gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Garza, who takes a handful of students at a time, knows that
most won't last more than a month. They lack the guts, the talent
or the commitment.
</P>
<P>
   One would-be jockey quit the school a few months ago after
watching a horse kick Garza in the leg, breaking it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them the truth up front. This is a very dangerous
sport. You never know when you're going to fall,'' Garza said.
``It's not an easy thing to do. You learn the basics here (at the
school). Then you go to the track and the trainers tell you
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   A young rider must expect to exercise horses for a few months
before a trainer is convinced he can be trusted in a race. Then he
must prove himself by performing well with the 30-1 longshots just
to earn a chance at the 2-1 contenders.
</P>
<P>
   At that, it's easier than in Garza's day, when there were no
jockey schools.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, who grew up near fabled Kings Ranch in Texas, learned to
ride on that state's bush tracks, places with names like Viva
Downs, Life Downs, Dutchman Downs and Lost Valley (now Bandera)
Downs. He rode his first quarterhorse winner the day after his 10th
birthday. The purse was $150.
</P>
<P>
   When Hurricane Beulah shut down racing for months in the late
'60s, Garza moved to California, where he rode at Los Alamitos and
the major Southern California tracks, earning a reputation as a
jockey horses liked to run for.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries curtailed his career. A horse flipped in the Los Al
starting gate and crushed his ankle. Another wrapped him around a
rail in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have one bone broke,'' Garza said of the Texas
accident. ``I should have been dead... I had a lot of falls that
could have killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Garza said he always liked the danger.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it pretty hard,'' Garza said of Gonzalez's death,
attributed to massive head injuries caused by the hooves of the
horses behind him when his mount broke down. ``It hasn't really got
into my brain yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not only one of my students. He was like a member of
my family. It's hard, because I say, `Maybe I'm at fault. Why did I
teach him to ride?' But I know it was a freak accident.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gonzalez was at Del Mar this summer, he would phone and
offer to drive to Newbury Park, to talk to the students and ride
the laid-up horses Garza cares for.
</P>
<P>
   Garza would decline the offer. Tuesdays, he knew, were
Gonzalez's only days off.
</P>
<P>
   But Garza couldn't say no last summer when Gonzalez called to
invite him to the trophy ceremony following the Fairplex riding
title.
</P>
<P>
   Garza has the photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have another J.C. one of these days,'' Garza said.
``Probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath: Gonzalez was buried Thursday in his hometown,
Yahualica, Jalisco, Mexico. He was dressed in the silks of trainer
Rafael Becerra, a family friend. A whip and helmet were placed in
the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   _Local services were held Saturday, Sunday and Monday near
Gonzalez's home in Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   _Fairplex established the J.C. Gonzalez Memorial Jockey Award,
to go to each year's leading thoroughbred rider.
</P>
<P>
   _The track is accepting donations to the J.C. Gonzalez Memorial
Fund (Los Angeles County Fair, P.O. Box 2250, Pomona, 91769).
Proceeds will go to his mother, Maria de los Angeles Gonzalez, a
housekeeper who lives in Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   _The infield flags fly at half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been rough,'' said Iggy Puglisi, who was in tears after
winning last Friday's third race aboard a horse Gonzalez had been
scheduled to ride. ``The day after the accident, it was a bad, bad
scene in the (jockeys') room. Nobody would even say his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every day we're feeling a little more comfortable. J.C.'s
gone, and we can't do anything about that, but he'll never be
forgotten.''

MORE BAD NEWS FOR DALY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ John Daly readily admits he can still get a grip
on a cocktail glass or beer bottle. Sometimes the truth is ugly.
</P>
<P>
   It is just too bad he can't throw his arms around his demons,
which he desperately needs to exorcise.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the game of golf, Daly is making a run at double bogeying
life.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with regret and sadness that Callaway Golf Co. founder
and chairman Ely Callaway this week terminated Daly's endorsement
contract with the club maker.
</P>
<P>
   It was the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway should be applauded for hiring Daly in the first place
and for firing him after he breeched the crystal clear language in
his contract. Tough love can be as hard to give as it is to
receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We care a great deal for John as a person, a golfer and a
friend, and we are grateful for the period of time he successfully
supported the company,'' Callaway said. ``Regrettably, we cannot
continue to have John as a company representative when he is not
prepared to take the future steps that we and our expert advisers
feel are necessary to deal with the alcohol and gambling problems
facing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some tour players found the news distressing.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, a friend on tour, did not want to believe that Daly
had returned to drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not true,'' Lehman told the Associated Press after
the first round of the B.C. Open in Endicott, N.Y. was postponed by
rain from Hurricane Floyd. ``It would be very sad. It's sad enough
that Callaway yanked its sponsorship, although I think they've been
very patient with John. I hope it's not true that he's drinking
again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rumors of the drinking and gambling began filtering back
to Callaway's headquarters in Carlsbad a few weeks ago and Daly was
called in to discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
   He readily admitted the rumors were true. And for this he should
be applauded, too, if in fact he believes that in this case
acknowledging the truth is a step along the road to setting those
demons free.
</P>
<P>
   Daly flew home and posted the following response on his web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``My commitment to live a sober life remains strong. Alcoholism
is a disease which will continue to challenge me the rest of my
life. I accept the difficulties presented and hope that I will
overcome whatever obstacles I face,'' his statement said.
</P>
<P>
   But he should be scolded in the strongest terms for rejecting
Callaway's latest offer of help.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway offered to have his company pay for in-patient
treatment at a facility run by an expert on addictions. Daly had
already gone through an alcohol re-hab program at the Sierra Tucson
Center in 1992 and declined the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Since then trouble and controversy dogged him like a bad case of
the yips, including a parking lot scuffle with a 62-year-old man
after the final round of the 1994 World Series of Golf.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ely Callaway was willing to take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Daly considered him a father figure.
</P>
<P>
   So this week's parting is tough on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very painful and very emotionally draining and very
difficult. But it was something that had to be done as a business
decision,'' said company spokesman Larry Dorman. ``John's contract
was with the company. It wasn't just with Ely. He agonized over
this thing and tried to get John to see that treatment was
something he really needed to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf is the loneliest of sports.
</P>
<P>
   It is pretty much played in silence without teammates to rely
on.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from endorsement deals, there are not guaranteed contracts
on tour.
</P>
<P>
   You make what you earn and your livelihood depends on your
swing.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for someone as troubled as John Daly to find someone
like Ely Callaway who was willing to make an emotional as well as a
financial investment in a career.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to understand that door at Callaway was shut,
not slammed on John Daly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approach we taking is we would never say never,'' Dorman
explained. ``If he were to realize the necessity and importance of
changing his life around and getting treatment... then I'm sure we
would talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also important for Daly to understand he is struggling
with a serious problem, one that is coming close to derailing a
once promising career.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a battle he should fight alone.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway has given him some good advice and an excellent
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Daly should take them both.
</P>

SEATTLE TRANSPLANT CHANG FISHING TO REGAIN TOP RANKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There have been a few Michael Chang sightings since he
moved from Nevada to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did throw out the ball during a Sonics game last year,''
Chang said the other day from his Mercer Island home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played the Knicks. And they did win that game,'' Chang
said, as if hinting that his presence this coming season might help
the Sonics win a few more games.
</P>
<P>
   Chang is ready to root for the home teams, now that he calls
Seattle home.
</P>
<P>
   With Lake Washington as his playground, 27-year-old Chang _ an
avid fisherman _ is on his way to becoming the quintessential
Northwesterner.
</P>
<P>
   He has learned the intricacies of salmon fishing _ how to steer
clear of pesky dogfish that glom onto herring bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd suffer if there wasn't any fishing where I live,'' Chang
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why Seattle is perfect. It is very picturesque. I mean,
getting off a plane and seeing the water and mountains and getting
into the slower pace. It's really nice after all the hustle and
bustle of being on the road and in airports.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Chang's Mercer Island hopping has not included neighbor
Paul Allen's abode.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I haven't been to his house,'' Chang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's about a quarter mile from me, but I have fished off in
front of his dock, although he doesn't know it.''
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon at 5 p.m. at the University of Washington's
Nordstrom Tennis Center, Chang's Seattle coming-out party will get
a big boost.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-year ATP Tour veteran whose ranking hit No. 2 in 1996,
Chang will compete against Jan-Michael Gambill in a fund-raising
exhibition match to benefit the University's Breast Care Program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the singles match, Chang, Gambill _ a Spokane
native with movie-star looks and a two-handed approach from both
sides of the ball _ and two other Seattle-based tennis tour pros,
Jonathan Stark and Patrick Galbraith, will play in a doubles match.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition event comes just two weeks after Chang and
Gambill each lost a second-round match at the 1999 U.S. Open in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill, ranked No. 55 on the ATP Tour, had a tremendous season
in 1998. He soared from No. 227 at the start of the year to No. 38,
becoming the youngest player in the Top 50 ATP Tour rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, meanwhile, hit No. 2 in the world in September 1996, when
he advanced to the final of the U.S. Open. If Chang had beaten
Sampras that day, he would have claimed his first No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Chang refuses any suggestion that his best days are
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I would love to get back into the Top 10,'' he
said. ``I want to be No. 1, and I want to win the three remaining
Grand Slams I haven't won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so close to being No. 1. I wasn't quite able to make it
and, to be quite honest, it does put a little scratch in the back
of my head that maybe I can go a little farther.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sampras, Andre Agassi, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Carlos Moya and
Marcela Rios have staked their claims on top of the ATP rankings,
Chang was crushed by a series of injuries last season. A sore wrist
especially took a toll, throwing off his rhythm and mechanics and
making it tough for one of the tour's most acclaimed,
crowd-pleasing, five-set battlers to outlast so many of the tour's
hard-hitting power players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heading in the right direction,'' Chang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't feel bigger and better things were awaiting me, I
wouldn't be working so hard to improve. I'm a perfectionist. I feel
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   With Agassi's impressive victories at the French and U.S. opens,
Chang has faced the natural question: Is he inspired by Agassi's
rebirth?
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre and I are different. He talked about how he lacked the
commitment to being a top player and how he lost interest in
working hard. He wanted to only go play 10 tournaments,'' Chang
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had that situation. I haven't dropped down for lack
of interest. For me, it was different in that I have continued to
work hard. It's just that the results haven't been very good.''
</P>
<P>
   But the guys stick together, Chang says. He is part of an
American tennis clan that wants to see its members uphold the
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre, Pete (Sampras), Jim Courier, Todd Martin and I all grew
up playing against each other,'' Chang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all helped each other be the tennis players we are. So
when I look at one of them, I say, `If this person can do it, I
know I can do it, since I've beaten that player in the past.' We've
all pushed each other that way.''
</P>
<P>
   As for feeling outmatched by the big guys on tour, Chang refuses
to get overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing it all my life. So that's my approach. I know
that I'm going to have to go out there and run down every shot. I
know I'm going to be facing guys with 130 mph serves. I'm willing
to do that. My style of play is never going to be about power, but
I can use the resources I have. I know I have to battle every time
I go out there. Just about every match it is like David and
Goliath.''
</P>
<P>
   That might even include this evening's exhibition in Chang's
adopted hometown.

RODRIGUEZ ENDS SLUMP, SLAMS DEVIL RAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Thursday afternoon, Mariners manager Lou
Piniella asked his shortstop, Alex Rodriguez, if he wanted the day
off.
</P>
<P>
   By his own estimation, Rodriguez was struggling more than he
ever had, and Piniella thought his young star could benefit from
rest. Rodriguez, however, was in no mood to sit. He had company
coming over to Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `My mom drove a long way from Miami not to watch me
sit on the bench,' '' Rodriguez said, after his eighth-inning grand
slam beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 5-3. ``I told him I'd rather
play today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's skid had reached 5-for-58 (.086) when he stood in
against Devil Rays right-hander Esteban Yan with one out and the
M's trailing, 2-0. Yan put one fastball by him, but his second one
came in high, and Rodriguez pounded it 418 feet over the center
field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitters like that, when they come out of it, they come out of
it in a fierce way _ and he did,'' said Mariners hitting coach
Jesse Barfield. ``And he didn't try to pull it, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The homer was Rodriguez's 38th of the season and pushed him past
the 100-RBI mark, with 103. It was also his third slam of the year,
tying a club record.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitchers also tied records thanks to the home run. Jose Mesa
worked two innings for his 33rd save, matching Mike Schooler's
10-year-old Mariners record, and Freddy Garcia earned his 15th
victory, tying Wilson Alvarez's record for single-season wins by a
Venezuelan pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia (15-8) traded shutout innings with another rookie, Tampa
Bay's Ryan Rupe, through the sixth. Garcia carried a two-hitter
into the seventh, but Terrell Lowery's one-out single scored Paul
Sorrento from second with the game's first run. The Devil Rays
increased their lead to 2-0 on David Lamb's two-out triple.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell led off the Mariners eighth with a single off Rupe,
and one-out walks by Brian Hunter and Jay Buhner set up Rodriguez's
heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt better tonight,'' said Garcia, who allowed 12 hits and
five walks in a loss at Baltimore his last start. ``The last couple
of times, I was losing my location. Tonight, I got my location
back. I threw a lot of fastballs, curveballs and two-seamers, and
first-pitch strikes were very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa entered the game in the eighth, after Tom Davey, who had
discomfort in his forearm this road trip, loaded the bases on a
single, walk and hit batter. Mesa fanned Sorrento, allowed a
sacrifice fly to John Flaherty to trim the lead to 4-3 and walked
Lowery to load the bases again. Fred McGriff, who had missed a week
with tightness in a leg muscle, pinch hit and grounded to first,
ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   A 1-2-3 ninth followed, giving Mesa his 33rd save in 38 chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see him wind up with 40,'' said pitching coach
Stan Williams. ``He's been better lately. He's been ahead of
hitters lately and a lot more relaxed out there. Most of the
trouble he had came early in the season, and he's done a good job
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   When the game was over, Rodriguez tossed a game ball to his
mother, Lourdes Navarro, who was sitting in the front row. He said
he had an enjoyable, if brief, visit with his family, and kept his
recent struggles in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize that things are going to go like that sometimes,''
Rodriguez said. ``That's just the game. I felt like I held up
pretty well through the whole thing and kept working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella said he'll see how Rodriguez feels today, then let him
decide if he wants a rest. Rodriguez was pleased to hear he'd again
have that choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'll play,'' he said. ``That's easy.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Air Force football players gather on an access road
every day before practice. They wait behind a thick blue line.
Inscribed in large white letters is their motto for this season:
``Whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   When the entire team is present, only then do they cross the
line.
</P>
<P>
   College football is full of long-standing traditions. Nearly
every team has a motto; nearly every coach can spout cliches about
toughness and extra effort. Much of it makes people's eyes glaze in
boredom. These are unsentimental times.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Air Force's success during head coach Fisher DeBerry's
15-year tenure rises above a college football landscape littered
with scandal, criminality and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Unheralded athletes enter the Falcons program knowing that they
are committing not only to four years of football but also to five
to eight years of military service. These are not prep
All-Americans who talk about NFL careers before they play a down of
Division I football.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my only opportunity to play Division I football,''
quarterback Cale Bonds said. ``That's the way it is with most of
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, only Tennessee has won more games over the past two
seasons. Air Force is the nation's 19th winningest program in the
1990s and has produced 19 All-Americans under DeBerry's guidance.
Though Notre Dame, Ohio State, BYU, Texas, Virginia Tech and
Washington top recruiting rankings and stock the NFL with talent,
they each have fallen victim to the Falcons' triple-option attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see these huge guys on the other team and we wonder, `What
gives us an advantage?' '' receiver Matt Farmer said. ``It seems a
little weird we can beat those schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The explanations for Air Force's improbable success tread
dangerously close to cliches: The Falcons play as a team; they are
disciplined; they are well-coached; they are well-conditioned. Such
words evoke skepticism. It seems too simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had an answer,'' said DeBerry, whose 121-64-1 record
makes him one of 16 active coaches with more than 100 victories.
``I think success breeds success.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerry, 61, a good ol' boy from Spartanburg, S.C., with an
accent to prove it, says a lot of things that would stop many in
their tracks:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think today's young people are sincere about their education
... The most positive thing about Air Force is the (service)
commitment. A lot of people look at it like a negative. That's one
of the problems with society today ... They (Air Force football
players) have got to be outstanding students. There's no
compromising here.''
</P>
<P>
   Chad Hennings, a defensive lineman with the Dallas Cowboys,
didn't attract much attention coming out of high school. After four
years at Air Force, he became the Academy's most decorated football
player. He was a consensus All-American and won the 1987 Outland
Trophy. He has since been named the WAC Player of the Decade.
</P>
<P>
   As a 6-foot-6, 265-pound senior, he had NFL coaches drooling.
Yet Hennings was committed to military service for eight years
because he had entered the pilot program. Big pay checks would have
to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I won the Outland Trophy, the NFL was never a
consideration,'' Hennings said. ``There were some `what ifs,' but I
wouldn't call it regret. I didn't dwell on it too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Hennings needed a waiver for his height and weight to become a
pilot. He flew the A-10 tankbuster for six months during the
Persian Gulf War in ``Operation Provide Comfort,'' which protected
the beleaguered Kurds from the Iraqi army. That might be a more
impressive distinction than his three Super Bowl rings with the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Not all athletes enter the Academy because they want to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer, a senior, was teased by his friends when he signed with
Air Force as a receiver. They said all he would do is block. Last
year, he became the first Falcon to earn All-WAC honors at his
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any interest in a service academy,'' Farmer said.
``I didn't even know this place existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, Nebraska and New Mexico tried to coax Farmer to walk on.
When his father informed him that he'd have to pay his own way if
he chose those schools, Farmer signed with Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either like it (military life) or you don't _ there's not
much in between,'' he said. ``To be honest, I have no idea what God
has in store for my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Farmer firmly believes in the football program.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have is each other for four years,'' he said. ``The
team bond is different here. It doesn't matter who does what. We
just need to win.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerry's name invariably comes up when a big-time program has a
coaching vacancy. He's been approached by South Carolina, Clemson,
Northwestern, Iowa State, Auburn and Colorado. Though he said he
would ``never say never,'' with most of his family near Colorado
Springs, he appears to be established at the Falcon helm for the
long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Hennings recalled the 1984 Independence Bowl, DeBerry's first
season, when Air Force was an underdog to Virginia Tech and future
Hall of Famer Bruce Smith. That game foreshadowed things to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Smith) didn't do anything because guys were biting at his
ankles,'' Hennings said. ``It wasn't his style of play.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICKLY: University of Colorado returned 350 tickets for next
week's game at Husky Stadium. The tickets, located in the west end
zone, will go on sale today at the Husky ticket office
(206-543-2200) or Ticketmaster (206-628-0888). ... UW head coach
Rick Neuheisel said Willie Hurst will start at tailback again, with
Braxton Cleman and Paul Arnold coming off the bench. ... Reserve
defensive lineman Joe Collier sprained his knee during practice
Wednesday and will be out for four to six weeks.

JOHNSON OPENS WITH FIRST-ROUND RECORD 64 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENT, Wash. _ After filing missing persons reports for the
better part of a week, the 18th Safeco Classic got started
Thursday. The only thing that didn't show were Michelle McGann's
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   One trip around Meridian Valley Country Club proved that the
Safeco Classic can be a resilient host, with a familiar face moving
atop the leader board in record fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-year tour veteran Chris Johnson carded an eight-under-par
64 _ one better than the tourney's previous first-round low _ and
grabbed a two-stroke edge over little-known Australian Wendy
Doolan. Four players were three shots back, including McGann using
borrowed equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice when everything comes around and it works
out,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   For a tourney lacking in headliners, Johnson gracefully moved to
the forefront with a bogey-free round. She birdied seven of the
last 10 holes she played. She dropped four putts from 30 feet or
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Only four players in the 143-player field have more LPGA
victories than Johnson, a nine-time winner. And only one of them,
Annika Sorenstam, still has the game to do it again. Sorenstam shot
a first-round 71, leaving her plenty of ground to make up.
</P>
<P>
   Se Ri Pak, Korea's answer to Tiger Woods, shot 69, keeping her
well within range.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the tour's big names bypassing Safeco, the field
has 88 players seeking their first LPGA victory. That includes
Scotland's Catriona Matthew, one of five players at 67. She sees
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously when some of the top players aren't here, you don't
have to beat them,'' Matthew said. ``You have more of a chance. But
you still have to play well to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has flourished before in the Safeco Classic, but not
gone the distance. In 1989, she was the first-round co-leader with
a six-under 66. In 1994, she led the field with two holes to go
before finishing a stroke behind eventual winner Deb Richard.
</P>
<P>
   While others have been assailed for skipping this week's event,
a Johnson absence would have been excused.
</P>
<P>
   The Tucson, Ariz., resident is playing in just her fourth LPGA
event since a July tragedy involving her estranged husband. Her
spouse, Bill Shearman, allegedly killed an attorney and wounded the
man's wife before taking his own life during a police pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   The golfer stepped lightly around her personal life Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been a difficult year,'' Johnson said. ``I have good
memories. It's good to be playing. It beats the alternative of
being at home.''
</P>
<P>
   McGann found herself at Meridian Valley Thursday, ready for an
8:40 tee time after traveling the day before from a Scottish golf
outing that involved Gary Player and Bernhard Langer.
Unfortunately, her clubs were still in London. British Airways had
misplaced her bag.
</P>
<P>
   She did what any golfer does when in trouble. She scrambled.
</P>
<P>
   McGann borrowed a set of irons from the club assistant pro. She
used a driver on loan from fellow tour player Dina Ammaccapane. She
got a 5-wood from the LPGA club repair trailer. She picked out a
3-wood, putter, shoes and socks in the pro shop.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone doubted that this Safeco Classic is a patchwork job,
McGann confirmed it.
</P>
<P>
   Using her hastily assembled equipment, she birdied six of her
first eight holes, then parred the final eight. McGann said the
borrowed irons felt heavier than her own. To be safe, she clubbed
up on shots. It worked.
</P>
<P>
   McGann should have her own sticks back today, but she'll keep
the replacement putter for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good about getting it around,'' she said of her
round. ``I wasn't sure how I would feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Missing clubs are only a temporary ordeal. Far more serious,
McGann, a diabetic, wears an insulin pump while playing during each
tournament. She has done this for 18 months, about the same time
she stopped adding to her seven tour victories.
</P>
<P>
   She loses energy, then strokes, or worse. Two weeks ago in
Springfield, Ill., McGann had to be taken to a hospital emergency
room after her pump became detached during competition without her
knowing it and she became ill. She wasn't released until 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Diet is crucial to her golf game. She has to read her body's
needs as well as putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is hard enough,'' she said. ``You lose your focus
while you're out there if you're hungry. It's been a
trial-and-error process.''
</P>
<P>
   At Safeco, there is no shortage of resilience.

FEDERAL PROSECUTORS JOIN PROBE OF CORRUPTION IN LAPD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV, LISA VAN PROYEN AND PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Federal prosecutors entered the LAPD corruption
probe Thursday as a 22-year-old illegal immigrant was released from
prison and flown back to Los Angeles three years after two Rampart
Division officers allegedly framed him in a shooting that left him
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Alejandro N. Mayorkas said his office would
determine whether there were violations of the civil rights of
Javier Ovando, who was convicted of assault based on testimony of
Officers Rafael Perez and Nino Durden.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, facing cocaine charges, admitted planting a gun on Ovando
after Durden, his partner, wounded the Honduran immigrant. Durden
has been placed on paid leave and is under investigation for his
role in the shooting, said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for District
Attorney Gil Garcetti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will work with Chief Bernard Parks and the LAPD to
determine all the facts surrounding this matter,'' Mayorkas said.
``What we know so far has raised allegations of a man being
improperly convicted and serving time in prison. We want to
determine what happened and look into other allegations that have
been raised.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal probe came a day after Parks announced a department
investigation into corruption and the suspension of 11 current and
former Rampart Division officers.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the department investigation also was triggered by
revelations Perez made during plea agreement discussions on charges
he stole six pounds of cocaine, worth $800,000, from an evidence
locker at Parker Center.
</P>
<P>
   Perez has pleaded guilty to four counts of grand theft and
possession of cocaine for sale. He is scheduled to be sentenced
Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Larry Paul Fidler's decision to release Ovando came after
Deputy District Attorney Richard A. Rosenthal filed a petition for
a writ of habeas corpus Thursday seeking his unconditional release.
Perez said he and Durden ``overreacted and shot an unarmed man and
subsequently planted a gun on the shooting victim,'' according to
the petition.
</P>
<P>
   Ovando, father of a 2-year-old daughter, was released from the
maximum-security Salinas Valley State Prison near Soledad late
Thursday afternoon. He arrived at Van Nuys Airport around 8:25 p.m.
in a twin-engine plane.
</P>
<P>
   He faces deportation, but he agreed to leave with detectives
from the LAPD's Internal Affairs unit, who consider him a key
witness in the corruption probe. His cooperation could allow him to
stay here indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Perez in his plea agreement was granted immunity from
prosecution in the Ovando case.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he told us in his statement is protected by the plea
agreement, but if we come up with independent evidence that was not
discussed in his confession, that would open him up to
prosecution,'' Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Public Defender Tamara R. Toister, who defended Ovando in
1997, said she learned of the break in the case only this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said he didn't have a gun. He maintained during his
trial that he didn't own one and wouldn't know how to get one,''
Toister said.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry into a dozen Los Angeles police officers, including
one supervisor, who had been stationed at the Rampart Division sent
shock waves through the department and the city as Parks sought to
restore the department's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credibility is all we have,'' Parks said. ``When we knock on a
door, people expect to be treated with respect and dignity. That is
the only legacy we leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The department refused to release the list of officers who have
been placed on paid leave. The Police Protective League has
assigned attorneys to consult with the suspended officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the department investigates this properly, and I know they
will, I know that they're going to find that my client didn't do
anything. He'll be right back to work,'' said attorney Barry Levin,
who works for the Command Officers Association and represents the
sergeant who has been relieved of duty.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUES ON 2ND TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing (the investigation) in a very tough, impartial
way,'' Riordan said. ``He wants the truth, and he's not going to
tolerate bad apples. . . . There will be no cover-up. The facts
will come out, and the officers will be disciplined if they need to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation at the Rampart Division began last year after
Perez's arrest for stealing the cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Parks ordered major staffing changes at the Rampart Division and
replaced officers suspected of either being involved criminally or
in following a ``code of silence'' in not informing on other
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The department also instituted tougher procedures in having
officers get evidence, requiring them to show identification cards
that are photocopied with detailed information on court cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a situation that anyone in a uniform could get
evidence,'' one source said. ``Then, no one really checked it when
it was returned. There were some cases where drugs were taken out,
phony drugs replaced, and then an order was given to destroy it. No
one really knows what happened to the drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Police Commission President Edith Perez said she insisted
that more controls be put into place following the arrest of Rafael
Perez, who is not related to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, they thought it was just a handful of officers,''
she said. ``My experience was to multiply it by three, and that's
what you would have involved. It was the type of thing where the
investigation kept getting larger and larger.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said the District Attorney's Office's Special
Investigation Division is working with the LAPD on the inquiry and
is expected to look at other cases involving the officers.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney James Hahn has assigned one of his top attorneys
to work with the LAPD to review other prosecutions involving Perez
and others implicated in the case to see whether there are problems
with other cases.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said the inquiry will continue to focus on the
dozen officers but will not be limited to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will go all the way up,'' one official said. ``Obviously,
there was a problem somewhere, and it could involve some
top-ranking department officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Richard Meraz, who was the captain of patrol and
detectives at the Rampart Division during the Perez investigation,
said he was sickened to learn of the number of officers involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a big knot in my stomach . . . My reaction was sad,
hurt, disillusioned and angry. I don't know whether to cry or throw
up,'' said Meraz, now Central Division commanding officer for
detectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's affected the whole department. It's definitely had an
impact on me, and I'm second-guessing myself and what I did right
and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Bert Boeckmann said he expected Parks to
provide a full briefing to the commission, possibly as early as
today when it meets in Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is a situation just at Rampart,''
Boeckmann said. ``What's hard, when you have a department of nearly
10,000 people, you're going to find yourselves with a dozen or so
bad apples. I hope people realize what a small number this is and
how wonderfully clean the department has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwomen Jackie Goldberg voiced similar thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our officers do a wonderful job,'' said Goldberg, in
whose district the Rampart Division is located. ``I wouldn't want
to see that overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how good your department is, you need a strong
independent voice,'' Goldberg said. ``That's what the people voted
for.''

DOMAIN NAMES DON'T FETCH PRICE
</HEADLINE>

JASON Z. COHEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sterling Clark is hoping her ticket to a music
career leads through the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old wants to finance her college education with the
proceeds of the sale of an especially presidential Internet domain
name. Just $150,000 will buy www.president-of-the-usa.com from
Clark; another $30,000 gets www.president-usa.net.
</P>
<P>
   Clark stumbled across the domain names while working her
part-time job at Force Five Entertainment, a production company.
She quickly registered for ownership of the sites and almost as
quickly put them up for sale on eBay.com, the online auction Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I'm asking a steep price because it's not like
I'm going to spend it on junk,'' said Clark, who hopes the proceeds
will pay for music classes at USC.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Sterling is getting a real-world education in
business. With the auction set to expire just after 5 p.m.
Saturday, there were no bids as of Thursday for the names, which at
least one industry expert said isn't too surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tinsley, chief executive of domain-name broker Great
Domains, said Sterling is asking too much for her domain names. He
should know; his company has more than 87,000 domain names
available, and recently sold drugs.com for more than $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Great Domains has a valuation guideline posted on its Web site
that gives domain-name owners an indication of the value of the
name they own. According to the Great Domains model, Sterling's
domain name is worth between $1,000 and $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough for four years at USC, but certainly a good start.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley said hyphens in the name and a length of more than just
a few characters diminishes the value of a domain name.
</P>
<P>
   ``She shouldn't feel discouraged at all. The auction model for a
domain name just doesn't work. Unless it's something special or you
do a lot of media work, it doesn't happen,'' Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling has tried to market the sites. She's contacted
representatives of the current resident of the White House, as well
as officials with the national Democratic, Republican and Reform
parties. So far, all she's gotten back is a form e-mail thanking
her for her correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sterling is confident. Although she hasn't received any
bids, she said she did receive an e-mail from someone she wouldn't
identify who offered $30,000 for the domain name if it doesn't sell
on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   That's still a pretty good return on a $70 investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised they weren't taken because that's a
really valuable name,'' Sterling said. ``I totally freaked, because
I thought they'd be taken, but they weren't.''

CHAIN PUTTING LOCAL THEATERS ON BLOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- So long, L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts-based General Cinemas, citing its strategy of
focusing on the Northeast and Midwest, said Thursday it is actively
trying to sell its six Los Angeles-area GCC theaters.
</P>
<P>
   And in a cost-savings move, the chain will also close its
regional office in Woodland Hills by the end of the year and either
transfer or offer retirement packages to the dozen employees.
</P>
<P>
   The moves reflect the declining popularity of any theaters but
the newest megaplex sites. GCC facilities on the block include the
seven-screen GCC in Sherman Oaks, the five-screen Glendale Central,
the Fallbrook Mall 10 in Woodland Hills, the three-screen Avco in
Westwood, the six-screen Hollywood Galaxy and the six-screen
Beverly Connection in West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been strong interest, and we've been in discussions
with potential buyers, although we haven't finalized anything,''
spokesman Brian Callahan said. ``The locations continue to be
popular among moviegoers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some locations are in areas with strong customer
traffic, they all opened before the arrival of the tiered stadium
seating now favored by many moviegoers. The Woodland Hills and
Sherman Oaks theaters have seen five state-of-the-art theaters with
68 screens open nearby within the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Declining box office has led to the closure this summer of the
Americana 5 in Panorama City and the six-screen UA Warner Center in
Woodland Hills. Pacific may shutter its three-screen Topanga in
Woodland Hills soon, executives said last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is a very competitive marketplace for exhibitors
with only multiplexes rather than megaplexes,'' said entertainment
analyst Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research Partners. ``You have to
manage your brand very carefully to make a good impression on
moviegoers. The quality of megaplexes is climbing so quickly that
existing plants and equipment are aging rapidly.''

<P>
   General Cinemas, which operates 140 theaters with 1,067 screens,
will also close its regional office in Chicago to cut costs. The
publicly traded theater chain reported a 63 percent profit decline
to $1.9 million for its third quarter ended July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan did not disclose the asking price for the Los Angeles
sites, most of which are on leased property. The 60-site Mann
chain, which includes the legendary Chinese Theatre in Hollywood
and the landmark Village in Westwood, has been on the block since
January, with reports emerging that owner Warburg Pincus will have
to accept less than the $165 million it paid in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Skislock noted the prices for the Mann and General Cinema
properties will likely be held down by the fact that the sites have
few alternative uses and that there is little incentive to
refurbish the theaters. ``Consumers know the difference between a
new theater and a rebuilt one,'' he added.

BLAKE TO BE SIDELINED UP TO FOUR WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Jason Blake, the wait continues.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota native arrived at the Los Angeles Kings' training
camp less than two weeks ago as one of the team's hottest
additions, a 26-year-old rookie with speed, fearlessness, and a
three-year, $1.85-million contract.
</P>
<P>
   But Blake injured his right knee in the first week of camp,
missed the Kings' first two preseason games, and learned Thursday
that he will require surgery to repair torn cartilage. A Kings
spokesman said Blake will be sidelined up to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Blake had been scheduled to play tonight at the Pond against the
Anaheim Mighty Ducks, on a line with Pavel Rosa and Justin
Papineau.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he and the Kings will have to wait awhile longer to see
what the former North Dakota star can contribute at the NHL level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be here,'' Blake said recently when asked to assess
his chances of making the team. ``I'll do anything I have to do to
play at this level. Obviously, there are experienced guys here. I'm
just as new at this as the next guy. But they expect me to play my
game, and if I do that, I'll stay up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Blake and the Kings, the injury so far is
denying him his chance.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's promise was one of the things that sustained the Kings
through the long off-season. At the end of the dreary 1998-99
season, he appeared in his first NHL game and was the best player
on the ice for either team, scoring a goal in a loss by the Kings
to the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the danger to his frame - generously listed at
5-foot-10, 180 pounds - Blake was fearless, repeatedly venturing
into traffic and going to the net to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who is not related to Kings captain Rob Blake, said the
one game he appeared in helped him immensely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing that helped me was being in that one game,''
Blake said. ``It's probably not a big deal, but for me it was. I
got to meet the guys, eat with them. I'm in awe, but I'm here to
earn a spot on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   His odds, however, just grew a bit steeper.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's game: The Mighty Ducks are expected to play most of
their regulars tonight, with the notable exception of Paul Kariya,
who remains sidelined with a hip injury. The Ducks also are without
defenseman Kevin Haller, who is recuperating from recent
arthroscopic surgery to his right knee. Haller is expected back for
the start of the season, Oct. 2 in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are not expected to use their top line of Jozef
Stumpel, Ziggy Palffy and Luc Robitaille, and Rob Blake also is not
scheduled to play.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first NHL appearance of any kind for Papineau,
a 19-year-old center who scored 52 goals last season in the Ontario
junior league.
</P>
<P>
   Last dance: The Kings and Ducks meet again Monday in what is
scheduled to be the Kings' final game at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, a celebrity game will be played for the benefit
of the Spine In Sports Foundation. Confirmed participants include
the cast of the soon-to-be-released hockey movie ``Mystery,
Alaska,'' and actor Cuba Gooding Jr.

RAY HAS NO ANSWERS TO IRL'S LIMITED FAN BASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG PADILLA  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It seems that no matter how fast Greg Ray goes,
the same questions keep following him around.
</P>
<P>
   The Indy Racing League's points leader has reeled off an
impressive string of results, successes enough to rival that of
CART super-rookie Juan Montoya. Ray has three victories in the last
four IRL events and could wrap up the points title next weekend at
the Vegas.com 500 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the time of his racing life _ if only people would
stop asking about the IRL's limited fan base and its attendance
struggles outside of Indianapolis and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we've been asked the same question for three
years in a row,'' Ray said. ``I don't know what the factors are as
to why it's not successful in some areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, IRL attendance woes aren't Ray's fault.
</P>
<P>
   The Team Menard driver's three victories are most on the circuit
this season. He has held the lead in six races (tied for series
high with Sam Schmidt), has the most laps led at 408 and has won
the most pole positions (three).
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing finish at the Indianapolis 500 in May, Ray
finished second at Texas, won at Pikes Peak in Colorado, finished
23rd at Atlanta because of electrical problems and won the series'
last two races _ at Dover, Del. and back at Pikes Peak.
</P>
<P>
   It is an impressive showing for the driver trying to fill the
shoes of former Menard star Tony Stewart, who is having a
successful rookie season on the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Ray would rather see that impressive showing become the catalyst
for luring prospective race fans to the track. Failing that, he at
least would like questions about poor ticket sales directed toward
the IRL's marketing staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a better promoter, or filling the grandstands and things
like that are business-related,'' Ray said. ``I know that I drive a
race car because I love racing. If I was in the business of putting
people in the seats, I think that would be a fair question. Yet the
drivers get asked that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of picked this up from (Indy 500 winner) Kenny Brack
.4.4. Kenny Brack said it's not our job to sell tickets. The event
itself should sell tickets. Our job is to drive the race car, stay
in good shape, stay focused, set the car up properly.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt the IRL has some of the most competitive
events in racing. The reason for poor attendance is obvious to Ray;
journalists consider the IRL to be CART's poor relative in the
open-wheel racing family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who won the Michigan CART race? Tony Kanaan. Well, I can
guarantee you that the press didn't ask Tony Kanaan why there's
38,000 people in the stands when he won the Michigan 500.'' Ray
said. ``They didn't ask that question. Everything is very skewed,
and it's like the press is following the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid to step out of line. Well, I'm here to tell
you we have some great racing going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Next weekend, fans in Las Vegas get a chance to see what Ray is
talking about, but how many actually show up is anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   A Las Vegas Motor Speedway representative was vague at best,
saying that plenty of good tickets remain and declining to estimate
the number of tickets sold.
</P>
<P>
   Racing will go on, regardless, and Ray has no plans to back off.
Not with a 44-point lead over Scott Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like talking about it because, in some ways, you don't
want to jinx it,'' Ray said. ``But anytime in my life that I've
tried to back up and be conservative, it seems that those are the
times that things happen. I've always been a pretty aggressive
driver in the race car.''
</P>
<P>
   He had no luck early in the season, finishing 21st in each of
the first three races. A gearbox problem knocked him out of the
season-opening event at Orlando and accidents ended his day early
at both Phoenix and Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   It was his disappointing result at Indianapolis that had the
most effect on him, though. Ray had the fastest car in every
qualifying session except for pole qualifying, when he was second
to Arie Luyendyk. An accident in the pits knocked Ray out of the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg is a good driver, and if you look at that team they have
been a front-runner for the last three seasons,'' said fellow
driver Jeff Ward, who finished second to Brack at Indy. ``They have
the motor program, they have the money, the wind-tunnel
development. There is no surprise that Menard has a front-row car
everywhere they go.''
</P>
<P>
   The team is taken seriously. Ray figures the IRL should be, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said wait and see,'' Ray said. ``Well, what are they
waiting to see? We have great racing.''

WHERE DOES THIS FIGHT RATE?
</HEADLINE>
 - COLUMN-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ They've been hyping Saturday evening's debate
between Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad as the biggest
non-heavyweight match in the history of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   And financially, with vast improvement in cable pay-per-view
access, with now more than 40 million homes in the U.S., Canada and
Mexico able to get it, this fight certainly might top the record
800,000 buys generated by the De La Hoya-Pernell Whitaker
engagement.
</P>
<P>
   But as an event that transcends boxing, that inspires the
passions of both its purists and those who seldom pay attention to
the sport, it doesn't come close to ranking with that first
dramatic meeting between Roberto Duran and Sugar Ray Leonard in
Montreal on June 20, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   And, please, don't even mention it with that epic collision
between Leonard and Thomas (The Hitman) Hearns on Sept. 16, 1981 at
Caesars Palace.
</P>
<P>
   And, as for being comparable to that Leonard-Marvin Hagler bit
of high drama on April 6, 1987, forget about it!
</P>
<P>
   The De La Hoya-Trinidad fight is closer to the Nov. 12, 1982
exercise between Alexis Arguello and Aaron Pryor, a
much-anticipated showdown in Miami between two talented fighters
with imposing records.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya and Trinidad also are talented fighters with imposing
records, but lingering doubts still hover over both men.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unprecedented marketing that's been done on De La
Hoya's behalf by Bob Arum's Top Rank organization, the bottom line
with De La Hoya is that he's been artfully matched against an array
of willing foils and that his two biggest victories against
Whitaker and Ike Quartey were shrouded in controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The list of opponents that Trinidad has beaten is even less
impressive than De La Hoya's, and he never before has participated
in a fight in which he wasn't expected to emerge with a one-sided
victory.
</P>
<P>
   When Leonard and Duran had their showdown, Duran had been the
lightweight champion for eight years and Leonard had captured the
welterweight title by dethroning Wilfredo Benitez, a wily, fast
Puerto Rican who would have beaten both Whitaker and Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   Duran already was a legendary figure, while Leonard already was
being compared to Sugar Ray Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Neither De La Hoya nor Trinidad is being compared to Sugar Ray
Robinson. And neither has exactly reached legendary status.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Leonard and Hearns waged combat, both men were well
established commodities with big reputations. Leonard already had
forced Duran into his No Mas surrender, while Hearns had won the
WBA welterweight title with a frightening knockout of Pipino
Cuevas.
</P>
<P>
   Neither De La Hoya nor Trinidad has fought anyone who faintly
resembles Duran and neither man has knocked out anyone the caliber
of Pipino Cuevas.
</P>
<P>
   What made the Leonard-Hagler affair so unique was that it marked
the return of Leonard to the ring after a five-year layoff because
of a serious eye injury.
</P>
<P>
   The story line on that one was right out of Hollywood the fabled
former welterweight champion stepping up a division and making a
comeback against a fearsome middleweight champion who seemed
invincible.
</P>
<P>
   Neither De La Hoya nor Trinidad is attempting a comeback and
neither has been around long enough to earn the respect among
fistic aficionados that Marvin Hagler had when he faced Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   This is not meant to diminish the stature of De La
Hoya-Trinidad, which is the biggest non-heavyweight fight since
Leonard and Hagler settled their differences 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's just to give a sense of proportion to the carnival barker
hoopla surrounding a fight that will make so much money that two
men who despise each other, Bob Arum and Don King, reluctantly
agreed to co-promote it.
</P>
<P>
   Arum thinks there will be more than 1 million pay-per-view buys
for this fight and that it will gross more than $50 million, which
would be a record.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is guaranteed of earning $15 million, but Arum says
De La Hoya's contractual tie-in with pay-per-view revenue will make
his wages even higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Oscar could make as much as $25 million for this
fight,'' says Arum. ``At the very least, he will make $21
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad signed for $10.5 million, with Don King pocketing $2
million of it himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta have my cut,'' says King.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone involved in this fight is becoming wealthier.
</P>
<P>
   But, as an attraction, it simply hasn't generated the consuming
public fascination that those memorable fights that Sugar Ray
Leonard had with Duran, Hearns and Hagler did. . .
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are so scarce for De La Hoya-Trinidad the Mandalay Bay
Events Center has only 12,000 seats that Bob Arum is claiming even
he's had to turn to the brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've bought a few tickets from the scalpers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The brokers are charging anywhere from $1,200 for the cheapest
tickets which are $300 up to $7,000 for prime ringsides that go for
$1,500 at face. ...
</P>
<P>
   As he did in the Quartey and Whitaker fights, De La Hoya once
again figures to have the home court edge in the scoring if it goes
the distance. I don't know about two of the judges, Glen Hamada of
Washington and Bob Logist of Belgium. But I swear that the other
one, Las Vegas' Jerry Roth, has been involved in almost every
controversial decision in this town in recent years and there have
been plenty of them. ...
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum isn't willing to accept Don King's $1 million bet on
Trinidad, but the Hilton's sports book director, Art Manteris, told
me he'd gladly take it.
</P>
<P>
   And King related he's leaning to making the wager with a casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather do it with Arum,'' said King. ``But, obviously, he
doesn't have a lot of confidence in De La Hoya.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Angelo Dundee, the old fight trainer for Sugar Ray Leonard and
Muhammad Ali, is picking Felix Trinidad. ``Trindad is too strong
and hits too hard for De La Hoya,'' said Dundee, who happens to be
one of my favorites in the boxing fraternity and also happens to be
one of its worse forecasters. ...
</P>
<P>
   This growing town desperately needs a rapid transit system. The
traffic congestion on Las Vegas Blvd. and other major thoroughfares
is stifling. ...
</P>
<P>
   Famous gambling figure Jimmy Vaccaro tells me the wise guys are
not taking Don King's cue. ``The fight is such a tossup that a lot
of the people I know simply don't know which way to go, so they're
passing on it,'' he says. ...
</P>
<P>
   They say the new Paris Hotel with its fake Eiffel Tower and
other French accouterments is supposed to make you actually feel as
though you're in Paris. It doesn't. No Louvre, Musee D'Orsay,
Marmottan, or L'Orangerie. ...
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Ray Leonard would have frustrated both Oscar De La Hoya
and Felix Trinidad with his superior speed and athletic skills.
Thomas Hearns would have knocked both out with his terrifying right
hand. Roberto Duran simply would have been too tough and too slick
for both of them.

 BRADLEY, GORE CONDEMN STATE MARRIAGE INITIATIVE  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The issue of same-sex marriage took center stage
in the 2000 presidential race here Thursday, as Democratic hopeful
Bill Bradley became the first to condemn the controversial Knight
Initiative and Vice President Al Gore followed with his own
statement against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's opposition to the controversial initiative came as he
began a two-day swing through California to tout the official
endorsement of Governor Gray Davis and to address three key state
issues _ education, high technology and Hispanic support.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in an interview published Thursday by the Advocate, a
national gay and lesbian magazine, spoke strongly of his opposition
to the amendment on the March 2000 ballot, which would legally
define marriage as between one man and one woman.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley called it ``divisive,'' saying ``it has the potential to
contribute to an atmosphere of hate,'' although he said that he
still opposes same-sex marriage ``because of the religious nature
of marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gore scheduled to arrive in San Francisco Friday, gay
activists began calling for him to follow Bradley's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley is the first to take a stand on the Knight
Initiative. His condemnation is critical for others to emulate,''
said Jason Riggs, spokesman for the Washington-based National Gay
and Lesbian Task Force, yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's office quickly responded that he has valued
the support of gays and lesbians and had planned to illustrate that
support by appearing Friday at San Francisco City Hall to praise
next month's official opening of the city's new gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transgender community center.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gore) has said that, if he lived in California, he would
condemn this divisive initiative,'' said Gore press secretary Kikki
Moore late Thursday, adding that ``although personally, he opposes
same-sex marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore _ the first major presidential candidate to grant an
interview to the Advocate _ wasn't quite as outspoken last month,
saying he would have to ``educate myself'' more on the Knight
Initiative before taking a postion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit to San Francisco ``is certainly very indicative of
his support of our community,'' said San Francisco Supervisor Mark
Leno, one of three supervisors. ``I have no doubt of the vice
president's feelings on this issue. He's made it clear on many of
the things he's said.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno said he welcomed Gore's condemnation of what he called a
``very mean-spirited initiative that is an attack on all minority
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of same-sex marriage could continue to be a volatile
one in the 2000 presidential race, for both Republicans and
Democrats. GOP front-runner George W. Bush, who returns to
California later this month, was asked about his position on the
matter during his March trip to the state. He said he would take no
positions on statewide initiatives but opposed same-sex marriage in
principle.
</P>
<P>
   The California GOP will hold its statewide convention in Anaheim
next week and will hear from candidates Steve Forbes and Elizabeth
Dole, who have not yet directly addressed the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's 59th trip to California had originally begun with a focus
on issues of high technology. In San Diego, Gore held a meeting
among San Diego State University students, police and campus
officials to explore the issue of cyberstalking, which he called
``a very serious new problem confronting us in the information
age.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president cited a new Justice Department report that
called cyberstalking _ defined as using the Internet, e-mail or
other electronic means for stalking purposes _ a disturbing law
enforcement threat on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting tougher sentences is part of the whole education
process, so everybody takes this crime as seriously as it should be
taken,'' said Gore, after hearing from victims of cyberstalkers
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Southern California campaign swing included an address in
San Diego to the 1,500 member U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce _
giving a nod to Latino voters, who are expected to critically
influence the 2000 presidential election in California.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, he plans to visit a public high school in Santa Monica
and to travel at the side of Davis, who is expected to formally
endorse him. After a stop in Fresno, Gore will attend the S.F. City
Hall event, then plans to meet with the International Union of
Bricklayers before heading off to a $1,000-a-head fund-raiser for a
largely high-tech crowd in Los Altos.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's effort in California has appeared to be stuck in low gear
lately, but some political insiders said it will be revved up by
Davis' endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray Davis will help him with fund raising. It will open the
golden Rolodex,'' said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. ``It
will help him with Hollywood and with labor. Gray is plugged in.''
</P>
<P>
   But others suggested that the Davis endorsement could actually
hurt Gore with some Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest variable in discussing whether Bush can beat Gore
is the Latino vote,'' said Bob Gnaizda, of the San Francisco-based
Greenlining Institute. ``Many (Latino) leaders are fearful that
(Gore's connection to) Davis will shift the election to Bush''
because of his perceived ``mistakes on 187 and the aggressive
anti-affirmative action positions.''

 ROYAL UNDIES, IMPERIAL SNAKEBITES  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Here we are at Macy's Passport, the Super Bowl of
fashion shows, hanging with Nick (Joe Boxer) Graham, the Sultan of
Skivvies, discussing the Queen of England's underwear.
<P>
   Passport is where the beautiful people dressed to the teeth go
to watch the even-more-beautiful people undressed to the teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Many fashions are modeled, but the underwear finale, judging by
crowd reaction, is the highlight. And last night, that was Joe's
show _ ``A History of Underwear,'' which is where the Queen comes
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's respectful,'' Nick said of the queen's wardrobe in the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``No bunnage?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nick hedged.
</P>
<P>
   In the show, he showed us underwear through the ages, then a
glimpse of the future _ undershorts that glow in the dark,
undershorts with a built-in laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Bring it on. I'm tired of sticking the laptop on with Scotch
tape.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD MORNING, fellow snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Brown did a 20-minute stand-up routine at a VIP
fund-raiser in D.C., trying out new material. He said, ``In
Mineola, you only get bitten by one snake. In San Francisco, there
are 780,000 of them that bite you.''
</P>
<P>
   We're hissing, Willie, but only because we can't applaud.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure da King Snake meant his reptilian comment in the most
flattering way. He should have mentioned that by the time the FBI
gets done, we might have fewer snakes slithering around town.
</P>
<P>
   ASPHALT JUNGLE: I'm at Fifth and Mission the other afternoon and
I hear a loud crunch, like a bus running over a motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 yards away, a man is sprawled in the middle of the
street near the back wheels of a bus that is pulling away from the
curb.
</P>
<P>
   The man staggers to his feet and lurches to the curb. He tells
me a car cut him off, forced him to swerve, and he fell partway
under a SamTrans bus, which ran over his motorcycle and his right
arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one of 'em (car or bus) stopped,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Man, what a close call! Clumsy cyclist nearly throws bus off
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S WITH the recent crime wave? Among items stolen: Ancient
church bells, barber pole, potted palms from an SPCA event.
</P>
<P>
   Dwayne Newton, an S.F. firefighter who shoulda been a detective,
has a theory: ``It's got to be some yuppie, furnishing his hip
loft.''
</P>
<P>
   THE P.B.&AMP;J. POSSE: Folks check in with reactions to Thursday's
column about S.F. cops chasing away Marin high school kids who hand
out sandwiches to homeless folks every Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see why the SFPD had to stop it,'' says Rich McIntosh.
``That teenage gang is distributing an addictive substance (food).
My God, if you feed a homeless man, he might get a job, buy a car
and start running red lights!''
</P>
<P>
   Art Seaman and Marty Brennels both hope that if the kids get
arrested and convicted, they get sentenced to community service,
like passing out sandwiches to the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice that those students have a social conscience,
considering that they're from Ross, where, Jerry Matters says,
``You dial 911 and you get a caterer.''
</P>
<P>
   Last word from Joe Wiese: ``If sandwiches are outlawed, only
outlaws will have sandwiches.''
</P>
<P>
   SUSPECTS INCLUDE anyone with shoes:
</P>
<P>
   The FBI recently sought public tips that might help capture a
man and woman involved in a Bay Area bank-robbery spree. Jack Green
read about it and was struck by: ``Authorities said (the male
robber) generally enters a bank on foot ...''
</P>
<P>
   So how else is he going to enter the bank?
</P>
<P>
   I WOULDN'T want to be on the East Coast right now. But it sure
would be inspiring to be in New York and watch 5 million people
give a hurricane the finger.

</P>

   &LR; k,1,18  &LR; Scientists speculate &QL; 
gravity may give rise &QL; 
to tides 100 feet high
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; By David Perlman

<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Chronicle Science Editor
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  wrapper  &LR; Scientists analyzing mysterious chains of curving cracks
in the frozen surface of Jupiter's moon Europa have concluded that
they represent the most convincing evidence yet that a deep ocean
covers the entire globe beneath its thick icy crust.
</P>
<P>
   And because Europa's ocean may well be warmed by powerful tidal
activity _ or perhaps even by radioactive heat from the Jovian
moon's deep rocky interior _ Europa could be a prime candidate for
seeking traces of life, the scientists speculate.
</P>
<P>
   Images of Europa's surface, transmitted to Earth from the
Voyager spacecraft that flew in  &LR; orbited around  &LR; Jupiter nearly 20
years ago, first showed the mysterious  &LR; distinctive surface
markings known as cycloids. But because they resemble nothing else
in the solar system, they have remained a mystery until now.
</P>
<P>
   But  &LR; New images from the Galileo spacecraft, flying on a mission
to survey Jupiter and its many moons since 1995, appear to have
solved the puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   In a report published today in the journal Science, Gregory V.
Hoppa and his colleagues at the University of Arizona's Lunar and
Planetary Laboratory show how the arc-shaped cycloidal cracks _
each more than 60 miles long and often linked in chains for
hundreds of miles _ are caused by Jupiter's immensely strong
gravitational pull.
</P>
<P>
   The planet is 300 times as massive as Earth, and thus its
gravitational pull is enormous.
</P>
<P>
   The orbit of Europa is slightly eccentric, alternately close to
Jupiter and farther away from it every 31/2 days on a path that is
influenced by its neighboring moons, Io and Ganymede.
</P>
<P>
   So when the little ice-covered moon _ about the size of Earth's
_ flies closest to the giant planet, Jupiter's powerful tug on
Europa's crust raises tides as high as 100 feet in the ocean
beneath the crust, Hoppa and his colleagues calculate.
</P>
<P>
   Those tides _ gigantic compared to Earth's, which average only
four to six feet high _ are what cause the ice to crack in Europa's
long chains of arc-shaped cycloids, according to Hoppa.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier radar observations have shown that Europa is covered by
a layer of water that may be as much as 100 miles deep, 20 times
greater than Earth's oceans. But whether all that water is frozen
solid down to the very bottom has long been one of the great
unknowns about the Jovian moon.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of EUROPA17 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The long chains of scalloped cracks in Euopa's surface form
extremely slowly, Hoppa explained in an interview. As the Jovian
moon begins to feel the strongest gravitational tug from Jupiter,
the ice starts its first crack. Then, with the moon rotating, the
crack takes on its curved shape and continues curving until the tug
from Jupiter subsides. When Europa's orbit carries it closest to
Jupiter once again, a new arc forms and the slow process begins
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could probably walk along with the advancing tip of a
crack as it was forming,'' Hoppa said, ``if you could survive
Europa's radiation environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The shape and nature of the scalloped cracks, as well as earlier
images of ``icebergs'' and alternating cracks and ridges on the
ice, indicate that the crust is probably eight to ten miles thick,
Galileo project scientists infer.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; x  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  As to the possibility of life in the relatively warm waters of
the great global ocean, Hoppa was reluctant to speculate.

Earth,'' he said, ``and there's a lot of chemistry there, but life

the report include B. Randall Tufts, Richard Greenberg and Paul E.
Geissler.

Space Administration is planning another spacecraft to orbit the
small moon and probe it with ice-penetrating radar to establish

what its nature might be. The spacecraft is due to be launched in
2003 and fly in orbit around the Jovian moon in 2008.

 CRACKS ON JOVIAN MOON SUGGEST DEEP SEA BELOW  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN

 UC HIRES EX-MILITARY SECURITY EXPERT TO PROTECT WEAPONS LABS  &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Stung by an international spy scandal, the
University of California has hired a counterintelligence expert to
oversee security at the nuclear weapons laboratories it manages.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond ``Terry'' Owens III, an Air Force colonel who directed
military counterintelligence during the air campaign over Serbia,
retired from the military Thursday and accepted a job with the UC
Office of the President, the UC Board of Regents was told.
</P>
<P>
   UC has come under fire in recent months for security breaches at
the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore weapons laboratories it
manages for the federal government. Owens has over 25 years of
experience in espionage and counterintelligence, with a specialty
in cybersecurity, and will work full time with the U.S. Department
of Energy and the labs to strengthen security.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, who will earn $128,000 annually, had earlier led efforts
to prevent terrorism against the United States and its overseas
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Owens' hiring could strengthen the university's position as it
increasingly falls under attack by Congress over its management of
the labs.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos director John Browne said outside the regents'
meeting that Owens provides the university with a necessary
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is to provide the university with some expertise to
deal with lab security people and DOE security people, someone who
can speak their language,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy's newly appointed security czar,
retired Air Force Gen. Gene Habiger, said through a spokesman
Thursday that Owens is the ``perfect selection at the right time
for a difficult job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that Terry Owens will provide a new focus on
security at the DOE labs run by the University of California,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The regents also heard Thursday that UC President Richard
Atkinson is recruiting new members for his advisory council on the
national laboratories. He will add national security experts to the
advisory panel, which traditionally has focused on science,
technology and environmental, health and safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The president's labs advisory council is currently studying how
U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson's new security policies are
being implemented at the laboratories, which UC has managed since
their inception more than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The university, which previously relied on the government for
security management, is taking a more active role since revelations
earlier this year that China had obtained highly sensitive weapons
information from spying at the labs. The security breaches have
prompted calls in Congress for the university to be held
responsible and have raised questions about whether national
security and scientific freedom should go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take our responsibility very seriously, and we are
dedicated to working with the DOE and other appropriate agencies,''
UC Vice President Wayne Kennedy assured the regents.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Browne and Livermore lab director Bruce Tarter
said they have stepped up security _ from new computer firewalls
and the hiring of 50 new guards at Livermore, to the controversial
plan to give lie-detector tests to nuclear weapons scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Regent Velma Montoya said she was pleased that UC has taken an
aggressive approach to security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, it is a moving target, and I like the fact that
we are trying to hit the moving target,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The regents also heard Thursday that Atkinson has called for his
lab advisory council to study cost overruns in construction of the
Livermore-based National Ignition Facility, a nuclear-weapons
testing system that relies on lasers, not physical testing.
</P>
<P>
   News of Atkinson's call for a financial review of construction
came hours after the announcement that a congressional committee
had demanded an investigation by the General Accounting Office into
why cost overruns at the National Ignition Facility of at least
$160 million _ and possibly up to $350 million _ were not revealed
until this month.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, officials at Livermore claimed  &LR; said the project
would be done on time and within budget. This month, they revealed
startling problems that will delay completion for at least a year.
Richardson has called for his own review and has pledged to hold
the university accountable for failing to disclose the problems
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, our reporting might have been more timely,''
said Susan Houghton, a spokeswoman for the Livermore lab director.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It doesn't get much better than this _ and that's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The current U.S. economy _ dubbed Goldilocks by many, because
like the perfect porridge it's neither too hot nor too cold _ faces
a number of scares in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three bears _ the Federal Reserve Board, China, and
YK2 _ is likely to be ferocious enough to send the fair-haired girl
tumbling out the window, but together they will be enough to keep
the stock market on edge for at least the remainder of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for more volatility as investors hop from sector to
sector and stock to stock trying to find one that's just right.
</P>
<P>
   The current stock market is priced for perfection. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index, for example, traded on July 16 at 36.97
times earnings for the previous 12 months. That record
price-to-earnings ratio fully incorporates what looks like a great
year for corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter U.S. equity strategist Peter Canelo,
for one, projects that earnings for the S&AMP;P 500 will increase by 14
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   No one needs to search too hard to find the forces behind that
whopping increase. The improving global economy has produced
growing sales volume for those multinational companies that took
the biggest hit in the global crisis of 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to firming prices for the goods they sell and very modest
increases in the costs of the raw materials and labor they buy,
corporations have seen those increased sales volumes multiply by
the time they hit the bottom line as earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Morgan Stanley estimates that non-farm worker
productivity in the U.S. increased by 2.6 percent in the year ended
in June 1999, the best rate of increase in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, because wages haven't climbed much while
productivity has, the cost of a unit of labor increased by less
than 1 percent during the same period. That's the first time in
three years corporations have seen their labor costs rise by less
than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This state of perfection can't last much longer _ according to
the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   In June, after almost a year of looking for the ghosts of
inflation without finding any, the central bankers found enough to
scare themselves into raising short-term interest rates by 25 basis
points (100 basis points equal one percentage point).
</P>
<P>
   In his July 22 testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan warned that the Fed didn't think one hike would
solve the problem. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which
had fallen below 5.9 percent, rapidly climbed back above 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers don't seem to make much of a case for a resurgence
of inflation, but a majority of the Fed governors are determined to
shoot first and ask questions later. And for investors, that
matters much more than the quality of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market believes the Fed is serious about raising rates,
and that will put downward pressure on stocks. The pressure is
likely to continue until the bankers remove the uncertainty by
actually doing what investors now fear.
</P>
<P>
   Look to May and June of 1999 as a model for how the markets will
behave _ sinking on the worry and rallying on the news, even if the
news is a rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that almost certainly would deter the Federal Reserve
would be a resurgence of the financial crisis that rocked Asia in
1998. The region is clearly not out of the woods yet. The recovery
in Korea and Thailand appears to be real, but fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Japan cannot convincingly shake its recession. And now China
shows signs that it is considering a devaluation of its currency,
the yuan, an act that would send the area back into turmoil. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese could be on the verge of a Japanese-style
deflationary spiral. Consumer prices have fallen in China for 21
consecutive months. At the same time, the Chinese savings rate has
climbed to 42 percent of household income _ people are putting
money away for an increasingly uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, growth in the gross domestic product has slowed in
each year since 1996, and last year China's economy grew by a
lackluster 4 percent, according to non-governmental economists (the
Chinese government claims GDP grew by 7.8 percent).
</P>
<P>

   Devaluing the yuan so that Chinese exports are cheaper is a
tempting short-term solution. It would undoubtedly produce a spike
in exports _ until China's neighbors responded with their own
devaluations and set off a trade war that no side would win and
that would be blamed on the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation would probably kill China's attempt to gain entry to
the World Trade Organization this year or next.
</P>
<P>
   That the Chinese are even willing to consider devaluation is a
sign of how dire the situation is. China's leaders know that a
deflationary spiral, once in place, can last for a decade or more _
all they have to do is look across the narrow sea for proof of
that.
</P>
<P>
   And domestic stability in China depends on strong economic
growth. China needs to add 7.5 million jobs a year just to hold
unemployment steady at the current 10 percent in cities and 30
percent in the countryside. The regime knows that the hope of a
better tomorrow is essential to contain potential unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting what China will do is almost impossible _ the
country's course of action depends on massive political and
complicated internal struggles.
</P>
<P>
   It is that unpredictability that will send the bond market (and
with it parts of the equity market) into a speculative tizzy from
time to time over the remainder of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Neither a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike (or two) nor the
devaluation of the yuan would mean the end of the world, but worry
over those two issues certainly helps set the stage for those who
believe the YK2 problem will cause the demise of civilization as we
know it. &QL;

<P>
   It doesn't get much better than this _ and that's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The current U.S. economy _ dubbed Goldilocks by many, because
like the perfect porridge it's neither too hot nor too cold _ faces
a number of scares in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three bears _ the Federal Reserve Board, China, and
YK2 _ is likely to be ferocious enough to send the fair-haired girl
tumbling out the window, but together they will be enough to keep
the stock market on edge for at least the remainder of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for more volatility as investors hop from sector to
sector and stock to stock trying to find one that's just right.
</P>
<P>
   The current stock market is priced for perfection. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index, for example, traded on July 16 at 36.97
times earnings for the previous 12 months. That record
price-to-earnings ratio fully incorporates what looks like a great
year for corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter U.S. equity strategist Peter Canelo,
for one, projects that earnings for the S&AMP;P 500 will increase by 14
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   No one needs to search too hard to find the forces behind that
whopping increase. The improving global economy has produced
growing sales volume for those multinational companies that took
the biggest hit in the global crisis of 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to firming prices for the goods they sell and very modest
increases in the costs of the raw materials and labor they buy,
corporations have seen those increased sales volumes multiply by
the time they hit the bottom line as earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Morgan Stanley estimates that non-farm worker
productivity in the U.S. increased by 2.6 percent in the year ended
in June 1999, the best rate of increase in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, because wages haven't climbed much while
productivity has, the cost of a unit of labor increased by less
than 1 percent during the same period. That's the first time in
three years corporations have seen their labor costs rise by less
than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This state of perfection can't last much longer _ according to
the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   In June, after almost a year of looking for the ghosts of
inflation without finding any, the central bankers found enough to
scare themselves into raising short-term interest rates by 25 basis
points (100 basis points equal one percentage point).
</P>
<P>
   In his July 22 testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan warned that the Fed didn't think one hike would
solve the problem. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which
had fallen below 5.9 percent, rapidly climbed back above 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers don't seem to make much of a case for a resurgence
of inflation, but a majority of the Fed governors are determined to
shoot first and ask questions later. And for investors, that
matters much more than the quality of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market believes the Fed is serious about raising rates,
and that will put downward pressure on stocks. The pressure is
likely to continue until the bankers remove the uncertainty by
actually doing what investors now fear.
</P>
<P>
   Look to May and June of 1999 as a model for how the markets will
behave _ sinking on the worry and rallying on the news, even if the
news is a rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that almost certainly would deter the Federal Reserve
would be a resurgence of the financial crisis that rocked Asia in
1998. The region is clearly not out of the woods yet. The recovery
in Korea and Thailand appears to be real, but fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Japan cannot convincingly shake its recession. And now China
shows signs that it is considering a devaluation of its currency,
the yuan, an act that would send the area back into turmoil. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese could be on the verge of a Japanese-style
deflationary spiral. Consumer prices have fallen in China for 21
consecutive months. At the same time, the Chinese savings rate has
climbed to 42 percent of household income _ people are putting
money away for an increasingly uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, growth in the gross domestic product has slowed in
each year since 1996, and last year China's economy grew by a
lackluster 4 percent, according to non-governmental economists (the
Chinese government claims GDP grew by 7.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The glut of manufactured goods such as televisions is so great
that even price cuts of 25 percent can't clear the market. In some
industries, companies have closed factories for months to reduce a
mountain of inventory. That, of course, just increases fear (and
cuts incomes) and sends consumer spending lower. &QL;
