<HEADLINE> Reward Offer for Capture of MILF Leaders Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada ordered Saturday the suspension of rewards for information
leading to the arrest of three top leaders of the secessionist
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said the president directed
Secretary Alfredo Lim of the Department of Interior and Local
Government to suspend the reward "until further notice."
</P>
<P>
The president made the decision to "allow the MILF the
opportunity to return to the negotiating table," said Puno, who is
the presidential spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The decision was in response to an appeal by President of the
Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines Orlando Quevedo and
former Ambassador Howard Dee during a closed-door meeting in
Cotabato City in the southern province of Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
Estrada returned to Manila Saturday after a three-day trip to
the south.
</P>
<P>
"They appealed for the lifting of the reward offer on the MILF
leaders in order to give the rebel group the opportunity to resume
active participation in the peace process," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Lim announced a reward of 5 million pesos
(about 110,000 dollars) for MILF Chairman Hashim Salamat, 3
million pesos (about 67,000 dollars) for its Vice Chairman for
Military Affairs Al-Haj Murad, and 1 million pesos (about 22,000
dollars) for its spokesman Eid Kabalu. All the three have pending
warrants of arrest against them.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the reward offer prompted the MILF to
suspend indefinitely the peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
The government's latest proposal was to hold the peace talks
next Monday or Tuesday in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MILF wanted the talks to be held in a third country, a
demand categorically rejected by the government.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which has been fighting for an independent Islamic
state in the southern island of Mindanao for two decades, called
for a jihad or holy war after its headquarters, Camp Abubakar,
fell to government forces early last month.

<HEADLINE> Last Person in Spy-related Case Freed on Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian state prosecution
decided on Sunday to free on bail the last person in connection
with a Egyptian-American professor suspected of Spying for the U.
S..
</P>
<P>
The state prosecutor's office ordered the release on 500
Egyptian pounds (150 U.S. dollars) of police officer Mohamed
Hassanein Emara, who is suspected of involvement in the making of
false voting papers for the professor Saad Eddin Ibrahim, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, a prominent activist who heads the Ibn Khaldoun Center
for Social Developments, and is a sociology professor at the
American University in Cairo, has been accused of receiving illegal
funding from abroad, forging voting cards, defaming Egypt, having
intelligence contacts with the United States and offering
enticements to employees of state television.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, along with four others, were released on August 10
after 40 days in detention.
</P>
<P>
Five more people were reportedly freed on Saturday by the
prosecutor's office on similar bail terms.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Jolts Eastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- At least nine people were injured
in a moderate earthquake that hit Erzurum, 900 kilometers east of
the Turkish capital of Ankara, early Sunday, reported the Anatolia
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The panicky residents jumped from balconies or out of the
windows in response to the 4.0-magnitude quake which rocked just
after midnight.
</P>
<P>
Of the nine injured, a soldier was critically wounded when he
threw himself out of the second floor of a military barracks.
</P>
<P>
Erzurum's Ataturk University Observatory announced that the
epicenter of the quake was some 30 kilometers southwest of the
city, just along the Palandoken fault. The quake was followed by
two aftershocks in the day.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, an earthquake measuring 6.8 degrees on Richter scale
rocked Erzurum, killing more than 1,300 people.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a quake-prone country, stretching along different
established quake belts.
</P>
<P>
Two strong earthquakes measuring over 7 degrees on Richter scale
devastated western Turkey late last year, killing nearly 20,000
people.

<HEADLINE> Norway Says Russian Sub Hatch Looks Intact, Air Inside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Norway's armed forces,
contradicting Russian reports, said Sunday that a hatch on the
sunken Russian submarine Kursk seemed intact with air inside and
that a rescue module might be able to open it.
</P>
<P>
"We have not drawn the conclusion that the hatch is so damaged
that it cannot be opened," said John Espen Lien, spokesman for the
Norwegian armed forces, after a team of three Norwegian divers
inspected the crippled Kursk, Reuters reported in a dispatch from
Oslo.
</P>
<P>
"The hatch is not destroyed and is in a fair condition...We
think it should be possible to open it with a British or a Russian
rescue capsule," he said.
</P>
<P>
Norway also said there seemed to be air behind the hatch,
contradicting Russian reports that it seemed flooded with a sailor
apparently trapped inside.
</P>
<P>
The Kursk went down to the bottom of the Barents Sea on August
12 while participating in a naval exercise of the Russian Northern
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Russian authorities said most of the 118 crew aboard probably
died within minutes of the accident and that there is slim hope of
finding any survivors.
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose nuclear submarine was commissioned for the
Russian Navy in 1995. It has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons
and can dive to depths of up to 500 meters.
</P>
<P>
The sub is armed with torpedoes and "Granite" cruise missiles,
but the Russian military said there was no nuclear warheads and
that the two nuclear reactors aboard have already shut down.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM, Jordanian King to Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah II will
travel to Tel Aviv Tuesday to hold talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak on how to push forward the stalled Israeli-
Palestinian talks, the Prime Minister's Office said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah and Barak will meet at the Defense Ministry in Tel
Aviv, the office added.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah will also visit the West Bank city of Ramallah the
same day and hold talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, it
was announced earlier.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second visit by Abdullah to Israel since taking
the Jordanian throne 18 months ago. He visited Israel's southern
port city of Eilat on April 23.
</P>
<P>
Barak visited Jordan Wednesday and held talks with Abdullah in
Amman, in which Barak briefed the king on the failed Camp David
summit under the host of United States President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Barak also urged Abdullah to help move the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks forward.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks focus on a complex array of disputes that
make up the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including land, security,
Palestinian sovereignty, water, Palestinian refugees, Jewish
settlements in the territories and the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat failed to reach a framework agreement on these
issues at the Camp David summit in the U.S. in July.

keenness to promote cooperation with Jordan especially in trade,
economic, agricultural and tourism fields.

NICOSIA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Drug abuse in Cyprus is on the
rise, local media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 247 people in Cyprus have been arrested for
involvement in 184 drug-related cases in the first seven months of
2000, compared to 354 people in 250 cases in 1999, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Chairman Yasser Arafat met European Union (EU) and Russian envoys
Sunday and briefed them on the latest developments of Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with EU Middle East envoy Miguel Moratinos,
Arafat urged greater EU support for the peace process and expressed
belief that the EU will back the Palestinian stand in the
peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
He also reasserted the commitment of the Palestinian people and
the leadership to the peace process and highlighted the EU role in
pushing forward the peace drive within the framework of the U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Moratinos renewed the position declared by the EU
on the Palestinian statehood. The EU recognized the right of the
Palestinians to declare a statehood.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also met on the day Russian Mideast peace envoy Vasily
Sredin and discussed with him the perils facing the peace process
due to "Israeli stubbornness and intransigence."
</P>
<P>
The PNA accused Israel of inaction in implementing the signed
accords and non-commitment to the resolutions of the international
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Nabil Amr
described the meeting between Arafat and Sredin as "very good and
important." It fell in the framework of the Palestinian active
diplomacy conducted recently by Arafat, Amr added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting the two leaders appraised the situation and
exchanged views on the peace process. Arafat may hold another
meeting with the Russian envoy before he leaves the region, Amr
added.
</P>
<P>
Sredin, for his part, said he offered some suggestions to Arafat
regarding the final status talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy noted that he would make intensive contacts
with the Israeli side in the coming two days and would meet Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, Sredin met Israeli acting Foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami in Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Russian Plane Concludes Humanitarian Mission to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A Russian plane left the Iraqi
capital Baghdad on Sunday after concluding its one-day humanitarian
mission in Iraq, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Ruslan Tsalikov, Russian deputy minister of civil defense and
emergency situations who came to Iraq aboard the plane, held talks
with Iraqi Interior Ministry Secretary Sadoon Al-Musleh on
promoting bilateral cooperation, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the two officials signed a minute on
cooperation in the fields of emergency treatment and civil defense,
the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Tsalikov, heading a 25-member official delegation, flied
directly from Moscow to the newly reopened Saddam International
Airport Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The airport in the west suburb of Baghdad was out of service at
the beginning of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq 10 years ago, which was
incurred by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Russian flight was was the first foreign aircraft that
landed at the airport since it was reopened on Thursday, and it was
also the first direct flight from Moscow since the end of the 1991
Gulf War, sparked by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Russian aircraft carried humanitarian supplies, mainly baby
food, medicine and medical equipment to sanctions-stricken Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, the Russian official told reporters that his
country did not ask permission from the United Nations Sanctions
Committee. "We just notified it," he said.
</P>
<P>
According the U.N. sanctions, flights must get permission from
the U.N. Sanctions Committee before they can fly to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Russia is an independent country with independent foreign
policy, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Russia, one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, has been a traditional ally and the biggest trading
partner of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz visited Moscow in July to
rally Russian support for Baghdad's efforts to have the decade-old
U.N. sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been calling for the removal of the sanctions and has
repeatedly urged the United States and Britain to stop patrolling
and bombing the two so-called no-fly zones in northern and southern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad does not recognize the Western allies-imposed zones for
their lack of proper U.N. authorization.

<HEADLINE> Fate of Missing Iranian Pilots Still in Balance: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The fate of two missing Iranian
pilots is still not determined five days after their helicopter
crashed into the Persian Gulf, the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Operations to seach for the pilot and co-pilot failed to come up
with favorable results, said the public relations department of the
Civil Aviation Organization.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter, which belongs to the Iranian Helicopter Services
Organization and chartered by the South Pars Company, crashed
Tuesday night near the Saga oil platform of the South Pars oil
field. No cause for the incident has been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
An Indian worker aboard the helicopter was injured. Two others,
an Iranian and an Algerian, were rescued unharmed.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that the two missing
pilots, Abolhassan Maleki and Sattar Nobar Zadeh, had been netted
by an American vessel on the spot and were still alive.
</P>
<P>
It has asked the Swiss embassy in Tehran, which also represents
U.S. interests in Iran, to launch a probe into the issue and
announce the results.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States denied on Thursday that the two
Iranian pilots had been picked up by its naval forces.
</P>
<P>
An intensive 16-hour search by U.S. Navy ships turned up no
bodies or survivor from the Iranian supply helicopter that crashed
in the Gulf, a Pentagon spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Calls for Rejection of Israeli Judaization of Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Sunday called on
the international community to denounce and reject Israel's
Judaization practices which infringe on the Islamic and Christian
sanctities of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ever since occupying Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast
War, Israel has been taking measures to judaize the holy city, a
move which is threatening the security of the Palestinian people
and the Middle East region as a whole, said a statement released by
the league on the eve of the 31st anniversary of setting ablaze Al
Aqsa mosque.
</P>
<P>
The mosque in Jerusalem, considered the third holiest Islamic
site, caught fire on August 21, 1969. Israel said it was set on
fire by an Australian, whom it maintained was insane. But the Arab
world accused Israel of committing arson.
</P>
<P>
Israel's incessant violations, including building settlements,
carrying out arbitrary practices against the Palestinian people and
land, "will not sap the spirit of the Palestinian nation and its
wise leadership," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Nor will the Israeli steps weaken the Palestinian resolve to
hold onto Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of a future
independent Palestinian state, it added.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem, sacred to Muslims, Jews and Christians, is now the
toughest issue in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. In 1980,
Israel declared the whole city its "eternal and undivided capital,"
a claim not recognized by the international community.

<P>
CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of Egypt and
Syria held talks Sunday evening in Egypt's Mediterranean port city
of Alexandria on regional issues and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Amr Moussa and Faruk Shareh focused on the
Arab-Israeli peace talks in light of the efforts exerted by the
concerned parties to push the peace process forward, and the status
of Jerusalem, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two officials discussed, in particular, the Egyptian
efforts, in coordination with other parties, for bridging gaps on
both the Syrian and Palestinian tracks, a well-informed source was
quoted as saying by the news agency.
</P>
<P>
After a brief resumption in December, Syria and Israel froze
peace negotiations in January due to failure to iron out
differences over the return of the Golan Heights Israel occupied
from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks are now stalled at the
status of Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Shareh also dwelt on preparations for a visit to
Egypt by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Bashar is expected to come to Egypt by the end of this month as
part of his first trip abroad since assuming power last month,
which reports said will also take him to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Shareh arrived in Egypt's second largest city earlier in the day
after a visit to Saudi Arabia. He is scheduled to meet with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Monday and hand him a message
from Bashar, the news agency said.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian divers are trying to
remove the upper hatch of the exit lock to enter Russia's Kursk
nuclear submarine with 118 crew that have been stranded at the
bottom of the Barents Sea for more than a week, Russian Deputy
Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Divers Trying to Enter Russian Sub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian divers are trying to
remove the upper hatch of the exit lock to entered Russia's Kursk
nuclear submarine with 118 crew that have been stranded at the
bottom of the Barents Sea for more than a week, Russian Deputy
Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The divers have located some spaces that are not filled with
water, which means that there is hope to find some sailors alive,
the state RTR television reported.
</P>
<P>
The 12 divers, divided into four 3-member groups to speed up
the operation, encountered difficulties earlier because their
instruments were not always compatible.
</P>
<P>
They have, however, managed to open the valve of the rescue
lock but cannot open the hatch, RTR reported earlier from the site
of the operation in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
RTR, quoting underwater examination reports, said that the
entire vessel is filled with water and pressure in the remaining
pockets of air aboard is very high. Experts hope that pressure has
remained at a level tolerable for human survival in some of them.
</P>
<P>
The weather is getting worse in the area with the wind growing
stronger and the sea becoming rougher, RTR said.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian divers examined "Kursk" earlier Sunday and
confirmed that the sub is seriously damaged -- its first two
compartments are practically destroyed and its escape hatch
heavily deformed.
</P>
<P>
Such damage would put into question the planned attempt by the
British mini-sub "LR5" to dock with the crippled submarine on the
Barents Sea floor, RTR television correspondent Arkady Mamontov
reported from the "Pyotr Veliky" cruise, where the rescue efforts
were coordinated.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov, who heads a government commission on the accident,
told RTR that the British rescue module will most probably fail to
dock with the Kursk and that all hope is now on the divers' manual
work.
</P>
<P>
All previous efforts to rescue the 118 crew aboard the vessel
have failed and Russian officials said Saturday that most of the
submariners probably died minutes after the Kursk went down to the
Barents Sea floor on August 12. Any survivors may already be dead
by now.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian reports, the divers would try to manually
unscrew a lid leading to the sub's escape chamber. Pressure-
measuring devices located inside the hatch would give the rescue
team an idea about conditions inside the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said the Kursk carries no nuclear weapons and
that the two nuclear reactors aboard have already shut down with
their radiation being at normal levels.

MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian divers are trying to
remove the upper hatch of the exit lock to enter Russia's Kursk
nuclear submarine with 118 crew that has been stranded at the
bottom of the Barents Sea for more than a week, Russian Deputy
Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov, who leads a government commission addressing the
disaster, said they have failed to open the damaged upper hatch,
so it has been decided to tear it off with a special crane.
</P>
<P>
The divers, who were apprehensive about going inside the
submarine because of their bulky special suits, have now decided
to make a try, Klebanov told the state RTR television.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers are being chosen and "there is confidence that
several people will agree," Klebanov said, adding that the
operation will be very difficult and the divers will first
rehearse it on special simulators.
</P>
<P>
The divers have located some spaces that are not filled with
water, which means that there is hope to find some sailors alive,
RTR reported earlier.

<HEADLINE> More Cars in UK Come From Continental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) - One-in-five British motorists will
buy a new car abroad this year as the car price differences here
and abroad grow, according to the latest research.
</P>
<P>
The British Independent Motor Trade Association, which
conducted the research, says the figures show that people are not
willing to pay inflated prices for new cars in the UK.
</P>
<P>
The research show that almost 20 percent of cars bought this
year will come from continental Europe. More than 140,000 private
customers are expected to buy right-hand drive cars abroad, a 100
percent increase on 1999.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that more than two million cars are
bought by Britons each year and private sales account for about 40
percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the British government ordered UK
manufacturers to cut their prices after it was revealed that
motorists were paying up to 12 percent more for cars than their
European counterparts.
</P>
<P>
New measures announced by Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen
Byers earlier this month mean that from September car dealers will
have to offer the same benefits to individuals as those buying
fleets of cars.
</P>
<P>
Car manufacturers said they welcomed the new order as a way of
ending the uncertainty over prices, which has put many consumers
off buying cars.

<HEADLINE> Secret Deal to Sell Part of BBC to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) - The BBC has taken the first steps
toward privatization in a secret sell-off deal with an American
production company.
</P>
<P>
The firm set to buy it for 4 million pounds (6 million U.S.
dollars) will continue to use the BBC name and logo, the first
time this has been allowed in the corporation's history, the
Sunday Express reported.
</P>
<P>
The ground-breaking project, codenamed "Operation Eliza", could
signal the beginning of a massive privatization program, with the
whole of BBC Worldwide up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that two British companies, each planning
joint ventures with the BBC, were also battling to clinch the deal.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper quoted an insider as saying that BBC
executives favored the American firm's buy-out package, which
would leave the corporation with a nominal 5 percent share holding.
</P>
<P>
The BBC has admitted negotiations were under way but refused to
reveal details. A BBC spokesman said: "We are in talks but I
cannot say whether it is about a sale or a partnership."
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations are confidential and we can't discuss them
further. We have certainly not accepted any offer. Beyond that I
can't comment," he added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Increase Education Spending: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong Sunday said that his country will increase spending on
education from 3.6 percent to 4.5 percent of GDP (Gross Domestic
Product) over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
This means an extra 1.5 billion Singapore dollars (about 0.88
billion U.S. dollars), said Goh while delivering his National Day
Rally speech.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to thousands civil servants and business leaders, Goh
said the government has decided to introduce compulsory education
in national schools up to primary six.
</P>
<P>
He said, in the New Economy every child needs to learn the
basics to enable him to keep learning new skills through his life.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged Singaporeans to bring about a culture of lifelong
learning as "acquiring knowledge and skills for the New Economy
cannot be a one-off process."
</P>
<P>
To support lifelong learning, he said, the government will
establish a new endowment fund-- the Lifelong Learning Fund from
budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
The Fund will eventually have 5 billion Singapore dollars (
about 2.92 billion U.S. dollars) while in this year the government
will allocate 500 million Singapore dollars (about 292 million U.S.
dollars) to kick off the fund, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Fund will support existing national training programs and
new training initiatives to make Singaporeans more employable, he
said.
</P>
<P>
One priority will be in the area of IT, he said, as the
government is developing a National IT Literacy Program that will
equip Singaporeans with the IT skills needed in the workplace and
at home.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A project aiming to divert water
from the Yellow River to north China's Tianjin Municipality was
officially launched recently.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, Tianjin has been hit by severe droughts for four
years running causing serious water shortages. Daily water
supplies have dropped to less than 1.7 million cubic meters from
more than 2 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The project will cover Shandong and Hebei provinces. The
project will be completed by October 15 this year, and water from
the Yellow, China's second largest, will arrive in Tianjin by
early November.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that this is the sixth time that Tianjin
has used water from the Yellow River.

<HEADLINE> Arafat's Upcoming Visit to Egypt Has Important Significance: Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The projected meeting on Monday
between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak has important significance for the Middle East peace
process, the Palestinian ambassador in Cairo said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Zohdi Qedra told Egypt's Middle East News Agency that Arafat is
keen on continuing consultations with Mubarak and get his advice on
the peace talks between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is reportedly to visit Egypt on Monday as part of his
continued coordination and consultations with Mubarak. He is to
brief Mubarak on his recent visits to three European states and
nine Asian countries in a bid to rally support for the Palestinian
positions on the peace process, Qedra said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will exchange views on the latest developments
of the peace talks and discuss the present situation in light of
the Israeli intransigence and failure to honor the international
legitimacy resolutions, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership and people appreciate the role played
by Mubarak as "a real and main sponsor of the Mideast peace process
in the region," the Palestinian diplomat stressed.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently visits Egypt to discuss the Mideast peace
process with Mubarak, who as the leader of the first Arab country
to make peace with Israel is a key mediator in the Arab-Israeli
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit on Monday will be his fourth to Egypt since July
25 when the Palestinian-Israeli summit at Camp David in the United
States ended without an agreement largely due to disputes over
Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament to Ban Armed Personnel From Entering Universities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's reformist-controlled Majlis
(parliament) in an open session here Sunday approved the outlines
of a bill prohibiting members of the armed forces from entering
universities or centers of higher education.
</P>
<P>
The outlines of the bill was approved after debates among Majlis
members and the views of Minister of Science, Research and
Technology Mostafa Moin were heard, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
But the bill has yet to be approved by some conservative-
dominated organs before it can become law.
</P>
<P>
In emergency cases, the ban will be lifted only at the request
of the university chancellor, the minister of science, research and
technology and the minister of health, according to the bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill actually aims to prevent the re-occurrence of the
clashes between police and students in Tehran University last year,
which sparked the most serious riots in Iran since the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
On July 8, 1999, police and plainclothes men raided a Tehran
University dormitory to crack down on students who had protested
against conservative restrictions on the press.
</P>
<P>
The incident sparked six days of bloody riots in Tehran and
other cities. At least one person died and a number of others were
injured in the unrest, which also led to the trial of some police
officers.
</P>
<P>
Reformers claim that there had been a conservative plot behind
the student dormitory incident and insist that the case be
thoroughly investigated and those responsible be punished.
</P>
<P>
But last month the conservative military court acquitted the
major suspects in the dormitory incident, including former police
chief of Tehran Brigadier General Farhad Nazari.

<HEADLINE> Arrow Missiles in Base Only in Emergencies: Israeli Investigator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli investigator who
was authorized to examine the potential harms of stationing an
Arrow anti-missile system at a northwestern site, has recommended
that the missiles be brought to the base only in times of
emergency.
</P>
<P>
Hagai Merom, a former head of the Knesset (parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee, was appointed arbiter after
residents of Ein Shemer, about 150 kilometers north of Jerusalem,
said they would be exposed to the electromagnetic field of the
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Merom said on Sunday his research into the issue had revealed
that there is no proof at this stage that the missiles' presence
could be harmful but that it might turn out to be so in the future.
</P>
<P>
He therefore recommended that the base should remain empty all
year and the Arrow missiles should arrive at the site only in times
of emergency.
</P>
<P>
The official in charge of the Arrow project at the Defense
Ministry, Arye Herzog, said however that this was not feasible. He
said it would not be possible to assemble the missiles only in
times of emergency, and that a special committee on defense matters
should discuss the issue again.
</P>
<P>
Merom had earlier led a five-month investigation into the health
threats that an Arrow system might pose to residents living nearby.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference last Thursday over the issue,
Merom said the best way would be to exercise preventive safety and
not expose the residents to electromagnetic energy, which has been
shown harmful to human health.
</P>
<P>
Herzog argued that the defense ministry held that the Arrow
system does not pose a health risk as the system meets the
standards for electromagnetic emissions set by the World Health
Organization and the residents' homes are far from the area of peak
radiation.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the press conference, Environment Minister
Dalia Itzik said the environmental debate over the Arrow system was
only beginning, hinting that the defense ministry would fight
Merom's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to act against the army," Itzik said, "but it is
unacceptable that security considerations will get priority over
the residents' health."
</P>
<P>
The environment minister added that Prime Minister Ehud Barak
will have to make the final decision.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-funded Arrow anti-missile system is designed to track
incoming missiles and intercept missiles between 10 and 40
kilometers above the ground.

WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Hope and despair clashed dramatically on Sunday as the saga
of the nuclear submarine Kursk drew to a close. Only hours before
British and Norwegian rescuers arrived at the Barents Sea site of
the sunken sub, Russia officials acknowledged that the vessel's
entire 118-member crew is almost certainly dead.
</P>
<P>
-- A week before his trip to Africa, President Bill Clinton
signed a bill on Sunday to set up a global trust fund for AIDS
patients that has been likened to a kind of Marshall Plan against
the infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Moving on several fronts to capitalize on the afterglow of
their conventions, the presidential contenders plan next week to
open the biggest television advertizing blitzes of their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
-- Two years after Californians voted to end bilingual
education and force a million Spanish-speaking students to immerse
themselves in English as if it were a cold bath, those students
are improving in reading and other subjects at often striking
rates, according to standardized test scores released this week.

<HEADLINE> Divers Face Difficulties in Opening Russian Sub Hatch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian divers are facing
difficulties on the stranded Russian nuclear submarine Kursk
Sunday because their instruments are not always compatible for the
rescue job.
</P>
<P>
The divers have managed to open the valve of the rescue lock
but cannot open the hatch, the state RTR television reported from
the site of the operation in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
The RTR, quoting underwater examination reports, reported that
the entire vessel is filled with water and pressure in the
remaining pockets of air aboard is very high. Experts hope that
pressure has remained at a level tolerable for human survival in
some of them.
</P>
<P>
The 12 divers have divided into four groups of three members
each to guarantee non-stop rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
The weather is getting worse in the area with the wind growing
stronger and the sea becoming rougher, the RTR said.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian divers examined "Kursk" earlier Sunday and
confirmed that the sub is seriously damaged -- its first two
compartments are practically destroyed and its escape hatch
heavily deformed, Russian state television reported.
</P>
<P>
Such damage would put into question the planned attempt by the
British mini-sub "LR5" to dock with the crippled submarine on the
Barents Sea floor, RTR television correspondent Arkady Mamontov
reported from the "Pyotr Veliky" cruise, where the rescue efforts
were coordinated.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who heads a government
commission on the accident, told the RTR that the British rescue
module will most probably fail to dock with Kursk and that all
hope is now on the divers' manual work.
</P>
<P>
All previous efforts to rescue the 118 crew aboard the vessel
have failed and Russian officials said Saturday that most of the
submariners probably died minutes after Kursk went down to the
Barents Sea floor on August 12. Any survivors may already be dead
by now.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian media reports, the divers would try to
manually unscrew a lid leading to the sub's escape chamber.
Pressure-measuring devices located inside the hatch would give the
rescue team an idea about conditions inside Kursk.
</P>
<P>
"Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It has
a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of up
to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "Granite
" cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said Kursk carries no nuclear weapons and that
the two nuclear reactors aboard have already shut down with normal
radiation levels.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi Vows to Revitalize Itself Through Science, Technology (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Northwestern China's Shaanxi
Province today said it plans to revitalize itself through science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
Fan Xiaomei, a leading provincial official of the province,
said the 36 million people in the province have been deeply
encouraged by the central government's decision to develop the
country's vast impoverished west, which includes the province and
nine other provinces and regions.
</P>
<P>
"With our unique geographic position, rich natural resources
and strong capability in research and education, we are confident
that Shaanxi will be prosperous again in the next century."
</P>
<P>
Emperor Shihuang's magnificent terra-cotta warriors and horses
unearthed in the province, described as the seventh wonder of the
world, is just one of the several reminders of the province's past
glories.
</P>
<P>
The province was once the political heart of 11 ancient Chinese
dynasties, including the Qin Dynasty, founded by China's first
Emperor Shihuang, the Han Dynasty, and Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Fan told the reporters that 4,800 scientists and scholars will
meet next month in the province's capital Xi'an to discuss the
latest development in sciences and the strategy to develop the
west.
</P>
<P>
"Shaanxi has decided to promote high-tech industries by relying
on science and technology, structural innovations and giving full
play to the market".

<P>
The province is home to 54 institutes of higher learning and
about 275 research institutes.
</P>
<P>
The province will also encourage the development of passenger
plane industry, high-tech farming industry in arid areas, and
build the province into one of the country's key energy and
petrochemical industrial centers, said Fan.
</P>
<P>
With its revenue totaling 11 billion yuan (about 1.3 billion U.
S. dollars), tourism industry will possibly be another growing
sector of the province's economy as Shaanxi is abundant in tourism
resources.
</P>
<P>
"We are relatively strong in machinery, electronics,
pharmaceutical and military industry".
</P>
<P>
There are 1,740 state-owned or controlled industrial firms in
the province with total assets valued at nearly 220 billion yuan (
26.5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Xi'an, the largest city and communications hub in northwest
China, is capable of providing commerce, trade, communications,
financial and information services for the whole northwestern part
of China.
</P>
<P>
She said the provincial economy has been growing faster than
the national average in the past four years. Investment in fixed
assets has been increasing sharply during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"The most amazing good news is a growing number of
professionals coming to Shaanxi to start business, in a sharp
contrast to a brain drain in the past several years," said Fan.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Dumping Measures Must Be Strengthened: Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah
A.M.S. Kibria Sunday called upon the industrialists to enhance the
quality of Bangladeshi products to halt the dumping of foreign
goods in the country under open market order.
</P>
<P>
"Dumping of foreign goods under open market policy destroys
domestic industries and raises product prices gradually," Kibria
said while speaking at a seminar on "Anti-dumping and
Countervailing Duty Measures" jointly organized by Dhaka Chamber
of Commerce and Industry (DCCI) and the Center for International
Private Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Minister said some of the domestic industries are
facing stiff competition due to imports of foreign items with
unrealistic prices. National Board of Revenue has been asked to
see which imports subject to dumping, he added.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization cell in the Ministry of Commerce
needs to be strengthened to monitor the progress of anti-dumping
measures and take countervailing action, Kibria said, urging the
chamber leaders to prepare a strategy to face the global open
market order and to keep in mind the country's interest and profit
while importing foreign items.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote paper presented by the DCCI, Consultant Syed
Jamaluddin Ahmed said domestic products are facing serious
competition from imported goods due to substantial trade
liberalization. Anti-dumping investigation and countervailing
actions must be strengthened to protect local industries, he added.
</P>
<P>
There are unconfirmed reports that several items including
ceramic, glass, bicycles, medicines, detergent, dry cell battery
and electronic products are being subsidized and dumped by
countries like India, China, Japan, Australia, Malaysia and South
Korea, he claimed.

<HEADLINE> Two Spanish Police Officers Killed in Suspected ETA Bombing Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Two Spanish Civil Guard police
officers were killed in northern Spain on Sunday when a bomb blew
up their patrol car, an official statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the agency of the Spanish government in
Aragon Autonomous Region blamed the bombing attack to notorious
terrorist organization ETA, which has waged a 32-year-long
campaign for independence and was presumed to have been behind six
killings since mid-July.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the bomb had been placed by ETA in
the patrol car and exploded when the car was passing the town of
Sallent de Gallego, Huesca province, at 6:10 a.m. A female
officer was killed instantly. Her male colleague died from his
injuries in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja and State Secretary for
Defense Pedro Morenes rushed to the scene to launch investigation
and express condolence to family members and colleagues of the
dead.
</P>
<P>
Two Spanish main opposition parties -- the Socialist Workers'
Party and the United Left -- released statement respectively on
Sunday accusing terrorist acts of ETA.

<HEADLINE> Divers Face Difficulties in Opening Russian Sub Hatch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian divers are facing
difficulties on the stranded Russian nuclear submarine Kursk
because their instruments are not always compatible for the job.
</P>
<P>
The divers working on the sub's rescue lock are measuring the
hatch they will have to open and reporting the information to the
surface, the Russian state RTR television reported.
</P>
<P>
A special workshop aboard the Norwegian ship "Seaway Eagle" is
making the necessary instruments. Three divers are currently
working on the sunken sub.
</P>
<P>
The weather is getting worse in the area with the wind growing
stronger and the sea becoming rough, the RTR said.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian divers examined "Kursk" earlier Sunday and
confirmed that the sub is seriously damaged -- its first two
compartments are practically destroyed and its escape hatch
heavily deformed, Russian state television reported.
</P>
<P>
Such damage would put into question the planned attempt by the
British mini-sub "LR5" to dock with the crippled submarine on the
Barents Sea floor, RTR television correspondent Arkady Mamontov
reported from the "Pyotr Veliky" cruise, where the rescue efforts
were coordinated.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who heads a government
commission on the accident, told the RTR that the British rescue
module will most probably fail to dock with Kursk and that all
hope is now on the divers' manual work.
</P>
<P>
All previous efforts to rescue the 118 crew aboard the vessel
have failed and Russian officials said Saturday that most of the
submariners probably died minutes after Kursk went down to the
Barents Sea floor on August 12. Any survivors may already be dead
by now.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian media reports, the divers would try to
manually unscrew a lid leading to the sub's escape chamber.
Pressure-measuring devices located inside the hatch would give the
rescue team an idea about conditions inside the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
Pressure within the vessel must be low enough to provide for
survival.
</P>
<P>
"Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It has
a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of up
to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "Granite
" cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said Kursk carries no nuclear weapons and that
the two nuclear reactors aboard have already shut down with normal
radiation levels.

<HEADLINE> Russia wins Manila Leg of Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua)) -- World's No. 1 Russia Sunday
displayed a championship poise in the fifth deciding set to
dethrone crowd-favorite Brazil for the Manila leg title of the
2000 World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Lioubov Chachkova-Sokolova, considered to be the world's best
woman volleyball player, spearheaded Russia's mighty comeback from
7-11 down while Elizaveta Tichtchenko added support that enabled
the Russians to win the closely-fought match 25-18, 18-25, 20-25,
25-19, and 19-17 in one hour and 48 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Olivera Elisangela, playing her best in the three day third leg,
put Brazil on a 15-14 margin in the fifth set but the Russian
defense awarded the latter two straight points.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians, last year's Manila leg champions, tied the
deciding set at 17-17 but Silva Raquel committed a crucial service
error, giving Russia the lead before Tichtchenko sealed their win
with a powerful spike match point.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians bounced back from the first set lost, banking on
solid spike of rookie Erika Coimbra and Oliviera to lead Brazil in
winning the next two sets for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
However, the Brazilians failed to control the tempo of the
match in the fourth set as the taller and stronger Russians leaned
on Elena Godina, who scored six of her 15 points in the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
With their win, the Russians swept the Manila leg while
improving their overall win-loss record to 8-1 going into the
final leg next week here.
</P>
<P>
The loss was Brazil's second in nine matches, failing to avenge
its loss to Russia in last year's finals of the tournament, the
third prestigious after the Olympic Games and the World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians played without crowd-darling Leila Barros in the
last four sets but Coimbra and Oliveira stepped up with 21 and 17
points. Waleska Oliveira also scored 17 points to no avail.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's first match, Asia's top team South Korea finally
clinched its first win here after sweeping winless Italy, 25-23,
25-17, 26-24, bouncing back from two defeats to Russia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the South Koreans, who nearly upset the Russias last
Friday, improved their record to 3-6 while the Italians skidded to
1-8 winning the 3rd and fouth place of the Manila leg respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barros may not have got enough playing time but she
remained the Most Popular Player while Chachkova was adjured Most
Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
Coimbra was named best spiker while teammates Raquel Silva and
Ricarda Libra the best server and the best libero plum,
respectively. Russia's Gamova Ekaterina cornered the best blocker
award.
</P>
<P>
Each of the individual awardee received 5,000 us. dollars
except for the MVP who got 20,000 dollars while the Manila leg
champions Russia pocketed 40,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The overall champions of the tournament will receive 150,000
dollars, second placers 90,000 dollars, third placers 40,000
dollars, fourth placers 35,000 dollars. The 6th-8th finisher also
get cash prizes.
</P>
<P>
The four teams -- Cuba, China, the United States and Japan --
from China's preliminary leg will arrive here Wednesday to join
Brazil, Russia, South Korea and Italy for the final event slated
August 24-27.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Lacquerware and the Lacquer Industry of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua)-- A live TV broadcast today
exhibited lacquerware, still shining brilliantly and dating back
more than 2,000 years. They were unearthed from the Laoshan Tomb
of the Western Han Dynasty (206 BCE- 24 A.D.) in the western part
of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Lacquerware are considered to be one of the most valuable
funeral objects of the Han Dynasty (206 BCE.- 220 A.D.), according
to archeologists.
</P>
<P>
Lacquerware are metal or wooden objects covered with
transparent or opaque lacquer.
</P>
<P>
Pines are usually used as the base for Chinese lacquerware
while pottery, copper and some other materials were also used.
</P>
<P>
The key characteristic of lacquerware is that it could be
polished to have the same luster as porcelain.
</P>
<P>
China's lacquer using history can be dated back as early as
over 7,000 years ago during the Neolithic Age, earlier than China
began to make porcelain in the late 3rd century.
</P>
<P>
During the Spring and Autumn Period (770- 476 B.C.) and the
Warring States Period (475- 221 B.C.), lacquerware were quite
popular among the aristocracy. The patterns of the lacquerware
describe animal images and various aspects of human life.
</P>
<P>
The lacquer industry developed rapidly during the Han Dynasty (
206 BCE- 220 A.D.). The Ming and Qing dynasties from about 14th
century to early 20th century were considered to be the most
booming period of the lacquerware sector, when the production
techniques reached remarkably high levels.
</P>
<P>
China got lacquer from the varnish tree, but after the middle
of the Qing Dynasty (1644- 1911), oil paint was introduced to
China from western countries. The chemical paint was invented
after the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
Large amounts of Chinese lacquerware went to Japan during the
6th century with the spread of Buddhism and to Europe during the
Emperor Kangxi's reign (1654- 1722)

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Calls for Drought-Relief Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
has called for redoubled efforts to fight against the drought that
has ravaged the country since spring.
</P>
<P>
The drought, the most severe since 1978, has hit 20 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities in China. It has not only
brought heavy losses to crops but also caused food shortages in
some rural areas and water shortages in some cities.
</P>
<P>
At a work conference on drought relief held in Shijiazhuang,
capital of north China's Hebei Province, on Friday, Wen urged
local officials to take concrete steps to ensure food and water
supplies.
</P>
<P>
He said that taxes and fees in the drought-striken areas should
be reduced or canceled according to state regulations.
</P>
<P>
Droughts serve as a warning in a country which has low per
capita water resources and increasing water demands due to social
and economic development, he said. Priority should be given to
water-saving efforts and improvement of water efficiency, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Maps Out 10-Year Personnel System Reform Outline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The General Office of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee today made public an
outline to further make reforms in the country's cadres and
personnel system from 2001-2010.
</P>
<P>
The outline consists of 26 articles in five chapters, focusing
on basic objectives and guiding principles, reform for the Party
and government officials; and personnel reform for state-owned
enterprises and government institutions.
</P>
<P>
According to the outline, by 2010 China will set up a cadre and
personnel system that would be compatible with building socialist
economics, politics and culture with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year personnel reform is expected to provide high-
quality cadres that the Party can rely on to represent the
development requirements of China's advanced social productive
forces, the progressive course of China's advanced culture, and
the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Laws and regulations will be enacted to curb malpractices and
corruption in personnel promotions, the outline says, stressing
that more democracy will be introduced into cadres selection.

<HEADLINE> Travelog: Turpan, A Dreamland for Archeologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TURPAN (XINJIANG), August 20 (Xinhua) -- Traveling in Turpan
Basin of Xinjiang Autonomous Region, you would feel like visiting
a vast archeological exhibition in the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
Turpan Basin, a desert area in northwest China "is the world's
richest open museum for archeologists", Gunnar Jarring, a Swedish
sinologist, once said.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have discovered lots of historic relics in the
area, including towers, grottoes, castles and tombs, which remind
people of the past prosperity and glory of ancient kingdoms.
</P>
<P>
According to history records, since Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.
D.), Chinese had set up local administrations or helped establish
some small kingdoms in the basin area.
</P>
<P>
Some ancient cities in the area were so splendid at the time
that they attracted many officials, businessmen and monks from
inland areas of China and foreign lands including ancient Persia
and India.
</P>
<P>
Turpan Basin once served as the trading ground for merchants
from the East and the West as almost all the greatest
civilizations in the world have had their relics left in Turpan,
according to historians.
</P>
<P>
Relics excavated from Turpan could provide evidences and clues
for people to study ancient cultures in China, India, Persia and
the nomadic life in the north.
</P>
<P>
Turpanology, or Study on Turpan, and Study on Dunhuang are the
two largest academic projects for those who are interested in the
research of ancient Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to "Kariz", these ancient relics have survived hottest
Summer temperatures, 47 centigrade degrees on average in July.
</P>
<P>
"Kariz" is a kind of underground canals built by local people
to prevent water from evaporation. There are nearly 1,000 "Kariz"
canals in Turpan Basin, with a total length of 5,000 km, which is
called one of the three ancient projects in China. The other two
are Great Wall and Grand Canal.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM's Constitution Plan Draws Mixed Reactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's promise to deliver a constitution within a year has
triggered reactions from all corners of the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Barak has instructed cabinet ministers Yossi Beilin, Shlomo Ben-
Ami and Michael Melchior to draw up a constitution that will deal
with such issues as civil marriages, national service for all and
the abolition of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, and promised to
present it to the Knesset (Parliament) within a year.
</P>
<P>
Barak unveiled the plan for the first time in a meeting with
cabinet ministers on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Likud leader Ariel Sharon Sunday accused Barak of
acting in disregard of negative public opinion polls and said Likud
will give its views only after studying the proposals, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Eli Yishai, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, said
Barak's irresponsible proposals with the start of a national
election campaign were harmful to the Jewish tradition of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak of the Center Party, on
the other hand, aired his backing for the proposals, but said they
must not be at the expense of the peace process with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
His party colleague Dan Meridor, Chairman of the Knesset's
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, believed the proposals would
gain extensive support in the public and in the Knesset,
particularly in the large parties, the Labor and Likud.
</P>
<P>
He said that objections by the ultra-Orthodox parties were a
distortion of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Meretz leader Yossi Sarid, former education
minister, supported Barak and called on him to combine the
proposals with a new educational and social policy.
</P>
<P>
Knesset Member Eliezer Zandberg from the secular Shinui Party,
however, expressed skepticism over the prime minister's
determination to carry out the proposal. He pointed out that Barak
had changed his mind over the recruit of ultra-Orthodox youths into
the army and that he might change his mind again.
</P>
<P>
Barak had vowed to draft all Israeli youths to the army while
campaigning for the premiership last year but backed down on his
words to vote for the Tal report in June which called for the
deferral of yeshiva students' army service.
</P>
<P>
Also in reaction to Barak's plan, Knesset Member Meir Porush
from the religious United Torah Judaism party said Barak had put
together a collection of old proposals by Meretz and Shinui and was
acting in a hysterical manner.
</P>
<P>
Barak told his cabinet ministers Saturday night that he intended
to implement the plan following the accomplishment of three of the
targets he had previously set for himself, namely, the pullback of
Israeli forces from Lebanon, a stronger economy, and an advancement
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Barak said "The national
agenda has now changed: after the withdrawal from Lebanon and
putting the economy on its feet, it is time to raise the flag of
social issues."
</P>
<P>
He noted that he would continue simultaneously with efforts
towards peace with Israel's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said he would bring the proposed constitution before all the
parties and expressed his assurance that large sectors of the Likud
would be in favor.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel was an extremely heterogeneous society
and that it had to march forward, alongside the most developed
nations in the world, on the basis of a united infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Israel has not formulated a complete constitution since its
establishment 52 years ago, and has been in operation under a set
of basic laws.

<HEADLINE> German Plane in Iraq on Humanitarian Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A German plane carrying four
people arrived at the newly-reopened Saddam International Airport
on Sunday on a humanitarian mission to sanction-stricken Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"My visit to Iraq is to pick up a sick person in Baghdad and fly
to Turkey as soon as possible," Robert Fleischmann, captain of the
aircraft, told reporters upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
He said that he received order from his company, the non-profit
German Air Rescue, to go to Iraq to pick up a Swedish woman who
is "very sick," along with her husband and their daughter.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that they will leave here later in the day after
picking up the patient.
</P>
<P>
Fleischmann said that the flight has got permission from the
United Nations Sanctions Committee. "I do not have any problems in
getting permission (from the U.N. Sanctions Committee) for the
flight," he said.
</P>
<P>
The small plane from Germany had a stopover in Ismil, Turkey and
arrived at the Saddam International Airport at the local time 12:20
(0820 GMT), becoming the second foreign plane to arrive at the
airport after it was reopened on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There was a small delay on the way to Baghdad before I got
permission to land at the airport," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he denied that he knew anything about the Russian flight
which arrived at the same airport one day ago.
</P>
<P>
A Russian plane, carrying Russian Deputy Minister for Civil
Defense and Emergency Situations Ruslan Tsalikov as well as an
official delegation, landed at the airport on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq reopened the airport on Thursday after it was closed for 10
years, to welcome planes from "friendly countries."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions ever since its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait. Under the sanctions, all flights to or from Iraq must
get prior permission from the U.N. Sanctions Committee.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Prays for enlightenment of Moro Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada prayed Sunday for the enlightenment of Moro rebels so they
would unite with him in working for a just peace for all Filipinos,
especially those in war-torn Mindanao in the south.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 16th anniversary of a Christian organization,
El Shaddai, here, the President said it is time to leave behind
the time of war, and embrace the time of peace.
</P>
<P>
"I ask the MILF (Moro Islamic Liberation Front) and the Abu
Sayyaf to leave behind the old tune of war. This is not timely. If
they continue to treat me as an enemy, I will pray for them in
return.
</P>
<P>
I do not reject them but extend to them the hand of peace, yet
I must remind them that Mindanao and any part of our society are
not just for a few but for all Filipinos," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada later joined El Shaddai head servant Mike Velarde and
his followers in praying for the hostages abducted by the Abu
Sayyaf from Malaysia's diving resort of Sipadan in April and their
captors in the southern island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
They prayed that the Abu Sayyaf see the light of "giving" and
eventually release the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf rebels freed three Malaysians Sunday morning,
bringing to 11 the number of the released of the Sipadan group.
They are still holding 10 others they seized from Sipadan.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, they prayed for the MILF and their followers to
understand that God created all people equal.
</P>
<P>
The president also urged all Filipinos to set aside their
religious differences and turn their backs on the time of hate and
war, so the nation can move towards a time of peace.
</P>
<P>
He said his efforts to develop Mindanao are for all Filipinos,
adding that this can be achieved only through unity.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Divers Confirm Serious Damage to Sunken Submarine EDS-Update with Klebanov remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Norwegian divers who examined
the sunken Russian submarine "Kursk" earlier Sunday confirmed that
the sub is seriously damaged -- its first two compartments are
practically destroyed and its escape hatch heavily deformed,
Russian state television reported.
</P>
<P>
Such damage would put into question the planned attempt by the
British mini-sub "LR5" to dock with the crippled submarine on the
Barents Sea floor, RTR television correspondent Arkady Mamontov
reported from the "Pyotr Veliky" cruise, where the rescue efforts
were coordinated.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who heads a government
commission on the accident, told the RTR that the British rescue
module will most probably fail to dock with Kursk and that all
hope is now on the divers' manual work.
</P>
<P>
All previous efforts to rescue the 118 crew aboard the vessel
have failed and Russian officials said Saturday that most of the
submariners probably died minutes after Kursk went down to the
Barents Sea floor on August 12. Any survivors may already be dead
by now.
</P>
<P>
"Most possibly, we will have to admit that our worst
expectations have materialized," Vice Admiral Mikhail Motsak,
chief of the Northern Fleet, told a special program on RTR
television Saturday in the starkest statement so far.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian media reports, the divers would try to
manually unscrew a lid leading to the sub's escape chamber.
Pressure-measuring devices located inside the hatch would give the
rescue team an idea about conditions inside Kursk.
</P>
<P>
Pressure within the vessel must be low enough to provide for
survival.
</P>
<P>
The weather conditions have improved markedly in the area of
the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
There is still no final word on what caused the accident, but
Motsak, the chief of the Northern Fleet, said there were three
possible versions.
</P>
<P>
The first is a powerful dynamic blow that may have occurred on
collision with another object.
</P>
<P>
Motsak said three foreign submarines were spotted in the
accident zone, which is an area under constant observation by
foreign intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
He said Kursk's collision detonated three or four torpedoes,
resulting in a blast equivalent to 1-2 ton of TNT.
</P>
<P>
The second is an explosion inside the submarine with subsequent
flooding of the sub's first and second compartments.
</P>
<P>
And the third possible cause is that Kursk hit a World War II
mine, the admiral said. The final suggestion should not be
completely discarded since six such mines have been discovered in
that part of the Barents Sea over the last few years, he added.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Team Not Allowed in Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) has rejected an appeal by Afghanistan's Taliban
Militia to be allowed to send a team to the Sydney Olympics next
month, according to a news dispatch reaching here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the IOC officials, the report said that a delegation
from the Taliban travelled to Lausanne last week to make the
request.They were told that their team cannot participate because
the Taliban administration is not internationally recognised.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban are suggesting that the IOC is discriminating
against them because they do not propose sending any female
athletes to the Games, said the report.
</P>
<P>
With only weeks to go before the Games, a spokesman for the IOC
has said that the Taliban will not be allowed to enter the Games
until it is internationally recognised as Afghanistan's legitimate
government. And so far, there is no sign of that happening.

<HEADLINE> Ninety-Eight Percent Pensioners Receive Payment on Time: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 98 percent of
pensioners in China had received their monthly payment on time by
the end of June, according to Minister of Labor and Social
Security Zhang Zuoji.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that during the 18 months prior to June, more than
17 billion yuan worth of defaulted pension payments had been paid
in addition to 400 billion yuan worth of due payments.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the China Development Forum on Social
Security Reform sponsored by the Development Research Center under
the State Council of China today.
</P>
<P>
According to a government decree issued last month, all
localities around the country are required to pay every cent of
defaulted pensions and allowance to ensure the basic living of
laid off workers by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to avoid recurrence of default of pension payment, the
country has started to switch pension distribution from
enterprises to banks and post offices.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, more than 18 million people are now
receiving pension payments through banks and post offices. By the
end of the year, all pensioners will obtain their payment from
banks and post offices.
</P>
<P>
The number of people buying basic retirement insurance had
grown from 112 million to 129 million. The number of people
purchasing unemployment insurance also grew from 80 million to 100
million while those who received monthly unemployment payment grew
from 700,000 to 1,280,000.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 6.7 million laid-off workers from state-
owned enterprises. So far 90 percent of them have secured basic
living with the help of the government.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that China has helped more than 12 million laid off
workers have found new jobs in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the central and local governments of China
have increased social security budget expenditure. For example,
the central treasury allocated over ten billion yuan to social
security schemes in 1998. The figure grew to 20 billion yuan last
year.

<HEADLINE> Minister Outlines Goals of Social Security Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

improving the fledging social security system in the near future,
Minister of Labor and Social Security Zhang Zuoji said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told an international forum sponsored by the Development

central government, that the first task is to establish stable
financing channels in the social security system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the China Development Forum on Social Security
Reform, he said that the second task is to set up a nation-wide
unemployment insurance scheme to secure the basic living of laid
off workers.
</P>
<P>
The third task is to further standardize the guarantee system
of minimum living standards of urban citizens. He noted that China
now is expanding the scope of this minimum living benefits to all
low-income earners, the unemployed and retirees who are below the
threshold of average household incomes.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Door to Peace Talks With Syria Still Open: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The door to peace negotiations
between Israel and Syria is still open, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The door is still open for serious peace talks with Syria,"
Barak told cabinet ministers in the weekly cabinet meeting, Barak's
office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks deadlocked in January after the
two sides held two rounds of talks in the United States, due to
Israel's refusal to hand over to Syria the entire Golan Heights
which Israel occupied during the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The two sides resumed their peace talks last December after a
break of nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
Barak did not say what measures his government will take to
renew the Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Cairo on Sunday said that Syria is expecting to
renew contacts with Israel in October, following the resumption of
the Israeli-Palestinian talks. The renewal of Israeli-Syrian peace
talks is reportedly due to come up during the talks between the
Syrian and Egyptian presidents in Cairo at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak told the cabinet that there is no sign from the
Palestinian side that they are willing to discuss the ideas raised
at the Camp David summit on solving the sensitive issue of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It will only come clear in the coming weeks whether Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat wants a peace agreement or a deadlock, Barak
said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-day Camp David summit ended at the end of July without
reaching any framework agreement on final-status issues such as
Jerusalem, borders, refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Following the summit, Arafat launched an international diplomacy
aimed at rallying international support for the declaration of an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Barak also sent his ministers abroad to counter Arafat's efforts
for seeking international support.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross returned to the region
Thursday to see whether the two sides are ready for another summit.
</P>
<P>
Ross told Barak on Friday that U.S. President Bill Clinton plans
to meet separately with him and Arafat during the U.N. General
Assembly meeting next Month.

<HEADLINE> Karachi Airport's New Runway Ready to Conduct Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The new runway of Quaid-e-Azam
International Airport in Karachi completed at a cost of 700
million rupees (13 million dollars) is ready to operate national
and international flights, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 3,400 meter long and 45 meter wide runway has an overrun of
300 meters. It is built on the old runway which at the time of
independence was used for light aircrafts.
</P>
<P>
In 1960, the runway proved inadequate to handle the increasing
air traffic so the present runway was constructed, which is used
till now.
</P>
<P>
A modern lighting system including additional central lights,
touch down lights, precision approach and simple approach lights
is installed at the runway.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Manila Hoping Peace Talks with MILF Push Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
hoping that peace talks with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (
MILF) will push through next week, said a senior government
official.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting the MILF to be ready for the peace talks on
the appointed date," Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in
radio interviews over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The government had proposed that peace talks with the MILF
resume on Monday and Tuesday at places in the southern island of
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that the government is also ready to take
appropriate action if the separatist group totally abandons the
peace talks and follows a war policy.
</P>
<P>
"If their panel does not show up, we will explore other options.
But it is hard to tell, we don't want to telegraph our moves," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said, however, that the government remains confident
that back-channeling efforts will continue and will be fruitful. "
We will be there. We will be attending the peace talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
To give the rebel group "the opportunity to resume active
participation in the peace process", President Joseph Estrada
Saturday ordered the suspension of rewards for information leading
to the arrest of three top MILF leaders.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Secretary Alfredo Lim of the Department of
Interior and Local Government announced a reward of 5 million
pesos (about 110,000 dollars) for MILF Chairman Hashim Salamat, 3
million pesos (about 67,000 dollars) for its Vice Chairman for
Military Affairs Al-Haj Murad, and 1 million pesos (about 22,000
dollars) for its spokesman Eid Kabalu. All the three have pending
warrants of arrest against them.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the reward offer prompted the MILF to
suspend indefinitely the peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
The MILF had demanded that talks be held in a third country,
but it was rejected by the government.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which has been fighting for an independent Islamic
state in Mindanao for two decades, called for a jihad or holy war
after its headquarters, Camp Abubakar, fell to government forces
early last month.
</P>
<P>
The military linked the MILF to recent bombings and massacres
of civilians in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Train Explosion Kills 16 Near Kenya's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- At least 16 people died when a
train carrying gas exploded and caught fire early Sunday morning
at the Athi River railway station, 30 kilometers southeast of
Kenya's capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred shortly after midnight, engulfing the
people sleeping in several houses on one side of the railroad,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The 16 bodies were burnt beyond recognition and the other 37
people were seriously injured. Three were admitted to intensive
care units in nearby hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident was under investigation, according to
police.
</P>
<P>
The roofs of the houses were ripped off and the debris
scattered in the houses. Grass and trees near the railroad were
burnt to ashes. The railway wooden sleepers were still burning
several hours after the explosion.
</P>
<P>
However, the driver of the train escaped from death, police
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Train was ferrying gas tankers from the Kenya Petroleum
Refinery in the Indian Ocean city of Mombasa to Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
It was the second fatal train accident in a week in the east
African country after Tuesday's passenger train derailment in
western Kenya, killing 13 people and injuring scores.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Media Center Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The biggest media center in
Olympic history, Sydney Olympic Main Press Center, was unveiled
Sunday to the world's press.
</P>
<P>
The 40,000 square meter facility will be home to 5,500
journalists and photographers during the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
At the unveiling of the Main Press Center (MPC), International
Olympic Committee Vice-President Kevan Gosper said it was the best
he had ever seen at an Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
"In recent times I've seen some excellent press centers," he
said. "But I don't know any that provides better facilities or
layout."
</P>
<P>
The center was previously a series of cattle and horse
pavilions.
</P>
<P>
It was converted into the media headquarters in just four
months at a cost of 25 million Australian dollars (15 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
MPC Venue Manager Reg Gratton has worked on the project for
four years to ensure that journalists and photographers have the
best facility possible.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the Games is judged by the world's media," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We learnt a lot from previous Games in what was needed in
press operations and the MPC to ensure the media receive reliable
and accurate information in purpose built facilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The MPC is fitted with more than 500 TV sets, 2,000 phone lines
and five press conference rooms with capacities of up to 800
people.
</P>
<P>
Before and during the Olympics 200 press conferences will be
held at the center.

<HEADLINE> Australian Track and Field Team Aims at Top Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian Olympic track and
field head coach Chris Wardlaw Sunday stood by his aim of
Australia finishing at the top five at the Olympics, despite mixed
performances at the national trials which ended Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wardlaw admitted he would like to have seen a few more athletes
achieve A standards a month out from the Games.
</P>
<P>
Injuries to javelin throwers Louise Currey and Joanna Stone and
distance runner Clair Fearnley - all of whom were named on the
team Sunday - were the major disappointment of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
To finish in the top five at the Olympics for the first time in
over 30 years, Australia needs to out-perform countries like
Britain and Italy.
</P>
<P>
"In a trial situation, people do what they have to do to
qualify," said Wardlaw. "I'm very happy with the team as selected.
"
</P>
<P>
Wardlaw singled out discus thrower Lisa-Marie Vizaniari, now
ranked 11th in the world, as the most consistently under-rated
athlete in the Australian team.
</P>
<P>
He also praised long jumpers Peter Burge and Jai Taurima, pole
vaulter Emma George and sprinter Matt Shirvington - whose 100m
time of 10.11 was his best on home soil - for their efforts over
the last three days.
</P>
<P>
Forty-three athletes achieved automatic selection at the trials
in an Australian team which now numbers 83.
</P>
<P>
The only events where the host nation will be unrepresented in
Sydney are the men's discus and the women's long jump and shot put.

China Bans Dishonest Practices in Student Insurance Market
</P>
<P>
China warned of severe punishments on insurance companies using
administrative forces and other dishonest means to sell accident
insurance policies to students.
</P>
<P>
The warning by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC)
came at a time when students are returning to school after their
summer vacation.
</P>

Student accident insurance is cheap and popular. But some
insurance companies have been using administrative forces to
expand their market share or even monopolize local markets.

 College Enrollment Expansion Causes Mixed Feelings
</P>
<P>
Chinese universities and colleges planed to enroll a total of 2.
04 million students this year, up 24.4 percent from last year's,
which has caused mixed feelings among some Beijing-based schools.
</P>
<P>
In the past two or three years, Chinese universities and
colleges kept expanding their enrollment, partly decided by the
government.
</P>
<P>
This practice inevitably led to downslide of enrollment quality,
according to some educational experts.
</P>
<P>

China to Restrict Digging in Grassland
</P>
<P>
China is considering limiting digging plants which can be used
for traditional herbal medicine in grassland.
</P>
<P>
Digging for wild plants and herbs usually destroys grass
growing around them, resulting eventually in the environmental
destruction. If excessive digging continues, the great Hulunbuir
Pasture which has a grassland of 149 million mu, or 9.98 million
hectares, will become a desert within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Major herbal plants being dug for include liquor ice, Chinese
ephedra, Chongcao (Chinese Caterpillar fungus) and Facai, a
precious wild vegetable.
</P>
<P>
Warm Water, Slow Wind Blamed for Triggering Bohai Red Tides
</P>
<P>
Higher water temperatures, the sun and the wind are blamed for
triggering frequent outbreaks of large-scale red tides last month
in the polluted Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
Li Xingming, an expert with the China Maritime Supervision
Corps under the State Oceanic Administration of China, said
excessive nitrogen and phosphorus pumped into the sea are the main
reasons for four red tides last month.

China's Industrial Belt Struggles to Control Pollution
</P>
<P>
Northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang have
been making every effort to meet State deadlines in controlling
industrial pollution.
</P>
<P>
In a decision to control growing industrial pollution following
18 years of high economic growth, the central government vowed
four years ago to close down all the polluting industrial firms
that failed to meet industrial pollution discharge standards set
by both the central and local governments by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of June only 82 percent of the
13,800 firms in Liaoning had met the standards, while 73 percent
of the 5,600 firms in Jilin and 75 percent of the 2,900 firms in
Heilongjiang were up to standards.
</P>
<P>
Coast Shelter Forest Expanding in Southwest China
</P>
<P>
More than 98 percent of the coastline in southwest China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have been afforested, forming a
strong shield against typhoons.
</P>
<P>
Coast Shelter Forest Project is one of the 10 major ecological
construction projects in China. Since Guangxi started this project
in 1987, its acreage of the shelter forest has grown by 25,000
hectares annually with 1,230 kilometer-long coast line greened.
</P>
<P>
Officials with Guangxi's forest bureau attributed the rapid
expansion of shelter forest mainly to local governments' enhanced
efforts, scientific afforestation and active participation on the
part of local farmers and fishermen.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Divers Reach Sunken Russian Sub, Check Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian divers have descended
to the sunken Russian nuclear submarine "Kursk" and are tapping
along the hull to establish which compartments have been flooded,
Russian media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
All previous efforts to rescue the 118 crew aboard the vessel
have failed and Russian officials said Saturday that most of the
submariners probably died minutes after the Kursk went down to the
Barents Sea floor on August 12. Any survivors may already be dead
by now.
</P>
<P>
"Most possibly, we will have to admit that our worst
expectations have materialized," Vice Admiral Mikhail Motsak,
chief of the Northern Fleet, told a special program on RTR
television Saturday in the starkest statement so far.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian reports, the divers would try to manually
unscrew a lid leading to the sub's escape chamber. Pressure-
measuring devices located inside the hatch would give the rescue
team an idea about conditions inside the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
Pressure within the vessel must be low enough to provide for
survival. The divers would also assess chances for the British
mini-submarine to latch on to the damaged escape hatch.
</P>
<P>
There is still no final word on what caused the accident, but
Motsak, the chief of the Northern Fleet, said there were three
possible versions.
</P>
<P>
The first is a powerful dynamic blow that may have occurred on
collision with another object.
</P>
<P>
Motsak said three foreign submarines were spotted in the
accident zone, which is an area under constant observation by
foreign intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kursk's collision detonated three or four torpedoes,
resulting in a blast equivalent to 1-2 ton of TNT.
</P>
<P>
The second is an explosion inside the submarine with subsequent
flooding of the sub's first and second compartments.
</P>
<P>
And the third possible cause is that the Kursk hit a World War
II mine, the admiral said. The final suggestion should not be
completely discarded since six such mines have been discovered in
that part of the Barents Sea over the last few years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who heads a
government commission probing the causes of the accident, said the
crewmembers in the first, second and possibly several subsequent
compartments of the submarine died instantly when the Kursk struck
the seabed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, Klebanov said that there is still a chance that some
sailors may still be alive in the eighth and ninth sections, but
that this chance is more of a theoretical nature, Interfax
reported.

LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Russian navy said Saturday night there was virtually no
hope of finding any survivors aboard the stricken nuclear-powered
submarine Kursk.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Health officials fear that Britain's transplant program
could be set back years by a controversy over claims that brain-
dead donors may feel pain while their organs are being removed.
</P>
<P>
The Independent on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- British farmers' fear of a consumer boycott of pork are
proved unfounded as sales and consumption stay steady despite the
swine fever outbreak.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- The icecap at the North Pole has turned into water the first
time in 50 million years. Scientists aboard a Russian icebreaker
have discovered an ice-free patch of water a mile wide at the top
of the world.

<HEADLINE> British, Norwegian Begins Attempt to Rescue Russian Submarine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The joint British and Norwegian
began on Sunday attempt to rescue any survivors on board the
sunken Russian submarine Kursk, which is lying on the sea bed in
the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
A British Defense Ministry spokesman said here that Norwegian
divers with video surveillance equipment have been sent to the
bottom of the Barents Sea to assess the situation and that their
conclusions will determine whether it will be possible to use the
British LR5 submersible.
</P>
<P>
He said "every possible efforts" should be made to help the
Russian sailors while there is any chance of survivors being found.
</P>
<P>
But British Armed Forces Minister John Spellar told the BBC the
recovery of bodies was the responsibility of the Russians.
</P>
<P>
Pictures from the underwater camera reportedly confirmed damage
to the Kursk's escape hatch was quite serious. The damage is
thought to be one reason behind the repeated failure of Russian
rescuers to gain entry to the vessel.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreed rescue plan, Norwegian divers would first
attempt to enter the submarine's airlock. The British team would
then attempt to maneuver the LR5 onto the Kursk and form an
airlock through which any surviving crew could escape.
</P>
<P>
The international effort is seen as the last slim hope for
survivors after devastating explosions wrecked the front sections
of the nuclear-powered submarine and sent it plunging 108 meters
to the seabed on August 12.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Russia's deputy prime minister Ilya Klebanov said the
crew of the Kursk were almost certainly all dead. He said their
chances of survival were "largely theoretical."

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Divers Confirm Serious Damage to Sunken Sub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Norwegian divers who examined
the sunken Russian submarine "Kursk" earlier Sunday confirmed that
the sub is seriously damaged -- its first two compartments are
practically destroyed and its escape hatch heavily deformed,
Russian state television reported.
</P>
<P>
Such damage would put into question the planned attempt by the
British mini-sub "LR5" to dock with the crippled submarine on the
Barents Sea floor, RTR television correspondent Arkady Mamontov
reported from the "Pyotr Veliky" cruise, where the rescue efforts
were coordinated.
</P>
<P>
All previous efforts to rescue the 118 crew aboard the vessel
have failed and Russian officials said Saturday that most of the
submariners probably died minutes after the Kursk went down to the
Barents Sea floor on August 12. Any survivors may already be dead

<HEADLINE> Chinese Archaeologists Excavate Beijing Imperial Tomb (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The growth of urbanization has endangered a spade of historical
relics across the country. Deputies to the National People's
Congress, China's top lawmaking body, have sternly criticized the
wrongdoings that have damaged cultural heritage in three Chinese
cities, Anyang, Dinghai and Zunyi.
</P>
<P>
Rampant smuggling and illegal auctions of cultural relics also
became the target of public accusation.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wuyu, site director with the Beijing Research Institute of
Cultural Heritage, said that the excavation of Laoshan ancient
tomb is the most deliberate and scientific one he has ever engaged
in. Local government, commercial establishments, and the public
have been supporting the protection of the mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
Some archaeologists estimated that the occupant of the tomb was
a king of a principality with eminent position. The tomb is of
great importance for studying ancient culture.
</P>
<P>
Han dynasty which lasted for over 400 years is the second
dynasty after Qin (221 B.C. to 207 B.C.) that reunified China. It
made China for the first time the most powerful empire in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Beijing belonged to part of the northeast frontier of Western
Han Dynasty in history. It served as a strategic place to keep out
marauding nomads and a place where different nationalities lived.
</P>
<P>
Heritage of Han dynasty has long been an academic focus for
Chinese archaeologists. The gate to tracing back lost Chinese
culture was opened when Confucian classics copied on silk and
bamboo or wooden scraps were unearthed from a series of tombs
dating back to that period in southern China.
</P>
<P>
"This is an exciting excavation," said Beijing vice-mayor Liu
Jinmin, adding that "it reflects the importance a future-prone
nation has attached to its own history."
</P>
<P>
The outer casket and the coffin could be seen when the
excavation ended this morning. The coffin would be opened in mid-
September, Wang Wuyu estimated.

The first victim was the owner of the 18-meter well in Jarba,
240 kilometers south of the capital city Amman, who went down the
well on Friday to repair the pump but fell into the water after
fainting due to the lack of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
A family member met with the same fate after he went down to
rescue the owner, as was a third relative who attempted to come to
their rescue, police said.
</P>
<P>
Two civil defense employees then climbed down the well, but the
rope supporting them snapped and they fell into the water and were
drowned as well.
</P>
<P>
Then a villager and another civil defense worker tried
unsuccessfully to rescue the victims but were overpowered by the
lack of oxygen, and were lifted to the ground and sent to a nearby
hospital.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President to Visit Egypt Within August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is
expected to pay a visit to Egypt within this month, Al Ahram daily
newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad's visit is likely to take place at the end of August,
the pro-government daily quoted a Foreign Ministry official as
saying. Egypt will be the first stop of his first trip abroad,
which will also take him to Saudi Arabia, since he came to power
last month, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the Syrian president will hold talks with his
Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak on the latest developments of
the Middle East peace process, especially on the Syrian track, and
ways of further promoting bilateral relations, the official said on
customary condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
After a brief resumption in December, Syria and Israel froze
again their peace talks in January due to disputes over the return
of the Golan Heights that Israel occupied from Syria in the 1967
Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh is coming to Egypt on
Sunday to prepare for al-Assad's visit and hold talks in the
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa on the Syrian-Israeli peace process, reports
have said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Shareh will meet with Mubarak in Alexandria and
deliver a message to him from al-Assad.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Begin Search for U.S. "Convert Spy": Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police Sunday started
searching for Jeremiah Mattysse, a lieutenant-colonel in a U.S.
army intelligence unit, who converted to Judaism, deserted the army
and is believed to be hiding in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The police began their search at the request of the Prime
Minister's Office and the U.S. Embassy, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Mattysse's girlfriend, Ricky Nir, reiterated in a radio
interview Sunday morning that he had fled incognito to Syria. She
said she had received a call from him, via a public call box, to
say he had successfully crossed the border.
</P>
<P>
Media here said that Mattysse headed a secret intelligence unit
in the American Navy with access to top secret files on various U.
S. spy agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli General Security Services have reportedly also
offered their assistance to the American authorities, but have not
become involved in the case at this stage.
</P>
<P>
A lot of information available on the U.S. officer was provided
by his Israeli girlfriend, Nir, who has promised an exclusive of
her story to the leading Israeli newspaper Yedioth Aharanoth.
</P>
<P>
Nir, 48, quoted by Israeli paper Ha'aretz as saying that
Mattysse had experienced several spiritual epiphanies in his life
and often changed his religion. He had been a Roman Catholic, a
Buddhist and a member of various other faiths before ending up as
an Orthodox Jew who sought to come to Israel to join a yeshiva.
</P>
<P>
Nir said that in January, the U.S. authorities allegedly told
him that he was suspected of spying for Israel. She later changed
her story and said espionage was never an issue, reported Haaretz
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The navy moved him from his sensitive post and allowed him to
take a vacation. He disappeared and made his way to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Nir said that he brought with him four duffel bags full of
secret materials which he deposited in bank safes and that he was
very cautious and feared kidnapping and assassination.
</P>
<P>
The officer in question, according to Nir, also tried to contact
Israeli intelligence in exchange for political asylum but received
no response.
</P>
<P>
Mattysse has been officially charged with desertion, absence
without leave, and conduct unbecoming an officer after failing to
return to duty.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Nir said, two civilians approached Mattysse as
Israeli General Security Service agents, saying that they had
decided to help him because their superiors would not. Nir said
they helped Mattysse slip into Syria.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates has become one of the
world's largest producer of date palms, with the number of this
unique plant rising to 40.1 million, according to a recent
statistical study by the Emirates News Agency (WAM).
</P>
<P>
The UAE now produces more than 37 types of dates from 33.7
million palms in Abu Dhabi and 6.3 million in the Northern
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- General Motors's units sales in the Middle East
region during the first seven months reached 21,500, nearly doubled
the sales of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
While its target of the whole year was set at about 40,000,
however, the U.S. automaker has recorded its highest summer sales
figures in the region since 1993.
</P>
<P>
"With sales of more than 10,500 vehicles in May, June and July,
it's been our best summer period since 1993. In July, we also had
our best monthly figure of 3,995 units since 1995, a year when we
actually had more products in the market," the United Arab Emirates
official news agency quoted Stuart Pierce, GM's regional marketing
director as saying.
</P>
<P>
The gains were partly due to the introduction of all-new
versions of the Chevrolet Caprice, Suburban, Cadillac DTS, the GMC
Yukon, Chevrolet Tahoe and Opel Omega.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- With most companies in the Gulf region now
suffering from an absence of skeleton staff as a result of the
annual escape-heat exodus, delays have been reported recently in
cargo movements.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest newsletter from the Sea Consortium, there
are "a few reported delays" in the "fairly normal port operations"
in the Gulf as of July.
</P>
<P>
While, in Dubai port and Jebel Ali, productivity only ranged
between 21 to 23 moves/hour/gantry, with the usual vessel
congestion at Dubai from Tuesday through Wednesday, and at Jebel
Ali from Monday to Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the installation of two new Super Post-Panamax gantry
cranes in Jebel Ali has been completed and went into operation on
July 15. Both cranes are capable of handling 20 containers across.
In Khor Fakkan and Abu Dhabi, routine port operations prevailed
with productivity averaging at 18-22 moves/hour/gantry.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Oman will no longer levy income-tax on profits
earned by a company through investment in shares of other
companies, according to a recent amendment to the Income Tax Law on
Companies.
</P>
<P>
Marine companies have been allowed similar tax breaks, reported
Dubai-based English Daily "Gulf News" on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
For Omani companies, including those with mixed ownership the
exemptions are effective July 1, 2000. Foreign companies will be
allowed the facility from the date of commencement of their direct
operations in Oman, provided these exemptions do not violate
previous terms.
</P>
<P>
The amendment aims at wooing investors to boost the national
economy, still largely dependent on oil income.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Foreign Debts Over 50 Percent of GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's foreign debts,
which were 9.7 billion U.S. dollars 20 years ago, have risen to 35
billion dollars in 1999-2000 which is about 54 percent of the
country's GDP, a local newspaper Frontier Post reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said this sharp increase in external debts was also
accompanied by harder term, since the proportion of loans
available on confessional terms has been declining.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the increase in domestic debts has been even
sharper from 60 billion Rupees in 1979-1980 to 1,520 billion
Rupees(about 30 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999-2000. This is equal
to about 46 percent of the country's GDP.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, the country's total external and
domestic debts are now 65 billion U.S. dollars or 3,340 billion
Rupees, which, in terms of proportion of the country's GDP, have
increased from 66.5 percent in 1979-1980 to 100 percent in 1999-
2000.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) has rejected an appeal by Afghanistan's Taliban
Militia to be allowed to send a team to the Sydney Olympics next
month, according to a news dispatch reaching here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the IOC officials, the report said that a delegation
from the Taliban travelled to Lausanne last week to make the
request. They were told that their team cannot participate because
the Taliban administration is not internationally recognized.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban are suggesting that the IOC is discriminating
against them because they do not propose sending any female
athletes to the Games, said the report.
</P>
<P>
With only weeks to go before the Games, a spokesman for the IOC
has said that the Taliban will not be allowed to enter the Games
until it is internationally recognized as Afghanistan's legitimate
government. And so far, there is no sign of that happening.

the tomb of Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C. to 24 A.D) is only some
10 kilometers from the city center where the Palace Museum stands.
It is the second mausoleum of Han dynasty ever discovered in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
It was regarded as the third most important archaeological
discovery in Beijing over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
In the front chamber of the tomb, archaeologists cautiously
brushed off the clay on the lacquerware and pottery. Lacquerware
is rarely seen in tombs of Han dynasty in north China. What makes
these pieces more precious is that they are inlaid with gold
plates of different designs, including that of clouds and flying
tigers.
</P>
<P>
A senior archaeologist was invited to the site to explain to
audience what the unearthed objects were and what they were used
for.
</P>
<P>
Beijing-based foreign correspondents also went to the site
surrounded by apartment buildings, hotels and a large amusement
park.
</P>
<P>
The site was heavily guarded when archaeologists were digging
in front of cameras.
</P>
<P>
The ancient tomb came to the limelight when the police seized
several ghouls attempted to crawl into the tomb.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the ongoing excavation, Beijing has unearthed
paleolithic ruins at a construction site in the downtown
commercial area of Wangfujing and a 300-year-old tomb in the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> UAE Newspaper Criticizes Israeli Goods Flow in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A United Arab Emirates' leading
newspaper Sunday criticized the extensive flow of Israeli goods
recently into the Yemeni markets.
</P>
<P>
Commenting editorially on the issue, the Abu Dhabi-based Arabic
Daily "Al Ittihad" said that the Yemeni Markets had witnessed
recently extraordinary flow of Israeli goods, whereas these goods
are demonstrated openly at stores, shops and business firms by the
virtue of its low priced.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that, according to news agencies, many shops
present these products at the capital Sanaa and other several
cities like Aden, Taiz, Hudaidah and Mukalla with a price cheaper
that their similars.
</P>
<P>
"The trial of invading the Arab markets has been a technique
always adopted by the Israeli exporters since a long time ago and
it comes in the framework of a policy in finding markets for
Israeli products in the Arab countries, but the awareness of the
Arab peoples always succeeded to abort these bids," said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"What is serious in this matter is that, the Israelis are not
satisfied by invading the Yemeni markets with their goods only,"
the paper warned.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States has requested Israel's help in finding a
lieutenant-colonel in a U.S. Army intelligence unit who converted
to Judaism, deserted the army, and is believed to be hiding in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The lieutenant-colonel's Israeli girlfriend hinted on Saturday
that he may have been spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Except confirming that Lt.-Col. Jeremiah Mattysse is missing
and Israel is helping look for him, both U.S. and Israeli officials
are keeping mum about the case.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz is considering ordering
the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) to stop erecting new outposts and
fences in the Galilee area to protest against the Finance
Ministry's refusal to follow the prime minister's instructions to
restore 688 million shekels (about 170 million U.S. dollars) that
was cut from the defense budget last year.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz has said he would not conduct an assessment of the
strategic and operational situation in the general headquarters
until he received the official figures of the budget.
</P>
<P>
According to the general staff, the money saved by not having
soldiers in Lebanon, and the treasury's promise to allocate 800
million shekels (about 200 million dollars) in two years, do not
make up for the 1.4 billion shekels (about 350 million dollars)
invested in erecting the new fence.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) in Israel claimed two more
drowning victims on Saturday with the death of two sisters from
East Jerusalem. The two victims have brought to 15 the number of
drownings since the summer season opened.
</P>
<P>
The increased drownings in the Kinneret is believed to be the
result of a drop in the water line, bringing the shore closer to
deep water. Victims walk in shallow water and can then unexpectedly
plunge to depths of more than two and a half meters.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak says he is in no hurry to
form a new coalition and will wait until the end of September
before announcing a new government.
</P>
<P>
Barak met with the ultra-Orthodox Shas Chairman Eli Yishai on
Friday afternoon but they did not specifically discuss Shas'
returning to the government.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Channel 2 on Friday night, Barak said he intends
to establish a new government by the end of September. He promised
that this new alignment will be suited to address circumstances
arising during the knesset (Parliament) winter session, including
voting on the state budget.

<HEADLINE> Road Deaths in Cyprus Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Road deaths in Cyprus so far this
year is 75, up 36 percent from 55 in the same period of 1999, local
media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, there were 111 road deaths and 3,916 injuries. The year
of 1999 saw 113 deaths and a small decline in the number of
injured.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, a small Mediterranean island, has a population of some
670,000, remains the third worst European country as far as road
accidents are concerned. On average, 18.3 per 100,000 people died
in road accidents in Cyprus every year, which badly exceeded the
European average of 12 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Last year Greece had the second highest number of road
fatalities with 20 deaths per 100,000 and Portugal on the top with
23.
</P>
<P>
At the recent fatality rate, there's a strong possibility that
the
island's record death toll of 133 set in 1994 could be surpassed
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, 87 percent of drivers or
passengers in Cyprus killed in accidents in the last ten years
were not wearing seat belts and 91 percent of motorcyclists killed
were not wearing helmets.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-Aided Rescue Efforts Continue, Hope Dim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- British and Norwegian rescuers
joined their Russian counterparts late Saturday in efforts to
rescue the Kursk nuclear submarine that has been stranded at the
bottom of the Barents Sea for a week.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the northern port city of Murmansk, where the
rescue efforts were headquartered, said Norwegian divers with
video equipment have started to descend to Kursk Sunday morning in
a final bid to find possible survivors aboard.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian officials said Saturday that all 118
submariners were probably dead.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian and British teams were brought to the disaster
site by two Norwegian ships which moved into position above the
mangled Kursk before dawn.
</P>
<P>
The divers, working at a depth of about 100 meters, would
assess the damage suffered by the submarine when it sank August 12,
a task that would take "several hours," a spokesman for the
British Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian reports, the divers would try to manually
unscrew a lid leading to the sub's escape chamber. Pressure-
measuring devices located inside the hatch would give the rescue
team an idea about conditions inside the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
Pressure within the vessel must be low enough to provide for
survival. The divers would also assess chances for the British
mini-submarine to latch on to the damaged escape hatch.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Navy announced Saturday that most of the crew
apparently died when a massive explosion shattered the Kursk on
August 12, slamming it to the bottom of the sea. The authorities
said most of the Kursk's crew apparently died in the first minutes
of the disaster, and that any survivors likely drowned as the ship
filled with water.
</P>
<P>
"Most possibly, we will have to admit that our worst
expectations have materialized," Vice Admiral Mikhail Motsak,
chief of the Northern Fleet, told a special program on RTR
television in the starkest statement so far.
</P>
<P>
Russian rescuers continued struggling to reach the submarine,
but were hampered by powerful currents and near-zero visibility on
the seabed.
</P>
<P>
The escape hatch they were trying to reach at the rear of the
submarine is badly damaged, and repeated efforts to dock have
failed.
</P>
<P>
There is still no final word on what caused the accident, but
Motsak, the chief of the Northern Fleet, said there were three
possible versions.
</P>
<P>
The first is a powerful dynamic blow that may have occurred on
collision with another object.
</P>
<P>
Motsak said three foreign submarines were spotted in the
accident zone, which is an area under constant observation by
foreign intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kursk's collision detonated three or four torpedoes,
resulting in a blast equivalent to 1-2 ton of TNT.
</P>
<P>
The second is an explosion inside the submarine with subsequent
flooding of the sub's first and second compartments.
</P>
<P>
And the third possible cause is that the Kursk hit a World War
II mine, the admiral said. The final suggestion should not be
completely discarded since six such mines have been discovered in
that part of the Barents Sea over the last few years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who heads a
government commission probing the causes of the accident, said the
crewmembers in the first, second and possibly several subsequent
compartments of the submarine died instantly when the Kursk struck
the seabed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, Klebanov said that there is still a chance that some
sailors may still be alive in the eighth and ninth sections, but
that this chance is more of a theoretical nature, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
As the nation and the world pray for the sailors aboard the
Kursk, the relatives of the submariners are having an especially
hard time. The government has allocated funds to help those that
have arrived at Murmansk and other places near the accident site.
</P>
<P>
In one moving episode, the director of a train bound for
Murmansk turned off the speakers of a carriage that housed the
relatives of the Kursk crew -- to stop them from hearing radio
broadcast of comments from military officials that the
submariners' chance of survival was almost zero.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, donations are being collected for the
relatives and religious ceremonies held to pray for the crew's
safe return.

BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Journalists
Association today called on journalists across the country to work
harder and have a greater sense of social responsibility to greet
the country's first "Journalists' Day" which falls on November 8.

<P>
The central government also allocated 300 million yuan from
the money raised through a loan for the construction of Liaoning's
wastewater plants.

<P>
The three wastewater treatment plants put into operation, and
eight plants under construction have a combined capacity of

of the total discharged into the basin.

<P>
The province is also working on the plan to build seven other
wastewater treatment plants in counties.

<HEADLINE> Headway in Cleaning up China's Most Polluted River (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Headway has been made in
cleaning up China's most polluted river -- the Liaohe River -- by
cutting industrial pollution and building wastewater treatment
plants in the past four years, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the industrial wastewater discharged into the river
system, northeast China's Liaoning Province, the largest polluter
of the river, initiated a campaign last year to ensure that every
industrial polluter in the province meet the pollution discharge
standards set by local and central governments by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guoguang, governor of the province, signed letters of
responsibility in June of 1999, with mayors of eight industrial
cities, and the latter then signed similar documents with chief
district officials and directors of leading polluting firms in the
river valley.
</P>
<P>
The documents make it clear the executive responsibility of the
leading officials for reaching specific pollution control targets
in the coming years, namely, cutting excessive pollution discharge.
</P>
<P>
The provincial legislature issued in 1997 "The Regulation on
Controlling Water Pollution in the Liaoning Part of the Liaohe
Valley," providing a sound legal basis for local governments to
push forward the water pollution control program.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the province shut down 426 polluting
industrial firms, which are behind the times in terms of
technology and heavy consumers of raw material and energy in the
valley, and banned the use of 98 kinds of obsolete technology.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80 percent of the 6,145 firms in the valley met the
pollutant discharge standards by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Beginning last year, the province contributed 100 million yuan
to a fund to facilitate water pollution projects in the valley.
</P>
<P>
To raise the huge amount of money needed to build wastewater
treatment plants, the province levied 0.35 yuan on each ton of tap
water used across the province beginning in March.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: China's Plan to Clean up Most Polluted River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Much remains to be done in
cleaning up China's most polluted river Liaohe River in the
northeastern part of the country though a lot of work has been
done since 1997 when an ambitious program was launched.
</P>
<P>
Originating from the southeastern part of Inner Mongolia, the 1,
430 kilometer river also flows through south Jilin Province, and
the industrial belt of the Liaoning Province before it empties
itself in the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
The river is so polluted that it "becomes the drain for cities
and its water is of no use during low-water period" as it receives
little fresh rainwater from catch basins, according to a report by
the Liaoning Provincial People's Government.
</P>
<P>
The Liaoning part of the basin accounts for only 69,000 square
kilometers of the 164,000 square-kilometer basin, but the province
is the major polluter of the river as its eight industrial cities
discharge millions of tons of untreated industrial and domestic
wastewater into the river.
</P>
<P>
The river valley covers Shenyang, the largest industrial center
in northeast China, Anshan, Benxi, Yingkou, Liaoyang, Tieling,
Panjin and part of Jinzhou, Fuxin and Chaoyang, involving 20
million people, or half of the province's population.
</P>
<P>
The province produced 2.1 billion tons of wastewater last year,
ranking seventh in China's 30-plus provincial areas.
</P>
<P>
"The underground water along the trunk river and its
tributaries has been polluted to varying degrees, causing drinking
water problems for a number of areas and pollution of the province
's coastal waters", the report said.
</P>
<P>
What makes the matter worse is thousands of large industrial
polluters equipped with outdated machines and technology,
resulting in waste of energy and other materials and eventually
serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
For example, Yingkou Paper Mill, one of the top 10 of its kind
in China, was first built in 1936 with outdated machines while
Qingyang Chemical Company, a large firm producing chemicals for
military use, still uses technology and equipment first introduced
in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government decided in 1996 to list Liaohe as one
of the country's priority water pollution control targets and
approved a detailed pollution control program to clean up the
river by 2010.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the province plans to build 24
wastewater treatment plants, 118 projects to cut pollution
discharge by leading industrial firms and 28 ecological projects
costing 14.8 billion yuan (about 1.75 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
To date, the province has completed three urban wastewater
treatment plants with seven still more underway.
</P>
<P>
The 11 plants have a total designed capacity of handling 2.6
million tons per day, accounting for 70 percent of the total
wastewater discharged into the river valley.

<HEADLINE> 1st Lead: Last Three Malaysian Hostages Freed by Abu Sayyaf EDS -- Updates With Details, Background </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The last three Malaysian Hostages
were freed Sunday morning after being kept for four months in the
jungle lair of the Abu Sayyaf in the southern Philippine island of
Jolo.
</P>
<P>
The three Malaysians arrived in the southern city of Zamboanga,
some 150 kilometers northeast of Jolo, together with a special
envoy of Lee Peng Wee, a government negotiator working for the
release of the Malaysian hostages, the ABS-CBN TV station reported.
</P>
<P>
They were turned over to chief government negotiator Robert
Aventajado and Malaysian ambassador to the Philippines M.H. Ershad
at an air base in the city.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Abu Sayyaf has released all the nine Malaysians of
the 21 mostly foreign hostages it kidnapped from Malaysia's diving
resort of Sipadan on April 23. The nine are workers at the resort.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held at the air base, the
Malaysian ambassador extended thanks to the Philippine government
for its efforts in managing the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
He also conveyed to negotiators heartfelt gratitude from the
family members of the nine Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
It is very difficult to deal with the kidnappers, but the
Philippine negotiating team got substantive results, Ershad said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the three Malaysians were released Friday.
Negotiators said heavy rains and atrocious weather conditions had
hampered their release, preventing their transport from Jolo to
Zamboanga.
</P>
<P>
Ershad also expressed the hope that more hostages of the
Sipadan group will be released soon.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf rebels are still holding 10 hostages of the
Sipadan group -- two Germans, two French nationals, two Finns, two
South Africans, one Lebanese and one Filipino.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they have in their hands three French TV journalists
and 12 Filipino Christian evangelists who went to Jolo last month
to cover the hostage crisis and pray for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the Abu Sayyaf has released in batches nine
Malaysians, one ailing German woman and one Filipino of the
Sipadan group, and one German journalist and two local TV reports.
</P>
<P>
The rebels Saturday reneged on an agreement with government
negotiators to release all its hostages in one batch, alleging the
military is preparing an offensive against them.

<HEADLINE> Kidney Diseases on Rise in Nepal: Symposium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Kidney related ailments are on
the rise in Nepal where 1,000 patients afflicted with chronic
kidney diseases go to hospitals for treatment each year, the
official Rising Nepal said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kidney problems like nephritis, stones and kidney failures have
registered a sharp increase in Nepal in recent years, medical
experts were quoted as saying by the English daily.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly 10 to 15 percent of the hospital beds in Nepal have
kidney patients and roughly 1,000 patients with chronic kidney
failure visit hospitals every year," said senior medical
practitioner P.R. Satyal at a symposium convened Saturday to give
the update on nephrology and urology.
</P>
<P>
"This can largely be attributed to badly controlled diabetic
diseases, uncontrolled hypertension and environmental degradation,
" said Satyal.
</P>
<P>
Hepatitis and HIV/AIDS, unscrupulous use of analgesic drugs and
reckless use of toxic antibiotics are among the other major
factors that give rise to kidney disorders, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But there is no provision of kidney transplantation in the
country," Satyal said.
</P>
<P>
About 300 Nepali kidney patients go abroad, mainly to India for
kidney transplantation.
</P>
<P>
The medical experts at the symposium pointed out the pressing
need for competent doctors in Nepal, especially in rural areas
where 80 percent of its 22 million population live, and called on
the doctors in the country to concentrate in developing preventive
measures of kidney diseases.
</P>
<P>
About 20 doctors from India and Nepal attended the one-day
symposium to discuss new breakthroughs and constraints in the
field of nephro-urology. The symposium was organized by Siddhartha
Hospital Ltd, which is associated with The Apollo Hospitals Groups
of India, the largest hospital group in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Cross-Border Listing, Trade within SAARC Soon to State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The cross-border listing and trade
within the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
countries will begin as soon as possible, chairman of the South
Asian Federation of Exchanges (SAFE) was quoted Sunday by The
Independent as saying.
</P>
<P>
Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, the SAFE Chairman told a press
briefing Saturday in Chittagong, the largest port city in
Bangladesh, that cross-border listing and trade was the theme of
the third SAFE conference held in Karachi, Pakistan on August 10
and 11.
</P>
<P>
He listed the ingredients of the theme which included
regulatory compatibility, logistical linkages of facilities,
setting up a task force to look into the issues and identify
regulatory inconsistencies, constraints to capital movement and
recommendations on how to remove these constraints.
</P>
<P>
The Karachi conference decided to launch the SAFE Mutual Fund,
the first vehicle under preparation to cross-border investment,
Khasru said, adding that the proposed mutual fund will be managed
by an offshore Asset Management Company promoted by the SAFE.
</P>
<P>
The SAFE chief said the mutual fund is planned for the
investment of the citizens of all SAFE countries which will be
operated in all the member exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Being optimistic of the implementation of the SAFE Mutual Fund,
Khasru hoped the concept paper of the mutual fund would be
finalized very soon.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Pakistani Federal Minister for Finance and
Economic Affairs Shaukat Aziz had announced its commitment to be
the first candidate for cross-border listing among SAFE countries.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Statue of Dr. Bethune Unveiled in Hometown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada and China Saturday renewed
the memory of Dr. Norman Bethune, a great champion of
internationalism, as a bronze statue of him was unveiled in his
hometown Gravenhurst, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
Canadian General Governor Adrienne Clarkson said at a ceremony
attended by about 600 people that Dr. Bethune was "an
extraordinary person" with "an extraordinary way of having lived a
life."
</P>
<P>
"He didn't do what he did for recognition," she said. "
Everything he did, if you look at the evidence of his life, was
done because he felt it was the right thing to do."
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, a signed letter by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin was also read out. Jiang, extending his warm congratulations
on the unveiling of the statue, speaks highly of Dr. Bethune for
helping the Chinese people in their fight against Japanese
aggressors during World War II.
</P>
<P>
"He has become the symbol of the long-standing friendship
between our two peoples," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Mayor of Gravenhurst R. J. Betts praised Dr. Bethune as "a man
dedicated to life and living."
</P>
<P>
"He gave his life in China in the year 1939, in an effort to
save the life of just one more soldier, ... in the front lines of
just one more war," said the mayor.
</P>
<P>
"Today he is revered as a hero by hundreds of millions of
people, particularly in China where schoolchildren are still
taught of his selflessness and total dedication to his values,"
the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Foreman, who used to work in the same hospital in
Montreal where Dr. Bethune had worked, said that people in
Gravenhurst are happy to see more and more visitors coming to the
town every year to admire what Dr. Bethune did, adding that they
are proud of it.
</P>
<P>
The statue of Dr. Bethune has been erected as the town's
millennium project. The bronze statue is over 6.5 feet in height,
standing atop a massive native granite base.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to have some insight of what Bethune was thinking;
what motivated him, and what provided his inner energy, in order
that I sculpt him from the inside out, thus capturing his inner
spirit," said Muskoka artist Brenda Wainman Goulet, who sculpted
the bronze statue.
</P>
<P>
Born in Gravenhurst in 1890, Dr. Bethune went to Spain in 1936
in support of the fighting against fascism. He led a medical team
to China in 1937 to assist the Chinese people in their war against
Japanese aggressors.
</P>
<P>
He died of a poisonous blood infection in Wan Xian County,
Hebei Province, on November 12, 1939. On December 21, Mao Zedong,
the late Chinese leader, wrote the well-known article "In Memory
of Dr. Bethune."

</P>
<P>
The Movement for Free and fair Elections and Peoples Alliance
for Free and Fair Elections, which were involved in the election
monitoring process during last December presidential election,
have once again joined their hands for the task.
</P>
<P>
The two bodies are currently seeking two teams of international
observers from the United States and the European Union.
Negotiations are underway with a U.S. institute and they have
discussed the matter with the EU, officials said. In addition,
they plan to mobilize a total of 8,000 to 10,000 local volunteers
to serve as election observers in the polls.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga dissolved the
Parliament on Friday, six days before its expiry, and the general
elections are set to be held on October 10.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the ruling People's Alliance (PA)
will face strong challenge from the main opposition United
National Party (UNP). The popularity of PA is on decline due to
the rising cost of living as a result of recent devaluation of
rupee, the country's currency.
</P>
<P>
Setbacks of government forces on the battle fronts with
separatist Tamil Tiger rebels earlier this year and the failure in
government's efforts to push through the draft constitutions in
the Parliament also contribute to the declination.
</P>
<P>
After four months of tough negotiations between PA and UNP, the
two sides recently reached consensus on the draft constitution.
However, the government was forced to postpone indefinitely the
vote on the new constitution because it is far short of a broad
support needed from the general public, especially the dominant
Buddhists in the country.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Ancient Tomb Hit By Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A small part of the Beijing
Laoshan ancient tomb was once hit by a fire, according to
archaeologists at this morning's excavation site.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xin with the Beijing Research Institute of Cultural
Heritage noticed today some wood excavated has turned black,
showing the sign of a fire.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this discovery, archaeologists believed that the 2,000-
year-old tomb was not hit by any fire.
</P>
<P>
Dabaotai ancient tomb, the first imperial tomb dating back to
Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-24 A.D.) ever discovered in Beijing,
was found seriously burnt when archaeologists began excavating the
tomb in 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Both Laoshan and Dabaotai ancient tombs were all of wooden
structure. Wang Xin presumed that the fire was caused by ghouls
who entered the chamber of the tomb with torches. The fire died
out because of the thin air in the tomb.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder VI: China's Protestantism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Protestantism was introduced
into the Chinese mainland in the early 19th century. In the
following 100 years and following the Opium War in the early 1840s,
Western missionaries set up churches and preached the religion in
the interior areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1949 when the People's Republic of China was founded, the
number of Protestant believers in the nation was around 700,000 in
70 denominations, belonging to 121 foreign missionary societies.
</P>
<P>
In 1950, Chinese Protestants initiated the Three-Self (Self-
Administration, Self-Support, and Self-Propagation) Patriotic
Movement and began to run their religious affairs independently.
</P>
<P>
After the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), a political movement
that brought disaster to Chinese religious affairs, the Chinese
government again enforced the policy of freedom of religion. The
practice of Protestantism was thus restored and again flourished
in China.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are ten million Protestants, of which 18,000
are missionaries and staff, one-sixth of them are women, who work
in more than 12,000 churches and 25,000 meeting points.
</P>
<P>
There are 17 theological seminaries that have trained 3,000
graduates. To meet the demand of religious activities in rural
China, more than 50,000 lay Protestants have been trained to be
volunteers responsible for rural religious affairs.
</P>
<P>
China has two Protestant national organizations: The China
Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Protestant
Churches, and The China Christian Council. Leaders of the two
organizations are elected every five years.
</P>
<P>
These two organizations emphasize the publication of religious
books. The number of Bibles published has increased. By the first
half of 1998, more than 20 million copies of the Bible in the
Chinese, Miao, Korean, and Lisu languages, as well as in Braille,
had been printed and distributed throughout the country, in
addition to 8 million copies of the new edition of the Hymnal.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the two Chinese Christian national organizations have
edited and publishes devotional materials and reference books. The
monthly magazine Tianfeng (Heavenly Breeze) published by the two
organizations has a circulation of 130,000.
</P>
<P>
In February 1991, the China Christian Council joined the World
Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
The 102nd and 103rd archbishops of Canterbury, Dr. Billy Graham
of the United States, Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, and
many other international Christian leaders, both Protestant and
other, have visited China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Protestants have formed the China Peace Committee of
Religious Believers with people from other religions in the
country and attended peace conferences sponsored by churches in
Asia and conferences sponsored by churches all over the world in
an effort to promote peace for all mankind.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Blames U.S. for Boat Hijacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Cuba on Saturday blamed the
United States for the hijacking of a fishing boat last October by
a group of people, saying a U.S. law abets some Cubans in "
abandoning" the Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban Adjustment Act of the United States, which
automatically grants asylum to Cubans who set foot on U.S.
territory, encouraged the hijacking of a fishing boat on October 2
last year, said an article in the official Cuban newspaper Granma.
</P>
<P>
A group of 18 illegal emigrants hog-tied four of the sailors on
the boat during its trip from the Pinar del Rio province of Cuba
to Marqueas Key in Florida, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Nivaldo Castro, the skipper of the boat, organized the
hijacking and directed the boat to the northern coast of Pinar del
Rio, where his relatives and friends were waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
The four kidnapped sailors were returned on August 9 to the
island with a group of Cuban emigrants deported by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Granma described the incident as "another bitter fruit of the
assassin law," referring to the Cuban Adjustment Act.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1994 and 1995 immigration accords, 20,000 Cubans are
allowed to immigrate to the United States legally.
</P>
<P>
In line with those accords, Cubans trying to enter the United
States illegally who are intercepted at sea must be returned to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
But unlike other illegal immigrants, Cubans who manage to evade
the U.S. Coast Guard and reach U.S. shores are allowed to seek
legal residency and work permits under the so-called Cuban
Adjustment Act.

<HEADLINE> Australian Army Reservists to Thwart Olympics Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian Army reservists
Sunday conducted an exhaustive bomb search at Melbourne's National
League Soccer Stadium to cap off their anti-terrorist training for
next month's Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
About 500 reservists from the Army's 4th Brigade recently
completed a five-day bomb detection course, with several of those
putting their new skills into practice Sunday morning at the
soccer stadium, in Melbourne's outer north.
</P>
<P>
Already, about 200 reservists have arrived in Sydney to scour
Olympic venues, with most of the remainder to keep a close eye on
Melbourne venues, predominantly those used for soccer.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney contingent will remain on duty until the completion
of the Paralympic Games in November.
</P>
<P>
Fourth Brigade Commander Brigadier Douglas Ball said his
soldiers were working closely with police in the operation.
</P>
<P>
He described the bomb detection work as a great opportunity for
Army reservists to provide support for "one of the biggest
sporting spectacles of our lifetime".
</P>
<P>
"They will be looking for anything unusual that could disrupt
the games," Ball said.
</P>
<P>
The reservists will also check a city hotel where officials and
athletes will stay.

<HEADLINE> Australian FM: No Groups Pose Particular Threat at Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government had
taken all precautions to the Sydney Olympics but no particular
groups or nations had been identified as posing a threat, Foreign
Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"An enormous amount of work has been done on what the potential
threats might and might not be and to whom, but we don't have any
particular indications of there being a threat at the Olympics,"
Downer told the Seven TV Network.
</P>
<P>
"But we're not taking anything for granted," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously being extremely cautious and conservative in
the way we approach this issue and a large number of resources are
being dedicated to Olympic security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer ruled out allowing other nations to bring weapons into
Australia to protect their athletes.
</P>
<P>
"We've made it perfectly clear to all governments that might be
in any way interested in bringing weapons to Australia that here
in Australia we provide the security for the athletes and the
support for the teams and also for the VIPs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have people who are armed, we have people who are
sophisticated and well-trained to do that sort of work, and that
it isn't appropriate for foreign agents to bring weapons into
Australia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Downer said despite media speculation of some countries trying
to smuggle in weapons in diplomatic bags, the government had no
confirmation any actually would.
</P>
<P>
He said such activity would breach the Vienna Convention on
Diplomatic Relations.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think another country would consider doing that, I
really don't, not a government," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
He said security would particularly focus on teams from high-
risk countries such as Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel had not asked to bring weapons in, Downer said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists
discovered a corpse during the ongoing excavation of a 2,000-year-
old tomb in western part of Beijing here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The body was found in the front chamber, or the sitting room of
the occupant in the imaginary nether world. Most of the body's
skull and part of the arms have been unearthed. The body was laid
in the front chamber with the head southward.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists say that they estimated that it looks like a
male who looked around 35 years old and 161 cm tall at the time of
death, adding that it is yet difficult to determine the gender of
the corpse because it lay prone and its pelvis and skull cannot be
seen.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have not yet been able to identify who the dead
was and how long it has been there. They estimated it could be of
a ghoul, or a person buried with the occupant of the tomb, or the
occupant himself (herself) who was pulled by ghouls to the front
chamber from the rear chamber, known as a sleeping room.

<HEADLINE> Croatia to Reduce Import Tariffs on Agricultural Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Croatia will substantially reduce
its import tariffs on agricultural products beginning from this
autumn, since it has already joined the World Trade Organization (
WTO), a government official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The import tariffs on refined cooking oil will drop by 60
percent, veal and porket meat by 30 to 40 percent, beef from 65 to
29 percent, and pork from 55 to 35 percent, Croatian Radio and
Television quoted Tomislav Ledic, a deputy minister of agriculture
and forestry, as saying.
</P>
<P>
While some strategic agricultural products such as wheat,
cooking oil, sugar and dairy will still enjoy government subsidies,
farmers on the whole will be left to sink or swim in the market,
said Ledic.
</P>
<P>
Domestic consumers, however, will benefit from the dropped
prices of farm produce, Ledic noted.
</P>
<P>
The General Council of the WTO ratified Croatia as its 137th
member on July 17.

MEXICO CITY, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Mexican president-elect
Vicente Fox Saturday proposed that the United States and Canada
create a "subsidiary fund" with contributions of 10 billion to 25
billion U.S. dollars to counteract development differences and to
deal with problems like drug trafficking and illegal migration.
</P>
<P>
Fox, who will visit the two countries on August 22-25, told a
press conference that the fund could also finance projects of
health, employment and education, and would be aimed at the
poorest areas.
</P>
<P>
It is a priority for the next Mexican president, who will
assume office on December 1, to advance social and development
projects to fight emigration, one of the most serious problems in
Mexico-U.S. relations, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Fox said he would not come up with any formal proposal during
his visit, as he is not the head of the government yet, although
he would take the gauge of the future of the North American Free
Trade Agreement between the three countries, which was in force
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The visit will be his second overseas tour since he won the
July 2 election. He had visited Chile, Argentina and Brazil early

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder V: Catholicism in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The teachings of the Catholic
Church were first brought into China during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-
1368), but they were not widely disseminated until the Italian
missionary Matteo Ricci (1552-1610) came in 1582, the tenth year
of the reign of Emperor Wanli of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
The arrival of Matteo Ricci is generally considered the
official introduction of Catholicism into China.
</P>
<P>
Before the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
China's Catholicism was controlled by dozens of missions in more
than ten countries, and the Chinese clergymen had no rights. Of
the 137 parishes in the country, only 29 were managed by Chinese
bishops. At that time, there were about three million Catholics in
China.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, a number of Chinese Catholics of insight
examined the history of Catholicism and initiated a patriotic
movement, pushing the Chinese Catholic Churches on the road of
administrating the religion by the Chinese Catholics themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Catholic Churches now has 115 parishes, 70 bishops,
1,100 priests, 1,200 nuns, and over four million lay followers.
China has established two national Catholic organizations: The
Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, formed in 1957 in Beijing,
with Bishop Fu Tieshan as the current president; and the Chinese
Catholic Bishops Conference, founded in 1980 in Beijing, with
Bishop Liu Yuanren as the president.
</P>
<P>
Under Bishop Liu's jurisdiction are a theological research
center and five special committees responsible for teaching,
theological seminaries, rituals, liaison with foreign religious
organizations, and social services.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Fertilizer Production Up in 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced 138,615 tons of
chemical fertilizer in fiscal year 1999-2000, which ended in March,
up 6 percent compared with the previous fiscal year, according to
the latest figures of the country's Central Statistical
Organization (CSO).
</P>
<P>
During the last five fiscal years, Myanmar's fertilizer output
was the highest in 1995-96 with 142,779 tons. It was dropped to
117,201 tons in 1996-97 and was picked up in the years followed
until 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
The country has only three fertilizer plants, producing
annually a total of about 130,000 tons of urea.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is said to need over 800,000 tons of chemical
fertilizer annually.
</P>
<P>
According to the CSO, the country has still to spend 34.7
million U.S. dollars of foreign exchange annually, importing
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer, along with pesticide, improved variety and
machinery, is among agricultural implements on which import duties
are exempted by the government as part of its bid to promote
agricultural development.

GUATEMALA CITY, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala and Belize will
form on August 28 a joint commission to boost mutual confidence
and finally resolve their territorial dispute, said the Guatemalan
Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The commission is made up of five representatives from each
country. The Guatemalan side has announced all five members, while
Belize has named four, according to a communique of the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the joint commission is one of the three
agreements reached at the meeting held July 17-20 at the
Organization of American States (OAS) headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The other two agreements refer to the appointment of a
conciliator for each country and to the rapprochement of the two
armies.
</P>
<P>
United States lawyer Paul Reichler, the conciliator for
Guatemala, and his Belize counterpart, a Guyana citizen Shridath
Ramphal, plan to meet on August 31.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan Defense Minister Juan de Dios Estrada and his
Belizean counterpart, Jorge Espat, met last weekend at Cayo
Ambergris, Belize, and agreed on a series of measures to improve
relations.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala claims that Britain mistakenly awarded some 12,000
square kilometers of its territory to Belize when Belize obtained
independence from Britain in 1981.

<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres
Pastrana announced Saturday that Colombia will seek generalized
customs tariff preferences for its exports to the United States to
strengthen its economy and fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"What we want, more than assistance with money, is customs
tariff preferences," Pastrana told the local radio network RCN.
</P>
<P>
Exports went up 20 percent during the first half of the year,
boosted by higher oil prices. Oil revenues represent more than a
third of the targeted 13 billion dollars from the sale of
Colombian goods abroad this year.
</P>
<P>
The rise in exports has stimulated a mild revival of the
economy, which grew 2.2 percent during the first half of the year,
according to estimates by the Bank of the Republic. The country's
GDP dropped by 4.5 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Agassi and Corretja Sail into ATP Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Reigning US Open champion
Andre Agassi and second seed Alex Corretja of Spain beat their
rivals respectively Saturday to enter the final of the 800,000-
dollar ATP Washington Classic.
</P>
<P>
Agassi won over the 60th-ranked David Prinosil of Germany 6-1,
6-3 in 70 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The top seed and two-time defending champion plays for his
sixth Washington title in 11 years on Sunday against Corretja, who
ousted third seed Nicolas Kiefer of Germany 7-6 (7/2), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Agassi is 4-2 lifetime against Corretja but has lost their
past two matches -- in the 1998 Indianapolis final and 1998 ATP
World Championship, when Agassi retired with an injury and
Corretja went on to capture the crown.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, fifth in the ATP Champions Race, has won no event more
often in his career than this one. The 30-year-old American has a
19-1 Washington record in the past five years and has won 14
matches in a row here without losing a set.

titles so far this season.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten, who said that he wasn't so keen on playing "early in
the morning," eventually found his form in the match which began
at noon.
</P>
<P>
He methodically took control of the first set and finally the
match against Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
The victory means Kuerten will play the winner of a night
match between seventh seed Tim Henman of Britain and Number three
Russian Marat Safin.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten lost the final at the Masters Series event in Miami in
March to Pete Sampras and played a hard-court final in Toronto in
1997. Kuerten, 23, now 45-14 this season with three titles from
five finals.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wrestling Olympic Selections Marred by Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- As the Olympic Games is less
than one month away, the U.S. Wrestling was plunged into the chaos
away from the mats by a string of protests concerning its Olympic
selections.
</P>
<P>
Matt Lindland, four-time national champion, filed two protests
after he lost the Olympic trials to Keith Sieracki for the 76kg
Greco-Roman berth.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Sieracki was filing for his own arbitration after
Lindland won the rematch 8-0.
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a mess," said Jim Scherr, executive director
of USA Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
Sieracki, who won the trials on a referee's decision in
overtime, claimed that he was told the rematch was just practice
and that the Olympic berth still belongs to him.
</P>
<P>
Now another arbitrator will consider the issue on Wednesday, 24
hours before USA Wrestling must submit its roster for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"It gives the sport a black eye to have all these protests, I'm
not so sure an athlete should be able to protest a decision when
he loses, then to send it to arbitration," said Sonny Greenhalgh,
chairman of the New York Athletic Club's wrestling program.
</P>
<P>
Lindland claimed Sieracki used his legs in their original match,
a no-no in Greco-Roman wrestling, and that the referee missed the
infraction, even though his own coach accepted the referee's
decision.
</P>
<P>
Greenhalgh has three athletes heading for Sydney, among them
are Kevin Bracken and Charles Burton who made the team after
protests forced rematches.
</P>
<P>
Bracken, a two-time national champion, had his first victory
over Glenn Nieradka overturned by a protest and then beat his
opponent again to qualify for the 63kg Greco-Roman category.
</P>
<P>
Burton won his trials match in June for the 85kg freestyle
class, but a rematch was ordered because his opponent Lee Fullhart
was injured. Burton then won the rematch a month later.

<HEADLINE> One Person Killed in Chaos in Kenyan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- One person died and another six
seriously injured in daylong chaos and violence in the downtown of
Kenya's capital Nairobi Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Daily Nation newspaper reported that youths barricaded
parliament buildings in an attempt to keep some 10 members of the
parliament (MP) off a rally at Kamukunji grounds in the capital
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The youths also sealed off the venue of the meeting which the
police canceled, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
This was moments after MPs Mukhisa Kituyi, Anyang' Nyong'o and
Waithaka Mwangi arrived at the venue to plead with the Buruburu
police boss, Nemwel Mochache to allow the meeting.
</P>
<P>
But Mochache stood his ground, saying he had orders to cancel
the rally. The MPs dismissed him, saying the police did not notify
the convener.
</P>
<P>
It was then that a group of youths arrived, urging that the
meeting be allowed to take place. But the police responded by
charging at them with clubs and teargas as the crowd scampered in
different directions.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitness said, the dead, Kariki Meangi, was dragged behind
the kiosk where he was clobbered senseless. He died on the way to
hospital and his body was taken to City Mortuary.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the youths, chanting National Development
Party and Kanu (the ruling party) slogans, tried to disperse
people who had gathered for the rally. They also took control of
all the three entrances to the parliament buildings and the
adjoining streets.
</P>
<P>
The crowd that had gathered for the meeting fought pitched
battle with the youths and repulsed them at around noon. The
grounds hit fever-pitch at 1:20 p.m. when anti-riot police charged
at the crowd which had pitched camp.
</P>
<P>
Daily Nation newspapers reported the police had in fact
withdrawn from the scene, only to come back firing rubber bullets,
lobbing tear-gas canisters and triggering a stampede.
</P>
<P>
Buruburu police chief, Mochache, later told journalists that
they dispersed the crowd so as to avert a bloody confrontation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Company Wins First Drilling Contract in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC) on Sunday won its first contract of 85 million
U.S. dollars to drill 19 gas wells in southern Iran.
</P>
<P>
The drilling project was the first of its kind put on
international tender by the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) and
the first one won by a Chinese company since the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, a consortium formed by two affiliated
companies of the CNPC, China Petroleum Technology Service LTD
(CPTS) and China Petroleum Technology Development Company (CPTDC),
and Iran's Mostazafan and Janbazan (the Oppressed and Disabled)
Foundation will carry out the project in a time span of two years.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC will provide necessary technology and equipment to help
the NIOC to drill the wells with an aim to boost Iran's gas
production. The project was estimated to have a daily output of 860
million cubic feet (about 24.08 million cubic meters).
</P>
<P>
Iran holds 15.7 percent of the world gas reserves, or over 22
trillion cubic meters, but it only produces 2.3 percent of the
global gas output.

<HEADLINE> SADC Wants U.N. Mandate Extended in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) wanted the mandate of the United
Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to be
extended at the end of the month, South African Foreign Minister
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zuma, however, did not indicate whether she was in favor of
another six month extension or a shorter period, as proposed by U.
N. Secretary-general Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mandate ends on August 31 and the U.N. Security
Council will meet on Thursday to discuss whether it should be
extended.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters in Johannesburg, Zuma said the honoring of
the year-long Lusaka peace accord was the most appropriate
mechanism to bring peace to the DRC, saying that  the SADC wanted
to assist in its implementation.
</P>
<P>
Last week Annan called on the U.N. to rethink its role in the
DRC after talks between DRC President Laurent Kabila and regional
leaders in Lusaka failed to kick-start the accord.
</P>
<P>
Annan recommended that the U.N. mandate be extended for only
one month when it expires on August 31, instead of the usual six
months.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. also named former Nigerian president Abdulsalami
Abubakar as its special envoy to tackle the mounting obstacles to
the U.N. force in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council had already given authority for 5,500 U.N.
troops to monitor the DRC ceasefire agreement signed in Lusaka in
July last year, but so far only about 230 military observers had
been deployed.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Resettle Residents in Congested Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Lusaka Provincial
Minister Sony Mulenga said that the current residential areas in
Lusaka are congested and the government should find new areas for
residential houses, Zambia Daily Mail reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga was quoted by the paper as saying on Sunday that the
government will repossess land which has not been developed by
owners and give it to the people who are in dire need of it.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga told district leaders to identify land lying idle and
give it to locals who have the capacity to develop it.
</P>
<P>
The minister prodded members of the country's ruling party not
to fall prey to claims by opposition parties that they will
improve the welfare of Zambians when in fact they have no capacity
to even formulate a manifesto.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga said that the freedom and peace they enjoy do not come
naturally but through the government efforts and should therefore
be properly guarded.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Listed as Leading Buyer of Tanzanian Exports in COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has been a leading
buyer of Tanzanian exports over the past three years in the COMESA
regional market, which Tanzania is going to quit next month, the
independent Guardian newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's total exports to Kenya have amounted to over 74.8
million U.S. dollars since 1997, according to a study on the
effects and consequences of Tanzania's withdrawal from the COMESA,
carried out by the Tanzania Chamber of Commerce, Industry and
Agriculture (TCCIA).
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe was ranked second with 32.6 million dollars, followed
by Malawi, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the report shows Tanzania's exports to Kenya declined
from 28.2 million dollars in 1998 to 21.2 million dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
The study founds that Tanzania maintains substantial trade
relations with COMESA countries, citing about 53 million dollars
worth of exports made in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1994, COMESA has 22 member states in East and
Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Recently, TCCIA opposed the government's decision to pull out
of COMESA, saying the move will neither benefit business community
nor the government.
</P>
<P>
It will create negative economic and business conditions that
will eventually lead to loss to business, said the chamber.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government has set September 2 as the official
date to withdraw from the regional trade bloc as it wants to "
concentrate on smaller economic blocs such as the East African
Cooperation and Southern Africa Development Community."

<HEADLINE> Rubber Production Study Starts in COMESA Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) and the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) have commissioned a study to assess rubber growing
potential in Zambia and three other countries in the region, Times
of Zambia newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted COMESA assistant secretary general Sindiso Ngwenya as
saying in an interview here at the weekend that the study which
began recently, was led by a Malaysian rubber expert who provided
expertise to the technical team.
</P>
<P>
Ngwenya said the team had looked at rubber growing potential
particularly in Zambia's Luapula Province where a number of
independent studies had already been carried out by both the
government and the private sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said the aim of the study was to assess potential of the
selected countries to make the region self sufficient in rubber
production and reduce imports from outside the COMESA region.
</P>
<P>
"The study is on and we are looking at those countries which
have natural conditions for rubber growing so that such projects
can be encouraged," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Luapula project was seen to be economically viable
as it already had a number of rubber trees growing in the area.
</P>
<P>
The 1,500 rubber trees were planted by a consortium of
companies, he said. He also named some of the selected countries
as Uganda, Ethiopia and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He challenged the private sector in the selected countries to
invest and develop the projects to reduce costs involved in the
importation of furnished rubber products.
</P>
<P>
Ngwenya said with the coming of the Free Trade Area (FTA) there
was need for the region to develop strategic industries that would
reduce heavy dependency on imports.

Many victims were caught unaware and were burnt in their beds
as they tried to escape, and the dead people were burned beyond
recognition.
</P>
<P>
The train accident is the second in a week in the country. Last
Tuesday, 13 people died and over 40 others were injured when a
commuter trains derailed in western Kenya.

Railways management to ensure safety in their operations and sent

<HEADLINE> S. African Leaders Express Sorrow at Death of Prominent Industrialist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from across the
political spectrum in South Africa paid tribute on Sunday to
former Anglo American and De Beers chairman Harry Oppenheimer, 91,
who died on Saturday evening after a short illness.
</P>
<P>
Homage was paid to Oppenheimer's immense contributions to the
political and economic development of South Africa when he served
as chairman of Anglo American, the biggest gold producer in the
world, for 25 years, and was at the helm of De Beers Consolidated
Mines, the world's biggest diamond producer, for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
At the request of his family, information about his death was
withheld from the media until Sunday so that family members could
be advised beforehand, according to the Business Day newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Former South African president Nelson Mandela on Sunday
expressed sorrow at the death of Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
"We extend our most sincere personal condolences" to the death
of Oppenheimer, he said.
</P>
<P>
"His support for democratic and philanthropic causes was in my
experience always without hesitation and reserve. His contribution
to building partnership between big business and the new
democratic government in that first period of democratic rule can
never be appreciated too much," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
South African President Thabo Mbeki described Oppenheimer as "
ever the gentleman and a man of deep conviction and compassion"
and praised him for the work he bequeathed to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said it was a little known fact that Oppenheimer was one
of the pioneers of reconciliation in this country.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress (ANC) described Oppenheimer as
one of South Africa's "outstanding businessmen" and acknowledged
his and Anglo's contribution in building the economy of the
country. The ANC called on his business colleagues to continue
with his good work.
</P>
<P>
Oppenheimer took over the family's interests in Anglo American
and De Beers in 1957, building them to become among the world's
foremost mining and industrial corporations. He was considered to
be among the 10 richest men in the world.
</P>
<P>
His death followed a brief illness that began on Wednesday
evening when Oppenheimer complained of stomach pains shortly after
a dinner at his home.

ARTA, Djibouti, August 20 (Xinhua) -- August 20, 2000 is a date
that will absolutely be written in the history of Somalia as it
witnessed the election of parliament speaker, the first of its
kind since 1991.
</P>
<P>
It was near the midnight. The small town of Arta, some 45 km
away from the capital of Djibouti, remained reluctant to be quiet.
</P>
<P>
Inside a huge plastic marquee built in the middle of a drill
ground, lights were glaring while 175 members of the Somali
transitional Parliament were voting one by one.
</P>
<P>
All the voters worn the sky-blue sash decorated with the white
five-pointed star, a significant design of Somali national flag.
</P>
<P>
"We actually lost our national flag because of a 10-year civil
war," a woman participant said, referring the on-going separation
of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"Now we want everybody to see that our national flag is back,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
This is indeed a late legislative election for the Somalis,
which should have taken place many years ago.
</P>
<P>
"But as the saying goes, it is better late than never," said
another delegate from Puntland, northeast Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Voting started at last. The first voter, Amina Ali Musa, was a
27-year-old woman from Issaq clan of north Somalia. Wearing
beautiful traditional Somali dress, Amina said she was extremely
excited to be the first voter in the speaker election.
</P>
<P>
"This is a real voting since we are trying to be united. We are
glad to have reached a right point after 10 years of civil war,"
she said.
