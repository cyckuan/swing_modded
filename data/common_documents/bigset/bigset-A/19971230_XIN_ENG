<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Sending Envoy to Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The White House on Monday
denied a report that the Clinton administration had sent a special
envoy to Tehran looking possible changes in Iranian foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
"We have no plans to send a special envoy to Tehran at all,"
White House spokesman Eric Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The report came from the official news agency of the United
Arab Emirates, which said in a Washington-datelined dispatch that
President Bill Clinton had sent Tom Lantos, a Congressman of
California Democrat, to Tehran in an effort to find any evidence
for the changes of Iranian foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the reported visit by Lantos was "news to us."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Latos' office at the Capitol Hill made no
immediate answer to any call asking the Congressman's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States was looking for "deeds not words"
to confirm any changes in Iranian foreign policy since Mohammad
Khatami was elected the Iranian president in the May elections.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed his hope to restore dialogue with the United
States at a news conference in Tehran on Dec. 14 and Clinton
responded two days later with a positive tone for that proposal.
</P>
<P>
"I think it was sa tragic that the United States was separated
from the people of Iran," Clinton said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed the U.S. position for the possible dialogue,
saying three issues should be discussed before any dialogue could
be considered.
</P>
<P>
The three allegations include: Iran's support and funding for
terrorism, opposition to the U.S.-sponsored Middle East peace
process and its development of weapons of mass destruction, all
of which the Iranian government has flatly denied.

<HEADLINE> British Women at Work Now Outnumber Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) - British women outnumber men in
the workplace for the first time in peacetime history, official
figures show.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal there
are 12000 more women than men in paid employment. There are a
total of 11248000 women in work compared to 11236000 men.
</P>
<P>
Partly as a result of this increase, the Government is ready to
launch a campaign to persuade employers to become more "family
friendly".
</P>
<P>
It is reported that companies have not changed their practices
enough to reflect the huge expansion in the number of women in the
workforce.
</P>
<P>
A committee of eight ministers chaired by Home Secretary Jack
Straw is drawing up proposals to make life at work easier for
women.
</P>
<P>
It urges firms to provide creches and nursery vouchers and make
it easier for parents to job-share and work part-time.
</P>
<P>
A report published today by the Policy Studies Institute claims
that women are still being discriminated against in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
It says they receive less pay and training than men, and that
employers are less likely to use women's experience.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Pledges Not to Resume Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cape Town, December 29 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela reiterated today that his government would
establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of
China in late 1997 and never resume official ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qichen here, Mandela said diplomatic ties
between South Africa and Taiwan would never be resumed after the
normalization of Pretoria-Beijing relations due to be realized as
of January 1.
</P>
<P>
Mandela announced in November last year that his government
would sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan and establish
comprehensive relations with the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the reason of setting up diplomatic relations
with China, Mandela said that China, a permanent member in the
United Nations Security Council, is one of the most populous
states in the world where economy is developing very fast.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interest of South Africa to have diplomatic ties
with the People's Republic of China," Mandela noted, adding his
government will uphold "one-China policy".
</P>
<P>
In response, Qian firstly relay greetings from Chinese
President Jiang Zemin who invited Mandela to visit China at his
convenience while Mandela also asked Qian to convey his best
regards to Jiang and invited him to visit South Africa as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Qian said the forthcoming
normalization of Sino-South African relations is not only a big
event in the history of the two countries, but also conducive to
world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The peoples of the two countries will be very happy about
this, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that there is great potentiality in economic
exchange and trade between China and South Africa, saying that
China is willing to make positive contribution to the development
of South African economy.
</P>
<P>
Qian arrived in South Africa Sunday for a five-day official
visit at the invitation of his South African counterpart Alfred
Nzo. The two ministers will meet Tuesday over bilateral relations
and sign a joint communique on the establishment of official
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian will attend the opening ceremony of the Chinese embassy
in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his meeting with Mandela, Qian also had friendly
talks with Premier of Gauteng Province Tokyo Sexwale, with the
two sides pledging to continue promoting cooperation in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Qian's visit are his wife Zhou Hanqiong, Deputy
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng
and Assistant Foreign Minister Ji Peiding.

<HEADLINE> 609 Killed on S. African Roads in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of 609 people
have been killed in traffic accidents this month, South African
traffic authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
This was nearly half the road deaths between December 3, 1996
and January 12, 1997, the "Arrive Alive" campaign was quoted by
South African Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
Six people died this morning in a head-on collision between a
bus and a mini-bus taxi near Carltonville, which is 75 kilometers
southwest of Johannesburg, the campaign said.
</P>
<P>
The taxi was burnt out and all its occupants were killed,
while no one in the bus was injured, it said.
</P>
<P>
The top three provinces on this month's road death toll list
are Eastern Cape, at 109, Kwazulu-Natal, where Durban seaport is
located, at 106, and Gauteng, centered around Pretoria and
Johannesburg, at 98.
</P>
<P>
The campaign attributed the accidents mainly to speeding,
driver fatigue and pedestrian jaywalking.
</P>
<P>
Traffic volumes on most of the country's major roads were
normal today, but were expected to pick up from Friday, when most
people return from their holidays, the campaign said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign's traffic information center said today that law
enforcement would be tightened on roads nationwide around New
Year's Day, including setting up road blocks testing drinking and
seat-belt using.
</P>
<P>
"In particular there will be numerous road blocks testing for
motorists driving under the influence of alcohol from December
31, 1997 to January 1, 1998," the center said, warning that road
offenders would stand a high probability of being prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Gauteng, Kwazulu-Natal and the Western Cape would be targeted
because three quarters of road accidents and 53 percent of
fatalities were recorded there.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria To Remove Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Starting from January 1, 1998,
Bulgaria will implement a new policy to remove trade barriers by
encouraging exports of Bulgarian products and imports of foreign
products with high added-value.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Bulgarian Minister of Trade and Tourism
Valentin Vasilev Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the new policy will exempt types of
agricultural machineries, mining machineries, coal, and cultural
items such as musical instruments and movies from import
taxes. The import tax on vegetable oil will be reduced 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
To encourage export, he said, agricultural products such as
grains and feeds will become tax free, and taxes on 26 types of
important materials including livestocks and timber will be cut by
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Vasilev added the new policy was made in line with the
requirements of the European Union, World Trade Organization,
International Monetary Fund, and World Bank, so as to help open
Bulgaria, a country with formidable trade barriers.

WASHINGTON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 passengers
aboard a United Airlines jumbo jet were injured and one was killed

late Sunday.

<HEADLINE> CBI Warns Firms to Act Fast on Millennium Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) - Organizations which fail to take
action to change their computers to cope with the millennium
"time-bomb" risk going out of business, the Confederation of
British Industry (CBI) warned today.
</P>
<P>
Adair Turner, CBI's director-general, said awareness of the
date change problem had increased dramatically, but warned there
was a "dangerous reluctance" among firms to convert that concern
into action to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
"While there are 732 days still to go to the millennium, the
final year must be used for preparation and testing. Firms need to
use next year to ensure they are compliant," he said.
</P>
<P>
The end of the century could create an international computer
meltdown. At midnight on the last day of 1999, when the year rolls
over to 2000, any computerized system which processes year dates
with only two digits will interpret the year 2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
The "millennium time-bomb" could affect almost every aspect of
daily life, including using credit cards, the payment of wages and
salaries and the provision of health services in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said many companies are reluctant to take action
despite the growing realization that the date change will affect
every company in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is simple and so is the solution. Failure to
implement it will cause major problems for British business," said
Turner.

BUCHAREST, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Parliament
Monday approved the appointment of Andrei Plesu as foreign
minister of the country.
</P>
<P>
Plesu, 49, was nominated last Tuesday when his predecessor
Andrian Severin was forced to resign because of his unsupported
allegations that some heads of the nation's political parties and
newspapers were spys of foreign counties.
</P>
<P>
After accepting the nomination by Severin's Democratic
Party, a procedure agreed upon by the ruling parties, Plesu
said he would remain independent in the foreign minister's office.
</P>
<P>
Plesu was Cultural Minister in the first Romanian government
after the political changes in 1989 and stepped down at the end of
1991 to teach philosophy in the Bucharest University.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Elections Prolonged for at Least Another </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's general elections
dued to end today are to be prolonged for at least another day
following a general delay in the opening of the polling stations
across the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Commission has decided to extend polling in the affected
areas to 6:00 p.m. on 30th, December, 1997," said a statement
signed by Electoral Commission (EC) Chairman Samuel Kivuitu.
</P>
<P>
The statement said freak weather conditions in many parts of
the country and lateness in opening stations due to logistic
problems are key reasons behind the decision.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile there will be no counting of votes anywhere in the
country" until all the voting ends Tuesday, according to the
statement, which urges the police to continue "to keep maximum
security" during the polling period.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, EC Public Relations Officer Mahamed Koor told Xinhua
that the delay is common in the country mainly because of the
preparation of ballot papers and transport of 27,000 monitors to
a total of 12,754 polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10 million registered Kenyan voters today queued up
orderly and peacefully to cast their ballots in Kenya's second
multi-party elections to choose the fittest person who will lead
this eastern African country into the next century.
</P>
<P>
All polling stations in the country were due to open at 6:00
a.m. for 12 hours. However, a lot of people complained about the
delay caused by the late-opening.
</P>
<P>
The polling station located in Highridge Primary School,
Westlands in Nairobi, saw the first vote cast there at 10:45 a.m.
although many voters arrived there four or five hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
Charity Ngilu, presidential hopeful for Social Democratic
Party, who cast her ballot in Kitui, Eastern Province, around
8:00 o'clock after waiting for over 90 minutes, also complained
about the postponement, said a report from the Kenya Television
Network (KTN).
</P>
<P>
"The Electoral Commission is ill-prepared," she said. Ngilu
who was listed the third in most opinion polls before the
elections, is one of the first two women in Kenya to vie for the
top seat.
</P>
<P>
Three flood-hit constituencies in Garissa, North-Eastern
Province, missed today's elections due to lack of transport for
officers and ballot papers, according to a latest report from the
KTN.
</P>
<P>
A total of 9,031,141 registered voters are expected to cast
their ballots to elect one president, 210 parliamentary members
and 2,955 local councillors.
</P>
<P>
Under Kenya's law, the winning presidential candidate must
garner the highest total and collect at least 25 percent of the
votes in at least five of the country's eight provinces.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls before today's elections show that President
Daniel arap Moi, 73 and in power for 19 years, would head the
poll with votes ranging from 40.2 percent to 49.2 percent, almost
doubling his closest challenger Mwai Kibaki, chairman of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
But most people interviewed with Xinhua here today, which
include dozens of rich people of Asian origin, said they want a
change in the leadership, citing corruption, economic slump, poor
infrastructure, administration of low efficiency as key reasons.
</P>
<P>
Presidential candidate Setphen Omondi Oludhe, leader of the
tiny Economic Independence Party, announced his withdrawal Sunday
at the last minute, saying that he will support Moi, thus putting
the runners for the country's most crowded presidential race at
14.
</P>
<P>
A total of 883 candidates from 23 parties are running for
parliamentary seats while 8,446 vying for civic elections.

MOSCOW, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkmen President Saparmurad
Niyazov and Iranian President Sayed Mohammad Khatami today took
part in a ceremony in Ashgabat on the occasion of opening the
natural gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Iran, the Interfax news
agency reported from Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
The natural gas pipeline from Korpedzhe in Turkmenistan to Kord
Kuy in northern Iran began operating Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 200-kilometer pipeline beginning in 1998 will deliver about
4 billion cubic meters of Turkmen gas to Iran, rising to about 8
billion cubic meters by 2006, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has guaranteed to purchase Turkmen gas for the next 25
years.
</P>
<P>
This pipeline is seen as a segment of a wider project to build
a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Europe via Iran and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday a tripartite agreement between Turkmenistan, turkey
and Iran on the construction of the gas pipeline was signed by
their state ministers in Ashgabat.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Send More Pilgrims to Perform Hajj </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraq decided today to triple
the number of its pilgrims to Mecca, Saudi Arabia for the next
season, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,000 Iraqis will be allowed to perform hajj as of
March next year, compared to 1,000 this year. The decision was
made at the 43rd session of Iraqi cabinet chaired by President
Saddam Hussein, INA said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting also sanctioned contacts with certain Arab
countries intended to recover their overdue debts to Iraq, in
order to meet the expenses needed for the upcoming pilgrimage,
INA said. It did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting also ordered the go-ahead of a motion with
the United Nations demanding that allocations be set aside for the
hajj from Iraqi oil proceeds under the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The deal between Iraq and the U.N. permits Baghdad to export 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian goods.

<HEADLINE> Britain Regrets Suspension of Contacts by Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain today expressed regret
over Turkish Cypriots' decision to suspend contacts with the
government of Cyprus controlled by Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
"we regret the decision to suspend bicommunal activity but we
very much hope that it will resume," a spokesman of the British
High Commission said here today.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the British High Commissioner to Cyprus David
Madden has to cancel a dinner party scheduled for Tuesday for 60
businessmen of the two sides, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that Madden is due to meet Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash later this week, during which he will raise the issue of
bicommunal contacts.
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain views such activity as positive and
constructive because it helps the two communities to understand
each other.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots controlling the northern third of Cyprus
Saturday decided to suspend most bicommunal activities, bilateral
peace talks and activities sponsored by foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The move is in response to the decision of this month by the
European Union to start accession talks with Cyprus next March,
but exclude Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Both the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, which insist that Cyprus
can not join the EU until a solution is formulated to the Cyprus
problem, are opposed to EU's decision.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the mediterranean
island after a failed pro-Athens coup by the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and a number of countries have been making
efforts to help reunify the island in a bizonal, bicommunal
federation. But so far little tangible results have been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> Floods Continue to Wreck Havoc in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The floods that devastated
southern Somalia are now playing havoc with the air traffic too.
</P>
<P>
The only tarmac road linking the capital Mogadishu with the
main airport of Ballidogle has been cut off by floods from the
Shabelle river, forcing a large number of local airlines to
suspend their routine operations.
</P>
<P>
The tarmac road is currently cut off near the district of
Wanlewein, 90 km southwest of Mogadishu, where a large bus TATA
was submerged in the middle of a large hole created by the strong
waters that gathered after the Shabelle river burst its banks in
the central part of the river and Hiran regions.
</P>
<P>
The companies who used the large planes are now hiring small
Cesna planes to land either at Km-50 or Issaley airstrips in an
effort to continue with some of their businesses. Other planes
changed their route to Nairobi where passengers can hire other
planes which can land at the gravel airstrips, north or south of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
All buses, lorries, trailers and the four-wheel-drive battle
wagons leaving for the southwestern regions stopped at the end of
the road where it is cut. Then a small home-made boat and porters
moved the people aboard the boat along with their goods across
the water.
</P>
<P>
This new business has been introduced after everything came to
a standstill for about 24 hours and now the people and their
goods are charged with a sum varying from less than one U.S.
Dollar to three Dollars to cross the water which stretches more
than 100 meters wide.
</P>
<P>
The floods have damaged villages and farms in Lower Shabelle
region. However, according to travellers, some of the displaced
people are now relieved a bit by feeding on fish and they were
seen fishing in the waters and catching many fish easily without
hooks or strings.
</P>
<P>
Some are using sharpened sticks and their clothes to catch
fish. Although the religion permits Somalis to eat fish, not many
of them go for fishing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the only bridge of Jalalaqsi district, 150 km north
of the capital, went down last night. Ibrahim Abdi Amey, deputy
district commissioner, said the bridge suddenly broke down after
two tractors passed it a little after midnight.
</P>
<P>
Amey told Xinhua through the VHF radio in Jalalaqsi town that
people in the town had to walk around for more than 20 km to
reach the other side of the same town. He noted that the town is
suffering from a new kind of disease which has claimed nine lives
in the past three days.
</P>
<P>
"A patient would complain about headache, then catches very
high fever, then blood comes out of the nostrils followed by
vomit and he or she passes away in less than 24 hours," Amey
said, adding, "The last one who died of the disease was an old
man who was buried this morning."
</P>
<P>
This mysterious disease has also been reported in the village
of Torotorow, 115 km southwest of Mogadishu, where more than 42
people have died.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the International Committee of Red Cross,
Somali Red Crescent Society and the World Health Organization who
visited the area, took samples from the sick and sent them to
Nairobi for identification.
</P>
<P>
Unlike in northeastern Kenya, no animals are reportedly dying
of the disease in any of these two places where the disease broke
out.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Coup Plotters Adjourned in Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The trial of seven Qataris
charged with involvement in a 1996 coup attempt has been adjourned
to January 4, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
A panel of three judges has made the decision after receiving
official documents from the state prosecutor general, which list
the charges, and the testimony of witnesses, the Gulf News quoted
a court official as saying.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given to the postponement.
</P>
<P>
The defendants, four military officers and three civilians,
have been accused of forming a clandestine group with the
intention of toppling Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa
al-Thani in February 1996, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
They have also been charged with contacting with foreigners
hostile to Qatar and revealing state secrets for money.
</P>
<P>
Two witnesses have alleged that the accused have been in
regular contacts with foreigners, supplying them with military
secrets of Qatar for money, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"The military officers were paid monthly according to their
ranks in the army and the others in lump sums," it quoted the head
of Qatar's criminal investigation department as saying.
</P>
<P>
"One of them traveled frequently to the United Arab Emirates
and stayed in room No. 605 at the Intercontinental Hotel in Abu
Dhabi and held meetings and dinners with members of a group
hostile to Qatar," the official added.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Tighten Security in N.Irish Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The British government pledged
today to tighten security on Northern Ireland's Maze prison after
a loyalist guerrilla leader was gunned down by Republican inmates
in the jail.
</P>
<P>
Pro-British Protestant gunman Billy Wright was killed last
Saturday while serving imprisonment, which was followed by the
revenge killing of a former Irish Republican Army guerrilla
outside a hotel.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland prisons minister Adam Ingram said random
weekly searches would be introduced at the Maze and an inquiry
would held into the shooting of Wright and how guns were smuggled
into the jail.
</P>
<P>
"We are instituting a program of searches," he said at a news
conference held at the Maze prison near Belfast after holding an
emergency talk with Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam earlier
in the day..
</P>
<P>
Mowlam pledged that the "vicious, senseless murders" of Wright,
leader of the Loyalist Volunteer force, by members of the Irish
National Liberation Army and the revenge killing of a former IRA
gunman would not deflect the search for peace.
</P>
<P>
Three men charged with Wright's murder appeared in court at
Lisburn near Belfast today under tight security.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebel Stronghold Opened to Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A Sierra Leone state
television film crew and three international news agency
reporters including Xinhua were airlifted today aboard a military
helicopter here to visit a rebel stronghold in the east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Kailahun, a place over 230 miles east of Sierra Leone, is
their destination where some 100 Kamajors militiamen were
captured Saturday by rebel combatants.
</P>
<P>
Rufus Ibrahim, commandant of the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF), said "the men surrendered after they were encircled at
Buedu."
</P>
<P>
"We also captured a lot of arms and ammunition including G3
weapons widely used only by the Nigerian contingent in ECOMOG,"
he claimed.
</P>
<P>
One of the surrendered Kamajors told Xinhua, "We were given
the impression that our mission will overrun Buedu but it was a
shock to see so many combatants guarding the town."
</P>
<P>
The team moved on to Kangama where the journalists met a
number of detained RUF dissidents including former top leaders
Fayia Musa, Philip Palmer and Ibrahim Deen-Jalloh.
</P>
<P>
They were involved in a leadership struggle to unseat rebel
leader Foday Sankoh in 1996 and were tried for treason by the
rebel organization and sentenced to death. Previous reports said
they had been executed.
</P>
<P>
Musa, a onetime spokesman for the RUF, looked frail and grey
haired. "We are Okay. We regretted to have plotted against the
organization which we set up to regain the freedom of all Sierra
Leoneans," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Philip Palmer, another former member of the RUF, who was
tipped to replace Sankoh if the coup had succeeded, accused
deposed President Tejan Kabbah of "landing them in trouble."
</P>
<P>
He played a double role by promising us political and
financial support if we are to overthrow Sankoh and sign an
agreement of cooperation with his administration, Palmer added.
</P>
<P>
According to RUF commander Ibrahim, the lives of the
dissidents were saved as a result of the coup in May and the
unity between the rebels and the (military) government.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in seven years that the three towns
regarded as a major stronghold of the rebels have been opened to
"outsiders" including journalists.
</P>
<P>
The towns are perched on the fringes of the Liberian border
and heavily fortified by bazooka-carrying youngsters and bobby
traps with AA guns mounted on high ground. Women with babies
strapped to their backs till the rice farms with the assistance
of oxen.

MAPUTO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Five people have died of
cholera in the last three days in Mozambique, a senior health
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Avertino Barreto, deputy director of the National Health
Bureau, said here that the five deaths had been recorded since
last Saturday. Among them, three were reported in Xai-Xai,
capital of Gaza province, and two were from places outside the
capital Maputo.
</P>
<P>
A total of 267 new cholera patients were reported in the past
two days, putting the accelerated number in the country at 8,680.
</P>
<P>
However, Jose Chivale, head of the epidemic vigilance system
under the country's health ministry, said last Friday at a press
conference that the damage brought by cholera has been reduced
remarkably in the four southern provinces of Maputo, Gaza, Manica
and Inhambane, owing to the efforts made in improving the
environment and personal hygiene.
</P>
<P>
So far, 256 people have died of the epidemic since its
outbreak on August 13. However, the disease is only confined to
the four southern provinces.

<HEADLINE> No Technical Problem for Plane Crash in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The investigation team on
the December 15 Tajik aircraft crash in the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) today ruled out "technical failures," which have been widely
believed to be the reason of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
An initial analysis on the plane's digital flight data
recorder, commonly known as the black box, showed there is no
"technical failures in any part of the aircraft," UAE's Wam News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The analysis was from the UAE-CIS (Commonwealth of Independent
States) joint investigation team.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion is different from a senior UAE aviation
official's suggestion on December 16 that the accident was caused
by "engine problems."
</P>
<P>
Some other UAE officials who did not want to be named said the
plane might explode in mid-air, however, there was no official
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Wam also said that medical analysis on the crew members of the
Tajik Tu-154 showed there was no narcotics in their blood.
</P>
<P>
There were nine crew members aboard when the plan crashed in
the UAE deserts. Eighty-five people were killed and Roberto
Serje, the co-pilot, was the only survivor. He is now in a
hospital in the UAE receiving treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Tu-154 Tajik aircraft crash was the second recorded air
disaster in the UAE. On September 23, 1983, an Abu Dhabi-bound
Gulf Air Boeing 737 coming from Karachi crashed in the UAE's
deserts, killing 112 people aboard.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Turkmenistan Launche Gas Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami stated here today that Iran and Turkmenistan have launched
a gas pipeline, a joint project aiming to send natural gas to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the remarks on his return from a two-day official
visit to Ashkhabad, saying that he and Turkmenian President
Saparmurat Niyazov Monday traveled to the eastern desert of
Turkmenistan and formally inaugurated the economically important
project.
</P>
<P>
Khatami arrived in Ashkhabad Sunday on his first foreign visit
since he was elected President in May.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline of 200 kilometers was built from Turkmenistan to
northern Iran at a cost of 195 million dollars, 80 percent of
which has been paid by Iran. It will deliver about 4 billion cubic
meters of natural gas a year to Iran and will be connected to
another pipeline to reach Europe via Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan, a former Soviet central Asian republic, is
desperately seeking a outlet for is huge natural gas reserves to
the rest of the world. Until now, it has only one export pipeline
through Russia which is competing with Turkmenistan in the world
gas market.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the presidents of Turkmenistan and Iran also
jointly inaugurated a project of fiber optics.
</P>
<P>
The fiber optics project, which was implemented by Iran's
telecommunications company in Turkmenistan, is a part of the
Asia-Europe fiber optics project from Shanghai, China and through
Iran to Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that the two countries would also build an oil
pipeline through Iran to the Persian Gulf to export Turkmenian crude
oil, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the two countries have discussed the issue of
building new oil pipeline during his visit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that the opening of the two projects would
promote the cooperation between Iran and Turkmenistan and would
also pave the way for Iran to speed up Iran's exports of
technology and manpower to the Central Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Iran and Turkmenistan also discussed the issue
of legal regime of the Caspian sea, Khatami said, voicing
Tehran's stand that all of the Caspian Sea littoral countries
should limit their exploration operations within the legal regime.
</P>
<P>
Iran repeatedly stated that the legal regime governing the
Caspian Sea has been provided for in the 1921 Iran-Russian
Treaty of Amity and the 1940 Commerce and Navigation Agreement
between Iran and former Soviet Union.

</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency, the cabinet might also

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Bad weather conditions in
various parts of Kenya have forced the Electoral Commission to
make a decision to extend today's general elections for one more
day.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made this afternoon following a general delay
in the opening of the polling stations in this east African
country due to bad weather and poor transport.
</P>
<P>
In Mwingi District, a vehicle with ballot materials and
election officials was swept away this morning by the flooded
Enziu River near Nguni town.
</P>
<P>
All the six ballot boxes were however salvaged intact but two
pressure lamps were washed away along with the vehicle, the Kenya
News Agency (KNA) report today.
</P>
<P>
Francis Katua, District Election Co-ordinator, was quoted as
saying that heavy rains dumped in the area last night had
impaired the polling exercise in the district.
</P>
<P>
A total of six polling stations were kept waiting for six
hours as the vehicles carrying balloting materials got stuck at
Thokoa area, he added.
</P>
<P>
Peter Obilo, returning officer for Turkana South constituency,
today called for an arrangement to fly the ballot boxes to
polling stations in his constituency this morning when the ballot
boxes and papers have not arrived due to impassable roads.
</P>
<P>
In Tana River District, a helicopter is urgently needed to
airlift election officials and ballot boxes to flooded areas
within Galole constituency, the KNA reported.
</P>
<P>
About 200 officials including presiding officers and security
personnel deployed to the polling stations in the constituency
have been stranded at Hola Social Hall since Sunday waiting for
an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Three flooded constituencies in Garissa District, Northeastern
Province, missed today's elections due to lack of transport for
officers and ballot papers, according to a Kenya Television

<HEADLINE> Nyerere in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere arrived here today to pay a three-day surprise
visit to Zambia amid speculations that he came here to mediate a
release of detained former President K. Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
When asked if his visit is related to detention of Kaunda,
Nyerere did not deny or say "yes".
</P>
<P>
He was greeted at the airport by three Zambian ministers
including Foreign Minister Keli Walubita.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere is expected to have private talks with Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
The post newspaper of Zambia today quoted diplomatic sources
in Dar es Salaam of Tanzania as saying that southern African
presidents are to approach Nyerere to intercede with the Zambian
government to secure the release from detention of Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is reported to be spearheaded by South African
President Nelson Mandela in consultation with Ketumile Masire of
Botswana, Joachim Chissano of Mozambique, Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe, Sam Nujoma of Namibia and Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was arrested last Thursday allegedly in connection with
the October 28 abortive coup. He returned home last Monday after
a marathon overseas trip, which took him to India, South Africa,
Zimbabwe, the United States and Britain among other countries.
</P>
<P>
He went abroad on the eve of the coup to seek international
pressure on the government.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Pledges Not to Resume Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cape Town, December 29 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela reiterated today that his government would
establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of
China in late 1997 and never resume official ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen here, Mandela said diplomatic ties
between South Africa and Taiwan would never be resumed after the
normalization of Pretoria-Beijing relations due to be realized as
of January 1.
</P>
<P>
Mandela announced in November last year that his government
would sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan and establish
comprehensive relations with the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the reason of setting up diplomatic relations
with China, Mandela said that China, a permanent member in the
United Nations Security Council, is one of the most populous
states in the world where economy is developing very fast.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interest of South Africa to have diplomatic ties
with the People's Republic of China," Mandela noted, adding his
government will uphold "one-China policy".
</P>
<P>
In response, Qian firstly relay greetings from Chinese
President Jiang Zemin who invited Mandela to visit China at his
convenience while Mandela also asked Qian to convey his best
regards to Jiang and invited him to visit South Africa as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Qian said the forthcoming
normalization of Sino-South African relations is not only a big
event in the history of the two countries, but also conducive to
world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The peoples of the two countries will be very happy about
this, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that there is great potentiality in economic
exchange and trade between China and South Africa, saying that
China is willing to make positive contribution to the development
of South African economy.
</P>
<P>
Qian arrived in South Africa Sunday for a five-day official
visit at the invitation of his South African counterpart Alfred
Nzo. The two ministers will meet Tuesday over bilateral relations
and sign a joint communique on the establishment of official
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian will attend the opening ceremony of the Chinese embassy
in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his meeting with Mandela, Qian also had friendly
talks with Premier of Gauteng Province Tokyo Sexwale, with the
two sides pledging to continue promoting cooperation in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Qian's visit are his wife Zhou Hanqiong, Deputy
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng
and Assistant Foreign Minister Ji Peiding.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Oslo Peace Process in Dire Straits (By Zhi Linfei) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Despite the short-lived
optimism created by January's signing of the Hebron redeployment
accord, the year 1997 witnessed the longest deadlock in the
Israeli-Palestinian Oslo peace process since it began four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Following Israel's start of building the controversial Har
Homa settlement in the hotly disputed East Jerusalem in March, the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process plunged into a seven-month-long
deadlock marked by sporadic violence and terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
The Har Homa project was part of the new Israeli government's
attempt to replace the land-for-peace principle, the corner-stone
of Oslo process, with the security-for-peace formula.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) halted
security cooperation and peace talks with Israel to register its
anger and protest. But this played into the hands of Israeli
government, which was in fact trying to derail the Oslo process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's expansion of existing settlements in the
Palestinian territories was also in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Israel's another major action to erode the Oslo process was
the deliberate delays in redeploying troops from the West
Bank. In early March, Israel unilaterally approved the scope of
the first stage of a three-phased troop redeployment at 9 percent,
which fell far short of the 30 percent as expected by the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The PNA rejected the unilaterally-set pullback only to provide
Israel a good excuse to delay also the second pullback, which
should have been completed by early September under the Hebron
accord.
</P>
<P>
The terrorism issue has become the most commonly used excuse
for Israel to delay the implementing of the signed agreements.
Following the July 30 and September 4 suicide bombing attacks in
two Jerusalem markets launched by Hamas, in which 25 people were
killed and hundreds of others wounded, Israel reacted quickly by
freezing transfer of land to pressure the PNA to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Although the freeze in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks was
broken in early October as a result of the efforts by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who visited the region
for the first time in late September, no substantial progress has
been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Israel's intransigence on security arrangements blocked any
real progress in the negotiations on the interim issues, including
opening the Gaza airport, building a Gaza seaport, and creating a
safe passage between the Palestinian self-rule Gaza Strip and West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
In late November, Israeli Cabinet, under tremendous pressure
from Washington which grew increasingly impatient with the lack of
progress in the peace process, approved in principle to carry out
the second troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu proposed to blend all the three stages of
redeployments in one operation as a part of the final-status
talks. The PNA blasted it as a ploy to avoid implementing the
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Israel's deliberate derailment of the Oslo process
was apparently aimed at forcing the PNA to agree to enter
permanent talks when Israel is still at a dominant position
by holding up the further redeployments as crucial bargaining
chips.
</P>
<P>
It has become clear that Israel's bottom line is that it will
only hand over about 40-50 percent of West Bank to the PNA in the
final settlement, far short of the over 80 percent that the PNA is
dreaming of.
</P>
<P>
Being aware of the danger of accepting Israel's proposal for
bypassing the interim stage of the Oslo Process, PNA President
Yasser Arafat has been sticking to his demand for strict and
accurate implementation of the signed accords. In view of the huge
gap between the two sides, few can expect progress in near future.
</P>
<P>
In the coming year, the countdown to the Oslo process,
that is due to end in May 1999, will begin. In a warning
issued in November, Arafat declared that he would declare
Palestinian independence regardless of the Israeli opposition upon
the end of the Oslo process, but Netanyahu counter-threatened
that he would annex large parts of the West Bank if Arafat
does so.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent the collapse of Oslo process and push
forward the deeply-troubled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, the
U.S. government and international community are expected to
increase pressure on both Israel and the PNA to narrow their
gap.
</P>
<P>
There are good reasons to fear for an escalated
Israeli-Palestinian tension if Israel continues refusing to return
to the course of Oslo process before it is too late.

<HEADLINE> Penalty Phase Begins in Oklahoma Bombing Conspirator Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Jurors in Denver, Colorado,
began hearing testimony today in the penalty phase of the Terry
Nichols trial to decide whether he should die for his role in
bombing the federal building in Oklahoma in 1995, news reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Last week the jurors deliberated 41 hours over six days before
convicting Nichols of conspiracy and involuntary manslaughter in
the April 19, 1995 bombing that killed 168 people. But they found
Nichols innocent of using a truck bomb to kill and destroy the
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and innocent of murder,
concluding he did not set out to kill anyone.
</P>
<P>
In June, Timothy McVeigh was found guilty of conspiracy and
murder charges for the same crimes and sentenced to death. His
appeal is pending.
</P>
<P>
After hearing witnesses for both sides and arguments from the
attorneys, jurors will have to decide whether Nichols should be
executed or spend his life in prison. If they can't decide, it
will be up to U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch to decide on a
lesser sentence.
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy had vowed to try
Nichols and McVeigh on state murder charges. Others said it would
be impossible for the two men to get a fair trial in Oklahoma.

<HEADLINE> Urge for Changes Dominates Kenya's General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Although Kenyans varied much
over who they were voting for on the election day today, their
demands for social changes seemed to be dominating clearly on the
back of their minds.
</P>
<P>
"I want change," were the words of almost all voters who were
interviewed by Xinhua today. According to them, improvement in
state administrations is a key priority.
</P>
<P>
"Everything should get changes, especially the leadership,"
said a fashionable girl, who blamed the current government for
low efficiency, bad road transport, economic slow-down and
rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
The girl had been waiting for more than four hours outside the
polling station at the Highridge Primary School, Westlands, which
is one of the largest constituencies in the country. The station
was due to open at 6:00 a.m. but only saw the first vote cast
there at 10:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
"Even if (incumbent President Daniel arap) Moi retains his
power, changes must be made, otherwise the country will continue
to get worse," said a white middle-aged Kenyan who predicted that
the 73-year-old Moi, who was in power since 1978, would get
through as expected by many people.
</P>
<P>
Moi, when seeking his final five-year term, faces powerful
challengers including Mwai Kibaki of the Democratic Party,
Charity Ngilu of the Social Democratic Party, Raila Odinga of the
National Development Party and Kijana Wamalwa of FORD-Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Promises for change keynoted the three-week election campaigns
by the above so-called "Big Five" who all pledged to jump-start
the economy, remove corruptions, improve infrastructure, conduct
educational reforms, promote privatization and etc.
</P>
<P>
Many people said although issues like corruption, unemployment
and poor infrastructure might lead Moi to a possible Waterloo, he
was in great advantages due to sharp divisions in the Opposition
and to his most diluted tribal color.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems that common Kenyans choose their leaders
with much divided reasons and many of them vote in accordance
with their tribal line.
</P>
<P>
"Moi is good, I support him because he helps me get a job," a
young man working with the Ministry of Education told Xinhua on
his way to the polling station.
</P>
<P>
"I choose Moi because he loves peace," said a nurse working
for a Chinese clinic in downtown Nairobi. Moi is recognized home
and abroad as a prominent and active peace-broker in east Africa
and the Horn of Africa region.
</P>
<P>
"Why we voted for Kibaki? Because he is an economist," said
an aged Asian-origin couple when leaving the polling station.
</P>
<P>
"I have voted for Kibaki because he has more experiences in
the management of political and economic affairs," said Gitonga
Njorogo, a 22-year-old student, after casting his ballot.
</P>
<P>
"I will vote for Odinga. He is from my tribe," said a security
personnel working for a foreign media institution. He is a Luo
from western Nyanza province.
</P>
<P>
"By the way, I'm not ready to vote for a woman (C. Ngilu)," he
added. Ngilu is one of the first two women ever to vie for the
top seat in Kenya. They have attracted many voters, especially
educated people in urban areas due to her strong calls for
changes and her fresh image untainted by scandals.
</P>
<P>
"Men have ruled the country for a long time. May women prove
they are better," said a Luo girl working for a non-governmental
organization here, who will cast her ballot in favor of Ngilu.
</P>
<P>
More than nine million registered voters today formed long
queues to elect one president, 210 parliamentary members and
2,955 local councillors across this east African country with a
population of some 28 million.
</P>
<P>
All polling stations in the country were scheduled to open at
6:00 a.m. for 12 hours but delay was common, which forced the
polling to be extended to Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Under Kenya's law, the winning presidential candidate must
garner the highest total and collect at least 25 percent of the
votes in at least five of Kenya's eight provinces.
</P>
<P>
A total of 883 candidates from 23 parties are running for the
parliamentary seats while 8,446 vying for civic elections.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Siamese Twins to Be Separated in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- South African and
foreign neurosurgeons will work together Tuesday to try to
separate 11-month-old Siamese twins from Zambia, in an operation
expected to take at least 20 hours.
</P>
<P>
The team, which comprises neurosurgeons from South Africa, the
United States, Zambia and other countries, would perform the
operation at Garankuwa hospital in Pretoria, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The hospital's superintendent, Dr. Reg Broekmann, said today
that the boys, Luka and Joseph Banda, were joined at the top of
their heads and preliminary tests had indicated that they
probably had separate brains.
</P>
<P>
Broekmann said the operation was being done in South Africa at
the request of the Zambian government, since Zambia did not have
the necessary facilities.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, the operation might be completed Tuesday, he
said. But it was also likely that the operation take two phases,
10 days within each other.
</P>
<P>
Should this be the case, the twins would have to rest for 10
days to allow new veins to develop before the second part of the
operation can proceed, Broekmann said.

<HEADLINE> US Welcomes Norway's Role in Mideast </HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. said today that it
welcomes Norway's interest in reviving Middle East peace talks
despite unflattering remarks by Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut
Vollebaek about the U.S. role in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The Norwegians have long played an extremely helpful role in
the Middle East peace process, and so we would certainly welcome
their continued efforts," said State Department spokesman James
Foley.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian-sponsored secret talks led to a significant
breakthrough between Israel and the Palestinians in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Foley said he does not believe the Norwegian initiative will
disrupt the American effort.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek plans to travel to the Middle East next month for
talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. He said the talks the
two sides have had with Washington can be useful for a while "but
it's obvious that it's limited."
</P>
<P>
Foley rejected that characterization, pointing out that U.S.
diplomats helped restart the process after setbacks this past
summer brought on by terrorist bombings.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Discourages Lantos' Interest in Visiting Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S State Department on
Monday confirmed that Democratic Representative Tom Lantos had
expressed his interest in visiting Iran but was discouraged by the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
"He has expressed an interest in visiting Iran but let me
emphasize should he actually be traveling to Iran it would not
be at the request of the White House or the State Department,"
State Department spokesman James Foley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the White House denied a report from a Gulf
state's official news agency that Lantos had been sent by the
Clinton administration to Tehran in an effort to find any
evidence for the changes of Iranian foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"We have no plans to send a special envoy to Tehran at all,"
White House spokesman Eric Rubin said. The reported visit was
"news to us," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Foley confirmed that, although the Clinton administration
had not sent Lantos to Tehran as a special envoy, Lantos himself
expressed his wishes to go there.
</P>
<P>
Foley, however, said it was something "that we would
discourage."
</P>
<P>
"It is not something that we encourage and again if he were to
travel he would not be traveling as special envoy or as a
representative of the United States government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foley told reporters that Lantos, a California Democrat and a
senior member of the House of Representatives International
Relations Committee, had been in touch with both the State
Department and the White House to discuss a possible trip to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Lantos's talks of traveling to Tehran came at a time when
both Iranian and U.S. leaders voiced conciliatory remarks over
the relations between the two countries, which severed their
diplomatic relations after 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who won a presidential
election in May, expressed his hope to restore dialogue with the
United States at a news conference in Tehran on December 14 and
U.S. President Bill Clinton responded two day later with a
positive tone for that proposal.
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a tragic that the United States was
separated from the people of Iran," Clinton said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed the U.S. position for the possible dialogue,
saying three issues should be discussed before any dialogue
could be considered.
</P>
<P>
The three allegations include: Iran's support and funding for
terrorism, opposition to the U.S.-sponsored Middle East peace
process and its development of weapons of mass destruction, all
of which the Iranian government has flatly denied.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Forced to Consider Withdrawing State Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- After a major defeat in the
Knesset (parliament) today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is now considering to withdraw the 1998 state budget
draft from Knesset (parliament), local radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Likud government suffered major
budget defeat in the Knesset this afternoon as it lost the
votes to the opposition on the budget arrangements bill by 7
ballots, 48 to 55.
</P>
<P>
In today's vote, the coalition ministers David Levy, Yehoshua
Matza, Natan Sharansky and Yuli Edelstein did not show up
for the vote.
</P>
<P>
All seven Yisrael Ba'aliya Knesset members were absent and
three Gesher Knesset members voted against the government.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 coalition Knesset members has declared recently that
they opposed all or part of the budget arrangements bill and
refused to vote for the new state budget, which include a 2.3
billion shekels (about 660 million U.S. dollars) cut.
</P>
<P>
Members of small parties in the coalition government have been
demanding more shares of the budget for their respective
ministries, refusing to accept the cuts.
</P>
<P>
Limor Livnat, minister from the leading Likud party in the
government, said today she believed that the best way for Netanyahu
is to withdraw the current budget and submitted another one before
March 31 following the government defeat today.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible according to the legislation, we can throw it
into the end of March. And I think this would be the best idea,
because if it can not be passed now, I do think we have to pay
more for other coalition parties."
</P>
<P>
By law, the state budget must be passed into law by midnight on
December 31, and the vote is automatically one of confidence in
the government. However, if the government fails it then has a
three-month probationary period to reverse the situation and get
the budget passed.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu denied Sunday night that he had been making great
concession to his coalition partners on the 1998 state budget in
an effort to gain their support for passing it by its December 31
deadline.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government had reduced the national deficit by
7 billion shekels (about 2 billion dollars) and this was a "major
achievement" though conceding that such cuts caused "suffering
and problems."

<HEADLINE> WHO Recommends No Travel Restrictions amid Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) does not recommend travel restrictions despite an outbreak
of a disease of unknown origin in northeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
In a press release here on Monday, WHO emphasized that the
disease is not a threat to tourists in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Dr David Heymann, Director of WHO's Division of Emerging and
other Communicable Diseases, was quoted as saying that the disease
has occurred in a very remote rural area of northeastern Kenya,
near the border with Somalia, and the area is far away from the
tourist centers of Nairobi, Mombassa and the national parks.
</P>
<P>
WHO, together with Kenyan health officials and non-governmental
organizations, currently has teams investigating the outbreak in
Kenya and in Somalia south of Mogadishu, where a second localized
outbreak is suspected to have occurred.
</P>
<P>
Due to the difficulty of access to the region involved, the
full extent of the outbreak is not yet known but reports indicate
that up to 250 people may have died from the disease.
</P>
<P>
Similar disease and deaths in domestic animals, goats, sheep,
cattle and camels, have been reported in the same area, according
to WHO. Initial epidemiological data from Kenya do not support the
diagnosis of Ebola haemorrhagic fever as a cause of the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
WHO said that anthrax bacillus, and other infectious agents
such as yellow fever and Rift Valley fever, all of which are known
to be endemic in the region, are currently being considered as
possible causes of this outbreak.

<P>
MACAO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- More people in Macao are calling
a hotline offering counseling service on family issues, personal
relationship and love, the Va Kio newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There have been more than 3,000 calls for help at the Life
Hotline run by the Macao Charity so far this year, up about 400
from last year.
</P>

help on mental problems also rose considerably.

<P>
Macao has seen a sluggish economy for the third year running,
and the unemployment rate was recorded at three percent in the
August-October period this year, with the number of jobless at
about several thousand.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the increasing callers, a spokesman for the Macao
Charity said that the organization plans to add more volunteers
for the hotline next year.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that we will not only listen, but we also want to go
out and help," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Macao Graduates Favor Jobs With Big Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Most Macao graduates have
dropped their idea of becoming a government employee for the first
time, and chosen to be employed by big companies instead, a sample
survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Co-conducted in September and October among 150 young graduates
by the Macao Foundation and the Education and Youth Department of
Macao, the survey shows that most graduates have shifted their
idea of becoming a government employee to being one of a brand
name company.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, graduated students of middle
schools and colleges dreamed to be a civil servant as the salary
of government employee is usually five to six times those with
ordinary companies.
</P>
<P>
As a result, competitions became increasingly fiercer. There
were usually several hundred people trying to seek one post with
the government offices.
</P>
<P>
According to results of the survey which was made public this
month, it usually took a graduate one and half months to get a
job. Most of the respondents are now working as clerks and
teachers, with none as vendors, farmers or fishermen.
</P>
<P>
The survey also finds that their average monthly salary reached
between 5,000 and 6,000 patacas (625 U.S. dollars to 700 U.S.
dollars), and they usually worked between eight to nine hours a
day.
</P>
<P>
About 46 percent of the respondents were women. A total of 130
out of the 150 surveyed were graduates of colleges in Macao and
China's inland.

<HEADLINE> Philippine government, Rebels Defer Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have finally
set their next meeting on February 2-3 in southern Mindanao, a
rebel leader said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs, said
that chief government negotiator Orlando Soriano has recently
agreed to the request by the MILF to defer the date of the
scheduled meeting from January to February.
</P>
<P>
Murad said this will enable the MILF to religiously observe the
Holy Month of Ramadhan on January next year.
</P>
<P>
According to Murad, the talks was first scheduled on December
22-23 but was postponed on request by the government peace panel
whose members cited Christmas celebration as reason.
</P>
<P>
"In return," he said, "the government panel likewise granted
our request in order for us to be also with our love ones during
Ramadhan."
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be held in Marawi city, capital of Lanao del
Sur Province, will discuss the agenda for reaching a preliminary
peace agreement between the MILF and the government, Murad said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), is currently the largest Muslim rebel
group in the country, with an estimated membership of 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF signed a permanent peace agreement with the government
in September 1996, but the MILF refused to be included in the
agreement.

<HEADLINE> State State Approves Building of China's Largest Sea Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- State Council, China's highest
governing body, has approved an enormous project, the Lingdingyang
Bridge spanning the sea between Zhuhai and Hong Kong, according to
local government sources.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the six-lane bridge, which will be 27
kilometers long and 33 meters wide, will cost about 16.6 billion
yuan (two billion U.S. dollars) in dynamic investment and take six
years to complete, said Liang Guangda, secretary of Zhuhai city
committee of the Communist Party of China, at a news conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five percent of registered construction capital will come
from the state and Guangdong provincial departments of
transportation and Zhuhai city, Liang said, and 45 percent from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Lingdingyang Bridge Project Company will be responsible for
raising extra funds and operating the whole project, the largest
sea bridge in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai, one of five special economic zones in China, faces Hong
Kong across the Lingdingyang Sea.
</P>
<P>
As another passage linking Hong Kong and inland areas, the
bridge is expected to ease road traffic through Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of departments and research institutes have been
involved in feasibility studies of the project since 1992,
including studies of seismology, environmental protection,
geology, hydrology and ocean transportation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and British governments began discussing the
project in 1995. The results were approved by the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region after Hong Kong's return to China on
July 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that China is ready to
help South Africa in its reconstruction and national development.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate very much the program of reconstruction and
development that was formulated by the government of South
Africa," Qian told a news conference jointly held with South
African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo.
</P>
<P>
"China stands ready to be involved in the development in South
Africa, in particular, in the fields of rural housing, education,
power supply and communications."
</P>
<P>
Before the news conference, Qian and Nzo signed a joint
communique to establish diplomatic relations between the two
countries as from January 1, 1998, as well as five other
agreements, including a package of aid from China.
</P>
<P>
Qian said South Africa is a major country in Africa while
China is the biggest country in Asia. "The establishment of
friendly relations and cooperation between China and South
Africa, undoubtedly, is in the interests of our two peoples and
also in the interests of world peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian announced that China will set up consulate generals in
Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban and that China has appointed
Wang Xuexian, Director of the Chinese Center for South African
Studies, as its first ambassador to South Africa. The appointment
has won consent from the South African side, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nzo told the press conference that South Africa will benefit
from the friendly relations with China, which has a vibrant
economy and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
"Now South Africa has added one more ally to that important
organ of international community (the UN), which should make it
easier for us to play our part and role in international politics
in the interests of the defense of peace and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa's relationship with China was
long-standing, and the establishment of diplomatic relations with
it represents a continuation of friendship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to South Africa's severance of ties with Taiwan, Nzo
said: "It was inevitable that South Africa would come to a
position of recognizing international practice."
</P>
<P>
"The government of the Republic of South Africa recognizes
that there is but one China in the world, the government of the
People's Republic of China is the sole legal government
representing the whole of china and recognizes China's position
that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China," the joint
communique says.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela declared in November
1996 that South Africa would sever ties with Taiwan and recognize
the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is in South Africa for a five-day visit, has met
Mandela and some other South African leaders. He is expected to
open the Chinese Embassy in Pretoria on Thursday.

BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Cultural exchanges between
China's inland areas and the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) hit a new record in 1997 in terms of the number of
exchange programs and people involved.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, the number of such activities arranged

<P>
Cooperation between mainland and Hong Kong artists, traditional
Chinese arts and artistic academic exchanges constitute the major

<HEADLINE> Macao Graduates Favor Jobs With Big Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Most Macao graduates have
dropped their idea of becoming a government employee for the first
time, and chosen to be employed by big companies instead, a sample
survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Co-conducted in September and October among 150 young graduates
by the Macao Foundation and the Education and Youth Department of
Macao, the survey shows that most graduates have shifted their
idea of becoming a government employee to being one of a brand
name company.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, graduated students of middle
schools and colleges dreamed to be a civil servant as the salary
of government employee is usually five to six times those with
ordinary companies.
</P>
<P>
As a result, competitions became increasingly fiercer. There
were usually several hundred people trying to seek one post with
the government offices.
</P>
<P>
According to results of the survey which was made public this
month, it usually took a graduate one and half months to get a
job. Most of the respondents are now working as clerks and
teachers, with none as vendors, farmers or fishermen.
</P>
<P>
The survey also finds that their average monthly salary reached
between 5,000 and 6,000 patacas (625 U.S. dollars to 700 U.S.
dollars), and they usually worked between eight to nine hours a
day.
</P>
<P>
About 46 percent of the respondents were women. A total of 130
out of the 150 surveyed were graduates of colleges in Macao and
China's inland.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy to Maintain Steady Growth in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of a "soft
landing" and significant improvement in macro-economic conditions,
China's economy will continue its momentum of fast development and
low inflation in 1998, said Ye Zheng, a spokesman with the State
Statistical Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
Ye said today that China has an ample stock of commodities,
with a lot of bottlenecks in infrastructure largely eased and
investment conditions upgraded. In addition, the new policies made
by the 15th national congress of the Communist Party of China has
triggered a stronger reform wave to streamline the country's
economic system.
</P>
<P>
All these positive factors will play a bigger role next year,
and guarantee a robust growth in investment and consumption as
well as a fairly stable import volume, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a strong demand for investment is expected to
emerge in agriculture, infrastructure facilities and
high-technology sectors in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the per capita income of people in both urban and
rural areas this year went up by 2.9 percent and 4 percent,
respectively, providing a sound basis for further increases in
domestic consumption next year.
</P>
<P>
The central government reduced interest rates twice this year,
and thus enhance the potential for both investment and
consumption. Such positive effects caused by the last interest
rate cut will surface early next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ye acknowledged that the country could slow its pace in
attracting foreign investment because of the ongoing financial
crisis in Southeast Asia and the widespread wait-and-see attitude
of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the huge market potential, in addition to the
improved investment conditions and government's preferential
policies here, should keep China favorable for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Ye said the currency depreciation in Southeast Asian nations
will not cause serious impacts on China's imports next year,
because China now has a more comprehensive import mix and cheaper
labor than its rivals in Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Extremists Demonstrate in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of members of the
Jewish extremist group, the Temple Mount Faithfuls, held a
protest march today in East Jerusalem as the Muslim holy month
Ramadan started.
</P>
<P>
Escorted by armed police, the protesters marched from the
Damascus Gate of the Old City to the outside of the Temple
Mount, where the third holiest Muslim shrine the Aksa mosque
stands.
</P>
<P>
They later marched on to the Orient House, the de facto
office of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in East
Jerusalem. To avoid possible disturbances, police prevented the
group from burning the PNA flags before the building.
</P>
<P>
The Temple Mount Faithfuls advocates rebuilding the destroyed
holy Jewish temple on the Temple Mount. Every year, the group
has been trying to march into the Temple Mount compound to
assert Israeli claim over the holy place, but they were denied
entry by police for fear of sparking widespread violence between
Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Gershon Salomon, leader of the Temple Mount Faithfuls,
charged today the secret agency General Security Service (GSS)
for provoking his group and other Jewish rightist groups in
order to prosecute them.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that two Jewish extremists Avigdor Eskin and
Haim Pakovitch, who were arrested recently for trying to throw
pig heads into the Temple Mount during Ramadan, are in fact
GSS provocateurs. The two were brought on trial Sunday in Tel
Aviv on charges of provoking violence.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing police Inspector General, Assaf Hefetz, warned
earlier this week that Jewish extremists are planning to damage
the Muslim holy shrines in East Jerusalem and destroy the
peace process. He called on Israeli religious leaders and
rightwing politicians to strain the extremists and condemn their
provoking actions.

Li Peng called on the staff workers in the country's power
industry to intensify reforms so as to maintain a steady and
healthy development.
</P>
<P>
The industry has achieved a fast growth in the past two
decades. As for seven years running, the large and medium-sized
generating units with the total capacity of more than 10 million
kw have been put into operation annually. The total power generating
capacity reached 250 million kw this year.
</P>
<P>
However, development of power industries in different regions
remains unbalanced even though a serious shortage of power
nationwide has been eased in recent years, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the State Power Corporation of China (SP) to speed up
constructions of grids in order to make better use of hydropower
resources and coal, which are abundant in the west.
</P>
<P>
A national grid is going to take shape as regional grids in
eastern, northeastern, northern and central parts of China are
linked.
</P>
<P>
The corporation was asked to maintain a safe operation of the
national grid, as well as a fair and reasonable control of
electricity prices.
</P>
<P>
Overseas capitals should be used reasonably in the country's
power industry, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Attending today's conference included Wu Bangguo, vice premier
of the State Council, and Shi Dazhen, Minister of Electric Power
and general manager of SP.

<HEADLINE> Quality of Huaihe River Approaches Drinking Water Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The water quality of the
Huaihe River's trunk stream is approaching drinking water
standards, according to the latest statistics from the China
Environment Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
This means that the drinking water problem of residents along
the river has been eased, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 78 percent of the seriously polluted sections have shown
remarkable water quality improvement, and the contents of organic
pollutants at 17 of the 18 major monitoring sites are equal to or
better than the standards set for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
East China's Anhui and Jiangsu provinces have shown the
greatest improvement.
</P>
<P>
The water in Xinyang Prefecture on the upper reaches of the
Huaihe River has reached reservoir standards, and so have some
sections in the middle and lower reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
Although the river valley has suffered from drought since June,
and water flow has decreased by a large margin, the pollution
problem still has been eased.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the monitoring center attribute the improvement to
efforts by major polluters in the valley. However, they warn that
the pollution situation is still serious, and more efforts are
still required.
</P>
<P>
All the factories in the Huaihe River Valley should meet
national wastewater emission standards by Dec. 31, according to
the requirements of the State Council, or face compulsory
closure.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Digging Out from Heavy Snowfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Governments at all levels in
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region are battling the effects
of snowstorms which have caused serious problems in the region, an
official from the regional government said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ciren Sanzhu, vice-chairman of the regional government, said in
an interview with Xinhua that the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council have
expressed deep concerns about the disaster in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
According to Ciren, snowstorms started in September and
expanded to six prefectures and cities in the region in December.
</P>
<P>
Nagqu Prefecture reported snowfall 40 times since September,
including five heavy storms in 11 counties.
</P>
<P>
Starting on Dec. 9, heavy snowfall expanded to 40 counties in
six prefectures and cities in the region, with the snowfall in
some places reaching 95 mm within 24 hours, he added.
</P>
<P>
The snow reportedly is the heaviest since Tibet began keeping
meterological records, and the minimum temperature in some
locations is 34 degrees Celsius below zero, the vice-chairman said.
</P>
<P>
A group of townships and villages suffered blackouts because of
the snow, Ciren said.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the central government, the regional
government has allocated 27.25 million yuan in relief funds for
disaster relief along with large quantities of grain, foods, fuel,
clothes, and instruments.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-chairman, the regional government has
decided to grant 4.9 million yuan more in relief funds for 50,000
snowstorm victims, along with 400,000 liters of fuel.
</P>
<P>
He said that governments at all levels, the masses of people,
cardres and workers from local government agencies and armed
forces in the region all have joined the efforts to fight against
snowstorm-related damage. No deaths have been reported, however.
</P>
<P>
Ciren said he is convinced that the region will win the fight
with the help of the central government and people from across the
country.

<HEADLINE> Australian Tourist Market to Soften in 1998: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The rapidly growing
Australian tourist industry was predicted to be softening next
year in the wake of the Asian currency crisis, a spokesman from
the Tourism Ministry said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official said the general view was the Asian fallout would
probably kick in mid-way through next year, or even a little
earlier.
</P>
<P>
"We will see some deceleration of growth but we don't expect to
go into negative growth," the spokesman was quoted by the
Australian Associated Press (AAP) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Australian Tourist Commission Chief John Morse predicted 1998
would not be an easy year for the tourist industry and would be
particularly tough for the airlines.
</P>
<P>
"It could be one of the toughest years on record for the
airline industry in respect of competition and airfares with a lot
more code sharing of routes," Morse said.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm still quite confident about Asia in the mid to
long-term and those economies are going to come back around the
turn of the century."
</P>
<P>
He said, meanwhile, the tourist industry would look more to the
U.S. and European markets which had experienced growth due to the
devaluation of the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Training Australia Chief Executive Bill Galvin conceded
1998 would be challenging. He said tourism was still a major
growth industry with 55,000 new jobs, or six percent jobs growth,
to be created.
</P>
<P>
However, Australian Tourist Commission Managing Director Bruce
Baird said he did not believe the industry would reach a projected
jobs growth of six percent next year, saying that it was more
likely to be closer to three percent.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is the tourism has been hit by the South-East Asian
currency problems and so that the number of people coming from
Asia, which is a major source for us, has been slowing," Baird
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's new Prisons
Director-General Omar Mohamed Dan Tuesday pledged to upgrade
prison-based industries to help jails be self-financing and less
dependent on government funds.
</P>
<P>
Omar formally took over the post Tuesday from out-going

</P>
<P>
The new prisons chief, who was promoted from the post of the

</P>
<P>
The paper would also spell out the Prisons Department's further
cost-cutting measures, Omar told reporters Tuesday in Kajang, some

Inmates in Malaysia have been churning out products such as
furniture, handicrafts, clothing and carpets for sale to the
public.
</P>
<P>
Omar was quoted as saying "Prison-based industries involving 35
jails nation-wide saw a turnover of 4.5 million ringgit (1.165

<HEADLINE> China Readjusts Tax on Imported Equipment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to provide
more preferential terms for foreign and domestic companies,
including tax exemptions for imported equipment, as of January 1,
1998.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said
that related imported equipment will be used for projects
encouraged by the State.
</P>
<P>
The goal of tax readjustments, initiated by the State Council,
is to attract increasing foreign investment, encourage the import
of more advanced foreign technology and equipment, enhance the
adjustment of the industrial structure and technological
advancement, and maintain rapid, sound and sustainable national
economic development, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the preferential terms cover tax exemptions for
imported equipment for internal use by enterprises listed in the
directory for foreign-funded industries, and encourage foreign
companies to invest in high-tech industries, infrastructure and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Domestic projects, provided they are in industries which the
State has prioritized for development, will also receive tax
exemptions for imported equipment for self-use, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Domestic projects funded with loans from international
financial institutions or with foreign government loans will
receive more extensive preferential terms than projects using
domestic funding, including the same terms foreign-funded projects
receive for imported equipment if they are located in central and
west China, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to support the processing trade, increase
employment and expand exports, imported equipment, with the
exception of items listed on the compulsory tax list, will be
exempt from taxes.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the Customs department will release two lists on
December 31, one for foreign firms and the other for domestic
firms. The lists will outline imported commodities subject to tax
levies.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the goal for levying taxes on some imported
commodities is to discourage the importation of low-technology
machinery and equipment which can be built in sufficient
amounts domestically, and to protect fledgling domestic
industries still under development.
</P>
<P>
The list for foreign-funded projects covers taxable items with
levies lower than projects using domestic investment, in order to
ensure that foreign investors have a greater leeway in purchasing
equipment. The goal is to attract more foreign investment and
promote national economic development, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
This is the common practice pursued by developing nations, said
Wu, adding that projects involving domestic investment should use
more domestically manufactured products with guaranteed supplies.
</P>
<P>
She cited the following areas in which foreign investment is
encouraged:
</P>
<P>
-- fields related to new agricultural technology, as well as
the comprehensive development of agriculture, energy, transport
and important raw materials:
</P>
<P>
-- advanced and high technology and new equipment and
materials, which can improve the functions of products, conserve
energy and raw materials, enhance the economic and technological
efficiency and economic returns of businesses, and which cater to
the needs of the market, especially items with an inadequate
production capacity in China;
</P>
<P>
-- sectors that meet the needs of the international market,
upgrade products, open up new markets and increase exports;

<P>
The minister also cited the following projects using domestic
investment which are encouraged by the state:
</P>
<P>
-- those which currently meet and will continue to meet market
needs for the foreseeable future, and those with bright
development prospects;
</P>
<P>
-- those which have a high technological content, help to renew
equipment and accelerate the technological upgrading of
traditional industries, optimize and upgrade China's industrial
structure, and improve the overall economic returns;
</P>
<P>
-- those which China has the technological potential to
develop and which will fill in the gap in industry and
technology, and which help create new economic growth areas;
</P>
<P>
-- those which comply with China's sustainable development
strategy, and which will help to conserve resources and raw materials,
and which are conducive to ecological and environmental
protection; and
</P>
<P>
-- those which will increase China's supply capacity.
</P>
<P>
Wu explained that the undertaker of a project involving
domestic investment should handle with a local custom office the
procedures for tax exemptions on imported equipment for self-use,
on the strength of a "confirmation certificate" issued by related
government departments which have approved his feasibility
study report.
</P>
<P>
With regard to foreign-funded projects, procedures for the
exemption of taxes on imported equipment should be handled with a
local customs office, on the strength of the "confirmation
certificate," a business license and documents that approve the
establishment of a foreign-funded enterprise.
</P>
<P>
A company undertaking processing trade that imports
non-evaluated equipment provided by an overseas company should
handle with a local customs office the procedures for import duty
exemptions, on the strength of an approved processing trade
contract.
</P>
<P>
The term "confirmation certificate" refers to documents that
require projects to conform to requirements on the two lists.
</P>
<P>
Wu said foreign-funded enterprises will enjoy preferential
treatment immediately after they complete importing equipment and
raw materials for self-use approved for exemptions from tariffs
and value-added taxes prior to March 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Equipment imported for technological upgrading projects
approved prior to March 31, 1996, will be exempted from taxation
starting from January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Other projects, with the exception of those included on the
compulsory lists, will be exempted from taxation from January 1,
1998. These include foreign-funded projects and projects involving
domestic investment approved between April 1, 1996 and December
31, 1997, as well as those receiving approval to import equipment
with foreign government loans and loans from international
financial institutions between January 1, 1995 and December 31,

<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa hopes to expand
its cooperation with China, especially on international issues,
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed... that our cooperation in international
questions should be raised to higher levels," Nzo told a joint
press conference with Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen after the signing of a joint communique to establish
diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said: "South Africa and China are not only going to realize
a steady growth in our bilateral relations, but we shall endeavor
as two countries to contribute as much as possible in
international relations, in defense of humanity against possible
catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
Nzo said he held important discussions with Qian, which laid a
firm basis for further cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that South Africa's African National Congress had
close relationship with China and the Chinese Communist Party
even before South Africa's democratic transformation.
</P>
<P>
Nzo announced that South Africa has appointed Chris Dlamini as
its first ambassador to China. Dlamini is currently Chief of the
South African Center for Chinese Studies in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said he has accepted an invitation from Qian to visit China
and that he is looking forward for such a visit.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Chinese President Jiang Zemin would be able to
visit South Africa "in a not too distant future."
</P>
<P>
He said bilateral trade had already been very active before
the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries will reach 1.6 billion U.S.
Dollars by the end of the year, Nzo said, adding that it is a
very firm beginning, which gives hopes that trade relations will
be further developed to benefit the two peoples.

<HEADLINE> China Making Changes in Border Inspection Troop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The State Council has decided
to transform the system of military service among China's border
inspectors into a professional group on a trial basis in hopes of
increasing competence and stability.
</P>
<P>
Both the recently established border inspection general
stations in Beijing and Shenzhen and general stations which will
be set up in the cities of Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Zhuhai,
Shantou, Xiamen and Haikou before June of 1998, are expected to be
placed under the control of the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the ministry said the border inspection
troop inspects and supervises personnel and transportation coming
in and out of ports opened to foreigners, and they shoulder the
important mission of safeguarding state sovereignty and security.
</P>
<P>
The deepening of reforms, the rapid development of the national
economy, the increasing number of personnel and transportation
means coming in and out of ports opened to foreigners, together
with the rising number of illicit migration all combine to
emphasize the need for a highly competent professional troop.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that the establishment of a professional
troop would be conducive to carrying out the central government's
policies and orders and promoting exchanges between China and the
rest of the world.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Holds Condolence Service for Air Crash Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong called on all Singaporeans to be strong and live
tomorrow bravely on Tuesday at a national condolence service for
the 104 victims of the crashed SilkAir flight MI185.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the Prime Minister said, "Singapore is a small
place and a close-knit community. When a tragedy happens with a
loss of lives, it saddens the whole nation."
</P>
<P>
But, "We have to be strong. Life must go on from here, however
difficult it may be. The families must over time step out from the
sudden darkness in their lives. SilkAir must fly again with
confidence, and the country must emerge with fortitude from this
shared grief," he said.
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 people, including diplomats from the countries and
regions of the non-Singaporean victims on board flight MI185,
attended the service. Of the 104 victims, 58 were from Indonesia,
Malaysia, the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Japan,
Bosnia, Austria, Australia, India, New Zealand, and Taiwan. The
other 46 were Singaporeans.
</P>
<P>
SilkAir is a Singapore Airlines subsidiary which specializes in
regional flights. Its flight MI185 crashed into the Musi River
near Palembang, Indonesia, en route from Jakarta back to Singapore
on December 19, killing all the 97 passengers and seven crew
members on board.
</P>
<P>
After the condolence service, held in the Singapore Indoor
Stadium, was over, Singaporeans continued to come and laid flowers
and wreaths outside the Stadium for victims of the crash, the
first ever happened in the civil aviation history of Singapore.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- As the new year draws near,
Guo Dongpo, director of the Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs
under the State Council, extended warm regards to overseas Chinese
and called on them to contribute more to the country's
reunification and revitalization.
</P>
<P>
In his new year's message delivered today, Guo said two major
historic events occurred in 1997: Hong Kong's return to the
motherland and the successful 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people, adhering to the Deng Xiaoping Theory and
led by the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the center,
are pushing the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics
toward the 21st century, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
Over the long haul, patriotic overseas Chinese have played a
key role in promoting friendliness, cooperation and exchange
between China and the countries in which they live, and have
advanced the peaceful reunification of the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's development and prosperity are indispensable from the
care and support from overseas compatriots, and the active
participation by those who return from abroad, the director said.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs will continue to serve
and care for both Chinese living abroad and those who return, and
protect their legal rights and interests, he said.

<HEADLINE> Transport Sector Sees Fiercer Competition in 1997 (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tong told Xinhua the Ministry of Railways will take measures to
improve service. For instance, a computerized ticketing network is
scheduled to cover all the big railway stations on major lines by
the end of 1998. Besides, the ministry will be involved in the
building of new railways. By the end of this century, another
2,000 km railway lines will go into operation.
</P>
<P>
But the Ministry of Communications says that the length of
operational highways will increase 40,000 km in the next few
years. The Civil Aviation Administration of China also plans to
add more than 100 airliners over the period.
</P>
<P>
Li Dongming, a transport expert with the Ministry of
Communications, noted that all the means of transport have great
potential for expansion.
</P>
<P>
He noted that national economy and social development will
bring the passenger transport turnover to 17.5 billion person
times by the year 2000, representing an annual growth of more than
eight percent.
</P>
<P>
"The transport sector should follow the steps of economic
growth, and the competition among different means of
transportation will improve market operation," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The expert stressed the status of railway is "irreplaceable",
and said that it is reasonable only when railway transport makes
up at least 45 percent of the market shares.

<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China's trains carried a total
of 916 million travelers in 1997, a decrease of 2.8 percent from
that of last year, which means another setback for China's railway
transport.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of travelers transported through highway
rose by 3.4 percent to reach 11.6 billion, and that of air
travelers, up 10.4 percent, to stand at 59 million, said an
official from transport departments under the Ministry of Railways
today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over the decade from 1987 to 1996, the
market shares of railway, highway, and civil aviation have changed
from 54, 39, 3 percent to 39, 51, and 8 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to boost the sluggish railway transport
business, the Ministry of Railways started a nationwide move to
raise the speed of trains on April 1 this year. On some trunk
lines linking up such large cities as Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou and Harbin, the train speed reached 140 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
Train's national average speed, however, still stands at over
60 kilometers per hour, far below the international normal
standard, said Tong Anyan, deputy director of the ministry's
Department of Transport.
</P>
<P>
And it is known to all that the service from Chinese train
attendants were far from "satisfactory" for a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more travelers still turned to air or bus for
their faster or more comfortable service.
</P>
<P>
Transport competition mainly lies between railway and highway,
as most people cannot afford air travel, though the means is most
ideal. Statistics show that by now, only 20 percent of the air
travelers are at their own expense.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Rules out Civil Trial of Coup Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Suspects of Nigeria's foiled
coup bid announced last week would not be tried in civil courts
despite calls from some people and such countries as Britain and
the United States, according to a state administrator.
</P>
<P>
Although justice would be done, the nature of military trials
was something subject to adjudication, said Navy Commander
Anthony Onyearugbulem, Administrator of Ondo State, south
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"Military justice system has its own technicalities and its
way of doing things," the navy commander told a group of
traditional rulers Monday.
</P>
<P>
He restated that the crackdown on coup suspects had no tribal
or ethnic undertone, although some people were "trying to
ethnicize it".
</P>
<P>
"The best thing to do right now is to watch and pray that
mercy would prevail," he said, quoted by the Guardian newspaper
today.
</P>
<P>
Noting that no amount of newspaper write-ups or commentaries
would stop the military from taking military action on the issue,
the commander warned that meddling by civilians in a matter they
"know nothing about" would only complicate matters.
</P>
<P>
The remarks of the navy commander coincided with an
announcement of the military Monday that a 12-man special panel
had been set up to ascertain the involvement of those arrested
over the December 21 coup plot.
</P>
<P>
The country's number two person, chief of general staff
Lt.-gen. Oladipo Diya and 11 others are being held for the coup
attempt, which the head of state general Sani Abacha said would
erase the gains of his administration and destroyed the country's
external image, had it succeeded.
</P>
<P>
The special panel, made of members drawn from the army, navy,
air force, police and the state security service, has one month
to complete its investigation on the basis of the just concluded
preliminary investigation.
</P>
<P>
In the military, all cases, including alleged coups, are first
handled through preliminary investigations, followed by further
investigations by a special board.
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, the case is transferred to a general court martial
or a special military tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Some human rights and interests groups have called on the
military government to bring the case of coup plot to open and
fair trial. The demand is echoed by such countries as Britain and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the show of solidarity with the government has been
continuing in some places of the country, providing opportunities
to state administrators and other officials to reaffirm that the
botched coup attempt is real.
</P>
<P>
According to Information and Culture Minister Chief Ikedeasi
Mokelu, the government is in control of the situation in the
country and the alleged coup plot will not affect the
government's determination to hand over the civil rule by October
next year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Abuja Sunday, the minister appealed
to Nigerians to remain calm, confident and committed.

<HEADLINE> Voting Continues in Kenya with High Turn-out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of
Kenyans have to cast their ballots today after poor organization
forced an unexpected one-day extension of the country's second
multi-party general elections due to end Monday.
</P>
<P>
Despite common complaints, Kenyans show impressive and serious
enthusiasm for choosing leaders who they believe can be the best
to head the country into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Turn-out of voters were reportedly high across Kenya with long
queues each formed by hundreds of people seen outside numerous
polling stations.
</P>
<P>
In Kisii in southwestern Kenya, voters came to polling
stations as early as 5:00 this morning and many of them had even
camped overnight outside polling stations, said local media
reports.
</P>
<P>
In Mombasa, the capital city of Coast Province, a 30-minute
downpour drenched voters queuing patiently Monday morning, but
none took shelter.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of voters went out Monday even before daybreak and
had waited for hours before their turn.
</P>
<P>
Order and peace were seen during the exercise at most polling
stations, said sources from the Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
But unconfirmed local reports said today that two to three
people were killed with dozens injured on the election day
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Transport difficulties caused by bad weather, mixed ballot
papers, missing electors names from registers, lack of ballot
papers and other technical problems also caused delays, chaos and
tension nationwide in the elections, local media said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 9,031,141 registered Kenyan voters were expected to
to elect one president, 210 parliamentary members and 2,955 local
councillors for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Pre-elections opinion polls show that President Daniel arap
Moi, 73 and in power for 19 years, would take the first place
with votes ranging from 40.2 percent to 49.2 percent, almost
doubling his closest challenger Mwai Kibaki, the Democratic Party
Chairman.
</P>
<P>
Under Kenya's law, the winning presidential candidate must
garner the highest total and collect at least 25 percent of the
votes in at least five of Kenya's eight provinces.
</P>
<P>
There are 883 candidates from 23 parties running for the
parliamentary seats while 8,446 for civic positions.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Attempts to Create "Two Chinas" Doomed to Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of
Sino-South African diplomatic relations once again testifies to
the fact that any attempt by Taiwan authorities to create "two
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" is unpopular and runs counter
to the historical trend.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning existing "diplomatic
relations" between Taiwan and some countries, Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said there "is no way out for the
elastic and pragmatic diplomacy" pursued by Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted, however, that some African countries still maintain
"diplomatic relations" with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He urged said countries to remain alert to any political
attempts and "clearly understand the nature of attempts by Taiwan
authorities." He noted they should proceed in the fundamental
interests of their people, and make wise decisions at an early
date.
</P>
<P>
Tang pointed out that China and African countries belong to the
developing world, share similiar historical experiences in terms
of suffering, and are faced with the common task of building their
respective countries.
</P>
<P>
No conflicts exist in terms the fundamental interests of China
and Africa, but both do share extensive common interests,
according to Tang. He added that China has always cherished
friendship with African countries and is willing to develop normal
relations and cooperation with all African nations.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities have tried very hard to spread "pragmatic
diplomacy" in the international community in recent years, and
they have, in fact, used temporary economic difficulties in some
African countries to establish or rebuild "diplomatic ties" under
the guise of providing economic assistance, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The true intent of Taiwan authorities is not to help African
countries, but instead to use economic means to undermine
traditional friendship between China and the African nations, he
said, adding that Taiwan buys diplomatic recognition, attempts to
create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" and splits its own
country," said Tang.

<HEADLINE> India Draws Policy to Develop Inland Waterways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 30 (Xinhua)-- The government is drawing a
blueprint to substantially increase goods traffic through inland
waterways and a policy on private participation in the sector will
be finalized soon, said Surface Transport Secretary Yogendra
Narain here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 13th annual general meeting of the Overseas
Construction Council of India (OCCI), he said that the government
is considering to adopt regulatory measures to promote movement of
fertilizers, coal, cement, crude oil and petroleum products, and
steel through this mode and decongest the traffic by road and
rail. So far three national waterways are in the process of being
developed. The inland waterways sector would be handling about 20
million tones of freight by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
The government is targeting to double port capacity in India to
handle 424 million tones by the end of the Ninth Five Year plan
period (1998-2002) from the present 214 million tones. A number of
measures to augment port capacity and improve efficiency through
joint ventures between major ports and private sector are on the
anvil, he said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Coming mostly from Turkey and Iraq, 835 Kurds arrived on a
boat last Saturday in Italy for transition to Germany and Nordic
countries, where most of them have relatives. Their trip started
in Istanbul in the European consulates and then at the ticket desk
of the mafias specialized in "meat on foot," who charged 20,000 to
40,000 (3,300 to 6,600 U.S. dollars) for the trafficking of each
person. European authorities are afraid of more migration of the
Kurds, trapped in the war between the Turkish army and the PKK
guerrillas, which has resulted in the death of 25,000 people.
</P>
<P>
-- According to a document in the archive of the French army,
the Vichy collaboration regime of France during World War II had
ordered the internment of all Jewish soldiers serving in the
French army in North Africa, notably Algeria, deprived them of
their French nationality and sent them to southern Algeria to
build railways and other infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French government is studying a project to encourage
African immigrants to use their savings as productive investments
in their home country and ask French enterperises in Africa to use
their private fund in favor of aid projects for African countries,
as a way to check emigration to France. The government has also
found that the "aid for return" distributed to illegal immigrants
when they are returned home has not worked as an efficient way to
stop emigration.
</P>
<P>
-- The European consortium Airbus Industrie was approaching its
goal of obtaining half of world airspace market by winning 451
orders, as compared with 572 by the Boeing, in 1997, the best
result in its history. These orders amount to 185-190 billion
francs (32-33 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
weakened after gold prices slipped Monday.
</P>
<P>
Also, traders cited end-of-year book-squaring by participants
on the last full day of trading for 1997 as adding to the markets'
slightly negative tone.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 65.48 US cents, down from 65.78
late Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gold in Sydney closed at 291.10 US dollars per fine ounce, down
from 293.70 US dollars Monday.
</P>
<P>
Traders also said an illiquid market in holiday mode before the
New Year break was more susceptible to swings in value.
</P>
<P>
St George Bank Manager of Foreign Exchange Trading Stuart Moore
said thin volumes moved the Australian dollar further than normal,
as traders moved to square up their end of year positions.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank chief economist Craig James said the
Australian dollar was likely to be mired around 0.6500 US dollars
to 0.6700 dollars for a number of months given the poor outlook
for the Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
James said the Asian crisis acted as a "double whammy" for
Australia, impacting severely on exports to the region and world
commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
He said over the past four months the Australian dollar had
fallen just over 12 percent against the American dollar, while
commodity prices had dropped almost 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"How much of a surprise is the Australian dollar at 65 US cents
when gold is just above 18 year lows, copper prices are at four
year lows, oil prices are near 2 year lows and aluminum prices are
near 12 month lows," James said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the session at 85.05 yen, from
85.56 Monday, and at 1.1706 marks, from 1.1651.

<HEADLINE> New Budget to Reflate Nigerian Economy, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's newly-inauguarated
cabinet is in its second-day deliberations on the 1998 budget
today for expected ratification by the supreme provisional ruling
council tomorrow, the Vanguard reported.
</P>
<P>
Henceforth, the new budget will be announced not later than
January 3, said National Planning Minister Chief Ayo Ogunlade at
the end of the five-hour cabinet meeting in the capital Abuja
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the thrust of the budget will include
consolidating gains, reflating the economy, increase in capacity
utilization of industry, easy import of goods by manufacturers
and attractive atmosphere for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
While the salaries of public servants will be increased, the
budget will also affect the generality of Nigerians for
confidence building, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister hinted that the government was poised to scrap
the dual exchange rate, noting that "the mistake we have been
making is that there are two exchange rates, whereas the 22 naira
to the dollar is merely an accounting and a book keeping
strategy".
</P>
<P>
But he did not explain why it has been so.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the macroeconomic success, the minister said the
economy had been turned around from 103 billion naira deficit
recorded in December 1993 to 36 billion naira surplus last year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that inflation rate had also dropped from 77.8
percent in January 1995 to below 10 percent currently.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Finance Minister Chief Anthony Ani promised that the
new budget would be read on December 31.
</P>
<P>
If the budget is released on or before January 3, it would be
the earliest time that the government will unveil the budget.
</P>
<P>
This year's budget was read on January 18. Last year, it was ready
much later, and ditto the 1995 and 1994 budgets.

<P>
SINGAPORE, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
fell lower on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index lost another 3.11 points to close at 1514.83
points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that share prices declined on thin turnover and
weak sentiment arising from the second round of interest rate
hikes in a month by key banks here.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the rate increases dealt another blow to the
property sector. And dealers added that investors were
accumulating U.S. dollar denominated stocks, largely seen as
defensive.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased to 151.47 million units,
valued at 174.57 million Singapore dollars (104.53 million US
dollars). Advances overwhelmed declines by 239 to 99, while 271
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
MBf Capital was the most actively traded counter as it
registered a turnover of 13.69 million units. It was followed by
RHB Capital Warrant99 which had 10.16 million units traded. Malaya
Resources was next with 5.83 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Foreign led the gainers of
the day as it rose by 70 cents to finish at 21.5 Singapore
dollars. The Singapore Airlines (SIA) Foreign and SPH increased by
50 cents each to end at 10.8 and 17.3 Singapore dollars
respectively. Malaya Banking 200 picked up by 42 cents to close at
4.6 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Sino-South African Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and South African
governments will sign a series of bilateral agreements following
the establishment of diplomatic ties on January 1, 1998, in order
to promote the development of the economic cooperation and trade
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The agreements will guarantee trade between the two
countries," Tang Guoqiang, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign
Ministry, said at today's regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will also encourage businesses in the
two countries to initiate various forms of cooperation and explore
potential avenues for cooperation in wide-ranging fields,
according to Tang.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Sino-South African economic cooperation and trade
will witness great advancement following the establishment of
diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
China, the largest developing country in the world, and South
Africa, the most developed country in Africa, have their own
features and experience in economic development, as well as in
science, technology and culture, said Tang, adding that the two
countries can learn from each other.
</P>
<P>
China can supply South Africa with food products, edible oil,
machinery and electronics products, building materials, steel,
telecommunications equipment and chemicals, and South Africa's
abundant mineral resources can cater to market demand in China,
said Tang.
</P>
<P>
"Practice over the past several years have proved the
complementary aspects of the economies of China and South Africa,"
according to Tang.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is China's largest trade partner in Africa, with
the trade volume between the two growing to 1.3 billion US dollars
in 1996 from only 10 million US dollars in 1992. The 1997 volume
is expected to reach 1.6 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Congo Republic to Resume Dialogue With Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- New ambassador of France to
the Congo Republic, Herve Bolot, urged Tuesday the government of
General Denis Sassou Nguesso to resume dialogue with donor
countries on aid programs, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Bolot, who presented the credentials to Sassou Nguesso on
Monday, told AFP that France is ready to support Brazzaville in
its "effort of dialogue."
</P>
<P>
The toppled president of Congo, Pascal Lissouba, had concluded
an agreement with donor countries on economic structural
readjustment, whose implementation was interrupted by a five-month
civil conflict between the forces of Lissouba and Sassou Nguesso.
</P>
<P>
During a private visit to Paris last week, Sassou Nguesso
talked with President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin on issues of financial aid by France and the normalization
of political situation in his country through a presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
But Brazzaville has not publicly announced its need for
financial aid to reconstruct the country following the war, in
which between 4,000 and 10,000 people were killed and the capital
Brazzaville seriously damaged.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue its All-Round Diplomacy Next Year: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to carry
out its independent foreign policy of peace in an all-round way
next year in accordance with the diplomatic thoughts of late
leader Deng Xiaoping and the strategic policy outlined at the 15th
National Conference of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Tang Guoqiang made the remarks at a
press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said China's foreign policy next year will serve to create a
long-term, sound international environment for the country's
socialist modernization program, a good neighboring environment in
particular, and to maintain world peace and promote joint
development.
</P>
<P>
China will implement the outcome of the China-ASEAN informal
summit and intensify the China-ASEAN good-neighborly and
mutual-trust partnership oriented towards the 21st century. China
will also enhance its unity and cooperation with the countries in
Africa, Latin America, south Asia, and central and east Europe and
strive to establish a just and rational international political
and economic order, Tang noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will work still harder to implement the
outcome of President Jiang Zemin's trip to the United States and
do a good job in receiving President Clinton's upcoming China
visit, so as to further advance Sino-US relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will give full scope to the the role of the regular
meeting mechanism between the prime ministers of China and Russia
in an effort to further increase Sino-Russian cooperation in every
field, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the next year is the 20th anniversary of
the signing of Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship and
both sides will continue conducting high-level exchange of visits.
</P>
<P>
The momentum of high-level exchange of visits between China and
Western European countries will also be maintained, Tang noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China will continue to actively participate in the
multilateral diplomacy and play a constructive role in the issues
like the UN reform, regional conflicts, peace-keeping,
disarmament, arms control and environment protection, he stated.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue carrying out the policy of `one country, two
systems', maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, do
well the preparatory work for Macao's return to the motherland,
resolutely safeguard China's independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity and advance the great cause of the
reunification of our motherland," the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli industrial imports and exports rose in
October and November, the Jerusalem Post today quoted a report of
the Central Statistics Bureau as reporting.
</P>
<P>
In November alone, industrial imports rose 16 percent and
industrial exports, excluding diamonds, rose 7 percent, similar to
the increases in September and October, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli agricultural revenues will register a 26
percent drop for the whole year of 1997 to 1.6 billion shekels
(457 million U.S. dollars), latest official figures show.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry said this is compared to the 20
percent fall in 1996. It attributed the drop to several factors,
including a drought in the South that damaged the fields as well
as the damage fruit crops sustained in the North.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The investment in Israel's infrastructure in the
next five years will amount to 15 billion U.S. dollars, according
to a report of the Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted some Israeli economists as saying that more
than half of the sum would be invested in developing the
electricity infrastructure. And investments in transportation are
expected to total 3.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT -- The Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OAPEC) has predicted that the world demand for oil
would increase by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) next year.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of a monthly bulletin of the OAPEC estimated
that world demand for oil in 1998 in developing countries would
increase by 1.2 million bpd to reach 21.9 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Oil demand among the industrial countries would also increase
by about half a million bpd next year and in the central Asian
countries, by about 100,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has regained its
position as the No. 1 oil supplier to Japan in November, after
briefly yielding the position to Saudi Arabia in October.
</P>
<P>
Japan imported roughly 6.54 million kiloliters of crude oil
from the UAE last month, up 12 percent from 5.84 million
kiloliters in October, latest official figures show.
</P>
<P>
Japan's crude oil imports from Saudi Arabia amounted to 4.95
million kiloliters in November, down 24.5 percent from 6.56
million kiloliters the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources in UAE's oil sector said that the UAE is
expected to step up its sales drives to Japan after the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided to
raise the group's production to 27.5 million bpd at its latest
conference held in Indonesia between November 26 and December 1.
</P>
<P>
As a major OPEC member, the UAE raised its quota from some 2.3
million bpd to 2.5 million bpd.

<HEADLINE> Ramadan Starts In Egypt Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today kicked off the
Islamic Holy month of fasting with a full-range of cultural and
religious festivities as well as public care for the needy.
</P>
<P>
The sighting of the Crescent, which determines the start of
Ramadan, was announced Monday night by Farid Mohammed Wasel,
Egypt's mufti, the country's highest Islamic religious authority.
</P>
<P>
A number of Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar,
Bahrain, Yemen and Lebanon also declared that Ramadan began from
today, according to the Middle East News Agency. But Iraq said it
will observe the holy month from Wednesday according to the
emergence of the crescent.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar year, observed
as sacred with abstaining from food, drink, smoke and sex from
dawn to dusk. It is the month when Koran, the Islamic holy book,
was revealed to Prophet Mohammed 1,400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim fasting month has special importance for the one
billion Muslims worldwide not only because of its religious
importance but also because it includes the largest amount of
religious, cultural and even artistic activities.
</P>
<P>
Apart from short working hours, Cairo streets and public
districts in Ramadan can be another attractive item with
glittering festoons and lamps hanging on the shop-fronts and swarms
of people enjoying charity food in open air.
</P>
<P>
Religious seminars, cultural soirees and folk art performances
will be held during the month in different state-owned theaters
and palaces of culture. They will attract large audiences.
</P>
<P>
This year, the Opera House in Cairo, responsible for art
performance during the holy month, has decided to hold a series of
religious lectures and host folk art troupes and music ensembles
from other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The majority of students, however, will not be able to fully
enjoy the festivities of the Ramadan as it coincides with mid-term
exams at schools and universities.
</P>
<P>
Along with the many cultural and entertainment activities, many
people are already relishing the prospect of having an Iftar, the
breakfast ending a day's fasting at sunset and a Sorour, the
banquet before sunrise.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan is also the time for the poor and the unfortunate to
enjoy charity food as the rich and public institutions set up
their charity meal stalls throughout the country during the month.
</P>
<P>
To spice up the atmosphere of festivity and encourage shopping,
the government has decided to move ahead to mid-January the spring
sales season, which used to come after Ramadan.

<HEADLINE> Stamps Commemorating Diana to Be Issued in U.K. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- British Royal Mail stamps
commemorating Diana, Princess of Wales, are to go on sale at the
beginning of February.
</P>
<P>
The Post Office said Tuesday it would release more than 120
million sets of the stamps on February 3 and all the profit,
expected to be over 7 million pounds (11.7 million U.S. dollars),
would be donated to the memorial fund in Diana's name.
</P>
<P>
The five first-class postage stamps feature photographs of
Diana ranging from the regal princess wearing a tiara to more
recent casual poses.
</P>
<P>
Diana's family had been reluctant for stamps to go on sale
immediately after her death on August 31, thus delaying the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Post Office expects an unprecedented demand from the public
as well as collectors all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Several other countries have already issued stamps to
commemorate Diana.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Hong Kong Stands Test of Asian Financial Storm (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A few months after returning
to China, Hong Kong was confronted with a regional currency
turmoil but has so far seemed to be able to weather the regional
instability.
</P>
<P>
As international speculation triggered falling dominoes among
Asian currencies over the past few months, the peg between the
Hong Kong dollar and the greenback has stood firm at one
U.S. dollar to 7.8 HK dollars, the benchmark set in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a wave of speculative attacks on the local currency,
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government
resolved to defend the link and, with resources and skill, has
succeeded in fending off the speculators.
</P>
<P>
The government's strong fiscal position has made Hong Kong
well-positioned against external shocks. The city with a
population of 6.3 million has the world's third largest foreign
reserves, measured at 91.8 billion U.S. dollars at the end of
October. It has no single cent of foreign debt thanks to a prudent
fiscal policy, which restrains the growth of government
expenditure well below the GDP (gross domestic product) growth.
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the peg was kept with a price. Overnight interbank
lending rate at one moment hit 300 percent in reaction to
speculative attacks in late October, and the jacked-up three-month
rate is now still hovering around 10 percent, putting strains on
all borrowers.
</P>
<P>
"In keeping the peg, merits outweigh demerits," said Professor
Y.C. Jao at the School of Economics and Finance, University of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The short-term pain caused by higher interest rates, most
notably the plunges in stock and property prices, was the lesser
of the two evils, compared with financial uncertainty and loss of
confidence that could be triggered by the disassociation of the
link, he argued.
</P>
<P>
Despite the predicted shrinking profits as a result of soaring
interest rates in the last quarter of 1997, Hong Kong's banking
sector remains healthy and well-capitalized. The capital adequacy
ratio for locally-incorporated banks stood impressively at 17.8
percent, far exceeding the 8 percent statutory requirement under
the Basic Capital Rules to be one of the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
A minor run on the International Bank of Asia in early November
was quenched in a day or two, demonstrative the high liquidity
levels held by local banks have made them well prepared for a
sudden wave of customer withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), which has consistently
kept a close watch on the banking system, began in early November
to step up its inspection of local banks on a daily basis to
ensure it is able to react rapidly to any financial jitters.
</P>
<P>
In December, the Washington-based think-tank Heritage
Foundation confirmed in its study that "Hong Kong is a world
banking center and one of the world's most stable banking
environment."

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Hong Kong Stands Test of Asian Financial Storm (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an increasingly integrated global financial market, Hong
Kong is not immune from the regional currency turmoil, which
originated in Thailand in early July, spilled over to other
Southeast Asian economies, and recently spread to the Republic of
Korea (ROK) and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index, the barometer which traces the performance
of 33 blue-chips listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK),
plummeted 1,211 points on October 23, the biggest single-day point
loss in history. Riding on the roller-coaster, Hong Kong stock
prices went down from a peak of 16,673 points in August to around
the 10,000-point level these days.
</P>
<P>
Against the depressing scene, Edgar Cheng, former chairman of
the SEHK, still saw the underlying strength. He said: "One
noteworthy aspect is that our market systems have withstood
dramatic swings in stock prices and heavy trading volume without
any sign of strain."
</P>
<P>
In late October when all major stock markets around the globe
experienced sharp falls, the Hong Kong market remained firmly
open and continued to operate in an orderly manner, reflecting its
state of maturity.
</P>
<P>
In his view, the recent market turmoil would neither alter the
long-term trend of increasing investment in Asia by global
investors, nor reduce the huge demand for capital by Asian
economies, especially China which is determined to reform its
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent financial uncertainty, Hong Kong for the
fourth year in a row was rated by the Heritage Foundation as the
freest economy in the world.
</P>
<P>
With little government interference in the marketplace and a
high degree of economic freedom, Hong Kong not only tops the
foundation's scoreboard of 156 economies across the world, but has
a remarkable ability to weather tough times.
</P>
<P>
David Dodwell, co-author of the influential book "Hong Kong
Advantage", said: "It (the Asian financial turmoil) is a valuable
test of the strength of Hong Kong. Hong Kong has very effectively,
efficiently mediated the challenges that swept over it through
October."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Hong Kong's intrinsic strength lies in its
immense flexibility and a wide spectrum of economic activities and
markets.
</P>
<P>
Dodwell believed that a quick adaptation to the changing
environment has helped and will continue to help Hong Kong recover
rapidly in the wake of crisis.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Hong kong is luckily placed to have good strong
business links with the Chinese mainland to give it an extra area
of business activities to keep the economy robust, he added.
</P>
<P>
As Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Special Administrative
Region (SAR) put it in Vancouver last month, Hong Kong, given its
sound fundamentals, robust monetary and banking systems, huge
foreign reserves, flexibility and resilience in coping with
external shocks, would be the first economy to rebound after the
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Plans to Reshuffle PNA Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat has promised to reshuffle
the PNA cabinet in the near future, Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center (JMCC) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen PNA cabinet ministers, including Agriculture Minister
Abdul Jawad Saleh, submitted their resignations to Arafat on
August 1 this years. And Arafat has not made his final decision on
the cabinet reshuffle till now, JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was quoted as saying Monday that the Authority would
function as a transition government for another month and a half,
pending a reshuffle of portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also agreed to set up a committee to include Fatah (main
stream Faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization) members to
discuss the reshuffle, it said.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts between the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) and
the PNA Executive Authority have been intensified
recently. Several PLC members openly accused some cabinet
ministers of having both a poor performance of work and records of
corruptions.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the PLC's session was adjourned after some of its
members warned to introduce a no-confidence motion against the
cabinet if the Executive Authority did not not approve laws
adopted by the PLC.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Arafat held an urgent meeting in Ramallah with the
Fatah PLC members and discussed the relation between the PLC and
the Executive Authority.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Arafat stressed that the present government
is a temporary one and that he intends to make some cabinet
changes in the near future, probably after his return from his
meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington next month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat also instructed the PNA legislation department
to speed up the preparations on a number of legislations for
his approval, as part of the PNA plan for administrative
reforms.

<HEADLINE> Sino-South African Relations Reach A Milestone (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of
diplomatic relations between China and South Africa represents a
milestone in bilateral relations, according to a senior Chinese
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
China's Assistant Foreign Minister Ji Peiding made the
statement during a recent interview with Xinhua News Agency and
China Central Television.
</P>
<P>
Ji said the establishment of diplomatic ties would enhance
solidarity and cooperation between China and nations in southern
Africa, as well as other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of Sino-South African diplomatic relations is
of great significance, and friendship and cooperation between the
two countries will enter a new period of development, said Ji.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the establishment of Sino-South African diplomatic
relations will further reinforce solidarity and cooperation
between developing countries, and will at the same time promote
world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Ji noted that the establishment of diplomatic relations between
the two countries once again proves that attempts by Taiwan
authorities to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" are
unpopular and run counter to world sentiment. Their "elastic and
pragmatic diplomacy" is doomed to failure, added Ji.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China and South Africa today
signed a joint communique, agreeing to establish diplomatic
relations at ambassadorial level as from January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed in Pretoria by Chinese Vice-Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo.
</P>
<P>
"The Government of the People's Republic of China and the
Government of the Republic of South Africa, in conformity with
the interests and desire of the two peoples, have decided upon
mutual recognition and the establishment of diplomatic relations
at ambassadorial level as from January 1, 1998," the communique
reads.
</P>
<P>
"The Government of the Republic of South Africa recognizes
that there is but one China in the world, the Government of the
People's Republic of China is the sole legal government
representing the whole of China, and recognizes China's position
that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China."
</P>
<P>
The two governments also agreed to exchange ambassadors as
soon as possible, and to develop friendly relations and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela said after talks with
Qian in Cape Town Monday that it was in the interests of South
Africa to have diplomatic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived in South Africa Sunday for a five-day
official visit, has met National Assembly Speaker Frene Ginwala
and Tokyo Sexwale, premier of Gauteng Province.
</P>
<P>
Qian is also scheduled to open the Chinese Embassy in Pretoria
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela declared in November 1996 that his country would sever
ties with Taiwan and establish diplomatic relations with the
People's Republic of China by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
China and South Africa established study centers in each
other's capitals in February 1992 under agreements reached in
November 1991.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries witnessed rapid growth in
recent years with the bilateral trade in 1996 jumping to 1.35
billion U.S. Dollars from mere 14 million dollars in 1991. It is
expected to exceed 1.5 billion dollars this year.

<P>
Ji said that Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen's ongoing official visit to South Africa, which commenced
on December 28, represents a major event in the bilateral
relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said the joint communique signed by the two sides on the
establishment of diplomatic relations has completed the legal
procedures for the normalization of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian's visit will include wide-ranging exchanges of view with
South African leaders on the further development of bilateral
relations and other issues of common concern, Ji said, adding that
the two nations will also sign a number of cooperative agreements.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Qian's visit will deepen mutual understanding and
friendship, and will usher in a new chapter of friendship and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ji said that the formal establishment of diplomatic relations
will create conditions necessary for high-level exchange
visits. "We believe the two sides will engage in more exchanges,
including more high-level exchange of visits between the two
countries," said Ji.

<P>
Addressing the question why China and South Africa failed to
establish diplomatic relations for such a long period of time, Ji
noted that the Chinese government and people have firmly supported
the people of South Africa in their struggle for racial equality
and have, in turn, sealed a time-honored friendship. He also
pointed to the fact that people in South Africa have deep feelings
for Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two countries did not establish diplomatic
relations soon after the birth of the new South Africa because of
that nation's "diplomatic relations" with Taiwan which was left
over from the period of apartheid. The government of the new South
Africa needed time to deal with said relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government expressed understanding that the
government of the new South Africa required some time to readjust
its relations with China, said Ji.
</P>
<P>
Ji referred to factors which promoted the establishment of
diplomatic relations by noting that China is the largest
developing country in the world and a permanent member of the
United Nations Security Council, while South Africa is one of the
largest nations in Africa and an important member in the group of
developing countries and the nonaligned movement.
</P>
<P>
The two countries witnessed the same historical suffering and
face similar tasks, said Ji, adding that broad prospects exist for
bilateral political, diplomatic, economic, trade, scientific and
technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the two countries should engage in close
consultations in major international and regional issues. "These
are major factors which have promoted the establishment of
diplomatic relations," noted Ji.

<P>
With regard to bilateral economic and trade cooperation, Ji
said that unofficial economic and trade relations between the two
countries have developed rapidly in recent years, despite the lack
of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the bilateral trade volume for 1991 stood at 14
million US dollars, with the figure soaring to 1.34 billion US
dollars in 1996. This year's trade volume is expected to reach
1.6 billion US dollars, said Ji, adding that Chinese enterprises
have invested more than 100 million US dollars in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ji pointed to the fact that the two nations share highly
complimentary economies which offer vast potential for bilateral
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ji also noted that companies and enterprises in the two
countries are keenly interested in economic and trade cooperation,
and are rapidly expanding direct links.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of diplomatic relations will provide
further political guarantees for bilateral economic and trade
exchanges. Ji also noted that the Chinese government will
encourage financially sound Chinese enterprises to invest in South
Africa and engage in mutually beneficial cooperation. He added
that the prospects for bilateral economic and trade cooperation
will expand even further with the establishment of diplomatic
ties.

<P>
Ji noted that China and South Africa are developing countries
which share many fundamental interests and play important roles in
their respective regions.
</P>
<P>
He noted the two nations have identical viewpoints on many
major international issues, and added that strengthening bilateral
consultations and cooperation in international affairs will enable
them to play an even greater role on international arena and
safeguard the legal rights and interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The two economies have different characteristics and respective
advantages in terms of resources, said Ji. However, historical
factors limited exchanges and resulted in a lack of mutual
understanding.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of diplomatic relations will enable China and
South Africa to learn from each other in their respective nation
reconstruction, said Ji.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, according to Ji, the normalization of relations
will serve the fundamental interests of the two peoples, and will
further promote the development of friendship and cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ji said that promotion of solidarity and cooperation between
China and African nations, as well as developing countries as a
whole, represents an important part of China's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
China is fully prepared to work with African nations to develop
a long-term and stable Sino-African relationship based on
all-round cooperation and oriented toward the 21st century, said
Ji.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the fact that South Africa, an important nation
on the African continent, works to promote regional peace and
development and plays an active role in both African and
international affairs. He added that South Africa currently chairs
both the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and
the Southern African Development Community, and will chair the
nonaligned movement in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ji said the normalization of relations between the two
countries will usher in a new chapter of bilateral relations and
will promote unity and cooperation between China and African
nations, as well as developing countries as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, according to Ji, the strengthening of solidarity
and cooperation amongst developing countries will give a powerful
push to the formation of a multi-polar world.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economy Presses Ahead in 1997 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy has drawn
the world attention with its favorable growth momentum in 1997, in
sharp contrast to the dim future for other emerging Asian
economies plagued by financial storms.
</P>
<P>
Its superb performance has won almost unanimous high praise,
either in the analytical reports of international authoritative
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), or
from ranking officials of other countries.
</P>
<P>
This provided a solid basis for a general and consistent
confidence in China's future, despite the death early this year of
Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of the country's reform and
opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that China registered an economic growth
rate of 8.8 percent this year, with the inflation rate dropped to
0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists hailed it as a miracle that the Chinese government
could achieve high economic growth in tandem with such low
inflation, as the Chinese economy was plagued by a runaway
inflation of 21.7 percent just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the overheated economy has since steadily cooled down,
as a result of the nation's effective control measures over real
estate speculations, the top blame for the "bubble economy".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thanks to the proposition and guidances of President
Jiang Zemin and other senior leaders, disputes calmed down and the
consensus was reached to boldly utilize management mode and form
of assets ownership, including the joint-stock form, that complies
with the law of what guiding social production.
</P>
<P>
As an immediate outcome, China's state-owned enterprise reform
entered upon a new era: the pace for merging, acquisition and
restructuring of the large- and medium-sized state firms are
reported to have accelerated over recent months.
</P>
<P>
And the total profits from the state-owned sector is expected
to post double-digit annual growth this year over 1996, although
it still takes time for the sector to move out of the financial
dilemma, according to officials with the State Economic and Trade
Commission.

<TEXT>
<P>
In analyzing the prospects for China's economic growth,
economists referred to its huge market potential and growing
export demand as the two other factors that props the Chinese
economy.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Dam, as the world's largest water conservation
scheme, best indicated the infinite market opportunities in
China. With an estimated cost of a total of 200 billion yuan upon
completion in 2009, it already induced a group of multinationals
to vie with each other for the project's international orders.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 70 percent of the equipment used in the
project have been purchased overseas.
</P>
<P>
China's efforts to reduce its foreign trade barrier also won
the acclamation from the international community. Following the
recent slash of the tariff level to 17 percent in October, China
committed itself to further tariff reduction up to the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
All these have contributed greatly to a general optimism of the
international investors toward the nation's economic future. China
is estimated to have drawn record 62 billion US dollars in direct
foreign investment this year, against the backdrop of investment
withdrawal from some Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
As for the export traders, they posted a trade surplus of about
40 billion US dollars this year, despite the mounting pressure
from the currency depreciation of other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, along with a steadily increasing foreign exchange
reserve, the Renminbi steadily gained value against the greenback
this year, indicating the steady manner the Chinese government has
adopted in the course of its opening-up.
</P>
<P>
As the IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus has noted, it is
impressive that the Chinese can keep a fast economic growth while
avoiding economic instability, and attract foreign investment in
large quantities.
</P>
<P>
His view was echoed by Bill Gates, the Microsoft Executive
General during his recent fifth visit to China, who pointed to the
the nation's infinite market opportunities and expressed his fully
confidence in further increasing cooperations with the country.

<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited normalization
of relations between China and South Africa was realized today in
Pretoria, South Africa, when the foreign ministers of the two
countries signed a joint communique on full diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
The event, an important link in the chain of China's diplomatic
activities, took place during Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen's ongoing visit to South Africa, and completes China's
diplomatic agenda for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the establishment of diplomatic
relations between the two nations marks a new beginning of
development in bilateral ties, and will have a positive impact on
expanding cooperation between China and African countries and
other developing countries, as well as on establishing a fair and
reasonable new international economic and political order.
</P>
<P>
They also point to the fact that forging diplomatic relations
between the two countries will promote the exchange of views
and consultations between the two countries on African affairs,
and will promote stability and development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela announced at the end of
1996 that his country would sever "diplomatic relations" with
Taiwan and establish full diplomatic ties with the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that South Africa's "diplomatic recognition" of Taiwan
is not compatible with the role his country plays in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the two countries have since engaged in
frequent exchange visits to work for the establishment of
diplomatic relations. Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Ji
Peiding visited South Africa earler this year, and South African
Vice-Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad visited China in June.
</P>
<P>
Qian and his South African counterpart Alfred Nzo met at the
United Nations headquarters in New York in September and reached a
consensus on issues related to the normalization of diplomatic
relations.

<P>
Senior South African leaders have on many occassions reiterated
that the decision to establish diplomatic relations with China is
irreversible and an inevitable choice of the South African
government.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Nzo rejected Taiwan's unreasonable requests
for negotiating future Taiwan-South Africa ties.
</P>
<P>
Nzo stated that Taiwan requests to retain its "symbols, flag
and name" and its three "consulates" in South Africa after the two
sides severed diplomatic relations do not comply with the
international law and are "untenable."
</P>
<P>
Yang Lihua, a research fellow with the Center for Southern
African Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told
Xinhua that the establishment of China-South Africa relations is
not only based on extensive and important common interests the two
sides share, but also on evaluations the two nations have made
with an eye to their future development prospects.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who has visited South Africa four times, said the
establishment of diplomatic relations represents a "common need of
both sides."
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who relinquished his ANC presidency to his successor
during the recent 50th National Congress of the South African
National Congress (ANC), noted that one of the major achievements
of the South African government over the past three years has been
to settle the issue of normalizing relations with the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
China is the largest developing country and South Africa is the
most developed nation in Africa. Differences in terms of
resources, and industrial and consumption structures point to the
complimentary nature of their economies.
</P>
<P>
China and South Africa are important trade partners, and the
two countries share enormous potential for cooperation in
high-tech sectors such as space, aviation and electronics, as well
as in other areas including the exploration, mining,
metallurgy, construction, energy and finance.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in South Africa's Business Day, the
annual trade volume between South Africa and China including Hong
Kong tops three billion US dollars, a level much higher than the
level with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the industrial and business community in
South Africa firmly support the government decision to establish
diplomatic relations with China at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
She noted that business, academic and cultural communities in
South Africa have shown an increasing interest in China and are
ready to increase exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the consistent support of the Chinese government
and people to South African people in their just struggle against
apartheid, particularly their moral and material assistance
to the ANC in the crucial period in the 1980s, has helped to
accelerate the process of normalizing relations between the two
nations.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Japan to Boost Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Japan
have agreed to step up efforts to boost bilateral economic
cooperation, Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) reported today from Riyadh,
the capital of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the two countries agreed to sign an investment
protection agreement during the current visit by Japanese Minister
of International Trade and Industry Horiuchi Mitsuo in Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Saudi and Japanese officials have also
succeeded in expanding "scope of understanding" and have become
more convinced of the necessity to establish a full partnership in
the economic, investment, trade, technological and technical
fields by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese minister, who arrived in Riyadh Friday, called on
Saudi Arabia to increase its participation in industrial projects
in his country, while Saudi officials expressed hope that Japan
will increase import of Saudi oil and launch joint projects in the
oil and minerals fields.
</P>
<P>
Japan currently imports 1.2 million barrels of oil per day from
Saudi Arabia and is expecting to increase the importation to 2.15
million barrels.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and exporter, is
Japan's second largest oil supplier after the United Arab
Emirates. Saudi government expressed hope to Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto when he visited Riyadh in November that
Japan will increase oil imports from the world top oil producer.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese minister also conveyed a letter from Hashimoto to
King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz of Saudi Arabia on the willingness to
promote bilateral relations, Kuna said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi sources were quoted as saying that Saudi
Arabia was looking forward to a larger cooperation convenient to
the capabilities of both states.
</P>
<P>
They said Riyadh wants Japan to expand its investments in the
Gulf state beyond the petrochemical industry, which constitutes
the core of Japan's 1.5 billion U.S. dollars investments in the
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has been complaining that Japanese investment in
the Kingdom has not been commensurate with Japan's economic
strength.

<HEADLINE> Russia Advocating Free Economic Zone in CIS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia is advocating the
establishment of a free economic zone in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) area.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Cooperation with CIS Countries Anatoly Adamishin
said here Monday that this would be helpful in further promoting
the integration of CIS member nations.
</P>
<P>
Adamishin, as quoted by an Interfax news agency report, said
Russia's volume of trade with other CIS members has continued to
be on the downward slope in this out-going year.
</P>
<P>
The decline, he said, is related not only to economic problems
existing in the CIS community, but also to the fact that some of
the CIS nations levy a surtax on imports from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Trade among CIS nations could grow only if they achieve
economic stability and resolve their disputes over indirect
taxation, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the proposed free economic zone, Adamishin said the project
will lay an indispensable common ground for all CIS nations to
carry out their individual goals and to integrate the CIS.
</P>
<P>
While advocating the CIS integration, Russia is not against
diversity in the process toward that end, he said.
</P>
<P>
The integration of Russia and Belarus, and the tax union of
Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrkyzstan are real examples of
the preserved diversity, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Backs Bid to End Hardships of Iraqi People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait backs any bid to
end the hardships of the Iraqi people and does not object to Arab
delegations' visit to Iraq for humanitarian purposes, a senior
Kuwaiti official has said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency today quoted Kuwaiti Information Minister
Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah as saying after taking part in a
meeting of Kuwaiti parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee that
"we have no problem with the Iraqi people, but our dispute with
the regime in Iraq is still standing."
</P>
<P>
In response to a call for dialogue by an Iraqi newspaper to
resolve the Iraqi-Kuwaiti differences, Sheikh Saud said "the
Iraqi regime understands that the stand of Kuwait is explicit in
this regard, as it has been a stance agreed upon at the
government and popular levels."
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that "Kuwait does not oppose to the dispatch of
Arab or foreign delegations to Iraq for humanitarian purposes to
end the hardships of the Iraqi people and offer medicines and food
with approval of the international sanctions committee of the
United Nations."
</P>
<P>
But the minister said earlier this month after the three-day
Gulf Cooperation Council summit here that Kuwait was ready for an
Arab reconciliation based on clear understanding, but ruled out
reconciliation with the Iraqi regime.
</P>
<P>
He warned against confusion in this respect as "our position
toward the Iraqi regime is out of the reconciliation issue as it
is not a Kuwaiti but an international cause."
</P>
<P>
The two countries severed diplomatic relations after Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 which sparked off the 1991 Gulf
War. The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq in 1990 for its invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
So far, the prisoners of war and other issues have still
hindered the improvement of ties between Kuwait and Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' New Police Chief Vows to Fight Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Newly-installed Police Director
General Santiago Alino has vowed to fight big kidnapping
syndicates in the Philippines, particularly in Metro Manila, the
Philippine News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Alino took oath as chief of the Philippine National Police
(PNP) together with 14 other newly promoted police generals before
President Fidel Ramos in the Presidential Palace Monday night.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, Alino said that he would give top priority
in solving the pestering kidnapping problem that has given the
country a bad image abroad, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The intensified campaign against kidnappers will be
relentlessly pursued as his pet project in 1998, Alino was quoted
as saying, adding that aside from cracking down on kidnappers, the
PNP will also check other heinous crimes on a nationwide scale.
</P>
<P>
The PNP's failure to arrest kidnappings in the past few months
has caught the fire of the public. Former PNP chief Recaredo
Sarmiento was forced to quit from his post earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos has ordered the PNP and other law enforcement
agencies to intensify their drive against kidnapping incidents
through the safe recovery of victims and the capture of
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least three kidnapping cases are taking
place every week in the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Tel Aviv Exchange Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The value of foreign
investments on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) has fallen 2
billion shekels (570 million U.S. dollars) since June this year,
the Bank of Israel said in a report published today.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that in October alone, the value of foreign
investments in the TASE fell 5 percent to 18.2 billion shekels
(5.2 billion dollars) from 19.2 billion shekels (5.8 billion
dollars) in September.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the drop mainly to the decline in the value of
shares traded on the stock market. This was due to the crisis
which affected all the world's stock exchanges following the
financial upheavals in the capital markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the foreign investors' proportion of
the total shares traded on the TASE fell to 12.6 percent in
October from 12.8 percent in July. But this is still slightly
higher than the proportion in December 1996, which stood at 11.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The report added that the general public held 71.7 percent of
the shares traded on the TASE in October, compared to 71.2
percent in July.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Britain Reshaping Its Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain, that had been deeply
engrossed in isolating itself from other European nations and some
world organizations, is busy improving its international image by
promoting its influence in Europe and even in the world arena.
</P>
<P>
The remarkable adjustment of the British foreign policy started
in May when the new Labor government came to power after winning a
landslide victory of the general election.
</P>
<P>
The first major action taken by the Labor government was to
mend Britain's fences with its European Union (EU) allies, which
had been battered by the non-cooperation policy pursued by the
previous Conservative government.
</P>
<P>
Only days after his assumption of office, British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook pledged in a statement "to seize the
opportunity to shape the direction of Europe and make the United
Kingdom a leading player in Europe."
</P>
<P>
To match warm words with actions, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair visited some major EU countries and announced to sign the
EU's "Social Chapter," which showed his determination to break
away from the Conservative's opt-out policy.
</P>
<P>
Despite ruling out Britain's first-wave membership of the
European Monetary Union (EMU), the Blair government sang a
positive tune by saying it would constructively use Britain's EU
rotating presidency next year to strive to make the single
European currency a success.
</P>
<P>
Political commentators said that the "charm offensive" launched
by the Labor government has not only transformed to some extent
the UK-EU confrontation into cooperation but enhanced Britain's
efforts to push the European integration process forward in the
UK-favored direction.
</P>
<P>
Apart from working hard in Europe, the Blair government is set
to reinforce Britain's international status. Addressing the annual
banquet of Lord Mayor of London last month, Blair vowed to make
Britain "pivot of this new world."
</P>
<P>
"With our historic alliances, we can be pivot. We can be
powerful in our influence and make British influence in the world
felt," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Britain took steps in resuming its seat at some
international organizations, such as the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the
Pacific Community, in a bid to promote its influence in the whole
world.
</P>
<P>
Britain revoked a previous Conservative government's decision
to withdraw from the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in
Edinburgh in October, Britain made painstaking efforts to
revitalize the Commonwealth, hoping to play a leading role in the
54-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government also attached great importance to its
relations with countries in Asia-Pacific, the most economically
dynamic region in the next century, especially the UK-China ties.
</P>
<P>
The smooth handover of Hong Hong on July 1 paved the way for
enhancing Sino-British relations. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has
reaffirmed that Hong Kong should be "a bridge" rather than a
barrier in the development of UK-China relations.
</P>
<P>
Britain's new Ambassador to China Anthony Galsworthy told
Xinhua that the successful handover of Hong Kong has provided "a
real good opportunity" to promote Sino-British relations.
</P>
<P>
Cook's visits to Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the
Philippines, India and Pakistan this year further intensified
Britain's efforts to gain economic interests in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain surely does not forget to forge closer links
with its traditional ally, the United States, which is another
priority in its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Within one month of Blair's election victory, U.S. President
Bill Clinton visited London and became the first foreign leader to
address the Downing Street Cabinet in the past 28 years.
</P>
<P>
During the stand-off between the United Nations and Iraq over
weapon inspection, London was the only staunch American ally in
taking a non-concession tough line.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here believe that the Labor government,
having made an impressive start in its foreign policy adjustment,
would inevitably meet a number of challenges, particularly in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
It is likely that Britain would fail to achieve its ambition to
become a leading player in the EU mainly due to its decision not
to join the EMU in five years, which is a key project in the
development of the EU in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
And, Britain's future influence and status in Europe as well as
in the world will mainly depend on what kind of role it can play
in the European Union.

<HEADLINE> China to Adopt SCDMA Telecom Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China has made progress in the
telecommunications research of adopting new technology to connect
switchboards with telephone users without wire.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts of China's Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, the new technology called as SCDMA
(synchronous code division multiplex access) system will save some
100 billion yuan annually in laying cables for telephone networks.
</P>
<P>
They said that the technology is two or three years ahead of
the current telecom development in the world's telecommunications
sector.
</P>
<P>
The SCDMA system is one of the key scientific research program
included in China's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and it is
convenient to operate in rural areas and urban suburbs, as well
as in small- and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
Since August this year, the system has been tried out in seven
cities including Chongqing and Chengdu in Southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the system has recently passed the assessment
and will be put into production soon.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Moves to Modernize in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIANYUNGANG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The northern part of east
China's Jiangsu Province has developed its modern agriculture
rapidly by exploiting agricultural resources and developing
international markets.
</P>
<P>
Experts cited the area's modern agriculture as a major driving
force in promoting development of the local economy. The
industrial output of rural enterprises has stood at more than 20
percent of the provincial total, according to local statistics.
</P>
<P>
The area -- including the five cities of Xuzhou, Lianyungang,
Huaiyin, Yancheng and Suqian -- has set up approximately 1,000
agricultural enterprises, each involving more than 10 million yuan
(1.25 million U.S. dollars) in annual sales. Of these enterprises,
more than 100 have annual sales of 50 million yuan (6.25 million
U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Tapping its abundant agricultural resources, the cities have
set up large centers for planting and processing vegetables,
aquatic products, starch, cotton, grain and wood.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, agricultural centers have been built and extended to
the country's 16 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 500 joint ventures, cooperative enterprises
and wholely overseas-funded companies have been set up in the area
to exploit agricultural resources and process farm and sideline
products. They have used more than 200 million U.S. dollars in
overseas investment and forged cooperative ties with large-size
agricultural enterprises in the United States, the Republic of
Korea (ROK), Japan and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Exports of farm and sideline products have made up over 60
percent of the area's total exports in recent years. And the
area's vegetables and chickens are sold in over 40 countries and
regions around the world.

<HEADLINE> Good Policies Key to Good Harvest of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China's grain output this year
will be about the same as in 1996 and cotton output will exceed
last year's level, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Farmer's per-capita net income will rise, after allowing for
inflation, by four percent over 1996's 1,926 yuan (232 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Many reasons have contributed to the achievements, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
First, the central government has always put agriculture,
especially grain production, at the top of its agenda.
</P>
<P>
At the Central Economic Conference held early this month,
agriculture was ranked as the key factor for maintaining the
economic momentum of "high growth with low inflation".
</P>
<P>
To ensure a rise in farmers' income after the bumper summer
harvest of nearly 124 million tons, the central government fixed a
protective grain purchasing price higher than the price offered by
private grain traders.
</P>
<P>
A special risk fund for grain purchase was established to
allocate adequate funds to State grain reserve centers.
</P>
<P>
Grain reserve centers were required to purchase all the grain
farmers wanted to sell. No purchasing prices below the protective
price would be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Second, a huge investment in agriculture infrastructure has
guaranteed a good harvest. This year, farmers have experienced the
most serious drought since 1970. The water shortage has plagued
most areas north of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water Resources said the drought affected more
than 33 million hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the drought, the central government invested 32.2
billion yuan (3.9 billion US dollars) in irrigation networks and
other agro-facilities. Without the investment, the paper said, it
would be very hard to maintain the present level of crop harvests.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology are the third factor accounting for good
crops. The Seeds Project -- a campaign to cultivate, process and
sow selected excellent strains on a uniform basis -- was launched
nationwide in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Agrotechnical stations at all levels have also helped
increase the contribution of science and technology to higher
grain output by popularizing simple and practical farming
techniques among farmers.
</P>
<P>
Finally, agro-industrialization has made a remarkable
contribution to agricultural development. Township-owned
enterprises have acted as the leading force in the process of
agro-industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Although China has witnessed three successive years of good
harvests, there is no solid basis for the conclusion that China's
grain problem has been solved once and for all, the paper pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
The growth in China's grain output is held back by "the
bottleneck of backward agro-techniques" and "the lack of a sound
grain distribution system," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, limited storage facilities and transportation
capacity will eventually limit the amount of reserves, it added.
</P>
<P>
How to stimulate farmers' incentive to produce and sell more
grain is an important quandary for policy-makers, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Bridge Players Banned for Cheating with Pager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Three players have been
suspended for cheating using a cellular phone and a pager during a
competition in September, the Chinese Bridge Association said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Tong of the Zhongjian Bridge Club in Beijing was banned
from the sport for five years, while Shi Zhengjun and Zhang Wenli,
both from the same club, suspended for three years, the
association said.
</P>
<P>
The trio were found cheating in the team-of-four event during
the 1997 National Bridge Tournament, said the competition's
Referee Committee chief He Jianguo.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that Shi asked Zhang to call to pass vital card
information to Jiang through the paging service after Shi
completed his competition in the open room.
</P>
<P>
Jiang then knew the cards beforehand from his pager when he was
competing in the closed room, He said.

<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China's gross domestic product
will reach 7,477.2 billion yuan this year, a rise of 8.8 percent
over last year, said Ye Zhen, spokesman for the State Statistics
Bureau, here today.
</P>
<P>
"The year 1997 witnesses China consolidating its achievements
in a soft landing for the national economy and making further
obvious progress in the overall economic control," commented Ye at
a press conference.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Chinese economy grew 9.7 percent over 1995. As the
Chinese economic growth slows down, inflation in China is also
slipping lower.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's consumer price index and retails price
index are estimated to rise by 2.8 percent and 0.8 percent
respectively this year over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector is estimated to grow by 3.5 percent
this year, while the manufacturing and service sectors
by 10.8 percent and 8.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates put China's grain output at 492.5 million
tons this year, the second year of bumper harvest in China's
history. Meanwhile, cotton output is to increase by 100,000 tons
to reach 4.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
China's rape seeds output suffered a decrease of one million
tons to 21 million tons this year, as compared with last
year.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Calls on Filipinos to Rekindle Heroes' Spirit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos Tuesday called on the 70 million Filipinos to rekindle the
"selfless courage, sacrifice and vision" that national hero Jose
Rizal and his fellow martyrs bequeathed to the Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Addressing on the 101th death anniversary of Rizal, Ramos said
it is important that "we reflect on Rizal's role in the collective
works, sacrifice and patriotic fervor exemplified by our heroes
and heroines during the crucial period of the revolutionary
struggle against the colonial government of Spain."
</P>
<P>
He said that one certain way of enabling the Filipino people to
imbibe the ideals and values of the heroes was by preserving the
sites and homes that stood as silent witnesses to their charting
the path to glory.
</P>
<P>
"Those shrines do not just commemorate the relevance they
played in our history but also serve as living centers of civic
consciousness and responsibility," he said after inaugurating the
newly rehabilitated Rizal Shrine at Fort Santiago in Intramuros,
Manila.
</P>
<P>
As a tribute to the patriots and unsung heroes who waged a
blazing trail to freedom from 1892 to 1898, the National
Centennial Commission set up four years ago has been busy in
developing and rehabilitating historical sites across the nation,
Ramos said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Develops World's 1st Prawn Gene Map: CSIRO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Australia's top
government-funded research body announced Tuesday it had developed
the world's first prawn gene map as the first step in helping
prawn farmers produce bigger and faster growing prawns.
</P>
<P>
The genetic linkage map, the first for any crustacean species,
will be used by researchers to identify the genes for traits
including growth rate, flesh quality and disease resistance.
</P>
<P>
"Using the map as a guide, large increases in the rate of
genetic improvement of farmed prawns are possible, compared with
those which can be made using traditional breeding strategies,"
the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization
(CSIRO) said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The early research by a team in Brisbane, capital of Queensland
state, was also designed to estimate the heritability of traits.
</P>
<P>
The success has prompted plans for CSIRO scientists to
collaborate with peers from the Australian Institute of Marine
Science to produce an international genetic linkage map for the
black tiger prawn in research also involving Thailand, China and
the United States.

<HEADLINE> White Pollution Being Curbed in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Beijing cleared up tons of
polystyrene food trays, plastic bags and other disposable cups and
boxes over the weekend with the help of some 300,000 volunteers
from across the capital.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 waste plastic bags and polystyrene trays were
collected by participants and the rubbish on an area of 50,000
square meters combed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The activity is part of this year's large-scale battle against
"white pollution" in the capital. Last Friday of every month is
set by the municipal government as City Clearance Day.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the practice," said a Beijing Environmental
Sanitation Bureau official. The battle against white pollution has
been a focus of the City Clearance activity in the past three
months and will still be so in the near future, the official added.
</P>
<P>
From the new year, plastic bags thinner than 0.015 millimeters
will be banned from the capital's market, and it is suggested that
people use home-made cloth bags instead of plastic ones.
</P>
<P>
Starting last June, six pilot companies have been operating in
the capital to retrieve polystyrene trays. It is estimated that by
the end of the year, 30 percent of the used trays will have been
retrieved and sent for recycling.
</P>
<P>
The environmental sanitation official said: "This is a good way
to curb pollution as well as to investigate the possibility of
recycling resources."

<HEADLINE> 37 More Kenyans Killed by Unknown Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A total of 37 Kenyans died of
an unknown disease in the past 24 hours in Wajir District,
bringing the death toll to more than 250 in the Northeastern
Province this month.
</P>
<P>
The disease, earlier diagnosed by experts as severe malaria,
is also wiping out thousands of livestock, including camels,
goats and sheep, in the province, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen of the deaths were in the worst-hit Sarif area where
nearly all the villagers were suffering from the disease, said a
provincial medical officer, Abdi Hassan, who just wound up a tour
to the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
A few victims who took anti-malaria and antibiotics recovered,
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the true identity and nature of the epidemic remains
a mystery. The victims diarrhoea, vomit and eventually bleed to
death.
</P>
<P>
Anthrax and yellow fever are also suspected to be the cause of
the death, the World Health Organization said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers are testing samples in laboratories to establish
the cause of the deaths, but the results are not yet known, said
the Geneva-based group.
</P>
<P>
However, initial tests ruled out Ebola fever. Ebola, which
leads to similar symptoms and kills through massive internal
haemorrhaging, was first identified in Sudan in 1970s.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Dr Paul Ndung'u, a veterinarian, attributed the
outbreak to sharing of water sources by people and livestock.
</P>
<P>
He said investigations conducted at the Karatina Veterinary
Investigations Laboratories indicated that the disease was caused
by pasteuvella organisms as a result of months of heavy rainfall.
</P>
<P>
The sick animals were responding positively to sulphadimine
and anti-histamines treatment, he said.

<P>
DHAKA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to expand the country's export market by diversifying
export items.
</P>
<P>
Besides its traditional export items such as raw jute and
garment, the government has decided to put on the export list such
non-traditional items as software, vegetables and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the National Export Committee chaired by Prime
Minister Sheik Hasina on Monday, participants decided to diversify
export items while laying emphasis on traditional export sectors,
a local newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"New entrepreneurs and new ideas should come in the export
sector," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"We may have a good market of these two items (vegetable and
jewelry) abroad, which will also help create employment
opportunities," she said.
</P>
<P>
The country has fixed its export target of 6 billion US dollars
for the current fiscal year beginning July 1, and earned 1.72
billion dollars from export during the first four months.

MOSCOW, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States is the sole
superpower in the world Monday but that does not mean that the
world is a U.S.-dominated monopolar world, Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the Cold War period, the United States provided nuclear
umbrella for the west but in the world today that protection is no
longer needed. So it is wrong to confuse the concept of superpower
with that of the monopolar, Primakov said in an interview with the
Russian newspaper Independent.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there remained differences between Russia and
the United States over issues in the Middle East. He said he hoped
the United States would adopt a more realistic attitude when
discussing those issues.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also denied that Russia has offered missile technology
to Iran, saying such a claim was made by the pro-Israel lobbies in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
He also said that some people in the United States were getting
angry when U.S. domination over the Middle East was broken by
other countries.
</P>
<P>
As for the application of the Baltic countries -- Lativia,
Estonia and Lithuania -- for membership of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), Primakov indicated Russia would not
make any concessions over the issue.
</P>
<P>
If the three countries are accepted by NATO as new members,
Russia will re-consider its relations with the military alliance,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he believed the Baltic countries should stay
neutral, which could guarantee their safety, rather than joining
NATO.

NEW DELHI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A chain of small hydel units

Development Program (UNDP) scheme to wean the local communities
away from their dependence on forest resources for energy needs,
the local economic newspaper Business Standard said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The local people's dependence on forest resources for energy
needs has proved to be a major cause for deforestation and
ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
Around 20 units are proposed to be set up under the scheme, to
be funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) which has
provided 25 million US dollars for the purpose. The scheme is
expected to be completed by 1999.
</P>
<P>
The project attains significance in view of the continued
resistance of the inhabitants to big dams, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavian Economy Improves in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The national economy of the
Yugoslav Federal Republic picked up in 1997 despite lack of
working funds and foreign financial support, a top statistician
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Milovan Zivkovic, director of the country's Statistics Bureau,
told reporters that gross social output of 1997 rose 7.4 percent
over that of the previous year, with industrial and agricultural
outputs going up by 9.6 percent and five percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia also managed to maintain the stability of commodity
prices and the exchange rate of its currency, the Dinar, and
thereby effectively harnessed inflation.
</P>
<P>
December prices were only 9.6 percent higher than the same
month of the previous year, the lowest price increase in 15 years
except for 1994.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the economy, people's living standards
also grew in real terms. Average monthly wages increased 21.5
percent to 806 Dinars (about 137.5 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Yugoslavia's per capita national income was 1,550
dollars, up from 1,250 dollars three years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Zivkovic said, it would take seven to eight years for
the country's per capita national income to return to the 1989
level of 2,850 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Adopts New Tariffs for Next 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Presidential
Palace has agreed the adoption of new tariff rates for imported
oil and petrochemical products for the next three years, local
press reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said a uniform duty of 3 percent would be imposed
on both crude and refined oil imports. The country's Supreme Court
earlier ruled "unconstitutional" a law levying a 3-percent tariff
on crude and 7 percent on refined oil products.
</P>
<P>
The uniform tariff will be retroactive to December 19.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Palace sources said the new rates would be
implemented even without the legislature's endorsement through an
executive order during the Congress' break in the coming holidays.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the oil tariffs, the Palace also approved a
7-percent duty on completely knocked down parts of cars and a
40-percent tariff on buildup units. The former will be raised to
10 percent by 1999 as the latter cut to 30 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
For petrochemical products, the reports said, the Palace
approved the imposition of a 10-percent duty on petrochemical
products and zero to 3 percent for monomers.
</P>
<P>
This means that local petrochemical producers will have to
improve their competitiveness to compete with petrochemical
imports. Industry players have not given up their opposition to
this new tariffs and have vowed to lobby further.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Palace also agreed to abolish duties on
many information technology products to comply with the country's
early commitment to the World Trade Organization, the reports
said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Sees 1st Current Account Surplus in 14 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand registered in October
its first current account surplus in 14 years, indicating hopes of
a turnaround in the economy, according to the Bangkok Post
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The current account surplus for October is estimated at around
500 million US dollars, the newspaper quotes Olarn Chaipravat,
chairman of the Thai Bankers' Association, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Olarn believed that in the last three months of the year, the
country could have a total surplus of about 2 billion dollars, a
strong positive sign for the overall economy.
</P>
<P>
The surplus shows that foreign exchange inflows from Thai
exports are higher than capital outflows for payments on imports
and foreign debt, signaling that monthly cashflow is beginning to
show a surplus after years of being in the red.
</P>
<P>
The cash outflow was reduced as a result of the rollover of
foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
However, Olarn warned, "we have already passed this year. But
we still have a heavy burden for next year."

COLOMBO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has agreed to provide 600,000 U.S. dollars to the Sri
Lanka-based Worldview International Foundation (WIF) for the
latter to produce video and radio programs on development issues
involving the poor, the official newspaper Daily News said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The non-governmental organization WIF will take the advantage
of the ADB fund to produce 52 video and 10 radio programs
featuring problems in the fields of education, health, population,
poverty reduction, women and children development and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the programs are aimed at improving the
disadvantaged people's awareness on those issues as well as
promoting their active participation in related development
projects.
</P>
<P>
The programs will also be used to inform the general public in
developing countries about the challenges and problems facing the
poor.
</P>
<P>
The WIF has already established its own educational network
Young Asia Television (YATV), which is broadcasting regularly in
Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
</P>

It plans to soon expand broadcasting to Cambodia, Malaysia,
Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Nigeria to Sign Gas Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Italy's national electricity
board, Enel, and the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas company will
sign an agreement Wednesday to sort out a gas supply dispute, Enel
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the two sides said the final agreement for the
supply of 3.5 billion cubic meters of liquefied Nigerian natural
gas starting in the fall of 1999 was based on preliminary set in
September.
</P>
<P>
Difficulties arose when Enel's attempts to build
regassification plant at Montalto di Castro on the coast near Rome
and at Monfalcone ran aground because of protests from grass-roots
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
The plants were needed for the Nigerian gas to be turned back
into the gaseous state for introduction into the national gas
grid. Failure to build them meant there was nowhere for the
Nigerian gas to go and could have meant Enel having to pay over
11.75 billion dollars under its 20-year take-or-pay contract with
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The compromise solution involves unloading the liquefied gas in
France where it will be regassified by Gaz de France under an
agreement signed a few days ago. Swap agreements between Enel and
Gas de France will bring an equivalent amount of gas to Italy
through an Italian terminal in the Austro-Slovakian border.

ROME, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Political stability is the key to

economy, Romiti said. Political stability is the number one item
for both Italy and Europe in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The watchwords for Italians in 1998 are "confidence and
courage", Romiti said. He elaborated: the Italians should have
"confidence in one's own abilities which are extraordinary and for
which all the world envies us", and the courage "to change" rather
than hanging on to the present.

WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Poultry giant Tyson Foods
Inc. agreed to pay six million U.S. dollars in fines and costs
after pleading guilty Monday to a federal charge it made illegal
gifts to former Agriculture Secretary, Mike Espy.
</P>
<P>
The Arkansas-based company was accused of providing Espy and

lodgings and other gifts.
</P>
<P>
Espy was indicted in August on charges he accepted gratuities

<P>
The Tyson agreement must still be approved by United States
District Judge Ricardo Urbina, who scheduled sentencing for
January 14, Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
As part of the plea bargaining, the company must institute
ethics training and other safeguards against future wrongdoing,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Espy and former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros are the
highest-ranking officials of the Clinton administration to be
accused of a crime.

said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today quoted him as saying that the three
-- Hendrobudiyanto, Paul Soetopo and Heru Soepraptomo -- were
undergoing intensive investigation on suspicion of corruption
involving a total of 1.5 trillion rupiah (300 million U.S.
dollars).

<P>
Hendrobudiyanto was director of private foreign exchange
supervision of the central bank, Soetopo was director of market
operations and Heru was director of legal affairs. The fourth man,
who was also dismissed from his post, Mansjurdin Nurdin was
director of supervision for private non-foreign exchange banks.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Foreign Exchange Reserve Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's foreign exchange
reserve reached a record 2.83 billion U.S. dollars by the end of
October this year, up 22.6 percent from 1996, the Central Bank
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange reserve is enough to support 5.6
months of imports, the bank said. Last year Sri Lanka held 2.3
billion dollars in foreign exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the increase to more capital inflows and
improvement in the current account of the balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
Capital inflows were mainly composed of foreign investments,
private proceeds and remittances by Sri Lankans abroad.
Remittances alone rose from last year's 34 billion Rupees (570
million dollars) to 38 billion Rupees (630 million dollars) by
September this year.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's trade deficit by the end of October stood at minus
60.7 billion Rupees (1.01 billion dollars), down from minus 62.8
billion Rupees (1.05 billion dollars) of the corresponding period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The decline was brought about by a 21.3 percent rise in exports
as against a 15 percent increase in imports, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew mainly in agricultural and industrial sectors,
particularly tea and garments, it added.

<HEADLINE> China's Machine Tools Imports Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Imports of machine tools
declined sharply this year, the first time in the past three
years, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Customs figures show the imports of metal-processing machine
tools hit 1.18 billion U.S. dollars by the end of November, down
35.4 percent from the same period last year. Machine tools exports
reached 253 million, up 12.8 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
"The cancellation of favorable tariff treatments on equipment
imported by foreign-funded ventures is one of the major reasons
for the drastic drop in imports, equal to about 648 million
U.S. dollars." Said Zheng Guowei, a member of the Science and
Technology Committee under the Ministry of Machine-Building
Industry.
</P>
<P>
The import tariff plus value-added tax on machine tools now
range from 25 percent to 40 percent of the actual value of the
equipment since the central government announced the restoration
of the tariffs on capital goods imported by foreign-invested
enterprises and some technical renovation projects.
</P>
<P>
Lower demand, primarily caused by the tight credit policy of
the central government, also contributed to the slump in imports
of machine tools, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
However, the future state of the industry would depend on the
extent of the tax breaks and exemptions the central government
plans for 1998.
</P>
<P>
A reliable source said, in a bid to encourage foreign direct
investment, China is to resume a favourable import tariff and tax
treatment for both foreign-funded ventures and State enterprises,
starting next year.
</P>
<P>
The market share of the State-owned machine tool manufacturers
is expected to expand due to the government's preferential scheme
to extend loans and to enterprises' increasing concentration on
quality improvement, product development and after-sales service.

<HEADLINE> Northern Huaihe River Emerges As Important Grain Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The northern area of the
Huaihe River, an emerging grain production center in east China's
Jiangsu Province, has played an increasingly important role in
boosting the province's grain production.
</P>
<P>
The area is part of the Huanghuaihai Plain created by the
Yellow River, China's second largest, the Huaihe River and the
Haihe River.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the area is expected to increase grain
production by 3.2 percent to 18.75 billion kilograms this year,
580 million kilograms more than the 1996 figure. The 1997 grain
output should account for 51 percent of the province's total
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The area, including 28 counties in northern Jiangsu, has
greatly improved its basic farming conditions and grain output
since the project to promote the all-around development of
agriculture was started 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
During the past 10 years, the area has invested 3.12 billion
yuan (390 million U.S. dollars) in building water conservation
facilities, transforming more than one million hectares of low-
and medium-yield fields and increasing irrigated land by 287,000
hectares.
</P>
<P>
To produce more high-yield farm products, the area introduced
improved varieties and new agricultural production technologies.
In the Huanghuaihai Plain, more than 95 percent of wheat is of
improved varieties. Statistics show that wheat output in some
counties and towns has exceeded 7,500 kilograms per
hectare.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Prime Minister Extols China Experience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko was so impressed on his recent trip to China that he
is sending experts to Shanghai to learn about setting up free
economic zones.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing his trip, Pustovoitenko said on Monday that political
harmony is essential for Ukraine's ailing economy to recover.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people's spectacular economic achievements reflect
the need for attaining political accord within the nation and
rallying all political forces around certain goals," Pustovoitenko
said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine had been haunted by squabbles between the executive and
legislature for years. Political infighting was believed to be a
major factor hindering the country's recovery from the worsening
economic recession.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed the importance of steady, clear-cut
and meaningful political and economic policies. He said: "China's
sober and predictable economic strategy makes the nation
attractive for foreign investors."
</P>
<P>
Besides praising his Chinese counterpart, Li Peng, for
channeling funds to promising and profitable enterprises,
Pustovoitenko said his visit to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange was
very instructive as to how to make Ukraine's stock exchanges
efficient, viable and booming.
</P>
<P>
"To make China's valuable experience of economic reforms
applicable and more adapted to Ukraine's realities, a Ukrainian
experts group will be sent to Shanghai shortly after the New Year
holidays," he said.
</P>
<P>
The group's mission would be to find out what should be done to
set up free economic zones in Ukraine.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Argentine soccer star Diego
Maradona is said to return to Italian Serie A side Napoli as a
player-manager, Italian news agency ANSA reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Neapolitan businessman and politician Nicola Rivelli is part of
a consortium hoping Maradona to be back to Napoli. Rivelli is
currently in talks with Napoli president Corrado Ferlaino for
buying the club.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that Diego has said...that he is ready
to return to Napoli and would do so once we have formalised our
offer to Ferlaino," said Rivelli, who was in Paris with Maradona's
representative Guillermo Coppola.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, who announced his retirement as a player two months
ago, was quoted as saying in Buenos Aires last week that he wanted
wide powers to try to bail out Napoli who are bottom of the
Italian first division.
</P>
<P>
Napoli completed a league and cup double in 1987, thanks
largely to Maradona's inspiration.
</P>
<P>
They went on to lift the UEFA Cup in 1989 and a second league
title in 1990 but have won nothing since the former Argentine
captain left the club in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Stoichkov Says Ronaldo Is Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Hristo Stoichkov, the Bulgarian
star striker at the 1994 World Cup, said he thought Brazil's
Ronaldo was the best soccer player in the world.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BTA, Stoichkov said Ronaldo, who was
signed by Inter Milan from Barcelona last summer and plays well in
Brazil's national team, has a strong, even performance.
</P>
<P>
"Ronaldo is one of the best players in the world now, or maybe
I should say the best," said Stoichkov, who won the Golden Shoe in
the World Cup finals in the United States in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said next year's World Cup finals in France would be a
tougher test for Bulgaria than the 1994 edition.
</P>
<P>
Stoichkov, who plays for Spainish club Barcelona, said in an
interview with BTA that his country must be better prepared but at
the same time not weighed down by the psychological burden.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian team must not be anxious because in the past few
years many of its players went abroad and gained experience, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We must not worry at all. The teams playing against us must do
all the worrying. After all, we are the world's fourth strongest
team," Stoichkov said.
</P>
<P>
Summing up his work in 1997, helping Bulgaria to win a berth in
France was the most important task for Stoichkov and he was happy
that Barcelona topped the Spanish league rankings after the first
half of the season.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I have had an operation in my career
followed by a slow recovery. But everything is just fine,"
Stoichkov said.
</P>
<P>
"There are few cups I have not won. In 1997 we won the Cup
Winners' Cup, Spain's Cup and Super Cup. The only cups that we
failed to lift were the UEFA Cup and the Inter-Continental Cup
which we lost in Tokyo some years ago," he said.

BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- About 2.2 million households
in the Chinese capital, or 90 percent of the city's total, have
used natural gas for cooking.
</P>
<P>
Beijing residents started to use natural gas for cooking in the

the residents, because residential construction in the city has
developed rapidly in recent years, with five million square meters

Last September, natural gas was piped into Beijing from Shaanxi

northwest China, improving the supply.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Beijing municipal government said that by the
year 2000, Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia will pipe into Beijing 700
million cubic meters of natural gas a year. Then, all the Beijing
households will use natural gas for cooking.

government's inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
He was the second cabinet member to quit in a week.
</P>
<P>
Former Foreign Minister and Minister of State Adrian Severin

<HEADLINE> Drinking and Driving among Young Drops in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The rate of drinking and
driving among younger drivers fell sharply in the United States
this year, a leading research firm has found.
</P>
<P>
It is now less than one-half the level of 1985, the
Illinois-based Insurance Research Council (IRC) said in a press
release today.
</P>
<P>
A survey based on in-house interviews with 1,966 drivers living
in the United States found that 18 percent of those aged 18-24
reported drinking and driving in 1997, compared to 29 percent in
1990 and 48 percent in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Among drivers aged 25-29 the rate of drinking and driving was
23 percent in 1997, against 36 percent in 1990 and 53 percent in
1985.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the American public supports tougher
drunk driver penalties.
</P>
<P>
Fifty one percent of respondents believe that the drunk
driver's license should be suspended or revoked when caught in an
accident even if there were no injuries.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of respondents favoring jail time goes up to 28
percent if the accident caused serious injuries.

<HEADLINE> FAA: Using Seat Belt Can Prevent Turbulent Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Most of injuries in
incidents of in-flight turbulence can be prevented if passengers
wear their seat belts whenever they are seated, the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) said today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that two passengers were killed and 63
seriously injured in 252 incidents of turbulence reported by major
U.S. air carries operating around the world between 1981 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
An average of 58 passengers are injured each year if minor
injuries are accounted. About 22 flight attendants are also injured
annually in turbulence, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said it has spent half a million U.S. dollars over
the past year on television, radio and print advertisements to
urge travelers to buckle up. But still many ignore the advice.
Even when pilots illuminate fasten seat belt signs, some people
still refuse to wear seat belts.
</P>
<P>
Air turbulence can occur unexpectedly, even when skies look
clear. So the FAA recommends that airline passengers wear seat
belts whenever they are seated, not just when fasten seat belt
signs are turned on.
</P>
<P>
Fasten seat belt signs were reportedly on for less than a
minute before sudden turbulence hit a United Airlines jet flying
between Narita, Japan, and Honolulu Sunday night, killing a woman
and injuring 102 other passengers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sales of Existing Homes Dip Slightly in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nation-wide sales
of existing homes declined slightly in November, but are finishing
1997 at a record pace, the National Association of Realtors
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 4.38 million units in November. That's just 0.2 percent
lower than October's 4.39 million rate, the highest level since
the group began tracking sales in 1968.
</P>
<P>
The association projected sales for all of 1997 will total 4.31
million units, also the best in 29 years, and forecast 4.09
million units would be sold in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The robust home sales have been enhanced by low mortgage rates
and strong economic growth, which pushed the nation's unemployment
rate to a 24-year low of 4.6 percent in November and produced the
strongest income growth in eight years.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.21 percent in
November, the lowest in 21 months. They fell to about 7.1 percent
this month as some investors fled Asian financial chaos for the
safety of U.S. government securities.
</P>
<P>
The strong sales this year are giving homeowners a dividend.
Home values are appreciating three times faster than the overall
inflation rate of about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The median price of an existing home was 124,400 U.S. dollars
in November, up 6 percent from a year ago. By region, sales fell
2.7 percent in the Midwest to a seasonally adjusted 1.09 million
units in November and 1.6 percent in the Northeast to a rate of
630,000 units. Sales were unchanged in the West at a rate of
990,000 units. They rose 1.8 percent in the South to 1.67 million
units.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief to Approve Iraqi Oil-for-Food Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of
the United Nations Kofi Annan would approve an Iraqi food and
medical distribution plan this week, UN spokesman Fred Eckhard
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Eckhard said the Iraqi Government
submitted the plan on Saturday to the UN representative in
Baghdad, and the papers are being forwarded to the UN Headquarters
in New York.
</P>
<P>
"We would hope that the package could be approved by the end of
this week," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the UN Resolution 986, which was adopted in
1995, Iraq can sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six
months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for
its people. The so-called oil-for-food plan is aimed to relief
effects of the sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait
1990.
</P>
<P>
The plan began last December and was renewed by the Security
Council of the United Nations on December 4.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq suspended oil exports on December 5 to protest delays
in receiving food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies. Iraq
said it would resume oil exports once Annan approves the current
six-month plan

<HEADLINE> US Watches Closely Trans-Iranian Pipeline Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States could not
impose sanctions on Turkmenistan for its new gas pipeline to Iran,
but it would be looking closely at any feasibility studies for a
proposed pipeline from Turkmenistan to Turkey via Iran, the State
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said the Iran-Libya
Sanctions Act (ILSA), signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996 to
impose sanctions on any companies investing more than 20 million
dollars in either Iran's or Libya's energy sections, could not be
imposed on the gas pipeline between Turkmenistan and Iran,
inaugurated today, because the construction of the pipeline
predated the act.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't trigger it," Foley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But the United States would not let off any other project of
trans-Iranian pipelines without scrutiny of their possible
violation of the U.S. law, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"We will examine carefully any new proposals for the
construction of trans-Iranian pipelines in light of the provisions
of ILSA. If any such project is found to involve sanctionable
activity, we will take appropriate action under the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States knew a feasibility study for the
proposed pipeline from Turkmenistan to Turkey via Iran was about
to go ahead after the three countries on Sunday gave the authority
to the Anglo-Dutch oil company Royal Dutch-Shell for that work.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States would "withhold judgment and see what
actually was involved if it moved to the stage of execution."
</P>
<P>
"The United States opposes as a matter of policy the
construction of pipelines across Iran," he said, explaining why
Washington would monitor the progress of the proposed
trans-Iranian pipeline.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Renews Call for Peacekeepers in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat today renewed a call for deploying international
peacekeepers in the West Bank to secure peace between Israel and
the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
According to Palestinian Radio today, Arafat said in Gaza that
under Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, international
peacekeeping forces should be deployed in the area, like those now
stationed in the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Arafat raised the proposal when meeting with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright in London on December 18. The Palestinian
National Authority on Saturday ratified this idea.
</P>
<P>
Arafat would set forth the proposal as part of his
comprehensive plan on the final settlement with the Israelis
during his coming talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton next
month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are to
meet separately with Clinton, who tries to mediate by himself in
an effort to advance the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has rejected Arafat's demand. Netanyahu's adviser
David Bar-Illan said Arafat's call was nothing new, and Israel
would not accept it.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Israel's rejection of his proposal, Arafat
reminded that "Israel may not keep wide tracts of the West Bank,
they must remember the agreements they signed."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government is debating the establishment of two
security zones along the Jordan River and 1949 armistice line,
which will be controlled by Israeli troops, to ensure its security
after the final settlement is reached with the Palestinians.
