Castro: Elian, Dad To Be Reunited
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro declared Wednesday night that it is
just matter of days before Elian Gonzalez will be reunited with his father. ''I
am talking about three days'' more or less, Castro told hundreds of university
students from across Latin American and the Caribbean in town for a regional
congress. ''It is inevitable.'' ''The battle of Elian has been won -- in
judicial terms, in legal terms, in political terms,'' Castro said. Castro's
statement came less than an hour after Gregory Craig, attorney for Elian's
father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, announced in Washington that the father would be
traveling to the United States Thursday with his wife, their 6-month-old son,
and with Fernando Remirez, chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington.

Iran Welcomes Albright's Remarks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's foreign minister on Wednesday welcomed a recent
overture by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as a start toward reversing
decades of mistrust, but said words needed to be supported by actions.
Albright's comments last month contained some positive points that shed light on
U.S.-Iranian relations, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said, according to the
official Islamic Republic News Agency. But he added other comments were
unwarranted.

House Passes 'Partial Birth' Abortion Ban
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a bi-partisan effort, the House voted 287-141 to pass a
ban on so-called ''partial birth'' abortions. The vote marks the third time in
five years the House has backed the ban. While the majority was wide enough to
override President Clinton's threatened veto, the bill's supporters appear to be
short of the strength they would need to prevail in the Senate. The vote came a
few weeks before the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on a ban of
such abortions passed by the Nebraska legislature, a law rejected by a federal
appeals court.

GOP Courting Hispanics With New Ad
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Going after the traditionally Democratic Hispanic vote,
Republicans are airing a Spanish-language TV ad in California that asks voters
to at least consider the GOP. ''This year I plan to keep an open mind and vote
for the best person, and that includes Republicans,'' Christina Bustos, a Latina
from Los Angeles says in the ad, which is also airing in English. The Republican
National Committee is spending $125,000 to test the ad in the Fresno, Calif.,
area and plans to take it national if it proves effective.

Jewish Settlers Occupy Hilltop
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Jewish settlement leaders occupied a hilltop in the
southern West Bank Wednesday, effectively ending an agreement with Israel's
government to coordinate all settlement activity. Leaders of the settlers'
council set up two tents and a generator on Havat Maon, a hill south of Hebron
that had been evacuated with their consent last year after the government ruled
it was on an army firing range. They said the government had violated the terms
of an accord by not granting the same access as Palestinian families who have
recently been allowed to return to the area under a court order.

<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton called Japan's new
prime minister Wednesday night with congratulations and assurances
that the United States would work closely with him.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiro Mori, a former trade minister, was sworn in earlier in
the day to succeed Keizo Obuchi, who suffered a stroke Sunday and
went into a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton placed the call soon after flying from Washington to his
Westchester County home for a night's stay. The president expressed
sorrow over Obuchi's stroke but congratulated Mori on his election,
White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He assured Prime Minister Mori of our desire to work closely
with him on the wide-ranging issues we have in common,'' Kennedy
said.

<HEADLINE> Four Kids Dead in N.C. Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENLY, N.C. (AP) -- A sport-utility vehicle pulled into the path
of a utility truck hauling a small bulldozer on Wednesday, killing
four children, including a 3-year-old girl, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The 2:30 p.m. accident in rural Johnston County also injured
four motorists, one of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The SUV's ''driver failed to stop at the stop sign, or, at a
bare minimum, failed to yield the right of way,'' State Highway
Patrol Sgt. Wade Bulloch said. An investigation was continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Christy Sullivan, 28, of Zebulon, lost her
12-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter, the 3-year-old child of a
friend she was babysitting, and an 8-year-old relative.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan was listed in serious condition Wednesday, while a
12-year-old who also rode in the front seat of her SUV was in fair
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The truck carried two adults who worked for a power line
contractor, Bulloch said. They were treated for minor injuries at a
hospital and released.

By The Associated Press	   A high pressure system spread fair and mild
conditions across
the Southeast on Wednesday, while the Northeast saw rain and sunnyow
showers and the Plains experienced damaging winds.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Light sunnyow showers fell from Vermont to Pennsylvania, with
partly to mostly cloudy skies elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure over North Dakota also brought rain to the northerain
Plains. A warm front moving out of the system spread a band of
showers from Minnesota to Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Winds were gusty over most of the northerain Plains, northerain
Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes, with gusts over 70 mph in the
Dakotas. The wind damaged some buildings in North Dakota, and
Bismarck issued an emergency order for people to stay indoors to
avoid flying glass and other debris. Two planes scheduled to land
Wednesday moraining in Bismarck had to be rerouted to Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Minneapolis, winds gusting to 60 mph caused
scattered power outages and ripped open the inflatable roof of the
Academy of Holy Angels StarDome, a sports facility. No one was
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Wind advisories were in effect from the Dakotas to Wisconsin and
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure over the Southeast brought fair and mild
conditions from the southerain Rockies to the mid-Atlantic states and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A few clouds were seen over the Northwest in association with a
lingering trough of low pressure. There were some light rain
showers over westerain Washington state, but most areas were dry.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest was mostly fair and mild.

<HEADLINE> Fire Breaks Out at National Archives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUITLAND, Md. (AP) -- The second fire in less than two months
broke out Wednesday night at the National Archives' record center.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters knocked down the fire with no injuries Wednesday.
It followed a blaze at the facility on Feb. 29 that was determined
to be the result of arson.
</P>
<P>
   Prince George's County Fire Department spokesman Mark Brady said
the fire was reported at about 5 p.m. The FBI and the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were assisting in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 4 million cubic feet of records are stored at the center
outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Archives officials initially believed that as many as 700,000
pages were damaged or destroyed in the earlier fire, but that
estimate was changed to less than 40,000.
</P>

   Damage from Wednesday's fire was still being assessed.

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks 5, Mighty Ducks 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Jean-Yves Leroux scored from just inside the blue
line with 9:42 remaining to snap a 2-2 tie as the Chicago
Blackhawks defeated Anaheim 5-2 Wednesday night, pushing the Mighty
Ducks closer to playoff elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Leroux fooled goaltender Guy Hebert just 38 seconds after
Anaheim's Paul Kariya tied the game at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Probert added a goal on a breakaway with 3:23 left. Tony
Amonte scored into an empty net with 1:06 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   With two games remaining, Anaheim trails eighth-place San Jose
by three points and seventh-place Edmonton by four in the Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks, skating at home Wednesday against Dallas, needed two
points to assure finishing ahead of the Ducks. The Oilers failed to
get the point they needed to assure finishing ahead of Anaheim by
losing 3-2 to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sullivan and Kevin Dean also scored for the Blackhawks,
who got 27 saves from Jocelyn Thibault.
</P>
<P>
   Ruslan Salei also connected for Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan opened the scoring in the first period when he
one-timed his 20th goal past Hebert from the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   Dean made it 2-0 in the second on a soft, screened shot from the
blue line that floated past Hebert's stick side.
</P>
<P>
   However, Salei replied 54 seconds later. Set up by Teemu
Selanne, Salei ripped a high shot past Thibault from the left
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya tied it at 9:40 of the third when he raced past Dean, cut
in alone on Thibault and lifted in a backhander.
</P>
<P>
   Leroux, who has just three goals, netted the game-winner on
wrist shot that sailed over Hebert's glove.
</P>
<P>
   Probert, who has only four goals, connected on his breakaway
with 3:23 left. Amonte's 42nd goal completed the scoring.

<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Milan Hejduk, Dave Andreychuk and Alex
Tanguay scored goals Wednesday night and the Colorado Avalanche
extended their winning streak to six games with a 3-2 victory over
the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche, which leads the Northwest Division with 94 points
and ranks third in the Northwest Division, also got two assists
from Joe Sakic.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton finished 18-14-9 at home. The Oilers, seventh in the
conference with 84 points, close out the regular season at
Vancouver on Friday and at Calgary on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado took a 2-1 lead at 1:38 of the second period when
Hejduk tucked home Adam Foote's pass while on a power play. The
goal was Hejduk's 34th of the year, and his 13th on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk scored his 20th goal of the season seven minutes
later to put the Avalanche up 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton forward Rem Murray got the Oilers on the scoreboard
when he beat Avalanche goalie Marc Denis at 8:26 of the first
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers added their second goal at 7:31 of the third when
Roman Hamrlik banked a shot in off Denis's stick, which had fallen
to the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Tanguay scored at 5:35 of the first period when he beat Tommy
Salo.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton called up goaltender Mike Minard from the AHL's
Hamilton Bulldogs on Wednesday after backup Bill Ranford suffered a
hamstring strain in the morning skate. Minard was 16-12-5 with a
3.08 goals-against average and a save percentage of .904.

<HEADLINE> Auctioneers Doing Well in Thailand  </HEADLINE>
By NINA SUEBSUKCHAROEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Auctions have become a way of life in
Thailand, perhaps proving that recession as much as necessity can
be the mother of invention.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and condominiums, rare paintings and racy cars are
among the items going before the hammer as Thais try to climb out
of economic crisis. Experts say the auctions have helped smooth out
recovery and provided those who have cash with some real bargains.
</P>
<P>
   ''Auctions are a new choice for consumers,'' said Kritika
Kongsompong, one of the owners of the Union Auction Co. ''The
buyers dictate the market price.''
</P>
<P>
   In the larger scheme, James Pitchon, executive director of the
real estate firm CB Richard Ellis (Thailand) Co., said property
auctions, some of it collateral for bad loans made by banks, is
reducing the banks' heavy debt loads -- a main drag on Thailand's
economic rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden interest in auctions began when the Financial Sector
Restructuring Authority, a specially formed government agency,
started liquidating the assets of 56 finance firms shut down for
insolvency after the onset of the Asian currency crisis in
mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last year, the authority had sold $4.91 billion
worth of seized assets originally valued at $17.63 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Last month it auctioned 66 rare paintings and 2,151 rare bank
notes with the help of the Thai subsidiary of Christie's, the New
York auction house. About $231,000 was earned from the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the authority is seeking to auction off the
non-listed securities of the suspended finance firms.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of auctions, at the nadir of Thailand's
financial crisis in 1998, disposed of more mundane items such as
cars and office furniture from the defunct finance firms.
</P>
<P>
   The authority went to the private sector to handle those sales,
hiring Union Auction to conduct the auctions, which ended up
pumping up the company's business and jump-starting the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Laksak Arunwatana, a bank employee, came away from such auctions
with a near-new Toyota sedan at 10 percent to 15 percent under the
retail price and a townhouse at 20 percent below market value.
</P>
<P>
   ''Auctions are beneficial to buyers in these bad economic
times,'' Laksak said.
</P>
<P>
   Union Auction has also benefitted. The company had 1999 revenue
of $115.8 million, a 42 percent increase over the previous year.
Revenue from automobile auctions grew by 31 percent, to $100
million, while property auctions exploded 356 percent to $14.6
million from $3.2 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenal growth has prompted two other auction houses to
target real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Realty Co. teamed up with American auctioneers Mel
Giller and Associates. Apichart Archadej, the company's managing
director, said he will focus on financial institutions, which have
a very big inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Asset Auction Center, which held its first property auction
early this year, will be holding auctions every other month
throughout the year, said Khaimook Churawat, the company's head of
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping malls are also jumping into the game, holding auctions
to promote business. IT Mall, a relatively new computer superstore,
has held several auctions of computer paraphernalia and electrical
goods.

<HEADLINE> IPO Market Expected To Suffer  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The days when just about any company with a
dot-com in its name could strike it rich on Wall Street by going
public may be over as investors have begun turning a more critical
eye toward these startups.
</P>
<P>
   Four Internet startups have canceled or postponed their initial
public offerings of stock this week because of the market's
unprecedented volatility and sudden disdain for technology
companies with uncertain futures.
</P>
<P>
   Many more of the 260 companies waiting to complete IPOs are
expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   As tech stocks fall out of favor, analysts say only the most
solid companies will be able to go public. And the money raised by
these lucky few companies will probably be far less than they
originally anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many analysts welcome the cooling-off period.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a healthy thing. We've been in a very, very strong IPO
market that's been willing to accept all kinds of companies and put
high valuations on those companies -- even the risky ones,'' said
Kathleen Smith, manager of the Renaissance IPO Plus Aftermarket
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the downturn in stocks will reinstill a ''sense of
discipline'' to the IPO market, something that was lost as
investors chased anything connected to the Internet, pushing the
stocks of unproven companies with dim prospects for a profit into
the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet frenzy helped make IPO history last year, when 543
companies raised a record $69 billion. Up until recently, the trend
appeared to be continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the 146 companies that have gone public this year rose
an average of 98 percent on their first day of trading, according
to Thompson Securities Data Co., a market data business in Newark,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, the market has been harsh to these newcomers.
Nearly 87 percent have fallen below their first-day closing price,
and 29 percent have fallen below their original offering price.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of staying power has been particularly painful for
individual investors, who usually cannot get access to IPOs until
they begin trading on public markets. Since they can buy only after
the price has soared, these investors have frequently been
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   But big institutions and insiders who got the shares at cheap
pre-market prices are also losing money.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the stock of e-commerce company OnVia.com nearly
tripled from the IPO price of $21 to $61.50 on its first day of
trading March 1. By Wednesday, the stock had plummeted to around
$13.
</P>
<P>
   A few other recent deals have tanked from the get-go.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Trader.com, a publisher of classified advertising on
the Internet, debuted on Friday and fell immediately. The stock
opened for trading on the Nasdaq at around $22, well below the
$28.56 IPO price. In subsequent days it plunged with the rest of
the technology sector and was trading Wednesday at around $16.
</P>
<P>
   The four companies that postponed deals Wednesday are Camtek
Ltd., a maker of circuit testers, and three drug makers -- Drugabuse
Sciences Inc., Adolor Corp. and Tanox Inc., a biotech company.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers for each said that they hope to complete the IPOs by the
end of the week, but that the status of each is ''day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   Six companies did manage to go public Wednesday. Two epitomize
the type that investors are likely to keep in favor because they
have established products and a history of profits -- MetLife Inc.,
the nation's No. 2 insurance company, and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   MetLife shares, originally priced at $14.25, opened at $14.50
and closed at $15.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Krispy Kreme,
which was priced at $21, opened on the Nasdaq Stock Market at $32
and by late afternoon stood at $37.
</P>
<P>
   In the tech world, companies involved in improving the
infrastructure of the Internet continue to get a close look from
investors, as do companies involved in wireless transmission of
data. But once-hot Internet retailers are being shunned.
</P>
<P>
   ''The window will shut for all but the very best stock issuers.
That's part of the healing process,'' said Scott Sipprelle, founder
of Midtown Research, a New York company that studies IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the IPO market has been cyclical, shutting down
every 12 to 18 months after a glut of companies files to go public
and investor demand wanes, Sipprelle noted.

<HEADLINE> State Dept: Lockheed Gave China Info  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department has charged defense
contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. with giving a state-owned Chinese
conglomerate a scientific assessment of a Chinese-made satellite
motor in violation of the Arms Export Control Act.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated Tuesday, the State Department's Office of
Defense Trade Controls told the company it has 30 days to respond
to civil charges that could result in a fine as high as $15 million
and ban the company from exporting satellite technology for up to
three years, The Washington Post reported in its editions Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The department's letter charges Lockheed with 30 separate
violations of federal export controls.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin spokesman James L. Fetig denied the
Bethesda-based company had violated export laws, saying it had
obtained a Commerce Department license before assessing the
satellite motor, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
   ''National security was not harmed, and it is our understanding
that there is no criminal violation involved and no criminal
charges pending,'' Fetig said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges involve a team of scientists Lockheed sent to China
in 1994 to assess a rocket motor that Asia Satellite
Telecommunications Co. planned to use in launching a communications
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   After completing its study, Lockheed forwarded 10 copies of a
50-page assessment to Asiasat. In one charge, the State Department
said the company sent an unedited version to Asiasat before Defense
Department export control officials reviewed the document to remove
sensitive information.

Williams each scored 18 for the Rockets, who broke a nine-game
losing streak and beat a winning team away from home for just the
second time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's last road win over a team currently above .500 was
back on Nov. 12, a 97-81 defeat of the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith scored 24 points and Rasheed Wallace had 21 to lead
the Trail Blazers, who had won three straight.
</P>
<P>
   Houston trailed by three at halftime but surged to a 13-point
lead by making 10 of its first 11 shots in the third quarter while
the Blazers started 1-for-10. The Rockets shot 67 percent in the
period, with Anderson making all six of his shots and scoring 15
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers managed to cut the lead to 85-80 by the fourth, but
Houston stayed hot. An awkward, leaning jumper off the glass by
Matt Bullard pushed the lead to 95-88, and a 3-pointer by Francis
made it 98-89 with 6:44 left.
</P>
<P>
   A layup and foul shot by Anderson made it 106-93 with 4:30 to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Houston shot an amazing 73 percent in the second half, going
25-of-34, including 11-for-13 (85 percent) in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers led by as many as six points in the second quarter
but fell flat in the third, missing nine straight shots after
Wallace hit a short jumper to put the Blazers ahead 55-52.
</P>
<P>
   Williams started the Rockets' 15-0 run with consecutive
3-pointers, and Kenny Thomas added a 3 and a fastbreak layup to
help widen the lead to 67-55.
</P>
<P>
   The shots finally started falling for Portland, but the Rockets
kept up the pace. A 3-pointer by Anderson pushed the lead to 76-63,
and his tip-in kept it at 13 with 2:45 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Smith hit two 3s during a quick 9-0 run to cut it to 80-76, and
the Blazers trailed 85-80 heading into the fourth after Wallace's
hook shot with 3.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Houston joined Toronto as the only teams to win at both
Portland and the Los Angeles Lakers this season. ... The Rockets
improved to 9-29 on the road and are trying to avoid their first
single-digit road record since they went 8-32 in 1983-84. ...
Portland's Brian Grant, recovering from fasciaitis on his right
foot, had another strong game with 10 points and 12 rebounds. He
had three offensive boards and a putback on one first-quarter
sequence. ... The Blazers ended their six-game homestand, and with
five road games left need just two more wins to break the
franchise-best road mark of 27-14, set in 1990-91.

<HEADLINE> Pollster says religious vote is misunderstood  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The ''Catholic vote'' doesn't exist and
jewish voters are misunderstood, pollster John Zogby told a group
of reporters on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby, who spoke at the New York State Associated Press
Association's spring seminar about voter moods, said that the
values of voters are too conflicting to be categorized according to
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The same voter who answers a poll saying that they are for a
woman's right to choose, will say that killing a fetus is murder,''
Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no Catholic vote in the U.S. or in New York...and the
Jewish vote is misunderstood to be a one issue, pro-Israel at all
costs group,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby found that two-fifths of Jewish voters live in the suburbs
and vote for moderate Republicans. Using the U.S. Senate race
between Hillary Rodham Clinton and presumptive opponent New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as an example, Zogby described them as
part of ''that white ethnic commuter group who likes what Rudy's
done with the city,'' as opposed to ''knee jerk liberal'' urban
voters.
</P>
<P>
   And while recent polls show Clinton winning New York City,
Giuliani still enjoys a margin over the first lady in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics, who make up 45 percent of New York state's
electorate, are similarly diverse, Zogby said. Catholic voters who
attend mass regularly tend to be conservative, while those who
don't go to mass are quite liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ''And there are more of them on the left than right,'' Zogby
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of a consistent Jewish or Catholic voting
ideology, both Clinton and Giuliani have made concerted efforts to
court voters of each group.
</P>
<P>
   Both have met with rabbis and Orthodox leaders in hopes of
winning over New York's 12 percent Jewish vote. In February, the
mayor of Jerusalem went to New York City to express support for
Giuliani, and in November, the prime minister of Israel defended
Clinton's actions in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been criticized for sitting silently beside Soha
Arafat, wife of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, while she accused
Israelis of using poisonous gas against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Giuliani is expected to win the votes of most Catholics
in the state, but Clinton has won the backing of some vocal
Irish-American groups, which indicates some Catholic support.
</P>
<P>
   A Quinnipiac College Poll released Wednesday showed that among
Jewish voters, Giuliani has lost the 10 point lead he enjoyed over
Clinton on March 2. The first lady now leads by 4 points.
</P>
<P>
   And a Marist College poll from March 29 shows Giuliani leading
Clinton 55-32 among the state's white Catholic voters.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Zogby, none of that is set in stone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things change,'' he said, explaining that polls have shown the
same religious group supporting liberal former Gov. Mario Cuomo one
year and conservative former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato the next.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like you walk into a bar and find five guys who haven't
gone to mass in 40 years. But insult the pope, and they're there
with fists up.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton's claims of 'extra burdens' for political women rebutted  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Comments Hillary Rodham Clinton made
recently about the 'extra burdens' women face in running for office
reek of the ''tired rhetoric of the 70s'' according to a female
Republican in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's an opportunity and a privilege, not a burden, to
run for office,'' said Erie County Sen. Mary Lou Rath on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rath and 10 others, one short of all the female Republicans in
the Legislature, said they are happy with women's place in New York
politics, even though no female has ever been elected governor,
comptroller or attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Three women have been elected lieutenant governor in New York,
all running jointly on tickets headed by male gubernatorial
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the system works,'' Rath said, adding that the U.S.
Senate candidate's comments seem like ''the tired rhetoric of the
70s and I think most of us have rejected that.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has commented on the sexism of politics several
times during her campaign against New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, most recently at a campaign stop just south of Albany
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There, the Democrat said ''there are extra burdens that women
(candidates) face around the country.'' She added female candidates
need ''skin as tough as a rhinoceros.''
</P>
<P>
   She also told an Albany radio station in late January that
people could dislike her because of her political stances or
because she is a woman taking those stances.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson declined to comment
Wednesday, but U.S. Rep Nita Lowey, a Democrat from Westchester
County, backed the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made a lot of progress on women's rights in this
country, but women still face tremendous hurdles in politics,
business and virtually every other professional field,'' she said.
''Everyone knows that. Why else would we have only 67 women in the
House and Senate?''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP lawmakers, while often referring to their children and
home lives, said they support Giuliani's stance on the fatal
shooting of Patrick Dorismond by New York City police last month.
In defending the shooting of the unarmed black man, Giuliani made
public Dorismond's criminal record -- including court-sealed
juvenile records -- and did not visit the man's family.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show Giuliani may have suffered because of that
stance, but when asked what she would do if it had been her child
shot, Assemblywoman Donna Ferrara, from Nassau County, said, ''I
would not have expected a public official to speak to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rath acknowledged women face different challenges than men when
running for office, especially how to balance family and work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some challenges of running seem daunting, but they're not
burdens,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The group also suggested Clinton might be unfamiliar with the
way New York politics work -- since she hadn't lived or worked in
New York until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Her comments show ''she's unfamiliar with elected women across
the state,'' Ferrara said. ''We have greater opportunities because
we're women.''

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 11, Phillies 3  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Lenny Harris hit a grand slam during a six-run
first inning and Mike Morgan got his first save in nine years as
the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Philadelphia Phillies 11-3
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Lee had a solo shot for the Diamondbacks, who got all
their runs on homers in Tuesday night's season-opening 6-4 win over
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Stottlemyre (1-0), who worked out daily during the
offseason to strengthen an unrepaired tear in his right rotator
cuff, gave up three runs and six hits -- including Scott Rolen's
second solo homer in two games -- in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan became the 25th major leaguer to play in four decades
when he relieved starting the sixth. He allowed three hits in four
scoreless innings for his fourth career save, his first since July
7, 1991, with Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is Morgan's 12th team, a record for a franchise in any
U.S. major league.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia starter Paul Byrd (0-1) got just two outs, giving
up six runs, three hits and four walks.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack tripled on Byrd's third pitch and scored on Jay
Bell's sacrifice fly. Byrd walked Luis Gonzalez and Erubiel Durazo,
and Steve Finley had RBI single. Travis Lee walked to load the
bases and Harris followed with his third career slam.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Byrd walked Stottlemyre and was taken out of the
game. Former-Diamondback Amaury Telemaco relieved and ending the
inning by striking out Womack.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia made it 6-3 in the second on Rolen's homer, Mickey
Morandini's RBI single and Desi Relaford's run-scoring, double-play
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Stinnett hit a two-run double off Telemaco in the third,
and Lee homered off Wayne Gomes in the seventh. Lee added a
sacrifice fly in the eighth and Finley had an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Harris' slam was Arizona's 14th in two-plus seasons.
history. ... Finley, who was 4-for-4 in the opener, had a
broken-bat single in the first for his fifth consecutive hit before
his first out of the season -- a fly ball to center in the second.
... ... Morandini, who spent the last two years with the Chicago
Cubs, saw action for the first time on his second tour with the
Phillies. Morandini played in 874 games with the Phillies before
they traded him to Chicago for Doug Glanville on Dec. 23, 1997. ...
Morgan singled in his only at-bat, his 48th hit in 480 career
at-bats (.100). His previous hit was July 10, 1999, with Texas at
San Diego.

<HEADLINE> Oneidas disappointed at breakdown of land claim talks  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERONA, N.Y. (AP) -- Barring a return to the bargaining table,
the Oneida Indian land claim likely is headed to federal court.
That makes Ray Halbritter a disappointed man.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nation's Men's Council and Clan Mothers do not want to be
forced to court to settle this,'' Halbritter, the representative of
the Oneida Indian Nation, said Wednesday at the tribe's Turning
Stone Casino. ''We have worked hard for more than a year to avoid
litigation and to reach a settlement that would fairly address
everyone's concerns. We have always believed that the best way to
resolve the land claim is through negotiation. We are deeply
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations, on fragile ground just a month ago, had been
progressing again until late Tuesday afternoon. Settlement master
Ron Riccio abruptly called an impasse because he said not every
party was committed to the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's over. I don't see any hopes of getting it revived,''
Riccio said before drafting a letter to explain what had happened
in detail to U.S. District Court Judge Neal McCurn. ''I invested
more time in this than in any other mediation I've ever had, and
I've done many of these over the years. In a mediation, where you
can't order anything to happen and you have to rely upon the
cooperation of the parties, it is very easy for someone to cause
the process to fail no matter what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   The land claim stems from the state's purchase of 250,000 acres
in Madison and Oneida counties from the Oneidas of New York,
Wisconsin and Canada in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas filed a lawsuit in 1974 over the transactions. The
U.S. Supreme Court found in 1985 that those transactions were
illegal and ruled that the Oneidas were entitled to compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the federal government sided with the Oneidas and filed
an amended complaint asking that 20,000 landowners in the two
counties be added as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Halbritter detailed the tribe's position in the negotiations. He
said the Oneida Nation offered to pay the counties a fee of $1
million per year for 20 years, agreed to charge its own sales tax
to ensure tax and price parity with other local businesses on such
items as cigarettes and gasoline, and agreed to use state and
federal settlement funds to establish a $25 million land trust fund
to replace property taxes lost through the reacquisition of its
ancestral homelands.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major stumbling blocks was land. The tribe said it
would agree to acquire no more than 5,000 acres in the first 10
years after the settlement, no more than 30,000 acres in a 50-year
period, and no more than 40,000 acres overall.
</P>
<P>
   But Madison County Board of Supervisors Chairman Rocco
DiVeronica said the counties balked at allowing the purchase of
more than 25,000 acres. He said that was the limit constituents had
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   State officials also expressed dismay over the cessation of
talks. Gov. George Pataki was drafting a letter to President
Clinton in an effort to get the federal government out of the case,
Pataki spokesman Mike McKeon said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've very disappointed that the Oneidas walked away over the
land-cap issue despite the counties' willingness to be flexible,''
McKeon said. ''Hopefully, we can get back to the table. We're ready
to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Halbritter said the amount of land the Oneidas are seeking to
reacquire was insignificant considering what the tribe once had.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Oneidas originally owned 6 million acres, and now it's
down to 250,000 acres,'' he said. ''And we're willing to accept 15
percent of what our total claim is.''
</P>
<P>
   Halbritter said the state also created a major stumbling block
by continuing to demand a substantial share of Turning Stone's
profits as a condition for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We simply cannot and will not agree to pay for the state's
wrongdoing,'' he said. ''We've done that for the past 200 years.
We're not going to pay for our own land claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Although negotiations still could resume, the case seems
destined to end up in front of McCurn, who is all-too-familiar with
the process. A jury settled a similar dispute in his Syracuse
courtroom in February involving the Cayuga Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Cayugas successfully argued that 64,015 acres of their
tribal lands were illegally purchased in the late 1790s and early
1800s by New York state and were awarded $36.9 million. However,
they are planning an appeal, which will drag the process on.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a scenario the Oneidas want to duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The really bad news with the collapse of these talks is that
we're headed back to court,'' Halbritter said. ''Going back to
court is in no one's interest.''

<HEADLINE> Third poll shows mayor's support down; campaigns spar on debates  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- If bad news comes in threes, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani now has the polls to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute reported
that the New York City mayor's lead over Hillary Rodham Clinton in
New York's Senate race has evaporated in the wake of the shooting
of an unarmed black man by New York City police. It was the third
such poll in 10 days to show that.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinnipiac poll had the first lady favored by 46 percent of
registered voters while 43 percent backed the mayor. Giuliani led
Clinton, 48 percent to 41 percent, in a March 2 poll from the
Hamden, Conn.-based institute.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier polls, from Zogby International for the New York Post
and from Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion, showed
similar results.
</P>
<P>
   The polls come at a time when some Republicans are questioning
whether the mayor is the best candidate to take on the first lady.
On Sunday, U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio said the GOP was in danger of
''blowing'' the Senate race by backing Giuliani. The Long Island
congressman offered himself as an alternative, if GOP leaders
wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gov. George Pataki said Lazio should shelve any
such thoughts and get behind Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's particularly helpful for other Republicans
to do anything other than get behind the candidacy of Mayor
Giuliani,'' the Republican governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Giuliani's campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum,
sent his counterpart in the Clinton campaign, Bill de Blasio, a
letter asking for a meeting to discuss possible debates. Teitelbaum
said the mayor had expressed interest in debates ''several week
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter back, de Blasio said that ''in Buffalo on February
22, Hillary challenged Mr. Giuliani to a series of debates in every
part of the state. I'm sorry it has taken you so long to respond,
but I guess Mr. Giuliani's falling poll numbers necessitated a
change in your strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said de Blasio planned to call Teitelbaum to set up a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum called de Blasio's written response a ''stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, Mrs. Clinton would rather bob and weave than engage
in a direct discussion of the issues,'' the Giuliani aide said.
</P>
<P>
   With the mayor in Tennessee raising money for his campaign,
Clinton staged a full day of campaigning in New York City and on
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he's been having a bad couple of weeks,'' the first
lady said when asked about her opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the poll, Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Juleanna
Glover Weiss said that ''in light of the recent media coverage,
this is not unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute, said the new poll showed ''a dramatic drop'' for the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the first time in months that Mrs. Clinton has been on
the plus side in this very close race and there's a one-word
explanation -- Dorismond,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Dorismond was fatally shot by New York City police last
month. In defending the police in the shooting of the unarmed black
man, Giuliani made public Dorismond's criminal record, including
court-sealed juvenile records. That has drawn heavy criticism of
the mayor, including some from fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Attention on the issue in New York City doesn't figure to
diminish soon. About 700 protesters rallied near City Hall on
Wednesday, and one group was removed by police after briefly
blocking traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge. Many protesters chanted
''Giuliani must go!''
</P>
<P>
   And the Rev. Al Sharpton, who led regular protests last year
after the Amadou Diallo shooting, announced plans Wednesday for
daily acts of civil disobedience around the city during Easter week
to draw attention to police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, 50 percent of voters said they disapproved of
Giuliani's response to the Dorismond shooting, with the greatest
disapproval coming from New York City (72 percent) and in the
suburban counties surrounding the city (54 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac's telephone poll of 1,058 registered voters was
conducted March 28-April 3 and has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes 3, Predators 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- No Keith Tkachuk, no problem for the Phoenix
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Mikael Renberg scored his 150th career goal as the Coyotes,
missing an injured Tkachuk, beat the Nashville Predators 3-2
Wednesday night for their fourth win in five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes pulled even with the Los Angeles Kings for fifth
place in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Mika Alatalo and Shane Doan also scored for Phoenix, which plays
host to San Jose on Friday before ending the regular season Sunday
at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Sean Burke preserved the win with 13:54 remaining
when he stopped Scott Walker on a breakaway after the defenseman
had stolen a lazy pass at the top of the Predators' zone.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Johnson and David Gosselin scored for the Predators, who
have lost six of their last eight.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have made their late-season run without Tkachuk, who
practiced on Wednesday but was scratched for the fourth straight
game with a sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk originally sprained the ankle Jan. 31 in a 5-3 victory
over Detroit, sat out one game, then aggravated the injury Feb. 12
against Calgary and has appeared in just three games since.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk also was given a two-game suspension for high-sticking
Colorado Avalanche defenseman Aaron Miller on March 23.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, who recorded consecutive 50-goal seasons in 1996-97 and
1997-98, also has missed time because of a sore neck and neck and
back spasms. The 28-year-old left winger has missed 29 games this
year and 49 games over the past three seasons to injury.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is 13-15-2 without Tkachuk in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville took a 1-0 lead at 8:23 of the first period when
Vitali Yachmenev passed the puck to Johnson, who was standing alone
in the low slot. After a couple of fakes, Johnson pulled the puck
to his forehand and flipped it over Burke's right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Renberg tied the game five minutes later on a hard shot from
between the circles. Nashville goalie Mike Dunham got a piece of
the shot with his right skate, but the puck trickled behind him to
give Renberg his first goal since March 11.
</P>
<P>
   Alatalo used a fortuitous bounce to put the Coyotes ahead 2-1 at
3:15 of the second period. Louie DeBrusk bounced a 60-foot wrist
shot off the far post, the puck rolled softly onto Alatalo's stick,
and he scored into an open net.
</P>
<P>
   Doan extended Phoenix's lead to 3-1 when he fought off a check
by Karlis Skrastins and scored midway through the second period.

<HEADLINE> Fraud probe could spread to Bennett's wife  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Gwen Bennett has had a close look as
federal authorities have prosecuted her husband for cheating
investors out of $700 million. She may soon have an insider's view.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mrs. Bennett's legal advisers fears remarks made by a
federal judge indicate that she, too, may be prosecuted in
connection with what authorities have called the largest pyramid
scheme ever uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Bennett appeared in a Manhattan federal courtroom last
week ready to be sentenced for fraud. Instead, U.S. District Judge
John S. Martin adjourned sentencing until April 28, giving Bennett
a chance to win back 10 years of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's offer was to reduce Bennett's sentence from 30 years
to 20 years if the Bennetts agreed to surrender a 100-acre horse
farm, a hotel and stock in a racetrack that are in Mrs. Bennett's
name.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Martin said he had concluded that Mrs. Bennett
lied on the witness stand in January when she claimed that she and
her husband did not conspire to put his assets in her name to keep
them away from investors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would take that as a threat,'' said Michael J. Misiaszek.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's office would not say whether Mrs. Bennett is
the subject of a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Bennett used his companies to entice investors
from 46 states into financing bogus leases for office equipment.
Bennett Funding filed for bankruptcy in March 1996, a day after
federal authorities brought fraud charges against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the victims were elderly people who entrusted their life
savings to the company.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has vowed to get back as much money as he can for the
victims. He has given Bennett and his family four chances to return
property to the bankruptcy trustee, who is selling Bennett
companies' assets and repaying creditors owed more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement filed with the court before Martin's remarks,
Mrs. Bennett called the judge's offer ''highly improper'' and
labeled it ''coercion.''
</P>
<P>
   Misiaszek said that he warned Mrs. Bennett to factor in the
possibility of criminal charges against her in weighing her
decision. Mrs. Bennett has not yet made a decision about the
assets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bennett said in documents that she twice tried to turn over
some of her assets to the bankruptcy trustee.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy trustee rejected those offers because they didn't
include all the assets sought by the judge, said the trustee's
lawyer, William Russell. The deal also came with ''significant
strings attached,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Bennett wanted a complete release from every claim we
have against her. We don't want to do that,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bennett has 30 lawsuits brought against her by the
bankruptcy trustee and others, Misiaszek said.
</P>
<P>
   Other court papers filed by Mrs. Bennett include a deed that
identifies her as the sole owner of the horse farm in Oneida, for
sale at $888,000. She also identified herself as the sole owner of
the Comfort Suites Hotel at Vernon Downs racetrack. The hotel is
valued at $3 million but has a debt of $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bennett is afraid that if she turns over the hotel, she
won't have money to support her two young sons, Misiaszek said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's just trying to preserve something for her future and the
future of her children,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pataki: Lazio should stay out of Senate race, back Giuliani  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio should stop talking
about being a Rudolph Giuliani alternative for the GOP's Senate
nomination to face Hillary Rodham Clinton, New York state's most
powerful Republican said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it is particularly helpful for other Republicans
to do anything other than get behind the candidacy of Mayor
Giuliani,'' Gov. George Pataki told a state Capitol news
conference. ''I urge him (Lazio) and all the others to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Lazio said he feared the GOP was in danger of losing
the Senate race with Giuliani and offered himself as an
alternative, if party leaders wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Lazio said it appeared unlikely the New York
City mayor could win the backing of the state's Conservative Party.
No Republican in New York has won statewide office without the
support of the Conservative Party since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said Republicans need a candidate who can unite the party,
attract Democrats and independents and ''present a better, more
positive, more inclusive message for Republicans.'' The congressman
from Long Island said he didn't think Giuliani was the best
candidate to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's just wrong,'' Pataki said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made it plain months ago that I think the mayor has earned
the right to be our candidate,'' the governor added. ''He has gone
out since that time and mounted an effective campaign. I have every
confidence that he will be our next senator come November.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, state GOP Chairman William Powers had delivered much
the same message. The GOP leader said he had detected no support
among local party leaders across the state for a Lazio candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said Wednesday that he didn't want to comment on the
governor's statement until he had a chance to talk personally with
him. The congressman said he had placed a telephone call to Pataki,
but wasn't certain when they would discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''My preference is to deal with this face-to-face,'' the
congressman said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lazio had said that if Pataki, Powers and other GOP
leaders didn't want him in the Senate race, he wouldn't enter it.
</P>
<P>
   Recent independent polls have shown Giuliani's previous small
lead over Clinton has evaporated in the wake of widespread
criticism of his handling of the fatal shooting last month by New
York City police of an unarmed black man, Patrick Dorismond. In
defending the police, Giuliani released Dorismond's criminal
record, including court-sealed juvenile records.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had been preparing to run for Senate until Pataki threw
his support behind Giuliani in August 1999 and asked Lazio to
suspend his effort. The congressman did so.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said Wednesday that he hoped Giuliani and the leaders of
the Conservative Party, who are close to the governor, could work
out their differences. Michael Long, the chairman of the
Conservative Party, has said Giuliani's continued support for
abortion rights is a stumbling block. The mayor has refused to
budge on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Land Reformer Acquitted  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL ASTOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VITORIA, Brazil (AP) -- Activists applauded the acquittal of a
prominent land reform leader at his retrial on murder charges,
calling it a victory for the international human rights community.
</P>
<P>
   A seven member jury acquitted Jose Rainha Jr. on Wednesday in
the killings of farm owner Jose Macado Neto and an off-duty
policeman during a failed 1989 attempt by rural workers to occupy a
ranch in southeastern Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Rainha's trial, which began Monday in this eastern port city,
has refocused attention on the country's often bloody land
disputes, which have cost more than 1,000 lives over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Rainha was not accused of carrying out the killings, but the
prosecution said he was the ''intellectual author'' of the deaths.
The nine men accused of shooting at the victims remain at large.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was clearly a political trial,'' said Maria Luisa
Mendonca of the human rights group Global Justice. ''The defense
was very strong, and the evidence against him very weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, who described Rainha as a rabble-rouser who incited
the rural workers to violence, relied largely on sworn statements
from neighbors and testimony from people who said they had heard
Rainha was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses for the defense confirmed Rainha's alibi that, on the
day of the shootings, the squatters' leader was in the northeastern
state of Ceara, 1,400 miles away from where the killings took
place.
</P>
<P>
   Mendonca described the verdict as a victory for the
international human rights community. Without attention from
abroad, she said she believes Rainha would have been convicted as
he was once before in 1997, when he was sentenced to 26{ years in
prison. Brazilian law guarantees a retrial for anyone sentenced to
20 years or more for a single crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last trial was clearly unfair,'' said Julia Rochester of
Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   Rainha's group organizes invasions of idle land to pressure the
government to speed up agrarian reform in a country where the
richest 20 percent of the people hold 90 percent of the land, while
the poorest 40 percent own just 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and human rights groups said the charges were trumped
up to weaken the movement just as it was gaining support from
middle class Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has definitely been an effort to criminalize the actions
of'' Rainha's group, Mendonca said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters erupted in cheers as the verdict was read and carried
Rainha on their shoulders to a nearby square, where thousands of
movement members had camped out to watch the proceedings on a giant
screen television.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth is like divine justice,'' Rainha said following the
verdict. ''It may take a while to arrive, but it always emerges.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they would file an appeal on the grounds that
defense witnesses had communicated with each other during the
trial.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Most Americans Live With Pain  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Aches. Soreness. Irritation -- Americans know the
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   A newly released survey shows that 89 percent of U.S. adults
experience pain at least once a month and more than half believe
it's just something people have to live with.
</P>
<P>
   The results have alarmed pain management specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just getting older in the U.S. does not mean you've got to be
in misery and got to be sick all the time,'' Dr. B. Eliot Cole of
Las Vegas, a consultant on pain management, said Wednesday. ''Don't
sell yourself short just because you have a few miles on your
chassis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gallup survey of 2,002 adults over the age of 18, conducted
for the Arthritis Foundation, found that 46 percent of women and 37
percent of men experience pain daily.
</P>
<P>
   The most common type of pain, reported by 23 percent of the
respondents, was joint pain. Backaches, sore feet and muscle pain
are the next most common ailments. Arthritis was fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Only half the adults visited a doctor for pain in the past three
years. Eighty percent believe aches and pains are just a part of
getting older, and 28 percent believe there is no solution, the
survey found.
</P>
<P>
   The Arthritis Foundation, which is based in Atlanta, released
the survey results Wednesday as part of the launch of a public
information program, ''Speaking of Pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Klippel, the foundation's medical director, said the
survey indicates Americans need to be taught that living with pain
is not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''By talking to a health care provider about their pain, people
can start taking control of their lives by controlling their
pain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A large majority of the survey respondents ages 65 and older --
88 percent -- said they believe getting older is the cause of their
pain, and 69 percent cited arthritis as the reason.
</P>
<P>
   Younger respondents, ages 18-34, attributed their pain to
tension or stress, being overworked or their lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four percent of pain sufferers will see a doctor only when
they cannot stand the pain any longer and 60 percent of the
respondents said pain is something people must live with.
</P>
<P>
   Sophye Hochberg, 25, of Bethesda, Md., said that's not true. She
suffers from chronic pain brought on by a congenital condition and
injuries from a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't realize how many options there are and how many
new things come up. If they find the right pain doctor, you don't
even have to take long-term pain medications,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many survey respondents -- 43 percent -- said pain keeps them from
activities as simple as standing or waiting in line for long
periods of time. Twenty-seven percent said they missed worked in
the past year due to pain.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallup results were based on a telephone survey of 1,002
women and 1,000 men ages 18 and older from May 21 to June 9, 1999.
The margin of error was plus or minus 2 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Heart Bypass Lowers Diabetic Risk  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Bypass surgery can dramatically reduce diabetics'
risk of dying
from a subsequent heart attack, according to a study in today's New
England Journal of Medicine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh looked at 641
diabetics and 2,962 non-diabetics who had been treated for reduced
blood flow to the heart with either bypass surgery or balloon
angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 percent in each group had a first heart attack within
the succeeding five years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the diabetics, the differences in survival were dramatic:
Only 17 percent of those who had undergone bypass surgery died
after a heart attack, compared with 80 percent of those who had
received angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   The study, like previous research, found that among
non-diabetics, bypass surgery was no more effective than
angioplasty in preventing deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics with heart disease usually have much more extensive
clogging of the arteries than non-diabetics, so when they suffer
heart attacks their oxygen-starved hearts have a much harder time
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   However, the study suggests the heart recovers from a heart
attack just as quickly in diabetics who have undergone bypass
surgery as in non-diabetics, because bypass surgery is more
effective long-term than angioplasty at maintaining healthy blood
flow to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   In bypass surgery, doctors cut away sections of badly damaged
arteries leading to the heart, then graft pieces of healthy blood
vessel -- often from the patient's leg -- in their place.
</P>
<P>
   In balloon angioplasty, a tiny balloon is inflated inside a
blood vessel to compress fatty buildup on the artery walls. Often,
however, the procedure must be repeated because the arteries clog
up again.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers, led by Dr. Katherine Detre, noted that
newer research shows that stents -- mesh tubes that are inserted
during angioplasty -- keep blood vessels open longer.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Steven Haffner of the
University of Texas in San Antonio said stents could improve
survival among diabetics who suffer heart attacks. Detre's group is
planning a study that will test that theory.
</P>
<P>
   In another study in the journal, Dutch researchers found that
angioplasty did not work much better than drugs at controlling high
blood pressure in patients with narrowing of the arteries that lead
to the kidneys.

<HEADLINE> Study Cites Bias on New Hips  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF BARNARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Canadian women with severe arthritis were three times less
likely than men to get the hip or knee replacements they needed,
researchers reported today in the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   They said doctors' preconceptions may deserve some of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think what is going on here is barriers exist for women
that don't exist for men,'' said Dr. Gillian Hawker, an associate
professor of medicine at the University of Toronto who led the
study.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation ''may be that the family doc maybe sees the
problem as less significant than for men, because men are out there
working, or a retired man is out there golfing, and women are
predominantly housekeeping,'' Hawker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe the woman is less demanding, or less often bringing up
the issue that her joint hurts her. And maybe if it is brought up
or suggested as a topic of conversation, she is putting an end to
it because there is no way she could handle it, because she is
concerned about who would take care of her after she gets home.''
</P>
<P>
   The study of Toronto-area men and women age 55 and older found
that women are three times more likely than men to need joint
replacement but undergo the operation at about the same rate as
men.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a procedure that provides fairly consistent and
long-lasting relief in pain and disability, and apparently we are
not doing enough of them,'' said Dr. James Wright, associate
professor of surgery at the University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The results probably hold true for the United States as well,
the researchers said. Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of
disability in both the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Klippel, medical director for the Arthritis Foundation,
found the results surprising, because osteoarthritis is so common
and women are twice as likely to suffer from it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of this may be just a lack of understanding on the part
of the general public of the commonness of arthritis and what can
actually be done about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Arthritis Foundation, 20.7 million Americans
suffer from osteoarthritis. Out of 124,000 hip replacements in the
United States in 1994, 49,000 were men and 75,000 women, the
American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons said. Of the 209,000 knee
replacements, 78,000 were men and 130,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   In the Canadian study, researchers used tax records to contact
48,218 older people and find those with hip or knee problems. From
there, they identified 990 prime candidates for hip or knee
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, 32.5 percent of the women and 41.8 percent of the men
reported ever discussing joint replacement with a doctor. The
researchers found that 12.7 percent of the women and 8.8 percent of
the men were ''definitely willing'' to go through with it.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, researchers found 5.3 women out of every 1,000 in the
original survey group merited joint replacement, compared with 1.6
men out of 1,000. But the rates of joint replacement were about the
same for both men and women, at 0.7 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Mary Charlson, a professor at
Weill Medical College in New York, and John Allegrante, professor
of clinical public health at Columbia University in New York,
suggested that the discrepancy between men and women may be tied to
their circles of friends.
</P>
<P>
   People tend to go to a doctor asking for a joint replacement
after talking to a friend who had one that worked out, Charlson
said.

<HEADLINE> Bitter Taste Gene Receptors Found  </HEADLINE>
By RICK CALLAHAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have found gene clusters responsible for allowing
humans to taste bitter substances, a finding that could help in
masking the unappealing flavors of medicine and certain healthful
foods.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were reported in today's issue of the journal
Nature, just two weeks after another team of researchers found
basically the same family of genes through a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   The teams worked independently but are both affiliated with the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Their work suggests that humans have evolved a complex system
for detecting the wide array of bitter-tasting compounds. And for
good reason, since failing to detect toxic substances could be
fatal.
</P>
<P>
   How the brain processes the taste perceptions -- including sweet,
sour, bitter and salty -- sent from the tongue's array of sensors is
still cloaked in mystery, said Sue Kinnamon, a neuroscientist at
Colorado State University.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no idea how taste is coded in the central nervous
system, whether there is any kind of a topographic map of tastes in
the brain,'' said Kinnamon, who wasn't involved in the research.
''These findings give us the potential to now label bitter pathways
so we can look at how they target in the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying Nature commentary, Stuart Firestein of
Columbia University said the research could eventually lead to
better-tasting medicines and ways to tweak foods that are good for
you so they also taste good.
</P>
<P>
   ''The taste field has had quite a start to the millennium,''
Firestein wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Both Howard Hughes teams were seeking out genes involving
specific taste receptors by focusing on chromosome regions known to
be involved in taste impairments in mice and humans.
</P>
<P>
   They delved into the vast online database of the Human Genome
Project, a government-funded effort to create a blueprint of human
DNA, and also an online database that allowed them to compare the
human and mouse chromosome structure.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by Linda Buck, an associate professor of neurobiology
at Harvard Medical School, zeroed in on 11 different genes that
encode proteins that then function as taste receptors within taste
buds.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the University of California at San Diego and
the National Institutes of Health announced that they had isolated
the same clusters of taste-encoding genes in the March 17 issue of
the journal Cell.

<HEADLINE> Molecule Hits Drug-Resistant Germs  </HEADLINE>
By RICK CALLAHAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have created a molecule that delivers a knockout
punch to deadly, drug-resistant strains of bacteria, raising the
possibility of a powerful class of antibiotics just when doctors
need them most.
</P>
<P>
   Drug-resistant bacteria are a growing global threat, a
phenomenon blamed on overuse of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   In today's issue of the journal Nature, researchers at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison reported that they have created
a molecule modeled on peptides, the natural proteins that organisms
ranging from plants to humans use to kill bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, attempts to harness peptides have met with problems
because they are rapidly disarmed within living tissues and often
harm human cells along with the germs.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers said their synthetic version, called a
beta-peptide, appears not to harm blood cells or break down within
the body.
</P>
<P>
   In the lab, it proved active against several drug-resistant
bacteria, including strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus
and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
</P>
<P>
   Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is considered the last line of
defense against enterococcus bacteria, which cause deadly
infections in the abdomen, urinary tract, post-surgical wounds and
even heart valves. Methicillin targets staphylococcus, which is
responsible for serious infections of the skin, tissue, bones and
joints.
</P>
<P>
   The beta-peptide seems to work by the same mechanism as the
natural peptide, by punching holes in the bacteria's membrane, said
Samuel Gellman, a chemistry professor at Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ''It points to a whole new class of potential antibiotics that
people haven't thought about before. It's a sort of new dimension
in design,'' Gellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the molecule works differently than traditional
antibiotics, it would probably be harder for bacteria to evolve
resistance to it, said Marissa Miller of the National Institute of
Allergies and Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's interesting is that this is an entirely new approach
and we need every new idea we can get to combat antibiotic
resistance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs already in advanced stages of development could be altered
to incorporate the type of potent beta-peptide created by Gellman's
team, said Robert Hancock, a professor of microbiology at the
University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ''This points to a way of making these molecules less toxic and
longer-lasting in the body,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a government panel urged the Food and Drug
Administration to approve Zyvox, a synthetic compound made by
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn that has shown promise attacking drug-resistant
bacteria. If approved, it would be the first entirely new
antibiotic in 35 years.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 111, Warriors 104  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Despite the happy ending, Kobe Bryant
might have had more fun at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   A day after catching the film ''Romeo Must Die'' while sitting
out a one-game suspension, Bryant was held to 16 points as the Los
Angeles Lakers struggled to a 111-104 win Wednesday night over the
woeful Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal scored 49 points as the Lakers won their 11th
straight game and clinched homecourt advantage throughout the
playoffs. Los Angeles has won 30 of its last 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   Devean George hit all four of his 3-point attempts and scored 14
points for the Lakers. The rookie had hit just 10 3-pointers all
season before Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, suspended for fighting New York's Chris Childs on
Sunday, went 5-for-14 from the field and was held six points below
his average. The Lakers trailed for most of the game, regaining the
lead only in the final second of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Donyell Marshall had 32 points and 18 rebounds for the Warriors,
who lost their season-high eighth straight home game.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State has lost 10 straight overall, and 18 of 19. This is
the second time the Warriors have had a 10-game losing streak this
season -- they lost 12 straight in December and January.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing 51-47 at halftime, the Lakers pulled ahead 77-75
entering the fourth quarter as O'Neal scored 18 points while going
5-for-5 from the field in the third period. Bryant hit a 3-pointer
with one-tenth of a second left in the third to give Los Angeles
its first lead since the opening quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw and George hit consecutive 3-pointers to open the
fourth period and give the Lakers an 83-75 lead,and two straight
baskets by O'Neal made it 87-77. Another 3-pointer by George made
it 95-81 with 6:21 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall hit a 3-pointer with 2:50 left to cap a 15-7 run that
pulled the Warriors within six points, and Sam Jacobson's follow
shot with 2:13 left pulled Golden State to 102-98. But O'Neal added
two more baskets and Bryant hit five foul shots as the Lakers held
on for the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors used a 15-2 run bridging the first and second
periods to take a 30-21 lead, and held a four-point halftime lead.
Marshall had 15 points in the first half, while O'Neal had 18
points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ron Harper missed the game for the Lakers with a sore left
knee, taking a rest after playing 39 minutes Tuesday night at
Phoenix because of Bryant's suspension. ... The Lakers swept the
four-game season series against Golden State, winning the games by
an average margin of 16 points. ... The Lakers lead the NBA with a
31-8 road record.

<HEADLINE> Study: Smokers Face Heart Risk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Smokers who carry a gene already linked
to smoking-related illnesses face about twice the risk of heart
disease than smokers who don't carry it, researchers suggest.
</P>
<P>
   The findings in the April issue of Atherosclerosis involved
1,290 people in Forsyth County, the suburbs of Minneapolis,
Washington County, Md., and Jackson, Miss. Four hundred subjects
had suffered heart attacks or were newly diagnosed with heart
disease, while 890 served as controls.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals without the gene GSTT1 had about a 60 percent
greater risk of heart problems if they smoked while those with the
gene had about a 180 percent greater risk, said study co-author
James Pankow, a professor at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Among people who don't smoke, the gene seems to make no
difference in heart disease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found the gene present in four-fifths of the
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The results were somewhat surprising, said Dr. Richey Sharrett,
senior scientific advisor for the epidemiology and biometry program
at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Sharrett said Wednesday that similar studies focusing on the
gene's role in smoking and cancer showed more varied results, but
said the heart disease research's methodology was valid.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it were replicated, I think that it would provide ...
important clues'' to the link between smoking and heart disease, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The GSTT1 gene is considered an integral link in how the body
processes the chemicals found in tobacco smoke. Pankow said the
gene already has been linked to other smoking-related illnesses,
such as bladder cancer.

<HEADLINE> Test for Steak Prospects Developed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOOSTER, Ohio (AP) -- Two researchers have developed a genetic
test to determine which young steers will produce prime rib and
which will produce only ground chuck.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA test can identify, with 99 percent accuracy, whether
cattle have the genetic potential to produce tender, tasty beef if
fed and raised properly, said Francis Fluharty, an Ohio State
University feedlot nutritionist who developed the test along with
molecular biologist Daral Jackwood.
</P>
<P>
   Fluharty said the test would allow farmers and feedlot operators
to avoid wasting time and money fattening up cattle that will never
produce high-quality steaks. Tough-meat cattle could be eliminated
through selective breeding, meaning consumers would get only
quality choice cuts for their money.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the potential is huge,'' said Jim Riemann, executive
director of the Certified Angus Beef Program, which plans to
license the test for exclusive use in Angus cattle. ''It should
take a lot of variability out of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The test would be done early in a steer's life. Inferior animals
could be raised for hamburger or other ground meat whose tenderness
isn't as important.
</P>
<P>
   Savings could reach $40 to $50 per animal in the feedlot,
Fluharty said. The technology, if widely used, could eliminate most
tough beef from the marketplace within a decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The test would require a few drops of blood, cost about $10 per
animal and take about a week, the researchers said. Further
refinements to the test and finding labs to perform it could take
up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said until now, there was no reliable way of
predicting which individual cattle would produce flavorful meat.
</P>
<P>
   An ultrasound scan can show how much fat has built up on a
steer's back at a particular time, but it can't show how that fat
is distributed or whether it is flecked throughout the animal's
muscle in the desirable pattern called marbling.
</P>
<P>
   Meat graders from the U.S. Department of Agriculture look for
marbling when deciding whether to rate beef as prime, choice or
select.

   RALEIGH (AP) -- A researcher is using DNA analysis of
150-year-old potato leaves to get to the bottom of Ireland's Great
Potato Famine of the 1840s, which sent a huge wave of immigrants
across the Atlantic to America.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Ristaino, a plant pathologist at North Carolina State
University since 1987, has identified DNA from the pathogen,
Phytophthora infestans, in the dried leaves of blight-stricken
potatoes preserved from the famine.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough could lead others to perform genetic analysis
on preserved samples of plant life to track down other crop
killers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are the first group to successfully (replicate) plant
pathogen DNA from old historic samples,'' said Ristaino. ''Now what
I want to do is track where it came from.''
</P>
<P>
   The famine killed more than a million Irish during the mid-19th
century and dispersed a million more to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The potato originated in a part of South America that includes
modern-day Chile and Peru. Spanish explorers brought the potato
back to Europe and to North America, and it became a sustenance
crop for the Irish.

<HEADLINE> Turk President's Re-Election Nixed  </HEADLINE>
By SUZAN FRASER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Parliament has put an end to President
Suleyman Demirel's aspirations for re-election, but Turkey's most
enduring leader is far from through with his political career.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the 76-year-old Demirel, who has served as premier
seven times and has been president since 1993, has hinted that he
could return to active politics when his term ends on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''How will I use my energy?'' Demirel said recently. ''Not by
watering flowers or by taking care of chickens. ... I'll find
something to do, no one should worry.''
</P>
<P>
   The government failed to gather enough votes in Parliament on
Wednesday for a constitutional amendment that would have allowed
Demirel, who has dominated Turkish politics for close to 40 years,
to seek a second term as president.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit had been pushing for another term
for Demirel, whom he sees as a stabilizing force.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition parties and several lawmakers from Ecevit's
coalition government refused to back the bill, some arguing that it
was time for Turkey to choose a younger head of state. Presidents
in Turkey are figureheads with limited powers to appoint
governments or reject legislation, but can play the crucial role of
a power broker at a time of political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The government now faces the painful task of finding Demirel's
successor. None of the parties in the coalition government alone
has the majority to elect its own candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The search for a new candidate comes as the government, backed
by a $4 billion IMF loan, has embarked on an ambitious economic
program to fight chronic inflation. The coalition also must reform
Turkey's laws to prepare for full membership in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulty ahead, Ecevit assured the public
Wednesday that there would be no government crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Demirel is out of the running for president, analysts
predict that he will either form a new party or try to snatch back
the leadership of the center-right True Path Party, which he
founded. The party is currently led by former premier Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tomorrow, he'll start from zero as though nothing has
happened,'' said Husamettin Cindoruk, once a close aide to Demirel.
''And he'll find a lot of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Long referred to as ''Coban Sulu'' or ''Shepherd Sulu,'' --
diminutive for Suleyman -- because of his peasant origins, Demirel
later earned the affectionate name ''Baba'' or father. But more
recently he has been called ''Sultan Suleyman'' -- an allusion to
the Ottoman sultans' long reigns.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Radikal recently devoted its front page to
pictures of Demirel meeting with a series of world leaders who are
long-dead or who have long since retired.
</P>
<P>
   Demirel, a burly, balding figure, entered politics in 1961. He
captured the leadership of his Justice Party in 1965 and first
became premier at age 40 that year. Since then, he has been a
dominant force in Turkish politics and made spectacular comebacks
despite twice being removed from office by the military.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Turkey's military commanders demanded Demirel's
resignation through an ultimatum broadcast on state radio. Demirel
complied within 24 hours. He was forced out of office again in a
1980 military coup that followed bloody fighting in streets and
university campuses that killed thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   Demirel has endured despite allegations of his brothers' and
nephew's shady business dealings.

<HEADLINE> Danish Queen To Celebrate Birthday  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTIAN WIENBERG, Associated Press Writers
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Like many modern women, Denmark's
popular Queen Margrethe divides her busy life between her job, her
family and her artistic works.
</P>
<P>
   And the monarch, who turns 60 on April 16, has no plans to slow
down.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has always been my feeling and the way I was brought up
too, that you're in this for life,'' Margrethe said. ''We don't
have the tradition in this country of giving up, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Margrethe is easily the most popular public figure among Danes,
who hold the monarchy sacred despite their egalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
   At noon on her birthday, thousands are expected at the
Amalienborg Castle square, where the Royal Guards will present arms
in their red gala uniforms. Margrethe will appear on the balcony
while the flag-waving crowd will, according to tradition, shout
''hurrah'' seven times.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon she will ride in a carriage through Copenhagen,
escorted by mounted Hussars, and be celebrated at banquets.
</P>
<P>
   Only her oldest son, 31-year-old Crown Prince Frederik will be
absent -- he is participating in a 2,170-mile dogsled trek with five
other members of an elite navy unit.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing Frederik would not be able to attend, Margrethe visited
him this week. She flew to Greenland's northernmost point, 310
miles south of the North Pole, bringing along an almond cake.
</P>
<P>
   Margrethe said she is proud of her son but needs a bit of help
communicating with Frederik by e-mail because she hasn't yet
mastered computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are things that I'm not very good at keeping pace with.
I'm very aware of that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark's first reigning queen in five centuries, Margrethe rose
to the throne when her father, King Frederik IX, died in 1972.
Three years earlier she had wed French diplomat Henri Count de
Laborde de Monpezat, who became Prince Henrik. They have two sons,
Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim, 30.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she became grandmother when Joachim's wife, Princess
Alexandra, gave birth to a son.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's wonderful to see the family becoming more numerous,'' the
queen said. ''It makes you think how time passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Margrethe has won praise for her artistic works, which range
from abstract paintings and embroidery of church vestments to
making altar pieces and dinnerware.
</P>
<P>
   She also has illustrated a limited edition of J.R.R. Tolkien's
''The Lord of the Rings'' and designed costumes for television and
theater plays. She most recently co-directed a 28-minute television
movie of Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales.
</P>
<P>
   Margrethe said she enjoys spending evenings with her husband,
listening to music, reading books and playing cards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we ever lack something to do together,'' she
laughed to her husband, who had only one request for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''That she goes on being how she is, how she has been. I have no
complaints yet,'' Henrik said.

<HEADLINE> Mori Becomes Japan's Prime Minister  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC TALMADGE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- In selecting Yoshiro Mori as the country's new
prime minister, Japan's ruling party had hoped to end a succession
crisis created by the sudden collapse of Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   But on Mori's first day in office, it appeared the crisis was
anything but over.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders and major newspapers today demanded that Mori
call snap elections to prove his mandate, voters seemed to see him
as a stand-in and rumors were rife that his fellow Liberal
Democrats were already jockeying to be next in line.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, a former trade minister, was installed as prime minister
Wednesday with a solid majority of votes in both houses of
Parliament, replacing Obuchi, who has been in a coma since
suffering a massive stroke over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi remained on life support today at Tokyo's Juntendo
hospital, said chief Cabinet secretary Mikio Aoki. Obuchi's wife,
Chizuko, and three children were with him, but his brother returned
home, reportedly because it appeared Obuchi's condition could stay
the same for some time.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as it became clear that Obuchi's condition was grave,
Liberal Democratic Party officials rallied behind Mori, the party's
second-in-command.
</P>
<P>
   Pledging to stay his predecessor's course, Mori has retained all
of the ministers in Obuchi's Cabinet for his new administration and
vowed to emphasize Obuchi's economic and political reform
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   His top priority, he said, will be to nurse Japan's budding
economic recovery and boost private consumption, long considered
the central weak spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I must continue to keep Prime Minister Obuchi's thoughts in
mind,'' Mori said as he began his first day in office. ''That is
very important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Mori's first official acts was a brief telephone
conversation with President Clinton and a meeting with a visiting
Chinese Communist Party leader.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the premier's official residence, storms were
brewing.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mori has a solid record as a leader within the ruling
party, he has a relatively weak Cabinet portfolio. He's never been
foreign or finance minister, and many analysts see him as highly
vulnerable to rivals within his party.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is not knowledgeable on foreign policy or the economy,''
said Fukuji Taguchi, a political scientist at Tokyo's Ritsumeikan
University. ''He doesn't have much leadership ability, and often
makes controversial comments.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition party leaders, meanwhile, strongly criticized the
manner in which Mori was chosen, pointing out that it was the
convenience of the ruling party and not his accomplishments as a
statesman that won him the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition could not block Mori's election because the
Liberal Democrats' majority in Parliament assures their leader of
being installed as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pressing for elections as soon as possible,'' said
Ichiro Nakayama, an official with the Democratic Party, Japan's
largest opposition group.
</P>
<P>
   He said that would probably be in June, after budget-related
bills have been passed.
</P>
<P>
   Elections for the lower house of Parliament must be held by
October. Though Mori has said he wants to deal with policy issues
first, most analysts now believe he will likely have to call the
elections before world leaders arrive for the G-8 summit in July.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion within the ruling party appears to be split.
</P>
<P>
   While some support Mori, others believe they can capitalize on a
sympathy vote if elections come soon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mori's public support looked shaky, with many voters
angry over the failure of party leaders to disclose Obuchi's
hospitalization for nearly a day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the government should have kept it as a
secret,'' said Keiko Yoshida, 40, a Tokyo bank worker. ''Things
were changing while we had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all major newspapers ran editorials today demanding
Mori call elections to prove his administration's mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although he climbed the political ladder successfully in terms
of factional politics, his mettle as a political leader is
untested,'' said Asahi, one of Japan's largest newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Vets Await Benefits  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A decade after the U.S. victory in the Persian
Gulf, veterans of the Iraqi war have the first glimmer of hope that
sufferers from a variety of ailments known as Gulf War illnesses
may automatically qualify for government compensation.
</P>
<P>
   A new study to determine the rate of Lou Gehrig's disease among
those who served in the conflict could open the door to automatic
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes too late for Rob Booker, who tried for
nearly two years to qualify for compensation, arguing the Lou
Gehrig's disease ravaging his body was connected to his service in
the Gulf. The Department of Veterans Affairs investigation of his
case dragged on because in almost all cases, Gulf War illnesses
aren't automatically recognized by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The VA finally agreed this week to grant Booker benefits.
Unfortunately, the former Army national guardsman from Evergreen,
Ala., died in February at age 35, leaving behind his wife, two
daughters -- ages 2 and 7 -- and lots of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The family's compensation will amount to $1,300 a month in
survivors' benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In the study announced last month, the VA and other agencies
will try to compare the rate of Gehrig's disease among the 700,000
veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf War to those diagnosed in the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   At least 28 Gulf conflict veterans have been diagnosed with
possible amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which destroys the
brain and spinal cord nerve cells. It is the most deadly of
so-called Gulf War illnesses, which also include severe reactions
to certain smells, night sweats, lower back pain, diarrhea, cramps,
fatigue and memory loss
</P>
<P>
   If researchers establish a higher incidence among veterans,
their finding could trigger a presumption that it was
service-connected and lead to automatic compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see this as a solid victory and a very positive move by the
VA,'' said Paul Sullivan, spokesman for the National Gulf War
Resources Center, a nonprofit group. ''It clearly opens the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Gulf veterans still must prove that ailments or
injuries are connected to their service. About 136,000 veterans of
the war have succeeded in securing disability payments.
</P>
<P>
   For Booker's wife, Lynn, a study seems like a waste while sick
and dying veterans are denied compensation. ''They should use the
money to help guys who need it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers share the Bookers' frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., criticizes the VA for not
giving Gulf veterans ''the benefit of the doubt. The worst that
could happen is you help someone who needs help.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Bernard Sanders, a Vermont independent, said he is
concerned that researchers on Gulf War illness ''are not getting
the kind of support we need from VA and the Department of
Defense.''
</P>
<P>
   One researcher, Dr. Robert Haley, has concluded that Gulf
veterans suffered brain injuries due to chemical exposure during
the war. The chief of clinical epidemiology at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center also found the veterans have a
higher death rate from auto accidents and suicides.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who have brain injuries have higher rates of automobile
accidents and a higher rate of depression and suicide,'' Haley
said. ''We proposed that as an explanation and they (the VA) have
not accepted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John R. Feussner, the VA's chief research and development
officer, said the agency has been ''very receptive to following
leads that might help explain Gulf War illness.'' He said the
agency is spending $160 million for 150 projects.
</P>
<P>
   Those researchers are trying to learn whether Gulf veterans'
ailments resulted from exposure to depleted uranium, tropical
diseases, oil well fires or chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gulf War syndrome isn't as precise as fever or pneumonia. My
fear is that people misunderstand how long it may take to clarify a
difficult issue'' and view the VA as ''bad or inattentive,''
Feussner said.	   He said that the 28 likely ALS diagnoses made so far would
approximate the rate expected for the general population. But the
VA proceeded with the study because of other warning flags,
including that veterans with the disease were generally younger
than average ALS sufferers.

<HEADLINE> Students Flunk Personal Finance  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Financial news fills the airwaves and stocks
can be traded from home computers, yet many high school seniors'
knowledge about money management, investing and saving has gone
from bad to worse, a national survey suggests.
</P>
<P>
   In a 45-minute multiple choice examination administered in
February and March, 723 soon-to-graduate seniors on average
answered correctly only 52 percent of the 30 questions about
personal finance and economics. That's a failing grade based on the
typical high-school grading scale. Three years ago, 1,509 seniors
took a similar examination and the average score was 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given all the media are doing to popularize personal finance
and all the attention riveted on the stock market, you'd think they
would be more interested and would be learning more,'' said Sandra
Shaber, an economist with the WEFA Group who once taught economics
to high school students.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Cecchetti, professor of economics at Ohio State
University, and some other experts believe the low scores could be
improved if schools were to focus more on teaching students early
on about personal finance and economics or integrate some of the
basic concepts in other coursework such as math.
</P>
<P>
   Both surveys were sponsored by the Jump$tart Coalition for
Personal Financial Literacy, a nonprofit group that wants students
to have the skills to be financially competent. Lewis Mandell, dean
of the University of Buffalo's School of Management, conducted the
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   The latest survey will be released today at the Federal Reserve.
A copy was obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In the financial world, ''there's so much choice it's
bewildering. If people are well informed, they can take advantage
of the choices, if not they become vulnerable,'' Mandell said.
''They'll invest their money in a stock they saw on TV, take on far
more debt than they can conceivably handle in the future and invest
401(k) money in things that won't yield the return needed to retire
in some years hence.''
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, only 21 percent knew they might have to pay
income tax on savings account interest, though nearly 55 percent
had both a savings and a checking account. Three years ago, 32
percent answered the question right.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six percent knew that retirement income paid by a company
is called a pension, but 30 percent thought it was called Social
Security. In the 1997 survey, about 64 percent answered the
question right.
</P>
<P>
   Just 32 percent knew that people turned down for credit based on
a credit report can check their credit record for free, down from
about 36 percent in the previous survey. Yet, 49 percent in the
latest survey said they have their own credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Some other results in the current survey:
</P>
<P>
   -- 46 percent mistakenly said a bank certificate of deposit is
not protected by the government and 21 percent thought U.S. savings
and Treasury bonds are unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   -- 63 percent said they would have no liability if their credit
card was stolen and a thief ran up a $1,000 bill. (Liability is
limited to $50 after the credit-card issuer is notified. Only 15
percent knew they would be responsible to pay $50.)
</P>
<P>
   --23 percent correctly said stocks likely would offer the highest
growth over 18 years of saving for a child's education. But 73
percent said a U.S. savings bond or a savings account would offer
the highest growth.

<HEADLINE> Probe of alleged retaliation against Smith &AMP; Wesson grows  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn (AP) -- An investigation of the gun industry is
intensifying, with more states joining the effort and subpoenas
issued around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in at least six states are now investigating whether
the gun industry is illegally trying to punish Smith &AMP; Wesson for
agreeing to make its weapons more childproof.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 subpoenas have been issued for firearms
manufacturers, distributors and others, Connecticut Attorney
General Richard Blumenthal said Wednesday. The federal government
is also looking at the issue, he said. A call to the Justice
Department was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Exercising corporate responsibility should not be reason for
your competitors to put a bull's eye on your back,'' said Nathan
Barankin, a spokesman for California Attorney General Bill Lockyer.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed in March to include safety locks with all
handguns -- external locks at first, and internal ones within two
years. New guns will not accept magazines holding more than 10
rounds of ammunition. In addition, the company agreed to invest in
''smart gun'' technology that allows only the owner to pull the
trigger, and to eliminate advertising that might attract children
or criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, a number of municipalities, states and the federal
government agreed not to sue Smith &AMP; Wesson over gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Gun groups and Smith &AMP; Wesson competitors protested the
agreement. Gun Owners of America urged its 200,000 members to
boycott Smith &AMP; Wesson and to ask their dealers to stop carrying
the company's products.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said he had received reports of communication among
companies, Web site postings, conversations or threats involving a
ban on magazine ads for Smith &AMP; Wesson, and attempts to discourage
lawyers from representing the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Under antitrust law, it would be illegal for companies to
collude to deprive Smith &AMP; Wesson of business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal and the attorneys general of New York and Maryland
began the investigation last week. Blumenthal said that California,
Florida and Massachusetts are joining the probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The indications are sufficiently strong that we believe a
full-scale effort is justified,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Gun Owners of America spokesman John Velleco said the group is
within its First Amendment rights to call for a boycott. He said
the industry is too fragmented to collude against the company.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gunmakers couldn't organize a one-car funeral,'' Velleco said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Schultz, president of Springfield, Mass.-based Smith &AMP;
Wesson, said his company did not ask for the investigation, but
''we certainly disagree with the kinds of things the attorneys
general think may be going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said Smith &AMP; Wesson has not seen a decline in sales. He
said he was aware of only two dealers who stopped doing business
with the company, and no problems with distributors.
</P>
<P>
   After the Smith Wesson deal was announced, the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development and the mayors of Atlanta, Detroit
and Miami moved to give preference to Smith &AMP; Wesson for new
weapons purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. said Smith &AMP;
Wesson should be celebrated, not condemned. ''They are moving in
the right direction, I believe, in terms of what most Americans
want,'' Curran said.
</P>
<P>
   University of Connecticut law professor Kurt Strasser said the
gun industry will probably argue that any retaliation stemmed from
individual decisions by gun buyers.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for RSR Group Inc., a wholesaler in Florida, said
it decided independently to no longer deal with Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is absolutely no activity of that sort on our part,''
Beatriz Atorresagasti said. ''We're not even advocating that anyone
stop buying Smith &AMP; Wesson products.''

<HEADLINE> Rowland supports tax credits for private school families  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Minutes after Gov. John G. Rowland
reiterated his strong support for a proposal would give a tax
credit of up to $500 to families who have a child to private
school, opponents were criticizing the plan outside his office.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Citizens Alliance for Public Education ,a group of
parents, teachers, school administrators and civic and religious
leaders, said Wednesday they believe tax money should only be used
in the state's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''This initiative is part of an attack on the institute of
public education,'' said Robert Leikind of the Anti-Defamation
League. ''We think that our public schools need to be invested in,
and strengthened so that all students ... get the benefits of our
tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said the state ranks second in the country in education
spending, employs the highest-paid teachers and has allotted $425
million for the construction of new public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tax credit based on any activity ... has no relation,
connection to any type of other funding,'' Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by three children clad in school uniforms, Rowland
emphasized that ''this is not a voucher program.''
</P>
<P>
   It has nothing to do with public education,'' he said. ''It does
not take a single penny away from public education.''
</P>
<P>
   What it does, he said, is offer some relief to many working
families throughout the state that spend as much as $20,000 a year
per child on private education. Single state income tax filers
making $50,000 or less and joint filers making $100,000 or less
would be eligible for the credit. Those with incomes too low to pay
state income tax would not be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said this measure ranks in his top three priorities,
along with cutting the gas tax and working on the development of
downtown Hartford. He is asking for a total of $16.5 million to be
spent on the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, there is significant bipartisan support for this
plan,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Tax breaks, Rowland said, are passed every year in Connecticut --
ranging from personal property credits to corporate relief.

<HEADLINE> Nussbaum appearance draws ire at Suffolk Community College  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELDEN, N.Y. (AP) -- Lisa Steinberg was 6 years old in 1987, when
she succumbed to the beatings inflicted by the man she considered
her father. If the fates had treated her differently, she might be
a college freshman today.
</P>
<P>
   Students and faculty at Suffolk Community College say they are
angry that Hedda Nussbaum, who stood by while Joel Steinberg
inflicted his abuse, has been invited to speak on the issue of
domestic violence next week for a $2,500 fee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are outraged,'' Professor Sandra Emmachild said of the
speech planned for Monday. ''We have access to many, many women who
actually took themselves out of abusive situations and saved their
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmachild, a professor of philosophy and women's studies, doubts
the sincerity of Nussbaum, 57, who testified against Steinberg in
the 1988 trial that saw him convicted of manslaughter in Lisa's
death. She told jurors that the battering and psychological abuse
Nussbaum endured during her 10-year relationship with Steinberg
left her helpless to come to the aid of the 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Originally charged in the death, Nussbaum was granted immunity
in exchange for her testimony. Steinberg is serving a 25-year
prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are convinced that the only reason she came forward was
that the child was dead,'' Emmachild said.
</P>
<P>
   ''God knows if she would have ever reported this if it were not
for the unfortunate death of this child. We believe she was acting
purely in her self interest,'' added Emmachild.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Antinozzi-Cortez, president of the student organization
Women's Group, said, ''She did not take any initiative to save this
child. I did an internship at a center for abused women. I know
what they went through to save themselves and their children. She
is not a role model.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike D'Andrea, owner of Best Booking Agency of Brookfield,
Conn., which represents Nussbaum, said Wednesday she would not
speak to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's not a role model and we're not trying to elevate her to
being a role model,'' D'Andrea said. ''Hopefully, people will hear
her story and get something out of it. It's a cautionary tale -- a
classic example that any person regardless of race, class or
ethnicity can find themselves in an abusive situation that's
difficult to get out of.''
</P>
<P>
   Nussbaum suffered extensive battering at the hands of Steinberg,
including a broken nose, ear injuries and gangrenous legs from
being struck repeatedly with an exercise bar.
</P>
<P>
   She has spoken on college campuses and to community groups and
civic organizations for about two years. ''Last year she spoke at
Stony Brook and was very well received.'' D'Andrea said. ''There
are very few people that you can bring in to address this kind of
issue with name recognition ... someone that will draw an
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 interview with The Associated Press, Nussbaum said she
had recovered from abuse and learned from doctors that her lack of
initiative was partly a physical response to the beatings -- ''It
makes you numb, in lots of ways,'' she said -- and so she feels
responsible but no longer feels guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Troncoso, executive director of the Student Activities
Board, which is paying Nussbaum from student activity fees and not
college funds, told Newsday she knew the decision was
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought she could speak better than anyone about domestic
violence and when to get out of a relationship,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another philosophy professor, who also serves as faculty adviser
to the women's group, had another reason for opposing Nussbaum's
appearance. ''It's a form of cheap sensationalism to have her
here,'' said Gertrude Postl. ''We're seeing an aspect of the talk
shows here; something that a college should not get involved in.''

<HEADLINE> Sharks 5, Stars 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Vincent Damphousse scored two goals and
had an assist as the San Jose Sharks clinched a playoff spot with a
5-2 victory over the Dallas Stars on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Ragnarsson, Brad Stuart and Patrick Marleau also scored
for the Sharks, who qualified for the postseason for the third
consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, combined with Edmonton's 3-2 loss to Colorado,
moves the Sharks up a spot and into seventh in the Western
Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose has 84 points, four more than ninth-place Vancouver
with two games left for each team. But the Sharks have the
tiebreaker edge by virtue of more wins, 34 to 29.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Thornton and Joe Nieuwendyk scored for the Stars, who lost
consecutive road games for the first time all season.
</P>
<P>
   Damphousse, who scored his 19th and 20th goals of the season,
gave the Sharks a 3-2 edge with 2:26 remaining in the second
period. Alexander Korolyuk knocked the puck loose near the blue
line and it floated straight to Damphousse, who attacked Chicago
goaltender Ed Belfour's stick side and managed to shoot the puck
high and just inside the post.
</P>
<P>
   Damphousse reached 20 goals for the first time since the 1996-97
season, when he had 27 for the Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars pulled ahead less than two minutes into the second
period when Nieuwendyk picked up a rebound and slipped the puck
past Sharks goalkeeper Steve Shields.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose responded with a goal 32 seconds later as Jeff Norton
skated along the boards with the puck, then centered a pass to
Marleau in the slot, who slapped it through Belfour's legs.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded power-play goals in the first period.
Damphousse gave the Sharks a 1-0 lead after he slipped the puck
past Belfour from behind the net. Korolyuk and Mike Ricci each took
shots that bounced loose before Damphousse sent it home.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas tied it after Derian Hatcher took a shot that glanced off
Shields' pads and Thornton slapped the rebound into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart scored 1:09 into the third period from the top of the
slot after taking a pass from Damphousse, who was behind the net.
Ragnarsson scored with 12:41 remaining.

<HEADLINE> Angels 12, Yankees 6  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Darin Erstad went 4-for-5 with a homer,
two doubles and five RBIs Wednesday night as Anaheim beat the New
York Yankees 12-6 and gave rookie Angels manager Mike Scioscia his
first victory.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim roughed up David Cone (0-1) for eight runs on five hits
and five walks in 2 2-3 innings. Cone, who threw 76 pitches, struck
out three.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Schoeneweis (1-0), making his first major league start,
gave up five runs on 10 hits, including consecutive solo homers by
Shane Spencer and Tino Martinez in the fourth, over six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, 9-for-14 this season, led off the Angels' first with a
420-foot homer over the wall in center.
</P>
<P>
   He made it 3-0 with a two-run double to right-center off Cone in
the second inning, then greeted reliever Alan Watson with another
two-run double down the right-field line during the Angels' six-run
third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Matching his career high for RBIs in a game -- he had five
against Toronto on Sept. 8, 1997 -- Erstad finished the opening
three-game series with a .643 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, 37, tired in the second half of last season, going 2-5
with a 4.83 ERA following his July 18 perfect game against
Montreal. The Yankees, who signed him to a $12 million, one-year
contract in the offseason, intend to give him extra rest between
starts whenever they can.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis, 1-1 with a 5.49 ERA as a rookie reliever last year,
struck out four and walked none as the Angels won the finale of the
three-game set against the Yankees, two-time defending world
champions.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn had two hits and scored three runs for Anaheim and
brought a huge cheer from the crowd of 24,560 with his first steal
in almost three years.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, hit by a pitch by Watson in the fourth inning, proceeded
to steal second, barreling in head-first well ahead of catcher
Jorge Posada's throw.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first stolen base for the 6-foot-1, 268-pound Vaughn
since May 26, 1997, and only his 29th in 1,188 career games.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Vaughn injured an ankle when he tumbled into a dugout
on opening day and never fully recovered the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson drove in two Angels runs, with an RBI single and
a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Posada went 4-for-4 and scored three runs for New York.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Yankees third baseman Scott Brosius was placed on the
15-day disabled list with a strained rib cage muscle. The Gold
Glove winner injured his left side during batting practice before
Tuesday's game and was scratched from the lineup. The Yankees
recalled Alfonso Soriano from Triple-A Columbus to replace Brosius
on the roster. ... Taking two of the three games in Anaheim, the
Yankees have won 18 of their last 25 games on the West Coast dating
back to 1998. ... Three years earlier, on April 5 of 1997, Angels
reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa made his debut for the team, becoming
just the fourth Japanese-born player ever in the majors. The others
were Hideo Nomo, Makato Suzuki, and Masanori Murakami.

Castro: Elian, Dad To Be Reunited
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro declared Wednesday night that it is
just matter of days before Elian Gonzalez will be reunited with his father. ''I
am talking about three days'' more or less, Castro told hundreds of university
students from across Latin American and the Caribbean in town for a regional
congress. ''It is inevitable.'' ''The battle of Elian has been won -- in
judicial terms, in legal terms, in political terms,'' Castro said. Castro's
statement came less than an hour after Gregory Craig, attorney for Elian's
father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, announced in Washington that the father would be
traveling to the United States Thursday with his wife, their 6-month-old son,
and with Fernando Remirez, chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington.

House Passes 'Partial Birth' Abortion Ban

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a bi-partisan effort, the House voted 287-141 to pass a
ban on so-called ''partial birth'' abortions. The vote marks the third time in
five years the House has backed the ban. While the majority was wide enough to
override President Clinton's threatened veto, the bill's supporters appear to be
short of the strength they would need to prevail in the Senate. The vote came a
few weeks before the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on a ban of
such abortions passed by the Nebraska legislature, a law rejected by a federal

council set up two tents and a generator on Havat Maon, a hill south of Hebron

it was on an army firing range. They said the government had violated the terms

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Jay Buhner homered and drove in four runs
Wednesday night, and the Seattle Mariners bounced back from a
season-opening loss to Pedro Martinez, beating the Boston Red Sox
9-3.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner had been part of Seattle's opening-day lineup for nine
straight seasons but was held out of Tuesday's game because he was
0-for-8 against Martinez, striking out all eight times.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, the beneficiary of seven walks, overcame a pair of solo
home runs by Brian Daubach. Alex Rodriguez and John Olerud also
homered for the Mariners, and John Valentin homered for the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 29,242 was the smallest at Safeco Field in 44 dates
since the ballpark opened last July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Kazuhiro Sasaki, the Japanese closer Seattle signed during the
offseason, made his Mariners' debut, pitching a one-hit ninth with
one strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle loaded the bases in the first against Ramon Martinez
(0-1) when Mike Cameron singled, Mark McLemore walked and Rodriguez
was hit by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud hit a sacrifice fly, John Mabry singled for a 2-0 lead
and Buhner hit a three-run, opposite-field homer on a 1-2 pitch.
Buhner is 3-for-6 with a double and two homers against Ramon
Martinez, Pedro's brother.
</P>
<P>
   Freddy Garcia (1-0), runner-up in AL Rookie of the Year voting
last season, allowed two runs and two hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   After Daubach's solo homer pulled Boston to 6-1 in the second,
Martinez loaded the bases in the bottom half on walks to McLemore,
Rodriguez and Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   John Wasdin relieved and forced in runs with walks to Olerud and
Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez gave up seven runs, three hits and four walks in 1 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach hit a 438-foot drive to right-center field in the fourth
for the first multihomer game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez homered in the fourth off Wasdin and Olerud in the
sixth off Wakefield for a 9-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin hit a solo homer off Frankie Rodriguez in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cameron, acquired in the Ken Griffey Jr. trade, singled in
the first for his first Mariners hit. ... OF Anthony Sanders
cleared waivers and was sent outright to Triple-A Tacoma. ... Nomar
Garciaparra, the defending AL batting champion (.357), is 0-for-8.
... Daubach is 14-for-28 (.500) with four homers and 14 RBIs in his
career against Seattle.

<HEADLINE> GOP Defeats Campaign Finance Measure  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are opposing an attempt by
Democrats to force a growing type of tax-exempt political
organization to disclose contributors and expenditures, even though
the groups are targeting politicians in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   GOP members of the House Ways and Means Committee voted against
the measure Wednesday, arguing that it should await broader
campaign finance reform and could drag down an underlying bill that
would expand taxpayer rights and give people breaks on IRS
penalties and interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's not weigh down this taxpayer rights bill with
politically charged issues that could be a poison pill,'' said Rep.
Rob Portman, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted 21-15 along party lines to defeat an
amendment by Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, that would require
financial disclosure for tax-exempt groups organized under Section
527 of the tax code. The groups would have to submit financial
information to the Federal Election Commission and detail their
existence to the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett, who may get another chance to offer his amendment next
week on the House floor, said these groups are becoming the
''political super-weapon'' of the 2000 election, one that can
''fill the airwaves with hate and the mailboxes with
disinformation'' without disclosure -- so long as they don't
expressly advocate voting for or against a particular candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 is more than 25 years old, but the law has recently
been embraced by political organizations of every stripe following
court decisions and an IRS opinion that paved the way. They are now
involved in political causes and campaigns across the political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a group with Republican ties called Shape the
Debate is running TV ads critical of Vice President Al Gore in
California, New York and Washington. Another one called Citizens
for Better Medicare, created by drug manufacturers and their
allies, plans to spend millions of dollars to work against any
legislation that would control prescription prices.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumptive Democratic 2000 presidential nominee, has
called Section 527 groups ''the equivalent of Swiss bank accounts
for campaigns,'' and Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation has also
recommended a series of reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett said putting the issue off was an effort to ''delay,
defer, duck, dodge -- use all kinds of excuses'' to avoid wading
into the controversies of campaign finance reform. He repeatedly
invoked the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
whose reform message of minimizing big money in politics helped
attract new voters to the GOP -- and who was criticized in ads run
earlier this year by Section 527 groups.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the underlying bill would provide taxpayers
with new protections against improper disclosure of tax
information, allow interest on past-due taxes to be waived if the
IRS made a mistake and prohibit any taxes on interest payments made
by the IRS to the taxpayer. Its total price tag is estimated at
$2.1 billion over five years.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-China Trade Decision Applauded  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A move by House Speaker Dennis Hastert to
bring legislation granting permanent trade benefits to China to a
vote next month is being applauded by President Clinton and other
supporters of the legislation. ''This is very good news,'' says
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, backers don't underestimate the difficult job that lies
ahead in corralling votes, particularly among Democrats. Strong
election-year opposition from organized labor has helped generate
sizable Democratic resistance to the measure in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, R-Ill., ended weeks of uncertainty on Tuesday by
announcing that the House would take up the China trade bill the
week of May 22-26.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it's up to Clinton and Democratic congressional
leaders to help deliver the votes. ''This will have to be a
bipartisan effort. We will need the help of some Democrats to pass
this legislation,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, where the legislation has always had more support
than in the House, two committees today were holding hearings on
the China trade deal: Foreign Relations and Finance.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would grant China ''permanent normal trade relations,''
ending annual congressional votes on Beijing's trade status. China
is one of only a handful of countries on which such annual votes
are still taken.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions, environmental groups, and some human-rights
organizations do not want to give up what they view as leverage
over China from the annual review process. Labor also fears that
increased trade with China will hurt U.S. jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters claim that the measure, along with the related
entry of China into the World Trade Organization, will open vast
Chinese markets to U.S. exporters and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Economically, it's a no brainer,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Wednesday in an interview with AP editors
and reporters. ''It's an opening up of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Albright conceded that ''we have to keep working it'' to
build support, given labor's strong opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking to ultimate victory,'' Hastert told reporters as
he announced the timetable.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Hastert had indicated he wouldn't move toward a
vote unless he was certain of getting 90-100 Democratic votes.
Democratic sponsors have said that they doubt that they can deliver
more than 70-80 of the chamber's 211 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, they can't look to the usual leaders for help.
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., remains undecided on the
bill, spokeswoman Laura Nichols said on Wednesday. And the No. 2
Democratic leader, Minority Whip David Bonior of Michigan, is a
leader of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior claims that as many as 150 Democrats may end up voting
''no.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert dropped any mention of a Democratic threshold of support
in his Wednesday remarks, cheering supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The May schedule also meets administration hopes for a vote
before the election season heats up this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Setting a week in May for a vote is an important step
forward,'' said Commerce Secretary William Daley in a statement
from Beijing, where he was discussions trade with Chinese
officials. ''Over the next few weeks we will have to stay focused
and continue to convincingly make our case to the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton welcomed Hastert's move and announced it at a White
House conference on the new economy. ''I want to thank the speaker
and the leadership of the House for doing this, and I assure you I
will do what I can to pass it,'' the president said.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton plans daily protests for Easter week  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a move that recalls the month of daily
protests led by the Rev. Al Sharpton in front of Police
Headquarters last year, he has announced plans for a busy week of
civil disobedience leading up to Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going back to the streets,'' Sharpton said Wednesday at
a news conference where he was joined by Martin Luther King III and
the families of police shooting victims Amadou Diallo and Patrick
Dorismond. ''This is necessary to put the pressure on the federal
government so that they know that our lives are on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said demonstrations would begin at Federal Plaza in
downtown Manhattan on Monday, April 17, and continue all week with
actions on Wall Street and in the Theater District, among other
locations. Protesters will urge the U.S. Department of Justice to
monitor the New York Police Department and press criminal civil
rights charges against the four officers who killed Diallo in a
barrage of 41 bullets. An Albany jury acquitted them of murder
charges in a state trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''I call on (Attorney General) Janet Reno to hear the voice of a
mother, woman to woman,'' said Diallo's mother, Kadiatou Diallo.
''Please, you have to hear our calls,'' she said. ''Every night I'm
waking up, every night I'm crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sharpton organized a month of daily protests outside
Police Headquarters after Diallo's death. More than 1,200 people
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton also urged New Yorkers to forego buying special Easter
clothes and supplies this year to send a message that life should
not continue as usual in the face of racial profiling and police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to wear overalls on Easter Sunday,'' he said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's parents, his two daughters, and his brother and
sister sat beside Sharpton as he spoke, as did King, the son of the
slain civil rights leader. Dorismond, an unarmed, off-duty security
guard, was killed by undercover police in a botched drug sting last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton and King said they planned to lead a rally against
racial profiling and police misconduct near the Lincoln Memorial in
Washington on Aug. 28, the 37th anniversary of Martin Luther King
Jr.'s ''I Have a Dream'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that my father would be here if he were alive, joining
these families, calling for the Justice Department to come in,''
the younger King said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, about 700 people rallied near City Hall, and
one group was removed by police after briefly blocking traffic on
the Brooklyn Bridge. Eighteen people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The angry protesters, many of them high school and college
students, chanted ''Giuliani must go!'' referring to New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, and waved signs that said ''Stop the murder of
our youth!'' Also present were people who said they had lost
relatives in confrontations with police.
</P>
<P>
   The rally began at Union Square, and demonstrators walked down
Broadway to City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just enraged about what's been going on in this city,''
said Meryl Feigenberg, 17, of the Bronx, a student at La Guardia
High School.
</P>
<P>
   ''Four cops killed a man and nothing happened to them,'' she
said. ''We're showing them we're taking a stand for this and won't
let it happen anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Aussie Museum To Return Maori Heads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- An Australian museum has agreed
to return five tattooed and preserved Maori heads to New Zealand, a
spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the heads from the South Australian Museum in
Adelaide later this month marks another milestone in an ongoing
campaign to repatriate all the tattooed heads of Maori from museums
and galleries round the world.
</P>
<P>
   Maori, the original inhabitants of New Zealand, preserved the
heads of their dead through a drying process and often kept the
heads of their loved ones around the home.
</P>
<P>
   The South Australian Museum will hand over the heads -- known as
''moko mokai'' -- on long-term loan at a ceremony on April 17. The
heads will be held by Te Papa, the Museum of New Zealand, in
Wellington, where dozens of other repatriated heads are stored.
</P>
<P>
   The largest collection outside New Zealand, numbering 35 heads,
is at New York's American Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Moko Mokai Education Trust spokesman Dalvanius Prime said final
negotiations were under way for the return of the American Museum
of Natural History's collection, and the heads should be
repatriated early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Prime also said the tattooed and preserved head of a white New
Zealander was secretly repatriated from Australia in February and
buried on land alongside the Whanganui River 160 miles north of
Wellington.
</P>
<P>
   Though Maori often kept the heads of their loved ones, enemies
or slaves were not so revered. Many Maori traded their tattooed
heads for European goods like muskets, meaning many heads are now
in museums around the world.

<HEADLINE> Gun Industry Punishment Probe Grows  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Smith &AMP; Wesson was lauded by many for
exercising corporate responsibility earlier this year for agreeing
to make its weapons more childproof
</P>
<P>
   Gun groups and competitors, however, protested the deal. One
group, Gun Owners of America, even urged its 200,000 members to
boycott Smith &AMP; Wesson and to ask their dealers to stop carrying
the company's products.
</P>
<P>
   Now prosecutors in at least six states are investigating whether
the gun industry is illegally trying to punish Smith &AMP; Wesson.
Under antitrust law, it would be illegal for companies to collude
to deprive Smith &AMP; Wesson of business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Exercising corporate responsibility should not be reason for
your competitors to put a bull's eye on your back,'' said Nathan
Barankin, a spokesman for California Attorney General Bill Lockyer.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 subpoenas have been issued for firearms
manufacturers, distributors and others, Connecticut Attorney
General Richard Blumenthal said Wednesday. He said the federal
government also is studying the issue, but the Justice Department
did not return a message seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson last month agreed to include safety locks with
all handguns -- external locks at first, and internal ones within
two years. New guns will not accept magazines holding more than 10
rounds of ammunition. Additionally, the company agreed to invest in
''smart gun'' technology that allows only the owner to pull the
trigger, and to eliminate advertising that might attract children
or criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, a number of municipalities, states and the federal
governments agreed not to sue the company over gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Blumenthal said he had received reports of communication
among companies, Internet postings, conversations or threats
involving a ban on magazine ads for Smith &AMP; Wesson, and attempts to
discourage lawyers from representing the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal and the attorneys general of New York and Maryland
began the investigation last week. Blumenthal said that California,
Florida and Massachusetts are joining the probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The indications are sufficiently strong that we believe a
full-scale effort is justified,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Gun Owners of America spokesman John Velleco said the group is
within its First Amendment rights to call for a boycott. He said
the industry is too fragmented to collude against the company.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gunmakers couldn't organize a one-car funeral,'' Velleco said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Schultz, president of Springfield, Mass.-based Smith &AMP;
Wesson, said his company did not ask for the investigation, but
''we certainly disagree with the kinds of things the attorneys
general think may be going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said he was aware of only two dealers who stopped doing
business with the company, and no problems with distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz also said Smith &AMP; Wesson has not seen a decline in
sales. Since the agreement, the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development and the mayors of Atlanta, Detroit and Miami have
taken steps to give preference to Smith &AMP; Wesson for new weapons
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the gun industry will probably argue that any
retaliation stemmed from individual decisions by gun buyers, said
University of Connecticut law professor Kurt Strasser.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for RSR Group Inc., a wholesaler in Florida, said
it decided independently to no longer deal with Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is absolutely no activity of that sort on our part,''
Beatriz Atorresagasti said. ''We're not even advocating that anyone
stop buying Smith &AMP; Wesson products.''

<HEADLINE> Jewish Groups Lament Anti-Semitism  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To a hushed hearing room, Holocaust survivor
Elie Wiesel suggested a panel of legislators read the Congressional
Record from the years 1939 to 1945 -- part of the Hitler era.
</P>
<P>
   ''The senators who had power ... did they speak up?'' about Nazi
hatred and persecution, Wiesel asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''They knew ... Washington knew,'' Wiesel told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, urging lawmakers to fight re-emerging
anti-Semitism and other prejudice around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''I belong to a traumatized generation that has witnessed the
defeat of Nazism and communism, but not that of hatred,'' said
Wiesel, winner of the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize. ''Had I considered
the possibility hatred would re-emerge so soon, I would not have
believed it.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing brought together a disparate group of witnesses to
talk about the ''Legacy of the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewish groups urged the U.S. government to speak out against
what they said is a revival of anti-Semitism in the Middle East,
former Soviet Union and elsewhere. U.S. government officials
brought the committee up to date on programs around the world to
compensate Holocaust survivors and on the progress of the
presidential commission that is investigating Holocaust-related
issues in the states.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hatred did not die in Auschwitz,'' Wiesel told the committee.
''Jews perished there, not anti-Semitism. Hatred is still alive and
well.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Nazis and neo-Nazis are everywhere,'' he said. ''I don't know
who finances them, but they are active and vocal and we find them
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He raised the question of what should be done about those who
deny the Holocaust or espouse hatred and prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Should there be a way of checking when and where their words
cross the line of free speech, which is so important to us?'' he
asked. ''When it becomes a cycle of hate and violence, what are we
to do? What can you do as the lawmakers of this land?''
</P>
<P>
   American Jewish Committee Executive Director David A. Harris
urged the panel to look at what his organization called the
''shocking revival of vitriolic anti-Semitism and Holocaust
denial'' across the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Islamic anti-Semitic activity in the Middle East can no longer
be ignored or downplayed or viewed as little more than an Arab
negotiating tactic in the complex Arab-Israeli peace talks,'' he
said in his prepared testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an urgent need to reject this behavior
unconditionally,'' he said, citing comments by the Mufti of
Jerusalem trivializing the Holocaust during the Pope's pilgrimage
there last month.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Conference on Soviet Jewry said U.S. officials
should emphasize to their counterparts in former Soviet states the
importance of democracy and minority rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would never have imagined a post-Soviet landscape littered
with neo-Nazi and fascist-oriented extremists visibly trying to
revive the ... ideology against which the Russian people battled so
fiercely,'' said Mark B. Levin, executive director of the group,
which advocates on behalf of Jews in Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic
States and Eurasia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is with sadness and frustration that we must face reality
... ethnic hatred in Kosovo and Rwanda, nationalist hatred in
Chechnya, political hatred in the Middle East,'' Wiesel said.

<HEADLINE> Jury Weighs Damages in Smoker Case  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A federal judge decided to lift a gag order in a
landmark tobacco industry trial hours after a state jury began
deliberating whether to award damages to three smokers with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The jury began deliberations Monday on a request for $13.2
million in compensatory damages against the nation's five biggest
cigarette makers. The deliberations were to resume today.
</P>
<P>
   The pivotal question on a complicated 18-page verdict form asks
whether smoking was the legal cause of cancer in Frank Amodeo, Mary
Farnan and the late Angie Della Vecchia.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the compensatory request, the industry fears a $300
billion punitive award for an estimated 500,000 sick Florida
smokers. It is the first such case to make it trial.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, the nation's No. 1 tobacco producer, passed a
law Wednesday to shield the state's cigarette makers from the
potentially crippling jury award in the Florida case. The law sets
a cap of $25 million on the amount a company has to post as bond
while appealing a punitive-damage verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Virginia, Kentucky and Georgia have quickly approved
laws limiting the bond cigarette companies would have to post.
Virginia and Georgia approved a $25 million limit; Kentucky set it
at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The news media welcomed the judge's decision allowing attorneys,
their companies and smokers in the case to speak publicly for the
first time in 18 months, but trial lawyers didn't rush to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a 20-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Adalberto Jordan ruled
state Circuit Judge Robert Kaye's ''broadly sweeping injunction on
speech'' silencing the parties since October 1998 was ''facially
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted the gag order was overbroad and never-ending and saw
newsworthiness in ''the unprecedented scope of the plaintiff class
(of smokers) and the staggering amount of money at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones &AMP; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, led five
publishing companies in challenging the gag order.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers' attorney Susan Rosenblatt declined comment until the
issue is raised again with Kaye. A call for comment from lead
industry attorney Dan Webb was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson, Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc.
and the industry's Council for Tobacco Research and Tobacco
Institute.

<HEADLINE> 'Partial Birth' Abortion Ban Passed  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Echoing a political battle fought before,
Republicans urged President Clinton to ''do the right thing'' and
sign a bill banning so-called partial birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But their call is certain to go unheeded. Clinton has vetoed the
bill twice before and the White House earlier released a statement
saying he would do so again.
</P>
<P>
   The latest vote Wednesday, a bipartisan 287-141, was enough to
override a veto, which the House has done each time. The Senate,
however, has narrowly sustained Clinton's vetoes in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters insisted they were wading into the politically
charged debate again as a matter of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Partial birth abortion is a barbaric procedure that has no
place in a civilized society,'' said House Majority Leader Dick
Armey of Texas. ''I hope the president will search his heart and do
the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Rep. Henry Hyde, D-Ill., ''God put us in the world to do
noble things, to love and to cherish our fellow human beings, not
to destroy them. Today we must choose sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic opponents countered that Republicans were playing
politics in an election year, particularly by offering gruesome
accounts of the procedure. They said it was part of an overall goal
by the GOP to ban all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here we go again. Every election cycle, the Republicans want
the House to participate in their ritualistic attack on women,''
said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do not be fooled,'' added Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. ''This
is nothing less than an attempt to outlaw all abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved a similar bill last fall, and a compromise
is expected before fall. The only difference between the two bills
is a Senate-passed provision -- engineered by Democrats -- declaring
that the high court's Roe vs. Wade ruling in 1973 established ''an
important constitutional right'' and should not be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   As drafted, the House bill seeks to ban abortions in which a
doctor ''vaginally delivers some portion of an intact living fetus
until the fetus is partially outside the body of the mother'' and
''kills the fetus while the intact living fetus is partially
outside the body of the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The only exceptions would be in cases in which the life of the
mother was threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional debate comes as the Supreme Court prepares
later this month to consider a Nebraska case that could determine
the fate of 30 states' bans on a surgical procedure opponents call
''partial birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue, Neb., doctor Leroy Carhart has challenged his state's
law, saying it is written so broadly it could be enforced against
more than one abortion procedure and is too vague to let doctors
know just what abortion techniques are outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no direct connection between the court case and
the pending legislation, sponsors say the measure before the House
was crafted to meet objections of federal appeals court judges who
said the Nebraska statute failed to meet constitutional standards.
</P>
<P>
   Since gaining their majority in the House and Senate in 1994,
Republicans have twice pushed partial birth measures to Clinton
desk, causing political anguish in the process for many Democrats
who favor abortion rights but found the bills impossible to oppose.
</P>
<P>
   With the latest bill, House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt
voted for the measure, as he has with similar bills in the past. In
all, 209 Republicans, 77 Democrats and one independent voted for
the measure, while 132 Democrats, eight Republicans and one
independent were opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 3660

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Elian's Dad To Fly to U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Declaring victory in the battle over 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez, President Fidel Castro predicted it would only be a
matter of days before the boy is embraced by his father.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez planned to fly today to the United States
to reclaim his son.
</P>
<P>
   ''The battle of Elian has been won -- in judicial terms, in legal
terms, in political terms,'' Castro told hundreds of students from
across Latin America and the Caribbean who were attending a
regional congress.
</P>
<P>
   After being seen off personally by Castro, Elian's father,
stepmother and 6-month-old half brother were to leave Havana in a
private plane early today and arrive in Washington accompanied by
Fernando Remirez, chief of the Cuban Interests Section in
Washington, who offered the family his home during their U.S. stay.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said Gonzalez would be reunited with his son, who is
staying with relatives in Miami, in about three days. Gonzalez has
demanded his boy's return to Cuba since the child was rescued off
Florida's coast in late November.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader has made the fight for Elian a national
campaign, with marches, rallies and televised roundtables held
almost daily to call for the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez family was to live in the Washington area for a
month or two while awaiting the results of an appeal filed by Miami
relatives who have fought to keep the boy in United States. A
federal appeals court in Atlanta is to begin hearing arguments on
the case next month.
</P>
<P>
   Three others -- a school-aged male cousin, a pediatrician and a
kindergarten teacher -- were granted visas to travel to the United
States with the Gonzalez family. But they were not among those
leaving today, and it was unclear why.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials had requested visas for 22 others, including 12
children who were classmates of Elian in Cuba. Castro had said all
were ''indispensable'' for Elian's ''recovery'' after four months
away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday that six
were approved because ''it seemed like a group that would serve a
purpose for Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, attorney for Gonzalez, announced today's trip
Wednesday night after returning from a quick trip to Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time for this reunion to go forward,'' Craig said. The
attorney said Gonzalez ''is prepared to stay here until he has
achieved that objective.''
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service said earlier this
week that once Gonzalez arrives in the United States, it will begin
the process to transfer Elian to his custody.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had earlier said he would not travel to the United
States until he received assurances that custody of Elian would be
transferred from Lazaro Gonzalez, who has cared for Elian since the
boy's mother and 10 others died when their boat sank during an
illegal crossing from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona welcomed the news that Elian's
father was headed to the United States but said it did not mean
that father and son would be reunited immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still working out the most appropriate manner in which
to proceed with the actual transfer,'' Cardona said. ''This is an
issue that we will be addressing with the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations to determine how best to transfer temporary custody
to Elian's father were to resume early today. Two previous days of
talks between lawyers for the government and for Elian's Miami
relatives have failed to work out details.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives oppose returning the boy to Cuba and have
appealed a federal court ruling that says he should be reunited
with his father. Cuban-American protesters have threatened to form
a human chain around the Miami home where Elian is staying to
prevent him from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the house in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood, news of
Gonzalez's imminent trip filtered through a crowd of more than 150
people clustered behind police barricades.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must prepare,'' demonstrator Gerardo Barrios shouted into a
bullhorn.
</P>
<P>
   Another man read a prayer to supporters gathered under the white
glow of TV lights. ''Protect this boy, Lord,'' they sang in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the relatives, Armando Gutierrez, said they
would ask Elian's father to come to Miami to ''meet in the house
and try to work it out as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Castro activists also protested outside Attorney General
Janet Reno's Florida home, carrying signs depicting her as the
devil.

<HEADLINE> Gas Tax Rollback Faces Uphill Climb  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's
election-year proposal to roll back federal gasoline taxes because
of soaring pump prices is facing an increasingly uphill climb.
</P>
<P>
   As it continued debate today on a $1.83 trillion budget for next
year, the Senate was likely to easily approve a bipartisan
amendment opposing Lott's plan. The Mississippi Republican has
proposed erasing the 4.3 cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase
enacted in 1993, and suspending the entire 18.4 cent-a-gallon tax
if the average pump price of a gallon of regular unleaded tops $2
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Faith in snake oil never seems to diminish in the halls of
Congress,'' Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said Wednesday, arguing that
reducing the gasoline tax would have little impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''We might as well hire a witch doctor to shake a tambourine
over the heads'' of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries as reduce the gasoline tax, he said. Cutbacks in OPEC oil
production led to big spike in gasoline and home heating oil prices
over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Though Byrd's provision was non-binding and Lott and his
supporters were unlikely to give up completely, the vote was
expected to spotlight how difficult it will be for him to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   House GOP leaders already have all but abandoned the idea amid
lawmakers' concerns that it could dry up federal road-building
funds. Instead, they have focused on tax breaks for producers and
proposals to open up more federal lands to oil drilling.
</P>
<P>
   In a related amendment, Sen. William Roth, R-Del., was trying to
kill a budget provision that assumes the government will earn $1.2
billion by allowing oil to be taken from the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. That fight pits the Clinton
administration and environmentalists against the oil industry and
its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of barrels of oil could lie under the Arctic refuge,
but no drilling is allowed there. Supporters of drilling in the
refuge say it is a potential answer to the United States'
dependence on foreign sources of oil.
</P>
<P>
   ''This senator is not going to stand by and support increased
dependence on Iraq,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The battleground for the oil fights was the 2001 budget, which
sets tax and spending totals but leaves details for later
legislation. The House approved a similar spending plan on March
24. President Clinton's signature is not required.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to rising gasoline prices has blossomed into a
political battle, with Republicans accusing Clinton and Vice
President Gore of having an ineffective energy policy. Gore, the
presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, cast the Senate's
tie-breaking vote when Congress boosted the gasoline tax seven
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has blamed Congress for letting his authority lapse last
week to tap government oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd and his supporters say the gasoline tax rollback would have
little effect on consumers or OPEC. It also could cost billions of
dollars in federal revenue used for road projects, they say.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC is the 11-member organization that cut oil production last
year in an effort to boost prices. Since then, gasoline pump prices
have ballooned as crude oil prices tripled beyond $30 a barrel,
though they have since fallen to the mid-$20s.

<HEADLINE> NH Justice Tells of Violations  </HEADLINE>
By HOLLY RAMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. -- A constitutional crisis over alleged ethics
violations at the New Hampshire Supreme Court may worsen following
damaging disclosures by the state's top prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Philip McLaughlin touched off the
unprecedented crisis last Friday with a report concluding it was an
''institutional practice'' for the court's justices to participate
in cases in which they had a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   For five days, past and present justices said they read and
commented on such cases only to make grammar, punctuation or
similarly benign corrections. But Justice Sherman Horton told
investigators otherwise last month, according to an interview in
119 pages of investigative documents released by McLaughlin on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Horton said justices who disqualified themselves from cases
still offered opinions ''about why, as a matter of law, he
disagrees with the result,'' an investigator wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Justice Horton went on to say it's probably not right, but
it's done with a purpose to improve the outcome of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Horton, who did not return a phone message left at his home
Wednesday night, did not cite any cases. But his comments were at
odds with ones he made to investigators a week earlier when he said
comments by recused justices were ''not intended to change the
outcome'' of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the disclosure, however, some legislators called on
Chief Justice David Brock to resign or face impeachment, and said
two other justices on the five-member court also were tainted.
Legislative leaders said they wanted to get all the facts before
acting.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin's report Friday accused Justice Stephen Thayer of
criminal ethics violations, including trying to exert improper
influence in his wife's appeal of their divorce case. Thayer's
lawyer said he would have been acquitted, but Thayer resigned
rather than face prosecution and further damage the court's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the new documents, Thayer insisted several times to
other justices he was not alone in making substantive comments on
cases after disqualifying himself.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer refused to be interviewed by prosecutors and, through his
lawyer, declined to comment Wednesday. But according to one
document, Horton recalled Thayer saying, ''There are many instances
where you guys comment on cases you are recused from, too,'' the
documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Brock said Thayer made a similar comment to him Feb. 15.

<HEADLINE> Bush Fighting for Hispanic Voters  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- He's the Hispanic mayor of a Texas
Democratic stronghold, but Carlos Ramirez not only supports
Republican George W. Bush for president, he even traveled to New
Hampshire and California to campaign for him.
</P>
<P>
   He's just the kind of person Bush wants on his side.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Al Gore, too.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential candidates are vigorously courting local
leaders like Ramirez this year, as well as Hispanics in general.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's fastest-growing group of voters, Hispanics are
projected to account for 5.4 percent of the electorate this fall.
Even more important, four states with large Hispanic populations --
Texas, California, New York and Florida -- hold 144 of the 270
electoral votes needed to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The country's Hispanic vote has gone overwhelmingly to the
Democrats in the past two presidential elections. But Bush is
running about even with Gore in national polling, and the Texas
governor has said repeatedly he won't concede the Hispanic vote
this year.
</P>
<P>
   And neither will the GOP. The Republican National Committee
plans to spend $7 million to $10 million this year on a media
campaign reaching out to Hispanics, including an ad unveiled
Wednesday that is being tested in Fresno, Calif., which has a
sizable Latino population.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore, the Democratic vice president, use
Spanish-language ads in targeted areas and switch quickly to
Spanish when speaking to Hispanic crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has touted his 1998 Texas re-election as evidence of his
appeal. He captured as much as 49 percent of the Hispanic vote in
Texas that year, according to some exit polling, though other
polling put the figure lower.
</P>
<P>
   This year, one contest that might be instructive for the fall
was California's primary, which included voters of all parties.
</P>
<P>
   Gore won a majority of Hispanics. Bush got about one in five
Hispanic votes, poorer than his showing among non-Hispanics. John
McCain won nearly as many Hispanics as Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls found Bush winning Hispanics in equally overwhelming
majorities as non-Hispanics in Florida and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Hispanic vote, largely concentrated in New York
City, tends to be Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could be helped by the Elian Gonzalez controversy in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans there, unlike a majority of Hispanics elsewhere
in the country, tend to vote Republican. President Clinton and Gore
won the state in their 1996 re-election, but Gore's recent comments
on the Gonzalez case have not been well-received in the Miami area.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Texas, in an exit poll conducted in El Paso on
March 14, the day of the Texas presidential primary, 26 percent of
Hispanics said they voted for Bush, while 67.5 percent said they
voted for Gore, said Gregory Rocha, associate professor of
political science at the University of Texas at El Paso. The poll
had a margin of error of plus or minus 5.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that Mr. Bush can just assume that because he
did fairly well in the general election in '98 that this group is
sold on him,'' Rocha said.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   The two-term mayor of this border city, who identifies himself
as a ''conservative Democrat,'' says the Bush camp solicited his
help for the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramirez says, ''My support for him is because I have gotten
to know him as a person. I have gotten to know his values. I know I
can trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez is ''the kind of figure Mr. Bush can point to bolster
his claim of representing the broad center as a 'compassionate
conservative,''' said Bruce Buchanan, political scientist at the
University of Texas-Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has split from fellow Republicans in ways that could help
him with some Hispanics. While former California Gov. Pete Wilson
backed measures such as Proposition 187, which sought to end
government benefits for illegal immigrants, Bush advocated public
education for undocumented immigrant children. He supports
beefed-up border enforcement but believes in helping people already
here.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has made several trips to Mexico and supports the
North American Free Trade Agreement.

<HEADLINE> Group Labels 10 Parks 'Endangered'  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's national parks are facing a broad
range of threats from vandalism to air pollution and excessive
noise, a private park advocacy groups says after compiling a list
of the 10 federal parks it considers most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of our national parks are becoming a disgrace,''
complained Tom Kiernan, president of the National Park and
Conservation Association, which has some 400,000 members who
consider themselves watchdogs for the park system.
</P>
<P>
   The group said Wednesday it took five parks off last year's
list, but added five new parks consider among those most threatened
from such things as overcrowding, air pollution, vandalism, urban
sprawl and use of snowmobiles and Jet Skis.
</P>
<P>
   Making the list for a second year were three of the most popular
and well known national parks: Yellowstone, Great Smoky Mountains
and the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The parks that were replaced from last year included Gettysburg
National Monument in Pennsylvania where improvements were made in a
proposed visitors center; the Grand Canyon because steps are being
taken to ease congestion; and Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota
because of a moratorium on Jet Skis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the group said a gamut of threats jeopardize the park
system, which includes more than 360 separate units from the widely
known parks like Yellowstone to historic battlefields, national
monuments, seashores and historic sites.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone, the first park created in 1872 in northwestern
Wyoming, today ''ranks as one of the most endangered,'' said the
association. It is crowded even in winter with about 1,000
snowmobiles a day ''pumping tons of pollutants into the air,'' the
group said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the big concern at Yellowstone was its ''crumbling
sewage system.'' Previously a huge proposed gold mine near the park
put it on many environmentalists' endangered list, but plans for
the mine have been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The five new park sites on the list were:
</P>
<P>
   --Joshua Tree National Park in the California desert. A landfill
is being proposed 1{ miles from the park with 20,000 tons of
garbage expected to arrive daily.
</P>
<P>
   --Stones River National Battlefield in Tennessee. A highway is
being proposed to bisect the Civil War site which contains graves
of 7,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   --Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. It's been a target
of vandals and thieves. Visitors cart away 12 tons of fossilized
wood annually.
</P>
<P>
   --Ozark Scenic Riverways National Park in Missouri. Mining
companies are seeking permits to explore the watershed for deposits
of lead, raising concern about pollution of the scenic riverway.
</P>
<P>
   --National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. Only recently
created by Congress, the association says lawmakers are not
providing enough money to restore deteriorating structures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Yellowstone, the four other parks on the list for
the second year are:
</P>
<P>
   --Denali National Park in Alaska. Concern about noise and
pollution from a proposal for snowmobile access. Also, as last
year, concern about a proposed road and resort development.
</P>
<P>
   --Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee and North
Carolina. Polluted air from coal-burning power plants, some
hundreds of miles away, and pollution from a growing number of
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   --Everglades, Biscayne and Big Cypress in Florida. Development of
a proposed airport near the Everglades, off-road vehicle use in Big
Cypress, and a disruption of natural water flow.
</P>
<P>
   --Haleakala National Park in Hawaii. A proposed airport expansion
raises concern about an increase in alien species being brought
into the park, posing additional threats to native island plants
and other species.
</P>
<P>
   Also taken off the list from last year were the Chaco Culture
National Historic Park in New Mexico, after Congress provided more
money for preservation, and the Mojave National Preserve, because
of the closing of a mine long located there.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Victim Urges Gun Control  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patti Nielson figures that if anyone can
persuade Congress to pass a stalled gun control bill, it's a
teacher who was shot at Columbine High School last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nielson, who was grazed by a bullet fired by Eric Harris, a
student at the Littleton, Colo., school, came to Capitol Hill on
Wednesday to plead the case for the gun control measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe because I was shot at Columbine, maybe they'll
understand it's coming from my heart,'' Nielson said after a news
conference arranged by gun control advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Nielson wants Congress to pass the juvenile justice bill that
has been stalled for nine months. There is broad support for
certain provisions, such as child safety locks for handguns and
barring gun sales to people with juvenile criminal records. The
measure has been held up by debate over requiring background checks
for purchasers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Dylan Klebold, the Columbine students who killed a
dozen students and a teacher last April 20 before killing
themselves, used four guns bought at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here today because I'm wondering, 'Why hasn't Congress
done anything to prevent what happened at Columbine from happening
again?''' Nielson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nielson was on duty as a lunchroom monitor when she saw Harris,
who smiled and shot at her. Grazed in the shoulder, Nielson ran
into the school's library, called 911, and then hid as Harris and
Klebold entered the library and killed several students and
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I was in a safe place, and to know that there is no
safe place, it can happen anytime, anywhere -- that's frightening to
me,'' said Nielson, wiping away a tear.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans blame each other for the impasse over
the gun control measure. John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Democratic leaders refuse to consider
any ''common-sense compromise'' on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Feehery did not say what specific compromise Hastert favors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big holdup is that the Democratic leadership wants the
politics, not the policy,'' Feehery said. ''It's an election year,
and Democrats would rather run against a 'do-nothing Congress.'
They're being do-nothing Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat whose husband was
gunned down on a commuter train, said Democrats cannot accept a
watered-down version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Am I going to compromise to the point where I'm going to have
a victim come see me in three or four months and say, 'Why did you
compromise?' No, I cannot do that,'' said McCarthy, who organized
Nielson's news conference.

<HEADLINE> Meatpacker Target of Criminal Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The record keeping practices of a
Chicago-based meatpacker are the target of a criminal investigation
as the result of a government probe into allegations that a banned
carcinogen got into a beef shipment to Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged irregularities involving the Bruss Co., a subsidiary
of IBP Inc., turned up during the Agriculture Department's attempt
to track the beef that Swiss officials say contained the illegal
hormone known as DES, USDA officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we began looking into the DES issue some problems became
apparent that we are now investigating,'' Beth Gaston, a
spokeswoman for USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bookkeeping problems haven't changed the department's
conclusion that DES was never present in the beef, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of criminal wrongdoing will be turned over to the
Justice Department, she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a status report on the investigation, ''product
identification problems'' at Bruss prevented USDA from tracing meat
beyond ''several slaughter plants and numerous slaughter dates of
thousands of animals from hundreds of producers.
</P>
<P>
   An IBP spokesman did not immediately return phone calls seeking
comment late Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Aborigines: Our Generation Stolen  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN THORNHILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Fifty years ago, Barbara Sorby and
her six siblings were taken from their parents by welfare workers
and sent to live in orphanages, splitting their family forever.
</P>
<P>
   For Sorby, a member of the Kamilaroi Aboriginal tribe, the
emotional scars were torn open again this week when a Cabinet
minister denied the existence of the ''stolen generation'' of
Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 Aboriginal children were taken from their families
between 1910 and the 1970s in the belief that Aborigines were
doomed and saving the children was the only humane alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron, however, argued that it
is wrong to call them a stolen generation, a term most Australians
accept. Herron insisted that only about 10 percent of Aboriginal
children were taken from their families.
</P>
<P>
   ''A generation is all people born around that period,'' he said
in a weekend television interview. ''It didn't affect all
Aboriginal people and that's the point that I'm making.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment caused outrage among Aboriginal groups, and senior
indigenous representative Charles Perkins predicted that protests
by Aborigines would mar the Summer Olympics in Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally today by about 60 Aborigines outside Australia's
parliament, Sorby said Herron's comments left her feeling stripped
of dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Now 59, and with two daughters of her own, Sorby vividly
remembers the day that two women from a native welfare department
came to her family's riverside shack in central New South Wales
state to take her and her six brothers and sisters away from their
parents. Her youngest brother was just 15 months old at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lived in various girls' homes and some of them were quite
notorious,'' Sorby told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   She was never reunited with her parents, both of whom have since
died.
</P>
<P>
   ''What did I do wrong? I am still asking myself that today,''
she said, her voice cracking with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Sorby said the experience left her with deep psychological
problems, most notably difficulties establishing and maintaining
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   She said she finally found a kindred spirit in her husband, who
learned the trauma of separation when he was imprisoned in World
War II Nazi camps in his native Poland.
</P>
<P>
   After the demonstration, in an attempt to calm the storm
provoked by Herron's comments, Prime Minister John Howard publicly
apologized for the hurt they had caused.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me say very directly to anyone in the Australian community
who was in any way offended ... I am sorry about that,'' Howard
told parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Aborigines are a tiny minority of some 386,000 in
the country's mostly white population of 19 million. They generally
are the members of society who suffer the worst health, are the
poorest educated and are the most likely to be jailed.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Death-Row Inmates Seek Moratorium  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Darby Tillis got off death row when his fifth
trial on two murder charges finally yielded an acquittal. A DNA
test freed Ronald Jones from a death sentence for raping and
murdering a young mother. Gary Gauger escaped execution when an
appeals court overturned his conviction for slitting his parents'
throats.
</P>
<P>
   The three wrongfully convicted men are among 13 released from
Illinois' death row since 1987 -- more people than have been
executed by that state since the Supreme Court allowed the
reinstatement of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided record prompted the state's governor to call in
January for a moratorium on executions in Illinois until problems
with the system could be sorted out.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Tillis, Jones and Gauger came to Congress to seek
a nationwide halt to capital punishment until stronger safeguards
are in place to ensure innocent people aren't executed.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot bring a man back from the grave after you find
those errors,'' Tillis said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation sponsored by Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., would
immediately suspend all executions by the federal government and
the states for seven years. To get Justice Department permission to
resume executions, states would have to provide access to DNA
testing to everyone on death row who asks for it.
</P>
<P>
   Other pending measures in the House and Senate also seek
protections for capital defendants but do not call for a
moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Gov. George Ryan released a statement praising
Jackson's bill as a step toward ''ensuring that everyone accused of
a crime is treated fairly before the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there has not been a federal execution since 1963, the
number of people put to death by the states is increasing. There
are 3,600 people on death rows nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 87 have been freed since 1973, according to the
Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   Gauger was convicted in his parents' murders on their Illinois
farm in 1993. Police told him they had evidence linking him to the
crime and he made what he said was a hypothetical statement about
blacking out that was used as a confession. A state appeals court
overturned his conviction in 1996, and two gang members from
Wisconsin have since been charged with the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a homeless, alcoholic panhandler, confessed to and was
convicted for the 1985 killing of a mother of three. He later
recanted, saying he made up a story so police would stop beating
him. He was released from death row last year after DNA testing
proved he didn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Tillis and his co-defendant, Perry Cobb, were arrested for the
murder of two men during a 1977 robbery at a Chicago hot-dog stand.
Because of a lack of physical evidence and dubious witness
testimony, it took three trials to send them to death row.
</P>
<P>
   Their convictions eventually were overturned, another trial
ended in a hung jury, then a judge acquitted the men in 1987 --
after they spent more than nine years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''Death row is a horrible shock,'' said Tillis, now a minister
who formed a group to help former death-row inmates readjust to
society.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Porter, once two days from being executed, was released
from prison late last year. He had been on death row for 16 years
when several Northwestern University journalism classmates helped
prove another man committed the double murder for which he was
convicted. One of those students, Shawn Armburst, said today's
scattershot approach to fixing mistakes must be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not how the system is supposed to work,'' Armburst
said. ''Twenty-one-year-olds are not supposed to be responsible for
finding the innocent people on death row.''

<HEADLINE> TV Ad Roach Frightens Viewers  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Orkin company is really bugging folks.
</P>
<P>
   Television ads for the pest-control firm that feature a
realistic-looking cockroach scurrying across the screen have left
some viewers laughing, others upset and a few broken TVs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently, when you're sitting in your darkened den it seems
pretty real,'' said Michael Lollis, executive creative director at
the Atlanta office of J. Walter Thompson, which created the ads.
</P>
<P>
   A woman from Greensboro, Md., said she woke up two neighbors
late at night to come to her house to hunt and kill the roach until
one of the visitors figured out the bug was from the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt really stupid for getting my neighbors out of bed in
the middle of the night,'' she wrote to Orkin Pest Control. ''You
really got me!''
</P>
<P>
   An irate Tampa, Fla., woman who tried to kill the roach by
tossing a motorcycle helmet at it and instead broke her TV set
demanded that Atlanta-based Orkin buy her a new one. Another man
said his set was damaged after he threw a shoe at it.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, the Orkin Man doesn't do TV repair.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, titled ''Fake Out,'' began airing, mostly at night, on
March 1 in 90 percent of the country. They begin by appearing to be
an ad for a fictional fabric softener -- until the roach appears.
</P>
<P>
   Orkin and the ad agency say they have received dozens of calls
from people who reported being frightened, amused or both by the
ad. The company has even been prompted to launch an ''Orkin Got
Me'' contest.
</P>
<P>
   Lollis said the spot required ''lots of little technical
tricks.'' The creators added a slight glow around the edge of the
bug so it would appear to be sitting on the screen.

<HEADLINE> Judge: EPA Can Set Runoff Limits  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In the first ruling of its kind, a federal
judge has upheld the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to
set limits on water pollution caused by runoffs from farms and
logging.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup allows federal
regulators to combat such pollution by pressuring states to change
land-use practices. Federal officials, including EPA Administrator
Carol Browner, said they hope the ruling starts a national trend.
</P>
<P>
   ''This important decision allows us to build on our successes of
completing the task of cleaning our nation's waters,'' Browner said
Wednesday after the ruling was released.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling concerns provisions of the 1972 Clean Water Act that
the EPA did not start to enforce until 1991 under pressure from
courts and environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions allow the agency to tell states to come up with
ways to reduce pollution in rivers and waterways contaminated
solely by runoff, as opposed to industrial waste or sewage. The EPA
says runoff has become the leading threat to water quality in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The agency was sued by two California landowners, the American
Farm Bureau Federation and state and local farm organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The landowners, Guido and Betty Pronsolino, own forest property
along the Garcia River, one of 17 rivers on California's North
Coast classified as ''substandard'' by the EPA in 1992. The agency
said the river's coho salmon and steelhead populations have been
severely damaged by sediment from many years of logging.
</P>
<P>
   When the Pronsolinos sought a logging permit, state forestry
officials required various measures to reduce erosion -- as mandated
by the EPA -- including leaving certain trees uncut. The couple said
the measures would cost them $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   The landowners argued that nothing in the Clean Water Act
authorized the EPA to set pollution limits for waterways
contaminated solely by runoff. Their lawsuit argued that the EPA
had the right to regulate only pollutants discharged from ''point
sources,'' like drain pipes from sewage systems and industrial
plants -- and not runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Alsup disagreed, saying the Clean Water Act did not distinguish
between sources of pollution in requiring quality standards for all
waterways.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clean Water Act called for a comprehensive set of
water-quality standards for every navigable river and water in
America,'' the judge wrote. ''No substandard river or water was
immune by reason of its sources of pollution.''

<HEADLINE> Lee stepping down as public safety commissioner and head of crimelab  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- State Public Safety Commissioner Henry
Lee says he plans to retire July 1 in order to spend more time
investigating unsolved murders as a forensic scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also plans to step down as head of the state crime lab, a
position he has held for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to slow down the pace and work on cold cases, teaching
and training,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is a world-renowned forensics' expert who has testified in
the trials of O.J. Simpson and William Kennedy Smith. He is
currently working on other high-profile cases including the
investigation into the slaying of child beauty queen JonBenet
Ramsey in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Lee took over as commissioner in May 1998, replacing Waterbury
State's Attorney John Connelly, who wanted to return to the
courtroom. Lee was the fourth commissioner appointed by Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   Lee originally told the governor he would do the job for a year,
but relented and stayed another year. He said it was important to
finish some outstanding projects such as completing the installment
of the new radio system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have finished the projects I promised the governor I would
get done and now it is time to step back,'' Lee said. He said he
plans to meet with the governor to discuss his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Former Hartford Superior Court Judge Arthur Spada is among those
being considered for the post, said Dean Pagani, Rowland's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Spada is best known for conducting the grand jury into Hartford
police corruption in the mid-1990s. A total of eight officers were
indicted; two have been acquitted at trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm honored that the governor includes me as one of the people
on his list of candidates,'' Spada said.
</P>
<P>
   Pagani would not discuss other candidates or whether Rowland is
intent on naming someone from outside the state police agency as
the new commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you can see a trend with the last two commissioners of
the governor looking outside the agency,'' Pagani said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Struggles Against Stereotype  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   IGAMBIRO, Uganda (AP) -- Images etched in memory run together, of
a nation seemingly adrift and wracked by violence.
</P>
<P>
   Idi Amin's bloody reign of terror blurs into the onslaught of
AIDS, of Western tourists hacked to death by teen-age fighters and
now, of more than 900 cult members who helped forge their own
doomsday in compounds spread across luxuriant green hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   To much of the West, Uganda is a mysterious country of
unparalleled brutality, a place of endless tragedy still living
under the specter of a monstrous dictator.
</P>
<P>
   But that, they'll tell you in Uganda, is a myth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am proud of my country,'' said Nathan Bangirana, a math
teacher at the Igambiro Primary School, standing beside the simple
brick building on an overcast afternoon as students prepared to
head back to homes set amid the rolling hills of southwestern
Uganda. ''The economy is now stabilized, the security situation is
under control, there is money for education.''
</P>
<P>
   This Central African nation has blossomed over the past decade,
with a stable government, a vibrant free-market economy and an
all-out assault to slow the spread of AIDS. Increasing numbers of
tourists are visiting the volcanic lakes, rolling plains, and
mountains that are home to some of the world's last remaining
mountain gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   Idi Amin Dada, the brutal dictator who remains synonymous with
Uganda to many people, is long gone, living in exile in Saudi
Arabia. Since 1986, President Yoweri Museveni has run the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Ugandans think that the Americans and the Europeans,
whenever there is a calamity ... that is what they know about
Uganda. They feel that Americans think Ugandans are living in
trees, they are barbaric,'' said Mwambutsya Ndebesa, head of the
history department at Makerere University in Kampala. ''And they
have a wrong image.''
</P>
<P>
   Uganda, to be sure, has its share of problems. Parts of the
country face regular attacks by brutal rebel groups and AIDS
remains a vicious scourge, with millions infected with HIV. Poverty
is widespread in parts of the country of 21 million.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, in an attack that made newspaper headlines
around the world and crippled Uganda's tourism industry for months,
eight Westerners were murdered during a trip to see the gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten
Commandments of God that fills the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   More than 900 members of the cult, which preached doomsday
theology to more than 1,000 followers throughout Uganda's
southwest, have been found stuffed into mass graves or burned alive
in recent weeks. Authorities believe they were murdered by their
leaders after the world did not come to an end -- as predicted -- on
Dec. 31, and many members began turning against them.
</P>
<P>
   But in a region beset by civil wars, famines and crippling
official corruption, Uganda in fact is the bright spot, a place
where stability is more rule than exception, where jobs can be
found and where personal freedoms are guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is far different elsewhere in this part of Africa:
Neighboring Congo barely functions, neighboring Sudan has seen
decades of war, neighboring Rwanda is now remembering hundreds of
thousands of people killed in its 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
   And for all its high-profile traumas, Uganda has left behind the
days when it was a nightmare state.
</P>
<P>
   Stop into nearly any Ugandan town or village and the stories of
the dark days -- when Amin and his even more brutal successor,
Milton Obote, laid waste to Uganda -- come pouring out. Well over
500,000 people are believed to have died during their regimes, many
at the hands of government security forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''So many people were being taken away, we don't even know how
many,'' said Norah Mutebi, the head teacher at the Igambiro school.
''Still now, we don't know where they were taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Bangirana, the math teacher, remembers when arrests were
rampant, when lack of funding closed some schools for years and
when intertribal violence was near constant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, things are different.
</P>
<P>
   ''People get along here,'' he said, looking at the students, who
come from across Uganda. ''We have people of all tribes here now.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And we're proud of that.''

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- Six months after the army toppled his government,
Nawaz Sharif was sentenced Thursday to life in prison on charges that he refused
to let a passenger plane land in Pakistan, endangering all 198 people on board.
Judge Rehmetullah Jaffri found Sharif guilty of hijacking and terrorism. He was
acquitted of attempted murder and kidnapping. The other six men, including his
brother, who were charged along with Sharif were acquitted of all the charges.
Sharif is expected to appeal.

Elian's Dad Set To Come to U.S.

	   HAVANA (AP) -- Declaring victory in the battle over 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez, President Fidel Castro predicted it would only be a matter of days
before the boy is embraced by his father. Juan Miguel Gonzalez planned to fly
Thursday to the United States to reclaim his son. "The battle of Elian has been
won -- in judicial terms, in legal terms, in political terms," Castro told
hundreds of students from across Latin America and the Caribbean who were
attending a regional congress. Elian's father, stepmother and 6-month-old half
brother were to leave Havana in a private plane early Thursday and arrive in
Washington accompanied by Fernando Remirez, chief of the Cuban Interests Section
in Washington, who offered the family his home during their U.S. stay.

Gas Tax Rollback Faces Uphill Climb
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's election-year
proposal to roll back federal gasoline taxes because of soaring pump prices is
facing an increasingly uphill climb. As it continued debate today on a $1.83
trillion budget for next year, the Senate was likely to easily approve a
bipartisan amendment opposing Lott's plan. The Mississippi Republican has
proposed erasing the 4.3 cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase enacted in 1993,
and suspending the entire 18.4 cent-a-gallon tax if the average pump price of a
gallon of regular unleaded tops $2 this year. Cutbacks in OPEC oil production
led to big spike in gasoline and home heating oil prices over the past year.

went into a coma. Clinton placed the call soon after flying from Washington to

<HEADLINE> Albright Deplores Fight Over Elian  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke
with sadness about the plight of Elian Gonzalez, and there was
obvious disappointment when she talked about the might-have-beens
in U.S.-Cuban relations.
</P>
<P>
   Albright knows something about both topics, being the
grandmother of a boy who, like Elian, is 6, and having spent a good
part of her life studying ways of changing communist regimes.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday with Associated Press editors and
reporters, Albright said she was perplexed that the Elian case
remained unresolved after more than four months. ''It's a terrible,
terrible issue,'' she said. ''It's the question of a child needing
to be with its natural parent and the desire for that child to have
a good life. It's very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the interview came word that Elian's father, who
had received his U.S. visa on Tuesday, was coming to the United
States today, raising the possibility he would take temporary
custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been living with his great-uncle in Miami since being
rescued off the coast of Florida in November.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also disclosed in the interview that the administration
years ago had thought about developing a new approach to Cuba with
a view toward promoting change.
</P>
<P>
   As a native of Eastern Europe who watched communist regimes
there become demoralized and eventually collapse, Albright
suggested the prospect of change in Cuba intrigued her and others
in the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Castro himself has, not surprisingly, brushed aside the notion
that Cuba needs a transition. ''We had our transition in 1959,'' he
has said, referring to the year he took power.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright, recalling President Clinton's early years in
office, said, ''There was a desire among all of us to see whether
something could be different about the relationship with Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   What put change out of reach, she said, was the Cuban decision
to use MiG fighters to shoot down two unarmed, Miami-based private
planes over international waters north of Cuba in 1996. Three U.S.
citizens of Cuban origin were killed. A fourth who died was a
Cuban-American permanent resident of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   That incident, Albright said, ''made it very difficult to pursue
change.''
</P>
<P>
   The degree to which U.S.-Cuban relations has sunk is symbolized
by an ''anti-imperialist'' monument which was inaugurated this week
in Havana near the U.S. diplomatic mission.
</P>
<P>
   ''It strikes me that the cost of that monument, the money, might
have been better spent on helping the poor people of Cuba,''
Albright said. ''The question I always have about any of these
dictators is are they really interested in their people.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright believes the 1996 attack was a calculated attempt by
Castro to undercut U.S. policy, enshrined at the time in the Cuba
Democracy Act of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The law tightened the embargo on the one hand while opening the
way for donations of food and medicine to Cuba as well as
people-to-people exchanges. Albright said Castro was angry because
the U.S. policy was working. He complained particularly about the
exchanges, calling them subversive.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging over more than a dozen foreign policy issues -- and
saying it is far too soon for her to consider what she might do
when her term as secretary of state ends in January -- Albright also
said:
</P>
<P>
   --American officials are sounding out Russian President Vladimir
Putin about holding a summit meeting with Clinton. Saying they have
much to talk about, Albright called Putin ''a pragmatic man who has
to get through a large agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   --She will keep insisting that any U.S. dialogue with Iran
include U.S. allegations that Iran sponsors terrorism and seeks to
acquire weapons of mass destruction. Earlier Wednesday, Iran's
foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, said in Tehran that her
groundbreaking proposal last month to reverse more than two decades
of distrust was welcome and had some positive points.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said the overture was marred by continuing U.S.
hostility. He called for ''practical steps'' to show the policy has
been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   --The United States, in easing sanctions against Iraq so it could
sell more oil and import more food, was mindful of Arab concerns
that the Iraqi people were being victimized by the U.S.-organized
boycott.
</P>
<P>
   -- The United States was preparing to help Israel find an
''internationally legitimized way'' of withdrawing its troops from
southern Lebanon in July. The administration prefers a pullout be
part of an overall accord between Israel and Syria, but
negotiations were shelved indefinitely in mid-January, and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak seems to determined to withdraw
unilaterally this summer.

<HEADLINE> Privacy May Affect Census Response  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Census Bureau is getting back long forms
at a slower rate than the less-detailed short forms, prompting the
agency's director to worry that claims by critics that census
questions are too intrusive could hamper the collection of
essential demographic information.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, 60 percent of the short forms, which went to 100
million households, were returned, compared with 48 percent of the
20 million long forms sent out, Kenneth Prewitt told the House
Government Reform census subcommittee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 percentage point difference is twice that of the response
rates between the two forms at a similar point in the 1990 census,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pledged ... that I would bring to your attention any
development which could be the census at risk. Nothing in our
current operations poses such a risk, but the widespread attack on
the long form could have serious consequences,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional Republicans last week reported hearing from
constituents who complained that census questions were too
intrusive. Aides to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
said they suggested that worried callers send back partially
completed forms because ''it was better than throwing it in the
trash.''
</P>
<P>
   The short form is eight questions long and takes roughly 10
minutes to fill out. The long form has 53 questions that ask for
more detailed information. It takes about 35 minutes to complete,
census officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have questioned why people are asked on the long
form, for example, about their home's plumbing. That information,
Census Bureau officials say, is used in part to determine areas in
danger of ground water contamination.
</P>
<P>
   A question found on both forms that some consider intrusive asks
for a person's race. Responses are used as a basis for federal
voting rights and civil rights regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Long forms usually come back more slowly than short forms
because it takes more time to complete, and people tend to put it
off, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, concerns over privacy could lead to lower-than-expected
long-form response rates, he said. And that may cause the Census
Bureau to hire more workers to send out and gather information from
households that did not send in a form. Those workers would have to
spend more time visiting homes since there is more information to
compile.
</P>
<P>
   But the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Dan Miller, said the
public's increased concern over privacy in general has grown over
the past decade. Prewitt agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the first day that the forms were being received at
millions of homes around the nation, members of Congress were
receiving phone calls from constituents who were very upset about
the long form,'' said Miller, R-Fla., adding he urged people to
complete the form.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, 57 percent of all forms had been returned to
the Census Bureau. Prewitt is cautiously optimistic that by
mid-April, the agency will get at least 61 percent, and he hopes
for as much as 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said Republican criticism was
''outrageous, irresponsible demagoguery.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They threaten the success of the census by driving the
response rate down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller pointed out that many congressional members from both
parties have promoted this year's count. He even played a public
service announcement featuring Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a mistake or callous political move to lay the
blame for this controversy at the feet of the Republicans,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Latest Space Crew Docks With Mir  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Two Russian cosmonauts linked up with the Mir
space station today in a mission to bring the aging craft back to
life after it circled Earth unoccupied for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Zalyotin and Alexander Kaleri, who lifted off from the
Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakstan on Tuesday, docked flawlessly with
the space station on autopilot, officials at Mission Control said.
</P>
<P>
   The ground crew, packed in the mission control room, burst into
applause as the cosmonauts' space capsule connected with Mir,
relieved that there were no problems docking with the unmanned
station.
</P>
<P>
   The last crew to man the space station returned to Earth in
August when the cash-strapped Russian space program decided to get
rid of the 14-year-old orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   But space officials put off the station's destruction date
indefinitely after MirCorp, based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, agreed
to pay $10 million to $20 million to lease commercial rights to the
station.
</P>
<P>
   MirCorp has said it is considering various ventures aboard Mir,
including opening it up for well-heeled tourists. Under the
agreement, Mir remains Russian-owned and available for Russian
scientific use.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials continue to insist that Mir is good for
several more years in orbit, even though it has been plagued by
accidents and breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The most terrifying were a fire and a near-fatal crash in 1997
when an unmanned supply ship docking with the station strayed off
course. The ship punctured one of the station's modules, which had
to be sealed off for good.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the station, Zalyotin and Kaleri will concentrate on
plugging a small air leak that developed this summer. Shortly
before the last crew left, officials noticed that the station was
slowly losing oxygen, but said patching it could wait.
</P>
<P>
   The two were also expected to go on a spacewalk to conduct
several scientific experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The mission had been originally set to last for 45 days, but
officials extended it to 60 days after cutting Russian actor
Vladimir Steklov from the crew. His flight was scrapped after
filmmakers failed to pay the multimillion-dollar tab.

<HEADLINE> Woods Eyes 2nd Green Jacket  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Sam Snead will hit an honorary drive off the
first tee at Augusta National, hoping to avoid the rough that
didn't exist when he won the first of three Masters titles 51 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the rest of the field follows today for real, they'll find
a course that is slicker, hairier, longer and more full of trees
than anyone could have imagined more than a half century before.
</P>
<P>
   It will also contain one Tiger, of course, and that might be the
biggest difference by itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to be a hard guy to beat,'' Greg Norman said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods is the most dominant favorite for the Masters since
Jack Nicklaus was in his prime, bringing a game to Augusta National
this spring that is far more refined than the one he used to rout
the field three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He's won 10 times since finishing nine shots behind Jose Maria
Olazabal here last year. Woods has finished either first or second
10 times in his last 11 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Even the latest changes to the course seem to favor his kind of
game, as if Woods needs any help.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's helping anybody who can hit the ball long and high,''
said Woods, who does just that.
</P>
<P>
   A year after first introducing a light cut of rough, Augusta
National's grass looks like it is on steroids, spreading out into
fairways that in the past were carefully coiffed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from 1949 when the greens were a bumpy bermuda
and the big news was the construction of Ike's Pond so Dwight
Eisenhower could have a place to fish.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen more changes this year than I have in a long time,''
said Tom Watson, who has won twice here in 26 appearances. ''Some
people call them subtle changes, but I've seen a lot of change.''
</P>
<P>
   The rough is meant to test accuracy and protect par, and indeed
players are predicting higher scores this week. But Jose Maria
Olazabal won last year at only 8-under-par, and he and others would
just as soon see Augusta National left alone for once.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a true piece of art, this golf course,''
Olazabal said. ''You know, when you have a great painting or
whatever, you don't try to change much on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods would be a prohibitive favorite even if all the trees were
bulldozed from Augusta National. It was his 18-under-par rout in
1997 that set the most recent changes in motion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see the need to always have to change it every year,''
Woods said. ''I guess that's something they like to do around this
place. I don't know. Maybe they get bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Boredom wasn't the issue, insisted Masters chairman Hootie
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those young men hit the golf ball a long ways and we felt we
could no longer let them swing from the heels,'' Johnson said. ''We
had to require more accuracy off the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Hal Sutton, who hasn't been able to find a way
to play well at Augusta in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes you do things you don't normally do,'' Sutton said.
''You have to hit a high, long ball here. It makes you want to try
to alter your game to fit the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton comes into the Masters with a bit of a reputation as a
Tiger killer, after beating Woods head-to-head in the Player's
Championship two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the rest of the field some hope, something David Duval
insisted he did not need.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came in last year expecting to win the golf tournament and I
came in this year expecting to win the golf tournament,'' Duval
said.
</P>
<P>
   Winning is something Duval hasn't done since his streak of four
titles in eight tournaments leading into last year's Masters. He
was the world's top-ranked player at the time, a title he soon lost
as Woods went on his winning binge.
</P>
<P>
   The course changes don't bother Duval as much as the fact he
hasn't yet won a major at the age of 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can talk about the changes all you want but, you know,
that's not for me to decide,'' Duval said. ''They didn't call me up
after last year's event and ask me what I thought about the
changes, so I'm not worried about it.''

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Merle Den Bleyker's pager went off
hundreds of times during the months he spent recuperating from a
stem-cell transplant to fight cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But the buzzings were a blessing, not an annoyance. Den
Bleyker's friends used the pager to let him know they were praying
for him around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really was an instrument in God's hands,'' says Den
Bleyker, 52, who today is back at his job as a missionary director.
''It was simply a message ... that someone cared, that someone was
praying for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, groups are turning to pagers to provide
24-hour support to those they believe are in need of prayer. It's
the latest example of the ways technology and spirituality come
together, says Brenda Brasher, a religion professor at Mount Union
College in Alliance, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   People already use e-mail and Internet chat rooms to pray
together, but pagers offer an added benefit. In a society where
people frequently live far away from family, a pager's beep or buzz
can be a comforting reminder that a person is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We live far apart from each other, so when you're ill, to some
extent you're facing it alone,'' Brasher says. ''With a pager,
there is this concrete evidence that people are praying for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Pure Heart of Mary Church in Topeka, Kan., set up a prayer
pager program after a member read about a similar Texas effort.
Since then, the church has distributed more than 40 pagers to
ailing parishioners and set up a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of those people are very ill -- they can't necessarily get
up to answer a telephone,'' says Kathy Welch, who helps coordinate
the program and herself calls more than three dozen pagers a day
after praying.
</P>
<P>
   ''This way they don't have to return any phone calls, and they
know they are being prayed for,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Youth Specialties, a business dedicated to Christian education,
suggests that youth pastors give their pagers to young congregants
to call when they need a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be, 'Hey, I need to pass this test,' or something
more serious,'' says Rene Howe, a manager with the El Cajon,
Calif., company.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, high school students as well as the ailing carry
pagers as part of Third Christian Reformed Church's ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've partnered every student with an adult leader. ... These
kids get paged by their prayer leaders,'' says Pastor Dave de
Ridder, who came up with the idea four years ago as a way to let an
ill friend in another state know she was in his prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Some efforts are initiated by friends or worshippers just
looking for a way to stay in touch. Others are started by youth
ministries, church bulletins, Web sites or word-of-mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The pagers also are used differently. In some cases, worshippers
punch in a number code that stands for a specific message. Den
Bleyker's pager, for example, used the numbers ''77,'' which
corresponds to ''PP'' on a phone dial and stands for the ''peace
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Under other programs, people dial in a prearranged phone number
connected to voice mail, where they've left a message of support.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Mies of Topeka says her 87-year-old mother received a
prayer pager from the Most Pure Heart of Mary Church during the
last months of her life. Again and again, the pager's display would
flash ''888'' -- the code the church chose to represent the words
''Our Lord Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she was surprised that people would be praying for
her, people whom she didn't even know,'' recalls Mies. ''It was
very emotional to know that people were praying ... not only for my
mom, but for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   She also liked the fact that, as other church members gave the
prayer pager numbers to their friends or people read about the
pagers online, her mother was paged by worshippers from all faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very ecumenical. A prayer is a prayer, I don't care who
does it,'' she says. ''Prayer is one of the most unifying things
for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   De Ridder, the Denver pastor, uses the church bulletin to share
prayer pager numbers with the 700 members of his congregation. A
few have been returned by people who were uncomfortable with the
constant buzzing, he said, but most people like them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, family members of those who carried pagers and died
make donations to the program in their honor. ''The widow or
widower will say that was very valuable, please keep this going,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Den Bleyker's ''77'' pages came at all hours during his
treatment for non-Hodgkins lymphoma at a hospital in Ann Arbor,
about 120 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The constant buzzing took a little getting used to, admits Den
Bleyker, who had never used a pager before and carried it on his
belt or placed on the nightstand next to his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was one time when I thought, 'Why can't they let me
sleep?''' he recalls, chuckling. ''But then I realized what it was
about and I thought, 'That's really super.'''

<HEADLINE> Eifman Uses Ballet for Human Drama  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''The Red Giselle'' bursts like skyrockets
across the stage, delivering a highly charged drama enacted by the
superb dancers of the Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The steps are classical ballet, used in modern combinations.
Unlike George Balanchine's neoclassical plotless ballets, which
emphasized interesting movement, the intent of choreographer Boris
Eifman is drama. It reminds a viewer of choreographer Maurice
Bejart but has more substance and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Red Giselle'' was performed for the first of seven times
on Wednesday at the City Center. After a three-week season ends
here April 16, the company will dance in Boston, Minneapolis,
Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, Denver and Colorado
Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet is based on the life of Russian ballerina Olga
Spessivtseva, considered the greatest romantic ballerina of her
generation. Born in 1895, she left Russia at age 28, danced in the
Paris Opera Ballet from 1924 to 1932, suffered depression, moved to
the United States, spent 20 years in a mental hospital and ended
her life living with Russians on a New York farm maintained by
writer Leo Tolstoy's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Red Giselle'' begins in a ballet class, with a stern
teacher, danced by Sergei Basalaev, singling out Spessivtseva,
danced by Yelena Kuzmina. The ballerina attracts a secret police
agent, danced by Albert Galichanin, who meets her backstage.
</P>
<P>
   They have a fascinating pas de deux in which he dominates by
force and near cruelty. He grasps her arm instead of her hand and
turns, pulls and lifts her, sometimes over his head. She looks
helpless, often limply falls forward. But when he lets go of her,
she reaches out to him. He puts his coat around her, baring his
muscled arms, and carries her out.
</P>
<P>
   She dances in front of a ragamuffin mob; the teacher is
symbolically tortured. Kuzmina and Galichanin have another duet,
obviously a love duet, but when he swirls her around it's
deliberately not pretty and full of anguish on both sides. Finally
he lets her go and she runs out and climbs a gangplank, leaving
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In Act 2, in Paris, she falls in love with a dancer (portrayed
by Igor Markov), but he has a male lover. Act 2 has an abbreviated
Act 1 of the famous ballet ''Giselle,'' along with a lively
balletic Charleston scene in a Paris nightclub, featuring women in
chic flapper dresses. The ballerina sees visions there of her
former lover. She has begun to go mad, put in a straitjacket and
imprisoned in a transparent dome.
</P>
<P>
   She is then released to dance some of ''Giselle'' Act 2. The
ending is quietly sad; when the ballerina bows, her surroundings
suggest a room in a mental hospital -- typical of the ingenious
staging that helps make this production a triumph.

<HEADLINE> 'Fail Safe' Heads for Live TV  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It was a spooky time, the Cold War, cartoonish
now in the purity with which it kept Americans on edge: Here we
were, the heroes, up against those devilish Commies and Nikita
Khrushchev, a demonic fatso vowing to bury us.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both sides had the Bomb, which made modern life a
nervous proposition. In the United States, at least, who passed a
day without a stray thought summoning up the mushroom cloud?
</P>
<P>
   Walter Bernstein remembers those days well. He has a fitting
trophy from that era: the screenplay he wrote for the 1964 feature
''Fail Safe.'' And now he has written the script for its TV
revival.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Harvey Wheeler-Eugene Burdick novel of the same
name, ''Fail Safe'' dramatizes the chilling outcome after a U.S.
bomber is erroneously dispatched to drop a nuclear warhead on
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   As the title indicates, this is a screwup that simply couldn't
happen. But does. No wonder the film -- stark, gripping and tragic --
gave everyone the willies. Including George Clooney who, though in
diapers back in 1964, claims to have watched it more than a hundred
times since then.
</P>
<P>
   Now 38, the ''ER''-hunk-turned-movie-idol has used his clout to
bring ''Fail Safe'' to live TV. The two-hour, black-and-white
performance airs on CBS Sunday at 9 p.m. EDT, tape-delayed for the
West Coast. (Then, for viewers who just can't get enough, cable's
Turner Classic Movies will run the original film at 2:30 a.m. EDT;
11:30 p.m. PDT.)
</P>
<P>
   Clooney's new production, directed by Stephen Frears, features
Brian Dennehy, Harvey Keitel, Noah Wyle, Don Cheadle, Clooney
himself and, in the Henry Fonda role as the hapless president,
Richard Dreyfuss.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney enlisted Walter Bernstein to write the script.
</P>
<P>
   For his ''Fail Safe'' encore, Bernstein, now an uncompromising
80 years old, set out to recapture the Cold War era and the film's
fearsome thrust. And, no, he hasn't crafted a jolly new ending.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was happy that they weren't looking to update the story or
tart it up in any way,'' says Bernstein, in an interview in his
apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, the ''Fail Safe'' remake seems driven by
old-fashioned respect for its precursor, and for the tradition of
live TV drama. The biggest difference between the movie-show ''Fail
Safe'' and this Sunday's telecast may not be the productions
themselves, but their respective audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Four decades after the film's release, the ''Red Scare'' seems
an oddly quaint menace -- a bygone cultural signifier like fallout
shelters and ''duck and cover'' drills. In this post-Cold War age,
the Bomb (always reverently capitalized) seems so yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But if ''Fail Safe'' today bears the trappings of a period
piece, in 1964 it represented a state-of-the-art nightmare. And it
played to the converted, as did its 1963 satirical counterpart,
''Dr. Strangelove'' (subtitle ''How I Learned to Stop Worrying and
Love the Bomb'').
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people aren't worried today,'' Bernstein says glumly.
''But they should be.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel that the subject matter of 'Fail Safe' is more relevant
today than it was when we did the film. Then, there were just two
superpowers with the Bomb -- Russia and America. Now everybody's got
it. So the chances of an accident, which is what the story is based
on, are even greater than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing the teleplay let Bernstein take another whack at a
project he had tackled half a lifetime ago. It also meant an
unlikely homecoming to the all-but-vanished realm of live TV.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-videotape 1950s, live drama was Bernstein's
bailiwick. He stayed busy writing for such New York-based
anthologies as ''Danger'' and ''You Are There'' -- even when a
lapsed membership in the Communist Party led to his blacklisting.
</P>
<P>
   During the anti-Communist hysteria of the McCarthy Era,
Bernstein was forced to sell his scripts through subterfuge. He had
to find someone politically unbesmirched to assume artistic credit
and serve as Bernstein's secret surrogate. This masquerade would
inspire his 1976 comedy, ''The Front,'' which starred Woody Allen
as a schnook who takes a little too seriously his phony status as a
writer.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Bernstein has had his hands full with TV work,
often writing for HBO, including the script for its Emmy-winning
1997 movie ''Miss Ever's Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he professes surprise that anyone remembered him for
''Fail Safe'' Redux, to which he is the lone returnee from the
film. ''I'm kind of bemused by the whole thing,'' he allows.
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday's telecast, Bernstein plans to be at ground zero
(Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, Calif.) where, as likely as not,
he'll still be bemused.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't learned much since the movie was released,'' he
muses, thinking of our threatened world. And yet -- go figure -- it's
still in one piece.

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Ten-year-old Cody Gifford, made a
household name by his television host mother Kathie Lee Gifford,
sued a tabloid Thursday over an article claiming he is
incorrigible.
</P>
<P>
   The libel lawsuit filed in Palm Beach County claims The Examiner
tabloid fabricated stories that Cody misbehaved on the set of the
ABC movie ''Janine &AMP; Alex: Cover Girls,'' in which he had role.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a gratuitous, nasty article about a ... child and they
think they ought to take some action,'' Los Angeles lawyer Barry
Langberg said about the Feb. 8 article with the headline, ''Kathie
Lee's Turning Poor Cody into a Monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the tabloid said they had not seen the lawsuit and
wouldn't comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Gifford announced plans to step down as co-host of
''Live with Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee.'' At the time she said she was no
longer comfortable with sharing details of her family life on the
air ''only to watch the tabloid media turn them into harmful,
misleading and libelous stories.''

<HEADLINE> AP Reviews ''House Arrest''  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA, AP Drama Critic
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Not many actresses would have the audacity to
portray Thomas Jefferson AND George Stephanopoulos AND Walt Whitman
AND Gloria Steinem -- all in one play.
</P>
<P>
   But in ''House Arrest,'' author and solo performer Anna Deavere
Smith doesn't shirk from trying on more than one hat, even when
several are less than perfect fits.
</P>
<P>
   ''House Arrest,'' Smith's latest epic endeavor, has been
subtitled ''A Search for American Character In and Around the White
House,'' and her one-woman expedition, now on view at
off-Broadway's Public Theater, is exhausting. Exhausting, yet often
fascinating in its attempt to make sense out of what the presidency
does to the people in and around it.
</P>
<P>
   The play, culled from hundreds of interviews, is not as focused
as Smith's previous works, ''Fires in the Mirror'' -- dealing with
the tense relationship between blacks and Jews in Brooklyn's Crown
Heights -- or ''Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992,'' which examined the
rioting after the police beating of Rodney King.
</P>
<P>
   In ''House Arrest,'' Smith wanders through more than 200 years
of American history, although she concentrates on the present,
particularly the Clinton years and Monica Lewinsky. The woman is a
sharp interviewer and a thorough scholar, maybe too enamored of her
own research.
</P>
<P>
   Smith makes some intriguing comparisons between how the press
dealt with the presidency in the past -- not publicly acknowledging
the private foibles of chief executives -- and how today it delves
into every personal detail: Not only the present president, but
those of long ago, judging from the play's extended fascination
with Jefferson and his affair with Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   Race threads its way through ''House Arrest,'' with the
consequences of slavery echoing into the present day.
Assassinations, from Lincoln to Kennedy, also make their mark. Ann
Richards, former governor of Texas, chillingly describes events in
Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, and how she learned about the Kennedy
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The author opens and closes the show with a lively impersonation
of Chicago author Studs Terkel. When asked to name the defining
moment in American history, the impish raconteur can't come up with
one.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he laments what he calls ''moral slippage,'' a term he
says came out of the Nixon White House. Terkel sees this decline as
emblematic of what is wrong with the country, and his interviewer
would seem to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's portrayal of Terkel is quirky, not exactly spot-on, but
it is enough of an approximation to work. Other impersonations are
less successful, particularly her Jefferson and a subdued, somber
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The physical production has been directed by Jo Bonney. It is
top-heavy with props, slides, costume changes and busy bits of
scenery, forever trundling on and off stage. But then, Smith's
effort is mammoth, more than a full evening of theater. A little
trimming would go a long way toward making this ''House Arrest'' a
more theatrical, fast-paced confinement.

<HEADLINE> Seinfeld's Wife Is Pregnant  </HEADLINE>
By JUDIE GLAVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Imagine Jerry Seinfeld inside his Long Island
mansion, baby bottle in one hand, burp cloth in the other, musing:
Whyyyyy do they call it a burp cloth?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. First came love (1998), then came marriage (last
December)-- and now Seinfeld and bride, Jessica Sklar, will soon be
pushing a baby carriage.
</P>
<P>
   The big announcement was made Thursday by Seinfeld pal Regis
Philbin on TV's ''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes. It's true. There will be a new little Seinfeld sometime
this fall,'' said Seinfeld's spokeswoman, Elizabeth Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first child for both Sklar and Seinfeld, who made
millions from a TV show that glorified single life and poked fun at
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then and this is now, and soon the 45-year-old
Seinfeld will be up to his diaper bag in commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld apparently asked Philbin to serve up the news for him.
Philbin did it gladly, informing viewers that the little Seinfeld
is scheduled to arrive in October. Clarke did not want to pinpoint
the due date.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrival may have the undevoted attention of his dad, who
retired his series in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Seinfeld will also have plenty of room for all that kid
stuff like swing sets, playhouses, bicycles and building blocks.
The couple are reportedly paying as much as $40 million for Billy
Joel's 12-acre oceanfront mansion in East Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other kids in the neighborhood for playdates.
Steven Spielberg has a place nearby and he has five children.

<HEADLINE> Survey: More Sickness in Cities  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- City dwellers get sick more often than their
rural counterparts. People who live in areas of high unemployment
are more likely to feel unhealthy. And people living in poverty are
sick most often.
</P>
<P>
   Those trends were drawn from a five-year study released Thursday
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The government asked adults how many days in the prior month
they were unhealthy and compiled results from 1993 through 1997.
Those numbers were compared to factors such as population, income
levels and unemployment rates.
</P>
<P>
   The study supports earlier research showing that residents in
some pockets of extremely high unemployment reported feeling
unhealthy up to 20 days a month.
</P>
<P>
   ''People that say they are unable to work have extremely high
levels of unhealthy days,'' said David Moriarty, spokesman for the
CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health
Promotion. ''We really don't know if people are not feeling well
because they are unemployed, or they're without a job because they
may not have resources to have health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   For the general population, the average number of unhealthy days
a month is 5.3.
</P>
<P>
   People living in counties with more than a million residents
were unhealthy almost 5.6 days a month, while those who live in
counties with between a half-million and a million people felt bad
5.1 days a month.
</P>
<P>
   However, people who lived in the least populous areas -- fewer
than 25,000 residents -- were almost as sick as their urban
counterparts, with 5.4 unhealthy days a month.
</P>
<P>
   Moriarty said the study is a first step to help local officials
identify problems that lead to high illness rates in their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Martin, public health manager for the Columbia-Boone County
Health Department in Columbia, Mo., agreed. ''You have to know
where you are to be able to know where you want to go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A detailed analysis of the CDC study results for 3,000 counties
will be released in July.

<HEADLINE> Does Houston Have a Problem?  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Does Houston -- Whitney Houston -- have a problem?
</P>
<P>
   There was that allegation of marijuana possession in January, a
much-discussed absence at last month's Oscars, and a disjointed
magazine interview.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the superstar singer is scheduled to perform at
Arista Records' 25th anniversary party. Given the tumult in her
personal life in recent months, her appearance will be heavily
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   ''WHERE WAS WHITNEY?'' asked the New York Post after the diva's
performance at the Academy Awards was canceled amid a report that
she was ''totally out of it'' during a rehearsal with Burt
Bacharach.
</P>
<P>
   The same question applied after Houston failed to appear at the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame dinner three weeks earlier. Houston was
scheduled to help induct Clive Davis, the music impresario who
signed her to Arista in the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whitney is in good spirits and looking forward to Monday's
event,'' says her publicist, Nancy Seltzer, who had earlier blamed
a sore throat for the Oscar incident and ''voice problems'' for the
Hall of Fame flameout.
</P>
<P>
   But the bad news continues. The upcoming People magazine
features a cover story about ''Whitney's Troubled Times.'' Citing
anonymous sources, it suggests a drug problem -- an allegation
Houston has denied in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a performer gets a reputation for being unreliable or
canceling at the last minute, that's a problem,'' says Richard
Johnson, a veteran Houston watcher at the Post. ''It seems that's
been happening with Whitney Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's husband of seven years, singer Bobby Brown, has his
own litany of woes: a 1995 Betty Ford Clinic visit for alcohol
abuse, a 1997 report that he punched Houston in a Honolulu parking
lot, and a 1998 five-day jail term for drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   The bad publicity is a relatively new experience for the gospel
singer's daughter, the all-American girl whose 1991 version of
''The Star Spangled Banner'' improbably turned Francis Scott Key
into a best-selling songwriter.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rash of incidents began in January, when airport
security officers in Hawaii said they found a half-ounce of
marijuana in Houston's bag. Rather than wait for police to arrive,
the 36-year-old Houston boarded her flight and left the islands.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Whitney's woes was a cover story in the May issue of
Jane magazine. The piece described an ''extremely unfocused''
Houston showing up four hours late for a photo shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, the singer responsible for 11 No. 1 singles had
''trouble keeping her eyes open'' and intermittently played an
imaginary piano, according to the story.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney's explanation: She had just arrived from a visit to the
dentist to repair a cracked tooth.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview for Jane, Houston tossed around four-letter
words, compared meeting the president to hanging out with a junkie
(''They're just men, you dig?''), and denied having a ''lesbo''
affair with her executive assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer said the article was not ''a fair portrait of Whitney
Houston as I know her.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, says Daily News gossip guru Mitchell Fink
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at her behavior over the last few years,'' Fink says.
''If you did a timeline over the last few years, you'd see that
this particular pattern of behavior is not at all shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems and tabloid rumblings have had little effect on her
recording career. Houston's 1998 album ''My Love is Your Love'' was
a platinum seller and spawned several hit singles: the title track,
''Heartbreak Hotel,'' ''When You Believe,'' ''It's Not Right But
It's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, she will release a greatest-hits album that is expected
to top the charts.

<HEADLINE> Aspirin Said OK for Stroke Victims  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Aspirin works just as well in preventing a second
stroke as a more risky blood thinner normally given to stroke
victims with irregular heartbeats just after the attack, according
to new research that experts say could help save thousands of lives
a year.
</P>
<P>
   People with irregular heartbeats who have had strokes are
susceptible to a second, major stroke soon afterward. They normally
are given a blood thinner called heparin to prevent clots, which
can cause a stroke by traveling to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether to use blood thinners in stroke victims
with erratic heartbeats and how potent they should be is
contentious, mainly because of the potential for internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Heparin, which prevents clots through a different mechanism than
aspirin, has been used for years in such cases, but without any
scientific evidence that it is useful, said Dr. Karen Furie, a
neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But a Norwegian study published this week in The Lancet medical
journal found heparin is no better than aspirin, which carries less
risk of hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We needed this evidence. This study answered an important
question and will have far-reaching consequences,'' said Furie,
adding that the results could help save thousands of lives
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional therapy involves an intravenous drip of heparin to
regulate the thickness of the blood or intermittent injections of a
different form of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Although aspirin carries less chance of bleeding, it has been
thought not to be potent enough to be used during the initial
two-week phase of stroke recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In the experiment by scientists at Ulleval University Hospital
in Oslo, 449 men and women with irregular heartbeats were given
either aspirin or heparin about 30 hours after having a stroke
caused by a blood clot traveling to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the drugs were continued for 14 days, the period
when a patient is most vulnerable to complications, such as another
stroke. The patients were about 80 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the incidence of a recurrent stroke
was about the same in the two groups -- 8.5 percent for those taking
heparin and 7.5 percent for those taking aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   There also was no difference between the two treatments when it
came to other complications of stroke, such as brain hemorrhage or
death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our study clarifies a long-term controversy ... and supports
use of aspirin instead of heparins,'' said the study's lead author,
Dr. Eivind Berge.
</P>
<P>
   Strokes are the third-leading killer in the United States,
striking about 600,000 people a year and killing about 160,000 of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Blood clots traveling to the brain cause about 60 percent of all
strokes, and an irregular heart leads to about a quarter of those
types of strokes, Furie said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will have a large impact,'' Furie said, adding that the
findings also could apply to other types of stroke.
</P>
<P>
   But she warned against people taking aspirin by themselves after
suffering a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   While most strokes are caused by a blood clot, some happen when
a vein ruptures, in which case taking an aspirin to thin the blood
would be a very bad idea. It is impossible to tell without seeing a
doctor what caused a stroke, Furie said.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian study was conducted at a time when new drugs are
being developed to limit brain damage caused by strokes and prevent
additional strokes from occurring.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the FDA approved a drug called Aggrenox that combines
aspirin with another blood thinner to prevent clots. It is for
patients who have suffered a full-blown stroke or a mini-stroke
called a transient ischemic attack and are at high risk of
suffering another stroke within days.

<HEADLINE> Company Sequences Human Genome  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A private company mapping the human genetic
blueprint said Thursday it has completed a major step -- decoding
all of the DNA pieces that make up the genetic pattern of a single
human being.
</P>
<P>
   The milestone puts the company, Celera Genomics of Rockville,
Md., far ahead of an international government effort to map the
human genome using a different method.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've now completed the gene sequence plan of one human
being,'' said Craig Venter, chief scientist for the company. He
said that human being was an unidentified male, adding, ''By the
end of next week, we will have finished the gene sequence for a
female.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors were pleased by the Celera announcement, pushing its
stock nearly 22 percent higher. Shares of PE Corp., Celera's parent
company, rose $25 to $140 in trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 3 billion DNA subunits in virtually every human
cell. This DNA contains about 100,000 genes. The gene sequencing
done thus far lines up small segments of the DNA. Assembly of the
entire genome will involve putting these segments in proper order.
</P>
<P>
   This process, said Venter, will take several weeks. But he said
the Celera work is far ahead of a similar effort by the
government-funded Human Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to declare absolute victory yet, but call me in
three or four weeks when it is all assembled,'' said Venter.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Francis Collins, the Human Genome Project's chief, said,
''I'm happy to hear that Celera has completed this part of their
business plan. We look forward to hearing how the assembly process
goes and ultimately seeing the sequence made available'' to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Venter said the ordered sequence of the human genes will not be
released to the public until it has been completely assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe a genome is done until there is an attempt to
identify the genes and the linear sequence along all of the
chromosomes,'' he said. ''We will not have that completed until
later this year.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's press secretary, Joe Lockhart, said the
Celera announcement ''marks a ... significant point in what the
president has talked about extensively as ... one of the most
important scientific developments of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Human Genome Project is expected to complete a ''rough
draft'' of the human gene sequence this spring, but this will not
be assembled into a finished order for several more years.
</P>
<P>
   The federal project is using a different method than that used
by Celera, which is using a technique developed by Venter.
</P>
<P>
   But, in contrast to Celera, the federal project is releasing to
the public the genetic sequences as they are identified. The
federal project thus far as put on the Internet the codes for about
2.3 billion subunits of the DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recently announced that the United States and Britain
have agreed to share data from their efforts to decode the human
genetic pattern. A U.S.-British statement urged private companies
to follow the lead of government laboratories in sharing data. Some
companies have shared data, while others have not.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before Congress, Venter said Thursday that his
company will make the entire genome available on the Internet, but
will provide special services for analyzing the massive amount of
data to drug companies and to universities for a subscription
price. Subscriptions for drug companies, he said, will cost
millions, while the rate for universities will be in the thousands
of dollars and not much more than what is now paid for some
advanced software.
</P>
<P>
   To decode the genetic sequence, Venter said his company drew
specimens from 30 different people. One specimen was then used to
draw up the completed sequence. A male was chosen because only
males have at least one copy of all the chromosomes, including the
X and Y sex chromosomes. Females have two Xs and no Ys.
</P>
<P>
   ''That one individual probably doesn't know who was selected for
sequencing, but probably knows about being a donor in the pool,''
said Venter. ''All 6 billion of us on this planet differ enough
from each other so that no one individual is significant. It is
significant only as a reference source and because it is the first
one.''
