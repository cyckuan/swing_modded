<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Guarantee Financial Institutions' Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government has
decided to guarantee the country's financial institutions'
payments of external debts, Vice Premier and Minister of Finance
and Economy Kang Kyong-shik said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an economic ministers' meeting, Kang said the
government will also extend special loans of up to 4 trillion won
(about 4.4 billion U.S. dollars) to banks to bail them out of the
financial crisis deepened by bankruptcies and near-insolvencies of
major conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
The moves are primarily designed to stabilize the domestic
financial market and to prop up the country's financial
institutions' overseas credit standing, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has planned to raise the stock
investment ceiling for foreigners to 26 percent of a listed
domestic firm next month from the existing 23 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Expanding foreign stock investment along with a set of similar
measures will bring an additional foreign exchange liquidity of
eight to 8.5 billion dollars into the domestic financial sector,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Government measures also include a wide opening of the domestic
bond market, an increase of overseas borrowing through
government-run banks, an extension of usance period and a removal
of limits on receipts of advance payments for exports.
</P>
<P>
The government will allow the financially-troubled banks,
including the Korea First Bank, to make rights issues and
undertake them through issuing bonds after acquiring the National
Assembly's approval, he said.
</P>
<P>
Korea First is the main creditor bank of the bankrupt Hanbo and
Sammi steel groups as well as the largest lender to the
near-insolvent Kia Group.
</P>
<P>
"Those financial institutions to receive the preferential
loans, however, will be obliged to make stringent self-rescue
efforts so as to normalize their management in three to five years
from now," the deputy premier said.

<HEADLINE> Inflation in Western Germany to Top 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate in the western
half of Germany is expected to jump to a 28-month high of 2
percent in August, up from 1.7 percent in July, the German federal
statistics office said today.
</P>
<P>
The Wiesbaden-based office, which based its projection on
preliminary data from four western German states, said rising fuel
prices due to the stronger U.S. dollar were to be blamed for the
latest increase in German inflation.
</P>
<P>
The larger-than-expected inflation rate is likely to reinforce
market speculations that the German central bank, the Bundesbank,
would be forced to raise interest rates which could curb price
hikes.
</P>
<P>
But many observers in the German financial capital of Frankfurt
did not expect the Bundesbank to take such a move at its Tuesday
meeting when it is due to conduct its weekly review of a key
benchmark rate, the securities repurchase rate.
</P>
<P>
Given the recent weakness of the dollar, the central bankers
would take some time to examine the price-related factors exactly,
an economist with the German Commerzbank said.

<HEADLINE> China Progressing Forward in Financial Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China has made remarkable
progress in financial reform, and the development of its capital
market, a Chinese banker said at the ninth annual PACAP Finance
Conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
Yin Jieyan, vice-governor of the People's bank of China, the
central bank, said that China has made a breakthrough to reform
its foreign exchange system, and current accounts of Chinese
Renminbi have become convertible freely with foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banking businesses have been separated from policy
businesses, and the reform of the country's financial system is
progressing smoothly, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has set up a sound financial system at a preliminary
stage, guided by the central bank, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Multiple financial institutes co-exist under such a system, but
state-owned commercial banks are still playing a leading role, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Yin said that China will approve 14 new commercial banks to be
set up, of which 10 are share-holding banks.
</P>
<P>
The number of cooperative banks in both rural and urban areas
has been increasing rapidly over the past few years,
</P>
<P>
The banker said that a healthy development has also
been seen in the non-banking sector over the past years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, this year, the country has had numerous
non-banking institutes in various forms, including 94 securities
companies, 245 trust and investment companies, and 14 insurers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China is speeding up opening-up of its financial
sector, Yin said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, about 540 overseas banks and other
financial institutes have opened representative offices in China,
and nine overseas banks have been licensed to do Renminbi-based
business in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will continues the pilot operation for
overseas banks to do Renminbi-based business, which means that
overseas banks will have more development opportunities in China.
</P>
<P>
China's capital market has been developing quickly over the
past years, and the size of China's stock market has been
expanding quickly, he noted.

TOKYO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Social Democratic Party

clarify Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama's remarks that
the proposed new Japan-U.S. defense guidelines would cover the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>

Kazuo Oikawa, chairman of the SDP's Policy-Making Board, sought

camp comprising the LDP, SDP and New Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama said in a Sunday TV talk show that the new defense
guidelines would cover emergencies in the Taiwan Straits. China
strongly criticized his remarks, saying it signaled an attempt to
interfere in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The SDP has maintained that the Taiwan Straits should be
excluded from the geographical scope of the new guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Because of the SDP's opposition, a final agreement on the
review of the guidelines by the three parties is likely to be
delayed until Friday or later, party officials said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Not to Revise Strategy Toward Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Cypriot Side will
not revise its strategy toward a Cyprus solution in spite of
recent deadlock in the U.N.-led direct talks between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot sides, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the 10th World Conference
of Overseas Cypriots here on behalf of President Glafcos
Clerides, Foreign Minister Ioaanis Kasoulides said recent direct
talks in Glion, Switzerland, failed to overcome the impasse.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that "this is not the end of the world and
does not imply we should revise our planned strategy or course."
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference, with the participation of
represenatives of overseas Cypriots from more than eight
countries, will discuss ways to promote a settlement of the
Cyprus problem and solve problems the overseas Cypriots face in
their host countries.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides told the delegates that it is the beginning of a
course by which the international community, based on
U.N. resolutions on Cyprus, will proceed to overturn the
unacceptable status quo on the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government, he assured, will show constructive
political will for a solution and at the same time its
commitment to internationally accepted principles and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides urged the international community to persuade
Turkey through friendly means and if necessary by imposing
sanctions to abandon its intransigent stance and assist toward a
Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made special mention of the close and
harmonious cooperation between the governments of Cyprus and
Greece, noting that their efforts and those of overseas Cypriots
and Greeks have contributed to attracting greater international
interest to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the conference, President of the International
Federation of Overseas Cypriots, George Christofides, called on
Cyprus, Greece and Hellenes of the diaspora to coordinate their
actions and speak with one voice.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the failure of two rounds of direct
negotiations between President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash in the U.S. and Switzerland, it is necessary
that the Greek Cypriot side re-consolidates its strength and
tactics in the direction of realising its rightful claims and
taking advantage of every measure of strength that Hellenism now
possesses in all parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded and occupied
the northern third of the island in 1974 in the wake of a
short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.

ABU DHABI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Investment in the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) exceeded 11 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, most of
which came from the private sector, the UAE's Wam news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Public and private investment in the UAE stood at around 11.1
billion dollars last year, compared with some 10.8 billion dollars
in 1995, Wam said.
</P>
<P>
The investment from the private sector accounted for nearly 66
percent of the total amount, standing at nearly 7.41 billion
dollars in 1996, it said.
</P>
<P>
It gave no figures for investment in the oil sector, which is
considered to be the major part of the country's economy, but
industry sources said nearly 1.9 billion dollars had been pumped
into this sector annually over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
Like other Gulf Arab states, the UAE has embarked on projects
to boost oil output capacity to face growing domestic and foreign
demand.
</P>
<P>
Currently, its oil output stands at around 2.5 million barrels
per day (bpd) and it is planning to increase the annual production
to some 3 million bpd in the next few years.

<HEADLINE> Some Bosses Deserve High Pay, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Managers in British privatized
utilities are underpaid by an average of 6 percent than their
counterparts in companies of similar size, according to a new
study released here today.
</P>
<P>
The study by Crisp Consulting which advises regulated
industries, and the Center for Economics and Business Research,
comes amid general concern in Britain that the pay of utilities'
directors rose disproportionately quickly after the companies were
privatized.
</P>
<P>
The study of pay levels at 75 FTSE 100 companies, concluded
that most privatized utility bosses were paid less than their
experience and company performance and size demanded.
</P>
<P>
It took into account directors' experience, the company's
market capitalization and their performance in generating
shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, Severn Trent's Victor Cocker, Ian
Robinson of Scottish-Power and Southern Electricity's Henry Casley
are among the most underpaid directors.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Roger Leverton, who has since been removed from
his post as group chief executive at Pilkingtonk, received almost
twice as much as would be expected elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"This study destroys a generally accepted myth about boardroom
pay," said John Hatch, executive chairman of Crisp Consulting.
</P>
<P>
Deborah Barlow, an author of the study, said that some of the
bosses in the privatized companies received 42 percent less than
directors in similar companies and with similar experience and
performance.
</P>
<P>
The study also claimed that a number of directors elsewhere in
the private sector were overpaid, some earning almost twice their
fair value, according to the model used in the study.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) failed to attend constitutional talks with
the National Coalition Executive Committee (NCEC) this morning
and the latter is threatening another national strike.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Vice President George Saitoti, who led the 37-member
KANU negotiation team, told reporters later that KANU will only
consult with legal opposition groups in parliament, instead of
the unregistered NCEC.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC, which is comprised of opposition parties to
coordinate campaign for constitutional reforms, was set up in
April by National Convention Assembly.
</P>
<P>
According to Saitoti, NCEC is a non-elected body without a
mandate, and therefore will not be recognized by KANU.
</P>
<P>
NCEC held the first round of reform talks anyway without KANU
attendance. After the meeting, the 65-member NCEC team announced
in a statement that it will call national strike again and the
detailed strike plan will be finished later this week.
</P>
<P>
NCEC will resume mass actions until the government shifts its
stand and holds talks with it, said the NCEC statement.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti stressed that the NCEC "objectives and methods are
sure recipe for chaos and civil war."
</P>
<P>
"KANU has consistently insisted that the envisaged dialogue
and consultation is with the opposition in parliament," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he reiterated KANU's "commitment to dialogue and
consultations with the opposition to ensure that necessary
reforms are undertaken in an orderly, peaceful and legal manner."
</P>
<P>
Violence has been escalating in the east African country since
May when the opposition started attempts to launch rallies and
strikes in a bid to press for constitutional reforms before the
general election, whose date is yet to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution, any candidate, if he wins no
less than 25 percent of votes respectively in five of the eight
provinces of Kenya, he can be qualified as a legal president.
</P>
<P>
Now the opposition urges to change the clause, demanding the
future president get more than 50 percent of the total votes
nationwide, otherwise form a coalition government with other
parties. This has already been refused by Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi, who has been in power since 1978.

<HEADLINE> UK Accounts Holders Dissatisfied With Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Almost 16 million holders of
current accounts are missing out on more than 130 million pounds
(208 million US dollars) a year in interest, according to the
latest banking survey from Abbey National.
</P>
<P>
A quarter of all current accounts pay no interest. Among those
surveyed who were receiving interest, a third were dissatisfied
with the rate.
</P>
<P>
The worst deal is from Lloyds, which pays only 1.20 pounds
(1.92 US dollars) a year on an account with an average monthly
balance of 750 pounds (1,200 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Mildland and NatWest both pay 1.50 pounds (2.4 US dollars) and
Barclays 1.80 pounds (2.88 US dollars). The best accounts pay 8.37
pounds (13.39 US dollars) (Abbey National) and 4.19 pounds (6.70
US dollars) (TSB).
</P>
<P>
Most banks and building societies pay a flat rate of interest
irrespective of the account balance.
</P>
<P>
So customers keeping large account balances with NatWest and
Midland earn just 0.25 percent a year, while Barclays' customers
earn 0.3 percent and Lloyds' receive 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Recently converted building societies Abbey National and
Woolwich pay 3.5 percent on balances of more than 25,000 pounds
(40,000 US dollars), beating the mutual Nationwide, which offers
3.25 percent, and Alliance &AMP; Leicester with 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Great Regional Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia today urged African
countries to make more rapid advance toward greater economic
integration at sub-regional and regional levels.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Lawrence Shimba said here that the
governments in the region have realized the need to come together
to coordinate their policies so as to benefit from the advantages
derived from economies of scale through regional integration.
</P>
<P>
He was opening a workshop jointly organized by the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) on regional policy program
and project management.
</P>
<P>
Shimba said that without a strong political commitment toward
integration, it will be difficult to translate treaties and other
instruments into practical and implementable measures.
</P>
<P>
many african countries have realized that it is only with the
private sector taking the lead in the production, distribution
and marketing of goods and services that meaningful progress will
be possible, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier, acting COMESA Secretary General Erastus
Mwencha expressed his hope that the workshop aims to enhance
technical knowledge and that skills would come first.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a general consensus among the COMESA member
states on the need for Africa to be more economically and
politically integrated.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha said the proposed COMESA timetable for the attainment
of a free trade area, a common external tariff, a customs union
and a single currency is realistic.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Cashew Industry Faces Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Another cashew processing
factory has shut down in Mozambique due to lack of raw materials,
the Southern African Broadcasting Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The plant at Manjacaze in the southern province of Gaza closed
last Wednesday due to lack of raw materials, and all 398 workers
at the factory have been laid off.
</P>
<P>
This brings to four the number of cashew processing plants
which have shut down in Mozambique because of the shortage of
nuts to shell.
</P>
<P>
Only 10 cashew processing plants remain operational in the
southern African country, with some of them expected to close
later this year, the report quoted a local daily The Noticias as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The closures are blamed on the government's policy to allow
the export of raw, unprocessed nuts to India and some other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's cashew industrial experts and trade union leaders
have been united in opposing the government's trade policy which
is being implemented at the instigation of the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Experts to Repair Liberia's Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- West African countries will send
a team of experts to assess the state of the telecommunications
network of Liberia devastated in the seven-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
A draft rehabilitation plan is to be produced following the
on-the-spot inspection by the experts sent by the executive
secretariat of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
A similar team will also visit the country to explore the
possibility of computerizing its customs administration, the
report said, quoting acting Executive Secretary Ouhoumoudou
Mahamadhou.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the dispatch of the two teams reflects the
desire of the 16-member organization to contribute to its
economic reintegration to the existing sub-regional schemes, some
of which eluded the country during the bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
With the new government already in place, Liberia should focus
on new challenges that need to be speedily addressed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Foremost among these are the issues of repatriation and
reintegration of refugees, rehabilitation of basic
infrastructure, national reconstruction and reintegration of
former solders," the acting executive secretary added.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remarks at an ECOWAS council of
ministers meeting which is scheduled to end today in Abuja,
capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Sierra Leone, he said, the crisis, which
came on the heels of the conclusion of the Liberian peace plan,
demonstrated the need for ECOWAS to consider the possibility of
introducing the community instruments envisaged in this area as
part of efforts to promote sub-regional stability.
</P>
<P>
Some soldiers launched a military coup on May 25 and overthrew
the legitimate government there. The international community
strongly condemns the coup and ECOWAS has tightened embargo and
sanctions against the country in a bid to force the coupists to
hand over power to the ousted government.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting is expected to review the performance of
sub-regional economic integration programs and propose solutions
to overcome identified bottlenecks to the ECOWAS summit.
</P>
<P>
Sub-regional peace and stability is projected to be high on
the agenda of the two-day summit, scheduled for the coming
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Florida's Lawsuit Against Tobacco Industry Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Florida state and the
tobacco industry ended their dispute today with the signing of an
11.3 billion dollars settlement of a lawsuit intended to punish
cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Florida Governor Lawton Chiles and
tobacco industry lawyer Arthur Golden in court today before Palm
Beach County Circuit Judge Harold Cohen.
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit, the state asked for 12.3 billion dollars --
1.3 billion dollars for tax money spent treating sick smokers
without insurance and 11 billion dollars to punish the industry.
</P>
<P>
The state won on three important battlegrounds: "protecting
Florida's children, making tobacco pay for the damage it has cost
our taxpayers and for cigarette makers to finally tell the truth,"
said April Herrle, a spokeswoman for Chiles.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the financial settlement, the industry agrees to
pull down all of its billboards within six months and start with
signs within 1,000 feet of schools. Vending machines where
children have access would be removed, and outdoor advertising in
sporting arenas and on mass transit would be banned.
</P>
<P>
The trial began in jury selection on August 1. In depositions,
tobacco executives had already conceded that smoking is harmful
and can cause deadly diseases.
</P>
<P>
The American Lung Association in Washington called the
agreement "significant."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Geoffrey Bible, the head of Philip Morris Cos.,
conceded in a deposition that smoking might have caused as many as
100,000 deaths. On Friday, Steven Goldstone, head of RJR Nabisco,
also said in a deposition that he believed "smoking plays a part
in causing lung cancer."
</P>
<P>
Florida is the second state to reach an agreement to recover
the Medicaid funds. On July 3, Mississippi state settled its
lawsuit against the tobacco industry, which agreed to pay nearly
3.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In Philadelphia today, U.S. District Judge Clarence Newcomer
certified a pending smokers' lawsuit as a class action and set a
trial date of October 14. The lawsuit represents some 10 million
smokers who say they were addicted and are seeking medical
monitoring for smoking-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress is looking over a proposed 368.5
billion dollar national settlement with 40 states.

<HEADLINE> ILO Business Workshop Opened in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A regional workshop of the
International Labor Organization (ILO) opened here today to draw
up strategies for an integrated "Start Your Business" (SYB)
program.
</P>
<P>
Opening the two-day workshop, Alois Mangwende, Zimbabwe's
Deputy Minister of Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare,
pointed out the importance of the meeting, saying it attempted to
resolve the issues of poverty alleviation, unemployment, the
right to work and sustainable economic development.
</P>
<P>
The SYB program, he said, was also a source of ownership and
management opportunities for women who often were held back by
lack of access to productive assets.
</P>
<P>
The SYB program started in July 1994 as a pilot project in
Uganda and Zimbabwe, and initially trained 200 people in business
skills.
</P>
<P>
The successes from the pilot program culminated in the
inclusion of Zambia and the fully-fledged launch of the program
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
There were 15 participating organizations in the three
countries and to date more than 600 persons have benefited from
the program, Mangwende added.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is being attended by 44 participants from Uganda,
Zambia, Sweden, Switzerland, South Africa, Ethiopia, Namibia,
Lesotho and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: No Change in Albright's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today denied reports that
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has changed her mind on
her upcoming visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no change in the program of Albright's visit to
the region," Arafat told reporters following talks with President
Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Today's summit was held in anticipation of the long-overdue
visit by the U.S. leader to the region, scheduled for sometime in
September, in a bid to revive the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also denied reports that the visit of U.S. Peace
Coordinator Dennis Ross to the region early this month aimed at
delaying Albright's visit.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security officials have been meeting with their
Israeli and U.S. counterparts under a framework set up earlier
this month during Ross' visit.
</P>
<P>
Albright has said her prospective trip to the region depends on
progress on security. Her mission will be to salvage peace talks
battered by the Israeli new settlement building and the July 30
Jerusalem suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
The PNA leader said the Palestinian side has shown cooperation
in the field of security in accordance with the signed agreements
and within the Palestinian law.
</P>
<P>
Arafat strongly denounced the "Israeli plots to sabotage the
Palestinian leaderships and opposition factions."
</P>
<P>
"It was officially reported in Israeli newspapers that a
(Israeli) unit was formed to work in Palestinian territories to
liquidate Palestinian leaderships," he said, adding that nobody
can intimidate the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Arafat thanked Egypt for the multi-million-dollar aid to the
Palestinians who are suffering from the Israeli economic sanctions
and said Algeria and Morocco have offered similar donations.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak issued a decree last week to transfer 10 million
U.S. dollars in aid to the PNA to relieve the Palestinian
sufferings. The Israeli punitive clampdown following the July 30
Jerusalem suicide bombings which killed 16 people has deprived
tens of thousands of Palestinians of work or salary.
</P>
<P>
He said Mubarak has briefed him on an urgent donation from
Sheikh Zayed Ben Sultan, head of the United Arab Emirates and
another aid from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Arafat renewed his call for convening an Arab summit to come up
with unified Arab strategy to face up to the major issues of the
Mideast peace process, including Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"This summit should discuss the future of Jerusalem, to
preserve it as the capital of the Palestinian state and as a holy
place for both Muslims and Christians," he added.
</P>
<P>
The construction of a new settlement in East Jerusalem in March
put the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks on hold. And the double
bombings last month upset a promised resumption of the
negotiations.

SINGAPORE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China is a major political
event in the Chinese people's life, Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In a joint interview with the local press, Li, who is here on
an official visit, said the party congress will stick to Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"China's reform and opening up will by no means change, but
enjoy further progress," the premier stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the political reform, Li said that some foreign friends and
press people have different viewpoints, as they believe that China
only undertakes economic reform, but not the political reform.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a misunderstanding, as the economic and political
reform are being carried out simultaneously in China," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China will further strengthen the democratic and legal
building, he said, adding this should be suitable to the Chinese
circumstances and characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"I believe after the 15th party congress, China's democratic
and legal building and supervision will be further strengthened,"
the premier added.

WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A former Ku Klux Klansman was
sentenced to 15 years in federal prison today for conspiring to
burn a rural black church and a migrant labor camp, the Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Hubert Rowell will also be on probation for five years after
his release from prison. He and Arthur A. Haley, another former

Church and a migrant labor camp in Clarendon County.
</P>
<P>
Haley was sentenced earlier this month to 21 and a half years

<P>
While neither Rowell nor Haley were charged with setting the
church fire, prosecutors said Haley provided flammable liquids and
Rowell mixed them and told two other men, Gary Christopher Cox and
Timothy Adron Welch, how to apply them.
</P>

Norton already has sentenced Cox to 19 and a half years and

SINGAPORE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China and Singapore will
explore new areas and new ways of cooperation so as to push
bilateral relations further ahead, visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint interview with the Singapore media, Li Peng
said that with the further development of relations between China

Singapore will become even closer.
</P>
<P>
"We need to explore new areas of cooperation as well as new

Singapore, especially in the field of high-technology," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We can also join hands to make investment in third counties,
set up joint ventures, or start joint ventures with the third
countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li also said that he had very good talks with Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong this afternoon. Goh said Singapore welcome
Chinese companies to list on the Singapore stock market. Li said
China will consider it seriously.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Condemns Firing at Former Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) today strongly condemned the
bloody incident last Saturday when former Zambian president
Kenneth Kaunda was wounded in a gun shot.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, ANC said, it "unequivocally condemned the
firing of shots against Kaunda", saying the incident did not
augur well for peace, democracy and development in Zambia or
Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The ANC condemns the use of force and violence as a means of
resolving political differences, the statement said, stressing
that every effort must be made to seek peaceful and lasting
resolution of political problems among different political
players in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The statement also expressed confidence in the ability of the
Zambian government to speedily investigate this incident and to
ensure the perpetrators of such deeds face the full might of the
law.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, now President of the United National Independence
Party, was reportedly grazed on his head when police fired
bullets to disperse a crowd at an illegal oppositional rally in
Kabwe, 150 km north of the capital, Lusaka. Kaunda was to address
the rally.
</P>
<P>
Several other Opposition alliance leaders, including Liberal
Progressive Front leader Rodger Chongwe, and their supporters
were also injured.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest source reaching here today, Zambian
police had denied firing at Kaunda and his supporters, claiming
that the police only used "tear gas cannisters" to disperse the
people.

<HEADLINE> Former East German Leader to Appeal Against Court Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Egon Krenz, the last leader of
the former East Germany, said today that he would appeal against a
rule by a Berlin court which sentenced him to six and a half years
in prison in connection with killings along the Berlin Wall during
the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement read by his son Carsten to a news
conference after the trial, Krenz said he was the victim of a
political trial and was sentenced without committing any crime.
</P>
<P>
He called on members of the United Nations (UN) to intervene as
a former UN member (East Germany) was being criminalized by the
German court.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that he would not ask for a pardon from Bonn.
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Robert Unger, said he would appeal to the German
supreme court within one week and, if necessary, to the German
constitutional court and the European Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg, France.
</P>
<P>
Krenz, 60, was convicted today of manslaughter related to the
death of people shot by East German border guards when trying to
flee East Germany through the former border areas along the Berlin
Wall.
</P>
<P>
He was placed under arrest and brought to the Moabit remand
prison in Berlin immediately after the trial.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court today also sentenced two other members of the
former East German Politburo, Guenter Schabowski, 68, and Guenther
Kleiber, 65, to three years in jail on similar charges.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German RTL television today, former
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev also criticized the trial, saying
that it violated the German reunification accord, which had spoken
of the former East Germany and West Germany as two sovereign
states.
</P>
<P>
As the last state and party leader of East Germany, Krenz had
acted within the framework of a sovereign state which had its own
laws, Gorbachev said. "There are neither legal nor moral reasons
for the convictions of Krenz and his comrades.... The trial is
nothing but politics loaded with demons of the past," he added.

HARARE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan embassy in Zimbabwe
today said today countries observing the Angolan peace process
have criticized the opposition UNITA movement for its failure to
comply with the requirements of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The embassy said in a statement that following a profound
analysis of information provided by the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) on August 11 concerning the
status of its troops, the administration of the state and the
status of UNITA's radio station Vorgan, observer countries
concluded that "UNITA does not fully comply with Security Council
resolution 1118 of June 30, 1997."
</P>
<P>
"The information concerning UNITA's forces is still incomplete
and that of its weapons still scanty," according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The observer countries recommended that additional information
should be communicated.
</P>
<P>
On the readjusted program for the extension of administration
proposed by UNITA, observer countries appealed to UNITA to
cooperate with the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
It was also decided that Radio Vorgan should stop broadcasting
hostile propaganda.

have good relations of friendship and cooperation. The policy of
creating a strategic partnership between China and Russia oriented
towards the 21st century, formulated by the leadership of the two
countries, has profound significance not only for the development
of the two countries' good relations, but also for peace and
stability in the Asian and Pacific region and the world as a
whole, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the economic construction in China, Liu said
that China, adhering to Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, has made considerable
headway in the economic construction, but it remains a developing
country with a large population. The task of China in the next
century is to continue to develop economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with Liu Huaqing, Urinson said that Russia and
China have achieved great successes in their cooperation thanks to
the common efforts.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the meeting between Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and Chinese Chairman Jiang Zemin held in Moscow in April
of the year and the meeting between Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Premier Li Peng in Beijing in June of this year
pointed the right orientation for the two countries' cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said when meeting with the Chinese leader that Russia
sees China as one of the most important strategic partners in Asia
and the Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"Russia and China have common views on many international
problems, while both of them need a stabilized domestic situation
in order to boost their economy. That is the base on which we
could develop our relations," the defense minister said.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev emphasized that the strategic partnership created
between Russia and china is not an expedient measure, but a long
relationship.
</P>
<P>
The two sides exchanged views on other problems of common
interest.
</P>
<P>
Today's meetings were attended by, from the Chinese side,
Lieutenant General Qian Shugen, deputy chief of the General Staff
of the People's Liberation Army; Cao Gangchuan, chairman of the
Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National
Defense; and Chinese Ambassador in Russia Li Fenglin; and, from
the Russian side, First Deputy Defense Minister Andrei Kokoshin,
Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Vladimir
Pahomov and Russian Ambassador in China Igor Rogachev.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government delegation headed by Liu Huaqing arrived
in Moscow on Sunday for an official visit at the invitation of
Russian Vice-Premier Yakov Urinson.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Liu Huaqing and his delegation in company with
Vladimir Pahomov visited the Moscow International Air Show, held
in the town of Zhukovskiy near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Urinson and his wife are expected to hold an official banquet
tonight in honor of Liu Huaqing and his wife Cu Hongxia.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos today held talks with visiting Arab League
Secretary General Abdel Meguid on the situation in the Middle East
and Athens' relations with the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
During their one-hour talks, Pangalos and Meguid also discussed
the role of the European Union (EU) in the Middle East peace
process, the incorporation of certain Arab countries such as Iraq
and Libya in the international community and prospects for the
development of Greece's relations with these countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the talks, pangalos said the
confrontation of the Palestinian problem would depend on the
behavior of the Israeli government towards the Palestinian
population.
</P>
<P>
The EU had means at its disposal to exert pressure on Israel
and should use them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Meguid said that he welcomed the appointment by the
EU of an envoy for the Middle East and rejected the measures taken
by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced support for a peaceful resolution of the Cyprus
problem.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives today asked for 400 million
shillings (634,000 U.S. Dollars) from the treasury for the spray
of red locusts in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Agriculture Njelu Kasaka said here that the
locusts are threatening plants at Malagarasi in Kigoma, Lake
Rukwa valley in Rukwa, Wembere area between Tobara and Singadi
regions and Bahi in Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
The latest outbreak of red locusts was reported at Bahi and
experts from the ministry have been sent there to survey the
situation, Kasaka said.
</P>
<P>
The money will be spent in paying for the spray of
insecticides to be done by the Addis Ababa-based Desert Locust
Control Organization -- East Africa.
</P>
<P>
The last spray on swarms of locusts was done in February this

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Ship Food to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will deliver a shipment of
150 tonnes of flour, 100 tonnes of sugar and 100 tonnes of rice to
the Palestinians in another move to relieve their plight under the
Israeli sanctions, the Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian assistance is to reach the Palestinian self-rule
areas via Rafah checkpoint once arrangements with the Israeli side
are finalized, said Mahmoud Karim, Egypt's Ambassador to the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
"This will greatly help the Palestinians to ride out the severe
economic situation brought about by the Israeli siege," Karim said.
</P>
<P>
Also, Egypt will allow Palestinians, who could not make it back
to their homes from holidays as a result of the Israeli embargo,
to enter Egypt. The legislative Palestinian Council had asked the
Egyptian Embassy in Gaza for that facility, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel froze custom duties and tax revenues due to the PNA and
imposed overall closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip following
the July 30 Jerusalem suicide bombings, depriving tens of
thousands of Palestinians of their jobs and salaries.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak issued a decree last week to transfer 10 million U.S.
dollars in aid to the PNA to relieve the Palestinian sufferings.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Egypt today, PNA President Yasser Arafat
thanked Cairo for the multi-million-dollar aid to the Palestinians
under the economic sanctions. He said Algeria and Morocco have
offered similar donations.
</P>
<P>
The construction of a new settlement in East Jerusalem in March
put the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks on hold. Double suicide
bombings in a Jerusalem market place last month upset the
resumption of the negotiations.

<P>
SINGAPORE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng dismissed here today the so-called "China threat theory" as
totally groundless, and reiterated that China will continue to
focus on the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Asked by a reporter from Television Corporation of Singapore
(TCS) at a joint interview with the local media on what China will
do to further develop its economic strength without causing
concerns in the neighboring nations, Premier Li pointed out that
China is pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
"Our defense forces are absolutely for the purpose of national
defense," Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's development requires a peaceful and stable
international environment, especially peace in the neighboring
areas. China is putting economic development at the very center of
all its undertakings, the Premier said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China is fully aware that although its economy
has been developing at a rate of more than nine percent per annum,
the average income of the Chinese people remained low due to the
large population and the economic developments throughout the
country are uneven.
</P>
<P>
Despite the great achievements China has made since reform
started in late 1970s, it still needs dozens of years of hard work
to reach the level of the medium-developed countries in terms of
the economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li is here since Sunday on a three-day official visit and will
leave for home on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Become Tougher With Youth Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Justice Minister Anne
McLellan will set out harsher penalties for youths convicted for
serious and violent crimes, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
Canada is in danger of destroying and undermining the
credibility of its entire youth-offenders structure, the minister
warned in a speech to the Canadian Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
She hinted at legislating tougher sentences, prosecuting more
youths in adult court and naming some of those convicted of
violent offenses.
</P>
<P>
"For me, it's a pretty shocking statistic that six or seven out
of every 10 Canadians have no confidence in the Youth Offenders
Act," she was quoted by the Globe and Mail newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Why is that so? It's because of that very small number of
serious and violent young offenders who Canadians feel are not
being dealt with appropriately by our justice system."
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to do some rebalancing in relation to that
group of young offenders," she said.
</P>
<P>
McLellan said she was impressed with a task-force
recommendation that youths older than 14 found guilty of murder or
other violent offenses be transferred to adult court for
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
As for the 85 percent of young offenders who are guilty of less
serious crimes, she favors "restorative justice," in which
offenders make amends for their actions instead of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Canada implemented a series of youth-justice reforms in 1995,
which saw maximum sentence for a youth found guilty of
first-degree murder increase to 10 years and the 16- and 17-year
olds charged with violent offenses face trial in adult court.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the changes were criticized as inadequate by opponents who
were seeking tougher penalties for young offenders.

combined technological and financial development and management
provided by Israel Aircraft Industries and the Hyatt Corporation.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the organization said that the new Galaxy will
be the first aircraft of its kind to be capable of flying non-stop
between New York and Paris at lower operating costs than any other
business jet available on today's market. The Galaxy is designed
to accommodate between 8-19 passengers.
</P>
<P>

SINGAPORE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China will take comprehensive
steps to improve efficiency of its state-owned enterprises,
visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are most confident of the progress of our state-owned
enterprises," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In a joint interview with the local Press this afternoon, the
Premier recalled that at the National People's Congress sessions
this spring, he had put forward six-point measures to deal with
the issue, as it arouses the country's great concern.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot say all of the state-owned firms are money-losing,
for some of them are well-managed while some others are poorly
operated," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that China is shifting from the centrally-planned
system to a market economy and the technology is advancing in a
continuous way.
</P>
<P>
When an enterprise goes all out to do a good job, it needs a
good mechanism, a good management team, quality products and
advanced technology, thus selling well at the market, Li added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier, who is here on a three-day official visit,
is scheduled to leave for Beijing tomorrow afternoon by a special

The U.S. senators, who arrived in the northern Greek port city

Bilirakis told reporters after the meeting that in the United

<P>
"This is why we make such trips so that we can see with our own

particularly the region of Macedonia," he explained.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canada Welcomes WTO Report on EU Beef Import Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada today welcomed a
favorable World Trade Organization's (WTO) panel report on the
European Union's (EU) ban on imports of its beef.
</P>
<P>
The report supports Canada's long-standing position that the
import ban imposed by the EU was "not consistent" with its
obligations under the WTO, said Sergio Marchi, Canada's
international trade minister.
</P>
<P>
"This important finding also underlines that Canada's trade
interests are best defended through a rules-based system," the
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the EU imposed a ban on imports of Canadian beef
produced with growth-promoting hormones. The EU said that the ban
was a health protection measure.
</P>
<P>
Canada argued that internationally accepted studies have
consistently found that the use of the growth hormones presents no
danger to beef consumers.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Canada requested a WTO dispute-settlement panel after
direct consultations with the EU failed to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The EU still has the right to appeal the finding of the report.

<HEADLINE> Cote d'Ivoire Denies Mediation in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Cote d'Ivoire government
today denies allegations that it would participate in mediation
on Angolan clashes.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made here in an communique by the Cote
d'Ivoire foreign ministry to its Angolan counterpart.
</P>
<P>
This is the first reaction by the Ivorian government after the
recent visit by Jonas Savimbi, chairman of the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique available here, this position
taken by the Ivorian government is mainly aimed at avoiding
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that with the aid of the three observer
countries, namely the United States, Russia and Portugal, the
United Nations had achieved positive results in mediating armed
clashes in Angola and that the government of Cote d'Ivoire has
never intended to participate in the mediation.
</P>
<P>
The recent meeting between Ivorian President Henry Konan Bedie
and Savimbi in Abidjan, said the communique, was proposed by the
U.S. government, in an attempt to persuade Savimbi into
cooperating with the Angolan government in the light of the
Lusaka Peace Accord signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it added, what Savimbi told the press on the likely
mediation by Cote d'Ivoire has nothing to do with the Ivorian
Government.
</P>
<P>
The Ivorian government believes that any parallel mediation on
the Angolan conflict would only lead to chaos and postpone the
peace process, said the communique.

YAOUNDE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Schools in Yaounde today
received teaching materials from the European Union (EU). The
exercise is part of the EU's program to distribute teaching
materials to 7,510 schools in Cameroun.
</P>
<P>
The teaching materials are intended to facilitate the teaching

</P>
<P>
The gifts from the EU to the government of Cameroun fall
within the framework of the reinforced structural adjustment
program to ameliorate the quality of teaching techniques in
Camerounian schools.
</P>
<P>
According to the EU officials who took part in today's

an essential factor to achieve sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The teaching materials distributed by the DU include rulers,
compasses and test books.
</P>
<P>
The distribution of teaching materials started in the economic

<HEADLINE> EX-Irish PM Haughey Likely to Face Prosecution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Former Irish Prime Minister
Charles Haughey was likely to face criminal prosecution on charges
of accepting a large amount of cash payments from an Irish
business tycoon, press reports from Dublin said.
</P>
<P>
An official Irish government report on illegal payments to
government officials was quoted as saying today that Haughey's
initial failure to admit receiving cash payments might have
amounted to an offence and the report also called for the Director
of Public Prosecutions to make a ruling.
</P>
<P>
Haughey, three times Prime Minister, had been one of the most
powerful political leaders of Ireland. At the beginning of the
government investigation, Haughey flatly denied any allegations of
receiving any illegal cash payments but last month Haughey
admitted that he had received some 1.3 million Irish pounds (about
1.9 million U.S. dollars) from Irish businessman Ben Dunne.
</P>
<P>
Judge Brian McCracken, head of the investigation team, said
although there was no evidence that any favors had been either
sought or granted over the payments, Haughey would be charged with
hiding these payments from the tax authorities.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite unacceptable that a member of Dail Eireann
(parliament), and in particular a cabinet minister and a Taoiseach
(prime minister), should be supported in his personal lifestyle by
gifts made to him personally," McCracken said in his report.
</P>
<P>
"The attitude of Mr Charles Haughey in relation to the Tribunal
might amount to an offence. All relevant papers will be sent to
the Director of Public Prosecutions for his consideration," report
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report called for tougher measures on
monitoring and investigating similar cases.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, a former colleague of
Haughey, has promised to take tougher measures to ensure there
should be no secret large gifts or payments to government
officials.
</P>
<P>
"I am determined to protect the integrity of our political
decision-making and to see that any attain to that integrity is
exposed," Ahern said.

<P>
BONN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Twenty five people were injured in
an unintended firework explosion late Sunday evening at a festival
in the western German city of Dortmund, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The huge firework loaded with 2.2 kilograms of explosives was
fired correctly from the ground at about 23:00 Sunday evening.
Instead of exploding in the air, it dropped to the ground from a
height of about 100 meters and blew up in a crowd of spectators,
police said today.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen people who suffered from burns and shocks were
immediately brought to nearby hospitals. Another nine were treated
in ambulances on the scene. Until this evening, two of them still
remained in a special hospital.
</P>
<P>
An investigation was launched today by local authorities, but
the exact reason for the firework mulfunction was still unknown so
far. The German manufacturer of the firework, Nico
Feuerwerktechnik, said a similar accident had never occurred in
Germany before.

<HEADLINE> Texas Jail Sued for Abusing Inmates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Missouri state officials, who
sent prisoners to live in a Brazoria County jail in Texas, today
sued the county for allegedly covering up the abuse of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners were videotaped being bitten by a dog and shocked
by a stun gun in last September, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The state accused the county of breach of contract, saying that
officials there deliberately withheld information about what
happened to the Missouri prisoners in rented cells in the Brazoria
jail.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Jay Nixon, who filed the lawsuit in Cole
County Circuit Court in Missouri's capital, was quoted as saying
that the county officials had refused to turn over information,
including inmate requests for medical attention, officer reports
and medical records even though they are required to do so under
the contract with the state of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
The videotape taken at the Brazoria County Detention Center
near Houston last September by deputies for training purposes. The
videotape, surfaced earlier this month, showed deputies forcing
the newly arrived Missouri inmates to crawl on their stomachs,
zapping them with stun guns and letting an attack dog bite them.
</P>
<P>
It prompted Missouri Corrections chief Dora Schriro to pull
hundreds of inmates from Brazoria and two other Texas jails and
cancel 12 million dollars worth of contracts.
</P>
<P>
Brazoria County, Sheriff Joe King and County Judge John Willy
are named as co-defendants in the lawsuit, which seeks unspecified
monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners were sent to three Texas jails managed by a private
company, Capital Correctional Resources Inc., because of
overcrowding in Missouri.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Cape Verde Minister of
Health, Labor and Social Affairs Joao Medina today said Angola
must realize peace to boost its social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement to the press here after a meeting with
Angola's Acting Prime Minister Castro Loy.
</P>
<P>
Blessed with rich natural resources, Angola will find its road
for social and economic advancement and make its contributions to
the world, especially to Africa after peace returns to the
country, Medina noted.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Medina said, Angolan Foreign Minister
Venancio de Moura's forthcoming visit to Cape Verde on Wednesday
and the visit by Cape Verde' Prime Minister Carlos Veiga to
Angola on September 7 will usher in a new stage of the bilateral
ties of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The enhanced relations between the two countries will be
conducive to the stability in both the region and the African
continent, but to the livelihood of the peoples of the two
countries as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
Medina arrived in Luanda on August 20 for a one-week working
visit to the country, in a bid to promote bilateral cooperation
in the social spheres.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Drives Further Away from EU, Says Greek FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos today warned that Turkey was driving itself
further away from the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
He made the warning while commenting on Sunday's statements by
Turkish European Union and Cypriot Affairs Minister Sukru Gurel
that Turkey would consider withdrawing its application for full
accession to the EU unless the union included Ankara in the first
round of EU expansion.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said that no progress could be made in this way between
Turkey and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Ankara was driving itself to "marginalization", he said, adding
that this was not designed by Athens, which favors the development
of the neighboring country's European orientation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas today
also said that Turkey was far away from meeting even the most
basic criteria for equal participation into the EU.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Science Spacecraft Launched After Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A science spacecraft, the
Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), was launched today from the
Cape Canaveral Air Station after a one-day delay.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing Delta II rocket carrying the ACE roared away from the
Air Station at 10:39 a.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday the launch countdown was halted by two shrimp boats
anchored in the Atlantic where the rocket's nine strap-on rocket
boosters would fall.
</P>
<P>
One was chased away, but the other did not respond to radioed
demands that it clear the area. The delay probably cost NASA
hundreds of thousands of dollars, space experts said.
</P>
<P>
Before today's launch, the U.S. Coast Guard chased one fishing
trawler out of the danger area east of Cape Canaveral, but there
was no delay.
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft was to separate from the rocket about 70 minutes
after launch and begin a long coast to a position nearly 1.6
million km from Earth.
</P>
<P>
It will provide a 30 to 60 minute warning before a potentially
dangerous solar storm strikes the Earth.
</P>
<P>
Eruptions on the surface of the sun can disrupt the Earth's
magnetic field, knocking out electrical power and endangering
spacewalking astronauts in orbit.
</P>
<P>
The ACE spacecraft's primary purpose is to sample the high
energy matter from the sun, the space between stars and from the
Milky Way that comes close to the Earth.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Aviation Industry Performs Poorly in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's aviation industry has
suffered from serious setback in the past year, with big drops in
both domestic passenger movement and aircraft movement in its
three major airports.
</P>
<P>
In Lagos, the commercial hub of the country in the southwest,
the number of passengers travelling by air declined from 157,369
in January 1996 to 95,188 one year later. The figure further went
down to 87,025 in June this year.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kano, northern Nigeria, is not anything
better with the figure dropping from 22,399 in January 1996, to
18,278 and 16,711 in January and April this year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In Port Harcourt, the country's oil producing base in the
south, 33,658 passengers patronized airline companies in January
1996, while only 28,587 and 20,037 did so in January and May this
year respectively.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian television authority report said today that many
passengers refused to take planes because of the poor safety
standard of the domestic airline companies.
</P>
<P>
"The companies are not taking care of what they have, so
people don't want to lose their life," a passenger was quoted as
saying in the Lagos Airport in a live broadcast.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the federal airport authority of
Nigeria admitted that poor safety was crucial to the drastic drop
in the number of passengers travelling by air, particularly
following the fatal crash of an aviation development company
passenger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Last November, a Boeing 727 of the domestic airlines crashed
into the lagoon near Lagos, killing all the 143 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
In the same month, the number of passengers dove to 122,307
from the previous month's 178,192.
</P>
<P>
Unsatisfactory service is another major cause.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the poor performance of the aviation industry is
also witnessed in the declining aircraft movement.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, inadequate maintenance and lack of
fund as well as equipment have led to the grounding of 77
unserviceable passenger airplanes.
</P>
<P>
To date, only seven of all registered passenger planes in the
country are operating scheduled flights, it added.
</P>
<P>
As a result, aircraft movement in the airports in Lagos and
Kano went down from 4,093 and 1,058 in January 1996 to 2,575 and
440 the same month this year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that measures should be taken so that
airline operators can have ease access to financing.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian FM Hopes to Settle S. Leone Crisis Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi said today west African countries are hoping to resolve the
crisis in Sierra Leone as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the foreign ministers meeting of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Ikimi said review has
been made on the happenings since a military coup overthrew
Sierra eone's legitimate government on May 25.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the review will enable the ECOWAS committee
of four on Sierra Leone, composed of foreign ministers of
Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire, to brief the council of
foreign ministers which is scheduled to meet tomorrow in Abuja,
the Nigerian capital.
</P>
<P>
it will also enable the committee "to put together our
recommendations to the heads of state at the ECOWAS summit in
Abuja on August 28 and 29," Ikimi said, quoted by the Nigerian
Television Authority.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our recommendations will indeed include concrete
measures that will be put in place to ensure that the central
objective of ECOWAS, that is to say, the early reinstatement of
Sierra Leone's legitimate government of President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah, has been considered consistently in the past," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sierra Leonean ambassador to Nigeria was also
quoted as saying he hoped that the ECOWAS heads of state could
resolve the crisis in his country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"As long as it (the military junta in power in Sierra Leone)
stays, the Sierra Leoneans suffer," the envoy added.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS, the 16-member sub-regional economic bloc, has faced
with political crisis at all its meetings since 1990 following
the outbreak of Liberia's civil war. It has to dwell largely on
the issue of conflict in one of its member country after another.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Liberian crisis has been resolved once and for
all but the sub-region is facing another crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the issue will be put high on the
agenda of the coming ECOWAS summit.

<HEADLINE> Ross not Decided to Return to Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- There is no fixed date for
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross to return to the Middle East as Israel
has disclosed, the State Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin was responding to a
report that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said
Ross intended to travel to the region to follow up on Palestinian
promises to improve security ties with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"Dennis Ross has made no decision to travel to the region, so
that (report) is not correct," Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But he assured the reporters at a regular briefing that Ross
will surely accompany Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on her
trip to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Ross "will make a decision about his travel in the context of
the secretary's decision about her travel," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also said reports about her postponement of the Middle
East were "erroneous", saying: "Secretary Albright does intend to
travel to the Middle East very soon."
</P>
<P>
"The prospects for advancing the peace process on that trip
would be advanced if the Palestinian Authority were in a position
to provide additional information (on security matters)...
so that the focus would not be on security, but the focus
could be on restoring the trust and confidence that has been so
unfortunately lost," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Smuggling on the Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The volume of cigarette
smuggling has nearly tripled in the last decade, the New York
Times reported today, citing research data.
</P>
<P>
A total of 280 billion of the 1 trillion cigarettes exported
each year by all producing nations pass through the hands of
smugglers, up from 100 billion in 1989, the paper quoted the
London-based research firm Market Tracking International Ltd. as
saying.
</P>
<P>
One-fourth of the cigarettes sold overseas pass through
smuggling rings set up to evade foreign taxes and sell major
brands at a discount, it added.
</P>
<P>
Recent criminal investigations in several countries show that
big cigarette makers have played a significant role at times in
stimulating the smuggling activity, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, two organized crime groups in Italy take in 500
million U.S. dollars a year by smuggling in Marlboros they buy
from Swiss dealers selling products made by the Philip Morris
companies, the largest U.S. cigarette maker, it went on.
</P>
<P>
The R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the second largest U.S.
cigarette maker, sponsored trips to a luxury Canadian fishing
resort for several dealers who have since been charged with
conspiring to smuggle cigarettes into Canada, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The rise in smuggling also has coincided with a huge push by
the American companies to expand overseas, which they see as a way
to offset a a decline in sales at home," the paper said, noting
that the smuggling costs foreign governments an estimated 16
billion U.S. dollars a year in lost revenue.

<HEADLINE> ADB Provides Technical Assistance to Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has approved two technical assistance (TA) grants worth some
1.1 million U.S. dollars to Nepal for its capital market
development project and rural finance project.
</P>
<P>
While the ADB has provided a similar assistance for the
development of capital market in Nepal, the new TA grant of
596,000 dollars will help examine how to revive and further
develop Nepal's capital market into a more reliable and efficient
mechanism to mobilize savings for growing private investment, said
a press release distributed today by the ADB's resident office in
Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at strengthening the monitoring and
enforcement functions of the Securities Board and modernizing the
Nepal Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has also been extensively involved in the rural finance
sector in Nepal in the past and therefore recognizes that rural
credit is one of the critical inputs for raising the incomes of
the impoverished rural population, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that a number of financial institutions have
been engaged in rural credit delivery, it is estimated that such
formal credit supply covers only about 20 percent of the total
demand, the release noted.
</P>
<P>
Therefor, the ADB will also provide a 500,000 dollar TA grant,
which will be implemented over a period of five months, to assist
Nepal in formulating a Rural Finance Investment Project, said the
press release.

<HEADLINE> 900 Million Asians Live in Poverty: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- As many as 900 million Asians
live in dire poverty despite the fact that Asia's surging growth
has brought the region unprecedented prosperity, the World Bank
said in reports released here today.
</P>
<P>
The reports, entitled "Everyone's Miracle? Revisiting Poverty
and Inequality in East Asia and India: Achievements and Challenges
in Reducing Poverty," described how poverty has fallen
dramatically in East Asia, which is down 27 percent from 1975 to
1985 and a further 35 percent from 1985 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the reports noted that two-thirds of the world's poor
still live in the regions, struggling to live on less than a
dollar a day, which is used by the World Bank as the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that national development cannot be assured
when so many people live without the basic amenities of life, and
lack the means to better themselves.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that poverty has been largely eradicated in
the four "tiger" economies -- Hong Kong of China, South Korea,
Singapore and Taiwan of China -- and has sharply declined in other
countries such as Indonesia and Thailand, as many as 350 million
people are still caught in its grip especially in the new emerging
economies of Cambodia, China, Laos, Mongolia and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In countries such as China, Indonesia, Malaysia and the
Philippines, where poverty reduction has been more successful, the
reports noted, there is apprehension that there are still millions
who are being left behind as national prosperity rises. Rural
areas have substantially higher incidence of poverty than urban
areas. In some countries, poverty is twice as high in rural areas
than urban.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the World Bank gave a warning of increasingly
widespread inequality.
</P>
<P>
One of the key features of this inequality is the growing gap
in earning power between skilled and unskilled workers in
increasingly sophisticated economies. The bank claimed that across
Asia, the rate of increase of demand for skilled workers has
outstripped the rate of supply, raising earnings differentials
across many occupations.

<HEADLINE> US Demand for Durable Goods Drops Again in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Orders for durable goods
fell 0.6 percent in July, the second drop in three months, partly
as a result of slack demand for aircraft and electronic and
communications gear, the Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
It said that orders totaled a seasonally adjusted 180.5 billion
U.S. dollars, down from 181.6 billion dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods such as trucks and turbines expected
to last more than three years are a major measure of the nation's
manufacturing strength.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline, analysts say the manufacturing sector
remains healthy.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders slipped 0.6 percent, the first
decline since April. Meanwhile, shipments, a measure of current
demand, rose 1.7 percent, the sixth advance in seven months.
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders slipped 3.5 percent after surging 8.8
percent in June. Declining demand for aircraft more than offset
increased orders for motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the transportation component, orders were up 0.3
percent, the third increase in the last four months.
</P>
<P>
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment also
dropped, down 13.6 percent after a 2.6 percent dip in June.
</P>
<P>
However, demand for industrial machinery and equipment
increased 5.9 percent on top of June's 1.1 percent advance. And
orders for primary metals rose 3.5 percent, the eighth increase in
nine months.
</P>
<P>
The orders for military equipment fell 6.6 percent after
jumping 13.5 percent a month earlier. Excluding this component,
orders were down 0.4 percent. Orders for nonmilitary capital goods
excluding aircraft rose 5.3 percent, even stronger than June's 3
percent gain.

<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- London, the British capital, is
regarded as the most popular location in Britain for companies for
the second year running, according to a survey published today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Black Horse, a relocation company,
said that Birmingham also retains its second place while
Manchester is in the third place.
</P>
<P>
Black Horse asked 1,000 businessmen to grade cities according
to a range of relocation factors, including the cost and quality
of local resources, transport, the business environment, the
personal quality of life, government incentives and the quality of
potential local clients.
</P>
<P>
Brighton, the Sussex seaside town, is rated as the least
popular city for business, trailing behind Dudley, in the West
Midlands, and Halifax, in West Yorkshire.
</P>
<P>
Availability of a quality workforce was ranked as the top
priority for companies on the move by nearly 50 percent of those
who took part in the survey as it is vital to the success of any
business, large or small, said the director of Black Horse Richard
Day.

<HEADLINE> Illegal-Staying Aliens Urged to Leave Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Interior Ministry of
Saudi Arabia today urged all foreigners staying illegally in the
kingdom to immediately leave for their home countries or they
would face prison and fines.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement carried by Saudi Press News
Agency that the overstayers in the country who will leave
immediately would be pardoned of imprisonment and financial
fines. But it did not give a time limit for them to leave the
country.
</P>
<P>
The statement said those who do not abide by the regulations
concerning illegal staying foreigners would be subject to a
two-year imprisonment and a fine that could be up to 27,000
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Those who mostly violate the regulations are people who arrive
in Saudi Arabia to perform the Muslim pilgrimage ritual,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Every year, millions of Muslims from all over the world flock
to the kingdom to perform religious pilgrimage during Haj, but
some of them continue to stay in the country illegally after the
festival.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi authorities launched an organized campaign three
year ago to apprehend those who breaches residence laws and
deport them to their home countries.
</P>
<P>
Before last year's pilgrimage season, the Saudi government
worked out an understanding with other Islamic countries on
applying more disciplined regulations to insure that foreigner
do not stay in the kingdom after performing their rituals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry also warned Saudi citizens and local
companies against employing the violators or assisting them in a
way they could continue their illegal stay.

<HEADLINE> New Claims Link Mad Cow Disease to Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Contaminated water supply might
be a source of infection for the brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (CJD), the human counterpart of mad cow disease, The Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Gary Skillet, a former building contractor at Canterbury Mills
rendering the carcasses of slaughtered cattle which may had been
infected with mad cow disease, disclosed that the liquid waste of
the carcasses in the plant was poured down a well.
</P>
<P>
However, David Richardson, director of the mills, denied the
allegation, saying that they had "never put anything down the well
other than rain water."
</P>
<P>
The Canterbury Mills, a rendering plant near Godmersham, is
believed to be the only one in Britain, which spread its effluent
across fields where drinking water is taken.
</P>
<P>
Skillet said the workers at the Canterbury Mills used a well to
get rid of liquid waste from carcasses disposed of under the
government's culling program.
</P>
<P>
The effluent was regularly pumped into the 50-feet-deep well
which links with a water supply system for a large area of east
Kent, where three persons living within 20 miles from the mills
died of new-variant of CJD, he added.
</P>
<P>
Alan Colchester, a consultant neurologist at Guy's Hospital in
London who has treated three of the new-variant CJD cases from
Kent, has already voiced his concern over a possible link with
contaminated water.
</P>
<P>
He said on Monday that he was anxious to know whether effluent
from the rendering process had leaked into the water supply system
because it could be a route of infection.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia: More Jobs to Nationals, No to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia today urged
local employers to enlist more nationals and turn away the
expatriates, who account for one-third of the country's
population, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Musaid Al-Sinani
said his ministry has notified all departments about the
necessity in this respect, according to Saudi Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided that Saudi institutions should
increase employment of nationals by 5 percent per year and reserve
certain jobs for Saudis such as auditing, treasury, civil and
security guarding, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said various departments and sectors are
cooperating with the government to ensure employment priority for
nationals.
</P>
<P>
The country's sixth five-year Development Plan (1995-2000)
calls for the creation of nearly 660,900 jobs for Saudis until the
turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia now hosts about 6.5 million foreign workers from
190 countries, mainly from south Asian and Arab states. Saudi
Arabia's population is around 18 million with the expatriates
included.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom decided to stop renewing and issuing work permits
to expatriates in 13 professions in October last year, and in
seven more categories last month.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and the other member states of the Gulf
Cooperation Council -- Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain,
Oman and Qatar -- are all in a drive to replace foreign workers
with nationals.
</P>
<P>
However, local economists observed that getting rid of foreign
laborers and replacing them with local workers is causing problems
in the job market because the region's education system cannot
cater for the demand of various skills by the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Czech PM Rejects U.S. Allegation on Citizen Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus
has rejected allegations from the U.S. Congress that the country's
Citizen Law was biased, and reiterated that the law would not be
amended.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to an open letter addressed to
him last week by two U.S. congressmen that said the Czech
Republic's current Citizen Law is unfair toward Czech Gypsies, or
Roma, as they preferred to be called, and should be revised.
</P>
<P>
The allegations stem from the current wave of emigration of
Czech Roma who seek permanent residence in Canada.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Czech citizens do not need visas to visit
Canada, so Roma simply apply for residence or refugee status once
they reach Canada.
</P>
<P>
But Klaus said recently that he didn't expect Canada to accept
Czech Roma and discouraged mass emigration.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 200,000 ethnic Roma live in the Czech Republic
now.

ROME, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Italian footballers union
(AIC) expressed its support Tuesday for a strike call in Spain to
protest against the growing number of non-European players.
</P>
<P>
AIC president Sergio Campana explained that he backed the
protest because Italy has the same problem.
</P>
<P>
The AIC has won its battle in the Serie A to maintain a limit
of a maximum of three non-European players per team on the pitch
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
But Campana pointed out that if the League changes
 the rules again, they will prepare to go on strike. "We're ready
for any confrontation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Professional Soccer League and the Spanish Soccer
Federation last month made a deal to limit the number of "foreign"
players to six on each team with four allowed on the pitch at one
time. But the local players were not satisfied and voted to call a
strike on Monday.

HONG KONG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Airport
Authority (AA) today signed an agreement on the operation of
airside bus services at the New Airport now under construction at

</P>
<P>
HAS will also provide regular airside shuttle services for
staff of the AA, government, tenants, licensees and franchisees
working at the airport.
</P>
<P>
HAS is expected to pour an initial investment of approximately

<HEADLINE> Philippine Lower House to Debate Charter Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives is scheduled to open debate Wednesday on whether
to turn the bicameral congress into a constituent assembly in
order to amend the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Pedro Romualdo, chairman of the House Committee on
Constitutional Amendments, said today he is ready to present
Wednesday the resolution on converting Congress to a constituent
assembly on the floor.
</P>
<P>
Romualdo, a principal proponent for the resolution, said he
will deliver a sponsorship speech to defend the bill Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Jose de Venecia, a proclaimed presidential
aspirant for the 1998 elections, said today that he had started a
series of caucus among the ruling party's congress group to get
their pulse on the resolution.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference this afternoon, de Venecia, general
secretary of the ruling Lakas-NUCD Party, disclosed that he had
already met with the party's Visayan bloc Monday night.
</P>
<P>
He said that a majority of the party's congressmen from the
Visayas region are in favor of the approval of House Concurrent
Resolution 40 on the creation of a constituent assembly.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the battlefield for changing the 1987
constitution moved to Congress as the supporters of President
Fidel Ramos in the legislative body pushed hard for opening a
debate on the charter change issue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the country's Commission on Election rejected a
petition by Ramos' supporters to verify millions of signatures
they gathered for holding a referendum to amend the charter.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' supporters have sought to rewrite the country's 1987
constitution to lift term limits of all government elective
officials including Ramos before the May 1998 presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, about 138 of the 220 congressmen, including those
from the opposition, will vote for convening Congress into a
constituent assembly since many of them can also extend their
terms of office by changing the charter.
</P>
<P>
But the resolution is expected to meet strong opposition in the
Senate, where the opposition camp enjoyed an overwhelming
majority, after it is carried by the lower house.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Ernesto Maceda, chief of the opposition
Nationalist People's Coalition party, expressed his confidence
today that Resolution 40 will be easily killed since at least 17
of the 24 senate members are expected to vote against it.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Economists of Standard Charted
Bank, one of the three note-issuing banks in Hong Kong, forecast
a 6.5 percent GDP growth for Hong Kong this year, higher than the
general prediction of about 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The August issue of the bank's "Greater China Viewpoints" says
that economic growth in the first half of 1997 should be higher
than six percent and prospects for the second half remain good.
</P>
<P>
Growth in consumption is picking up and investment is gaining
momentum in Hong Kong, reflecting strong confidence on the
economy, according to the monthly report. Optimism about Hong
Kong's economic prospects partly comes from the view that China's
economy will continue to do well.
</P>
<P>
The report also predicts that major stock market corrections
are unlikely to affect the overall performance of Hong Kong's
economy.
</P>
<P>
As to concern that the currency turmoil in Southeast Asia might
spill over to Hong Kong, the bank's report says that confidence
in Hong Kong dollar remains strong and speculators will find it
very difficult to undermine confidence in the local currency.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Reactor Construction in DPRK Possibly Takes More Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Construction of two light-water
nuclear reactors in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
originally set for completion in 2003, will take at least two
years longer, said the president of the project's prime contractor
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Establishing a nuclear reactor requires at least 95 months -
even if construction goes favorably - while it takes at least 107
months to build two reactors using advanced South Korean
techniques," said Rieh Chong-hun, president of the state-run South
Korean Electric Company.
</P>
<P>
Under a DPRK-U.S. accord, the U.S.-led multinational consortium
of Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) will
provide the two units of pressurized water reactors, in exchange
for DPRK's freezing its own nuclear program which is more capable
of producing weapon-grade plutonium.
</P>
<P>
"If we get main orders to build the 1,000-megawatt nuclear
reactors in January next year, we could finish building the first
reactor in 2005, while the second one will be completed by 2006,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The groundbreaking ceremony for the main construction is
expected to be held next year, said Rieh, who returned to Seoul
after attending a ceremony marking the start of construction of
basic facilities in Sinpo, DPRK, on August 19.

position of honorary president of the party when he retires from
the leadership.
</P>
<P>
The opposition National Party has decided to recommend a

<HEADLINE> UNDP Report Stresses Critical Role of Energy in Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- UNDP released a report entitled
"Energy After Rio: Prospects and Challenges" here today, which
discusses energy's critical link to poverty and development.
</P>
<P>
"Energy is directly related to the most pressing social issues
which affect sustainable development", says the report.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this report can serve to highlight the critical
importance of energy to sustainable development and the reality
that current patterns of energy production and use in most
countries of the world are unsustainable", says Arthur N. Holcome,
UNDP Resident Representative in China, at today's press conference.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that more than 1.5 billion people today lack
access to electricity, and tow billion people use traditional
fuels such as firewood and animal dung for cooking.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the heavy dependence on imported
fossil fuels has led to foreign debt problems in the developing
world. Investments in alternative energy technologies that require
lower expenditures of foreign exchange earnings would release
capital for other development needs.
</P>
<P>
The report says that increased access to energy is essential
to providing improved health care, education, housing, water and
sanitation services for people living in poverty. In particular,
women will benefit from modern energy.
</P>
<P>
Recent technological advances offer great prospects for
developing sustainable energy systems and developing countries
today have the opportunity to leapfrog to modern technologies, the
report states.
</P>
<P>
Annual energy investment requirements worldwide are projected
to rise to 750 billion US dollars by 2020, up from 450 billion US
dollars in the mid-1990s. Renewable and higher efficiency energy
systems would enable developing countries to meet growing needs at
a lower cost, says the report.

<HEADLINE> Georgian Parliamentary Official Stresses Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIBILISI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Georgian parliamentary
official said today the visit by a delegation of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC) promoted understanding between
the two countries' parliaments and boosted overall bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Eldar Shengelaia, deputy speaker of the National Assembly
(parliament) of Georgia, made the remarks as he saw the Chinese
NPC delegation off at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Shengelaia said that relations between Georgia and China have
developed rapidly since they established diplomatic ties in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Frequent contacts between leaders of the two countries had
established a good basis for bilateral ties and Georgia had had
great support from China since it declared independence in 1991,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the achievements China made in its reform and opening
up, adding Georgia can learn a lot from China's success.
</P>
<P>
Shengelaia said China's successful resumption of the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong has also set a very good example for
Georgia in solving similar problems.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, led by Vice-Chairman of the NPC
Standing Committee Wang Bingqian, visited the Transcaucasus
country from August 21-25. The delegation met with Georgian
President Eduard Shervardnadze and Speaker of the National
Assembly of Georgia Zurab Zhvaniya.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts Predict Booming State Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Professor Huang Da, a
well-known Chinese economist, claims that the time has come for
the state economy to rid itself of loss-making state-owned
enterprises due to the rapid growth of non-state economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the ongoing Ninth Annual PACAP Finance
Conference, Huang, chairman of China Financial Institute, said
that non-state sectors have played a balancing role in China's
national economy, a role somewhat different than that of the state
sector.
</P>
<P>
"This has created a rare opportunity for state-owned
enterprises to cast aside their embarrassing record of economic
performance," said Huang.
</P>
<P>
The increasing pressure China is facing both at home and abroad
is driving the country to accelerate financial reform.
</P>
<P>
"However, China should 'not act in haste,' but should instead
follow its own approach in reforming the state sector, rather than
simply copying the international practice, said Huang.
</P>
<P>
He said that appropriate attention should be placed on
reexamining the role state-owned enterprises play in the national
economy, and China must properly handle the relationships between
reform, development, and stability of the financial market.
</P>
<P>
Huang pointed out that state-owned enterprises have become de
facto "taxpayers" shouldering the heavy costs of the nation's
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
He praised the state-owned enterprises for their shouldering
the responsibility of ensuring social stability. This, he added,
has laid a solid foundation for the rapid development of national
economy.
</P>
<P>
He urged non-state sectors to pay for the country's development
along with the state-owned sector.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Helping Iran With Missile Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia has categorically denied
media reports that it is helping Iran develop ballistic missiles,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli television on Sunday alleged that Russia had been
helping Iran develop guidance and delivery systems for long-range
missiles and had provided Iran with the know-how to make warheads.
</P>
<P>
The television also said hundreds of Russian scientists were
working on the Iranian project.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that U.S. State Department spokesman James
Rubin said that Washington was taking the reports of Russian aid
for Iranian missile programs "very seriously".
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying
Tuesday that Russia has "provided the Americans and the Israelis
with numerous explanations on this issue".
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov a strongly-worded message last Thursday
protesting Russia's alleged missile cooperation with the Islamic
republic.
</P>
<P>
The press service of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service
said reports of Russian involvement in the Iranian missile program
were "absolutely groundless".
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu last Friday called a cabinet meeting, which proposed
freezing major economic cooperation projects with Russia, such as
the import of Russian natural gas, if Moscow continued to help
Iran develop the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Iran in April signed an agreement on export
restrictions which the Russian Foreign Ministry described as
"confirmation that both nations are committed to the norms of the
nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of
delivery."

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Deploy Warplanes in Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States will deploy
some warplanes in Bahrain in the next few months, Bahrain's
Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The Bahrain News Agency quoted the ministry said saying in a
statement that Bahrain has granted the U.S. to deploy "a team of
planes" in the Gulf island state.
</P>
<P>
The deployment will begin from September 19 and last till
October 20, the statement said, adding it came within the
framework of a U.S.-Bahraini defense treaty singed after the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The statement gave no further details about the coming
deployment, but western diplomats here said the movement is part
of U.S. efforts to support NATO's Operation Southern Watch, which
was launched to uphold international sanctions imposed on Iraq
since Iraqi invasion against Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
They also said the planes are likely from the U.S. Air
Expeditionary Force (AEF), a light and lean package of aircraft
and personnel designed to deploy to a forward location and
immediately employ combat assets.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for the U.S. to deploy warplanes
in the Gulf region this year. The U.S. made the first one
in Qatar during the period from February 30 to May 20 when
some 30 fighters and more than 1,000 airmen were sent there.

NANJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Four companies from different
industrial sectors in east China's Jiangsu Province are planning
to improve market competitiveness by consolidating into one
petrochemical enterprise group.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo attended today's preliminary
organizational meeting.
</P>
<P>
The planned Petrochemical Industries Group will consist of the
top four petrochemical companies in Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The four enterprises have established close cooperative
relations and the consolidation will ensure improved efficiency
and better use of assets. Wu noted that the State Council has
approved establishment of the group
</P>
<P>
The new group will have total assets of 45 billion yuan and
annual sales of 33 billion yuan, will become the nation's leading
producer of oil products, chemical fertilizer, and polyester
products. It will also be the country's largest base for
petroleum, chemicals, fertilizer, and chemical fiber.
</P>
<P>
The form of establishing larger and stronger enterprise groups
will help improve China's economic structure and improve the
distribution of resources, said Wu, adding that the practice
should be gradually expanded, rather than rushing headlong into

<HEADLINE> UN to Reduce Budget for Palestinian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 7 million U.S. dollars used
for the social welfare of Palestinian refugees will be chopped
from the 1997 budget of the United Nations Relief and Works
BDH231WSB017S26PEQL22:0922:101322
Agency (UNRWA), a Lebanese newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Start quoted Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz
as saying that the reason is the lack of contributions from donor
nations.
</P>
<P>
The director of UNRWA in Lebanon, Lionel Brisson, delivered
a letter Monday to Boueiz, informing him of the reduction in
this year's budget of 54.7 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz criticized the timing of the decrease in the UNRWA
budget, saying it was an attempt to pressure Lebanon into
accepting certain conditions for peace.
</P>
<P>
"The donor countries have decided to cut back on their
funding. This will have serious repercussions on the education
and medical coverage of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon,"
Boueiz said at a news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
The UNRWA was set up in 1950 to care for the social welfare
of the Palestinians in refugee camps. Of the 3.3 million
Palestinian refugees depending on the agency's aid, 360,000
reside in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The refugees in Lebanon are classified as "temporary
residents" and do not benefit from government services. They
rely largely on the UNRWA for schooling, health care and
camp infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz insisted that the plight of the Palestinian refugees
was the responsibility of the international community and should
not be shouldered solely by the host countries.

<HEADLINE> New Model of Using Tobacco Tax to Control Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- An Australian organization today
urged all countries in the world to consider a new model of using
tobacco tax in health promotion and smoking control.
</P>
<P>
The model, created by the Australian Victorian Health Promotion
Foundation (VicHealth), can help governments to secure long-term
funding for smoking control from a tobacco tax without claiming
funds from the general health budget, the 10th World Conference on
Tobacco or Health was told in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
"Taxing tobacco, which increases the price of cigarettes, is in
itself a disincentive for many people to continue smoking and for
young people to take up smoking," Ms Rhonda Galbally, Chief
Executive-Officer of VicHealth explained.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, using tobacco tax in tobacco control can help many
countries to settle the problem of fund shortage in health
promotion programs," she added.
</P>
<P>
The model has already produced positive effect on people's
health in Australia, and many countries have followed suit to
apply the model in one form or another, she said.
</P>
<P>
"China, the biggest tobacco producer and consumer in the world,
may make a good reference out of the model," said Cai Renhua,
Director of the Health Policy and Law Department of the Chinese
Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry has been a major source for China's
revenue since 1987. It turned out 83 billion yuan (about 10
billion US dollars) in revenue in 1996, five times that of 1986,
according to a report from the Chinese Academy of Preventive
Medicine (CAPM).
</P>
<P>
The medical expenses on tobacco-related diseases accounted for
13 percent of the total in China in 1993, said Prof. Jin Shuigao
from the CAPM during a symposia of the conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the direct expenses on tobacco throughout the
country are estimated to double for every 3.5 years during the
1989-2000 period.

<HEADLINE> Bundesbank Leaves Repurchase Rate Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The German central bank decided
today to leave its weekly securities repurchase rate unchanged at
3.0 percent despite earlier projections of rising inflation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Speculations about a rate hike by the Bundesbank gained force
on Monday after the German federal statistics office in Wiesbaden
warned that the inflation rate in western Germany would top 2.0
percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Although many analysts in Frankfurt predicted that the
Bundesbank might move to raise the repurchase rate a little bit in
the near future, they also agreed that the current weakness of the
U.S. dollar against the German mark had apparently given the
Bundesbank some reasons to take a wait-and-see attitude for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
A rate hike by the Bundesbank carries the risk of choking the
much-needed economic growth in Germany and undermine the
government's efforts to reduce record unemployment of over 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, the German umbrella group of
chambers of commerce DIHT today called on the government to curb
public spendings as a means of easing inflationary pressures in
the economy.
</P>
<P>
DIHT chief economist Guenter Albrecht told the German Saar
Radio that he hoped inflation could be held below 2 percent, since
a rise in inflation rates "would not be good for the economy".

BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang
Chunyun has urged various localities to earnestly summarize their
experience in fighting disasters and accelerate the construction
of water conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), conducted a
agricultural fact-finding tour in northeast China's Jilin Province
between August 22-26, and attended a Changchun agricultural

</P>
<P>
The vice-premier surveyed the production of farm crops,
inspected a group of pillar agricultural enterprises, and visited
village and rural households affected by the severe drought.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Jilin has suffered from a prolonged severe
drought this year. However, he noted that losses have been greatly
reduced due to the adoption of effective measures and strenuous
efforts of local authorities and people.
</P>
<P>
He urged various localities to place the highest priority on
processing and marketing agricultural products, and on

<HEADLINE> New Device Using Sounds Developed to Help Blind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have developed
a device using musical sounds to help blind people to find their
way around, The Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The researchers believe that blind or partially sighted people
can be trained to visualize scenes and objects such as houses and
trees if they are described in sound patterns, or "auditory
fingerprints".
</P>
<P>
The research team, which is supported by the Government's
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, is planning to
develop a prototype system called an optophone.
</P>
<P>
It will consist of a portable computer that can process images
into sounds, linked to glasses with in-built cameras and
headphones.
</P>
<P>
A team at Nene College, Northampton, led by Phil Picton, is
running the three- year project.
</P>
<P>
"The aim is to develop a prototype device capable of turning
moving images into sounds in real time," a spokesman for the
research council said.
</P>
<P>
Picton plans to use volunteers, some sighted and some visually
impaired, to test whether the brain can form pictures from sounds.
</P>
<P>
The optophone system is initially being developed to scan black
and white images. Picton has developed a computer software program
that translates the images into different harmonics.
</P>
<P>
The next stage is to see if the system can use sounds to
distinguish between the elements in moving color pictures. It is
hoped that objects will have their own sounds that can be learnt
and recognized by blind users.

<HEADLINE> Laos, Myanmar Agree to Visa Exemption for ASEAN Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 26 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Secretary-General
Ajit Singh said here today that Laos and Myanmar, the two new
members of the grouping, have agreed to introduce visa-free entry
for ASEAN nationals by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Both countries, which joined ASEAN (the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) last month, gave the commitment at the
Second Meeting of ASEAN Heads of Immigration Department, Ajit
Singh told reporters after the conclusion of the two-day meeting
here.
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam, which joined ASEAN in 1995, said they'll have to look
into some technical and administrative matters, but they have
assured us that they too will try to meet this deadline," the
ASEAN chief said.
</P>
<P>
Visas are not required currently in the other six ASEAN members
-- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and
Thailand -- for a length of stay of one month.
</P>
<P>
Ajit Singh said on the establishment of ASEAN lanes at
international airports of ASEAN members, Laos and the Philippines
agreed to implement immediately.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar introduced the system just before its officials came to
Kuala Lumpur to attend the meeting while Malaysia would see its
ASEAN lanes at the new Kuala Lumpur International Airport in
Sepang when it commences commercial operations in the first
quarter of next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Brunei and Singapore will also look into the matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Indonesia have already established the lanes in
their airports.
</P>
<P>
Such lanes will speed up immigration clearance for ASEAN
nationals visiting a member country, Ajit Singh said.
</P>
<P>
On the proposal to introduce smart cards to facilitate
intra-ASEAN travel, Ajit Singh said the meeting agreed to set up
a technical working group led by Indonesia to study the matter.
</P>
<P>
He said the group was also tasked to look into the
standardization of immigration disembarkation cards especially in
light of the smart-card proposal.
</P>
<P>
He said the older six ASEAN members also agreed to help train
immigration officers from Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam with funding
from the Jakarta-based ASEAN Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting of ASEAN immigration and consular division
chiefs will be held in Myanmar.

<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Puge Yi Nationality Autonomous
County, western Sichuan Province, joined the national
program-controlled telephone network today, becoming the last
county in the nation to do so.
</P>
<P>
China currently has more than 100 million program-controlled
telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
The achievement has established a major milestone in the
development of Chinese telecommunications construction, said Wu
Jichuan, minister of posts and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
During an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency, Wu said
that China's telecommunications sector can no longer be
categorized as a bottleneck industry, and that the sector's
development has "appropriately surpassed that of national economic
development."
</P>
<P>
The expansion of China's telephone network, developed at a rate
rarely seen in the world, has created the second largest such
network in the world, following the United States, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
China's telephone network capacity jumped from less than 15
million telephones at the end of 1991 to more than 100 million
telephones last year.
</P>
<P>
"The capacity does not as yet include Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan," according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
As late as 1978, nearly 300 Chinese citizens shared a
telephone, with the current figure standing at 22 phones per 300
people. In cities, however, the rate stands at one phone per four
people.

All Chinese provincial capitals have at least seven digit phone
numbers, with eight digits used in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Chongqing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Wu projected that China will increase its program-controlled
switchboard capacity to 174 million telephones by the end of the
century, with one in ten people owning a telephone.
</P>
<P>
The country's mobile telephone network has developed at an
annual rate of 149 percent over the past five years, with the rate
far exceeding that for regular telephones, Wu pointed out that
some 10.26 million people currently own mobile telephones.
</P>
<P>
"Mobile telecommunications has emerged as a new growth area for
China's telecommunications industry," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
China's analogue mobile telecom network covers all county-level
cities and a number of towns. In addition, the nation's digital
mobile phone network not only covers the entire country, but also
has linked to networks in France, Germany, Australia, Singapore
and eight other countries.
</P>
<P>
China plans to develop automatic roaming services with six
countries, including Spain, Turkey, Finland and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Wu also pointed to the great progress in the technological
development of the telecom industry over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
More than half of program-controlled switchboards used in China
are produced domestically, including some 87 percent of
program-controlled switchboards added in 1996.
</P>
<P>
China has developed a network which includes a primary cable
network and subsidiary digital microwave and satellite systems.
</P>
<P>
"Completion of the Lanzhou-Xining-Lhasa cable network next year
will link China's trunk cable network to the 'roof of the world',"
according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
China plans to build a nationwide telecommunications grid by
the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Wu summarized the past five years of development by saying:
"China's telecom industry has without a doubt witnessed the most
rapid and dynamic period of development in history."
</P>
<P>
China's posts and telecommunications business volume grew by an
annual rate of 45.6 percent during the 1992-1996 period.

<HEADLINE> New Safety Techniques Used for Australian-Made Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian car producer Holden
said today that it has developed and introduced benchmark
techniques that could provide better safety protection for car
occupants.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of Holden's new model VT Commodore in
Sydney, Laurie Sparke, the company's safety expert, said "two
significant new technologies have been developed and applied for
the first time, achieving better crash energy management and
improved protection through a sophisticated restraint system."
</P>
<P>
A key to the car's safety performance was the
computer-optimized restraint system, which links driver and
passenger airbags with the seat belt webbing clamps and
pyrotechnic pretensioners.
</P>
<P>
Using a new computer program, Holden simulated 100,000 crashes
with various combination of occupants, safety features and crash
circumstances, something that was not possible before, Sparke
said.
</P>
<P>
The expert said the second major safety breakthrough on the VT
was the introduction of new frame design which allowed the front
end of the new Commodore to crush in a more progressive manner,
absorbing more crash energy.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Minister on Reform, Economic Construction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved great success
in reform and economic construction since the 14th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in October 1992,
Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission,
said today.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remark while delivering a report on China's
achievements in reform and economic construction organized by
five central departments.
</P>
<P>
China entered a new round of high economic growth during the
past three year, which featured far-reaching profound
changes. Rapid economic growth has enabled China to attain the
strategic goal of quadrupling the 1980 gross national product
(GNP) by the year 2000 five years ahead of schedule, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
China also made breakthroughs in establishing a socialist
market economic structure, formed a multi-tier all-dimensional
pattern of opening up, scored notable achievements in
improving the living standards of the people, and recorded
tremendous changes in rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995) represented the
period with most rapid growth and the smallest fluctuations since
the founding of New China in 1949, according to Chen.

<P>
Chen added that that successful implementation of the Eighth
Five-Year Plan laid a solid foundation for drawing up the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and the program for the long-term
objective through the year of 2010.
</P>
<P>
So far, China's economy has achieved a "soft landing", thereby
demonstrating a fine development momentum characterized by "high
growth and low inflation".
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that rapid development over the past five
years has led to historical changes in China's economic life, with
the market force playing an increasingly important role in the
resources distribution.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between supply and demand has changed greatly
over the years. Supply and demand have either remained in balance,
or the the former has exceeded the latter for the majority of
commodities. This in turn has led to the appearance of a buyer's
market, accompanied by the disappearance of long-standing
phenomena such as standing in queues to purchase commodities and
rationing.
</P>
<P>
Changes have also taken place in the relationship between
industry and agriculture, with a reversal in the one-way situation
in which the latter provided the former with accumulation. Today,
the industrial sector also provides aid to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Successes in economic construction, reform and opening since
the 14th congress prove that the the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee headed by Jiang Zemin has the full ability to
administer the country effectively, skillfully control the
macro-economy and handle complicated issues, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
The minister also stressed the need to become sober-minded in
solving a number of evident problems cropping up in current social
and economic life.

<HEADLINE> Big Strides Reported in Meteorological Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China has made remarkable
progress in meteorological science which plays a significant role
in preventing and combating nature disasters.
</P>
<P>
Reporting to the ongoing 27th Standing Committee Meeting of
the National People's Congress here today, Director of National
Meteorological Bureau Wen Kegang said that China now has a
comprehensive meteorological monitoring system, with about 2,600
meteorological stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
The national and regional meteorological centers are
computerized, and meteorological stations at provincial and city
levels can make short and middle-term weather forecasts with
rather high accuracy.
</P>
<P>
"China leads the developing countries in the meteorological
technology and in some aspects is catching up with that of the
world developed countries in the 1990s," Wen told the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, China is relatively weak in climate monitoring
and forecasts, especially in short-term climate
forecasts. Climate-related natural disasters have caused the country
a loss of grain output averaging 15 billion kilograms per year.
</P>
<P>
Wen pledged to enhance climate research and meanwhile increase
investment in meteorological satellites development projects and
its application technology.

<P>
LUANDA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The consumer price index (CPI)
in Angola's capital Luanda rose by 12.9 percent in the first
seven months this year, according to a press communique released
here today by Angola's National Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the CPI increased by 1.35 percent in

209,000 against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
It said that the CPI in the capital registered a 112.6 percent
rise during the period from July 1996 to July this year.
</P>
<P>
One third of the Angolan habitants live in the capital region.
Therefore, the changes of the CPI in this region is a barametor
reflecting the prices in the whole market of Angola.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Examine Draft Price Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China's draft Price Law
submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress on Monday has triggered lively discussion amongst
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Members of the NPC Standing Committee noted that a price law is
extremely necessary at a time when China is advancing towards its
market-oriented economy. Such a law, they pointed out, will not
only check illegal pricing activities, but will also promote price
reform.
</P>
<P>
A number of committee members said that a reasonable pricing
system not only touches the life of all people, but also has a
direct bearing on national economy and social stability. They
suggested "the use of reasonable pricing to create a fair
competitive environment" and "safeguard the legal rights of both
traders and consumers" should be written into the general
principles of the law.
</P>
<P>
The draft law stipulates three forms of pricing: prices
determined by market competition; government-set prices; and
prices subject to government guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Noted economist Dong Furen said the law should contain explicit
wording on government activities in order to eliminate
inappropriate official interference. For example, the scope of
government-set prices and prices subject to government guidelines
should be clearly defined.
</P>
<P>
According to Dong, the draft seems to allocate too much power
to price management departments, including a clause permitting
said departments to investigate the saving deposits of legal
entities and audit accounting records.
</P>
<P>
Dong cautioned that the law should define and restrict such
activities to ensure smooth operation of the market.
</P>
<P>
NPC Standing Committee members criticised irregularities in
pricing system and suggested that the law underscore the
protection of consumers interests and include articles preventing
excessive profit-making activities.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Malaysian

the country gained independence and later when the Look East
Policy was formulated 15 years ago, the government began to send
students to Japan to study in various fields.
</P>
<P>
"It was a success and I feel that we should continue this
tradition and perhaps enhance it by closer collaboration between

<HEADLINE> Passive Smokers Suffer from Serious Hazards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The latest survey shows that
second-hand "smoking" is closely related to the incidence of heart
diseases and lung cancer and can seriously damage children's
health.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 10th World Conference on Tobacco or Health,
Dr. Stanton Glantz from the University of California said that a
large number of epidemiological studies showed that an increase of
around 30 percent in the risk of cardio-vascular diseases were
related with being married to a smoker.
</P>
<P>
He said that second-hand smoke exposure can first cause damage
to the cardio-vascular system, which results in about 50,000 to
60,000 annual deaths in the United States.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 surveys, carried out in China, Japan, the United
States, Greek, Britain, Sweden and Russia also found that lifelong
nonsmoking women, living with a smoking spouse, have an estimated
35 percent increase in the risk of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
The surveys also revealed that in western countries, about 20
to 30 percent of lung cancer cases among nonsmokers are caused by
environmental smoking (ETS).
</P>
<P>
A recent report of the US Environmental Protection Agency said
ETS is responsible for at least 3,000 cases of lung cancer death
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Samet from the Johns Hopkins University said that
fetal exposure through maternal smoking is associated with
increased rates of spontaneous abortion and prenatal mortality,
and can reduce infants' birth weight. It could also have lasting
adverse effect on children's growth.
</P>
<P>
He said the involuntary smoking after birth can hinder the
growth of lung during childhood and raise the incidence of
respiratory diseases among children.
</P>
<P>
Parental smoking is also one of the causes for asthma, the most
common chronic disease of childhood, according to the latest
information.
</P>
<P>
Samet noted that the prevention of children's diseases from
passive smoking should focus on the home, while schools are also
required to be smoke-free, and the teachers, not smoke in front of
their students.

</P>
<P>
She also expressed her satisfaction with the achievement of the

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals to Macao Drop 4.72 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals to Macao dropped
4.72 percent in the first six months of this year from the same
1996 period, latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and statistics Department
show that the number of tourists coming to Macao between January
and June reached 3.76 million, a decrease of more than 180,000
from the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The number of Hong Kong visitors, the dominant source of
tourists to Macao, declined by the largest margin of 14.28
percent. That translates to more than 375,000 travelers.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists from Southeast Asian nations also
dropped. In particular, over 20 percent fewer Singaporeans visited
 Macao in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tourist arrivals from Taiwan soared by more than
180,000, to reach 485,300, up 60.29 percent. The number of
tourists from China's inland areas rose 11.3 percent, and tourist
arrivals from Europe also grew 16.22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the increase of Taiwanese tourists to Macao
is mainly the result of the quasi-direct flights across the Taiwan
Straits. Many Taiwanese tourists and businessmen like to fly to
inland areas via Macao.
</P>
<P>
However, they say that the rising triad-related crimes in Macao
over the past few months have frightened away tourists. But for
the increase of Taiwanese travelers, the number of tourists would
have dropped further.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is a leading source of income for the tiny territory of
some 420,000 residents. The tourism sector and casinos contribute
about half of local revenues.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists to Macao reached 8.15 million last
year.

PRETORIA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- United Nations special envoy
Jamsheed Marker said here today that South African president
Nelson Mandela's role in the East Timorese conflict had boosted
peace efforts in that region.
</P>
<P>
"Your contribution has been both timely and important. It has
given great impetus to our work in the U.N.," Marker said after
meeting Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Marker, special envoy for East Timor, said the U.N. would
maintain close contact with South Africa in its bid to broker a
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Marker arrived here today for a short visit on the invitation
of Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he had briefed Marker on his recent talks with
jailed East Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao, Indonesian
president Suharto, and other leading figures involved.
</P>
<P>
Mandela met Gusmao in Jakarta last month during an official
visit to Indonesia. The talks were arranged with the blessing of
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
Mandela called for the release of Gusmao in July, saying all
political leaders in East Timor "had to be free to normalise the
situation".
</P>
<P>
He told reporters today that he had not yet received any
direct response to his appeal. He said his initiatives were in
support of U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan's strive to promote
international peace.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said Annan has sent Marker to get a direct report from
him on this effort.
</P>
<P>
Gusmao is the leader of East Timorese independent movement. He
was captured in 1992 by Indonesian government and sentenced to 20
years in prison.

FRANKFURT, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's UBS bank
announced here today that it is taking over majority ownership of
a German private bank from Britain's banking group Lloyds TSB for
about 193 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Lloyds TSB is transferring its entire holding

The Frankfurt-based SMH, which recently switched strategy to
concentrate on investment, was formed in 1969 in a merger of three
German private banks and was bought by the British bank in 1984.

The Lloyds TSB said it had decided on the deal because the SMH
no longer fit in with its overall business strategy.

The UBS meanwhile said the acquisition was intended to boost
its own position in Germany, the largest continental European
financial market.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Manufacturing Industry Hit by Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's manufacturing industry
is facing a dim prospect because of smuggled goods and subsidized
imports, Financial Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(ZACCI) warned in its 1997 economic report for the second quarter
that "unless government puts in place anti-dumping duties or
safeguard measures to protect local industry, the country will be
faced with prospects of de-industrialization."
</P>
<P>
ZACCI said dumping cases are very prominent, particularly,
with regard to imported tyres, batteries and other goods that
should push government into putting corrective measures in place
before it is too late.
</P>
<P>
It noted in the report that ZACCI and the Zambia Association
of Manufacturers should double their efforts in reviving the "buy
Zambian" campaign.
</P>
<P>
It said that although the campaign is costly, it will be worth
spending whatever amounts there is as this will benefit the
industry and the country.
</P>
<P>
Last year the sector grew by about 2.5 percent and contributed
almost 29 percent of the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of
Zambia.

HONG KONG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Post Office will
launch a new service later this year which will allow businesses to

<HEADLINE> China Reports Rapid Growth In Foreign Trade (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade has
recovered from last year's slump, with 96.4 billion US dollars
worth of exports in the first seven months of the year, a 26
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The country expects to handle a total of 400 billion US dollars
in imports and exports annually by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The country suffered a drop in exports last year, and reported
an increase of only 1.5 percent for the whole of 1996, the lowest
since the reform and opening-up drive began in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade expert Li Yushi attributes the recovery to
timely export rebates and stable prices on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Last year, there was 30 billion yuan in refunds for
export-oriented enterprises, greatly helping improve their
financial situation.
</P>
<P>
Successful macro-economic controls also helped stabilize
prices, lowering the cost of exports and increasing
competitiveness of commodities.
</P>
<P>
But to increase foreign trade, a greater effort must be made to
improve the product mix, because some enterprises are running at
a loss, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China has had a shift in the export structure from primary
products to manufactured goods, which now account for nearly 85
percent of exports. But a further goal is to develop value-added
products to get a larger market share, and priority has been
placed on electronics products and machinery. China has advantages
in this area, especially in generators, and cement and chemical
industry equipment.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the first seven months of the year, China had slightly over
30 billion US dollars worth of machinery and electronics exports,
a rise of 24.6 percent, thanks to the government support in loans
and tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
Higher productivity is the key to steady growth in exports, Li
explained, adding that more must be done to import high-quality
raw materials, machinery, and technology to improve the quality of
Chinese products.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, China has had a rapid increase in
imports of technology and equipment, and imported 230 billion US
dollars worth of machinery and transport equipment.
</P>
<P>
Imports of nuclear power equipment, program-controlled
telephone exchanges, and electronics goods began to increase, and
priority was given to such industries as energy,petrochemicals,
machinery and electronics.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 5,000 enterprises with the right to
independently handle foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan, and Europe remain China's major trade
partners, but the foreign trade sector is making an effort to
develop new markets in West Asia, North Africa, and Latin
America.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's External Debt Service Ratio Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's external debt service
ratio has dropped to 22 percent of its total export earnings
reflecting an increase in export earnings and the benefits the
country is drawing from both the multilateral and bilateral
donors.
</P>
<P>
In 1995-1996, the claim of external debt services on export
earnings was 32 percent, according to statistics of the finance
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of the debt services reflects an expected 10
percent increase in export earnings as well as the declining
trend of the country's debt service payments.
</P>
<P>
In absolute terms, therefore, its net external debt services
come down from 377 million U.S. dollars in 1995 to an expected
259 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
But debt services, both external and domestic, have been the
major consumer of the foreign exchange earnings of Zambia in the
first six months of this year as 53 percent of its total inflows
of about 132 million dollars went to service the debts.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Bank of Zambia, during the
first quarter, foreign exchange outflows from the central bank
amounted to 72.133 million dollars of which 42.275 million
dollars went to service government debts.
</P>
<P>
The central bank released only 6.9 million dollars on to the
open market and used 11.524 million dollars on other government
uses while non governmentt users consumed 11.22 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both the inflows and outflows increased further by the end of
June that resulted in the recorded surplus.
</P>
<P>
This has been attributed to the reduction in debt service
ratio following the good performance of the country on the
macroeconomic level and under its structural adjustment program.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- South African opposition
National Party leader FW de Klerk will announce resignation from
his position and departure from politics today, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted the Cape Town Africans Daily Die Burger as
reporting that De Klerk had informed his deputy leaders in nine
provinces that he would formally resign Tuesday to make place for
a new party leader.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk had not given full reasons for the step, and the nine
leaders had been caught by surprise, the report said.
</P>
<P>
For now, De Klerk spokesman Fanus Schoeman declined to confirm
the report.
</P>
<P>
Although De Klerk has not yet announced his resignation,
leaders of South African parties have voiced their comments over
the matter.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela said in Pretoria today
that he hoped South Africa would remember the role De Klerk had
played in bringing about a peaceful political transformation in
the country.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever mistakes he may have made...I hope South Africa will
not forget the role he has played," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party leader Tony Leon also expressed that outgoing
National Party leader De Klerk would and should be remembered for
the February 2, 1990 speech, in which he announced Mandela's
release and the unbanning of political organizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Brunei today
agreed to hold a regular meeting between the heads of the two
governments every year to discuss bilateral ties and cooperation
at the macro level.
</P>
<P>
This was the outcome of the bilateral meeting here today
between Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei, who is also prime
minister, and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysian
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told reporters after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders acknowledged the benefits of a regular meeting
and agreed that both countries take turns in hosting it and the
meeting next year will be held in Brunei's capital Bandar Sri
Begawan, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
Although Malaysia and Brunei do not have any major bilateral
problems, the two leaders felt that regular meetings between
senior officials, ministers and heads of government of the two
countries would further boost understanding and relations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"With this, it will be easier for us to deal with any matter
concerning bilateral ties between Malaysia and Brunei. If such a
spirit is not there... it will be more difficult," the foreign

minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysia-Brunei Joint Commission will continue to

relation to the decisions reached at the meetings between their
leaders.

Abdullah said Mahathir also informed the sultan of Malaysia's
stand on the speculative attacks on the currencies of Malaysia and
several other ASEAN members.

Mahathir said he would express Malaysia's and several other
countries' firm stand on such "criminal acts" at the World
Bank-International Monetary Fund meetings in Hong Kong next month,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The prime ministers agreed to exchange information on similar
activities and to look for ways to jointly tackle the problem,
Abdullah said, adding Malaysia and Brunei also agreed on the need
for concerted efforts among the ASEAN nations to tackle the
problem.

men.''

Third Reich who is now 95 years old, had for the first time since
the end of the war her pictures displayed in a small exhibition in

from the film she shot at the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games and some
pictures she took in Sudan, had aroused a controversy in Germany.

played during World War II and Nazi Gold, the Swiss city Basle today
began to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Zionism in
the city, where Theodor Herzle, the founding father of modern
Zionism, declared that he founded the first Jewish state in Basle at

He said, "the government has made a commitment and will cut
other activities of the government to accommodate ex-combatants."

<HEADLINE> Labour Shortage Hits Zimbabwe's Tea Growers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The shortage of labour on tea
estates is growing in Zimbabwe despite efforts being made to
solve it through the introduction of machines, a local daily
paper, The Herald, reported today.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Highlands Plantations Limited, one of the country's
major tea and coffee producers said Monday the shortage of tea
plucking labour remained a major constraint to increased tea
production.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported tea and coffee estates and also cotton
growers were first hit by a labour shortage when hundreds of
Mozambicans who used to work on the farms were repatriated when
peace returned to their country.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to woo local labour has largely failed because of the
low wages offered by the farmers. Cotton growers have been quick
to introduce machines to pick the cotton but the quality of the
crop cannot match the hand-picked one which Zimbabwe has been
known to produce for decades.
</P>
<P>
This year, turnover for the tea and coffee producer rose by 56
percent due to improved quality of the tea and the better prices
on the market.

Kabila of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are expecting
comprehensive help from South Africa to rebuild his country's

</P>
<P>
Local daily, The Citizen, today quoted Kabila as saying that
the most pressing need in his country was to establish roads and

Referring to post-war reconstruction, Kabila also called on

generals and senior politicians who fled to South Africa after
the downfall of the Mobutu regime.
</P>
<P>
He accused them of using South Africa as a base to plot the
overthrow of the new-born DRC government, and suggest these people
have to go back home.
</P>
<P>
In response, Mandela said he had set up a team under Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo to look into the allegations, noting his
government did not want its country to be a base for
destabilizing any country.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela did not comment on the handover of the men
once loyal to ousted Mobutu.

NAIROBI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government intends
to introduce additional taxes and an anti-dumping duty in a move
to bridge the budget deficit gap widened by the International
Monetary Fund's key loan cut, local press reported today..

<P>
SHENYANG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China will spend 600 million
U.S. dollars combining onshore exploration with offshore oil
exploration at the Suizhong 36-1 oilfield in the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
The new exploration technique is suited to Suizhong 36-1, the

rights to use 970 mu (one mu equals to 0.0667 ha) of county land
and 1,170 m of coastline.
</P>
<P>
According to a Bohai Oil Company official, the company will
build a multi-purpose base for production and living with
facilities for oil and gas processing, storage, and marketing, and
a new oil berth.
</P>
<P>
Suizhong 36-1 was discovered in 1988 in Liaodong Bay, 70 km
from Suizhong Port. It covers 48 sq.km. and has proven reserves of
289 million tons of oil. It has produced two million tons of oil
and gas a year since the Bohai Oil Company began trial offshore
development in 1988 at a cost of 1.8 billion yuan, on a
6.55-sq. km. area.

(about 10,000 to 4,000 years ago) in a village in Baoding City in
north China's Hebei Province.
</P>

local archeology departments have unearthed a large number of
relics in the village that include animal and bird bones,
charcoal, plant seeds, pottery shards, and stone implements.

Experts here said the discovery of a millstone and pollen
indicate that rudimantary agriculture appeared about 10,000 years

reported the local daily, The New Vision, today.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Calls For Mutually Beneficial Cooperation With ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
today the cooperation between China and ASEAN countries should be
oriented toward the 21st century on the basis of mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
In a speech entitled "Strengthen Mutually Beneficial
Cooperation and Promote Common Prosperity", delivered to a group
of Singapore businessmen on the last day of his three-day visit,
Li said China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) countries need to expand areas of cooperation in order for
their respective strength to complement each other.
</P>
<P>
He said the economies of China and ASEAN countries, having
their respective features and advantages, are highly complementary
to each other.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides should, proceeding from their own actual
conditions, maximize their respective favorable factors and
minimize the unfavorable so as to complement each other with their
advantages and conduct mutually beneficial cooperation based on
equality with a view to seeking common development.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China and ASEAN countries also need to strengthen
coordination and cooperation in the financial field.
</P>
<P>
He said compared with the developed countries, "the economic
strength of countries and regions like ours" is still relatively
weak and the financial system is inadequate, which bears certain
financial risks and is susceptible to the impact of the turbulence
of the international financial market in the course of its
development.
</P>
<P>
He said China and ASEAN countries should increase their
coordination and cooperation in finance and step up exchanges of
information to keep each other informed so as to ward off
international financial speculation.
</P>
<P>
He added both sides should draw lessons from previous financial
crises in the world, keeping a high degree of vigilance,
strengthening financial regulation and improving the financial
system so as to forestall and reduce financial risks to the
minimum and ensure a sound growth of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China and ASEAN countries should take firm hold of
the converging point where they share extensive common interests
and lift the mutually beneficial cooperation onto a new high.
</P>
<P>
He said the mutually beneficial cooperation between China and
ASEAN countries is a long-term strategy with the future in mind
rather than an expediency.
</P>
<P>
He said the cooperation between the two sides, focused on the
whole world instead of merely the region, conduces not only to
their respective economic development, but also to peace and
stability of the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
He added that the mutually beneficial cooperation between China
and ASEAN countries, also serving as the foundation for political
diversity in the world, can be predicted to be more dynamic and
vibrant in the days ahead.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Stands Firm on U.S. Pressure for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is sticking firmly to
its own offers to financial liberalization under its commitment to
the World Trade Organization (WTO), as the United States presses
further on the matter before the WTO opens the next round of talks
on financial services in September.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi, governor of the Bank of Thailand, said
Monday that Thailand has opened its financial market sufficiently
and it will stand firm with its original offers.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has issued new bank licenses to foreign
banks recently and it also has allowed foreign banks to install
automatic teller machines (ATMs) and expand their branches in the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also has moved to relax its rules on the ceiling limit
for foreign holdings in local banks and finance firms and Thailand
will continue to do so on a case-by-case basis, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The governor reiterated that Thailand will not change its
offers it set originally.
</P>
<P>
Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jeffrey Lang made a trip to
Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, India
and Thailand to lobby before the WTO is scheduled to conclude a
global agreement on financial services liberalization on December
12 this year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his visit to Thailand Monday, the U.S. envoy
urged Thailand to improve its financial liberalization offers to
the WTO as a measure to restore investors' confidence in the Thai
economy.
</P>
<P>
The WTO talks present a further opportunity for Thailand to do
so, Lang said.
</P>
<P>
On the International Monetary Fund (IMF) standby arrangement
for Thailand, Lang said that the U.S. welcomes the IMF step to
support Thailand's stabilization program as a significant step
towards the restoration of financial stability.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that the U.S. is worrying that the
current currency turmoil in Southeast Asia might make some WTO
members block the efforts to open up the financial services
market.
</P>
<P>
Lang said that the U.S. will be flexible in working creatively
and constructively with countries to conclude a WTO financial
services agreement that can help address structural weakness and
reinforce market confidence where needed.
</P>
<P>
In response, Thai Commerce Minister Narongchai Akrasanee said
that the U.S. should adjust its role from an aggressor in
pressuring for the financial liberalization to a supporter to
assist smaller countries in maximizing the use of foreign capital,
as the country is believed to cause the current chaos in the world
financial market.
</P>
<P>
The WTO should draw a lesson from the current turmoil in
Southeast Asia as overexposure to foreign capital may lead to
disaster on financial markets in any country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO should assist members in improving their debt market
accounting and appraisal standards, otherwise exposure to foreign
capital through financial liberalization might cause problems for
some WTO members, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the current financial turmoil in
Thailand to an inadequate supervisory system, lack of a deep
foreign exchange market, heavy short-term debts and a substandard
assets evaluation system in the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. to use its expertise to help developing
countries prepare mechanisms to avoid a possible disaster from
overexposure to foreign capital inflow and outflow.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Revenue Collection Trails Behind Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The latest estimates show that
the revenue collection of Pakistan is trailing behind the
specified target, a local newspaper report said today.
</P>
<P>
The revenue collection during July, the first month of the
1997-98 fiscal year, was about 15.9 billion rupees (398 million
U.S. dollars) and the projected estimates for August showed just a
little improvement over the previous month, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The tax revenue target for the first quarter of the fiscal
year, July to September, is 65 billion rupees (1.63 billion
dollars) or 20 percent of the yearly target of 324 billion rupees
(8.1 billion dollars), according to the report.
</P>
<P>
That means July's revenue collection is 5.7 billion rupees (143
million dollars) short of the target.
</P>
<P>
As the revenue collection trends of August are not very
encouraging, said the report, there is every possibility that the
government may miss the quarterly revenue collection targets.
</P>
<P>
"On paper, the government has done everything fine, policies
are good and the intention is right, but implementation is not up
to the mark," the report quoted a senior economist as saying.
</P>
<P>
"After substantially reducing tax and tariff rates, the
government needs to squeeze out the due taxes from all the
sectors," the economist said.

<HEADLINE> Sampras, Seles Win First Round without Difficulty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Both men's and women's stars
Pete Sampras and Monic Seles got through their first round easily
with a stragight-set win recpectively in the U.S. Open tennis
championships Monday night.
</P>
<P>
American defending champion Sampras used only 94 minutes to
trounce Australian qualifier Todd Larkham 6-3, 6-1, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
"The first match of a slam is always one you just want to get
through," said the four-time titlist, who started to his 10th
U.S. Open campaign.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fourth seed Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia went out in
the first round for the third time in four years as the
semifinalist last year shocked 4-6, 7-5, 6-1, 7-6 by 91st-ranked
Romanian Dinu Pescariu.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot win matches when you play like that," said the
dejected Croat, who sprayed a whopping 75 unforced errors and
landed just 48 percent of his first serves in play.
</P>
<P>
In a somewhat lesser surprise, Todd Martin picked off his
countryman and world former number one Jim Courier of the United
States 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Martin was making his return after a six-month absence
following elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
Women's second seed and twice-champion Seles, who played the
first-ever match under the lights at the splendid new Arthur Ashe
Stadium, made just three unforced errors in the 22-minute first
set on her way to a 6-1, 6-2 thumping of Kristie Boogert of the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to have a pretty fast match out there," said
Seles, who is recovering from high fever and a throat virus that
forced her to pull out in the middle of the Atlanta tournament
last week.
</P>
<P>
Seles, runner-up to injured five-time champion Steffi Graf the
past two years, won back-to-back tournaments prior to pulling out
last week in Atlanta. But she was not ready to pronounce herself a
favorite for the 1997 title.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Urged to Increase Savings to Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian State Bank
Governor Ahmad Mohd Don today urged Malaysians to increase the
level of national savings to help stabilize the currency market
which is now affected by currency speculators' manipulation.
</P>
<P>
Although a lot of attention is being given to the movements of
the currency market which is not so stable right now, Malaysians
should work towards building the foundations towards greater
economic success for the nation and one of these would be a high
level of savings, he said at the opening of a seminar on
encouraging savings here.
</P>
<P>
With a high level of savings, he said, the country would be
able to achieve a high level of investment, and this development
would enable Malaysia to raise its productivity without having to
depend on foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
"If we are too dependent on foreign funds, we will face higher
risks and higher cost of funds, especially in a not very stable
market as is happening now," the governor said, adding that in
view of this, Malaysians need to raise their level of savings to
lessen those risks.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange market has become less stable following
speculative attacks by speculators which had caused Malaysian
ringgit (local currency) to fall.
</P>
<P>
The central bank chief said that in order to reduce the risks
from the instability of the currency market, savings in the
country ought to be expanded although Malaysia has one of the
highest savings rates in the world, which was 37.8 percent of the
gross national product last year.
</P>
<P>
"Although Malaysia had maintained the high savings rate over
the past three decades with an average of 28.6 percent between
1970 and 1996, we should not be satisfied with this achievement,"
Ahmad said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia still depended a lot on foreign funds for
investments, especially in the manufacturing sector which was
supposed to spearhead the nation's march towards developed nation
status under Vision 2020.
</P>
<P>
"The increased competition in attracting foreign investors as
well as the currency movements have revealed the necessity to
raise the level of savings so that economic growth is not
adversely affected in the future," he said.

<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange
(PSE) said today that it will hold a seminar on the trading and
management of warrants on August 29 in Pasig city, Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the newly created PSE Training Institute, the
one-day seminar is expected to further develop awareness and
proficiency in the trading of warrants as part of the PSE's
educational program for brokers.
</P>
<P>
As defined, warrants are financial contracts giving the right
but not the obligation to buy or sell specific shares at a fixed
price on or before a specific date.
</P>
<P>
PSE President Jose Luis Yulo is to make opening remarks at the
seminar and discuss with the participants the reason why the local
bourses are initiating the move to make the investors aware of how
warrants are being managed and traded at the exchange.
</P>
<P>
He said that stock exchanges in Southeast Asia are actively
trading warrants as the Philippines is only trading about four
warrants listed at the PSE.
</P>
<P>
The four warrants are being traded to serve only as a bonus to
the initial public offerings, stock rights and private placements,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Mountain Slopes in Guizhou Become Fertile Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 260,000 hectares of
mountainside have been transformed into terraced fields in
southwest China's Guizhou province in the past six years, using a
total investment of 140 million yuan (17 million US dollars)
provided by local farmers in 30 counties, in addition to
government allocations.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate farming, farmers have built mountain roads with
the total length reaching 947,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
As a result, during the past six years, the province's total
acreae of cultivated fields has increased by 33,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
Terracing sloped fields has raised the region's ability to
combat drought and brought in increased grain output. Corn output
per ha has gone up from 1,500 kg to 5,250 kg, and paddy rice from
3,000 kg to 6,750 kg.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers get 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars)
every year by planting economic crops in the terraced fields, such
as peanuts, chili peppers and watermelon.
</P>
<P>
Terracing in karst mountain areas is a successful way to end
poverty, improve farm conditions, increase grain output and
farmers' income, said Wu Yixia, governor of Guizhou province.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent decision by the province, 67,000 ha more
mountain slopes will be transformed into terraced fields annually
from now on. The provincial government is to provide 20 million
yuan (2.4 million US dollars) every year for the construction of
water conservation facilities.
</P>
<P>
The province is expected to build up 540,000 ha of farmland by
the year of 2000, Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Stands Firm on U.S. Pressure for Finance Liberalization by Xiong Ping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is sticking firmly to
its own offers to financial liberalization under its commitment to
the World Trade Organization (WTO), as the United States presses
further on the matter before the WTO is to open the next round of
talks on financial services in September.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi, governor of the Bank of Thailand, said
Monday that Thailand has opened its financial market sufficiently
and it will stand firm with its original offers and not offer
more.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has issued new bank licenses to foreign
banks recently and it also has allowed foreign banks to install
automatic teller machines (ATMs) and expand their branches in the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also has moved to relax its rules on the ceiling limit
for foreign holdings in local banks and finance firms and Thailand
will continue to do so on a case-by-case basis, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The governor reiterated that Thailand will not change its
offers it set originally.
</P>
<P>
Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jeffrey Lang made a trip to
Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, India
and Thailand to lobby before the WTO is scheduled to conclude a
global agreement on financial services liberalization on December
12 this year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his visit to Thailand Monday, the U.S. envoy
urged Thailand to improve its financial liberalization offers to
the WTO as a measure to restore investors' confidence in the Thai
economy.
</P>
<P>
The WTO talks present a further opportunity for Thailand to do
so, Lang said.
</P>
<P>
On the International Monetary Fund (IMF) standby arrangement
for Thailand, Lang said that the U.S. welcomes the IMF step to
support Thailand's stabilization program as a significant step
towards the restoration of financial stability.

<HEADLINE> India's Foreign Investment Approvals Shoot Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- There has been an unusual
surge in foreign direct investment (FDI) approvals in India in the
first five months of this year, the Economic Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the FDI approvals reached a record high of
7.45 billion U.S. dollars against a total of 10.34 billion
approved in 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Going at this rate, it should exceed the figure of 15 billion
U.S. dollars before the end of 1997," the newspaper quoted
government sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The total approvals of FDI in both 1995 and 1996 were about 10
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The actual inflow in U.S. dollar terms in the first five months
of this year has been about 1.71 billion against the total inflow
of 2.4 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) predicts an
actual inflow of four billion dollars this year, almost twice the
last year figure. The total inflow since 1991 is estimated to be
8.09 billion dollars while the total FDI approvals between 1991 to
1997 (up to May) is pegged at 37.12 billion dollars.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Car thefts in Israel have been
continuning to rise sharply as some 21,500 cars were stolen in the
first half of the year, 30 percent up from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Zeev Weiner, President of Israel Association of Insurance
Agents, was quoted by Israeli news agency Itim as saying Monday
that the number of stolen vehicles in Israel would be 45,000 at
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In July alone, more than 4,000 vehicles were stolen in Israel,
or 28 percent more than in the same month last year, Weiner said.
</P>
<P>
Weiner attributed the drop in insurance companies' profits to
the rise in the number of stolen vehicles over the past year, and
he blamed the government for not allocating sufficient resources

<P>
Weiner called on the government to crack down on car thefts,
adding that his association was considering a petition to the
High Court against the government for "not doing enough to
protect its citizens and their property."
</P>
<P>
It is believed there is a well-organized net for car thefts
which links Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas. Most of
the stolen cars ended up in the Palestinian areas, where they were
disassembled into parts, either to be re-assembled to build new
cars or to be sold to customers at low prices.
</P>
<P>
"One has to act as in a war," Weiner said. "The theft of cars
is first and foremost a personal threat to all citizens of the
state, more than a financial loss."
</P>
<P>
Israeli insurance companies are scheduled to hold a conference
on September 8 in Eilat to discuss, among other things, the threat
of car thefts.

<HEADLINE> China Increasing Use of Biological Potash Fertilizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAODING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Environmental-friendly
biological potash fertilizer has been used on more than 30 kinds
of plants in China and more than four million ha of farmland,
according to a recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
The fertilizer was developed by the Hebei Academy of
Sciences. It dissolves compounds in the soil into potash by
biological means, after which potash elements can be absorbed by
plants.
</P>
<P>
The fertilizer can greatly increase crop output and improve
soil quality. It also does not harm humans.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of China's farmland lacks potash and resources
are scarce, and potash deposits are only found in northwest
China's Qinghai province.
</P>
<P>
To increase the use of the fertilizer, a production line with
an annual capacity of 10,000 tons began test operation in Baoding
in April. It is listed as one of the country's key projects and is
the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Hebei Academy of Sciences has held two training sessions on
the new fertilizer for 44 foreign students from 13 countries.
</P>
<P>
The fertilizer has also been exported to India, Thailand, and
Vietnam. Joint ventures are expected to be set up in India and
Thailand to produce the fertilizer.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka's 100-Day Military Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- On May 13, Sri Lanka's
government troops launched a major military offensive against the
Tamil rebels to recapture 75 kilometers of the main South-North
highway through territory held by the rebels of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The operation code-named "Jaya Sikuru" (Certain Victory)
launched by 25,000 troops has after 100 days of battle enabled the
forces to recapture a mere 25 kilometers of roadway at a cost of
500 soldiers dead and 3,000 others injured together with six main
battle tanks and a Russian-built amphibious armored personnel
carrier worth 90,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to military statistics, the loss of the LTTE is
reported to be over 2,000 dead but the rebels deny this.
</P>
<P>
Since last Tuesday, a fierce battle was launched to recapture
the strategic town of Puliyankulam standing at the cross roads to
the entrance of the Northern province.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, at a cost of 95 soldiers dead
and over 300 injured, the forces recaptured the Puliyankulam
railway station three kilometers away from the town proper Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Heavily fortified LTTE bunkers are offering severe resistance
to the forces who are trying hard to inch their way forward, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the current operation was the re-opening of
the Vavuniya-Jaffna highway known as A 9 number road. This was to
re-establish a government controlled land route between Vavuniya
and the Jaffna Peninsula through the Northern mainland controlled
to a great extent by the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the road would help the government transport
essential food items and construction materials in great volume at
cheap cost to the Jaffna Peninsula. It would also help the armed
forces maintain a main supply route to military positions over
land.
</P>
<P>
Currently transportation is only by sea and air at heavy cost.
</P>
<P>
However, from the rebels' point of view, the loss of
Puliyankulam town will bring the army perilously close to the
Mankulam-Mullaitivu road which splits their territory stretching
from the West coast to the East coast where most of the rebel
camps are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Mullaitivu is the largest town in the rebel
territory and they would not want the military anywhere there.
Hence one of the fiercest battles can be expected during the
forces effort to recapture Puliyankulam town.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the slow progress of the Jaya Sikuru troops, there
has been increasing vulnerablitity to rebel counter-attacks. The
LTTE rebels have launched three major counter-offensives during
the 100 days of fighting and both sides suffered heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
They even almost downed an aircraft with a Stinger missile.
</P>
<P>
The troops appear to have been caught in a vicious circle. As
troop positions get dispersed vulnerability increases and the
rebels exploit it, some Tamil sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The lack of adequate manpower to hold and fortify captured
areas is an additional problem faced by the government forces,
they added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Tightens Rules for Finance Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has
introduced new rules concerning the non-performing loans of banks
and finance firms in a bid to strengthen its supervision over the
country's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, commercial banks and finance companies,
from January 1 next year, must count loans on which borrowers have
not paid interest for over six months as non-performing loans,
regardless of whether they are fully or partly collateralized.
</P>
<P>
This measure will better reflect the loan problems in the
country's financial system and force financial institutions to act
early to prevent the problems from aggravating, officials from the
central bank said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, fully collateralized loans are considered
non-performing in Thailand when the borrowers failed to pay
interest for 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the new rules will certainly make the
non-performing loans, which are now estimated at 11 to 12 percent
of the total loans in Thailand, further rise.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks will have to raise lending rates to offset the
higher non-performing loans, they added.
</P>
<P>
High non-performing loans are already expected by foreign
investors, so higher figures may not surprise them, according to
Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala, director of the central bank's
Financial Institutions Supervision Department.
</P>
<P>
Thirachai also said that the central bank would tighten the
credit approval criteria of banks and finance firms through a
tougher check and broader appraisal system, including involving
more supervisors or institutions into the approval procedures.

DHAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's major opposition
parties are expected to announce their "tougher" anti-government
agitation programs at their separate public rallies today, in a
bid to drum up support for a movement against the fuel price hike.
</P>
<P>
Following a dawn-to-dusk general strike Sunday, the largest
opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) today held a new
round of country-wide demonstrations to keep their protest alive.
</P>
<P>
Some small opposition parties, including Jamaat-e-Islami and
the dissident faction of Jatiya (national) Party, are also
expected to hold their rallies this afternoon, said informed
sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the opposition parties in a joint
meeting Monday chalked out "tougher" programs, which include
processions towards the Parliament building simultaneously on
August 30, the day the sixth session of the Parliament is
scheduled to begin.
</P>
<P>
The parties also planned to submit separate memorandums to the
Speaker, complaining against what they call the government's
tendency to take major policy decisions bypassing the Parliament.
They would also seek the Speaker's intervention in such cases.
</P>
<P>
The government on August 18 refixed the prices of all petroleum
products, which triggered sharp reactions among different
political parties and transport circles.

<HEADLINE> Brunei Continues Employing Nepali Gurkhas: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Brunei officials have denied
that their country has stopped recruiting former British Gurkha
Army officers into its security unit, Nepali newspapers reported
today.
</P>
<P>
They have also denied that there was an immediate plan to stop
the recruitment of the renowned Nepalese fighters, the Nepali
newspapers quoted a Brunei newspaper report as saying.
</P>
<P>
But there is a long-term plan to eventually phase them out of
the Gurkha Reserve Unit (GRU) in Brunei, where some 2,000 Nepalese
are working, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
They said members of the GRU are the ex-army personnel of the
British forces who have been directly hired by the Brunei
government as security guards and not as soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Nepali newspapers reported early this month that the government
of Brunei had decided to stop recruiting former British Gurkha
Army officers into the GRU and that all the Nepali officers
working in the GRU had been disarmed for acting against army
disciplines.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said some Gurkhas formed a group within the
GRU and raised money in the name of fighting a case against the
British government for equal pension as being enjoyed by their
British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The Brunei officials have confirmed the disarming of the GRU,
but said this was done long before the crisis in the GRU.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed Brunei newspaper said the recent crisis in the GRU
was actually one between some Gurkha ex-servicemen and their
former British commanders.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed in 1947 between Britain, India and
Nepal, British and Indian armies can recruit Nepalese, who are
called Gurkha soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Cultural Heritage Valued low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Italy's cultural heritage, usually
described as "priceless," has in fact had a price-tag pinned on it
by state accountants, amazingly, just one twelfth of the value of
the country's defense weaponry.
</P>
<P>
The figure emerged from the latest estimate of state assets,
but the state accountants wryly admitted that it is "clearly
undervalued."
</P>
<P>
According to estimates based on the 1995 budget, Italian
heritage assets are worth about 3.9 trillion lire (2.3 billion
U.S. dollars), the accountants said. That compares to more than 49
trillion lire (28 billion dollars) for all the weapons owned by
Italy's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Another surprising fact was that about two thirds of the
heritage value comes from library collections: 2.6 trillion
lire. Only 1.3 trillion is put down as the value of assets owned
by the Cultural Heritage Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The accountants said all the monuments and art works are valued
low because the 1927 law sets no guidelines for reassessing the
initial book value.
</P>
<P>
Heritage assets were valued even lower in the past, the
accountants said. Through most of the 1990s they were put at
around 2 trillion lire, rising to 2.4 trillion in 1994.

WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Half the young black men in
the District of Columbia, the capital of the United States, are
under criminal justice supervision on any given day, the National
Center on Institutions and Alternatives reported today.
</P>
<P>
The group, in a study focused on black men aged 18 to 35, found
that half the young black people are in prison, on probation or
parole, or out on bond or a warrant.
</P>
<P>
The report said by the time a young black man reaches the age
of 35, his chance of having spent time locked up exceeds 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
District Mayor Marion Barry called the findings "alarming and
disappointing."
</P>
<P>
A nationwide study in 1995 estimated that one in three black
men was involved in the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the high rates to the use of law
enforcement to manage social problems, including mental illness
and drug abuse, which were previously handled by other means.

KIEV, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and the United States
started their joint naval exercise in Crimea today despite protest
from some members in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, code-named Sea Breeze-97, is a seven-stage mock
relief operation which aims to provide and escort humanitarian aid
to an imaginary Orange Republic after a major earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The marine stage of the exercise is supposed to be carried out
in Crimea's offing followed by a landing operation at the Broad
Lawn training range in the Mykolaiv region.
</P>
<P>
About 25 warships and supportive vessels and some planes from
Ukraine, the United States, Bulgaria, Turkey, Romania and Georgia
are taking part in the week-long maneuver.
</P>
<P>
Only 300 marines from Ukraine and the U.S. will participate in
the land exercise, which is to be held near Odessa. Greece, Italy,
India, Canada, Britain, Lithuania, Moldova are posed as
observers.
</P>
<P>
However, Sea Breeze-97 has met a running fire from some
deputies in the Ukrainian parliament. Residents in Crimean, who
are mostly Russians, are holding protest rallies against the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, about 50 pro-Russian protesters showed up in
Donuzlav, which is a Ukrainian naval base and where the marine
exercise will be staged. Protesters chanted anti-U.S. slogans and
poured severe criticism over the Ukrainian authorities.
</P>
<P>
On August 23, some anti-NATO protesters picketed the House of
Navel Officers in Donuzlav when a press conference was going on.
</P>
<P>
The land exercise which had been planned near Sevastopol, the
main base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, had been forced to move
to Odessa due to intense pressure from both local residents and
the Ukrainian parliament.

<HEADLINE> Child-Abduction by Parents Increases in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Rome, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of children being
snatched by one of their parents is increasing in Italy,
according to data released by the European central bureau for
justice for minors.
</P>
<P>
One cause seems to be the growing number of marriages between
Italian and foreigners. In the case of a separation, difficulties
over child custody rights frequently lead to the child being
abducted by the foreign partner and brought up abroad.
</P>
<P>
Between 1995 and the first month of 1997, there were 159 cases
of "international" child-snatching in Italy. Despite international

<HEADLINE> Krajisnik Boycotts Bosnian Presidential Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb
member of the Bosnian Presidency, refused to attend a presidential
session Monday, citing reasons related to the political crisis in
the Republic of Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik did not show up at the scheduled meeting of the
presidency but sent a letter to his colleagues saying that he is
temporarily prevented from taking part in its work, said Mirza
Hajric, an advisor to Alija Izetbegovic, Muslim member and
chairman of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Westendorp, the international community's High
Representative in Bosnia, later told reporters that Krajisnik has
said that he will not participate in the work of the common
Bosnian institutions until the problem of the Banja Luka stations
is solved.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik's boycott came amid intensified power struggle
between him and the President of the Republic of Srpska, Biljana
Plavsic, whose supporters have taken over police stations in Banja
Luka with the help of the NATO-led Stablization Force (SFOR).
</P>
<P>
Monday's session was due to discuss a compromise proposed by
Westendorp on the issue of draft laws on citizenship and
passports, which has been accepted in principle by the Muslim and
Croat sides but still resisted by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp said that owing to the present circumstances he would
propose to Western powers sanction measures, such as denial of
visas, against some Serb officials.

<HEADLINE> Trade Between Mexico, Costa Rica Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's Foreign Trade
Minister Jose Manuel Salazar today commended the growing trade
between his country and Mexico since the signing of a bilateral
free trade agreement in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's exports to Mexico rose from 15 million
U.S. dollars in 1995 to 51 million dollars in 1996, and are
expected to reach 64 million dollars in 1997 and 80 million
dollars in 1998, Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
The free trade agreement was sharply criticized by various
sectors in the two countries in 1994 when the accord was signed
during the economic crisis in Mexico and Costa Rica. But Salazar
rejected the criticism, saying that the agreement was good for
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's exports to Mexico have been up since 1996. The
figure dropped from 23 million dollars to 15 million dollars in
1994-95.
</P>
<P>
The minister said 10 percent of 400 million dollars of direct
foreign investment in Costa Rica came from Mexico last year. But
before the accord, no such Mexican investments had occurred in
Costa Rica, Salazar added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng's
visit to Singapore will deepen the Singapore-China relations and
further bilateral cooperation, Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee
Hsien Loong said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a welcoming meeting for Li Peng by Singapore's
business community, Lee said bilateral economic ties have steadily
improved, and trade, tourism and investment have all expanded
strongly.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between 1992 and 1996 doubled and Singapore
companies continue to invest steadily in China, he said, adding
that Singapore investment in China has exceeded 23 billion U.S.
dollars, making it the 5th largest investor in China.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore projects in China reflect the Singapore
government's commitment to bilateral cooperation, and provide a
tangible focus for the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that a total of 6,900 projects have been initiated
by Singapore companies in China, in diversified areas ranging from
manufacturing to the development of industrial parks, property and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore businessmen are keen to invest in China. They sense
the bountiful opportunities and the prospect for continued
dramatic progress," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that China is going through a period of "exciting
change." Its economic reforms have steadily opened up China's
economy to the rest of the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
The result has been rapid economic growth, a steady increase in
exports, and a dramatic improvement in the standards of living of
the people, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
"China has also become the single largest destination for
foreign investment among developing countries," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that China and countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) need to strengthen coordination
and cooperation in the financial field.
</P>
<P>
"We should intensify our coordination and cooperation in the
field of finance and step up the exchange of information so as to
ward off international financial speculation," Li told Singaporean
businessmen in a speech.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, many Asian countries and regions, including
China and ASEAN states, have maintained the momentum of rapid
economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we are soberly aware that, compared with developed
countries, the economic strength of countries and regions like
ours is still relatively weak and the financial system not
adequate."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Asian countries and regions are more vulnerable to
the impact of international financial speculation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We should seriously draw lessons from previous financial
crises in the world, keep a high degree of vigilance, strengthen
financial regulation and improve the financial system so as to
forestall and reduce financial risks to the minimum," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Sees Long-Term Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
today that his country's economy will keep a sound momentum of
growth for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"Various factors show that China's economy will maintain its
sound momentum of growth," Li told Singaporean businessmen in an
address.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier is in Singapore for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
He said "enormous changes" have taken place since China adopted
the reform and opening-up policy in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
"Economic reform and reform in other fields are developing in
depth."
</P>
<P>
A socialist market economy was gradually taking shape and an
overall pattern of opening-up had come into being. A relatively
high economic growth has been maintained and the living standards
in both urban and rural areas have been notably improved, the
premier enumerated.
</P>
<P>
China has formulated a development plan for the last five years
of this century and long-range objectives until the year 2010, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The coming 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China will make significant arrangements for China's reform,
opening-up, modernization drive and in particular, ways to develop
the socialist market economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It will inevitably have a major and profound impact on China's
future development.
</P>
<P>
"We have recovered smoothly from the period of grief after the
passing of Deng Xiaoping. China enjoys political stability,
economic development and ethnic unity and the Chinese people are
living and working in peace and contentment.
</P>
<P>
"Under the collective central leadership with President Jiang
Zemin at the core, the Chinese people are marching with full
confidence toward the goal of modernization along the road of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by Deng
Xiaoping," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Hong Kong will enjoy long-term
prosperity and stability following its return to China.
</P>
<P>
"The entire Chinese people, including compatriots in Hong Kong,
and the international community have full confidence about its
long-term prosperity and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the smooth return of Hong Kong to the motherland, the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government has
been operating smoothly and the Basic Law of the HKSAR has been
effectively implemented, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Despite a rosy future for China's economy, the premier also
pointed out that there are still difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"China has made remarkable achievements in economic
development. However, viewed as a whole, its development is uneven
and its per capita income is still pretty low. There still exist
quite a few problems and difficulties on our way ahead," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"It will take up several more decades of hard work to realize
modernization and reach the development level of moderately
developed countries," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Fuel prices at the Petroleum
Authority of Thailand's filling stations rose by another 15 satang
per liter today, the seventh increase since the baht flotation on
July 2.
</P>
<P>
The latest price hikes reflect higher oil costs spurred by the
weakened baht which has now tumbled to about 34 baht to the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The baht stood at about 26 to the dollar before July 2.
</P>
<P>
The new pump prices at the Petroleum Authority of Thailand's
service stations in Bangkok are 10.80 baht per liter for premium
gasoline, 10.33 baht for regular gasoline and 9.56 baht for
high-speed diesel oil.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said further fuel price rises are likely if the
baht continues its downward path.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Urges Closer Economic Ties with ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
called for enhanced cooperation with the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, saying it would contribute to
growth and stability in the region as well as in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation between China and ASEAN nations should be
oriented toward the 21st century," Li told a group of Singapore
businessmen on the last day of his three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation... is not an expediency, it is rather a
long-term strategy," Li said. "It is conducive not only to our
respective economic development, but also to peace and stability
of the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
"It also serves as the foundation for political diversity in
the world," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China and ASEAN countries will both benefit from expanded
cooperation, as their economies are "highly complementary to each
other," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China needs to learn from the ASEAN countries' experience in
developing the economy, and it could also provide a huge market
for ASEAN exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
While reaffirming China's commitment to promote trade with
southeast Asian countries, Li appealed to the ASEAN governments to
create more favorable conditions for cooperation between both
sides' business communities.
</P>
<P>
"Our market will continue to be open to ASEAN countries," he
said, adding that China is also ready to invest in southeast
Asia, setting up solely Chinese-funded or joint ventures there
with capital and technology.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged the two sides to open up "flexible and
multi-formed" channels and exploit new areas of cooperation,
including infrastructure, technological transfer, poverty
alleviation and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Create Defense Ministry by 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government will
create a new Defense Ministry before the end of 1998, said Chief
of the Military House Alberto Cardoso in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Cardoso said the creation of the new military
organization is part of a worldwide trend, but Brazil does not
want to copy models from other countries. He said the minister's
post could be granted to a civilian.
</P>
<P>
Brazil dose not have a defense ministry, but it has separate
ministries for the air force, the navy and the army.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the military house of the presidency denied any
relation between this project and the recent rebellion by military
policemen.
</P>
<P>
On August 22, President Fernando Cardoso met the country's
military ministers to discuss issues relevant to the creation of
the new Defense Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Government Assistance In Central China Helping Feed The Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhengzhou, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The fledging social welfare
system in central China's Henan Province is working on a security
net for the poorest of its rural population.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government began in May to provide assistance to
farmers who are getting by on a yearly income of less than 500
yuan (about 62 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Though the amount of assistance is small, it can at least keep
food on the table of poor people and help them avoid starvation,
which is a priority in the country's poverty-relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
The government assistance is usually in the form of grain,
augmented with a small sum of cash, and is paid for by the county,
township and village in which the poor people reside.
</P>
<P>
This form of social welfare is now reaching some 4.9 million
people in the province with a population of 90 million.

GUANGZHOU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence in Hong
Kong and inland areas has gone up recently, according to a survey
by Visa International.
</P>
<P>
It shows an overall consumer confidence index for Hong Kong of
60.5 points on a 100-point scale, up from 59.1 points at the end
of last year. Confidence in the Hong Kong economy as a whole
soared to 77 points from 66.7 points at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The overall consumer confidence index for China's inland areas,
which was first included in these surveys last December, jumped to
74 points from 67 points.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that consumers in Guangzhou, the capital
of Guangdong province, a showcase of market economy reforms in
China, are more confident than those in Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In general, Chinese consumers are optimistic about the standard
of living, overall economic performance, and their regular
earnings.

Visa International began the survey of consumer confidence in
the Asia-Pacific region in 1993 on a six-month basis based on five
indicators: job opportunities, the overall economic situation,
regular earnings, stock market performance, and standard of
living.

TAIYUAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province
has removed 179 general managers of local state-owned enterprises
who were considered unqualified, and has gotten younger, more
competent candidates to take their place.
</P>
<P>
The unqualified people were lowered in grade or dismissed
because of incompetence as part of a recent provincial government
campaign to look into the quality of enterprise leaders.
</P>
<P>
Local governments studied the record of nearly 18,961 managers
of 4,040 state-owned enterprises, or 73 percent of the province's
total, and promoted 2,057 people as new general managers.
</P>
<P>
Younger people who passed the requisite examinations were
chosen in their place.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that the move is meant to revitalize the
local economy. The incompetence of many state-owned enterprise
managers has long been considered a major cause of the poor
performance of the sector.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province Goes Well With Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
province, one of the oldest and largest industrial bases in the
country, has made major progress in industrial reforms, according
to the provincial planning commission, which says that in 1996,
Liaoning achieved notable success in the reform of its old
industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The central government has made it a pioneer in industrial
reforms and of the 100 firms selected by the state to experiment
with a modern enterprise system, 35 are in Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Its industrial and technological upgrading has been
enhanced. The debt-asset ratio in state enterprises in Shenyang,
Dalian, Anshan, Fushun and Benxi cities has dropped to 61.9
percent from 66.2 percent at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Last year 19.92 billion yuan was spent on 2,930 projects, 1,838
of which have been completed, and technological upgrading has
added 13.91 billion yuan in fixed assets, 27.78 billion in sales,
and 4.69 billion yuan in pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
A third of the large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises
are doing better and ownership has changed hands in 70 percent of
the small state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The province has added another 100 state companies to the pilot
project.

<HEADLINE> Making East China Port International Shipping Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Lianyungang, in China's Jiangsu
province, is trying to build itself into an international cargo
hub for the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
It now has 28 berths, 22 of which have a handling capacity of
10,000 tons each, and a combined annual capacity of 22.25 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of the year, Lianyungang saw its
cargo volume rise to 21,583 containers handled, an eight-fold
increase from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The port is also expecting four new berths with a handling
capacity of over 10,000 tons each.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study has shown it to be an ideal port with
potential for 50,000-ton or 100,000-ton berths. The expected
completion of a 6,700 m.-long embankment will accelerate the pace
of becoming an international port with annual cargo capacity of
more than 100 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Because it is mid-way along China's east coast, Lianyungang is
important to cargo transport from northern to southern parts of
the country and with countries on the Pacific rim.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Go To Work By Bus In East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Farmers don't usually take the
bus to work, but that's what they're doing in the Pudong New Area
of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Most of farmers there have left the land and found work in
industry nearby, because of the quick urbanization of the Pudong
New Area. But there is still a group who miss the land and the
days of planting vegetables, and who haven't adapted to the new
way of life in new apartments easily.
</P>
<P>
So the Yanqiao Township government leased a piece of land from
neighboring Sunqiao Township as "recreation land" in 1993. and
many farmers have registered to work on the land. The Yanqiao
Township government also purchased a bus for these "new farmers"
to commute.
</P>
<P>
The land has been turned into a vegetable base for Shanghai
residents and the farmers' income has been increasing. Each is
paid 600 yuan per month.
</P>
<P>
One of the farmers, Grandma Wei, is still good at planting
vegetables in her sixties and says, "I think it is a good way to
keep fit, and when I come back to the vegetable field, my problems
go away."
</P>
<P>
Many young farmers have joined their colleagues in planting
vegetables and earn more than those working in factories, because
of their hard work. The phenomenon has also spread to neighboring
townships.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Stocks Down on Tight Liquidity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Jakarta Stock Exchange's
composite index fell a record 5.5 percent Monday to close at the
lowest level in one year, amid worry over high interest rates and
tight liquidity, economic analysts here said today.
</P>
<P>
The composite index plunged by 31.748 points Monday to close at
542.647, down from 574.4 last Friday. The index peaked at 742.95
on July 7.
</P>
<P>
Brokers and analysts blamed high interest rates for the slump
in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia, the central bank, last week sharply raised
short-term interest rates to squeeze liquidity and shore up the
newly floated rupiah after it breached the 3,000 level against the
U.S. dollar for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rupiah weakened Monday against the U.S. dollar
to close at 2,712 rupiah, down from 2,700 rupiah last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the rupiah needs two to three months to stabilize
and would ultimately settle in a band between 2,700 rupiah and
2,800 rupiah to the dollar. At the start of July, the spot price
in Jakarta was 2,450 rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah fell to an historic low of 3,045 against the dollar
after the central bank floated the rupiah on August 14 in the wake
of sustained speculative attacks on regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah started recovering following the central bank's
raising of interest rates last Tuesday. The bank doubled the
short-term interest rates.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Pay increases have been lower
than economic growth in Costa Rica during the past 12 years, a
study carried out by the Economy and Finance Consulting Company
said.
</P>
<P>
Wages grew by six percent during the past 12 years, while the
entire economy grew by 56 percent, the consulting firm said.
</P>
<P>
The study showed the gap between the rich and poor in the
country has widened.
</P>
<P>
In the same time, employment rose by 42 percent, showing that
the Costa Rican economy had favored job-creation over pay
increases.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment remains relatively low in the country, slightly
above six percent, and research shows the average income in the
public sector is higher than that in the private one.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, the average income in the
private sector was 53,000 colones (about 225 U.S. dollars) a
month, while it reached 108,000 colones (about 457 dollars) in

MADRID, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Spain's Soccer Players
Association (AFE) voted to call a strike on Monday against too
many foreign players in Spanish soccer league, according to state
television.
</P>
<P>
Pedro Antonio Martin, Spain's Sports Secretary, would have a

The Professional Soccer League and the Spanish Soccer

"foreign" players to six on each team squad with four allowed on
the pitch at any one time. But such deal did not satisfy the local
players who believed the deal did not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
The first day's action of the season starts on Sunday, which
will not be affected by the strike because there is a legal
waiting period of five days.

<HEADLINE> China Takes First Diving Gold at Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MESSINA, Sicily, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China took the first gold
medal of the Universiade diving tournament as Lu Haisong scored 275.16
points in the final here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lu, a student from Nanjing Physical Culture and Sports Education
Institute, beat her compatriot Chen Lixia to the second place.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Lu, whose best result was merely a sixth place
finishing at the national champions cup, ranked only fourth after
afternoon's semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
In the five-dive final, Lu collected 62.40 point from her second
dive of forward one and a half samersaults at pike position, the
highest score of the competitions.
</P>
<P>
With a low total degree of difficulty compared with Chen and two
American divers Jennifer Lingamfelter and Michelle Rojohn, Lu executed
all her five dives successfully and got 58.32, 51.06, 52.56 and 50.82
points in a row to secure the first place.

<P>
Chen Lixia, who led the six divers into the final, managed to take
the silver medal despite of catching a cold in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Chen got only 49.92 points from her second dive and that proved
fatal to her. Yet her 266.85 total is still 1.05 points more than
Rojohn who finished third.
</P>
<P>
Jin Haiquan, coach of the Chinese diving team, was quite satisfied
with the results:"Our divers did quite good today. It was a long and
tiring day for them as they competed from 8 in the morning till 9 at
night."

performance in the final." Jin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- the United States on Monday
welcomed a U.N. team to investigate alleged massacres of Rwandan
refugees by soldiers loyal to Congoless President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Upon the arrival of the U.N. investigative team in Kinshasa,
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the United States
wants "to have a thorough and impartial investigation to get to
the bottom of the very serious charges of massacres and atrocities
that have been made."
</P>
<P>
"The Congolese authorities have repeatedly pledged their full
cooperation with this team, and the United States has made it clear
that we expect them to keep their word," Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
According to Rubin the team's investigation will take several
months and should be completed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the slain refugees were Rwandan Hutus who had fled
into eastern Zaire in 1994 when Rwandan Tutsis took over power
in the central country.

<HEADLINE> Report: CFC Alternatives Cause Liver Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The first cases of liver
disease caused by two industrial refrigerants, alternative to
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), had been confirmed, according to the
latest edition of The Lancet magazine.
</P>
<P>
The magazine reported that nine workers became ill after
accidental exposure to HCFC-123 and HCFC-124. HCFCs were known as
halogenated hydrochlorofluorocarbons.
</P>
<P>
CFCs, which seriously damage the ozone layer and make our
planet warmer, were banned in use in 1990 by an international
treaty in order to save the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
The workers, employed in an unidentified Belgian smelting
facility where they drove an overhead gantry, worked in a gantry
cabin connected to the same air-conditioning system.
</P>
<P>
Some plastic piping had perforated, allowing HCFCs to leak into
the cabin.
</P>
<P>
The Lancet reported that one of the workers in the cabin became
ill with symptoms of acute hepatitis, followed soon after by
another gantry driver.
</P>
<P>
Then researchers found specific protein in liver cells taken
from the workers that are associated with HCFC toxicity.
</P>
<P>
The results of this study show that repeated exposure of human
beings to HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver injury in
high proportion of the exposed population, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
It urged the industries to take very strict measures of
containment to prevent accidental exposure of the refrigerants.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Faces Cuts Because of Financial Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Carol Bellamy, the
executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
said today the organization was cutting its staff by about seven
percent because of financial problems.
</P>
<P>
"The abolition of around 950 posts is offset by the creation of
500 new posts in the 1998-99 biennium, resulting in a net
reduction of about 450 posts or approximately seven percent of
staff worldwide," said Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
But she promised to try to find new jobs for those whose jobs
are abolished.
</P>
<P>
She cited two main reasons for the job cuts: a decline in funds
available for development assistance and the strengthening of the
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF employs about 6,050 staff worldwide, including 570 at
U.N. headquarters.
