STAR'S TIES TO L.A. SUBURB STRONG

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ s soon as she heard about Roy Rogers' death,
Virginia Watson started planning to showcase his life and work in
Chatsworth, a community in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The curator of the Chatsworth Museum on Shadow Oak Drive, Watson
knows much about the years the ``King of the Cowboys'' spent here
and how he used the area often to film movies and television shows,
particularly on the Iverson Ranch in the Santa Susana Pass.
</P>
<P>
   But while most fans knew only Rogers the legend, Watson knew
Rogers and his wife and co-star Dale Evans as real community-caring
folk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were never stuck up. They always invited the kids up to
their home. They had a big playroom and billiard room,'' said
Watson, a longtime Chatsworth resident. ``Their home was a
gathering spot, which was unusual for movie stars.''
</P>
<P>
   All around town, people reminisced Monday about the good, family
folks they remembered or heard about. They recalled Rogers' last
public appearance here, at the opening for the Chatsworth Metrolink
train depot in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Up on Trigger Street, named after the cowboy's famous palomino,
Roy Rogers' former ranch home is now surrounded by newer, lavish
houses developed after he sold off his ranch.
</P>
<P>
   His legacy lives on in the neighborhood, however. A block over
from his ranch house _ where actor Val Kilmer was later raised _
people live on Trigger Place and Dale Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to watch him when I was this tall,'' said real estate
broker Michael Harris, swinging an open palm at his hip. ``He was
always the good guy. He always wore a white hat.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood is studded with views that look like scenes
from his western movies and television shows, shot here from 1935
to 1963.
</P>
<P>
   A fan who identified himself only as Bernie lives next door to
Roger's former ranch. And he swears he has a piece of the actor's
landscape right out back, by the blue, mosaic-tile underground
pool.
</P>
<P>
   It's a massive boulder shaped slightly like an ancient hand ax.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a scene where someone was standing on top. When I
first saw it, it flashed right back to me,'' Bernie said, though he
couldn't recall which of Rogers' 90-some movies the boulder
appeared in.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents moved in well after the Rogers family moved out
and the area has changed plenty since. Roy Rogers played golf and
started a gun club on what has now become parkland and
condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still plenty of Old West-style quaintness.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the hill, a small sign posted at the front of
the Oakwood Memorial Park reads, ``Caution: Rattlesnake season.''
Homes for sale come with signs that read, ``Horses Okay.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking the hills in town feels like stepping into a scene from
one of Rogers' singing cowboy westerns. The breeze sends the
wildflowers and tall grass tucked between jumbles of buff-color
boulders rippling against a bright, blue sky.
</P>
<P>
   Residents say they cherish hearing coyotes and peacocks at
night.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Mininberg, 60, lives across the street from the
original Roy Rogers home. She watched his films since she was 6,
growing up in Long Island, N.Y. She moved to Trigger Street 12
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have lived here while he was here,'' she
said with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, at the Chatsworth Museum, first met Rogers and Evans in
the 1940s. Their daughters were friends at Sutter Junior High.
</P>
<P>
   Watson remembers fondly the times when Rogers' daughter Linda
worked as a soda jerk at the ice cream parlor Watson owned with her
husband. It sat next to the local post office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale would come in and read her mail,'' Watson said. ``I
remember him. He was so funny. He always blew the paper off his
straw.''
</P>
<P>
   But something changed for the couple after another of their
daughters, Debbie, was killed in a bus crash. Not long after, they
left town for good.
</P>
<P>
   Before Rogers and Evans retired in 1976 to Victorville, the
couple donated the last $1,000 in the little girl's bank account to
help save and move Chatsworth's historic Pioneer Church, which the
family had attended for years. Watson was in charge of the project.

FOR A DOCTOR, A RACE BETWEEN TWO CLOCKS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the term used by medical people, Dr. Kim Griffin
is an intensivist. For the last five years she has spent 11 or 12
hours a day, five days a week as the assistant director of the
cardiac-thoracic intensive care unit at Mount Sinai Hospital on
Manhattan's Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   When the day is done, and before it begins, she is the other Kim
Griffin, the one who runs to work from her Upper West Side
apartment through Central Park, then runs home, sometimes sneaking
in an extra six-mile loop.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends she may race, not in the middle of the pack but up
front, as befits a former national champion who leads a double life
as doctor and runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like two people,'' Griffin said in an interview
last week, ``but sometimes I think I am. I have one role, and an
hour later I have another. I like that. It keeps me refreshed
because I'm doing a different thing. Then I go home and have
another life with my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine is 4 and Caroline is 3. And while their mother is
working, a baby-sitter or their father, Patrick, a freelance
computer specialist, keeps tabs on them.
</P>
<P>
   Given her limitations, Griffin has done unbelievably well. Last
November, in her first marathon, she was the 19th woman (and the
second American women) to finish in the New York City Marathon. Her
time was 2 hours 50 minutes 25 seconds, and if an Achilles' tendon
had not tightened at 20 miles, she might have run 10 minutes
faster.
</P>
<P>
   In May, in the first of the year's Chase Corporate Challenges,
she beat the 5,911 other female finishers over the course of three
and a half miles in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   In June, she beat 6,000 women in the 10-kilometer Avon Mini
Marathon in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, she will run in the third and last Corporate
Challenge of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That race in May was my first since the marathon,'' she said.
``I ran at a pace of a 5:40 mile almost from memory. The week after
my whole body revolted.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she feels better and is eager to race. At age 36, she is the
picture of fitness: 5 feet 6 inches, 115 pounds, with bright brown
eyes and a sense of adventure that keeps her running ambitions
high.
</P>
<P>
   Those ambitions were high in 1982, when, as Kim Schnurpfeil, a
Stanford junior from Burlingame, Calif., she won the national
collegiate and U.S. 10,000-meter titles. In time, medical school
and hospital duties became a greater priority. She accepted that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I train enough to run at a high level,'' Griffin
said. ``My goal was always to be the best. I always believed I
could run on the international level. I consider myself still a
good athlete, but I don't sit around and say if I did this or that,
I could win the New York City Marathon. There are too many things
going on in my life. I enjoy running, and I do what I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me still wants improvement. I would like to run a
marathon in 2:40, but I'm not going to go crazy. Your kids are very
important. I do take some time away from them because I run. And
when you're a doctor and you're at work, you might think about
other things, but your job is your job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to get up at 10 minutes before six in the morning, take
my time, drink a cup of coffee, wait for the bus and go to work.
Now I get up 10 minutes earlier, run from 6 to 6:30 through Central
Park from home to the hospital and take an extra loop. I shower at
the hospital and I'm ready to work at 7 o'clock with a workout
behind me. After work, I run home.
</P>
<P>
   ``On weekends, the kids like to sleep late, so I run early and
get home as they get up. And I have the whole day with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin trains about 40 miles a week. She hopes to get that up
to 70 or 80 miles a week before the New York City Marathon in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' she said, ``it all seems too much. But the way I
use running, it helps me deal with stress. It kind of relaxes you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to avoid telling myself that I have to win races. I have
to remind myself I'm doing this for fun. If your accomplishments
meet your expectations, you're on the right track. There are a lot
of things I could be doing better. I have to accept that I do what
I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin accepts that because she sees what her routine does for
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in better shape,'' she said, ``I have more energy.
The benefits of exercise are great. I want to stay healthy. I could
do more academic things, but I'm not sure if I did I could be that
much better a person. Putting the running in makes you more
efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   But if she could train like full-time distance runners, with 150
or so miles a week plus speed work and weight training, how good
could she be? Griffin smiled at the thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wondered what it would be like if I trained harder and
competed at the highest level,'' she said. ``I kind of wish I could
do that, but I can't. I think I would go crazy. I'm not cut out for
that. My mind needs to be more active than just run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound like I'm trying out for Miss America,
but I've been fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get satisfaction taking care of other people and in some
ways contributing to the world.'' &QL;

NEW YORK SEES UNLIMITED-RIDE METROCARD AS A WORKADAY SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the first workday that they were on sale, the new
transit passes that offer unlimited rides on the city's subways and
buses on Monday caused long lines at some token booths and minor
confusion throughout the system. But over all, transit officials
said, the new passes were a success.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the
cards, which were introduced on Saturday and cost $17 for 7 days of
unlimited rides and $63 for 30 days, continued to sell very
briskly, though they did not have any firm sales figures. ``The
closest you could come to a number is saying that we've probably
sold in the tens of thousands of passes,'' said Christopher Boylan,
a deputy executive director of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   At the Union Street station in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and at the
86th Street station on the Lexington Avenue line on the East Side
of Manhattan, among others, rush-hour lines at the token booths
extended up the stairs, which regular riders said was unusual even
for a Monday, when many commuters typically replenish their
Metrocards. But at many other stations, including several on
Manhattan's Upper West Side and at the Atlantic Avenue station in
downtown Brooklyn, lines were about normal.
</P>
<P>
   At the 42nd Street station underneath the Port Authority Bus
Terminal, the line moved slowly Monday morning, in large part
because of the unfamiliarity of the new passes.
</P>
<P>
   Some riders were puzzled to find that the new passes looked
identical to the pay-per-ride Metrocards. ``I expected something
different,'' Sharon Allen, 38, of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, said at
the Atlantic Avenue station. ``I don't know quite what, but just
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite appearances, the new passes and the pay-per-ride
Metrocards are not interchangeable. Another token clerk at the 42nd
Street station said several riders were disappointed when told they
could not take their existing pay-per-ride Metrocard and simply add
enough value to it to turn it into an unlimited pass.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some of the bugs in the system were made more annoying by a
feature that makes it impossible to use the pass twice within 18
minutes, an electronic barrier to keep people from swiping other
passengers through at no extra charge. Last week, the City Council
released a study showing that many Metrocard users who were unable
to swipe their cards at one turnstile and moved to a different
turnstile found that they had been charged two fares. The
unlimited-ride passes were supposed to eliminate that problem
because they do not charge per ride.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew Albert, chairman of the Transit Riders Council, a
watchdog group, said that if a pass holder swiped at a defective
turnstile, ``it won't deduct a trip, but it will lock you out of
the system for 18 minutes while you watch trains go by.''

SEASONAL SLATE FAILS TO BRING BLOCKBUSTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The sizzle has fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   With more than half of Hollywood's crucial summer season gone,
it's clear there will be no blockbuster movie, no must-see event
that galvanizes the country and jump-starts a studio's gravy train.
</P>
<P>
   The three leading contenders to reach mega-hit status --
``Godzilla,'' ``The X-Files'' and ``Armageddon'' -- have all
significantly underperformed forecasts. And none of the movies set
for release in the next month appears to have a formula that will
attract the wide variety of moviegoers needed to turn a successful
film into a blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Which means the summer's top film could wind up being
Paramount's ``Deep Impact,'' a less flashy version of
``Armageddon.'' After posting the year's biggest opening in early
May with a $41.1 million debut weekend, it has done far better than
expected with grosses now nearing $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Deep Impact'' remains the top summer film, it would be by
far the smallest gross for a summer leader since 1979. Typically,
the year's biggest film is released in the crucial period between
May and July. And of the top two dozen grossers of all time, only
three -- ``Titanic,'' ``Home Alone'' and ``Aladdin'' -- were not
summer films.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on? Analysts say the key factor is that studios
have miscalculated the public's appetite for expensive slam-bang
action films like ``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing is that the big event films just haven't
been cutting the mustard,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the
Reel Source tracking service. ``Audiences seem to be getting too
smart for a lot of the films that Hollywood's putting out. The date
crowd is not going to action films anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry trackers are quick to caution that Hollywood is not
going under just because its highest-profile products are not
performing up to expectations. First of all, the summer has not
seen an out-and-out bomb like last year's ``Speed 2: Cruise
Control,'' which cost $140 million and then grossed under $50
million domestically.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, second-tier films like ``The Truman Show,'' ``Dr.
Dolittle'' and ``Mulan'' have topped expectations and will each
wind up well over $100 million. ``A Perfect Murder,'' ``Hope
Floats,'' ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' and ``The Horse Whisperer''
have performed respectably.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get caught in the hype of the big movies and you start
buying into it,'' said industry tracker Dan Klusmann of the
Independent Marketing Edge. ``For example, there's nothing I could
say to get my mother and my wife to see `Godzilla.' So when you
think about it, $130 million is fantastic for a movie about
Godzilla.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not so fantastic for a franchise. Studios have used
recent blockbuster movies to create a product -- or franchise --
that will continue to generate money long after the movie is in the
video bin. For example, Warner Bros.' ``Batman,'' which generated
$251.1 million in its 1989 release, spurred one blockbuster sequel
(and two not-so-successful sequels) and has been one of the most
popular brands at Warner Bros.' retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even without a blockbuster movie this summer, business
through Sunday is up about $50 million from last summer's
record-setting level, according to Paul Dergarabedian, head of the
Exhibitor Relations tracking service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer's actually been great, even though there's been no
potential $300 million film,'' he said. ``Even `Godzilla' and
`Armageddon' have done solid business, but it seems disappointing
because the expectations were very high. And we still have a lot of
good movies left.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, however, only two films are viewed as having a
realistic chance of topping ``Deep Impact'': Sony's ``Mask of
Zorro,'' due July 17; and DreamWorks' ``Saving Private Ryan,'' out
July 24. Both should crack the $100 million barrier, according to
Bucksbaum.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Mask of Zorro' is probably the only major film left that
appeals to all audiences,'' Bucksbaum said. ``There's action and
romance. It looks a little different from most big summer event
movies, which helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Klusmann believes ``Saving Private Ryan,'' starring Tom Hanks in
Steven Spielberg's re-creation of the World War II D-Day invasion,
could be the summer's salvation. ``My gut feeling is `Saving
Private Ryan' will be huge because it's really a high-quality
film,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders with some positive buzz include this weekend's
two openings, Warner Bros.' ``Lethal Weapon 4'' and DreamWorks'
``Small Soldiers''; 20th Century Fox's comedy ``There's Something
About Mary,'' due out July 15; Universal's ``Baseketball,'' opening
July 31; Miramax's ``Halloween H2O,'' due Aug. 5; Paramount's
``Snake Eyes,'' rolling out Aug. 7; and Warner's ``The Avengers,''
arriving Aug. 14.

 GRIFFEY OUTDUELS McGUIRE IN HOME RUN DERBY  
(sw) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ When the All-Stars come out to shine Tuesday night, the
nation will get a look at the mighty home run swings of Mark
McGwire and Ken Griffey, who squared off in Monday night's home run
derby, with McGwire falling out in the first round with only four
home runs and Griffey winning the whole thing with 19 before a
record Coors Field crowd of 51,231.
</P>
<P>
   That will be enticing enough for most baseball fans. But
interestingly, what will not be on display when the starting
lineups are introduced at sold-out Coors Field is an overabundance
of New York Yankees, the team that has tied the major league record
for the most victories after 81 games, with 61.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the American League Manager Mike Hargrove of the
Cleveland Indians chose the left-hander David Wells as the American
League's starting pitcher on Monday did the Yankees crack the
starting nine. Wells, 11-2 and author of the only perfect game and
no-hitter of the season, will face Greg Maddux, the Atlanta Braves'
Cy Young regular who is quietly dazzling as always with a 12-2 mark
and a 1.54 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's selection of the starting pitchers, and the traditional
announcement of the starting lineups, were newsworthy, of course,
but they were clearly overshadowed by the hoopla surrounding this
evening's All-Star home run derby, with McGwire and Griffey as the
centerpieces in jam-packed Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   The home run derby itself is not new, but it was a highly
anticipated event this year because of the three-way assault that
McGwire, Griffey and Sammy Sosa have launched on Roger Maris'
single-season home run record of 61.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa took himself out of the derby, and Tuesday's game, with
a sore shoulder and Griffey at first had declined to participate in
the derby, citing weariness from having had to play a game on
Sunday night. But after Griffey heard boos from the fans during
Monday's batting practice, he changed his mind. When the five derby
participants from each league were introduced on Monday evening,
there was Griffey, cap on backward, ready to take his swings.
</P>
<P>
   Why did he change his mind?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to get booed,'' he said. ``This is not a time to
get booed, at an All-Star Game. If they want to see me in the home
run competition, that's four million reasons why I did it.'' The
reference to four million had to do with the number of votes
Griffey drew as the top vote-getter in the balloting for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The derby does not count, of course _ and Juan Gonzalez and Greg
Vaughn, like Sosa, also declined to participate _ but Griffey did
everything he could to justify all those votes. After hitting eight
home runs in each of the first two rounds on Monday night, Griffey
then edged Jim Thome of Cleveland, 3-2, in the third and final
round.
</P>
<P>
   As for McGwire, who leads Griffey 37 home runs to 35 in games
that count, there was a ``sorry, everybody,'' for the crowd after
he went out, disappointingly, in the first round. But McGwire did
hit the longest shot in the derby _ a 510-feet blast to center
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the ball middle in, and the pitches were middle away,''
McGwire said afterward by way of explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, there were no Yankees in the home run derby, but
there will at least be three Yankees on the bench when the game
gets under way on Tuesday night. After the fans voted, Hargrove
added several Yankees _ third baseman Scott Brosius, right fielder
Paul O'Neill and shortstop Derek Jeter _ as reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Also picked by Hargrove but unable to attend was center fielder
Bernie Williams, the league's leading hitter, who is currently on
the disabled list. Of the Yankees eventually selected only Jeter
finished second in voting at his position, but he trailed Seattle's
Alex Rodriguez by nearly a million votes.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove, the manager left to fill out the roster, was not
initially thinking about the Yankees on Monday. Not when he was
busy explaining why he selected his own shortstop, Omar Vizquel,
over Boston's Nomar Garciaparra or why he hesitated before turning
center field over to the Gold Glover Griffey and moving his own
center fielder, Kenny Lofton, to left.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the absence of pinstriped starters from the Bronx finally
struck home with Hargrove during a day of interviews, contests and
starry-eyed hyperbole on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I surprised? I guess maybe a little bit,'' said Hargrove,
``because the Yankees have maybe the best following around the
country, if not the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think instead of it being a knock against the Yankees,
and the players, I think it is a big compliment in how well
rounded, how well balanced, their team is.''

CNN EMPLOYEES POINTEDLY ASK HOW MANAGERS ESCAPED PURGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hundreds of angry Cable News Network staff members in the
network's Atlanta headquarters and more calling in from CNN's
bureaus around the world took part in two meetings on Monday at
which some demanded to know why the network's top managers stayed
on the job after last week's apology and repudiation of its report
that the American military had used nerve gas on a 1970 mission in
Laos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom Johnson, the chairman of CNN News Group, told the group that
his offer of resignation had twice been rejected by Gerald Levin,
the chairman of Time Warner, the network's corporate parent, and
Ted Turner, the founder of CNN and now vice chairman of Time
Warner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some producers and correspondents asked why Richard Kaplan, the
chairman of CNN/USA, and Peter Arnett, the correspondent who
narated the report, had not chosen or been forced to resign. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in an interview on Monday night a spokesman for the network,
who insisted on anonymity, said, ``Peter Arnett's role as a
correspondent in the Operation Tailwind coverage is being
re-evaluated based on new information provided to Tom Johnson over
the weekend and on Monday.'' The military mission examined by the
report had been code-named Operation Tailwind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The network's top executives had believed that Arnett conducted
just one interview for the program, the spokesman said, but have
since learned that he conducted two others, including one with a
pilot on the mission who said his aircraft had been loaded with
tear gas, not nerve gas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Arnett said in recent interviews that he was a late
addition to the reporting team and basically read a script, in an
interview on Monday night, in response to the spokesman's comment,
he said it had been widely known that he had conducted three
interviews, not one, including one with the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   In the second of two meetings on Monday, Arnett called from
Oregon, where he was vacationing. He spoke for five minutes, saying
he had been filing numerous reports from Baghdad while the
Operation Tailwind story was being prepared and by the time he got
involved its basic thrust was established.
</P>
<P>
   To the accusation that he had sullied the network's reputation,
he said his work over 17 years had helped establish the network's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   An article on the same incident appeared in Time magazine under
the bylines of April Oliver, who was the main producer of the CNN
report, and Arnett. Like CNN, its corporate cousin in Time Warner,
Time retracted the report and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson reprimanded Arnett on Thursday. Ms. Oliver and her
senior producer, Jack Smith, were dismissed by the network on
Friday when they refused to resign. Pamela Hill, the senior
executive producer of ``Newsstand: CNN &AMP; Time,'' the program which
broadcast the report on June 7, resigned on Thursday after
accepting the conclusions of an outside investigation that the
central charges in the report were not substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meetings involved ``A very vigorous discussion,'' said
CNN's Washington bureau chief, Frank Sesno. ``There were several
bold exchanges that raised the question of what this means in the
most profound way to CNN and who is responsible for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Three people who participated in the meeting said CNN
journalists brought up some of the controversial news decisions
over which Kaplan had presided at ABC News before joining CNN last
summer, including the investigative report of food-handling
practices at the Food Lion supermarket chain. That report, in which
ABC employees lied to get jobs at a Food Lion store, brought the
network a fraud conviction in state court, a verdict that is on
appeal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday he defended ABC's performance in that report and said
he had not offered to resign from CNN because he did not want to
appear to be a quitter, two participants in the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone on Monday night, Johnson said: ``I
apologized to the 3,500 women and men of CNN. I accepted
responsibility for the mistake _ well, maybe it is best described
as a fiasco.'' He told those at the meetings that a new special
unit, headed by a vice president, would check special reports
produced for the network's growing stable of newsmagazine programs.

AMERICA'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH KWAN CONTINUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sometimes well-wishers will approach, says
Michelle Kwan, and simply burst into tears before they can get a
word out.
</P>
<P>
   And an usual phenomenon continues: Wizened adults still have
much more difficulty dealing with Kwan's unrealized hopes at the
1998 Winter Olympics than does this diminutive figure skater. She
turns 18 today, but her maturity and sportsmanship have so belied
her years that she's become something of a marvel in the sports
world.
</P>
<P>
   And out of it. Imagine two American skaters finishing 1-2 at an
Olympics and the silver medalist emerging as the more popular of
the two. Unthinkable. And yet that seems to be reality to date.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Lipinski, who won the gold in Nagano, Japan, gushed and
giggled, turned pro at age 15, and was about as embraceable as a
lottery winner.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, the prohibitive favorite going into the Games, held her
head high, spoke graciously and made not a single excuse _ although
she would have been fully warranted to cite at least two. Since
then, a wave of public and corporate appreciation has cascaded over
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, if anything, she came out of Nagano and was held in
higher regard by people,'' said Kwan's manager, Shep Goldberg,
``because I think they found out a lot more about what kind of
person she is and how she does handle adversity and her outlook on
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, everyone knew of her as a skater, but I think this
certainly humanized her.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, who has been cheered warmly on an exhibition skating tour
that will make three stops in Southern California in the next few
days, seems grateful for her heightened popularity in the aftermath
of Nagano. But it's clear her reaction to the silver-medal finish
emanated from her core and wasn't some carefully calculated
response to elicit approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was part of my upbringing,'' Kwan said recently over lunch
at an airport hotel, her mother at her elbow. ``What my parents
taught me was to do my best. And whether you win or lose, respect
the sport. Life has no guarantees. As a general rule, treat others
as you would like to be treated.''
</P>
<P>
   As for refusing to wallow in the despair of an unfulfilled
dream, Kwan said, ``I think it really does speak for itself. It's,
`OK, let's do something else. Let's go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And on she has gone. There is the current tour, Champions on
Ice, which stops at the Long Beach Arena on Thursday, the Anaheim
Pond on Friday and the Sports Arena on Sunday. Later this summer,
she will participate in the Goodwill Games in Long Island and also
complete her independent studies and graduate from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, who has won two world championships and two national
titles, announced shortly after the Olympics she would continue to
compete as an amateur (although relaxed rules enable her to pull
down a healthy living in exhibitions), and aim, at least for now,
for a return to the Olympics in 2002 at Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Her commercial opportunities have also exploded, such that she
appears to be in more demand than Lipinski. There is a deal with
Disney for a series of televised specials, some product
endorsements and, according to Goldberg, discussions under way on
unspecified movie projects.
</P>
<P>
   She's also having fun. Kwan, who dropped out of school in
Torrance in the eighth grade so as to devote her full energies to
competitive skating, seems to be making up for lost teen time.
</P>
<P>
   While throwing a nervous glance toward her mother, she tells of
the time on tour recently when the skaters were careening down
infamous Lombard Street in San Francisco in a car driven by bronze
medalist Philippe Candeloro of France. There was also the
whitewater rafting excursion in Boise, Idaho, and the seaplane tour
of the wilds of Alaska. After this lunch, she was positively giddy
about the prospect of driving her car _ clear to LAX, a distance of
about a mile.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan has also toured Harvard and is weighing the prospect of
balancing college with her heavy skating schedule. ``I'm taking
things slowly because I want to make the right decision,'' she
said. ``It's important to pursue education. If I can stall it for a
year or two, fine, but I want to be the same age as everyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good bet, however, she will be a triple-toe leap ahead of
her contemporaries when it comes to poise and perspective.
</P>
<P>
   What happened at Nagano, strangely, was entirely if unwittingly
set up by Kwan herself. By delivering a dazzling, unprecedented
performance at the U.S. championships in Philadelphia just one
month before the Olympics _ getting perfect 6.0 scores on 15 of 18
marks _ she set a personal standard that proved improbably high.
When she dipped just slightly below that standard at Nagano while
Lipinski spun like an airborne top, the result was second place.
</P>
<P>
   The judges appeared to deem the performance just short of Kwan's
level. And, well... ``For me, it was a little short, too,'' said
Kwan. ``Just a hair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My best performance ever was Philadelphia.'' Her eyes brighten
to a sparkle. ``I'll always remember that one.... Usually, you're
like, `(Sigh), Oh, it's over.' This time, it was, `Oh, I don't want
it ever to end.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Estella, interjects: ``Michelle got a card from a
lady that saw one of the shows in San Francisco. She said, `I'm 90
years old. I can't remember my name sometimes. But I'll always
remember the performance you did in Philadelphia. I'm looking for
the next one, too.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There was to be no duplication of the performance at the
Olympics. Kwan never said a word about it until weeks after the
Games. But she was bothered throughout the competition by a stress
fracture in her left foot, a problem that had plagued her on and
off for months (and put her in a cast at the end of '97).
</P>
<P>
   She also had cause at least to question the judging, but she
didn't. The international skating community has been vowing for
some time it would not reward acrobatic jumping at the expense of
the balletic beauty of the sport. But in the '98 Games, this proved
to be lip service. Kwan presented her trademark artistry in her
free skate, but, as usual, produced no jump more daring than a
triple-double. Lipinski, landing five triple-triples, won over six
of the nine judges.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this, Kwan smiled impishly and said, ``Well, I've
already planned that I'm going to do a (quadruple jump).''
</P>
<P>
   She laughed, then turned serious: ``I don't want to be lacking
of something. I don't want the judges to have an excuse to put me
where they want to put me. That's why you have to improve. You have
to keep on improving. I think I can improve my technical side. I
can do those triple-triples....
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very subjective sport. There are a lot of opinions and
no facts, because there's no timer, there's no (measuring) how high
you can jump. Maybe one judge is looking for triple-triples,
another one is appreciating the grace and artistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started skating, I knew it was like this and I didn't
mind. And I still don't mind. You have to be a well-rounded
skater.''
</P>
<P>
   No complaints. No excuses. No cries of injustice. Just an
acknowledgement of the conditions, a determination to give the
judges everything they might require. And, all the while, a sincere
expression of pride in the silver medal, the winning of which was
no small feat.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder they cheer so enthusiastically for Michelle Kwan.

GRIFFEY DOES RIGHT THING IN RESPONSE TO COORS BOO-BIRDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Sheesh. The way people were starting to act, it looked
as if Ken Griffey Jr. ranked somewhere between Attila the Hun and
Seinfeld's resident persona non grata, Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, those loud boos you heard wafting over the Rockies and
Cascades Monday afternoon were for Griffey _ before he did the
right thing.
</P>
<P>
   When baseball's most popular player stepped into the batters box
for a pre-All-Star Game workout, baseball fans at Coors Field let
Griffey have it, big-time.
</P>
<P>
   See, Griffey said he was going to skip the crown jewel of the
All-Star Game festivities _ the home run derby _ and suddenly he's
the worst thing that ever happened to the youth of America since
Ronald Reagan's regime deemed ketchup a school lunch vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, bad for your health. Griffey, bad for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   No one cheered, either, when Griffey reached into the stands and
personally handed his double-dipped, black lacquered Louisville
Slugger to one very amazed and happy boy.
</P>
<P>
   It's true there's a thin line between love and hate. Sports
stars and sports fans seem to live out this basic human truth in
wildly dramatic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   And Griffey, for all his growing up so gifted and so squarely in
the glaring spotlight, does not seem to mind straddling that
precarious line, even when he knows everything he says and does is
magnified times 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Griffey spent his All-Star Game confounding baseball
fans and observers by clamoring for more respect _ odd mostly
because there is no other baseball star more universally held in
awe.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Griffey undertook another quirky experiment in
group psychology. For a month, up until minutes before the home run
derby, Griffey steadfastly denied he would take part.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Griffey was holding a protest against Players' Union
representative Gene Orza, who all but insulted Griffey at the last
All-Star Game. Secondly, Griffey is frustrated with the baseball
schedule-makers, who have the Mariners traveling 70,000 miles in
six months with only three days off at home all season, with too
many day games that follow night games and other schedule grinds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been called a spoiled brat, a punk and everything else,
and I don't think I deserve it,'' Griffey said yesterday, launching
a defense of his no-derby stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to do one thing and I become a villain,'' said
the American League's reigning MVP and the leading All-Star
vote-getter.
</P>
<P>
   Well, even Griffey _ maybe especially Griffey _ understands
baseball does not need any villains. That's ultimately why he
undecided to skip the derby, which meant that Griffey _ who also
straddles the line between tradition and new-generation baseball
like no other major leaguer today _ ultimately does the right
thing.
</P>
<P>
   When they announced his participation just as the derby was
about to get started, Griffey drew the adulation of the Coors Field
crowd. From boos to cheers, just like that. That's the paper-thin
line of sports passion. Love and hate, so close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to be booed. This is not a time to be booed, not
at the All-Star Game. If the fans wanted me to try, there's four
million reason why I should. I did it for them,'' Griffey said
after winning the whole darn thing, as Mark McGwire and Jim Thome
went for distance and Griffey just tried to do his best.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the pressure is on the game's biggest stars to
deliver the goods, to keep the love flowing. And it's a good
pressure, mostly. From Cub rookie Kerry Woods' 20 strikeouts in a
single game to Juan Gonzalez's 101-pre-All-Star RBI assault on Hack
Wilson's record to Sammy Sosa's record 20 dingers in the month of
June, the players are eating up the opportunities to take on
history, maybe even to make history.
</P>
<P>
   By all measure here in the rare air of Denver, baseball has to
understand it has gotten a huge break.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after baseball's ugly strike, the unsavory image of
union boss Donald Fehr and commissioner Bud Selig is about all the
villain baseball can sustain. The image of that ugly standoff grows
ever distant, especially now that Selig is calling 1998 a
``renaissance'' season as attendance and interest are again
flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   And with Griffey's 35 homers so far this season and McGwire's 37
and Sosa's 33, there is no lack of punch and box-office draw to the
game formerly known as the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   That's ultimately why Griffey had to relent and join in the home
run derby. Maybe the boos made him think twice. Maybe he always
intended to participate. Maybe the words of Hall of Famers Frank
Robinson and Joe Morgan worked on him.
</P>
<P>
   While he has a knack for confounding behavior, Griffey
understands as clearly as anyone that in the big picture there is
still so much baseball must do to reach out and grow and evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Griffey lamented the fact that rocket-throwing Woods
was left off the National League roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all he's done this year, he deserves to be here,''
Griffey said. ``I didn't say I wanted to face him, but he should be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why Griffey thinks the All-Star rosters should be
expanded, to give more deserving players a chance. And, as always,
Griffey is adamant that baseball should do more to market the
players and the game to appeal to a new generation of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Is baseball on its way back?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' Griffey said. ``I think it is. I think the things
going on, with McGwire and Woods and David Wells' no-hitter and
Sammy, these are things we need. Hopefully, it's something we can
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Like baseball itself, sometimes Griffey's path and rationale are
a little convoluted. Ultimately, we have come to learn, he does the
right thing, homers and all.

ALL-STARS READY FOR TAKEOFF TUESDAY NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ With this being the year of the home run in the major
leagues, you couldn't find a more suitable location than Coors
Field for the game's most powerful sluggers to put on a show.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs are hit here more often than any other big-league
stadium, giving Tuesday night's 69th All-Star Game the potential of
becoming the highest scoring Midsummer Classic in history.
</P>
<P>
   The record is 20 runs, scored on July 13, 1954, in Cleveland,
when the AL won, 11-9. But the air is thinner here. The muscles are
bigger. And the timing is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the homers flying out of the yard, it's kind of weird
that we're in home run heaven,'' San Diego Padres outfielder Tony
Gwynn said during Monday's National League workout. ``If you're a
home run hitter, you've got to love playing here.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't even have to be a home run hitter to think long-ball.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mariner shortstop Omar Vizquel walked into the visiting
clubhouse Monday, holding a video camera and dreaming of reaching
the seats for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't hit one yet, but I can't think of a better place to
do it,'' the first-time All-Star said. ``I've never played a game
here, but I hear that the ball travels pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   And often.
</P>
<P>
   Through June 30, there were 856 home runs hit here since Coors
Field opened for the 1995 season. That is 105 more than teams have
hit at the Kingdome over the same span.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was the hitting coach (for the Rockies) for two years
and he always told me you don't have to swing very hard for the
ball to go out here,'' Ken Griffey Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   According to scientists, a ball hit 400 feet at sea level will
travel 440 feet in Denver's mile-high altitude. One of Mark
McGwire's best bolts Tuesdat night might wind up in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about managing his first game at Coors Field, AL
manager Mike Hargrove said, ``You get a dart board and darts and
start firing them at the wall. Anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I managed for a year in Colorado Springs so I'm a little bit
familiar with how well the balls travels in this part of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   So does National League starter Greg Maddux of the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to compare pitching in Coors Field to anywhere else,
Maddux said, ``Well, I mean, obviously, you know, your slider
doesn't slide as much and your curves don't curve as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can still pitch here, as long as you keep the ball
down.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wells, the AL starting pitcher and the Yankees'
perfect-game star, said he isn't intimidated by the ballpark,
McGwire or anything else for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a challenge and I enjoy challenges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the odds favor a hitter's game.
</P>
<P>
   Wells is 11-2 with a 3.75 ERA. He joked that his principal
strategy Tuesday night will be to duck. ``I have a vision of a
high-scoring game, but hopefully not when I'm in there.''
</P>
<P>
   There are four players on the teams who have hit at least 30
homers this season: McGwire (37), Griffey (35), Sammy Sosa (33) and
Greg Vaughn (30). Sosa, however, won't play because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who like their games on the 12-10 side have come to the
right place. Coors Field led all major-league parks in runs per
game, homers per at-bat and batting average from 1995-97, according
to Stats Inc. That's not only a reflection of Denver's mile-high
air. Since the ball carries so well and outfielders play so deep,
there's more room for singles to fall in front of them and doubles
to reach the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   A well-pitched, tightly played game _ which is unlikely _ could
go a long way toward dispelling Coors Field's image as a launching
pad. When Chicago Cubs first baseman Mark Grace christened the park
``Williamsport'' _ in reference to the Little League World Series
site in Pennsylvania _ it wasn't because of the ambience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best park in the National League to hit in, for
sure,'' said Rockies outfielder Dante Bichette. ``But I think the
reputation is a little bit exaggerated. Hopefully everybody will
see a well-played game and it won't add to the park's mystique _ or
whatever you want to call it.''

BOOS LIGHT GRIFFEY'S FIRE IN HOME RUN DERBY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Ken Griffey Jr. insisted for more than a month that the
All-Star Home Run Derby would have to go on without him. No way, no
thanks, no chance of changing his mind.
</P>
<P>
   A loud crowd at Coors Field on Monday changed it for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to get booed. I don't think anybody does,'' the
Mariner center fielder said after not only competing in the derby
but winning it. ``This is not a time to get booed, the All-Star
Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, you know, if they want to see me in the home run
competition, the fans, that's the reason why I did it. For them.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey was the overwhelmingly least-favorite All-Star
introduced during Monday's American League workout. He stepped into
the batting cage and the fans let him know they weren't happy about
him refusing to compete in what has become the glamor event of the
Mid-Summer Classic.
</P>
<P>
   American League home run leader vs. National League home run
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey versus Mark McGwire, man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   Although McGwire, of the St. Louis Cardinals, hit the longest
home run _ 510 feet _ Griffey hit the most, beating Cleveland
Indians first baseman Jim Thome in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Each slugger had five outs in the finals. Thome, batting first,
hit two into the seats. Griffey, cap turned backwards, stepped in
and sent three batting practice pitches into the bleachers with two
outs to spare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew two wasn't going to be enough to beat Junior,'' Thome
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same fans who booed Griffey, stood and cheered him.
</P>
<P>
   As Griffey talked to the media at his locker, Hall of Famer Joe
Morgan stuck his head through the gathering and said, ``I'm proud
of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so much for winning a second derby title, but competing.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, an ESPN baseball analyst, had spoken to Griffey in
Arlington, Texas, Sunday night and reminded him that he was the
most popular player in the game _ as evidenced by his major
league-leading 4 million All-Star votes.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, Hall of Famer Frank Robinson talked to Griffey about
half an hour before the derby started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to the guys with those types of numbers and
credentials,'' Griffey said. ``You know, you don't know everything.
This is my 10th year in the big leagues and I'm still learning.''
</P>
<P>
   After the boos and batting practice, several of Griffey's AL
All-Star teammates offered encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the boos are the reason he changed his mind,'' said
Mariner shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who hit five homers and failed to
get to the second round. ``And as only Junior can do, he put on a
show.''
</P>
<P>
   The five AL participants already had been selected by the time
Griffey changed his mind. Damion Easley of the Tigers; Rafael
Palmeiro of the Orioles; Rodriguez, Thome and Darin Erstad of the
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad and Griffey talked. Erstad watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ended up making the final decision,'' Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   He stood on the dugout steps holding a bat. After local favorite
Vinny Castilla, the Rockies' only All-Star was introduced, Griffey
stepped down and then walked up the dugout steps to be introduced
to a mixture of cheers and boos.
</P>
<P>
   The cheers grew louder as Griffey pounded eight batting practice
pitches into the seats, guaranteeing him a spot in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire didn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   The major league's leading home run hitter with 37 settled for
four homers in the first round. ``I'm sorry, everybody,'' he told
the capacity crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to see how far Mark could hit the ball,'' Griffey
said. ``They will remember the one (510 feet) he hit more than the
number of homers I hit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Griffey said he was glad he changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to win, but it was fun.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TWO VOTES FOR MCGUIRE TO HIT 62 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, re-editing throughout) (sw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   DENVER _ The numbers change, but for a day or two or sometimes
an at-bat or two, each number is part of their name. The names and
numbers now are Mark McGwire 37, Ken Griffey Jr. 35, Sammy Sosa 33.
</P>
<P>
   For most home run hitters, any of those numbers is a good
season. But as McGwire, Griffey and Sosa gathered for Tuesday
night's All-Star Game, each has a realistic chance to surpass the
name and number that defines home run history for one season: Roger
Maris 61.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire needs only 25 more to break the record, Griffey only 27,
Sosa only 29.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sosa, the Cubs' 29-year-old right fielder, was asked on
Monday which had the best opportunity to break Maris' record, he
never hesitated even with Griffey sitting next to him in the Coors
Field interview room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my money on Mark McGwire,'' Sosa said. ``Griffey, I
know you my boy, but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey laughed. Sosa continued in his Dominican-accented
English, saying: ``We have another second half to go. Who knows? I
might be the one, Griffey might be the one, or Mark.'' But with a
smile, Griffey agreed that McGwire had the best chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bigger,'' the Mariners' center fielder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that Griffey swing, that's something that's natural,''
Sosa said. ``He don't try to hit a home run, just an easy swing,
make contact. Myself, I'm crazy. I'm swinging the bat all the way.
If I'm not swinging the bat hard, I think I'm cheating myself.
Mark, he is so big, he swing so easy. I don't think he go out there
trying to swing hard to hit a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   This was before the home run derby that Griffey, who changed his
mind about competing after being booed, won with a total of 19 over
three rounds. Although McGwire hit only four, he hit the longest, a
510-foot moon shot to center. Sosa was scratched with a sore
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just enjoy it,'' McGwire had said earlier of the home run
derby. ``Why guys are backing out, I'm sure they all have their own
reasons, but I enjoy it. It's something I do. It's something that
I've accepted that I am.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit 58 last season, including 24 after being traded to
the Cardinals from Oakland on July 31. He hit 52 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprisingly,'' the 6-foot-5-inch 250-pound first baseman
said, ``some of the longer ones I've hit, I didn't realize they
were going that far because a lot of people say, `What's the
feeling?' Actually there's really no feeling at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when the ball meets the bat that it's left the ball
park. My swing is nice and easy, short and compact. It's really
effortless. Because of that, there's really not that hard feeling
that I think some players have. It's a nice, easy thing.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire minimized the theory that his back problems threaten his
chance to hit 62, if not 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take away 1993 and 1994 where I missed all those games,
I've basically averaged 150 games a year,'' he said, alluding to
the heel ailment that put him on the disabled list. ``Everybody
gets injured in this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play six months of the year. No other sport does that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play through the hottest time of the year. I've had a bad
back since 1989. It's something I have to deal with. I swing a bat
probably 100,000 times a year.''
</P>
<P>
   But he believes that missing all those games in 1993 and 1994
made him a better player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time since I was a Little Leaguer that I had
to sit on the bench and watch a game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time that I really started watching pitchers
pitch to hitters. I started watching tapes on how they pitched me.
I started watching hitters, how they approached other pitchers.
When I came back, I started adapting that to my game.''
</P>
<P>
   And almost every day now, McGwire sees himself linked to Babe
Ruth, who hit 60 homers in 1927, and Maris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering that when I was a kid and all I wanted to do was
pitch, it wasn't until my sophomore year in college that I turned
into a hitter, never knowing if I'd get a chance to go to the big
leagues,'' he said, alluding to the University of Southern
California. ``The next thing you now, they're talking about my name
along with Babe Ruth, Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle. It's
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's that Mark McGwire hits baseballs over walls. Maybe, in
one season, like nobody else ever has.

WARM HEARTS, COLD SHOULDERS FOR 2 PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ It happens every July, Major League Baseball charges
into its summer blockbuster with a rush. Baseball's All-Star Game
has become the game's mid-season showcase event.
</P>
<P>
   For the 69th time, the American and National Leagues will get
together to decide which is the dominant league. The usual story
lines are all in place _ the game's great sluggers facing the best
of today's pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   But there is so much more to this year's event. Coors Field is
awash with two of the most compelling stories of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, there's Atlanta shortstop Walt Weiss, whose
three-year-old son, Brody, appears to have successfully fought off
a potentially lethal strand of E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, there's New York Mets pitcher Rick Reed, who
has become the first replacement player to reach the game's
pinnacle, at least on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   Both Weiss and Reed are All-Stars for the first time in their
careers. Both have interesting subplots that stem from
circumstances away from the field.
</P>
<P>
   In Reed's case, it was almost painful to watch the way most of
his NL All-Star teammates ostracized him before, during and after
Monday's workout. In Weiss' case, there is universal support for
his son and family.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every player became emotional when discussing what the
Weisses have gone through since Brody contracted the virus while
playing in contaminated pool water at an Atlanta theme park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked up to him today and said, `Look, I've never really
met you, but my family has said prayers for you,' '' Yankees
outfielder Paul O'Neill said. ``I know he has a lot of faith, and I
think that's helped him tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Atlanta teammate Javier Lopez: ``You see his face and how
happy he is, but that's not because he's at the All-Star Game. It's
because his son is better. It affected all of us. He's been
amazing. He's never lost faith, which is the biggest thing he's
shown all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Before signing with the Braves last winter, Weiss played three
seasons for the Colorado Rockies, where owner Jerry McMorris found
a special place in his heart for the slick-fielding shortstop, who
is almost universally considered one of the most decent humans in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   McMorris was so overcome with joy from Brody's release from an
Atlanta-area hospital last week that he sent his private jet to
Georgia to pick up the Weiss family. Doctors did not want Brody to
fly commercially until his immune system had a chance to strengthen
itself further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I couldn't thank him (McMorris) enough,'' said
Weiss, who still makes his off-season home in the Denver suburb of
Aurora. ``It shows it was more than a player-management
relationship when I was here. The way people have reached out to us
is beyond belief. It just blows me away.''
</P>
<P>
   Brody will attend the All-Star Game tonight and sit inside
McMorris' private box. Weiss will always remember his first
All-Star Game. But not because he finally made it after 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outpouring of support has been nothing short of amazing,''
Weiss said. ``You wouldn't believe the stacks of cards, letters and
stuffed animals we've received, most of them from Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Weiss story apparently will have a happy ending, it's
uncertain which way Reed's will wind up. One thing was certain from
Monday's workout: The resentment toward players who crossed
baseball's picket line back in the spring of 1995 still exists.
</P>
<P>
   After entering the NL clubhouse, Reed made his way to his
cubicle, dressed and started up on a crossword puzzle. Only a
handful of NL All-Stars said anything to Reed, who mostly sat
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say less than half have said anything to me,'' Reed
said. ``Crossing the picket line was something I felt I had to do.
Looking back at it, I would never have done it now. But it's too
late for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough time. It really was. I guess I stepped on some
toes. I was pacing in my room before coming here today. It wasn't
that tough walking into the clubhouse. It was much tougher getting
on the bus with all the players on it.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Atlanta's four-time Cy Young Award winner, Greg
Maddux, walked up to Reed and asked him to sign a baseball signed
by the other NL All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks,'' Maddux said. ``And, congratulations.''
</P>
<P>
   It was simple, yet it meant so much to Reed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the very first time we've ever talked,'' Reed said.
``That makes it all worth while.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the hard feelings were obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a guy crosses a picket line in baseball, that's just the
way it is,'' said Colorado Manager Don Baylor. ``Maybe in time that
might change. But I'd say it's a slim maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Home Run Derby, when the NL players stood on the
first base dugout rail, Reed was down at the end, flanked by a pair
of Rockies' grounds crew workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to comment on it,'' said Philadelphia's Curt
Schilling. ``It's the All-Star Game. I'm here to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others seemed more willing to welcome Reed back into good
graces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he feels uncomfortable,'' San Diego's Tony Gwynn
said. ``But what's done is done. I went up and congratulated him.
He's a big part of why the Mets are succeeding. He's earned his way
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mark McGwire: ``That's long in the past. It was too long
ago to continue dwelling on it.''
</P>
<P>
   One game, two vastly different sides of baseball sharing the
All-Star stage. &QL;

Ex-Marlins dominate pre-game discussion
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DENVER _ It was just like old times.
</P>
<P>
   On a couch in the National League clubhouse, Moises Alou, Devon
White and Gary Sheffield _ all integral parts of the Florida
Marlins' title run last season _ were reunited with former manager
Jim Leyland.
</P>
<P>
   They rekindled World Series memories. Mostly, though, they
caught up on a hectic last few months that saw a near complete
dismantling of the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   A few lockers away, a couple more ex-teammates _ Kevin Brown and
Robb Nen _ answered questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Marlins were together again, if only for a few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Five players.
</P>
<P>
   Five different uniforms. And that's just part of the story. In
all, 16 members of the 1997 World Series champions are with 10
different teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they wanted to defend,'' Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn
said. ''Look at the number of ex-Marlins in here. They would have
had a pretty good chance of doing that because they had a quality
club. ``That's done. They're all spread out.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the former Marlins, no player has contributed more to his
team's success than Alou, whom the Astros acquired last November.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series magic has yet to wear off for Alou, whose 20
home runs and 73 RBIs earned him a third All-Star selection. None
of it comes as a shock to his former coaches and teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big-game player. He wants to be there in the big
game,'' Marlins coach Bruce Kimm said. ``He wants to go out there
every day and if he doesn't beat you with his bat, he'll beat you
with the glove. He's an all-around player. He's definitely one of
the best players in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the occasion, he'll rise to it. In a big game, if you
had to have somebody at the plate, I'll take him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He meant a lot to us,'' said Nen, now the Giants' closer. ``He
had a great year and he's doing the same thing this year for the
Astros.''
</P>
<P>
   In Game 5 of the World Series, Alou delivered a three-run homer
in the sixth inning and later added an RBI single as the Marlins
beat Cleveland 8-7. Alou hit .321 with three homers, nine RBIs and
six runs in the seven-game triumph over the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Mike Hargrove, manager of the AL All-Star team, had
an idea of what to expect from Alou before last year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew going into that he had a reputation as a big-game
player,'' Hargrove said. ``He did nothing to dispel that. We knew
in the World Series he was going to be a big out for us, that we
didn't need to let him beat us. For the most part we were able to
succeed with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only so much you can do and eventually a hitter like
that is going to step up and burn you.''
</P>
<P>
   What has made Alou even better, some players say, is his
insertion into a lineup of heavy hitters, similar to when he was
with the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest thing is that he didn't have to shoulder
the load by himself,'' Gwynn said. ``They had good players to begin
with. All he is is another piece to the puzzle, just like some of
these other guys are with other clubs. He has made them a much
better ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said of his former teammates on the NL All-Star
squad:
</P>
<P>
   Brown is 10-3 with a 2.67 ERA for the NL West-leading San Diego
Padres, including a 7-0 mark in his last eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   Nen, a first-time All-Star, is tied for the league lead with 25
saves for the Giants, who lead the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers have struggled but Sheffield has been
impressive since being traded in the blockbuster deal for Mike
Piazza in May. He is batting .327 with eight home runs and 32 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   White is arguably the best player for the expansion Arizona
Diamondbacks, owners of the worst record in the major leagues. The
three-time All-Star is hitting .292 with 13 homers and 49 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Edgar Renteria is the only member of the 1997 Marlins
still playing in Florida. He will appear in his first All-Star Game
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland said there was no conspiracy to reunite his old players.
They will play tonight because of their accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, there was no plan behind it (the selections),''
Leyland said. ``It just tells you what an outstanding baseball team
we had last year. I'll leave it at that.''

POWER FOR THE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER - There is no ambiguity over the crack of a bat, no
ambivalence when a ball sails into the street.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone understands force. Everyone is intoxicated by power.
And no one can turn away when records start quivering in fear.
</P>
<P>
   They said baseball was past its time, no longer hip, an
antiquated sport that couldn't possibly appeal to a generation
weaned on Michael Jordan and the X Games. But here you are, touched
by the sluggers, romanced by the most awe-inspiring moment in
sports:
</P>
<P>
   The home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most difficult thing to do in sports today,'' Mark
McGwire said. ``To hit a round ball with a round bat squarely, to
get it to go a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-Stars will take the field today, but the reason for
baseball's renaissance was on display Monday, a few rounds of
missile-launching pinball that served as a microcosm for the first
half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN hyped the event like the Super Bowl, knowing that last
year's Home Run Derby produced a 5.7 rating, higher than any of its
programming outside the NFL. Ken Griffey Jr., who spent the
afternoon explaining why he wouldn't partake in the contest, came
to his senses and realized the importance of the moment. And when
McGwire failed to make the cut, the biggest freak of them all
apologized to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   This was a meaningless exhibition, but it was wonderfully
symbolic, for there is giddy apprehension just around the corner.
Soon, the chase will get serious. And if Roger Maris is snuffed out
after 37 years on the throne, baseball will dominate the landscape
in a way few thought possible at the start of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has accepted the firestorm of attention and is
threatening to make a mockery of the record. Although strangely
indifferent, Griffey can spend the rest of the season swinging for
the fences. And the attention-craving Sammy Sosa is just the type
to enjoy the hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to be on television everyday, but if they ask, I
will be there,'' Sosa said. ``You have to be strong mentally to do
it, and right now, I think I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the climate is perfect. When Maris bopped 61
homers in 1961, he lost clumps of hair and developed a rash on his
face. The sentiment was against him, and the commissioner felt it
necessary to attach an asterisk to his feat, noting the schedule
had been lengthened by eight games since Babe Ruth smashed 60.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you don't care if the pitching is diluted, if the ball is
juiced or if creatine is turning the game into batting practice.
You want to see history, even if it means abandoning all loyalty
when the candidates come to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I want to go like this,'' said McGwire, motioning
like a quarterback requesting silence. ``The guy on the mound is
trying his best to get me out. He throws one or two balls and the
stands are booing. It's another thing that has been so overwhelming
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, it is wonderful for the game that the men chasing
Maris represent different ethnic backgrounds. And all three have
unique opportunities: Sosa has Wrigley Field. Griffey has the
perfect swing. And if McGwire stays healthy, he could do the record
justice, besting it in fewer than 154 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until my sophomore year in college that I turned
into a hitter, never knowing I'd ever get a chance to go to the big
leagues,'' McGwire said. ``The next thing you know, they're taking
about my name along with Babe Ruth, Maris, Mantle. It's
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the homestretch is beckoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my money on Mark McGwire,'' Sosa said, turning
sheepishly toward his friend. ``Griffey, I know you're my boy, but
. . . ''
</P>
<P>
   So they said the game was too long, too slow, a rocking chair in
the high-tech den of athletics. But now you're watching the
rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, and suddenly,
baseball is hot.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time in a long time, definitely cool. &QL;

Griffey takes Home Run Derby
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DENVER _ The rarefied air of Coors Field, a defenseless batting
practice pitcher and an oversized redhead named Mark McGwire didn't
appear to be a very good combination for anyone else hoping to win
Monday's Home Run Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your upsets.
</P>
<P>
   In the year of the home run, the man who has done more for the
cause than anyone else was just ordinary. McGwire, who hit 37
homers in the first half of the season and is on pace to set a
single-season record with 70, pumped just four out of Coors Field
during Monday's contest _ and was eliminated after the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd at Coors Field must have felt like the
Griswalds in National Lampoon's Vacation after the family drove
across country to visit an amusement park that was closed for
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   There might as well have been an ``out of order'' sign hanging
around McGwire's neck as he sat near the dugout and watched Jim
Thome and last-minute entry Ken Griffey Jr. battle for the award he
was supposed to win.
</P>
<P>
   This was the most anticipated Home Run Derby since the event was
added, and no one had to tell McGwire who the fans expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, everyone,'' McGwire said during an on-field interview
that could be heard over the public-address system.
</P>
<P>
   The Coors Field gathering owed Griffey an apology after the
long-ball display he treated them to.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who won the event for the third time, was booed when he
accepted his award as the top vote-getter in fan balloting. The
fans were disappointed because Griffey had announced he wouldn't
participate in the Home Run Derby. The negative reaction lit a fire
under Griffey and spurred him to 19 homers in the three-round
competition.
</P>
<P>
   He beat Thome 3-2 in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good after batting practice, so I decided I would go
ahead and do it,'' said Griffey, who received 4,202,803 All-Star
votes. ``I don't like to get booed. I figured there were about 4
million reasons I should do it, and I'm glad I did. It was a lot of
fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was (once) the hitting coach (with the Rockies), and he
said, `Just go out there and swing the bat. Don't try to do too
much, because if you hit it, it will go out'''
</P>
<P>
   Although McGwire has said he feels like a ``caged lion'' because
of the attention his daily batting-practice sessions draw, he
actually seemed to be looking forward to Monday's contest. But he
wasn't pleased with the pitch location from the BP pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the ball middle and in, and most of the pitches he
threw me were middle and away,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   The starting pitchers usually take center stage on the day
before the All-Star Game, but David Wells and Greg Maddux took a
back seat to the homer hubbub on Monday. Both are hoping the
attention shifts from home runs to quality pitching tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the fans get to see a high-scoring game with some home
runs, but hopefully not when I'm on the mound,'' Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was an easy choice for AL manager Mike Hargrove. The
Yankees lefthander has an 11-2 record and pitched a perfect game
against Minnesota on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   His mound opponent, Maddux, is the closest thing to pitching
perfection in the modern era. Maddux, who is 12-2 with a 1.54 ERA
for the Braves, will appear in his seventh All-Star Game and make
his third start.
</P>
<P>
   ``These games are always so much fun,'' he said. ``They're great
to play in; it's almost like spring training because there's no
pressure at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maddux has not pitched well in All-Star play, posting a 4.26
ERA, and Coors Field is not exactly the place to reverse one's
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Wells has his own share of horror stories from Coors, dating to
his days with the Cincinnati Reds. When asked what it would take to
be successful tonight, Wells' answer was quick and to the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luck,'' he said. ``You have to hope for luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the best pitchers from both leagues are assembled, it
seems unlikely they will be able to work enough magic to keep the
score low. But whether it's a 1-0 game or a 10-9 game, Hargrove
believes it will be enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you bring this much talent together, it's
awe-inspiring,'' he said. ``I'm very appreciative just to be
associated with it because you never know if you'll get the chance
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most special events in baseball for
everyone involved.''

SHORTEST FOLKS CONQUER BIG ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At just over 4 feet tall, entertainer Michael
Gogin prefers not to be called a dwarf or a little person but a
short-statured person.
</P>
<P>
   An actor now on screen in ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,''
Gogin has been married for 18 years to a woman who is 5 feet 2.
</P>
<P>
   But the height difference between Gogin and his wife, Darla, was
never much of an impediment. Winning the acceptance of her mother,
Helen, was the biggest obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people realize that in a relationship, there is no
height,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1,500 people from around the world who are attending the
Little People of America's 1998 National Conference at the Warner
Center Marriott Hotel this week, issues surrounding height,
disability laws, parenting and orthopedic concerns are hot topics.
</P>
<P>
   In Gogin's case, his mother-in-law knew his history, including
his first 19 years spent in and out of hospitals because of
orthopedic problems. She didn't think he could offer her daughter a
good life, both because of his stature and because he was trying to
make a living as an actor and a musician.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just told me that she was unhappy and wished her daughter
would not be involved with me,'' said Gogin, whose trademark is a
braided ponytail falling more than halfway down his back. ``Even
after we married, she tried to split us up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very hurtful,'' Darla Gogin said. ``She was civil for
most of our relationship, though she made it clear she wanted us to
divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   She kept that attitude for almost 18 years but began to come
around as she saw how her son-in-law interacted with the three sons
born to Darla and him. The first, Matt, now 16, was born with the
same dwarfism as his father.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Gogin's mother-in-law sat him down and told him:
``You're a good father.'' And she promised to provide a new house
for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like you're apologizing to me for all the years
before,'' Gogin said he told her _ and she agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Christmas, she actually said I love you,'' Gogin recalled,
still proud he won her over.
</P>
<P>
   When she died in 1996, she left the Gogins more than enough
money for a home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gogins' story is hardly unique, according to others
attending this week's conference for people 4 feet 10 and shorter,
along with their families.
</P>
<P>
   Monique Hamilton and her fiance, Stuart Davis, also experienced
opposition to their relationship when they began dating seriously
five years ago, after they developed a cross-country friendship
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   She is 3 feet 8 inches tall, and he is 5 feet 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``His family had a very difficult time accepting me,'' said
Hamilton, 26, who uses a wheelchair or crutches because of a spinal
injury nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Active her entire life with the Little People of America, she
said animosity from the average-size person's family is common when
one marries a very short person.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' family wasn't opposed to her relationship with him solely
because she is short, she said. ``They wanted him to have a family
with kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton doesn't want children because she feels she wouldn't be
able to care for them, which would force Davis to do all the work,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Southern California native, Hamilton moved to Davis' home
state of South Carolina to live with him about four years ago. Two
years ago they moved to California and now live in Lake Elsinore.
</P>
<P>
   Her relationship with his family has gotten better, said
Hamilton. Meeting her face to face helped change their minds about
her and her stature, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they felt it wasn't such a difference after all.''

USC RECRUIT TRIES TO GET CHARGES REDUCED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The status of USC football recruit Windrell Hayes
remains in doubt, but the highly touted wide receiver is attempting
to reduce felony charges to improve his chances of being eligible
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes is facing three felony counts: suspicion of writing bad
checks for merchandise, conspiracy and burglary. He was arrested in
Northern California May 22 with two other men and has pleaded
innocent to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   There is a possibility Hayes could plead guilty to one of the
felonies and make full restitution to the victims. Then the crime
would be reduced to a misdemeanor, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   However, police investigators have determined that Hayes
personally wrote about $6,000 in bad checks. Another $10,000 in bad
checks were written. But police cannot determine who wrote those
checks, according to Lodi deputy district attorney Scott Fichtner.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office has informed Hayes that he must
make restitution for the entire $16,000 for any possibility of the
charges being reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always said what he wants is a misdemeanor,'' Fichtner
said. ``It's yet to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes chances of attending USC would be greatly enhanced if he
could get the charges reduced.
</P>
<P>
   USC football coach Paul Hackett is on vacation and could not be
reached for comment. But Hackett has said he is still waiting for
all the facts to emerge before commenting.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, 6-feet, 200 pounds, is considered one of USC's impact
recruits. He started two years at San Jose State, leading the
Spartans in receiving both seasons. In 1996, Hayes was named
All-Western Athletic Conference second team after catching 58
passes for 848 yards and four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   __ Controversial tutor off football: Janice Henry, the
controversial tutor/supervisor who was a key figure in two
investigations of academic impropriety in the past three years,
will no longer assist football players
</P>
<P>
   Henry will primarily focus on assisting basketball players next
year.

COWBOYS FANS MAKE ANNUAL TICKET TREK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Longtime Dallas Cowboys fan  &UR; Juan Marquez knew
what would happen if he didn't arrive at the Cardinals' Tempe
training facility early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The best seats for the Nov. 15 game between the Cowboys and
Cardinals at Sun Devil Stadium would be gone.
</P>
<P>
   That's always the way it is when the Cardinals put single-game
tickets on sale: Cowboys fans show up before the doors open to
stand in line for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were brisk Monday, but plenty of tickets are available for
all games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm late,'' Marquez said after buying tickets. ``I meant to
get here earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquez has been a Cowboys fan since the 1970s and lets everyone
in the Valley know it. The license plate on the back of his van
says, ``Da Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   He's glad the team fired Coach  &UR; Barry Switzer after last year's
6-10 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only positive thing that happened to them last
season,'' Marquez said. ``They had the most talent in the league
last year. They should have been in the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he also follows the Cardinals on a casual basis and is
expecting them to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've shown so many (good) signs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Cowboys fan,  &UR; Jorge Kimzin, also missed the Monday
morning crush for tickets but stood in line later.
</P>
<P>
   He said he goes to a few Cardinals games each year, almost
always seeing the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't go last year (in September) because it was too
hot,'' he said. ``There's no way I'm going to sit out there in that
heat.''
</P>
<P>
   He also is glad the Cowboys have replaced Switzer with
first-year Coach
 &UR; Chan Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took too long for them to make a change,'' he said. ``They
should have gotten rid of him a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He also doesn't expect the Cardinals to go 4-12 again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think they will be better,'' he said. ``I think
the draft picks will make a difference. The key is protecting  &UR; Jake
( &UR; Plummer, quarterback). You have to protect Jake if you want to go
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Single-game tickets also are available at ETM ticket machines at
selected Safeway stores or at www.etm.com via the Internet and by
phone at 888-386-8497. &QL;  &QL; 
In demand &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State defensive tackle  &UR; Jamal Williams, considered the
top player available in Thursday's supplemental draft, visited the
Cardinals on Monday. He also took a physical examination.
</P>
<P>
   Williams became available for the draft when academic problems
forced him to withdraw from school.
</P>
<P>
   The national scouting group listed Williams, 6 feet 2, 300
pounds, as a top-20 player in next year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams consider Williams a possible first-round pick in the
supplemental draft, but it is unlikely the Cardinals would take him
in an early round because of their strength at that position.
</P>
<P>
   They are more likely to choose Navy offensive tackle  &UR; Mike Wahle
in a later round. Wahle, 6-5, 302 pounds, visited Tempe earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Any team that picks a player in the supplemental draft will lose
its corresponding pick in the 1999 regular draft. &QL;  &QL; 
Winners &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals rookies who attended last week's NFL symposium in
Denver came away with the overall first prize.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies were graded on categories such as attentiveness,
promptness and interaction with others.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cardinals rookies were awarded gold watches for
winning, first-round draft pick  &UR; Andre Wadsworth spoke for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys better get used to this,'' Wadsworth told the rookies
on the other teams. &QL;  &QL;

ALL-STAR TASTE LEAVES LEE CRAVING MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ It wasn't quite the same as driving in the winning run
to win the Big Show, but Travis Lee will take it.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie first baseman for the Diamondbacks teamed with former
Kansas City Royals star George Brett and country singer Tim McGraw
to win the MCI All-Star Hitting Challenge on Monday as a lead-in to
tonight's 69th All-Star Game at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   The purple-jerseyed trio defeated the green-clad team of Oakland
Athletics rookie outfielder Ben Grieve, actor Kevin Costner and
former slugger Dave Kingman, 370-210.
</P>
<P>
   Players were awarded points on the basis of where they hit the
ball in various ``zones.'' Ground ball hits did not count, and the
final swing of each round was double the points.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's team and Grieve's team had the highest point totals of the
four teams in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The other teams were made up of Chicago White Sox rookie Magglio
Ordonez, actor Jonathan Silverman and former star outfielder Andre
Dawson; and Colorado Rockies rookie first baseman Todd Helton,
Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway and former Milwaukee Brewers
star and Paradise Valley resident Robin Yount.
</P>
<P>
   Lee hit only one home run in the first round, scoring 230 points
on eight swings, but came back in the second round to hit three,
good for 180 points on five swings. He took home a small glass
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few of the pitches were a little low, and in a normal
situation during a game, I probably would have gone the opposite
way,'' the left-handed-hitting Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The experience was enjoyable for Lee, ``because I got to hit
with George and meet Tim and Kevin Costner. They seem like
down-to-earth, everyday guys. George is kind of funny. He still has
that competitive spirit and was getting us pumped up for the second
round.''
</P>
<P>
   How could it have been more enjoyable?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was out there (with the National League All-Stars)
taking batting practice for real. I'm just a fan right now,'' said
Lee, who flew back to Phoenix on Monday night for a little rest
before the season resumes Friday against Cincinnati at Bank One
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Lee had a solid first half for the Diamondbacks, hitting .284
with 47 RBIs and a team-leading 17 home runs. It shouldn't be long
before he is an All-Star for real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him play twice this summer,'' said Brett, who with
brother Bobby owns the Diamondbacks' High Desert affiliate of the
Class A California League.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good hitter,'' Brett said. ``He's going to be one of
those hitters who can hit over .300 consistently in the major
leagues _ hit 15, 20, 25 home runs, driving in 100 runs. There's no
doubt in my mind that he has that capability.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: AFTER THE BOOS, GRIFFEY HOMERS FOR THE FANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The idea that fans would boo Junior would have been
unthinkable before Monday. He was everybody's darling, this
happy-go-lucky kid who always wore a smile, enjoyed himself daily,
joked with people and appeared unflappable.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday the Coors Field fans booed Ken Griffey Jr. They
followed immediately by lustily cheering Mark McGwire. The two
All-Stars were on the field receiving awards as the top
vote-getters in their respective leagues, but the fans' starkly
contrasting receptions for them had to do with the home run contest
that would follow an hour or so later.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was enthusiastically participating in the contest that
has become, in some ways, more popular than the game itself.
Griffey had declined to participate. Politely, but he had declined.
</P>
<P>
   So had some of the other top home run hitters of the home
run-dominated 1998 season. Sammy Sosa had excused himself because
of soreness behind his left shoulder _ he missed the Chicago Cubs'
game on Sunday because of it _ but others, such as Juan Gonzalez
and Greg Vaughn, like Griffey, had said no. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This one said he was always sore after the contest and needed a
few days to recover. That one said the contest would mess up his
swing because he wasn't a home run hitter. The focus, though, was
on Griffey, whose 35 home runs are second to McGwire's 37 in the
pursuit of Roger Maris' home run record.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure was on Griffey, too, in the form of the boos that
cascaded into his psyche. At the last minute he changed his mind,
competed in the contest and won it. ``I usually get booed on the
road,'' he said after the contest, ``but in this situation, an
All-Star game, I really didn't like it. They felt they wanted me in
the home run competition so I did it. This is not a time to get
booed, at an All-Star game.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who has been generally viewed as baseball's most
popular player, had talked throughout the day as if he planned to
skip the contest. And he meant it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I flew seven hours to get to a press conference at 9
o'clock,'' he said at a news conference before batting practice,
explaining his decision. ``The home run contest didn't start until
4 o'clock. By 4 o'clock I was worn out. So I said this year I just
can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   At yet an earlier news conference, Griffey was asked whether he
preferred playing center field, his position, or left in Tuesday
night's game. ``It doesn't matter where I play,'' he said. ``It's
for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, he was asked later as he sat at his locker, don't you
think the fans want to see you compete with McGwire and the others
in the home run contest? ``That's a little different,'' he said.
``They voted for me to play the game. They didn't ask me to do the
home run competition.''
</P>
<P>
   If fans voted for players to compete in the home run contest, of
course, Griffey would be a big winner there, too. He acknowledged
as much after the contest. ``If they want to see me in the home run
competition,'' he said, ``that's four million reasons why I did it.
For them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the boos, he said, that changed his stance. The record
Coors Field crowd of 51,231 made a difference. So did Frank
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   On the scene as a representative of the commissioner's office,
the Hall of Famer spoke with Griffey half an hour after batting
practice. Robinson told Junior that if he wanted to stick to his
decision not to compete, that was all right, but. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``You listen to guys with those type of numbers, those
credentials,'' Griffey said. ``You don't know everything. This is
my 10th year in the big leagues and I'm still learning. If a guy
with those type of numbers relates something to me that's positive,
I've got to listen to him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Griffey had said that he didn't think it was fair of fans or
anyone else to criticize him for his position, but, fair or not,
the Coors Field fans didn't stop with their initial boos. Every
time Griffey stepped into the cage during batting practice, they
booed him. They had cheered McGwire every time he batted and
cheered again when he hit a batting practice pitch into the seats
or to some other distant part of the park.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was asked to explain his outlook on the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it started in '92 when I accepted that I was a home
run hitter in the game,'' he said. ``It was the first year that I
really enjoyed hitting in a home run contest. It turns out it's
probably the most fun thing to do in the All-Star Game. I enjoy it.
Why guys are backing out, I'm sure they all have their own reasons,
but I enjoy it. It's something I do. It's something I've accepted
that I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, a players association official said three weeks ago
that Griffey said he would compete even as he was continuing to say
publicly that he would not. But it took the fans' reaction to
induce the public Griffey to keep the private Griffey's word.

RACIAL PROFILING PROTESTED IN CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRUMBULL, Conn. _ Saying the police have often stopped motorists
based on their race, the president of the state chapter of the
NAACP led a ``freedom drive'' protest from Bridgeport to
neighboring Trumbull on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The practice, known as racial profiling, recently gained
attention in Trumbull after officers said a 1993 memo by Police
Chief Theodore Ambrosini included coded references to racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrosini has denied that his department practices racial
profiling, but he has also said he sees nothing wrong with being
aware of ``strangers'' who drive through Trumbull, where blacks
make up about 2 percent of the 32,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The memo said, ``Not only is it our obligation to enforce the
motor vehicle laws, but in doing so, we are provided with a profile
of our community and those who travel within its boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Vann, president of the state and greater New Haven
chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, criticized the 68-member, all-white Trumbull Police
Department at a forum on Monday at Messiah Baptist Church in
Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're calling us liars when they deny that profiling exists,
and we won't tolerate it any longer,'' Vann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who is black and has driven a car knows all too well
that this is something that continues to happen all across this
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Alvin Penn, a Bridgeport Democrat, told those
gathered at the rally that the Trumbull police stopped him in 1996
and asked him if he knew which town he was in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a humiliating and debilitating experience,'' Penn said,
``and we must put an end to allowing people with authority and a
badge being able to stop you, detain you and pull you from your car
under the guise of making a traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a paramount issue that is gaining attention on a state
and national level. But I'm angry, very angry, that this is still
permitted to take place in America in 1998.''

ANGELS TOOK DETOUR TO TOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels had high hopes to start the
season.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they had re-signed Ken Hill and acquired free-agent
Jack McDowell for the starting rotation; had catcher Todd Greene
and second baseman Randy Velarde coming back from injuries, and had
the best young outfield in baseball in Garret Anderson, Jim Edmonds
and Tim Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Well, things didn't go the way they were planned.
</P>
<P>
   Hill and McDowell are on the disabled list, as well as another
starter, Allen Watson. Greene never made it back from the DL and
Velarde has played in two games, with no return in sight. Also, the
outfield hasn't had Salmon since April 22, when he suffered a
partial tear of a ligament in his left foot. He's been limited to
serving as the designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   When May ended, the Angels were 27-26 and 5{ games behind Texas
in the American League West and in desperate need of some frontline
pitching to just stay in the AL West race. And they got it, just
not from where they expected it.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Jarrod Washburn was brought up from Triple-A
Vancouver, Omar Olivares was moved into the starting rotation and
Steve Sparks came off the scrap heap to provide the needed shot in
the arm. Washburn, a 23-year-old rookie; Sparks, a 32-year-old
knuckleballer; and Olivares, who turned 31 Monday, have combined
for a 12-5 record and a 3.61 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would have told me in May we'd be in first place at the
All-Star break,'' Collins said, ``I would have laughed at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins might be not be laughing, but he can certainly afford a
smile. The Angels went 22-6 in June, winning more games in any
month in the club's history. At the All-Star break, the team is in
first place with a 49-37 record, 1{ games ahead of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround came suddenly. The Angels had gone 12-15 in May
and seemed to be struggling to keep their heads above water. The
Angels point to a couple games that sparked their resurgence:
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; May 31 at Minnesota. The Angels trailed 5-0 after
four innings but came back to win 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; June 2 at Kansas City. The Angels and Royals
fought several times during a 7-5 Angels win. The fights resulted
in the suspension of manager Terry Collins for eight games during a
crucial part of the schedule. Five players were also suspended.
</P>
<P>
   While the pitching of Washburn, Sparks and Olivares has been
crucial, so too has the steadiness of other players.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also have gotten a typical Chuck Finley (8-4, 3.16
ERA), and enough offense to make any game interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad plays in today's All-Star Game and has been the
Angels' best hitter (.313, 18 homers, 59 RBI). Anderson has gotten
hot after a slow start to post good numbers (.302, 10 homers, 40
RBI).
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds continues to play Gold Glove-caliber center field and is
hitting well (.304, 15 homers, 50 RBI). Despite his injury, Salmon
is a threat at the plate (.265, 15 homers, 43 RBI). Cecil Fielder,
signed to be the DH, has instead filled in at first base and played
well. He's also second on the team with 58 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Gary DiSarcina's biggest asset to the team is his
defense, and his .313 average is a bonus. Rookie Justin Baughman
has become the club's second baseman and is the team's fastest
player.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have gotten solid work out of the bullpen, none more
so than Troy Percival, who joins Erstad at the All-Star game with a
major-league-leading 25 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things went wrong in the first half,'' general manager
Bill Bavasi said, referring to the injuries. ``But some guys played
pretty well, too. Whether it's injuries or performance, there's a
ledger. It goes well or it doesn't. There are going to be injuries
and guys that don't play well. You've got to hope the other guys
pick them up.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Angels overcame their first-half problems, they say
they'll need better luck and the same type of performance in the
second half to reach the playoffs for the first time in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't lose any more pitchers,'' Collins said. ``And we need
guys to do what we expect them to do. This game in the second half
is won by the big guys. And we have some good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Angels went into the break with a season-worst
five-game losing streak, they feel good about their chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at the big picture,'' DiSarcina said. ``We've
played above everybody's expectations despite all the injuries. If
you sit back and look at the big picture, you have to be proud of
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have been in this position before, as recently as
1995, before failing late in the season. But the players who were
there in '95 say they learned from their failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys have got to stay mentally strong,'' Percival said.
``We're not the most talented team in baseball, we're not even the
most talented team in the AL West. But we're definitely the
toughest and most resilient.''

WHITE ABALONE POISED ON BRINK OF EXTINCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By GLEN MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A once-abundant California mollusk appears
headed the way of the dinosaur, earning the unenviable distinction
of being the only marine invertebrate to face extinction through
human activity.
</P>
<P>
   A planned effort by marine scientists to take white abalone and
induce them to spawn in captivity may be the last chance to save
the species.
</P>
<P>
   White abalone were once plentiful off the coast of Southern
California. Of the eight species of California abalone, the white
abalone lived at the greatest depths _ between 80 and 300 feet.
They were so deep, in fact, that they weren't discovered until
1940. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the inhospitableness of their
preferred habitat prevented divers from harvesting them.
</P>
<P>
   But both diving equipment and skills progressed significantly by
the 1970s, allowing commercial divers to exploit white abalone
beds.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a ready market for the tasty marine snails. At
eight inches long, they are somewhat smaller than red abalone, the
most commonly consumed abalone species. But whites are particularly
succulent and are far more tender than reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need to be pounded like reds before they're
cooked,'' said Konstantin Karpov, a senior biologist with the
California Department of Fish and Game's Noyo Marine Laboratory in
Fort Bragg. ``They were considered a truly gourmet species, and
they brought top dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, it seemed that white abalone were as limitless as
buffalo were during the early 19th century. In many areas, the
plump gastropods exceeded densities of one per square yard.
</P>
<P>
   But white abalone resembled the buffalo in more than numbers.
They also shared a similar fate. Like the buffalo, the abalone were
relentlessly hunted until their populations plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers tell it all. The annual white abalone catch peaked
in 1972 at 65 metric tons. It then fell to less than one metric ton
in 1979. The catch stayed flat until 1995, when the California
Department of Fish and Game banned the harvest of white abalone
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely that white abalone will soon be listed as an
endangered species, but that's probably too little, too late,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, we began conducting surveys to determine the state of
the (white abalone) resource,'' said Fish and Game biologist Pete
Haaker, the state's lead scientist on the white abalone problem.
``It was very discouraging. We surveyed 3.06 hectares (about 6.5
acres) of prime white abalone habitat and found only three live
abalone and 119 empty shells. Before that area was exploited, we
would have found about 12,000 abalone.''
</P>
<P>
   While those findings indicate that white abalone are not yet
extinct, the end could come fairly soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There simply isn't enough density to allow the animals to
successfully reproduce,'' said Haaker, explaining that abalone and
other mollusks propagate by releasing sperm and ova into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, biologists thought that white abalone
would endure because their harvest was subjected to size
restrictions _ divers legally could take only large specimens.
</P>
<P>
   But because white abalone had never been exploited before the
1970s, most were mature, and hence of legal size, when commercial
diving got under way. Vast beds were wiped out before scientists
realized what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, the concept of extinction (through overharvesting)
was foreign to marine fisheries managers,'' said Karpov. ``We used
to think in terms of a surplus population that could be safely
removed, because it would be replaced through the reproduction of
the remaining animals. What we didn't know is that there is a
critical density of animals that you can't fall below, or the
entire population collapses.''
</P>
<P>
   Haaker said that abalone reproduction is a tricky affair in the
best of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a matter of successful spawning,'' he said.
``Abalone are free-swimming when young, and they later settle out
(on rocks). If water conditions aren't optimum, they don't settle
successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many years when water temperatures and currents aren't
ideal, said Haaker, and thus few young abalone are produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the big flaws in earlier abalone management
policies,'' Haaker said. ``It was assumed they reproduced
successfully every year. Now we know they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   A pending diving project may be the white abalone's last hope,
Haaker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go down in submersibles (small submarines), mark any
abalone we can find with buoys, then send divers down to recover
them,'' Haaker said. ``We'll probably use special chemicals to
anesthetize and relax the animals so they won't be injured when we
take them off the rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   These last surviving specimens will be taken to a laboratory,
where biologists hope they can be induced to spawn, although white
abalone have not been propagated under artificial conditions, as
red abalone have.
</P>
<P>
   If young abalone are eventually obtained, they can be used to
reseed depopulated habitat, Haaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Haaker said there could be remnant colonies of white abalone in
the ocean off Mexico, but American biologists haven't been able to
secure approval from the Mexican government to conduct a search.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican authorities have made it clear they aren't
interested,'' he said. ``They're still looking at white abalone as
a resource to be exploited, while we're looking at them as an
endangered species to be preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the white abalone's fate has not been lost
on biologists, said Karpov.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be too late for the whites, but we're applying what
we've learned to the management of other (abalone) species,'' he
said. ``One important lesson is that abalone stocks are extremely
vulnerable to cumulative impacts _ excessive harvesting combined
with disease and sea otter depredation, for example. Suddenly you
find that the populations have dropped below the point where they
can sustain themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Biologists will need all their acumen, and some luck, to make
sure other abalone species don't follow whites into oblivion.
Black, pink and green abalone also have experienced catastrophic
declines in recent years, and extinction is a definite possibility
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been hit by withering disease, which is caused by a
microorganism that thrives during warm water conditions like El
Nino,'' said Karpov. ``The blacks and greens are particularly
vulnerable. We're very concerned about them.'' &QL;

PRIME TIME TO CONVERT TO A ROTH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 47 and have just changed careers and will be in school
until late 1999. I will be working part time _ and maybe less.
Would this be a good time to convert my $50,000 IRA to a Roth? It
consists of $2,000 in Vanguard Specialized Health Care fund and the
rest in Vanguard Wellington. I expect my annual income will be less
than $20,000 a year until I graduate. Upon eventually retiring, I
doubt that my income will be enormous, since my career change is
into the nursing field.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you're in a low tax bracket now and will be in a low tax
bracket when you retire, it will make no difference whether you
convert.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I like the idea for several reasons. One is that things
may work out better than you think in retirement. Another is that a
Roth IRA is a lot more flexible than a traditional one, most
notably because owners face no mandatory withdrawal schedules. And
finally, there's the big wild card, which is the question of
whether tax rates in 18 years or so will be similar to today's
rates; if it turns out that they are higher, the conversion will,
in retrospect, seem a very wise move.
</P>
<P>
   But you cannot withdraw the money from the IRAs to pay the taxes
without facing penalties, so you will have to come up with the
money to pay the taxes on the conversion.
</P>
<P>
   If it were stretched out over four years, this could amount to
as little as about $1,800 a year (I'm making some guesses about
your earnings and tax situation here), and that figure is getting
close to 10 percent of your expected total income.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My fiancee and I are planning to buy a house and start a
small family. We have about $80,000 in various growth mutual fund
accounts intended for a down payment. She claims a single-family
house has better resale value than a condo. Is that true? We've
looked at a property listed at $150,000. Our combined income is
$50,000. Is it wise to put the entire $80,000 down? We don't have
any debts and have about $5,000 in checking and savings accounts.
Should we go with a fixed-rate or an adjustable-rate mortgage?
</P>
<P>
   D.C., Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not an expert on real estate, but it seems the general
consensus is that the market for single-family homes is far
stronger than for condos. Further, as the market gets weaker, the
variance in strength between the two tends to become broader. So
all things being equal, I would favor your fiancee's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of making a large down payment are twofold: One,
of course, is the larger the down payment, the smaller the monthly
payments. The other is that you can usually get a better mortgage
rate with a large down payment.
</P>
<P>
   However small, a mortgage will cut into your income stream at
least for a few years, and will increase your expenses for many,
many years. So your current emergency savings, representing 10
percent of your annual income, should be boosted _ at least doubled
and better quadrupled. This would leave you with $65,000 for a down
payment, enough to command a favorable rate.
</P>
<P>
   I favor fixed-rate mortgages, because you can do your financial
planning without worrying that higher rates might increase your
biggest single expense. With the pressures of starting a family,
operating (at least for a time) with a reduced income stream, and
facing the expenses of children, this is not something you want to
worry about.
</P>
<P>
   One final thing, since it seems you are thinking of making your
purchase fairly quickly: Immediately move that $80,000 into money
market funds. Now that you've made your plans, this has become
short-term money, and it should be invested conservatively.

 &HT;    Unloved, unhealthy child adopted into the hearts of new parents
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The drive from the orphanage was long
and quiet. She looked out the window. He prayed. Or maybe it was
the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, just to keep their wandering imaginations
in check, they would ask a question of Galina, their translator,
and she would answer, her words and expressions soft and melodious.
And it seemed to new parents Jim and Connie Brown that their whole
world might very well be spinning in a very disorienting slow
motion.
</P>
<P>
   They drove through the country, two-lane roads in the northwest
part of Siberia, away from the old wooden cottages where
who-knows-what had occurred. Away, away, away, as the child in
their arms, the stinking child with the deformed face, screamed and
cried and squirmed.
</P>
<P>
   And while this was the day they'd been wanting, indeed, waiting
for, the one thing they could not do was bring themselves to look
too long at the boy who was now their son.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brown hadn't quite known what to expect when they'd agreed
to adopt this unloved child from an orphanage on the northern
fringe of Siberia. At first he was horrified at the idea.
</P>
<P>
   For heaven's sake, they were first-time parents. They wanted a
pink newborn who smelled of baby powder. They wanted someone
healthy, someone who might grow up to look just like one of them!
And now, here they were, a world away from home, driving through
forest after forest of tall trees, thinking about the truth that
faced them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that they told us could be wrong was,'' Jim Brown
says now.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, for it was a five-hour drive back to the
town of Tyumen, Connie Brown would force herself to look at the
little boy born to an unmarried Russian woman. And she supposed he
was beautiful if you could work your eyes past the dirty, gray cast
on his leg and the lone decaying brown tooth and the gnarled
opening, a hole, really, where his upper lip should have been. But
that was part of the reason the Browns has agreed to take in this
child. He had been born with a cleft palate.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Connie had been.
</P>
<P>
   And, so, there were brief moments when Connie was able to
convince herself that maybe this wasn't going to be so bad. Maybe
this was going to be OK, maybe this child was just unloved, not
profoundly mentally retarded. The dear little thing would open his
mouth and out would come the only sound this boy had ever made:
</P>
<P>
   A long, throaty, guttural moan that sounded more animal than
human.
</P>
<P>
   And Connie Brown would turn toward the window so she could watch
the clouds whir by.
</P>
<P>
   After they married in 1984, they half-heartedly tried to start a
family, with no success. Then in 1991 _ after several miscarriages
and several failed trips to the fertility specialist _ they
realized it would probably have to be adoption.
</P>
<P>
   So they contacted an agency, scraped together the money and
filled out their application. She quit her job (long story, but it
was taking her away from the adoption paperwork) and they began The
Long Wait.
</P>
<P>
   All along, the Browns, who met in 1983, figured they'd get a
newborn baby. But on a weekday morning in September 1994, the woman
from the adoption agency called.
</P>
<P>
   We have a child, she said. Connie Brown listened with just a
hint of hope.
</P>
<P>
   He's about 2 years old. So much for cute newborn clothes from
the Gap, thought Connie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   He has a cleft palate. Now that's weird, thought Brown, who
herself was born with a bilateral cleft palate and had gone through
dozens of facial surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   He's in Russia, the adoption worker said.
</P>
<P>
   And it was then that Connie Brown called her husband, who of
course had the presence of mind _ or was it just plain old common
sense? _ to say what his wife should have said all along.
</P>
<P>
   Are you nuts?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, they were.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months and about $30,000 later, Connie and Jim Brown were
leaving the village of Tobol'sk with a boy they named Judah
wriggling in Jim Brown's arms.
</P>
<P>
   When the new family got back to the room they were using in
Tyumen, Connie and Jim Brown had their first good look at their
son.
</P>
<P>
   His head was scabbed with sores that wept down both sides of his
face, from scurvy, they believed, and one of his eyes had gone
crossed from lack of visual stimulation. Even though he was nearly
4 years old, he wore 0-6-month-size shoes and was the size of an
11-month-old baby. The entire right bottom half of his body was
encased in a plaster cast. Judah had broken his right leg about a
month or so before the Browns came to get him.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Connie did when they got back to the room was
fetch her manicure scissors and start cutting. Jim held the child;
she snipped. She snipped and snipped and snipped that hard, dirty,
smelly plaster away until her fingers bled. But, finally, the cast
fell away. And what they saw turned their stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   The plaster had been wrapped around Judah's skin so tightly, it
had cut off circulation to his lower body. His genitals were
swollen and blue. His skin was gray, his joints swollen from
rickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first time I really looked at him, Judah was
laying in Jim's arms on the bed. And he was doing this orphan
thing, rocking back and forth, which is not to be described,''
Connie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I just stood there, in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns had been told that Judah, born Anatoli Zhigalov, was
probably about 2 years old; it turned out he was 3 years, 7 months
old when they picked him up May 13, 1995. But he weighed little
more than 22 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Judah could not walk and he could not crawl. But he could sit
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all he ever did, was sit up in his crib,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns believed at first that their son was profoundly
retarded. But slowly _ slowly _ a healthy mind began to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   It was, says Connie Brown, ``the journey of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the things the Browns will never, ever forget about
those early days. They were living in Miami then, but they now live
in West Palm Beach where Jim, 34, works for Wackenhut security.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, even the open outdoors was strange and baffling.
Judah would try to wipe the wind from his cheeks. ``Imagine,'' says
Connie Brown now.
</P>
<P>
   The steady hum of the refrigerator freaked him out. So did the
ring of the telephone and the voices coming from the television.
Judah had been born into an impoverished life, yes. And because of
his facial deformities, he had been deprived of what little love,
food and comfort were available in the Siberian orphanage. But it
was the only home he'd ever known.
</P>
<P>
   He had never seen himself in the mirror, never seen his gnarled
mouth. And when Connie showed him, he looked at his face, then he
looked away. Then he looked at his face, then he looked away.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Connie showed the little boy the inside of the roof of
her mouth, which is still deformed like his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahhhh,'' he shrieked, the light bulb going off in his head.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all this, Jim and Connie Brown, deeply devoted
people who believe they were led to Judah by God, also saw in Judah
the very thing the adoption service had told them about.
</P>
<P>
   The magic of his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something inside his eyes that told us there was
somebody in there,'' Connie says.
</P>
<P>
   They just had to find him.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Judah.
</P>
<P>
   He is 6 years old and weighs 46 pounds. He loves to swim, ride a
bike and play with Chopper Dave, the little Army man who's about
the size of a giant bottle of Tylenol and keeps getting lost, then
getting found, then getting lost. Well, you've got the picture.
</P>
<P>
   This was not an easy journey. In those early days, Connie's arms
ached from holding Judah tight as he fought off the comfort of her
love. He did not call her Mother for a year and a half. He's had
three surgeries, all by the same surgeon in Miami who did Connie's
facial surgeries all those years ago. And what a job on Judah.
There's barely a seam.
</P>
<P>
   So proud is Connie Brown about her son that she'll readily tell
you how smart he is: He can read, write, add, subtract, color,
paint, draw, tie his shoes, tell time, fold his clothes, clean his
room _ and sing like an angel.
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. The happy ending. The happy boy with the
happy parents. They laugh and sing and pray and pass the time of
day like the most blissful of families.
</P>
<P>
   Except, not too long ago, Connie, 45, made a phone call to the
adoption agency. ``I have always thought that Judah should have
siblings,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, the agency has two children.
</P>
<P>
   Each has a cleft palate. Each is dirty and sick and smelly. Each
is near death at an orphanage in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   But the Browns are undaunted by these truths.
</P>
<P>
   They want to bring these children home. They want to teach them
how to love and laugh. They want to teach them about the wind.

 &HT;    Recording CDs adds twist with audio option
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philips suggests that you dig out those old records, pile up
your compact discs and make yourself the customized sets of music
that you've always wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Philips also suggests that a good way to do this is by
purchasing the company's CDR870, the second in the company's line
of CD recorders, which lets consumers make digital recordings from
CDs, vinyl long-playing records and even live music.
</P>
<P>
   The recording of CDs got its start, of course, as a way to
compile huge piles of data that you either couldn't store in your
computer, needed to transfer to another computer or just plumb
wanted to protect from a computer crash. With the Philips machine
and others like it, the whole notion of recording your own CDs
seems to be making a leap into the world of consumer audio.
</P>
<P>
   The recording of straight data continues, but the software has
improved dramatically, making it much easier to record music _ from
digital or analog LPs. In fact, CD recorder drives will probably
soon be built-in features for personal computers. The external
drives are now selling for as little as $300.
</P>
<P>
   The technology now permits, not just customized copying, but the
ability to cut unwanted noise on the original. The Philips machine,
while twice as expensive as the external drive, is built for use as
a music recorder that will be part of the user's stereo system. The
suggested retail price for CDR870 is $649, but an alert observer of
national mail-order houses might find it listed for under $600.
</P>
<P>
   The Philips works with either the CD-R discs that can only be
recorded once or the much more expensive CD-RW format, the
rewriteable discs that can be re-recorded more than 1,000 times.
</P>
<P>
   Recording industry executives snarl if you mention the idea of
passing along the copies at a profit. However, they sigh and
acknowledge that they will accept consumer use of copying
techniques for personal use. But how much work do you want to do to
make a copy? The devices and software are still ``as much labor as
love,'' according to The New York Times. ``The user may need to
spend three or four times as much time as the length of the music
being recorded to make a successful CD. And that does not take into
account planning and learning time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can let someone else make the darned CD. There
are services like Custom Revolutions (http://www.customdisc.com)
that will make a CD for you from their own catalog. The drawback to
that is that their catalog may not match your tastes quite as much
as those hundreds of old records gathering dust in your basement.
</P>
<P>
   Truth and drudgery
</P>
<P>
   It's been a bad time for print.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, print journalists might have self-righteously
turned up their noses at the likes of Matt Drudge, author of the
Drudge Report, which has become one of the Internet's hottest
sites. After Drudge ran several problematic stories about the
Clinton White House, the cheerleaders of print might have sniffed
that rumor-mongering was a poor substitute for real journalism.
</P>
<P>
   But then came June and July. The New Republic admitted that a
writer made up scads of things, including companies he was writing
about. The Boston Globe fired an acclaimed columnist for making up
quotes and the people who supposedly said them. Then last week, The
Cincinnati Enquirer canned a reporter after announcing that he had
stolen voice mail messages that were used in an investigative
series on Chiquita.
</P>
<P>
   We seem to have proven that print is fallible. What about the
Net?
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the big picture, the first issue of Brill's Content
has a voluminous story about press coverage of the Monica Lewinsky
matter. That piece, written by Stephen Brill, is bitterly critical
of print, Net and broadcast, slamming everyone from Drudge to Sam
Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   But tucked away in that same issue of Brill's Content is author
and near-ubiquitous Net guru Esther Dyson. She says the Net is all
about the end of ``the official story,'' the take on events that
was once controlled by authorities in Warsaw, Wall Street and
Washington. ``The guys who talk back to the advertisements, the
dissidents, the disgruntled employees and whistle-blowers, the
cranks and the truth-tellers _ all have found their medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson suggests neither glorification nor vilification of the
Net. Instead, she says that people should exercise their own
quality control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as consumers now expect labels and other information on
the goods they buy, they need to start looking for the same kind of
disclosure on their information,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   No, she doesn't want an official government certification, a
stamp on information. The responsibility lies elsewhere, she says.
``Yes, there is an information market for the truth. But it will
work only if we have educated citizens, demanding disclosure and
able to judge for themselves what is true.''

 &HT;    Tech Tools: Compressed archive files need a ZIP to get going
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Every so often someone asks me what to do with a ZIP
file, that is, a file with a .ZIP extension.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sure sign that people are still buying their first
computers without any prior experience, because ZIP files have been
with us about as long as modems, and the current popularity of the
Internet has made them even more prominent.
</P>
<P>
   A ZIP file is an archive file, often consisting of several
different files that have been compressed and packed into a single
file with the .ZIP extension.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of archiving is to make large files into smaller
ones. This can be done for storage purposes, but it is most
commonly done for transmission of binary files over telephone
lines. The amount of space saved depends on the type of files. Text
files are rarely zipped. Graphic files such as .JPG, .GIF, .EPS,
and so forth, are already compressed and little if anything is
gained by zipping them.
</P>
<P>
   There are an amazing number of ZIP programs commercially
available now; ZipMagic from Mijenix is a good one. WinZip is a
common shareware program.
</P>
<P>
   The original programs, and the programs whose code is included
in all these latter-day commercial programs, are PKZIP.EXE and its
counterpart, PKUNZIP.EXE. They were marketed as shareware by PKWARE
Inc. in 1989. Nowadays, as far as I can tell, it's considered
freeware unless you plan to use it commercially. PKZIP, which makes
the ZIP file, and PKUNZIP, which extracts the original files from
it, can be found just about anywhere on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, relatively primitive programs, still stuck in
DOS command line mode, and they take more effort to use than most
folks are willing to put forth. If you have downloaded a .ZIP file,
for instance, and along with it procured PKUNZIP.EXE, you want to
put them both in the same directory to avoid a real hassle. If all
you wish to do is extract the binary files from the archive, you
open a DOS window, go to the proper directory and first type the
name of the program, i.e., PKUNZIP. Then type a space and the name
of the archive file, which might be, for instance, ARCHIV.ZIP.
</P>
<P>
   The program will then pull out all the compacted files into the
same directory. It will do a lot more things, and to find out about
them, you simply type the name of the program without giving it a
file to take apart. It will show a fairly comprehensive list of
switches and commands.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you're going to do a lot of this and you aren't
comfortable typing commands in a DOS window, you might as well get
one of the commercial archiving programs. They all use PKWARE's
basic programs _ WINZIP even requires that PKUNZIP.EXE be available
for some operations _ but they make it easy and intuitive to use
the fancy stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers, i.e., those who have been messing with computers for
more than 10 years, will recall that PKWARE once had competition.
Its main adversary was LHARC, made by Haruyasu Yoshizaki and first
distributed in 1988. Its files had the extension .LHZ or LHC.
</P>
<P>
   It had the original advantage of being able to make a
self-extracting file, in other words, an archive file with an .EXE
extension that could be unarchived simply by executing it. That's
now possible with the other programs that unzip files. You still
see LHARC used on program distribution disks occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is more than almost anyone would want to know
about ZIP files and archivers in general, but if I don't explain
things in some detail, I run almost no chance of making a mistake,
thus disappointing many readers.

 &HT;    Hungry grasshoppers chew up Central Texas
 &HT;    By Jodi Wetuski
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Backyard gardens and farmers' fields all over
Central Texas are falling victim to a bumper crop of grasshoppers,
whose tiny jaws are chewing through plants, grasses and even tough
tree bark at a hungry pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``In isolated areas in the county, it's a severe situation,''
said Doug Andrews, McLennan County, Texas extension agent. ``I've
gotten many, many calls about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In normal years, a certain type of fungus limits the grasshopper
population by killing a good portion of the eggs, Andrews said. But
this year's dry weather kept that fungus from growing, allowing the
eggs to hatch unchecked, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a swarm of bugs who are not too picky about what
they eat, devouring everything from front-yard flowers to cotton to
peaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll eat grasses, shrubs, leaves,'' Andrews said. ``In some
cases they're even eating the bark off trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hansen, a farmer who lives halfway between Lorena and
Chilton, said he's got a few grasshoppers in his soybeans, but the
drought killed off much of that crop anyway, so he doesn't
anticipate many bug-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said the farmers who have the most difficulties with
grasshoppers are those who have pasture land near their crops. The
insects will come out of the dry grass looking for something to
eat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said he's heard stories from other farmers about
grasshoppers eating the bit of green plant that connects ears of
corn to the stalk, causing the corn to fall to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like anything that's green,'' he said. ``If it's green
they eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials fear the worst is yet to come _ for this season
and for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   John Cooper, a Denton County extension agent, said grasshopper
season won't peak this year for another two weeks. That's when each
square yard of land is expected to be host to about 80 of the
insects, far more than in an average year.
</P>
<P>
   And Kerry Bryan, a plant health director for the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, said more adults hopping around now means more eggs
later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Each adult female can lay anywhere from 200 to 400 eggs from now
until early fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said the grasshopper explosion has been on a roll for
about three years _ with each year getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's building up to what we had in 1984 _ when we had
thousands and thousands of acres of range land that was being
attacked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During that year, Congress appropriated money for one of the
biggest spray campaigns in grasshopper history.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Bryan said, grasshopper outbreaks have not been as
damaging so lawmakers have stopped funding such domestic
agriculture programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any big outbreaks after '84, '85, '86,'' Bryan
said. ``They thought we weren't using the money.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's time again to deal with the droves of gnawing pests,
Bryan said, before they become an economic danger.
</P>
<P>
   County extension agents said it will be difficult to gauge how
much damage grasshoppers have done on crops because drought losses
have been so severe _ in the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   As for what can be done about grasshopper infestations, the
answer is, simply, not much. There are several chemical
insecticides approved for homes and gardens. Or people can simply
wait the insects out.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said grasshopper invasions of this magnitude usually
happen every 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cycle,'' he said. ``I don't think it's related to El
Nino or anything like that.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: As mom scales new heights, son worries
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON A MOUNTAINTOP SIX MILES FROM A PAVED ROAD, N.C. _ ``From the
front porch there'll be a 140-degree view of at least five mountain
ranges and that's with clouds,'' I babble into the cell phone.
``I'm six miles up a gravel road from the nearest pavement, and
there are bears. Isn't that great?''
</P>
<P>
   My son, back in the flatlands of Columbus, Ohio, is not
committing himself to an answer. His silence is ominous, but I'm
too excited to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Living in a mountain cabin with a screened porch on the front
and some bears out back has been my dream for longer than I can
remember. The other is losing weight while gorging on disgusting
quantities of Breyer's butter pecan.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he speaks. ``When I talked with you
</P>
<P>
   day-before-yesterday, you were at home, which, if I may remind
you, is 90 miles north of me, and you had no plans. Now you're
calling from the top of some mountain?'' He sounds a little distant
and a whole lot confused. ``Mom,'' he says rather sternly reminding
me of the way I must have sounded to him when he was small, ``where
are you? Exactly?'' I consult the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``In North Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother!'' He's getting serious. It's time to shape up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of in the northwest corner,'' I tell him, then, ``gotta
go
</P>
<P>
   now because the man who owns the top of the mountain wants to
show us a stream out back. I'll call you later.'' I push the cell
phone's ``End'' button and shove it into my back pocket, declaring
myself ready for the trek.
</P>
<P>
   A cool drizzle has drifted onto the mountainside. I turn up my
</P>
<P>
   shirt collar to divert the rain that's trickling down my neck.
Then I
</P>
<P>
   look around. Over there, I'm thinking, that's where the
fireplace will be and all around it will be glass. I picture myself
in front of a
</P>
<P>
   warming fire, all scrunched down in a big chair, watching the
mist slide over the mountains. There'll be coffee on the stove,
cats on the hearth, and peace in my world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch your step here, it's getting a little slick.'' The
warning
</P>
<P>
   brings me back to reality. I should have worn boots. I should
have worn a poncho. Heck, I don't even own a poncho. What do I know
about mountain living?
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, here I am, 3,000 feet up the side of a mountain,
</P>
<P>
   slogging through the woods with my Lake Erie-level lungs
protesting the whole way ... and I'm all wet. I hear my friend ask
about wells and septic systems. The answer doesn't interest me. I'm
busy locating things.
</P>
<P>
   The sleeping loft will be up there, I'm thinking as I gaze into
</P>
<P>
   the tops of some lanky pines. Just above the kitchen, facing the
</P>
<P>
   fireplace. I picture myself lying in bed, watching the fire burn
itself
</P>
<P>
   out for the night and then, in the early morning's grayness,
</P>
<P>
   rediscovering the neighboring mountain ranges.
</P>
<P>
   That's my dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``...wouldn't want to clear anything more than what's absolutely
necessary,'' I hear my friend say, ``just enough for a view.'' The
man with the mountain agrees. I listen long enough to learn
there'll be a laundry, a garage, and a workshop on the basement
level. That's OK by me. Never did like the idea of living in a
cellar.
</P>
<P>
   But I have other things to think about. I picture a deep bathtub
next to a wall of windows, an island cooktop facing the fireplace;
a hammock on the screened porch; and of course, guest quarters for
kids and grandkids. I can see it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``...and I know you'll love it here.'' It's later that night,
and
</P>
<P>
   true to my word, I have called my son back and am bringing him
up to speed on my day. He, meanwhile, is filling me in on his day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put a lot of thought into this today,'' he states in some
</P>
<P>
   newly acquired ponderous voice, ``and I'm concerned. What if you
get sick? What if you get snowed in? What if you run the Bronco off
the road?'' I say it's sweet of him to care but he'll have to skip
the worrying part because I'm going to do it anyway. He sounds
confused _ probably because his weighty tone has failed to
intimidate me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, Babe,'' I explain, ``I'm fearless, and as long as I'm
</P>
<P>
   capable of remembering you as a little boy with poopy pants,
I'll be in charge of my life. I appreciate it, but I'll let you
know when I need help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' he agrees, almost too quickly. Then he zings one in on
me. ``Mom, there's no garbage pick-up on mountain tops. Have you
thought about that?''
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't. Now what?

 &HT;    COLUMN: Charge of `Eurocentrism' misses the point about
classical music
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It will disappoint some people to learn that Fats
Waller played Bach.
</P>
<P>
   The great jazz pianist played Bach when he was alone and wanted
to reach, through music, a higher realm of understanding.
</P>
<P>
   This would not surprise Gov. Zell Miller. It is only his critics
who would have trouble explaining it. There have always been
ignoramuses for whom classical music was culturally defined. But
now we find out it is racial as well, something suited to this race
but toxic to that one. Maybe it's in the melanin.
</P>
<P>
   When the governor proposed giving families of Georgia newborns a
classical music recording, he could have anticipated the gibing of
Rush Limbaugh and Jay Leno, know-nothings whose chief function is
to provide wit for the witless. What must have caught him off guard
was being accused of racism.
</P>
<P>
   You never know what land mines await your unwary step. The more
innocent the gesture, the more hurtful its rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   But free-floating hatred is indiscriminate, smearing anyone
within range. Even, sometimes, those whom the hateful would exalt.
Thus when Richard Kenyada of Lithonia wrote a letter to the
Constitution accusing Miller of ``Eurocentrism,'' he did a
disservice to a musician who would disavow him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd put (Duke) Ellington up against Mozart any day,'' Kenyada
wrote. ``Once again, black children will be force-fed a European
standard of excellence. It's taken hundreds of years for
African-Americans to overcome the indoctrination of the European
standard of beauty. Just when Americans appear to be on the brink
of accepting diversity, here we go again with another racial
cleansing in the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Here we go again is right. It's more racism and more
``Eurocentrism,'' force-fed in the nursery.
</P>
<P>
   It would be uncharitable to take this gentleman seriously,
except that he is representative of a view pandered to at every
turn. Another letter writer, taking issue not only with Miller but
also with Einstein and Galileo, saw no benefit to an early exposure
to classical music. ``My musical tastes have not changed as my
income has increased over the years,'' wrote Yuseff Shabazz of
College Park. ``I was not particularly fond of classical music
before, and I am not fond of it now. Income does not determine
musical taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Income? Miller said nothing about income. He simply said _ as
many others before him have said _ that the brain picks up sound
patterns in its earliest development, even in the womb, and that
the more complex, more sophisticated those patterns, the more
neural connections are made in the brain's circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   It's long been known that learning mathematics, especially, can
be facilitated by the kind of circuit building that listening to
classical music provides. As Miller said, ``Einstein knew it.
Galileo knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Richard Kenyada doesn't, what can one say? But there is
nothing ``Eurocentric'' about it. At a minimum, Kenyada needs to
define that word. And after that he needs to get right with Duke
Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say something like that is insulting to Ellington because
he had the highest regard for classical music,'' says Matt Schudel,
a writer and jazz critic for the Fort Lauderdale (Fla.)
Sun-Sentinel. ``He himself composed classical pieces.'' For what
it's worth, Schudel considers Ellington perhaps the greatest
composer America has produced. He was also a man of strong racial
feelings, but one who never let himself be made into a spokesman
for his race.

   ``He rose above that,'' Schudel says. ``In his autobiography,
`Music Is My Mistress,' he said, `My people are people who like
music. My people are people all over the world.'''
</P>
<P>
   And neither was Ellington an exception among the great jazz
musicians, so many of whom were black. ``Fats Waller loved to play
J.S. Bach on the piano when he was at home,'' Schudel says. ``And
Art Tatum, who is considered the greatest jazz pianist, worked
classical motifs into his music. Wynton Marsalis is as much a
classical musician as a jazz musician. Miles Davis attended the
Juilliard School of Music.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not only the jazz musicians, but musicians of any artistic
aspiration. Consider the pianist Andre Watts. Or Marian Anderson
and Leontyne Price. ``And,'' Schudel says, ``look at Paul Robeson,
for God's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   If they, too, were ``Euro-centric,'' then we all are. Or we
should wish we were.

 &HT;    Recording CDs adds twist with audio option
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philips suggests that you dig out those old records, pile up
your compact discs and make yourself the customized sets of music
that you've always wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Philips also suggests that a good way to do this is by
purchasing the company's CDR870, the second in the company's line
of CD recorders, which lets consumers make digital recordings from
CDs, vinyl long-playing records and even live music.
</P>
<P>
   The recording of CDs got its start, of course, as a way to
compile huge piles of data that you either couldn't store in your
computer, needed to transfer to another computer or just plumb
wanted to protect from a computer crash. With the Philips machine
and others like it, the whole notion of recording your own CDs
seems to be making a leap into the world of consumer audio.
</P>
<P>
   The recording of straight data continues, but the software has
improved dramatically, making it much easier to record music _ from
digital or analog LPs. In fact, CD recorder drives will probably
soon be built-in features for personal computers. The external
drives are now selling for as little as $300.
</P>
<P>
   The technology now permits, not just customized copying, but the
ability to cut unwanted noise on the original. The Philips machine,
while twice as expensive as the external drive, is built for use as
a music recorder that will be part of the user's stereo system. The
suggested retail price for CDR870 is $649, but an alert observer of
national mail-order houses might find it listed for under $600.
</P>
<P>
   The Philips works with either the CD-R discs that can only be
recorded once or the much more expensive CD-RW format, the
rewriteable discs that can be re-recorded more than 1,000 times.
</P>
<P>
   Recording industry executives snarl if you mention the idea of
passing along the copies at a profit. However, they sigh and
acknowledge that they will accept consumer use of copying
techniques for personal use. But how much work do you want to do to
make a copy? The devices and software are still ``as much labor as
love,'' according to The New York Times. ``The user may need to
spend three or four times as much time as the length of the music
being recorded to make a successful CD. And that does not take into
account planning and learning time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can let someone else make the darned CD. There
are services like Custom Revolutions (http://www.customdisc.com)
that will make a CD for you from their own catalog. The drawback to
that is that their catalog may not match your tastes quite as much
as those hundreds of old records gathering dust in your basement.
</P>
<P>
   Truth and drudgery
</P>
<P>
   It's been a bad time for print.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, print journalists might have self-righteously
turned up their noses at the likes of Matt Drudge, author of the
Drudge Report, which has become one of the Internet's hottest
sites. After Drudge ran several problematic stories about the
Clinton White House, the cheerleaders of print might have sniffed
that rumor-mongering was a poor substitute for real journalism.
</P>
<P>
   But then came June and July. The New Republic admitted that a
writer made up scads of things, including companies he was writing
about. The Boston Globe fired an acclaimed columnist for making up
quotes and the people who supposedly said them. Then last week, The
Cincinnati Enquirer canned a reporter after announcing that he had
stolen voice mail messages that were used in an investigative
series on Chiquita.
</P>
<P>
   We seem to have proven that print is fallible. What about the
Net?
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the big picture, the first issue of Brill's Content
has a voluminous story about press coverage of the Monica Lewinsky
matter. That piece, written by Stephen Brill, is bitterly critical
of print, Net and broadcast, slamming everyone from Drudge to Sam
Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   But tucked away in that same issue of Brill's Content is author
and near-ubiquitous Net guru Esther Dyson. She says the Net is all
about the end of ``the official story,'' the take on events that
was once controlled by authorities in Warsaw, Wall Street and
Washington. ``The guys who talk back to the advertisements, the
dissidents, the disgruntled employees and whistle-blowers, the
cranks and the truth-tellers _ all have found their medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson suggests neither glorification nor vilification of the
Net. Instead, she says that people should exercise their own
quality control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as consumers now expect labels and other information on
the goods they buy, they need to start looking for the same kind of
disclosure on their information,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   No, she doesn't want an official government certification, a
stamp on information. The responsibility lies elsewhere, she says.
``Yes, there is an information market for the truth. But it will
work only if we have educated citizens, demanding disclosure and
able to judge for themselves what is true.''

 &HT;    Tech Tools: Compressed archive files need a ZIP to get going
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Every so often someone asks me what to do with a ZIP
file, that is, a file with a .ZIP extension.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sure sign that people are still buying their first
computers without any prior experience, because ZIP files have been
with us about as long as modems, and the current popularity of the
Internet has made them even more prominent.
</P>
<P>
   A ZIP file is an archive file, often consisting of several
different files that have been compressed and packed into a single
file with the .ZIP extension.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of archiving is to make large files into smaller
ones. This can be done for storage purposes, but it is most
commonly done for transmission of binary files over telephone
lines. The amount of space saved depends on the type of files. Text
files are rarely zipped. Graphic files such as .JPG, .GIF, .EPS,
and so forth, are already compressed and little if anything is
gained by zipping them.
</P>
<P>
   There are an amazing number of ZIP programs commercially
available now; ZipMagic from Mijenix is a good one. WinZip is a
common shareware program.
</P>
<P>
   The original programs, and the programs whose code is included
in all these latter-day commercial programs, are PKZIP.EXE and its
counterpart, PKUNZIP.EXE. They were marketed as shareware by PKWARE
Inc. in 1989. Nowadays, as far as I can tell, it's considered
freeware unless you plan to use it commercially. PKZIP, which makes
the ZIP file, and PKUNZIP, which extracts the original files from
it, can be found just about anywhere on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, relatively primitive programs, still stuck in
DOS command line mode, and they take more effort to use than most
folks are willing to put forth. If you have downloaded a .ZIP file,
for instance, and along with it procured PKUNZIP.EXE, you want to
put them both in the same directory to avoid a real hassle. If all
you wish to do is extract the binary files from the archive, you
open a DOS window, go to the proper directory and first type the
name of the program, i.e., PKUNZIP. Then type a space and the name
of the archive file, which might be, for instance, ARCHIV.ZIP.
</P>
<P>
   The program will then pull out all the compacted files into the
same directory. It will do a lot more things, and to find out about
them, you simply type the name of the program without giving it a
file to take apart. It will show a fairly comprehensive list of
switches and commands.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you're going to do a lot of this and you aren't
comfortable typing commands in a DOS window, you might as well get
one of the commercial archiving programs. They all use PKWARE's
basic programs _ WINZIP even requires that PKUNZIP.EXE be available
for some operations _ but they make it easy and intuitive to use
the fancy stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers, i.e., those who have been messing with computers for
more than 10 years, will recall that PKWARE once had competition.
Its main adversary was LHARC, made by Haruyasu Yoshizaki and first
distributed in 1988. Its files had the extension .LHZ or LHC.
</P>
<P>
   It had the original advantage of being able to make a
self-extracting file, in other words, an archive file with an .EXE
extension that could be unarchived simply by executing it. That's
now possible with the other programs that unzip files. You still
see LHARC used on program distribution disks occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is more than almost anyone would want to know
about ZIP files and archivers in general, but if I don't explain
things in some detail, I run almost no chance of making a mistake,
thus disappointing many readers.

 &HT;    MEXICAN GENERAL MOTORS WORKERS START TO FEEL SQUEEZE OF U.S.
STRIKE
 &HT;    With photos to be placed in the International folder on the Cox
Server by the Austin American-Statesman.
 &HT;    EDs: Silao is about 200 miles northwest of Mexico City.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SILAO, Mexico _ People in this obscure town in Mexico are
discovering that the fickle global economy can give, yet suddenly
take away.
</P>
<P>
   The month-long strike of General Motors Corp. workers in the
United States has rolled into Silao, a city of 30,000 in Guanajuato
state that is home to cowboys, corn and vegetable fields -- as well
as a sprawling GM truck-production factory that's become a company
showcase in just six years.
</P>
<P>
   To the consternation of striking American workers, GM has big
plans for expanding this plant about 200 miles northwest of Mexico
City, along with other GM facilities in Mexico that churn out
pickups, Suburbans, trendy sport-utility vehicles and other autos
mostly for the American market.
</P>
<P>
   But right now a lack of parts from the United States has
rendered the Silao plant of some 2,500 workers mostly idle, and the
quiet that blankets the normally bustling factory signals an
uncertain future for these workers and Mexico's booming auto
industry, considered a key ingredient to the country's economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard something about how workers in the United States
are upset because labor is cheaper here,'' said GM worker Pablo
Lopez Perez, wearing his official ``GM-Mexico'' sports shirt while
hanging around Silao's town square.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think there's work enough for everyone,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, there's little work on either side of
the border for GM workers.
</P>
<P>
   A strike that started on June 4 in Flint, Mich., over
subcontracting disputes and other grievances has had a chain
reaction far beyond the two plants involved. More than 161,000 GM
workers across North America are now idled due to lack of work,
some drawing salaries, others not.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of Silao's work force has been idled. Plants in
Toluca, near Mexico City, and at a large facility in Coahuila state
near the U.S. border are also facing cutbacks in production.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hardest hit of the GM plants are many of the 53
auto-parts factories run by Delphi Automotive, a GM subsidiary.
These factories, which produce for other companies as well, have
mushroomed in northern Mexico recently courtesy of Mexico's
domestic investment reforms and the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
   This growth has made GM and Delphi Mexico's largest private
employers, with more than 84,000 employees combined.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Delphi workers are on mandatory summer vacation now. But
before vacations kicked in, Delphi was forced to idle 29,905 of its
72,000 employees. Many still are receiving full salaries that are
sometimes less than $10 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Lopez Perez, who makes about $13 a day plus medical
care and housing subsidies, was told to go home along with most of
the other GM workers in Silao. He is receiving 50 percent of his
pay, and worried about how long he and his family of four can last.
</P>
<P>
   So is Silao's mayor, Luis Gerardo Baldovinos, who says the
municipality of Silao is losing 25 to 30 percent of its sales
revenues now because so many workers are laid off and have less
money to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Guanajuato state could lose 10 to 15 percent of its sales
revenues, Baldovinos added.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this doesn't get better, we're going to have to go to the
United States to look for work, even without papers,'' the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't mince words when it came to assessing the GM strike,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a hunger for work here,'' Baldovinos said. ``I think
the unions in the United States are very peculiar. They are abusing
the kindness of American policies and making too many demands . . .
I hope that those gentlemen, with all due respect, with stop being
lazy and get back to work so the rest of us can get back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   These are fighting words to American auto workers, who fear a
continuous bleeding of jobs into Mexico, where labor costs are a
fraction what they are in the United States. The United Auto
Workers union has also accused GM of failing to invest in U.S.
factories to keep them sufficiently competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jaime Herrera, who follows the auto industry for
LatinSource of Mexico City, says U.S. auto workers have reason to
be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   GM, he said, has plans to pour 20 percent of a $5 billion
worldwide expansion plan for the next few years into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   GM spokesman Joe Jacuzzi said that because GM needs to protect
its competitive edge, he couldn't comment on the company's specific
plans for growth anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Herrera said GM is not alone in its aggressive stance.
Nissan is expanding in Mexico, along with Ford, Volkswagen and
other foreign companies who are taking advantage of the benefits of
NAFTA and Mexico's cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   GM, Delphi and other foreign companies are at the heart of
Mexico's explosion in auto manufacturing, whose output leaped by 30
percent in 1997 to generate more than one-fifth, or $20 billion, of
Mexico's exports.
</P>
<P>
   The GM strike in the United States hasn't stalled business'
optimism for continued growth in Mexico's auto industry. But it has
certainly applied some brakes to newly prosperous communities like
Silao.
</P>
<P>
   Store owners in the town are starting to grumble about fewer
customers. And at least one restaurant, La Bonita, which used to
serve mostly GM workers waiting for company buses, decided it was
more profitable to simply close its doors and wait to see what
happens.

DRESDEN, Germany: 1994 elections. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lutz Fischer, for instance, had been a driver in a state company
in the former East Germany. Now he runs two vans delivering
ice-cream on a contract from a big ice-cream company. In 1990, he
said, he voted Christian Democrat ``because they made the most
promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the 1994 elections, he said ``four years seemed a short
time and you couldn't expect them to do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem is that nothing has changed,'' he said. So
this time he said he will not plan to vote for Kohl though _ like
many eastern Germans _ he was not quite sure whom he would support.
Even some of Kohl's stalwart western German supporters are
hesitating. ``This election is a real dilemma for us,'' said Josi
Kraemer, a prosperous housewife in Bonn. ``Kohl has been there too
long. But who else is there for people like us?''
</P>
<P>
   Younger people, too, sense a disenchantment in many parts of
eastern Germany. In one recent, local vote in Saxony-Anhalt, many
swerved to the extreme right. Some are heading left.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought Helmut Kohl was right to insist on this
rapid reunification, this rapid change,'' said Christian Bernius, a
27-year-old law clerk, who plans to vote Social Democrat. ``In
fact, there was a rapid change on paper, but not in people's heads.
Division is going on longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite Germany's nominal unity, the election campaign
is being fought as two.
</P>
<P>
   In the west, where the bulk of Germany's voters show stable
voting patterns, Christian Democratic strategists are waging a
``red scare'' campaign, accusing Schroeder of working hand-in-glove
with closet Communists in the east.
</P>
<P>
   But in the east, where the challenge is to convince voters that
they never had it so good under communism, the aim is to win back
those who believe reunification _ personified in Kohl _ has made
them second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian Democrats have written off the east,'' said
Raimund Grafe, a strategist for the opposition Social Democrats.
And, said Joachim Herz, the former director of the Dresden State
Opera, ``what do you expect to achieve by constantly telling 15
million people that everything they did was wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, though, reflects a demographic and political
reality: Germany's national elections are fought for the hearts and
souls of the big, rich states of the west, where the population is
four times that of the east, and where voters chafe increasingly at
financing the east.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the east, voters are far less entrenched in their
party preferences. While 80 percent of western voters display a
stubborn party loyalty, government statistics show, only about half
the easterners show the same fidelity. And they are far more likely
to follow their pocketbooks than any sense of political obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in mayoral votes in two Saxon towns _ Leipzig
and Goerlitz _ the Christian Democrats were trounced. Last April,
in the small, eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, Kohl's party suffered
its worst-ever post-war defeat, in a state assembly election hat
produced a sizeable and troubling showing of around 13 percent for
the far-right German People's Union. One fifth of the vote,
moreover, went to former Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Christian Democrats in Bonn have taken to
castigating the easterners' seeming proclivity for voting for
extremes, and for displaying little of the gratitude that
westerners expect in return for paying a hated 7.5 percent income
tax surcharge to finance the eastern revival.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate issue in eastern Germany, though, is jobs. At
unification, the communist command economy was rudely dismantled,
the German mark became the currency, and an entire way of
state-sponsored living collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   But the paradox here is that the vaunted western investment in
modern and highly automated industries in eastern Germany has
provided none of the guaranteed jobs-for-life of state socialism.
``The more we modernize, the less jobs there are,'' Hahle said
glumly.
</P>
<P>
   In the eastern state of Thuringia, for instance, a General
Motors plant producing Opel cars is a triumph of reunification that
was a stop on President Clinton's tour last May.
</P>
<P>
   The sub-text, though, is that the plant, now employing around
2,000 people, replaced an old East German plant that provided five
times as many jobs and produced half as many cars.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern is repeated across the east and the most troubling
aspect is that it has produced an entire sub-class of
50-something-year-olds who may never work again. Roughly one fifth
of the eastern work-force is out of a job _ twice the western
figure. Overall, German unemployment has been stuck at post-war
record highs for months.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what was taken for granted in the old communist east _
the broad social network, free child care, artificial full
employment _ is now glimpsed through the rose-tint of loss,
paradoxically outweighing gains such as freedom and hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, it gives no one in Bonn pause for thought that,
eight years later, there is a nostalgia for the old east which no
one would have thought possible or imaginable in the days of the
German Democratic Republic, when we constantly cursed our fate,''
said Herz, the former director of the Dresden State Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Come September, said Heitmann, the justice minister, ``it will
be a lot'' if the Christian Democrats are able to hang on to the
seats that proved so valuable to Kohl in 1994. ``It could still be
that the east will tip the scales again,'' he said, though he did
not say in which direction.

BILINGUAL EDUCATION MUST FOCUS ON ENGLISH 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY M. ROSENFELD

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Arguments about whether to educate the children
of immigrants in their own language in America's public schools are
an aspect of a glaring reality that is shaping the future of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   California, the state with the greatest number of immigrants,
may have voted recently to scale back bilingual instruction to one
year, but the fact remains that 1 in 10 of everyone in this country
was not born here, a trend that is expected to hold at least steady
in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, bilingual education is merely a part of the larger
issue of how best to absorb the multitude of newcomers, which in
this decade will exceed the numbers that entered this country
during this century's first 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   By far, the largest group of immigrants in our own time comes
from Latin America, with substantial numbers from Asia and the
Caribbean, and comparatively fewer from Europe, the primary source
of the earlier immigrations.
</P>
<P>
   Then and now, the reason for their coming is to improve the
quality of their lives, just as the reason for their being welcomed
is that they power the nation's economic engine.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, bilingual instruction was adopted by the
educational establishment. It made sense, on the face of it.
Anything that would help turn the children of immigrants into
English-speakers would facilitate their becoming, in due course,
fully participating citizens of this nation.
</P>
<P>
   But what appeared to be happening, to those critics of
bilingualism who were not merely expressing traditional nativist
reaction to the newcomers, was that instead of helping the kids to
learn English quickly, too many bilingual programs were focusing on
providing continuing, open-ended instruction in the native tongues.
</P>
<P>
   What the nonideological critics saw happening was the de facto
establishment of schooling in a foreign language (usually Spanish)
underwritten by the American taxpayer. Hispanic parents in large
numbers also began to object because they saw that their kids, far
from learning the English they were supposed to in these bilingual
programs, were coming out of school unequipped with the language
skills needed for them to make it in America.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the distortion of what essentially is a practical
idea is that an administrative bureaucracy had found a good thing
in bilingualism and wanted to expand it with ever more bountiful
government stipends. Moreover, with the growth of identity
politics, it was a way to have public money to help sustain the
ethnic separateness of the immigrant groups.
</P>
<P>
   It was my good luck to arrive in the United States as an
immigrant boy nearly 60 years ago. At the time, there was no
thought of bilingual instruction. Within four months after stepping
off the gangplank, equipped only with the English I had managed to
scrounge up on the playground, I found myself as a 10-year-old in
the second grade. It was the only time in my life I was the tallest
boy in the class.
</P>
<P>
   Attentive teachers monitored my progress and moved me up as my
English improved. I never totally caught up and graduated from high
school as an 18-year-old, when most of my classmates were a year
younger.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, and cognizant of the presumption of arguing
from personal experience to a general principle, it is clear that
kids up to a certain age are capable of learning English quickly by
themselves. But there should be no objection to a program, of short
duration, that would help accelerate the learning.
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual education, however, would appear to be more essential
for older kids, upon whom scholastic demands fall heavily.
Bilingual education would seem to be a practical way to help them
keep up with their schoolwork as they gain English proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But the stress in bilingual education should be on the learning
of English, so the students could become totally integrated with
their peers. Such education deserves public support and
understanding. The beneficiaries are not only the people who
thereby are helped to live and work in their new country; it helps
just as much the country, which benefits from their coming into the
linguistic mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   But these programs need constant monitoring to make sure they
are not misused to become the means by which immigrant children are
effectively isolated for the sake of enhancing ethnic identity.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the business of government. Rather, that is for the
immigrant families to do for themselves, through whatever community
groups they wish to establish and fund.
</P>
<P>
   The great motto of this successful republic, built from the
ground up by the sweat labor of generations of immigrants, is ``E
pluribus unum'' _ one out of many.

HARD TIMES EVERYWHERE BUT CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Almost half a million acres of Florida have
burned in the last week, and the news coverage of embattled
homeowners and firefighters has been very familiar to Californians.
We feel a gut sympathy for Floridians in peril.
</P>
<P>
   One thing has been missing, though. I'm still waiting to hear
those phrases you hear whenever California burns, shakes or slides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in a land of illusions.'' ``Denying ecological
reality.'' ``Why do people live there?''
</P>
<P>
   Those phrases all apply to people living in developments in the
Florida woods, but when disaster hits them, the media and ordinary
folk refrain from lectures, smirks and comparisons to Biblical
plagues.
</P>
<P>
   As a friend puts it, ``When it happens somewhere else, it's hard
times. When it happens in California, we're getting our just
deserts.''
</P>
<P>
   As is so often pointed out, this state is largely just desert,
and we shouldn't be living here _ or at least not so many of us.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is largely swamp turned into subdivisions by greed, air
conditioning, bulldozers and chemicals. People _ or at least so
many of them _ shouldn't be living there either.
</P>
<P>
   But when Florida burns or is blown away by hurricanes, you won't
hear anyone say Floridians brought it on themselves, the way
Californians deserve fire, earthquakes and mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, swamps burn. It's part of nature, especially when
nature gives Florida the dry end of El Nino, another phenomenon
seen as part of God's wrath on California.
</P>
<P>
   California occupies a special, overdeveloped place in the
national imagination. Florida, for most Americans, is a great place
to visit a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   When Malibu, Calif., burns, it's a vision of celebrity hell.
When Mims, Fla., burns, it's just another disaster story.
</P>
<P>
   Here's wishing all of those good people luck with their
insurance companies _ the real plague upon all of us.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is America, and people have been shot over poker hands,
sheep grazing and gang signs, but over a Tweety Bird?
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, eight people were shot and wounded at
the Alameda County (Calif.) Fair because of an argument over who
got the last giant stuffed Tweety Bird at a carnival booth.
</P>
<P>
   You can see how the Tweety Bird shootings would come down. He or
she is a damned cute big-headed yellow descendant of dinosaurs. In
the argument over Tweety someone got disrespected, punches were
thrown and a gun was drawn. What's the point of carrying a gun if
you don't draw it? And then use it?
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain logic to random acts of American violence, as
any middle-class American who has ever felt road rage will attest.
Dumb leads to dumber and misdemeanors lead to felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Funny what a difference an ocean makes. Anyone who has fought
for a lane in a car has to admit he can understand why people get
shot over a Tweety Bird. But despite our Klan history, very few
people in this country understand why men in Belfast get dressed up
and march through someone else's neighborhood to tick them off and
cause riots.
</P>
<P>
   Why, just because they've been doing it for centuries. And they
wear bowler hats, too, and sashes showing their allegiance to the
British crown, which would like nothing better than to keep them
from marching and burning their neighbors' churches.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes non-random violence is stranger than Tweety Bird
shootings.

NBA LOCKOUT: WHO CARES?

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the end, only three things of substance
separate man and woman from beast:
</P>
<P>
   _ An ability to bathe without an over-reliance on the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   _ A full appreciation for the way the Spice Girls, Kenny G,
Sinbad, Bobcat Goldthwaite, Howie Mandel, Urkel and Gallagher make
the world a better place to live.
</P>
<P>
   _ A need for a rooting interest in the outcome of sporting
events.
</P>
<P>
   A crocodile doesn't care if it's the slob with the ``I'm With
Stupid'' T-shirt or the slug with the ``Mama'' tattoo who jumps
into the river for a swim. A crocodile just wants somebody hit and
take the plunge. People _ being at the top of the evolutionary
scale, perhaps because they invented the scale _ need to make
emotional connections.
</P>
<P>
   People need to root for or against somebody. People need to
stand for or against something. People need to love or hate, for
better or worse, for good reasons or bad. On blessed occasions,
along comes somebody like Howard Cosell for people to unashamedly
love or hate.
</P>
<P>
   Passions run particularly high when it comes to matters of
national loyalty, like in the Olympics or the World Cup.
(Americans, for their part, appear to be above great partisanship
when it comes to the World Cup. This might have something to do
with the fact that it's easier to find a sportswriter who doesn't
have mustard stains on his shirt than it is an American who knows
what sport the World Cup involves. As far as most American men are
concerned, the World Cup is the greatest hope yet of ensuring that
they will never become falsettos against their will.)
</P>
<P>
   The point is, people aren't going to get involved in something
unless they have a reason _ whimsical as it may be _ to care. One
way or another. It can be for as simple a reason as hating a team's
uniforms (See: the heretofore dignified Los Angeles Dodgers, who
have fallen under the evil influence of Fox and now wear slow-pitch
softball blue jerseys).
</P>
<P>
   So what happens when the resistible force meets the contemptible
object? What happens when the National Basketball Association
owners and players draw a line in the sand that could eliminate a
sizable chunk of next season? What happens when greedy owners and
equally greedy players try to pass on their labor pains to
long-suffering fans?
</P>
<P>
   The owners began what has the makings of a long, bitter dispute
last week by locking their doors to the players. Under the terms of
a lockout, teams cannot have contact with players, conduct contract
negotiations or run summer camps. Players cannot use team
facilities. Oh, and players don't get paid.
</P>
<P>
   Though three years remain in the current labor agreement, the
owners are within their rights to shut down operations. A clause in
the current labor agreement allows owners to re-open discussions if
more than 51.8 percent of the league's basketball-related income
goes to player salaries. Players took in 57 percent of that income
this past season, with no end to the escalation in sight. Even
Hollywood is smarter about the way it does business.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Titanic'' had been made with 57 percent of the money going
to the cast, James Cameron would have had to do the filming on the
S.S. Minnow. At the center of the NBA labor dispute is the Larry
Bird exception to the salary cap. Life is too short to get immersed
in the minutiae of the Bird exception. Suffice to say, the Bird
exception allows teams to re-sign their free agents without regard
to the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Bird exception, 24 of 29 teams exceeded the NBA
salary cap of $26.9 million. The Bulls managed to sign Michael
Jordan to a $33.1 million contract last season when they were
already over the salary cap. Kevin Garnett and _ gulp _ Alonzo
Mourning became $100 million players.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, in other words, see the salary cap as a dunce cap.
Still, it's hard to feel anything but contempt for the owners when
Jerry Reinsdorf _ one of the hard-liners during the baseball strike
that wiped out the 1994 World Series _ is among their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   For an idea of how NBA owners do business, consider the New York
Knicks. Despite the lockout, the Knicks are demanding full payment
up front for 1998-98 season tickets. That would be the same Knicks
ownership that has raised ticket prices for courtside seats from
$500 apiece to $1,350 in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Not that a players' union that serves as apologist and enabler
for the likes of Latrell Sprewell, Isaiah Rider and Chris Webber
inspires anything but contempt. The union stance is that owners
don't have to pay the exorbitant player salaries. Right. All a team
has to do is make a stand, and fans will understand. And if the
owners all agreed to hold the line on salaries, especially those of
free agents, they'd get taken to court for collusion faster than
you can say Donald Fehr.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't good for the league when Garnett can turn up his nose
at a $103 million offer from the Minnesota Timberwolves when he
hasn't even been in the league three years. Garnett eventually
deigned to stay with the Timberwolves for $121 million over six
years, then said it wasn't about the money.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, the players only seem interested in being business
partners with the owners when it comes to reaping the benefits.
When it comes to doing something that is in the best interest of
the league as a whole, they say it's the owners' problem. ``We're
strong,'' said Knicks center Patrick Ewing, now the president of
the Players Association. ``We believe in what we're doing. We're
fighting for our rights.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ewing speaks, you can hardly even see the lips of agent
David Falk move. Ewing spent the first decade of his career
collecting his money, doing nothing off the court to promote the
league. And then, when the prospect of the $18 million balloon
payments began drying up, he turns into Samuel Gompers.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing soaring faster than NBA ticket prices is the
mediocrity of the product.
</P>
<P>
   I say the longer the lockout lasts, the better. I say the
players and owners will feel the pain of labor dispute before fans
do. I say the players and owners should stay in hiding until they
settle their greedy differences. By then, they might even be able
to find somebody who still cares.

RESPITE STAYS CAN OFFER BREAK FOR LOVED ONES AND THEIR CAREGIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARA JAKES  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A month shy of 101 years, Augusta Boyd needs some
looking after. A nursing home is out of the question, said Dennis
Tillman, her godson. He and his girlfriend would rather take care
of Boyd at their home.
</P>
<P>
   But they need a break sometimes. So recently, the truck driver
took Boyd to the Ann Lee Home for a respite stay during his
weeklong vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She showed me a lot of love in raising me, and I'm just
showing my love in return,'' Tillman, 38, said of his decision to
care for Boyd at home. ``That's what being a family is all about _
taking care of your own, not putting them in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``But respite care comes in handy. I don't know how I would do
it all without it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Tillman and an estimated 7 million other unpaid caregivers
nationwide, respite programs are a boon. They provide short-term
stays for ailing loved ones and some needed time off for their
families.
</P>
<P>
   As the vacation season heats up, beds for respite care are in
greatest demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to let the caregiver get some time away,'' said
Marty Haase, executive director of the Caregivers Respite Program
of Catholic Charities in Albany. ``They'll get into the role of
caring for their loved ones and forget about caring for themselves.
The caregivers can get seriously ill, and then you've got two
people who need medical attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But just like making a reservation for a room at a popular
hotel, Haase said, ``You've got to get it before it gets booked.''
</P>
<P>
   With more people living longer, the fastest-growing age group
nationally is 85 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Respite care is not just for people who live with the elderly.
Those who look after disabled relatives need that break, too.
</P>
<P>
   At the Center for the Disabled in Albany, the overnight respite
program is booked through August, said Joseph M. MacBeth, director
of the special education program. The center has 10 respite beds on
weekends for people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The program is funded with an annual state grant, which has
remained at $215,000 for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could double that, we could run 20 beds _ there's a
really high need,'' he said. ``There's not a lot of respite options
out there, and some families don't know it exists at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Caring for loved ones at home costs far less than nursing
facilities, which makes respite programs even more attractive.
Regular respite care can be as low as $50 per day. If medical care
is required, respite costs may run as high as $200 a day. Some
programs accept Medicaid. Compared to nursing homes and live-in
nursing care _ which can charge $60,000 a year _ respite can be a
real deal.
</P>
<P>
   Social workers recommend that caregivers take advantage of
respite care even when they're not going out of town. Barbara
Wazny, a referral specialist with Senior Services of Albany, said
sometimes a single day off really makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of hard work and dedication _ it really builds
on you,'' Wazny said. ``People don't realize how important it is to
take a day off, or take a vacation.''

NORTH FACE GAINS STAKE IN ITALIAN COMPANY, PLANS MOVE TO COLORADO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The North Face Inc., the sportswear company that
has made a name for itself selling serious mountaineering gear, has
acquired the majority stake in an Italian outdoor footwear company
and is moving the bulk of its headquarters to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the purchase, San Leandro, Calif.-based North Face
agreed to pay $6.6 million plus 20 percent in interest immediately
and another 31 percent over the next two to five years to gain a 51
percent share of La Sportiva S.r.L. of Ziano de Fiemme, Italy. To
obtain the company's U.S. distribution rights, North Face will
spend $3 million for independently owned La Sportiva, USA, the
Italian company's American spinoff, based in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   North Face said it will maintain its financial operations in San
Leandro, but move the rest of the business to Carbondale, Colo., to
save money.
</P>
<P>
   While the move and the newly purchased company both have
Colorado connections, North Face and analysts say they are
unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcements by North Face were the latest in a series
of changes for the 33-year-old company, which in May named James
Fifield chief executive, replacing William Simon, who is now
serving as vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Fifield) came in and said he was going to shake things up
and he's done that,'' said Shawn Milne, a research analyst for
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco. ``There's an opportunity for
North Face to expand.''
</P>
<P>
   Milne approved of the acquisition of La Sportiva, which makes
specialized, high-end footwear for such activities as rock climbing
and mountaineering. ``These are very technical products that would
have taken North Face several years to develop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The timing also appears to coincide nicely with the announcement
in June of North Face's own brand of running foot gear. North Face
will start shipping its brand-name footwear in the fall and will
co-brand the La Sportiva label, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   North Face, which moved to San Leandro from Berkeley in 1995,
will shift its marketing, research and top executives to Colorado
next month.
</P>
<P>
   James Reilly, the company's chief operating officer, said 70
employees would move from San Leandro to a leased property in
Carbondale in August, where added staff will bring the total number
of employees to 90 or 95. Carbondale is about a half-hour drive
from Aspen, where Fifield owns a house.
</P>
<P>
   About 175 employees will remain in San Leandro, even after the
company builds a new corporate headquarters on 36 acres it is
negotiating to buy in Carbondale. The newly built headquarters is
expected to open by late 1999 or the spring of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Face is making important strategic decisions in order to
grow our business and reduce costs,'' Fifield said in a statement
Monday. ``Our current corporate facility cannot accommodate our
future growth plans and attract talented executives in a
cost-effective manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Another attraction to Colorado is the mountainous terrain, which
is expected to be a testing ground for the company's equipment.
Nike Inc.'s ACG (All Conditions Gear) product line and
Adidas-Salomon AG have product testing centers in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   North Face stock trades on the Nasdaq exchange.

POWER COMPANIES OFFERING ALTERNATIVE ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two energy retailers competing in California's
recently deregulated electricity market have announced they will
provide solar and other renewable energy sources for customers.
</P>
<P>
   Green Mountain Energy Resources said Monday it had begun sales
of rooftop solar electric systems for homeowners. The photovoltaic
(PV) cells, producing electricity directly from the sun, will allow
customers to produce from 20 percent to 50 percent of their own
electricity, according to South Burlington, Vt.-based Green
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   And Enron Energy Services, a subsidiary of Houston-based energy
provider Enron Corp. said Monday it would provide renewable energy
for Patagonia Inc., the Ventura, Calif.-based outdoor clothing
company.
</P>
<P>
   Green Mountain entered into an agreement with Applied Power
Corp., based in Olympia, Wash., to design and install rooftop
systems, the two companies said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The PV systems cost from $4,750 to $7,450, depending upon
installation costs. However, rebates are available through the
California Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, California permits ``net metering,'' which provides
that electricity generated by homeowners can be sold at retail rate
back to a utility and becomes an earned credit on an electricity
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists argue that while the initial cost for a PV
system is expensive, it can pay for itself over time. Moreover,
Julie Blunden, who directs marketing efforts in California for
Green Mountain, said consumers have demonstrated a willingness to
pay premiums for renewable sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price is not the only factor customers consider. Our
lowest-priced power product is our least popular,'' she said.
``People want to buy cleaner electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Patagonia, meanwhile, becomes one of the first businesses in
California to commit to 100 percent wind energy.
</P>
<P>
   Enron plans to construct a 16-megawatt wind-power facility near
Palm Springs. Until the plant is complete in early 1999, Enron
Energy Services will supply all of Patagonia's electricity needs _
approximately one million kilowatt hours annually _ from a mix of
renewable sources in California. Once the new plant begins
commercial operations, Patagonia's power will be provided by Enron
Wind Corp.

SIGNING THE DECLARATION, THEN FADING INTO HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

<P>
   Who was the associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court who fled
to North Carolina to avoid arrest for unpaid debts that arose from
his land speculation? None other than one of the 56 signers of our
Declaration of Independence _ James Wilson of Pennsylvania
(1742-1798). Wilson was a member of the very first U.S. Supreme
Court when he skipped out on his creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wrote an influential pamphlet published in 1774 in which
he denied that the British Parliament had the legal authority to
make laws for the American colonies. Wilson also helped draft the
Pennsylvania Constitution and fought to get it adopted. When he
died, he was still a justice of the nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of the lesser-known delegates from the colonies who
signed that great document, the Declaration of Independence, offer
an interesting peek into that period of our history.
</P>
<P>
   Historian David Freeman Hawke, in his book, ``A Transaction of
Free Men: The Birth and Course of the Declaration of
Independence,'' relates an anecdote that shows the concern the
delegates had _ signing the great document might have been a death
warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Harrison (1726-1791) of Virginia was a stout man and
when he took up the pen to sign the vellum copy of the Declaration,
he said to the slender Elbridge Gerry (1744-1814) of Massachusetts:
``I shall have a great advantage over you, Mr. Gerry, when we are
all hung for what we are now doing. From the size and weight of my
body I shall die in a few minutes, but from the lightness of your
body, you will dance in the air an hour or two before you are
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morris (1734-1806), also of Pennsylvania, was a very
successful shipping merchant. Elected to be a delegate of the
Continental Congress, Morris voted against the Declaration of
Independence in July 1776 _ on the grounds that it was premature.
He changed his mind and signed it in August.
</P>
<P>
   Morris raised and borrowed money to finance George Washington's
Revolutionary forces. His efforts were so successful that he was
called the ``financier of the Revolution.'' In 1781, Congress
appointed Morris as superintendent of finance, which gave him
dictatorial powers over the nation's economy. He resigned that
position two years later.
</P>
<P>
   As politically powerful as Morris was, his personal land
speculation brought him financial ruin. Land values in the areas
west of the colonies plummeted. He couldn't pay his creditors.
Morris was arrested and confined in the Philadelphia debtors'
prison, ``Prune Street,'' for three years until he was released
under the federal bankruptcy law in 1801. He lived out his last
years supported by his wife's small annuity.
</P>
<P>
   George Read (1733-1798) of Delaware at first also refused to
vote for and sign the Declaration but did so after it was adopted.
But Delaware was the first state to ratify the Constitution, due to
Read's tireless efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McKean's (1734-1817) vote for the Declaration cancelled
Read's nay vote, but it left Delaware without a majority vote.
McKean sent a messenger for Caesar Rodney (1728-1784), Delaware's
third delegate, and he arrived in time to put the state on record
as supporting the document.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney, by the way, disputed that the Declaration of
Independence was signed on July 4, 1776. He insisted that no one
signed it on that date.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Hopkinson (1737-1791) of New Jersey was a composer who
wrote the first known piece of American secular music, a song
called ``My Days Have Been So Wondrous Free.'' He also wrote what
many musicologists consider to be the first American opera, ``The
Temple of Minerva.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight of those who signed the Declaration were born outside the
colonies: in England (Button Gwinnett and Robert Morris); in Wales
(Francis Lewis); in Ireland (James Smith, George Taylor and Matthew
Thorton); and in Scotland (James Wilson and John Witherspoon).
</P>
<P>
   William Whipple (1730-1785) of New Hampshire was a sea captain
at 21 years of age, running rum to Africa and returning to
Portsmouth with slaves. He quit the sea at the age of 29. Whipple
was elected as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1776 and
served the Congress for three years. Being a man of action, he took
lengthy sabbaticals from Congress in order to lead the New
Hampshire militia against the British as a brigadier general. He
led his troops to major victories in the battles of Stillwater and
Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   Gwinnett (1732-1777) of Georgia barely had time to sign the
Declaration before he was killed in a duel with American general
Lachlan McIntosh over who would command the revolutionary troops
from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Wolcott (1726-1797) of Connecticut, when returning from a
trip to New York, stole and transported a lead statue of King
George III in a wagon. George III was melted down for musket balls.
And as a brigadier general, Wolcott lead 14 regiments of militia
from his state to New York to help reinforce the Revolutionary Army
on the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Rush (1745-1813) of Pennsylvania was a doctor and the
first professor of chemistry in the colonies. In 1786 in
Philadelphia, he established the first free medical clinic and
founded the first American anti-slavery society.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Edward Smith points out in his biography, ``John Marshall:
Definer of a Nation,'' the impact George Wythe (1726-1806) of
Virginia had on Marshall's legal thinking. Marshall, arguably the
greatest jurist in American history, learned the depth and breadth
of the law and its social consequences in classes that Chancellor
Wythe taught at the College of William and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Wythe considered the college ``a training ground for republican
citizenship.'' Indeed it was. He not only taught the future Chief
Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, he taught future presidents _
Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe _ as well as the statesman Henry
Clay.
</P>
<P>
   Wythe died under mysterious circumstances in his 80th year. The
National Archives and Records Administration suggests that he was
poisoned by his grandnephew and heir, George Wythe Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining true to his long-held aversion to slavery, Wythe's
will freed his slaves upon his death.

FOUR GREAT BOOKS FOR A THRILLING READ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After plodding through a couple of clunkers, it was a real joy
to read four terrific books in a row.
</P>
<P>
   First out of the gate is Thomas Perry's outstanding ``The
Face-Changers'' (Random House, $24, 372 pages).
</P>
<P>
   For years, Jane Whitefield, a member of the Seneca tribe, has
been a guide who has helped people in trouble disappear. But
following her wedding to Dr. Carey McKinnon, she has promised to
retire from her very dangerous career.
</P>
<P>
   Whitefield settles into married life. Then, one night, McKinnon
asks her to come to the hospital and introduces her to his surgical
mentor, Dr. Richard Dahlman, who has been wounded trying to resist
arrest for the alleged murder of his partner. McKinnon believes
Dahlman is innocent and asks Whitefield to help Dahlman escape the
police and guide him to safety.
</P>
<P>
   But as Whitefield and Dahlman flee the hospital, Whitefield
spots two men who can only be professional assassins. And now
Whitefield knows their flight will not only be from the police but
also the assassins and the people who hired them.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlman's story is simple. In his 60s, he pretty much quit
performing operations to concentrate on pure research. He set up a
clinic with a female colleague. To finance Dahlman's work, his
partner, Dr. Sarah Hoffman, accepts an offer of $500,000 to give a
man a new face. After his release from the clinic, three of the
clinic's staff take new jobs in different parts of the country.
Then Hoffman is murdered and Dahlman gets framed. Eventually,
Whitefield learns that the other clinic staffers all died under
mysterious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Whitefield moves Dahlman across the country, always just
a few steps ahead of the hit squad and the FBI. And the only way to
ensure Dahlman's safety is to create a new identity for him and
find a place to stash him while she tracks down the man with the
new face and finds out who he hired to erase his past and all the
people who knew of his plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   To her horror, she will learn that the ``face-changers'' are
using her name and identity to ``destroy lives, not save them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Whitefield, Perry has created one of the smartest and most
engaging female characters in the thriller genre. His plot, as
always, is truly creative and will keep you guessing. The only
thing the reader knows for sure is that somehow Whitefield will
eventually win out. Perry just keeps getting better with each new
Whitefield saga.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Point of Origin.'' By Patricia Cornwell. G.P. Putnam's Sons.
$25.95. 356 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell's ninth forensic thriller featuring Dr. Kay Scarpetta,
Virginia's chief medical examiner, is the best yet.
</P>
<P>
   It's been five years since psychopathic killer Carrie Grethen
was incarcerated in a psychiatric center. Suddenly, Scarpetta gets
a rambling note from Carrie, who indicates she is not done with
causing mayhem for Scarpetta and those she loves _ her niece Lucy,
Carrie's former lover; and Scarpetta's lover, Benton Wesley, former
head of the FBI's profiling unit.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to leave for a week's vacation with Wesley, Scarpetta and
Richmond Police Capt. Peter Marino are summoned to a horrible fire
scene by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The fire
destroyed the rural estate of media tycoon Kenneth Sparkes.
Nineteen horses died in the stable fire, and Scarpetta and the ATF
team fear a body found in the destroyed house might be Sparkes.
</P>
<P>
   However, Scarpetta's autopsy finds the victim was a woman who
had been mutilated. Meanwhile, the FBI calls Wesley in as a
consultant when Carrie escapes from the psychiatric center.
Everyone knows that Scarpetta, Wesley and Lucy are all in grave
danger. At the same time, more mutilated bodies are found at fire
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Point of Origin'' moves with breathtaking, tension-building
pace. Cornwell instills more raw emotion in her well-developed
characters than in her previous works. And her villains are as
heinous as any that Stephen King has created. This thriller is
worth every penny of its $25.95 price.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Full Dress Gray.'' By Lucian Truscott. William Morrow &AMP; Co.
$25. 400 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Truscott's military thrillers always ring true, and ``Full Dress
Gray'' is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Cadet Ry Slaight caused a scandal at West
Point when he proved that a fellow cadet had been murdered by his
gay lover.
</P>
<P>
   Now Slaight is back at West Point, having been promoted to
lieutenant general and named the academy's superintendent. The day
after Labor Day, the full cadet corps passes in review to welcome
Slaight. Four cadets pass out in the heat, and one, 1st-Class Cadet
Dorothy Hamner, dies. The autopsy is inconclusive on the cause of
death, but it does reveal that Hamner had sex with multiple
partners the night before.
</P>
<P>
   The many-pronged investigation must uncover whether it was a
gang rape or a cadet orgy. Slaight locks horns with Brig. Gen. Jack
Gibson, the commandant of cadets, who is having an affair with
another officer's wife and has joined forces with a powerful
senator who wants to close down West Point.
</P>
<P>
   Slaight's daughter, Jacey, was Hamner's company commander.
Slowly she learns about the party Hamner attended the night before
she died, who was at the party, and eventually she is convinced
that Hamner was murdered. All the male cadets at the party are
members of West Point's Honor Committee, and Jacey's probe points
to their misusing their power. Eventually, she is kidnapped and
severely beaten.

   Slaight's mandate is to bring Hamner's murderer or murderers to
justice and save the academy and his daughter from powerful forces
within and without the academy.

<P>
   Truscott, who attended West Point, has created some very
complex, honorable characters, along with some really awful human
beings. The plot is realistic enough to be on tomorrow's front
page. The dialogue is believable and up to date, while the pace
moves briskly. Once again, Truscott delivers a first-rate thriller.

   ``Sisterhood of Spies _ The Women of the OSS.'' By Elizabeth P.
McIntosh. Naval Institute Press. $29.95. 256 pages.
</P>
<P>
   This is a wonderful addition to any World War II collection.
</P>
<P>
   Little has been written on the women who worked for the Office
of Strategic Services, the predecessor to the Central Intelligence
Agency. The author, who joined the OSS in 1943 and worked in Burma
and China, thankfully has righted that omission.
</P>
<P>
   Some were spies, like the elegant Virginia Hall. Before she
joined the OSS, she worked for the British Special Operations
Executive. Twice Hall, known as The Limping Lady, set up spy
networks in occupied France, and eventually her cover was blown.
The Gestapo so feared Hall that they issued this order: ``The lady
who limps is one of the most dangerous Allied agents in France. We
must find and destroy her.''
</P>
<P>
   When she switched to the OSS in 1944, her handlers were fearful
of sending her back to France, but twice she parachuted into France
and worked with the Resistance in getting downed Allied aviators to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Others had less glamorous but equally important jobs _
cryptographers, cartographers, analysts, recruiters of double
agents, propaganda experts and so on. Some were famous, like the
actress Marlene Dietrich. Others, like Julia Child, would become
famous in other careers after the war. All were courageous. Most
survived, but some did not.
</P>
<P>
   When McIntosh writes about individuals, the book sings.
``Sisterhood of Spies'' is a belated, but welcome, tribute to the
women who worked for Maj. Gen. William ``Wild Bill'' Donovan's OSS.

 By JAMES BROOKE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Coloradans sometimes feel they need a visa to visit Aspen. But,
behind the intimidating buzz of celebrities and high prices, Aspen
is a magical town where the beauty of the Elk Mountains combines
with an ever more stimulating cultural life.
 &HT;    Long known for winter sports, Aspen now reports its highest
hotel occupancies in August. Highlighting its increasingly cerebral
image, a survey by the Aspen Chamber Resort Association of last
summer's visitors found that half came for cultural events and only
one-fifth for outdoor recreation.
 &HT;    The survey also found that the average household income of
visitors was $131,000. But with almost two hotel beds (9,200) for
each of its 5,600 residents, it is possible to manage a stay on a
moderate budget.
 &HT;    A key to enjoying Aspen, an eminently walkable town, is to leave
your car behind. Parking is rare and expensive. Visitors who arrive
by air can take a van to town _ free from Aspen's airport, or $81
from Denver's airport, four hours away. Visitors arriving by car
can park free at the Aspen airport and take the 15-minute bus ride
into town.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The largest cultural draw of the summer is the Aspen Music
Festival, a miniature Tanglewood that draws as many as 1,700 people
to concerts under a blue-and-white tent set up across from Harris
Concert Hall, with seating inside and, free, on the lawn.
 &HT;    The festival began June 18 with the Starling Chamber Orchestra
performing Britten and Puccini, and will finish Aug. 16 with a
Prokofiev performance by the Aspen Festival Orchestra conducted by
James DePriest. Tickets are $8 to $50. Information: (970) 925-3254.
Tickets: (970) 925-9042.
 &HT;    Saturday afternoons until Aug. 15 there is a free festival
concert atop Aspen Mountain. Gondola tickets, $18, are required.
 &HT;    In July and early August, the students of the festival's school
also perform at the Wheeler Opera House, a beautifully restored
1889 building. This season's offerings include Mark-Anthony
Turnage's ``Greek'' (July 23 and 25) and Carlisle Floyd's
``Susannah'' (Aug. 4, 5, 7 and 8). Tickets, $17 (for ``Greek''),
$24 and $48; (970) 925-9042.
 &HT;    The opera house has also inherited events from Dance Aspen,
which went bankrupt last winter. A series of engagements July 22
through Aug. 15 features the Paul Taylor Dance Company, Les Ballets
Jazz de Montreal, the Parsons Dance Company and Ballet West.
Tickets are $15 to $48 from (970) 920-5770.
 &HT;    Aspen Theater in the Park will offer a full summer season in its
white tent in Rio Grande Park. The season, June 28 to Aug. 29,
rotates ``Forever Plaid'' by Stuart Ross, Neil Simon's ``Jake's
Women,'' ``The Nerd'' by Larry Shue and a children's show, ``The
Magician's Nephew.'' Tickets, $25 and $30 ($7 for ``Magician'') are
sold through the Wheeler, (970) 920-5770.
 &HT;    This week, Snowmass, Aspen's modern sister city, holds Janus
Jazz Aspen at Snowmass, a distinguished small festival, in its town
park, with tent and lawn seating for 5,500. Appearing Thursday to
Sunday is a lineup including Wynton Marsalis, the Headhunters with
Herbie Hancock, B.B. King, and Earth, Wind and Fire. Tickets: $20
to $100 from the Wheeler, (970) 920-5770.
 &HT;    The Aspen Institute, the nonprofit educational organization,
offers free lectures at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesdays in July and August at
Paepcke Auditorium on its campus. Speakers include the playwright
Wendy Wasserstein, July 28, and Murray Gell-Man, Nobel Prize winner
in physics, Aug. 18; (970) 925-7010.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    In Aspen, the mountains are accessible to all _ on an easygoing
gondola ride to the 11,212-foot-high summit of Aspen Mountain, a
moderately challenging bicycle ride down a secluded path, or a
crashing raft ride down the Roaring Fork River.
 &HT;    On busy summer weekends, the Silver Queen Gondola carries 2,000
people a day to the summit. It runs daily 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. At the
top, there are free, 45-minute guided nature walks daily, on the
hour from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., until Sept. 7.
 &HT;    The Sundeck restaurant is open for lunch every day, and for
dinner on Monday (Mexican) and Wednesday (barbecue), when the
gondola runs till 7:30. Gondola prices range from free for children
6 and under to $18 for adults on weekends. Dinner and gondola
combination is $8 to $25. For information, call (800) 525-6200.
 &HT;    Bicycle paths abound in Aspen. My family and I rented bikes at
Aspen Velo, one of at least nine bicycle renters in town. We rode
down a riverfront path to Woody Creek Tavern, about six and a half
miles one way. A four-hour rental is $22, helmet included; (888)
925-1495.
 &HT;    Hiking is another popular activity. A favorite route is the
two-mile Maroon Lake Scenic Trail, which is accessible by bus from
the Rubey Park transportation center in town. Information: Aspen
Chamber of Commerce, (970) 925-1940.
 &HT;    Rafting on the area's rivers is a fast-growing recreation sport.
Among the rafting companies in the area are Inland Drifters, (970)
963-7438, which charges $45 a person a half day or $75 for a full
day, and runs class 1 through class 4 rapids (6 is the most
difficult), and Blazing Adventures, (800) 282-7238, which charges
$65 to $78 for class 1 through 5.
 &HT;    Children enjoy exploring Ashcroft, a semirestored ghost town on
Castle Creek Road, 30 minutes from downtown. The Aspen Historical
Society gives free tours at 11 a.m., 1 and 3 p.m. every day but
Monday.
 &HT;    On rainy days, tours of Aspen's two silver mines, Smuggler and
Compromise, offer instructive insights into the city's origins (but
children must be 5 or older).
 &HT;    At Smuggler, visitors walk a quarter-mile into a mountain that,
in 1894, provided the world's largest silver nugget: 1,840 pounds.
Admission is $20, $15 ages 5 to 12. The Compromise tour, offered
only on Saturday after July 11, involves a Jeep ride to the mine,
then a rail ride into Aspen mountain. Fee: $30 and $20.
Reservations required: (970) 925-2049.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Among Aspen's several luxury hotels, two Victorian red-brick
standouts are on Main Street, the Jerome at 330 East Main, and the
Sardy House at 128 East Main.
 &HT;    Built in 1889, at the height of the silver boom, the Jerome
boasted the first elevator west of the Mississippi. Painstakingly
restored a decade ago, this central Aspen landmark is one of 16
city buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
 &HT;    With a fire in the parlor fireplace, elk heads on walls and
cherry wood throughout, a visitor feels like a silver baron. For a
night in one of its 93 hotel rooms, the Jerome's nightly charges
vary in the summer from $295 to as much as $1,190, for a suite;
(800) 331-7213, fax (970) 925-2784.
 &HT;    Two blocks down Main Street, half-hidden by towering pines,
stands another Victorian gem, Sardy House. This quiet hotel of 20
well-appointed rooms has a small heated swimming pool in the
garden. Summer room rates, including breakfast, vary from $180 to
$440; (970) 920-2525.
 &HT;    For a resortlike setting in town, the Aspen Institute has 98
guest rooms and suites on its 40-acre riverfront campus on the west
end of town. Guests can use the institute's six tennis courts,
gymnasium and outdoor lap pool, and have golf privileges at the
Snowmass Lodge and Club. Summer room rates are $195 to $395; (970)
925-4240.
 &HT;    Budget: The Limelite Lodge at 228 East Cooper Ave., was the
cradle of the 1950's folk group The Limeliters when it was a
nightclub. Now, it is a family-oriented hotel, with 72 rooms, some
with kitchens, starting at $98 in summer; (970) 925-3025.
 &HT;    The Boomerang Lodge at 500 West Hopkins Avenue has 34 sun-filled
units, each with a private balcony or terrace offering a view of
Shadow Mountain. Rooms in summer start at $131, including
Continental breakfast; (970) 925-3416.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Aspen's nearly 100 restaurants have spruced up their summer
menus and honed their service in anticipation of the Food and Wine
Magazine Classic, taking place this weekend. Among them is Pinons,
105 South Mill St., where entrees include sauteed Colorado pheasant
breast and elk tenderloin. Dinner for two, with wine, is about
$120; (970) 920-2021.
 &HT;    The Little Nell, in the hotel of the same name, at 675 East
Durant Ave. is a personal favorite. In the elegant dining room or
sunny courtyard, diners enjoy mustard crusted trout or
honey-soy-seared salmon. Dinner for two with wine is around $150;
Hours: 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.; (970) 920-6330.
 &HT;    Outdoor dining with a view of Aspen Mountain can also be found
down the block, at Ajax Tavern, 685 East Durant. On a terrace near
the ski area's gondola as well in the dining room, diners can eat
local foods like free range chicken and Colorado lamb. Dinner for
two with wine costs about $100. Lunch and dinner served; (970)
920-9333.
 &HT;    A midpriced standout is Campo di Fiori, 205 South Mill St., an
earthy grotto with well-prepared Northern Italian dishes, a strong
Italian wine list and rapid-fire service. Try the arugula salad and
the risotto giardinera (asparagus, tomato, spinach and bell
peppers). Open for dinner daily. Dinner for two with wine costs
about $80; (970) 920-7717.
 &HT;    On the second floor of a bookstore at 221 East Main, Explore
Bistro offers vegetarian meals _ breakfast, lunch and dinner _ on a
sundeck or inside. Dinner for two with a drink is about $40; (970)
925-5338.
 &HT;    La Cocina, 308 East Hopkins Ave., a local hangout with
Southwestern cuisine, draws everyone from ski lift operators to
Hollywood types. Margaritas, blue corn tortillas and chocolate
velvet, a mousselike cake, add up to about $35 for two; (970)
925-9714.
 &HT;    Woody Creek Tavern is a timeless joint held together with
cigarette smoke, country music and old wallpaper five miles out of
town, in Woody Creek. The burger of local Limousin beef goes for
$6.95 and the chicken fajitas are $8.95. No credit cards. Don't ask
for espresso; (970) 923-4585.
 NIGHT LIFE  
 &HT;    After serving surprisingly good cabaret food, the waiters and
waitresses at the Crystal Palace, 300 East Hyman Ave., transform
themselves into a hilarious satirical revue.
 &HT;    During their annual spring break, they undoubtedly wore pencils
to the nub reworking fresh material supplied from our nation's
capital. Dinner and one-hour show are offered Thursday through
Saturday for $49.50 a person. For reservations, call (970)
925-1455.

 &HT;    For a resortlike setting in town, the Aspen Institute has 98
guest rooms and suites on its 40-acre riverfront campus on the west
end of town. Guests can use the institute's six tennis courts,
gymnasium and outdoor lap pool, and have golf privileges at the
Snowmass Lodge and Club. Summer room rates are $195 to $395; (970)
925-4240.
 &HT;    Budget: The Limelite Lodge at 228 East Cooper Ave., was the
cradle of the 1950's folk group The Limeliters when it was a
nightclub. Now, it is a family-oriented hotel, with 72 rooms, some
with kitchens, starting at $98 in summer; (970) 925-3025.
 &HT;    The Boomerang Lodge at 500 West Hopkins Avenue has 34 sun-filled
units, each with a private balcony or terrace offering a view of
Shadow Mountain. Rooms in summer start at $131, including
Continental breakfast; (970) 925-3416.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Aspen's nearly 100 restaurants have spruced up their summer
menus and honed their service in anticipation of the Food and Wine
Magazine Classic, taking place this weekend. Among them is Pinons,
105 South Mill St., where entrees include sauteed Colorado pheasant
breast and elk tenderloin. Dinner for two, with wine, is about
$120; (970) 920-2021.
 &HT;    The Little Nell, in the hotel of the same name, at 675 East
Durant Ave. is a personal favorite. In the elegant dining room or
sunny courtyard, diners enjoy mustard crusted trout or
honey-soy-seared salmon. Dinner for two with wine is around $150;
Hours: 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.; (970) 920-6330.
 &HT;    Outdoor dining with a view of Aspen Mountain can also be found
down the block, at Ajax Tavern, 685 East Durant. On a terrace near
the ski area's gondola as well in the dining room, diners can eat
local foods like free range chicken and Colorado lamb. Dinner for
two with wine costs about $100. Lunch and dinner served; (970)
920-9333.
 &HT;    A midpriced standout is Campo di Fiori, 205 South Mill St., an
earthy grotto with well-prepared Northern Italian dishes, a strong
Italian wine list and rapid-fire service. Try the arugula salad and
the risotto giardinera (asparagus, tomato, spinach and bell
peppers). Open for dinner daily. Dinner for two with wine costs
about $80; (970) 920-7717.
 &HT;    On the second floor of a bookstore at 221 East Main, Explore
Bistro offers vegetarian meals _ breakfast, lunch and dinner _ on a
sundeck or inside. Dinner for two with a drink is about $40; (970)
925-5338.
 &HT;    La Cocina, 308 East Hopkins Ave., a local hangout with
Southwestern cuisine, draws everyone from ski lift operators to
Hollywood types. Margaritas, blue corn tortillas and chocolate
velvet, a mousselike cake, add up to about $35 for two; (970)
925-9714.
 &HT;    Woody Creek Tavern is a timeless joint held together with
cigarette smoke, country music and old wallpaper five miles out of
town, in Woody Creek. The burger of local Limousin beef goes for
$6.95 and the chicken fajitas are $8.95. No credit cards. Don't ask
for espresso; (970) 923-4585.
 NIGHT LIFE  
 &HT;    After serving surprisingly good cabaret food, the waiters and
waitresses at the Crystal Palace, 300 East Hyman Ave., transform
themselves into a hilarious satirical revue.
 &HT;    During their annual spring break, they undoubtedly wore pencils
to the nub reworking fresh material supplied from our nation's
capital. Dinner and one-hour show are offered Thursday through
Saturday for $49.50 a person. For reservations, call (970)
925-1455.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    From the days of Al Capone through the glittery era of Frank
Sinatra, Bob Hope and Dinah Shore, we mature travelers have been
bedazzled by stories of Palm Springs, Calif. But who can afford
that kind of playground except movie stars?
 &HT;    Today, little has changed in classy Palm Springs and its
neighboring communities in the Coachella Valley, which is about 120
miles east of Hollywood in the desert _ little, that is, except the
cost of having a good time.
 &HT;    Play golf for $20 a round on uncrowded courses? Stay at a resort
for $49 a night? Eat at outstanding restaurants and get pampered in
the spas? Find discounts at almost every attraction without waiting
in line?
 &HT;    Yes, it's true.
 &HT;    Indeed, mature travelers who shop around, do their homework and
pick the proper season can experience the joys of Palm Springs for
about $100 a day per person. That season is summer. The downside:
the heat.
 &HT;    No longer does Palm Springs shut down between June and
September, as it used to when resident celebrities fled to cooler
climes. One marketing executive at a local resort explained it this
way: It is less expensive for restaurants, hotels and other travel
vendors to stay open during the summer than to have to lay off
staff as the heat approaches and hire new, green help in the fall.
 &HT;    The result: During the summer, there are restaurants with more
waiters than customers, rooms with good rates and golf tee-times
almost anytime you want.
 &HT;    Many of Palm Springs' bargains, in fact, stay in place through
mid-December.
 BEATING THE HEAT  
 &HT;    We visited Palm Springs and the Coachella Valley for a few days
late last June, when daytime temperatures were already over 100. We
played lots of golf, swam almost every afternoon, enjoyed some fine
naps under misters in the shade, took evening walks and did our
sightseeing _ mostly to air-conditioned places _ in the early
afternoon.
 &HT;    Our formula for enjoying the Palm Springs heat is to plan ahead
and move slowly.
 &HT;    Our early morning tee times meant we were able to enjoy the
benefit of a comforting breeze and, as a bonus, we learned that the
desert is prettiest at the beginning of the day.
 &HT;    If it got too hot for us to finish 18 holes _ at only $15 to $30
a round _ we simply quit the course and cooled down in the
clubhouse.
 &HT;    We started at 7:30 one morning at Del Webb's Sun City Palm
Desert (760-772-2200 for tee times). A few golfers were on the
course ahead of us, but there was never a wait to play. At that
course, visitors pay $80 a round in winter but only about $30 in
summer.
 &HT;    The next day, with a 6:30 a.m. tee-off, we played the
championship course at Marriott's Rancho Las Palmas resort
(760-862-4551). It costs $109 a round in winter, $48 in summer. We
finished 18 holes before noon, beating the heat again.
 &HT;    Several great courses have summer ``twilight'' rates: $20 for 18
holes after 10:30 a.m. at Rancho Las Palmas before the heat or
darkness get to you.
 &HT;    Darkness doesn't blanket Palm Springs until about 7 p.m., which
means golf fanatics can play late into the evening. However, our
original plan to play nine holes in the early morning and another
nine just before dark didn't work. Frankly, it's too hot in the
early evening _ coolness comes to the desert at night.
 &HT;    On getaway day we started to play at about 8 a.m. at Tommy
Jacobs' Bel Air Greens (760-322-6062), an easy nine-hole course
that is almost entirely shaded.
 &HT;    Last June, it cost $15 a round. If we had waited a month,
between July and September, Bel Air would have charged $14 a round
_ and handed out two-for-one passes.
 LODGING DEALS  
 &HT;    This year, summer specials at Palm Spring's hotels may not be as
spectacular as last year due to increased occupancies. (Seems more
people are realizing the benefits of vacationing in the desert!)
But mature travelers can still find spectacle savings if they shop
wisely.
 &HT;    Last June, our $69 room at Marriott's Rancho Las Palmas in
Rancho Mirage (800-909-6019) _ one of the leading resorts _ cost
$179 or more last winter.
 &HT;    One of the best lodging deals we found was a $49-a-night
weeknight summer special at the Palm Springs Spa Hotel &AMP; Casino,
operated by the Cahuilla tribe and located right in downtown Palm
Springs. That price included a room for two, a spa session, dinner
two-fers and $10 in casino chips. January through mid-June, those
rooms cost up to $159 without the extras.
 &HT;    Public transit around the valley is practically useless to
tourists, and most summer visitors rent autos or bring their own.
 &HT;    We spent early afternoons touring in cool places: the
air-conditioned Palm Springs Desert Museum; the well-shaded,
outdoor Living Desert Wildlife Park; and the new Palm Springs Air
Museum. All give senior discounts of up to 50 percent.
 TAKE A TOUR  
 &HT;    Celebrity Tours' (760-770-2700) 2 1/2-hour trips show you where
the stars live and include a pickup in an air-conditioned
motorcoach at your hotel. Mature travelers get $2 off the regular
$17 tour price.
 &HT;    The easiest way to beat the heat is to ride the Palm Springs
Aerial Tramway (760-325-1449) to the top of the 12,000-foot Mount
San Jacinto. Bring a jacket _ it's 30 degrees cooler high above the
desert floor. Mature travelers get $3 off $17 tram tickets.
 &HT;    The Palm Springs Desert Resorts Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau
operates centers in Rancho Mirage and at the Palm Springs Regional
Airport. For more information, call (800) 417-3529, or write 69-930

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For passionate skiers, the season doesn't end when the mountain
bikes come out in Colorado and Utah. Summer is the time to get on a
plane and head south to Chile and Argentina.
 &HT;    North America may be enjoying hot weather, but south of the
border you'll find snow falling in the rugged Andes.
 &HT;    ``Last year was a great year for snow down there,'' explains
Gary Nicoll, manager of Ski Vacation Planners. ``We're hoping for
the same this year.''
 &HT;    The resorts of Chile and Argentina promise challenging runs,
glorious mountain scenery and a laid-back Latin lifestyle. The
resorts usually open in mid-June and close around the first week of
October.
 &HT;    There are daily direct flights from Miami to Santiago and Buenos
Aires. Remember that this is a good time to use frequent-flier
miles for both tickets and upgrades.
 &HT;    The flights may be long _ about eight hours from Miami to
Santiago _ but the good news is that jetlag, the bane of many
European ski vacations, is minimal for North Americans heading
south.
 &HT;    In Chile, the major resorts to consider are Portillo, Valle
Nevado, Termas de Chillan.
 &HT;    Portillo, about 92 miles from Santiago, has spectacular
surroundings, including the 23,000-foot Cerro Aconcagua, the
highest peak in the Americas.
 &HT;    There is plenty of beginner and intermediate terrain here, as
well as enough expert terrain, including chutes, to keep advanced
skiers busy for a week.
 &HT;    Just 37 miles from Santiago is Valle Nevado, a vast resort with
over 40 miles of groomed runs, with all skiing above the treeline.
 &HT;    Skiers can also access two adjacent areas, La Parva and El
Colorado.
 &HT;    Valle Nevado has a village not unlike that at the Canadian
resort of Whistler. The skiing is varied, with plenty of
intermediate and expert terrain.
 &HT;    Termas de Chillan, located about 300 miles south of Santiago,
has emerged as one of the most popular ski resorts in the country.
 &HT;    A hot springs resort that dates back to the 17th century, it has
a vast amounts of terrain, including one run that it is 6.8 miles
long.
 &HT;    In July of 1997, the Gran Hotel Termas de Chillan opened, the
first five-star deluxe hotel at the resort.
 &HT;    Las Lenas, San Carlos de Bariloche and Chapelco are the primary
areas in Argentina.
 &HT;    Las Lenas has some of the most challenging terrain on Earth,
with over 40 miles of trails. It is the choice for expert skiers
and for powder-hounds looking for some of that fabled Andes snow.
 &HT;    San Carlos de Bariloche is the only town in South America with a
traditional ski culture. Picturesquely located on the shores of
Lake Nahuel Huapi, it long ago earned the moniker ``Little
Switzerland.''
 &HT;    The ski mountain, Cerro Catedral, is about 12 miles from town.
There is so much terrain here that both intermediates and advanced
skiers have plenty of opportunity to explore.
 &HT;    Chapelco is located 12 miles outside of the lakeside resort town
of San Martin de Los Andes. It offers tree-skiing and steep chutes
for experts only. The resort is accessed via an air connection from
Bariloche.
 &HT;    High season in Chile and Argentina, which runs from mid-July to
mid-August, is based on South American school holidays and should
be avoided. Both prices and crowds can be nearly double what they
are in low-season.
 &HT;    Mid-August is generally regarded as the best time for North
Americans to go while ``spring'' skiing arrives in early September,
with a season's worth of snowfall and lodging discounts everywhere.
 &HT;    Anyone shopping around for a South American ski vacation should
look to a specialist, such as Ski Vacation Planners (545 Cedar
Lane, Teaneck, N.J. 07666; 800-822-6754) or Adventures on Skis (815
North Road, Westfield, Mass. 01085; 800-628-9655).
 &HT;    Both companies have established reputations in planning such
trips and can easily arrange add-ons in Santiago or Buenos Aires.
 &HT;    Here's a selection of packages. Prices are per person and are
based on double occupancy in mid- to late-August.
 &HT;    Adventures on Skis offers a package to Las Lenas that includes
round-trip airfare between Miami, Buenos Aires and Malargue,
round-trip airport transfers, seven nights' lodging at the Hotel
Escorpio, daily lift tickets, as well as daily breakfast and dinner
for $2,575.
 &HT;    In Chile, they have Termas de Chillan in late August that
includes round-trip airfare from Miami to Santiago and round-trip
airfare from Santiago to Concepcion. Skiers also receive transfers,
seven nights' accommodation at the Grand Hotel Termas de Chillan, a
weekly lift ticket, breakfast and dinner daily. The price starts at
$2,170.
 &HT;    Ski Vacation Planners has a deal to Portillo that starts at
$1,315 for seven nights' accommodation at the Hotel Portillo, four
meals daily, eight full-day lift tickets for $1,315, land only.
Round-trip airfare from Miami to Santiago is $954. Transfers are
extra.
 &HT;    In Argentina, they can offer Bariloche for $1,497, land-only, at
the Club Hotel Catedral, at the base of the mountain. The price
includes seven nights' accommodation, daily breakfast and dinner.
Lift tickets and transfers are extra. Airfare from Miami to Buenos
Aires to Bariloche is $1,321.

 &HT;    For passionate skiers, the season doesn't end when the mountain
bikes come out in Colorado and Utah. Summer is the time to get on a
plane and head south to Chile and Argentina.
 &HT;    North America may be enjoying hot weather, but south of the
border you'll find snow falling in the rugged Andes.
 &HT;    ``Last year was a great year for snow down there,'' explains
Gary Nicoll, manager of Ski Vacation Planners. ``We're hoping for
the same this year.''
 &HT;    The resorts of Chile and Argentina promise challenging runs,
glorious mountain scenery and a laid-back Latin lifestyle. The
resorts usually open in mid-June and close around the first week of
October.
 &HT;    There are daily direct flights from Miami to Santiago and Buenos
Aires. Remember that this is a good time to use frequent-flier
miles for both tickets and upgrades.
 &HT;    The flights may be long _ about eight hours from Miami to
Santiago _ but the good news is that jetlag, the bane of many
European ski vacations, is minimal for North Americans heading
south.
 &HT;    In Chile, the major resorts to consider are Portillo, Valle
Nevado, Termas de Chillan.
 &HT;    Portillo, about 92 miles from Santiago, has spectacular
surroundings, including the 23,000-foot Cerro Aconcagua, the
highest peak in the Americas.
 &HT;    There is plenty of beginner and intermediate terrain here, as
well as enough expert terrain, including chutes, to keep advanced
skiers busy for a week.
 &HT;    Just 37 miles from Santiago is Valle Nevado, a vast resort with
over 40 miles of groomed runs, with all skiing above the treeline.
 &HT;    Skiers can also access two adjacent areas, La Parva and El
Colorado.
 &HT;    Valle Nevado has a village not unlike that at the Canadian
resort of Whistler. The skiing is varied, with plenty of
intermediate and expert terrain.
 &HT;    Termas de Chillan, located about 300 miles south of Santiago,
has emerged as one of the most popular ski resorts in the country.
 &HT;    A hot springs resort that dates back to the 17th century, it has

HELLENIC COLLEGE GETS ACCREDITATION WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two educational bodies that accredit Hellenic College and
Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology have warned the
institution that it could face probation if the Greek Orthodox
Church fails to guarantee its academic autonomy, including freedom
in personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In two pointed letters to the school, the New England
Association of Schools and Colleges and the Association of
Theological Schools expressed serious concern over the way the
Brookline, Mass. school's president and three veteran professors
were fired last year.
</P>
<P>
   The church's national leader allegedly had the four priests
fired because they refused to cover up an incident of alleged
sexual misconduct by a seminarian at the theology school, sources
said. Their firings last July have sparked heated controversy and
calls for the resignation of Archbishop Spyridon, the embattled
leader of the nation's 2 million Greek Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   Both educational associations have given the flagship
educational institution of the Greek Orthodox Church in America
several months to come up with a governing structure that
safeguards it from interference by church authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Hellenic College, a four-year liberal arts college, and Holy
Cross, a seminary that trains Greek Orthodox priests, enrolled a
total of about 180 students last year.
</P>
<P>
   If the school does not come up with a satisfactory plan, the
accrediting associations said they will consider placing it on
probation, the first step toward loss of accreditation. Such a step
would deal a major blow to the school's reputation and could make
it difficult to attract students.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Spyridon, who also holds the title of chairman of the board of
trustees of the school, tried to downplay the seriousness of the
warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased to report that the accreditation will not be
affected in any adverse way by the actions of either body,'' he
said in a press release issued late last month by the Greek
Orthodox Archdiocese of America.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Theological Schools, in a recent letter to
Greek Orthodox Church leaders, said it was formally placing Holy
Cross on ``warning'' until January.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate letter, the New England Association of Schools and
Colleges told church leaders it was delaying action on a motion to
ask the school to ``show cause why it should not be placed on
probation.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England Association delayed taking any punitive action
because church and school leaders showed a strong willingness to
correct problems at the school, the association's letter said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the letter said, ``Failure to effectively respond to
our concerns will lead to an adverse action.''
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon and other archdiocesan officials have repeatedly stated
that the firings at the school had nothing to do with the sexual
misconduct case. They said the personnel decisions were an attempt
to resolve long-running personal feuds among faculty and
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Some Greek Orthodox activists sympathetic to Spyridon say that
many conservative Greek Orthodox fear that Hellenic College has
become too secular and has lost some of its religious and ethnic
identity. They say the archbishop is trying to respond to these
fears.
</P>
<P>
   The school receives funding from and is part of the national
Greek archdiocese. Many Greek-Americans have long hoped that
Hellenic College could break free of its Greek Orthodox ties and
like other institutions with religious and ethnic roots, such as
Notre Dame and Brandeis, evolve into a more secular academic
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon's detractors say that the potential threat to the
accreditation is another example of the archbishop's poor
leadership skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The archdiocese has issued a press release making this look
like a slap on the wrist, but as a college administrator I can tell
you that the actions taken by the accrediting agencies amount to
much more,'' said Thomas Lelon, executive director of Greek
Orthodox American Leaders, a church dissident group, and vice
president and dean of academic affairs at Nichols College in
Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, many American colleges and universities would
overhaul administrations for placing their accreditation in
jeopardy,'' added Lelon, whose group, made up of influential
Greek-Americans, is trying to force Spyridon to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues raised by the accrediting associations were the
difficulty of reconciling the role of church authorities with the
American practice of separating church and state in education, and
the proper role of priests as faculty and administrators, as well
as academic freedom, and faculty rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand we have an institution of higher learning
expected to function more or less like any other institution,''
said Charles Cook, director of the New England Association of
Schools and Colleges. ``On the other hand it's part of a church.
The issue is one of balance and that's what we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Lelon, a former president of Hellenic College, recalled how
difficult it was for the school to obtain its accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``After overcoming all the challenges ... it becomes
professionally embarrassing to have the administration called on
the carpet to defend why probation should not be imposed,'' he
said.

<P>
   Nine days into the journey, W. Hodding Carter finds this
remarkable: He doesn't hate the boat yet.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and his nine-man crew have set sail once again on the
Snorri, a 54-foot wooden replica of a Viking ship, and are
attempting to re-create _ as authentically as possible _ the voyage
of Leif Ericsson.
</P>
<P>
   For Carter, a writer and adventurer from West Virginia and son
of former State Department spokesman Hodding Carter, the smooth
sailing so far has been a pleasure. During last year's maiden
voyage, a rudder broke while the Snorri was crossing the Davis
Strait from Greenland, and the crew was forced to abandon the
expedition. The boat was towed back to Greenland by the Canadian
Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' Carter said. ``I kept fooling myself,
saying we can keep on going. We would have probably died.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carter, who says he has ``a big stubborn streak,'' decided
almost immediately to try again.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and his crew of would-be Norsemen left Nuuk, Greenland,
on June 28 and are en route to L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland _
the one confirmed Norse settlement in North America. The Snorri's
crew hopes to complete the 1,500-mile voyage in less than three
months, crossing the Davis Strait from Greenland to Baffin Island
and then south to Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   The Snorri, which carries crew from across New England, has no
cabin so the men sleep on deck, under tarps. &UR;  &LR; Named for the first
Viking child born in the New World, the Snorri was followed out of
port by a fleet of kayaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day was a very emotional one for me,'' said Carter. ``I
even cried a little. Tough Viking, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   The Snorri crew had a few days of sunny, warm weather to begin
the voyage. But as they sailed north along Greenland's coast, the
rains came. Over the weekend, the crew put ashore in the town of
Maniitsoq to stock up on provisions and dry out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just relentless rain,'' said crew member Doug Cabot of
Somerville by telephone from Greenland. ``After a while, it gets
just a little bit dull, a little bit depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cabot is eager to get on with the journey. He was on bow
watch when the Snorri had a close encounter with a humpback whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We passed within 10 yards of it. It did a big roll out of the
water right next to us ... spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Cabot said the crew is now engaged in ``a little bit of a
waiting game to figure &UR;  &LR; where to make the crossing'' of the Davis
Strait. That decision will be based on weather and ice conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Snorri is powered by a canvas sail and wooden oars. But the
boat is outfitted with some modern navigational aides _ radios, a
compass, and hand-held global positioning system unit, as well as a
laptop computer that can connect the Snorri to the rest of the
world via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The voyage's site on the World Wide Web
(www.beyond.landsend.com) recorded about 180,000 hits in the first
week of this year's voyage. The trip is being underwritten by
Land's End, the Wisconsin mail-order retailer, and Carter plans to
write a book.
</P>
<P>
   During last year's voyage, Carter remembers hating the Snorri,
hating the cold that made him think about chopping his hands off,
and questioning the whole idea of the voyage.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter has fallen back in love with the Maine-built Snorri,
whose rudder, as well as the crew's spirit, has been shored up.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are guys that are trying to pretend to be Vikings,''
Carter said of his crew. ``They don't know what a second thought
is. ... Last year we went into this last summer with our typical
sort of American impatience, and, as a group, we left it with a lot
more patience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Snorri crew has 100 miles behind it and 1,400 ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right on schedule, because we really have no schedule,''
Carter wrote. He said his crew was ``psyched. More positive than
last year even, and happy to be together again. No one has gotten
too stinky yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And, at this point in the journey, Carter still loves his boat.
``I think,'' he said, ``it has something to do with the Viking
clothes.'' &UR;  &LR;

WATCHING A DRUG WORK ITS WONDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Farragher, at 75, has always been vigorous to a fault. He
wants to cut his own grass, shovel his own sidewalk, and trim the
trees he planted years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To the consternation of his large family, he also sometimes
likes to act as his own doctor, applying liniment for aches or
popping off-the-shelf pills for pain, insisting he knows what works
and what doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his generation, Farragher is suspicious of medical
claims about miracle treatments and wonder drugs.
</P>
<P>
   That suspicion dissipated last month.
</P>
<P>
   My father suffered a massive stroke on June 25. But within hours
of receiving a relatively new drug _ a drug that specialists say
could spare thousands of Americans each year from death and
disability _ I watched him move an arm that had been paralyzed and
see from an eye that had been blinded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stroke is the number three killer in this country, and we just
recently developed the first treatment that's been proven effective
for it,'' said Dr. John Marler, a neurologist with the National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enormous potential for reducing the toll of death
and disability, however, only an estimated 5 percent of stroke
patients who might benefit are being treated with the drug, a
genetically-engineered clot-buster called TPA that must be
adminstered within three hours in order to work. One major reason
is the inability of many Americans to recognize the symptoms of
stroke _ dizziness, numbness, headaches, slurred speech, vision
problems or shortness of breath. Another is that many hospitals and
physicians have been slow to offer the treatment, which can cause
devastating harm if given to the wrong type of stroke patient.
</P>
<P>
   TPA, for tissue plasminogen activator, can re-establish blood
flow to the brain and cut the risk of stroke damage. It is widely
used to treat heart attack victims.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; James Farragher, the neurologist said, was the beneficiary not
only of that new treatment, but of meeting the chief criterion for
its use: He got to the hospital soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   My father is a retired mailman who still works part-time at a
market in Clinton, Mass., collecting grocery carts and small-town
gossip in the parking lot. Eleven days ago, after his morning at
work, he was spreading insecticide in the front yard when his
oldest grandchild, 15, noticed him slumped over.
</P>
<P>
   Even to the untrained eye, it was clear he had had a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter flagged down a passing police cruiser, his wife
called 911, and within a half hour, he was in Clinton Hospital's
emergency room, where his treatment began.
</P>
<P>
   As I drove from work down the Mass Pike and up Interstate 495, I
steeled myself for the worst. When I walked up to his hospital bed
I was, briefly, relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Tom,'' he said. ``Did you read about Barnicle's dog
today? Pretty good.'' He was conscious. He recognized me. I had
counted on neither.
</P>
<P>
   But it was &UR;  &LR; quickly &UR;  &LR; obvious that he had been badly damaged. The
left side of his face was frozen. His speech was terribly slurred.
His left arm sat withered by his side and responded to no stimulus.
He could move his left leg, but it was clearly weakened by the
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   He had become one of about 700,000 Americans this year who will
suffer a stroke, the sudden interruption of blood flow in the
brain. One-third of them will die. Only heart disease and cancer
kill more Americans each year.
</P>
<P>
   Eight out of every 10 strokes are caused by a clot in the blood
vessels that halts flow to the brain. That's the kind of stroke my
father had. And it's the kind of stroke that's treatable by TPA,
which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
treatment of strokes in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After a CT scan determined that my father's stroke was caused by
a clot, and not a hemorrhage _ &UR;  &LR; which TPA can worsen with
disastrous results &UR;  &LR; _ the emergency room physician, Dr. Robert
Stine, said he was a candidate for the treatment. There was, we
were told, a 3 percent chance it could hurt him; a 97 percent
chance it would be ineffective or cause improvement.
</P>
<P>
   To be effective, TPA must be given within three hours after the
stroke occurs. My father's, as near as we could tell, had occurred
at about 1:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to get the drug,'' the family told Stine. And
he &UR;  &LR; began receiving the drug at about 4:15 p.m., barely within the
three-hour limit.
</P>
<P>
   As the clot-dissolving drug dripped into his bloodstream at the
same hospital where his nine children were born, the family kept
vigil in the hallway outside.
</P>
<P>
   His primary-care physician arrived with sobering news. The
stroke was massive. Death was a possibility. My mother called a
Catholic priest to administer what used to be called the Last
Rites, and now &UR;  &LR; is known as the Sacrament of the Sick.
</P>
<P>
   I began thinking of my father's future in terms of wheelchair
ramps and nursing homes _ a future far from his vigorous life.
</P>
<P>
   As we gathered around his bed an hour later, the last of the TPA
just entering his system, my father had what the doctors call an
``on-the-table response.'' Without prompting, he suddenly raised
his left arm over his head. His left eye, cloudy all afternoon,
began to brighten. His speech was slightly better. A nurse asked
him to squeeze her hand. And he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians have been really conservative about using TPA,''
said Marler. ``But there is a wonderful opportunity here that just
doesn't exist for other major diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroke specialists say that public understanding is critical if
TPA is to become a more common treatment. Allowing for tests that
must be done after a stroke victim gets to the hospital, patients
must recognize what is happening and call for help within about 90
minutes after symptoms occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your father was lucky that he went to a hospital where the
physician was organized enough to do this,'' said Marler, a federal
stroke researcher. ``What I think is going to make the difference
is when patients begin to ask, `Does my hospital have this
treatment?' And then, of course, they've got to get to the
emergency room rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Hospital, a small community hospital, is affiliated with
the &UR;  &LR; University of Massachusetts Memorial Health Care in nearby
Worcester, Mass., a level-one trauma center. Strokes have been
aggressively treated there for two decades, and physicians from its
emergency department teach doctors around the country how to use
TPA to treat strokes.
</P>
<P>
   James Farragher was only the second person to receive TPA at
Clinton Hospital, and one of only 14 patients in the UMass Memorial
system, which encompasses seven hospitals, to have met the
treatment criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Majaz Moonis, who oversees stroke treatment at the UMass
center, said the drug carries with it an increased risk of
hemorrhage. But patients who get it are 30 percent more likely to
be ultimately free of the effects of stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to increase the public's awareness about this,''
Moonis said. ``We're trying to make people think of a stroke as a
brain attack, just like a heart attack, and not to wait and see,
but to get to the hospital quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   My father, transferred to UMass medical center an hour after he
received TPA, is now in a nearby rehabilitation center, where more
improvement is expected.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen of the 80 hospitals in Massachusetts have recently
committed themselves to establishing stroke teams to provide prompt
stroke diagnosis and treatment. The Massachusetts Hospital
Association said the treatment is available at many others.
</P>
<P>
   A neurologist who treated my father said TPA saved him from
about 80 percent of the effects of the stroke that he otherwise
would have incurred, such as partial paralysis. He remains somewhat
weak, and his speech is a little slurred.
</P>
<P>
   But he can walk and talk and read and eat. And he will go home
to a family that believes in miracles.

Society. The state-of-the-art exhibit tells of Tapping Reeve's
school, which began in his living room and soon moved to its own
building. In doing so, the exhibit illustrates students'
experiences of travel, study, entertainment, and courtship. The
first student was Aaron Burr, Reeve's brother-in-law, and soon
included future leaders of the country, including Vice President
John C. Calhoun, educator Horace Mann, and Supreme Court justices.
The exhibit, Tapping Reeve House, and Law School are all near the
Litchfield Green, one of the most picturesque in New England. For

   Dr. Beach, a.k.a. Stephen P. Leatherman, has once again named
his top beaches. No New England beach makes the top 10, but one,
Coast Guard Beach on Cape Cod, is No. 18. Leatherman, a professor
at Florida International University of Miami, devises the list
based on 50 criteria within categories that include: physical
factors such as sand softness; wave size and current strength;
biological factors such as water color and quality and presence of
pests; and human-use factors and impacts such as lifeguard
protection, visual obstructions, and amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 beaches are: Kailua Beach Park, Hawaii; Kaunaoa,
Hawaii; St. Joseph Peninsula State Park, Florida; Wailea, Hawaii;
Caladesi Island State Park, Florida; Hamoa, Hawaii; Cape Florida
SRA, Florida; Hanalei Beach, Hawaii; Fort Desoto Park, Florida; and
St. George Island State Park, Florida.

   Leatherman now has a book, ``America's Best Beaches,'' that

THE IMPORTANCE OF LOOKING GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm so honored! I'm in the New Yorker's summer fiction issue!
No, no, I didn't write anything. Just open the front cover. You see
the words: POLO RALPH LAUREN, and the photo of the dashing young
man in the adirondack chair. No, no, that's not me _ are you
kidding?
</P>
<P>
   Lift open the flap _ it's one of those ads that spread over
three pages. There we are! How generous it was of Mr. Lauren to
invite me to join the photo session. Run your eyes over the family
portrait in front of the beach house. Such a beautiful crew: women
of full lips and full bosom, men of broad forehead and narrow eyes
_ all with finely chiseled features, rich tans, confident smiles,
teeth as blond as the hair. Everyone is so at ease, so casual yet
sophisticated: white summer suits and ties, and no socks anywhere
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Do you see me? I'm not exactly male model material, especially
for a Polo ad. It must have something to do with my monster
schnozzle and too-thick glasses, receding hairline, and porky legs.
And I do have this old-fashioned penchant for wearing socks with my
shoes. But there I am _ the one with the underconfident half-smile.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I do stand out. And for that reason I commend Mr. Lauren
for including me. It is my curse to bear a most unpreppy look. But
does that mean I can't wear Polo clothes? Does that mean I can't
spend lots of money on Mr. Lauren's designs? Lauren is no dummy. He
knows I too can wear his clothes and look, well, just fine. And so
there I am.
</P>
<P>
   In no short time I felt just like one of the Polo family. I felt
and looked beautiful, and feeling and looking beautiful, I
therefore was beautiful, inside and out, untouched by the travails
of life. Just like the family. Look into those perfect faces. Can
anyone who looks like that have a care in the world? Of course not.
When you're pretty your troubles can only be small and easily
brushed under the rug.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, see the schoolboy with the tousled hair, v-neck
sweater, navy blazer, white trousers, and loosely knotted tie. He's
under house arrest. He shot six classmates at his exclusive private
school. But feast your eyes on him _ he looks great!
</P>
<P>
   See the dapper fellow seated cross-legged on the porch with the
adorable little girl riding on his shoulders. A fetching portrait
of father and daughter. He's so handsome in his khaki suit and
white turtle neck, and she's so cute in her navy dress with gold
stripes. You'd never suspect that daddy kidnapped his baby girl
years ago. Poor little thing has no idea what her mother looks
like. But what's the big deal? No kidnapper ever looked so grand!
</P>
<P>
   See the dad and son in front of the house, both sinking their
toes into the grass, white pant cuffs rolled above the ankles. The
son is draping an arm over dad's shoulder; dad is clutching a small
black-and-white-faced dog. When the ancestral beauty has been
passed down along the generations so flawlessly, who cares that the
son has just smashed up the Jag while high on PCP.
</P>
<P>
   I know what that dear fellow Ralph Lauren meant for me to learn.
Join the Polo family _ buy a shirt, some trousers, whatever _ and
my every hardship will crumble into dust. He wanted me to feel it,
and to tell you: All that really matters is to look great _ and to
look like them.

HOFFMAN SHINES IN `WAG'; `AMISTAD' TOO SPIELBERG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``Wag the Dog''  &LR; _ Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as
a producer charged with creating a fictional war to deflect
criticism of the president. His thinly disguised impersonation of
Robert Evans is as juicy as it gets. During some other historical
period the idea would seem preposterous, but not now. Robert De
Niro, in his best role in years, keeps this over-the-top comedy
from sailing off.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Amistad'' &LR;  _ Leave it to Steven Spielberg to make a movie
about slavery where the sun always seems to shine. He even turns a
sequence where slaves are drowning into an underwater ballet. And
it's all done to an excessive John Williams score. Where's the
agonizing pain? Sorry, that might hurt the box office.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The Voyage of La Amistad'' &LR;  _ Narrated by Alfre Woodard, the
documentary is historically accurate and, ultimately, much more
horrifying than Spielberg's fictionalized version. Using drawings
and documents of the period, the filmmakers create a remarkable
portrait.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The Replacement Killers'' &LR;  _ Chow Yun-Fat makes his American
debut with Mira Sorvino in an action drama where bullets speak
louder than words. Not half as good as John Woo's ``The Killer.''

REOPENED: THE MOXLEY MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, CONN. _ Belle Haven is a luxurious spread of green, a
secret garden for very wealthy families who live and die behind its
flower-draped gates.
</P>
<P>
   It was where Martha Moxley lived for a short while, many years
ago. People who cannot forget the golden-haired girl say they
sometimes still imagine her ducking around the tall pines, thick
with needles that hush any noise that might penetrate the borders
of the enclave.
</P>
<P>
   Now, loud voices are breaking through old barriers of money and
power, and the whispers that have persisted for decades about who
killed Martha Moxley on Halloween eve, 1975, when she was 15 years
old, finally will be heard by a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three years after Moxley was clubbed to death with a six
iron in what forensic specialists say was a sexually psychotic
rage, a state attorney will present new evidence to a single grand
juror appointed last month.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the homicide investigation was tainted by
suspicions about cash and clout, and shadowed by a connection to
the Kennedy family. The boys next door, it turned out, were Michael
and Thomas Skakel, the nephews of Ethel Kennedy, widow of Senator
Robert F. Kennedy. And the golf club, a rare Toney Penna model, was
traced to the Skakel home, where the only set in town had been
owned by the boys' mother, who had died two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   New evidence _ and dramatic changes in their alibis _ have
raised fresh questions about the Skakel brothers, and the new
investigation seems certain to focus on them.
</P>
<P>
   The case has attracted a determined band of celebrity conspiracy
unravelers _ from writer Dominick Dunne to O.J. Simpson detective
Mark Fuhrman _ who want to know: Were the Skakels shielded from
blame because of their wealth? Or have they suffered unwarranted
scrutiny simply because of their connection to the Kennedys?
</P>
<P>
   These days, people in Greenwich are wondering whether the wall
of silence around the Skakels will come tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a case that just doesn't go away,'' said Warren Cassell,
owner of Just Books, a Greenwich store that has sold 500 copies of
``Greentown'' by local journalist Timothy Dumas, and has ordered
dozens of copies of Fuhrman's ``Murder in Greenwich,'' which was
released in April.
</P>
<P>
   Both books offer accounts of the Moxley killing that point to
the Skakels as prime suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about it all the time,'' Cassell said. ``Everybody
knows somebody who knows something about it. There is so much
controversy, about the police being so inept, and about how the
Skakels had so much muscle in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Younger Skakel scrutinized
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Skakel, who was 17 at the time of the murder, was
reportedly the last person to see Moxley alive. Friends told police
they saw him and Moxley flirting, engaged in horseplay on the lawn.
The two were left alone that night, as other teens drifted for
home.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Thomas Skakel, who police say was known for violent
outbursts, was named as a chief suspect by frustrated
investigators. Thomas Skakel is the boy Moxley mentions in her
diary as having a crush on her, according to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the younger Skakel, 15-year-old brother Michael, the
young girl wrote, who frightened her a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Now Michael Skakel, who worked as a driver for his late cousin
Michael Kennedy and testified in last summer's investigation into
Kennedy's relationship with a teenage babysitter, stands at the
center of the Greenwich case.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the investigation told the Globe that Michael,
who originally claimed to have spent the evening at the home of a
relative, now says that he climbed a tree outside Moxley's home and
masturbated. The new alibi was told to a private investigator hired
by the family in 1991, but prosecutors have obtained copies of the
investigator's report, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The revised alibi is described in Fuhrman's book, and has fueled
speculation among investigators that Michael changed his story
because he believes new DNA tests could link him to the crime
through semen.
</P>
<P>
   The report states that Thomas Skakel also has changed his
statement, the source told the Globe, saying that he now recalls
leaving his house late at night to meet Moxley in his backyard.
Thomas originally told police that he never saw Moxley again after
he left her around 9:30 p.m. to complete a homework assignment on
Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   That account raised eyebrows from the start: Thomas had been
seen drinking at a restaurant that night, and he had not been given
any assignment about Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Initial police work, however, was shockingly sloppy, so
amateurish that some forensic specialists believed the damage to
the case was irreparable. But Connecticut officials declared this
month they have new evidence that could justify an indictment, and
that they subjected old evidence to new DNA testing methods.
Connecticut Superior Court Justice George Thim, the lone grand
juror, will reexamine the case and decide whether to issue an
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel was unavailable for comment at his Cohasset,
Mass. home, where a small wooden sign posted on the lawn reads,
simply, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael, now 38, is distraught over new developments in the
case, according to friends. In the past, he has attended several
private institutions for people coping with addictions and
emotional problems, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  New York attorney Thomas Sheridan Jr., who commissioned the
private investigator's report for the Skakel family, said last week
that he no longer represents Michael Skakel. During the years that
he did represent Skakel, Sheridan repeatedly told reporters he had
never seen any evidence that connected his client to the Moxley
homicide. Last week, he would neither confirm nor deny that either
Skakel had changed his initial statement.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut attorney Emanuel Margolis, who represents Thomas
Skakel, said last week that he found it ``grievous'' that law
enforcement officials had, in years past, floated his client's name
in connection with the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas took two lie-detector tests. After an initial
inconclusive result, when he was too emotionally drained to provide
an accurate reading, he passed a second test, police say.

 GREENWHICH, Conn.: ... police say.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Skakel, however, was not questioned by Greenwich police
_ a fact that still rankles in town, partly because he was a
reputed troublemaker: Neighbors told police that Michael had killed
small animals, such as chipmunks, with a golf club in his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Most of the people in Greenwich were appalled that the
Skakels were never interviewed,'' said Doris Benedick, a town
librarian and Greenwich native. ``You can only do that if you have
money. Everybody knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Stephen Carroll, a former Greenwich police detective,
acknowledges being embarrassed by the initial investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel so inept,'' said Carroll, recalling that his fellow
detectives had never worked a homicide prior to the Moxley case.
``You feel like a real jerk. You learn more about what should have
been done, and you think, `Why didn't I know that?'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Father initially cooperative
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Skakels were among Greenwich's most prominent families,
heirs to Great Lakes Carbon, once one of the largest privately held
companies in the country. Rushton Skakel, Ethel Kennedy's older
brother, inherited the family business in 1955. He and his wife had
seven children, six sons and a daughter, most of whom carried the
same reputation for wild antics as their Kennedy cousins _ but with
an even rougher edge.
</P>
<P>
   In the first frenzied days after Moxley's body was discovered
under a tree in her front lawn, Rushton Skakel opened his door to
police, Carroll said. But when detectives arrived at the private
school the Skakel boys attended, armed with information that both
boys were emotionally troubled, the family stopped cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll helped Fuhrman and Dumas with their books, he said,
because he is determined to help bring some answers to Moxley's
mother, Dorthy, and brother, John. Moxley's father, John Sr., died
in 1988 from a heart attack. His widow says he was consumed with
his daughter's homicide, telling friends early on that he believed
the local police had lost control of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman, the swashbuckling former Los Angeles police detective
infamous for his racial slurs revealed during the Simpson trial,
tells readers that he has seen the document in which the Skakels
spell out their new alibis.
</P>
<P>
   It was given to Fuhrman by Dunne, who wrote a fictional account
of Moxley's killing, ``A Season in Purgatory,'' and whose own
daughter died from a Halloween eve attack seven years after Moxley
was killed. The report, according to the two authors, was leaked to
Dunne by a private investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dunne and Fuhrman are passionately devoted to making
wealthy people pay for their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there two systems of justice in this country _ one for the
rich and another for the rest of us?'' Fuhrman asks in his book.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that anyone was paid, or received favors,
to keep the Moxley case from being solved, but the feeling persists
in Greenwich that a coverup existed.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Browne, a retired state's attorney, was expected to
prosecute the case, but stepped aside after it was alleged by
Carroll, and reported in ``Greentown,'' that he was reluctant to
prosecute a Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money has always talked in this town,'' said Greenwich
resident Ronny Pucci, sitting on a bench outside the Holly Hill
Deli last week. ``If one of the rich kids got in trouble, you would
never hear about it. But if one of our kids got into trouble, you'd
be reading about it on the front page.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Early probe badly botched
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The worst mistakes in the case were in the initial stages of the
investigation. The Connecticut chief medical examiner did not visit
the crime scene, and Moxley's body was removed by a local funeral
director. Without a properly processed crime scene, it became
difficult to determine how long Moxley had been dead.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, several people, including Michael Skakel, were not
considered suspects because they could account for the time police
believed Moxley was killed, an estimate based solely on when
neighbors remember hearing their dogs bark.
</P>
<P>
   One of those dogs licked blood evidence from the grass while
police fanned out in a haphazard manner to interview witnesses,
Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The killer did not plan the homicide, investigators believe,
but struck Moxley with the club in a flash of anger, then
brutalized her body in a way that indicated a sexually motivated
rage. Moxley's blue jeans and underwear were below her knees when
her body was discovered, but it has not been determined if she was
sexually assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The killer struck Moxley's skull repeatedly, and stabbed her
neck with the jagged shaft of the club after it splintered from the
force of the blows.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley was left in a pool of blood near the end of her driveway.
Later, the trail of evidence made clear, she was dragged to another
spot on the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The night she was killed, Moxley wore faded Tretorn sneakers and
a puka-shell necklace. She spent her last summer carefree,
discovering hiding places with her girlfriends, and savoring the
realization that all the boys liked her because she was pretty and
smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have these notes we would pass back and forth, and her
mother gave me her puka necklace,'' said Christy Kalan, one of
Moxley's closest friends, whose family still lives in Greenwich.
``We used to make those collages, you know, where you cut things
out of magazines and paste them all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalan said many people in Belle Haven wanted the furor of the
Moxley murder to die down, the gruesome details to fade away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's messy, and it's not nice, and it just tarnishes their
world, I think,'' said Kalan. ``It's disruptive to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Moxley's mother, who now lives in New Jersey, said she finds it
cathartic to talk about the young daughter who had just discovered
basketball and boys, the girl who liked to draw, and spent time
talking to her cats as she cradled them in her arms.
</P>
<P>
   She reads the books about her daughter's death, but skims over
descriptions of the blood and Martha's mutilated skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sure I know today who killed her,'' said Dorthy
Moxley. ``I just know it had to be someone who was at their (the
Skakels') house that night. And now I know the boys changed their
stories. Of course, later we found out they had all these emotional
problems. And they haven't cooperated with us. The more you
learn....''
</P>
<P>
   Dorthy Moxley waits each day, hoping that a killer will confess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live for that,'' she said. ``It is what I want. I understand
I still have a long way to go.''

<P>
   Court-ordered desegregation came to Boston _ with ensuing
violence _ in 1974 after the federal judiciary ruled that the
school system was under official racial segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, after relative calm replaced the intense
and often bitter racial turmoil that nearly engulfed Boston, a new
student assignment plan to replace the court-ordered desgregation
plan and its massive busing of students was approved in 1989 by
then-Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, the School Committee and the
state education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, called ``controlled choice,'' was designed by Harvard
University sociology professor Charles Willie and Michael Alves, a
desegregation planner at Brown University. It proved to be a
positive alternative to the court-ordered plan because it gave
parents a wider choice of schools for their children, and it
virtually eliminated ``forced busing'' of students to assigned
schools under the court order.
</P>
<P>
   And the new plan kept the school system from relapsing into
segregation which, as Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. warned, would
have prompted the return of federal court control over the schools.
Yet, nine years later, Schools Superintendent Thomas Payzant and
other officals are considering replacing a proven school assignment
plan with one of three alternatives that are so flawed that, as
Willie and Alves point out, they could return Boston to the
terrible days of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   One option that Payzant is considering is the cluster plan that
would limite parents' choices of elementary and middle schools but
would ensure that students can attend schools closer to their
homes. A second option called a circle plan would allow parents to
choose from 10 schools nearest their homes.
</P>
<P>
   As Alves noted, these two plans would limit parental choice to a
handful of schools within mostly residentially segregated sections
of the city. The plans also give no assurance that the schools
within those contained areas would be of good quality or would
provide enough seating. Willie and Alves view both plans as
virtually guaranteeing a return to the segregated school days that
brought in busing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Another plan that Payzant is considering involves assigning
students to schools without regard to race. Students would be
assigned to schools by choice or by lottery. Under this plan, the
city would retain its system of three large zones, with parents
allowed to pick schools in any of the zones. Students also would
have a priority of attending a school in their immediate
neighborhood over students who want to be transported from other
parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   As Alves points out, this plan appears similar to the notorious
``freedom of choice'' and ``open enrollment'' plans that in reality
were schemes to keep the school system segregated, as many school
officials and parents preferred. ``These plans largely gave
African-American parents false choices, since they had no
reasonable expectation of getting their child admitted to a school
in a predominantly white neighborhood,'' Alves said. This was among
the reasons why the US Supreme Court in 1986 rejected these plans.
</P>
<P>
   What appears to be fueling these alternatives to the current
school assignment plan are deliberately raised false perceptions
that Boston is still under some some form of court-ordered
desegregation that continues to require ``forced busing.''
</P>
<P>
   Such perceptions are not only misleading, but dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Anyone familiar with the original ``controlled choice'' plan
and the three plans currently being floated must wonder what the
real motivation is behind these efforts. All three could bring
racial segregation back to Boston's schools and, as proven by the
courts, could damage the futures of thousands of children.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The fact is, despite some remarks to the contrary, the
current ``controlled choice'' student assignment plan in Boston
already achieves what Payzant and others suggest is what the three
alternative plans could achieve.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As Willie explained, a 1994 study of the ``controlled choice''
plan in Boston, commissioned by the mayor office and the Private
Industry Council provided the following data: 80 percent of
Boston's parents are satisfied with the student assignment process;
72 percent do not wish to have their children mandatorily assigned
to neighborhood schools; 55 percent of the parents choose schools
for educational reasons; and only 20 percent choose schools because
of their location.
</P>
<P>
   Also, 90 percent of students who currently wish to attend
neighborhood schools are accommodated in such schools.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the much-publicized perception that forced busing still
exists, the controlled choice plan actually has all but eliminated
it. In its place is a transportation system that takes students but
largely to schools of their choice. When a critic of the current
plan says a new plan will ``end busing,'' the only busing that will
be ended will be the transportation that students need to take to
go to the school of theirs, and their parents', choice. That would
be akin to ``ending busing'' for students attending the prestigious
Boston Latin school who need it to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Boston considers replacing ``controlled
choice,'' more than a dozen cities across the United States are
still embracing the plan because it brings two important
ingredients _ equality and diversity _ to the school systems. As
for eliminating ``race'' considerations, the controlled choice plan
has already reached that goal. Controlled choice is based on
parental choice, not racial choice.
</P>
<P>
   While some critics of controlled choice argue that a new plan is
needed to improve the quality of the city's schools, controlled
choice has a built-in process for that to happen. Some 30 schools
under the current plan are overenrolled each year, reflecting the
fact that parents know a quality school when they see one. All the
city has to do is to replicate these schools, and the overall
quality of the school system will be vastly improved.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than return to a school system that fits the needs of
some politicians who want to declare a victory over an illusory
``forced busing'' program, the school hierachy ought to maintain
the plan that already fits the educational needs of the city's
children. And that plan is ``controlled choice.''

NOW, DOUBT CAST ON THE LINDA TRIPP `TALKING POINTS' 
</HEADLINE>

 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Steven Brill now has company.
</P>
<P>
   To last month's examination of the press's uncritical handling
of suspect material in the initial stages of Kenneth Starr's Monica
Lewinsky investigation, the names of Skip Fox and John F.X. Gillis
now need to be added as the de-constructors of one of the case's
most important, purported pieces of ``evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be the infamous ``talking points'' that Lewinsky's
manipulative, self-inflating friend, Linda Tripp, claims the former
White House intern gave her during a car ride home last Jan. 14,
and which Tripp claims to have then immediately passed on to the
independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   To that official version, thanks to Fox and Gillis, one question
now cries out for an answer and an investigiation: what talking
points?
</P>
<P>
   Fox is an English professor at the University of Southwestern
Louisiana, and Gillis is a doctoral candidate assistant. In a
serious of three, astonishingly detailed analyses available via the
Internet, they have dealt seriously with some important information
that the Scandalrama Press, competing mindlessly for anti-Clinton
morcels, has essentially ignored. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   _There are significantly different versions of these so-called
talking points, depending on which media outlet claiming possession
of them (they find at least seven) one happens to study.
</P>
<P>
   The best example is a single sentence of recommended Tripp-talk:
``You have never observed the president behaving inappropriately
with anybody.'' It is missing from two outlets' copies but is
present in five others. In addition, one version from US News's
on-line text uses paragraphs completely out of the order in which
they appear in the other versions.
</P>
<P>
   _The differences, not explainable as either typographical or
transcription error, undermine (to put it mildly) any assertion
that there was a simple transmission of a single version of a
document as an attempted subornation of perjury from Lewinsky to
Tripp and then to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   And in their textual analysis, Fox and Gillis don't just note
the widely observed changes in style and content _ from lawyer-like
to quasi-political strategy in preparation for deposition by Paula
Jones to personal asides to second- and first-person versions of
affidavit drafts. They also make a case for multiple authorship,
including by Tripp herself.
</P>
<P>
   _The content of the various versions of the talking points does
not support an assertion that Lewinsky was trying to get Tripp to
``lie'' about what she saw and heard from Kathleen Willey, the
woman who has claimed with diminishing credibility that President
Clinton virtually assaulted her four years ago. Instead, it
supports a skeptical view of Willey that Tripp has always asserted
in public comments and contains ``beliefs'' that by definition
cannot be perjurious.
</P>
<P>
   _The published versions of the material contain information that
available evidence indicates Lewinsky or even the White House could
not have known, above all that Tripp had been dealing with Paula
Jones's attorneys virtually from the moment of her subpoena in that
case on Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The best example here is an almost offhand observation in the
text, obviously for the benefit of Jones's lawyers: ``By the way,
remember how I said there was someone else that I knew about. Well
she turned out to be a huge liar ...'' The authors note that for
Lewinsky to have tried to put those words in Tripp's mouth she
would have to know that Tripp was dealing with them, for which
there is no known evidence. However, they do note that the
adjective ``huge'' is a Tripp favorite in previously published
audiotape transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   _In that one instance, a casual insertion of a gratuitous
comment more than suggests that instead of being a single document,
the talking points are more plausibly an e-mail compilation that
may have existed on more than one computer. That is especially
valid, given the comment's final, throwaway line, ``Well, at least
that gets me out of another scandal I know about.'' And from more
than one computer, more than one source could have given the
differing versions of the document to different media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   _It's also at least interesting that the only reference to
Tripp's first attorney is with his first name, Kirby (Behr), while
Clinton attorney Bob Bennett is mentioned by surname.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief reference to the Fox-Gillis work in this
week's Village Voice and, more important, a Web site
(www.ucs.usl.edu/jfg0701/essays/tripp.html).
</P>
<P>
   There are three documents there, and the reading is heavy. But
it's worth it, as well as truly disturbing about the handling in
the press of ``evidence'' that is very clearly not what it seems or
has been purported to represent. So what else is new?

<TEXT>
<P>
   On matters of unwanted sexual advances between men and women in
the workplace, you may think it is impossible to stretch America's
law any further.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has already ruled, just last week, that
employees need not have suffered any disadvantage in their job to
bring a lawsuit for harassment. They also ruled (in a case
involving lifeguards in Boca Raton, Fla.) that employers are to
blame, even when they are miles away, for failing to prevent
harassment among the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the harassment itself remains in the eye of the
beholder.
</P>
<P>
   A case was recently appealed as far as the Supreme Court in
which a teenage building worker (poor dear) has sued for being
mocked by his colleagues because he wore an earring.
</P>
<P>
   Where will it end? Why, with the case of Smith v United States
of 2021, in which, by a 7-2 majority (Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas dissenting), the court decided that Bobbi Mae Smith had been
sexually harassed not only by her employer, but by society at large
and its agents.
</P>
<P>
   Her employers, MCP Enterprises of Passaic, N.J., had taken every
precaution. Each passage in the building was at least eight feet
wide, and each corner was fitted with warning lights, to prevent
employees bumping into each other.
</P>
<P>
   In order to avoid unwanted sexual banter at the water cooler,
water and coffee were piped to each desk. Rubber plants (those
provocative stalks, those succulent leaves!) were outlawed. The use
of sexually suggestive equipment, such as paper clips or hole
punchers, was frowned upon.
</P>
<P>
   And just to be sure of removing any whiff of sexual
incorrectness, Miss Smith communicated with her boss only by
e-mail, using a program designed to crash at the least indication
of a rise in body temperature at either end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   On the day in question, however, her boss summoned her to his
office. Here, he proceeded to behave improperly. He was seated at
his desk, somewhat closer than the four meters laid down by the
court in Bumpkin v Ferguson (1999).
</P>
<P>
   His hands were not plainly visible (Asphaltic Surfacing v
Simper, 2001), and the blind was drawn, indicating that sexual
congress was in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He then requested her to ``Take a letter, Miss Smith.'' The word
``take,'' of course, was a sexual imperative, implying the
dominance of the male and the submission of the female.
</P>
<P>
   ``A letter'' could be construed to mean a French letter, or a
letter beginning any one of the 15,863 words in English that are
capable of sexual interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss'' implied fixation on the marital status of the
plaintiff, even mockery of same.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Smith was so stunned that she remembered nothing of the
rest of the interview, save reminding herself over and over that
she must call her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Some eyebrows were raised when the plaintiff decided to sue the
federal government, rather than her employer. But Justice Hillary
Clinton, writing for the majority, said this was quite justified.
</P>
<P>
   Extending the principle laid down in Faragher v City of Boca
Raton (1998), if employers could be held liable for failing to
provide an environment, stretching from City Hall to the sea, in
which employees were not harassed, so too (when you think about it)
could society as a whole _ and its political representatives.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   On matters of unwanted sexual advances between men and women in
the workplace, you may think it is impossible to stretch America's
law any further.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has already ruled, just last week, that
employees need not have suffered any disadvantage in their job to
bring a lawsuit for harassment. They also ruled (in a case
involving lifeguards in Boca Raton, Fla.) that employers are to
blame, even when they are miles away, for failing to prevent
harassment among the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the harassment itself remains in the eye of the
beholder.
</P>
<P>
   A case was recently appealed as far as the Supreme Court in
which a teenage building worker (poor dear) has sued for being
mocked by his colleagues because he wore an earring.
</P>
<P>
   Where will it end? Why, with the case of Smith v United States
of 2021, in which, by a 7-2 majority (Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas dissenting), the court decided that Bobbi Mae Smith had been
sexually harassed not only by her employer, but by society at large
and its agents.
</P>
<P>
   Her employers, MCP Enterprises of Passaic, N.J., had taken every
precaution. Each passage in the building was at least eight feet
wide, and each corner was fitted with warning lights, to prevent
employees bumping into each other.
</P>
<P>
   In order to avoid unwanted sexual banter at the water cooler,
water and coffee were piped to each desk. Rubber plants (those
provocative stalks, those succulent leaves!) were outlawed. The use
of sexually suggestive equipment, such as paper clips or hole
punchers, was frowned upon.
</P>
<P>
   And just to be sure of removing any whiff of sexual
incorrectness, Miss Smith communicated with her boss only by
e-mail, using a program designed to crash at the least indication
of a rise in body temperature at either end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   On the day in question, however, her boss summoned her to his
office. Here, he proceeded to behave improperly. He was seated at
his desk, somewhat closer than the four meters laid down by the
court in Bumpkin v Ferguson (1999).
</P>
<P>
   His hands were not plainly visible (Asphaltic Surfacing v
Simper, 2001), and the blind was drawn, indicating that sexual
congress was in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He then requested her to ``Take a letter, Miss Smith.'' The word
``take,'' of course, was a sexual imperative, implying the
dominance of the male and the submission of the female.
</P>
<P>
   ``A letter'' could be construed to mean a French letter, or a
letter beginning any one of the 15,863 words in English that are
capable of sexual interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss'' implied fixation on the marital status of the
plaintiff, even mockery of same.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Smith was so stunned that she remembered nothing of the
rest of the interview, save reminding herself over and over that
she must call her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Some eyebrows were raised when the plaintiff decided to sue the
federal government, rather than her employer. But Justice Hillary
Clinton, writing for the majority, said this was quite justified.
</P>
<P>
   Extending the principle laid down in Faragher v City of Boca
Raton (1998), if employers could be held liable for failing to
provide an environment, stretching from City Hall to the sea, in
which employees were not harassed, so too (when you think about it)
could society as a whole _ and its political representatives.
</P>
<P>
   As long as America remained a nation of roving eyes, wandering
hands, whistling manual laborers and sexually provocative
advertising, the government remained liable to a claim of sexual
harassment from any woman, or man, in the land. That's progress. &QL;

   HELENA, ARK. _ The month of June saw the governor of Arkansas,
Mike Huckabee, announcing that he was going to the Arkansas half of
the Mississippi Delta, to sort out how to make the region grow.
Later in the month, the trip was postponed without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Huckabee is not the first politician to get cold feet about the
Delta and, alas, he will not be the last.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta, which covers parts of Mississippi, Arkansas and
Louisiana, is one of the poorest regions in the United States. The
area has had high, even extreme, rates of poverty for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Median household income there is $16,583; in the country at
large it is $30,056. In the Arkansas Delta alone, where 61 percent
of the state's population lives, unemployment is twice as high as
the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Five percent of the houses have no running water. In Mississippi
County, 35 percent of children live in poverty and 40 percent of
residents lack a high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips County, on the edge of the Mississippi River, ranks
among the worst in the nation in life expectancy for men and women.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that the land is poor. The flat, rich fields are
perfect for growing cotton, and towns here once prospered on the
back of it.
</P>
<P>
   Helena, Ark., is typical. Helena was the home of seven Civil War
Confederate generals. The international King Biscuit Blues Festival
still takes place here.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of people from France, Ireland, Germany, Italy,
Switzerland, China and Lebanon migrated to the area before World
War II to make new lives in farming and the retail trade.
</P>
<P>
   All that began to crumble on Oct. 2, 1944, the day of the first
public demonstration of mechanical cotton-picking in Clarksdale,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Machine-picked cotton cost plantation owners $5.26 a bale; a
handpicked bale cost $39.41. Each machine performed the work of 50
field hands. It was no contest.
</P>
<P>
   By 1965, 95 percent of America's cotton was harvested by
machine. The revolution is still painfully visible in Helena.
There, shacks sit beside rusted cotton gins on the outskirts of
town, and once-grand mansions are slowly falling down.
</P>
<P>
   The region was not left completely without resources. Cotton and
soybeans still grew, and there was still a lumber trade. Clothes
and furniture were manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   But, with one or two notable exceptions, local officials could
not be persuaded to lure new industry in; they were still convinced
that cotton would survive as the kingpin of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the manufacturing sector declined by almost half;
few new manufacturing jobs were found to replace the old. Most
young people now leave the region for larger cities and better
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Segregation, too, has left its mark. Poverty and unemployment
rates are particularly high among blacks, who make up 34 percent of
the Delta's population.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Enterprise Development Corporation (EDC) in
Jackson, Miss., a study once showed that the Delta was like a
doughnut, with rich white farmers making up the outer ring and poor
blacks making up the hole.
</P>
<P>
   The long tradition of giving blacks no proper opportunities, to
get either education or proper jobs, continues to divide the region
along lines of race.
</P>
<P>
   When the gambling industry came to the Delta in 1992, setting up
nine casinos in dirt-poor Tunica, Miss., there were great hopes of
a regional revival. These have proved false. More than half the
population of the town of Tunica itself still lives below the
poverty line, and unemployment there is 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   People also continue to leave; over the past ten years, the
population has fallen by 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the gambling industry has not spread either to the
northern parts of Mississippi or across the river to Arkansas,
where some small Delta towns are simply disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   What can help the Delta to rise again? Cotton's shrinking
acreage will not make a comeback. Many plantations have given way
to catfish farms, but these too are past their glory days.
</P>
<P>
   According to the EDC, local small businesses have trouble
getting loans or financing because this is, historically, an
agricultural region; banks will lend money if there is land as
collateral, but are reluctant if there is no land involved.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses need some incentive both to locate in the Delta, and
to stay there. Tax incentives apart, they need to be sure they can
get the work force they need.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the Arkansas Mid-Delta Work Force Alliance, a
nonprofit initiative funded by the Foundation for the Mid-South,
has been working to improve the local economy, train the local work
force and find jobs for the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   It has had some success in getting people into low-skill,
minimum-wage jobs, but has a long way to go before it makes a mark
on the region.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is also a possibility. The Delta may be as flat as a
pancake, but its musical history is as rich as the soil itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, attempted
to turn Helena into a bright tourist attraction by creating the
Delta Cultural Center to promote the region's rich blues tradition.
The Center now draws in up to 19,000 visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Huckabee sees a similar answer for the future: tourists
mixing with business leaders. Like governors before him, he says he
has hope for the region. But many other minds need to be persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people still believe, as one Arkansas economist put it,
that the best thing that could happen to the Delta would be if
everyone just moved away and left it.
</P>
<P>
   Before any inroads can be made with community reinvestment and
new initiatives, a great many parties both public and private _
nonprofit organizations, banks, state and federal officials _ must
decide that they believe the place has a future. &QL;

<P>
   BENNINGTON, VT. _ Consider the egg: nutritious, inexpensive,
compact, attractively packaged, indispensable in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, according to recently repeated warnings from the
Centers for Disease Control, the Department of Agriculture and even
the egg industry itself, eating eggs in a less than hard-boiled
state may make you ill or even kill you.
</P>
<P>
   Farewell, mayonnaise and hollandaise; farewell, toast soldiers!
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1980s, chicken eggs that were unblemished and
uncracked were widely considered sterile. Now a particular serotype
of Salmonella enteritidis has managed to infect the ovaries of some
hens, and so their eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking kills the bug, but recipes that use raw or lightly
cooked eggs can cause a diarrheal disease which, in serious cases,
can leave victims with arthritis, colon perforations or other
complications.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it leads to death.
</P>
<P>
   Britain was alerted to the problem by the Salmonella outbreaks
between 1982 and 1987. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) saw a
comparable increase in American cases around the same time, and
wondered aloud in medical journals in 1990 if they were looking at
a new pandemic.
</P>
<P>
   But wondering was almost all they did. Most health departments
were reluctant to condemn eggs or to issue blanket warnings, and
many consumers considered the risk a small one.
</P>
<P>
   As the numbers of cases grew, the CDC's warnings about eggs were
first directed at nursing homes and restaurants; then at people
with weak immune systems, including the very young and very old,
patients with organ transplants, those undergoing cancer therapy
and people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   All these groups together accounted for about a quarter of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1994, the CDC announced that undercooked eggs were safe
for no one. These warnings did not prevent, that very year, the
largest single outbreak of illness so far traced to eggs in
America, when a nationally distributed brand of ice cream made
about 224,000 people ill in 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   There were no eggs in the ice cream itself, but the mixture was
transported in trucks that had previously carried liquid eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak incidentally revealed that, whereas 100,000 cells
of Salmonella were once considered necessary to trigger infection,
as few as ten cells might do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Agriculture Department (USDA), the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and even the egg industry agree that nobody
should eat eggs that have not been thoroughly cooked. But how
dangerous are they? There, confusion is still apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government and the egg industry agree that about one
in 20,000 eggs is actually contaminated: a figure that would put
the average egg-eater at risk only once every 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, however, in a speech at Michigan State University,
Catherine Woteki, the undersecretary for food safety, said that
Salmonella probably caused nearly 900,000 illnesses a year in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, the USDA revised the figure down to 661,633;
but, since Salmonella has a fatality rate of 0.1 percent, this
would still account for 661 deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
   What should be done?
</P>
<P>
   As some scientists in the 1960s and 1970s correctly noted,
Salmonella infection may be rooted in the industrialization of
egg-production. Because egg-laying flocks are closely bred, they
lack genetic variety.
</P>
<P>
   Contaminated feed, dirty sheds and the use of antibiotics may
all add to the risk of disease. Yet so, too, may egg-washing.
</P>
<P>
   Washing not only warms up the egg, which then cools slowly in
the carton, but also removes the natural protective film on the
shell, opening the door to contamination from the washing water.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, after an epidemic of egg-related illnesses in New
England, the USDA started a Salmonella surveillance program which,
among other things, attempted to trace implicated eggs back to the
farm.
</P>
<P>
   But the CDC reported that distributors had begun mixing eggs in
the cartons, which meant that they could not be traced. In 1990,
USDA trace-backs successfully identified the source 86 percent of
the time; by 1993, the number of successful trace-backs had dropped
to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the egg industry has used its influence with a
sympathetic Congress to strike down financing for the
Salmonella-tracking program. Although eggs were identified in 1990
as a ``hazardous food,'' meaning they required refrigeration, the
USDA admitted in 1996 that the rules had never been enforced
because the egg industry felt they were too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   This May, the FDA and the USDA jointly asked for comments on a
new proposal to address the problem of Salmonella in eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerating and date-stamping cartons are two of the
suggestions _ along with the idea that consumers should be educated
about the dangers. At present, they remain in ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are many egg-warnings on the World Wide Web for
computer-literate cooks, there are none on commercial egg cartons:
precisely the place where they might do some good. &QL;

LIABILITY REFORM MAY COME AT COST TO ANTIGUN LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under a bill with the bland name of ``product
liability reform,'' victims of gun violence could find it much
harder to sue gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens may lose much of their ability to bring unrestricted
lawsuits against the gun industry for selling to a felon or a
minor, for marketing weapons with criminal appeal, or for making
dangerous or defective guns that cause accidental harm or death,
legal analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   They also predict the measure could damage recent efforts by
big-city mayors and gun-control advocates to draft lawsuits that
hold the gun industry _ like the tobacco industry _ responsible for
the public health and safety costs associated with their products.
</P>
<P>
   These potential consequences have received little attention,
while the overall bill has won bipartisan support and a nod from
the White House. Supporters say the legislation balances the goal
of protecting businesses from vexing, sometimes frivolous
product-liability litigation with the need of consumers to have
recourse in the courts when they are harmed by defective or unsafe
products.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for action in the Senate this week, the legislation
would require consumers to show that companies acted with
``conscious, flagrant indifference'' to safety, and would make it
more difficult for consumers to win their lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   For small businesses, the bill would limit jury awards for
punitive damages to $250,000. The White House wanted this provision
because small companies have fewer economic resources to draw from,
and need additional protection.
</P>
<P>
   But the provision also means that thousands of gun dealers and
potentially dozens of small manufacturers of guns, particularly
those in California's so-called ``Ring of Fire'' where Saturday
Night Specials are produced, would be protected from the kinds of
million-dollar judgments that have been awarded victims harmed by
firearms produced or marketed negligently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to remove the threat of such lawsuits?'' asked Carl
T. Bogus, a professor at Roger Williams University School of Law in
Bristol, R.I., and an expert on product liability. ``Some of the
most notorious gun manufacturers are in fact small businesses who
promiscuously sell cheap guns. It makes no sense whatever to grant
these people a safe harbor from damages that would be reasonable in
view of willful and egregious conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The product liability legislation is a compromise negotiated by
the White House, Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington,
and Senator Jay Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia, after years
of wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-consumer groups and some legal scholars say the bill, which
would change 50 years of common law, stamps on the rights of
individuals to sue corporations, and interferes with the jury's
privilege to punish a company for negligent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, pro-business groups, including the gun lobby,
hail the bill as a long-awaited reprieve from runaway lawsuits that
hamper commerce and even put people out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a major component of our legislative wish list,''
said Bob Ricker of the American Shooting Sports Council, which
represents firearms manufacturers, retailers, and distributors.
``The tort system has handcuffed our economy. It is ludicrous to
think that a lawyer can experiment with any legal theory in the
courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricker said the bill should ``swing the pendulum'' away from
courtroom fights.
</P>
<P>
   Bogus warned the bill will give the gun industry incentive to
play ``corporate shell games'' and spin off their businesses into
small enterprises that qualify for the exception to avoid liability
in court.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, at least a dozen firearm manufacturers appear to be
small enough to qualify for the small-business exception, according
to a study by the Violence Policy Center, a Washington gun-control
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our point is that you can make a lot of guns that have a real
impact on the market and do it with few people, very cheaply,''
said Kristen Rand, federal policy director for the nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Products like cars and drugs are regulated, guns are not,''
she added. ``The courts are the only thing that function as
regulation, and without them, you are giving the gun industry carte
blanche. ... People don't realize they are giving up their rights.
It's that basic.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and the American Shooting Sports
Council have been working with a large coalition of business groups
called the Product Liability Advisory Committee pushing for tort
reform.
</P>
<P>
   The council also used support of the reforms as a litmus test
for endorsing congressional candidates in its rating system during
the 1996 elections. The NRA also made an election issue out of tort
reform, condemning Clinton for his veto of an earlier version of
the bill in a ``resolution'' to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA did not reply to requests for comment. According to
articles in Guns &AMP; Ammo magazine, the NRA views the proliferation
of lawsuits against manufacturers and distributors as ``a back-door
way to ban guns,'' and tort reform as a way to fend off such
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley and Philadelphia Mayor Edward G.
Rendell have proposed suing firearms manufacturers and distributors
for the costs associated with gun violence in much the same way
that states have gone after the tobacco industry in court.
Gun-control groups, as well as groups of victims, are also suing
the firearms industry.
</P>
<P>
   Ricker does not believe the product-liability bill will impede
these efforts. ``The reason for our support is not special
treatment for our industry, it is because the bill is good for
business and therefore, good for the firearms industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators, including Democrats Dianne Feinstein of
California and Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, want to ensure that
the gun industry remains liable for defective or dangerous
products, and they have drafted an amendment that would exempt it
from the bill's provisions. The tobacco industry already has been
excluded. Debate on the amendment is expected to be heated and the
vote close.

   BENNINGTON, VT. _ Consider the egg: nutritious, inexpensive,
compact, attractively packaged, indispensable in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, according to recently repeated warnings from the
Centers for Disease Control, the Department of Agriculture and even
the egg industry itself, eating eggs in a less than hard-boiled
state may make you ill or even kill you.
</P>
<P>
   Farewell, mayonnaise and hollandaise; farewell, toast soldiers!
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1980s, chicken eggs that were unblemished and
uncracked were widely considered sterile. Now a particular serotype
of Salmonella enteritidis has managed to infect the ovaries of some
hens, and so their eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking kills the bug, but recipes that use raw or lightly
cooked eggs can cause a diarrheal disease which, in serious cases,
can leave victims with arthritis, colon perforations or other
complications.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it leads to death.
</P>
<P>
   Britain was alerted to the problem by the Salmonella outbreaks
between 1982 and 1987. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) saw a
comparable increase in American cases around the same time, and
wondered aloud in medical journals in 1990 if they were looking at
a new pandemic.
</P>
<P>
   But wondering was almost all they did. Most health departments
were reluctant to condemn eggs or to issue blanket warnings, and
many consumers considered the risk a small one.
</P>
<P>
   As the numbers of cases grew, the CDC's warnings about eggs were
first directed at nursing homes and restaurants; then at people
with weak immune systems, including the very young and very old,
patients with organ transplants, those undergoing cancer therapy
and people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   All these groups together accounted for about a quarter of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1994, the CDC announced that undercooked eggs were safe
for no one. These warnings did not prevent, that very year, the
largest single outbreak of illness so far traced to eggs in
America, when a nationally distributed brand of ice cream made
about 224,000 people ill in 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   There were no eggs in the ice cream itself, but the mixture was
transported in trucks that had previously carried liquid eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak incidentally revealed that, whereas 100,000 cells
of Salmonella were once considered necessary to trigger infection,
as few as ten cells might do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Agriculture Department (USDA), the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and even the egg industry agree that nobody
should eat eggs that have not been thoroughly cooked. But how
dangerous are they? There, confusion is still apparent.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Bill Clinton had not long been in China before his
American tormentors began to change their tune.
</P>
<P>
   Stories that Clinton was embarrassed by the brief detention of a
handful of dissidents and China's denial of visas for some
journalists turned to grudging respect when 100,000 ordinary
Chinese welcomed him in Xian.
</P>
<P>
   But what really made the difference was a debate with China's
president, Jiang Zemin, on June 27. This was broadcast live on
state television.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed America's disapproval of the Tiananmen Square
killings in June 1989 and criticized China's behavior in Tibet,
calling for a dialogue between Jiang and the Tibetans' exiled
leader, the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later a speech and lively question-and-answer session
with students at Beijing University was also broadcast live.
Clinton stoutly defended American principles and said they would be
good for China too.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute decision by the Chinese authorities to allow
these events to be broadcast live took even the Americans by
surprise. Clinton's visit replaced the World Cup as the capital's
main topic of conversation in this lively week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took his campaign style to China. Officials among his
huge entourage were flushed with delight that the president's mix
of empathy, robustness and good humor appeared to go down so well.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese had not heard criticism of official policy aired in
this way before. It came as a surprise to many to hear that the man
whom most Chinese know as ``the splittist, so-called Dalai Lama''
was, according to Clinton, a nice, holy man whom Jiang might like
to meet.
</P>
<P>
   The ``June 4th incident,'' as the Tiananmen Square massacre are
known in official jargon, is rarely mentioned by the state media.
Jiang said nothing startling about Tiananmen in reply, only that
stability today would not have been possible without an iron fist
then.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact that he said anything at all in defense of the
tanks was remarkable. China has only once before seen a political
leader in a freewheeling press conference: Zhu Rongji gave one when
he became prime minister in March.
</P>
<P>
   The country had never seen its president in lively debate. For
some of the time at least, Jiang even appeared to enjoy himself.
The exchange has given the Chinese a new image of their leadership,
which may be one reason why Jiang did it.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that Jiang may have considered the resumption of
``normal'' relations with America, nine years after Tiananmen,
important enough for him to adopt this American way of doing things
during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang certainly longs for stature on the world stage in a way
that no previous Chinese communist leader has done. He clearly
enjoyed the pomp and attention accorded his own state visit to
America last autumn, and is said to have considered it a matter of
honor that the welcome he received should be reciprocated in full.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Chinese think Jiang may have turned into something
of an Americanophile.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the greater openness also reflects changes in Chinese
politics. Since the death of China's paramount leader, Deng
Xiaoping, early last year, a good deal of wooden dogma has
disappeared from the Communist Party's words and deeds.
</P>
<P>
   The state media have become somewhat more cosmopolitan and
adventurous: it is no longer considered daring to expose party
shortcomings, at least at the local level.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and Zhu both vigorously promote greater ``democracy'' at
the grass roots as a way of achieving more accountability. And they
probably agree, up to a point, with Clinton's assertion that civil
liberties underpin economic development. At the least, a more
relaxed political climate helps undermine left-wing opposition to
their painful economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that Jiang intends to introduce a faster pace of
political change, bringing the experiment in grass-roots democracy
from the countryside _ where it extends, albeit imperfectly, up to
the county level _ into the cities and perhaps even to national
government.
</P>
<P>
   If so, does this again risk popular expectations racing beyond
the Communist Party's willingness to deliver? Not if the students
at Beijing University are anything to go by. Long famous for
challenging the establishment, in 1989 it set the Tiananmen agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays the students are far less radical, and many are not
even sympathetic to those who protested at Tiananmen. Most were
impressed with Clinton, especially as he did not hector China when
talking about American ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, says one, ``democracy'' is for America, whereas
``stability'' is for China.
</P>
<P>
   Those of the Tiananmen generation complain that such views show
today's students have been brainwashed by years of propaganda. But
there is another explanation. In 1989, party corruption, entrenched
statism and a worsening economic outlook dashed youthful hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Now no other generation in China has been able to look forward
as much to the possibility of a good career and a freer life.
</P>
<P>
   If Beijing University's students show any stridency, it is a
nationalism tinged with chauvinism. Students are as prickly as
their government over Taiwan. Many insist that America's arms sales
to the island are an overt form of support for independence. What,
one student asked Clinton, are you hiding behind your smile?
</P>
<P>
   Jiang will face criticism inside the party for allowing Clinton
to orchestrate the show. But he will no doubt defend the visit as a
success for China too.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some people close to Jiang appear to support some
sort of accommodation with the Dalai Lama in a way that might,
conceivably, release the thousands of Chinese troops pinned down on
the roof of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang himself will also claim to have got a greater public
assurance from Clinton over Taiwan than before.
</P>
<P>
   And there is other compensation. Japan, India and Taiwan have
expressed concern that China and America might be forging a new and
powerful partnership in the region. Though the perception of that
is more powerful than the reality, it will greatly please China's
masters. &QL;

<P>
   Stories that Clinton was embarrassed by the brief detention of a
handful of dissidents and China's denial of visas for some
journalists turned to grudging respect when 100,000 ordinary
Chinese welcomed him in Xian.
</P>
<P>
   But what really made the difference was a debate with China's
president, Jiang Zemin, on June 27. This was broadcast live on
state television.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed America's disapproval of the Tiananmen Square
killings in June 1989 and criticized China's behavior in Tibet,
calling for a dialogue between Jiang and the Tibetans' exiled
leader, the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later a speech and lively question-and-answer session
with students at Beijing University was also broadcast live.
Clinton stoutly defended American principles and said they would be
good for China too.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute decision by the Chinese authorities to allow
these events to be broadcast live took even the Americans by
surprise. Clinton's visit replaced the World Cup as the capital's
main topic of conversation in this lively week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took his campaign style to China. Officials among his
huge entourage were flushed with delight that the president's mix
of empathy, robustness and good humor appeared to go down so well.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese had not heard criticism of official policy aired in
this way before. It came as a surprise to many to hear that the man
whom most Chinese know as ``the splittist, so-called Dalai Lama''
was, according to Clinton, a nice, holy man whom Jiang might like
to meet.
</P>
<P>
   The ``June 4th incident,'' as the Tiananmen Square massacre are
known in official jargon, is rarely mentioned by the state media.
Jiang said nothing startling about Tiananmen in reply, only that
stability today would not have been possible without an iron fist
then.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact that he said anything at all in defense of the
tanks was remarkable. China has only once before seen a political
leader in a freewheeling press conference: Zhu Rongji gave one when
he became prime minister in March.
</P>
<P>
   The country had never seen its president in lively debate. For
some of the time at least, Jiang even appeared to enjoy himself.
The exchange has given the Chinese a new image of their leadership,
which may be one reason why Jiang did it.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that Jiang may have considered the resumption of
``normal'' relations with America, nine years after Tiananmen,
important enough for him to adopt this American way of doing things
during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang certainly longs for stature on the world stage in a way
that no previous Chinese communist leader has done. He clearly
enjoyed the pomp and attention accorded his own state visit to
America last autumn, and is said to have considered it a matter of
honor that the welcome he received should be reciprocated in full.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Chinese think Jiang may have turned into something
of an Americanophile.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the greater openness also reflects changes in Chinese
politics. Since the death of China's paramount leader, Deng
Xiaoping, early last year, a good deal of wooden dogma has
disappeared from the Communist Party's words and deeds.
</P>
<P>
   The state media have become somewhat more cosmopolitan and
adventurous: it is no longer considered daring to expose party
shortcomings, at least at the local level.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and Zhu both vigorously promote greater ``democracy'' at
the grass roots as a way of achieving more accountability. And they
probably agree, up to a point, with Clinton's assertion that civil
liberties underpin economic development. At the least, a more
relaxed political climate helps undermine left-wing opposition to
their painful economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that Jiang intends to introduce a faster pace of
political change, bringing the experiment in grass-roots democracy
from the countryside _ where it extends, albeit imperfectly, up to
the county level _ into the cities and perhaps even to national
government.
</P>
<P>
   If so, does this again risk popular expectations racing beyond
the Communist Party's willingness to deliver? Not if the students
at Beijing University are anything to go by. Long famous for
challenging the establishment, in 1989 it set the Tiananmen agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays the students are far less radical, and many are not
even sympathetic to those who protested at Tiananmen. Most were
impressed with Clinton, especially as he did not hector China when
talking about American ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, says one, ``democracy'' is for America, whereas
``stability'' is for China.
</P>
<P>
   Those of the Tiananmen generation complain that such views show
today's students have been brainwashed by years of propaganda. But
there is another explanation. In 1989, party corruption, entrenched
statism and a worsening economic outlook dashed youthful hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Now no other generation in China has been able to look forward
as much to the possibility of a good career and a freer life.
</P>
<P>
   If Beijing University's students show any stridency, it is a
nationalism tinged with chauvinism. Students are as prickly as
their government over Taiwan. Many insist that America's arms sales
to the island are an overt form of support for independence. What,
one student asked Clinton, are you hiding behind your smile?
</P>
<P>
   Jiang will face criticism inside the party for allowing Clinton
to orchestrate the show. But he will no doubt defend the visit as a
success for China too.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some people close to Jiang appear to support some
sort of accommodation with the Dalai Lama in a way that might,
conceivably, release the thousands of Chinese troops pinned down on
the roof of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang himself will also claim to have got a greater public
assurance from Clinton over Taiwan than before.
</P>
<P>
   And there is other compensation. Japan, India and Taiwan have
expressed concern that China and America might be forging a new and
powerful partnership in the region. Though the perception of that
is more powerful than the reality, it will greatly please China's
masters. &QL;

<P>
   It was 1992, and a dark time for Honda. The legendary founder,
Soichiro Honda, had recently died. Rumors were circulating that the
company _ maker of the best-engineered Japanese cars _ was about to
be absorbed by its dreaded rival, Mitsubishi Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Bills were piling up from the financial follies of the 1980s,
the company had no new models and the economy was heading downhill
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's boss, did something painful, symbolic
and central to the strategy that has brought Honda back to life: he
axed the company's prized Formula One motor-racing division.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expected it, because Kawamoto, who retires this week, has
worshipped fast machines all his life. The second word he learned,
as he watched Japanese fighters soaring skyward, was hikoki
(airplane).
</P>
<P>
   As a young engineering graduate at Tohoku University, he
secretly spent the proceeds of a national scholarship on a
secondhand motorbike for racing, while his family, unaware, kept
sending an allowance and paying the tuition fees. (Years later, his
wife made him repay his father.)
</P>
<P>
   When he joined Honda in 1963, Kawamoto wangled his way into the
research department, so he could work on racing motorbikes and
engines for racing cars. As a young board member he was threatened
with the sack for spending his time tinkering in the workshops and
skipping board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   One of Honda's most original racing-car designs was sketched on
Kawamoto's doodle pad during a tedious board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Honda was just the place for the young Kawamoto. It was supreme
in motor racing, winning the world car-constructors championship
for six years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Its agile little motor cars had all the poise and balance of the
motor bikes it built alongside them. It went on to turn out
exquisite masterpieces such as the all-aluminium NSX supercar,
capable of going wheel-to-wheel with any Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, it drew gasps of admiration from rivals
with diminutive little mid-engined two-seaters like the Beat. The
company disdained vans and light trucks as the sort of thing
produced by the mere metal-bashers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Kawamoto took over as president and chief executive
in 1990, Honda was in thrall to its engineers _ a priesthood housed
in separate premises, untroubled by the dismal businesses of
marketing and accounting, with a say in everything from piston size
to pricing.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy soaring in the late 1980s, it hardly seemed to
matter that customers were not lining up to buy Honda's flights of
engineering fancy. There was always money to be made from sensible
Civics, Accords and dozens of different types of motorbike.
</P>
<P>
   But things were already going wrong. Honda's focus on clever
machines had diverted it from the dull matters that make a business
tick _ paying attention to what the customer wants and producing it
at a reasonable cost. By 1990, Honda was taking nearly twice as
long to get a new model into production as Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's culture had to change; but nothing in its culture told
it how. Fortunately, Kawamoto had the imagination to think beyond
his discipline.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the man who had run Honda's Grand Prix program
showed the company what its priorities should be by putting an end
to its involvement in Formula One racing. And after that, the
company's most senior engineer pushed his fellow engineers from
behind the steering wheel and handed the keys to the manufacturing
and marketing men.
</P>
<P>
   Kawamoto turned the management system upside down. He got rid of
``Honda-ism,'' a collegiate style of decision-making, and
introduced instead a top-down management that brooked no dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Out also went the sacrosanct Japanese seniority system. Now
people are paid and promoted strictly on merit.
</P>
<P>
   Most revolutionary of all, Kawamoto started asking potential
customers what they wanted from a car instead of letting the
engineers dream up designs they deemed the public should have.
</P>
<P>
   Market research revealed that aging baby boomers and their
children were tired of boring, functional sedans _ no matter how
clever their design. They longed for recreational vehicles (RVs) _
vans and Jeep-like off-roaders kitted out with the latest gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Honda has rushed out a series of RVs, starting with
the hugely successful Odyssey seven-seater in 1994, then the CR-V,
the Step Wagon, the SM-X and now the little Capa wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the boxy clothing of each lies a platform and
power-train borrowed from one of Honda's more popular sedans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the engineers would have thrown up their hands in
horror and insisted on designing each new vehicle from scratch. But
the cars-in-vans'-clothing have transformed Honda's fortunes and
now account for more than 70 percent of the company's domestic
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Honda is one of only two car firms in Japan making
serious money (the other remains Toyota), and the only one whose
sales are growing.
</P>
<P>
   Kawamoto saved Honda by betraying his traditions, but he himself
hasn't really changed, as his retirement plans suggest. ``I don't
play golf and I don't sing karaoke,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks about cars; and when he isn't thinking about them, he
is restoring or racing them _ indeed, he might well run Honda's new
team from Britain when it returns to Formula One racing in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the big question that his successor, Hiroyuki
Yoshino, another engineer who came up through R&AMP;D, will have to
face. Companies are as hard to change as people; so, now that Honda
is out of trouble, will it revert to its engineering-driven,
self-indulgent self? &QL;

showed the company what its priorities should be by putting an end
to its involvement in Formula One racing. And after that, the
company's most senior engineer pushed his fellow engineers from
behind the steering wheel and handed the keys to the manufacturing
and marketing men.
</P>
<P>
   Kawamoto turned the management system upside down. He got rid of
``Honda-ism,'' a collegiate style of decision-making, and
introduced instead a top-down management that brooked no dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Out also went the sacrosanct Japanese seniority system. Now
people are paid and promoted strictly on merit.
</P>
<P>
   Most revolutionary of all, Kawamoto started asking potential
customers what they wanted from a car instead of letting the
engineers dream up designs they deemed the public should have.
</P>
<P>
   Market research revealed that aging baby boomers and their
children were tired of boring, functional sedans _ no matter how
clever their design. They longed for recreational vehicles (RVs) _
vans and Jeep-like off-roaders kitted out with the latest gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Honda has rushed out a series of RVs, starting with
the hugely successful Odyssey seven-seater in 1994, then the CR-V,
the Step Wagon, the SM-X and now the little Capa wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the boxy clothing of each lies a platform and
power-train borrowed from one of Honda's more popular sedans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the engineers would have thrown up their hands in
horror and insisted on designing each new vehicle from scratch. But
the cars-in-vans'-clothing have transformed Honda's fortunes and
now account for more than 70 percent of the company's domestic
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Honda is one of only two car firms in Japan making
serious money (the other remains Toyota), and the only one whose
sales are growing.
</P>
<P>
   Kawamoto saved Honda by betraying his traditions, but he himself
hasn't really changed, as his retirement plans suggest. ``I don't
play golf and I don't sing karaoke,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks about cars; and when he isn't thinking about them, he
is restoring or racing them _ indeed, he might well run Honda's new
team from Britain when it returns to Formula One racing in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the big question that his successor, Hiroyuki
Yoshino, another engineer who came up through R&AMP;D, will have to
face. Companies are as hard to change as people; so, now that Honda
is out of trouble, will it revert to its engineering-driven,
self-indulgent self? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 1992, and a dark time for Honda. The legendary founder,
Soichiro Honda, had recently died. Rumors were circulating that the
company _ maker of the best-engineered Japanese cars _ was about to
be absorbed by its dreaded rival, Mitsubishi Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Bills were piling up from the financial follies of the 1980s,
the company had no new models and the economy was heading downhill
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's boss, did something painful, symbolic
and central to the strategy that has brought Honda back to life: he
axed the company's prized Formula One motor-racing division.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expected it, because Kawamoto, who retires this week, has
worshipped fast machines all his life. The second word he learned,
as he watched Japanese fighters soaring skyward, was hikoki
(airplane).
</P>
<P>
   As a young engineering graduate at Tohoku University, he
secretly spent the proceeds of a national scholarship on a
secondhand motorbike for racing, while his family, unaware, kept
sending an allowance and paying the tuition fees. (Years later, his
wife made him repay his father.)
</P>
<P>
   When he joined Honda in 1963, Kawamoto wangled his way into the
research department, so he could work on racing motorbikes and
engines for racing cars. As a young board member he was threatened
with the sack for spending his time tinkering in the workshops and
skipping board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   One of Honda's most original racing-car designs was sketched on
Kawamoto's doodle pad during a tedious board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Honda was just the place for the young Kawamoto. It was supreme
in motor racing, winning the world car-constructors championship
for six years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Its agile little motor cars had all the poise and balance of the
motor bikes it built alongside them. It went on to turn out
exquisite masterpieces such as the all-aluminium NSX supercar,
capable of going wheel-to-wheel with any Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, it drew gasps of admiration from rivals
with diminutive little mid-engined two-seaters like the Beat. The
company disdained vans and light trucks as the sort of thing
produced by the mere metal-bashers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Kawamoto took over as president and chief executive
in 1990, Honda was in thrall to its engineers _ a priesthood housed
in separate premises, untroubled by the dismal businesses of
marketing and accounting, with a say in everything from piston size
to pricing.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy soaring in the late 1980s, it hardly seemed to
matter that customers were not lining up to buy Honda's flights of
engineering fancy. There was always money to be made from sensible
Civics, Accords and dozens of different types of motorbike.
</P>
<P>
   But things were already going wrong. Honda's focus on clever
machines had diverted it from the dull matters that make a business
tick _ paying attention to what the customer wants and producing it
at a reasonable cost. By 1990, Honda was taking nearly twice as
long to get a new model into production as Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's culture had to change; but nothing in its culture told
it how. Fortunately, Kawamoto had the imagination to think beyond
his discipline.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the man who had run Honda's Grand Prix program
showed the company what its priorities should be by putting an end
to its involvement in Formula One racing. And after that, the
company's most senior engineer pushed his fellow engineers from
behind the steering wheel and handed the keys to the manufacturing
and marketing men.
</P>
<P>
   Kawamoto turned the management system upside down. He got rid of
``Honda-ism,'' a collegiate style of decision-making, and
introduced instead a top-down management that brooked no dissent.
</P>
<P>

people are paid and promoted strictly on merit.
</P>
<P>
   Most revolutionary of all, Kawamoto started asking potential
customers what they wanted from a car instead of letting the

MINERS SEETHE OVER THEIR FATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VORKUTA, Russia _ The skeletons of Stalin's gulag still ring
this barren arctic city. Crumbling prison walls and abandoned
wooden crosses in the tundra are stark reminders of the thousands
of slave laborers who built Vorkuta and founded the coal mines that
surround it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the miners of Vorkuta have something else to remind them of
their unfortunate forefathers: their own jobs. For something
resembling slavery has returned to this city of 180,000, located on
a bleak tundra plain at the foot of the Polar Urals, 1,250 miles
northeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   For the worst thing about being a miner in Russia's Far North is
not that people were never intended to build cities in this place,
where it snows despite round-the-clock daylight in summer and where
winter is six months of frigid night. The worst thing is not that
there is no place to go, and that the only jobs are in the mines,
where abysmal safety standards and outdated equipment cause an
average of two fatal accidents each week.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing is the feeling the miners have _ that while they
go months without pay, the mines are making their bosses incredibly
rich. And that is making the miners of Vorkuta angry.
</P>
<P>
   In May, they took the city's mayor and the directors of the main
mining company hostage for 10 days. For the past two weeks, 200
Vorkuta miners have picketed the federal government building in
Moscow, where they bang their plastic helmets on the pavement.
Their demand is no longer that the government pay off some $56
million in back wages. They now say they will not be happy until
President Boris N. Yeltsin resigns.
</P>
<P>
   That should sound a warning to Yeltsin, who rode to power on the
wave of protest that began with miners' strikes in Vorkuta in 1989
and spread across the great Kuzbass mining region of Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, miners across the country are planning a reprise of their
protest in May, when they blocked critical train routes, crippling
Russia's supply lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as million-strong meetings raised Yeltsin to power in
1991, we now hope to show with million-strong meetings that the
people are frankly tired of him,'' Alexander Sergeyev, head of the
Independent Miners' Union, said last month.
</P>
<P>
   But in Vorkuta, the possibility of new nationwide protests is
greeted with tempered enthusiasm. When miners in Inta, a city 100
miles southwest of here, sat on the rails in protest last May, it
was Vorkuta that stopped receiving food and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we strike, it hits us in our own pockets,'' said Yevgeny
Shumeiko, deputy head of the Vorkuta miners' union.
</P>
<P>
   Miners in the rest of Russia can survive when they strike,
thanks to the garden plots that produce as much as 50 percent of
Russia's produce. But in the permafrost around Vorkuta, nothing
grows except lichen and low bushes. Even the polar aspens brought
to enliven Vorkuta's barren streets have trouble surviving.
Potatoes, the Russian dietary staple, are out of the question here.
</P>
<P>
   In a dingy hallway at the Severny mine, Shumeiko displayed the
humble rations that miners can buy for a dollar each: a hardboiled
egg, some stale bread and old sausage. With no money and no other
way to get food, miners charge up to 10 such rations a day against
their salaries and take them home to their families. For the
average miner, that means as much as half of his monthly salary of
about $400 goes toward purchasing rations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The slaves of Rome lived better. At least they were properly
fed,'' said Ravin, a worker at the Severny mine near Vorkuta, who
reluctantly gave only his first name.
</P>
<P>
   Ravin produced a slip of paper that details how much he is owed
_ over $6,000 in wages and benefits. The pay stub shows that income
taxes have been deducted each month, even on money Ravin did not
receive. His conclusion is that the mine got the money. It just
never made it to him.
</P>
<P>
   He waved at the tundra, its bleak monotony broken only by the
mountains on the horizon and a ring of distant smokestacks,
billowing sulfurous yellow smoke into the artic air.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``This place is one big prison camp, and we are the
prisoners,'' Ravin said.
</P>
<P>
   Ravin and other Vorkuta miners sense that their directors, and
senior union leaders, are getting rich while holding back payments
to workers. The head of the miners' union in Severny has opened an
expensive supermarket. (``We'd like to know how he did it, if his
salary is as late as ours,'' said Ravin.)
</P>
<P>
   The wealthiest businessman in Vorkuta is the son of the mining
conglomerate's former director. Miners at Severny say they are
forced to work Sundays, producing coal that does not show up in any
of the mine's accounts. They suspect this coal is being sold at cut
rates for cash, which the directors pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know where the coal goes. We only know that the
bosses' salaries are never late,'' said a miner who asked that his
name not be used. ``You could put them all in jail right now, if
only anyone had the will to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when money does arrive, getting it is another problem.
Payroll accountants gladly pay the miners their salaries, for a fee
of 10 percent of the paycheck, according to Alexandra Kuzina,
editor of the local daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's humiliating to have to beg for your own money,''
commented Severny miner Zhenya Zheredetsky. ``You earned it, and
yet you have to drag it out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   It used to mean something to be a miner in Vorkuta. Although
political prisoners built the place, in the 1960s and 1970s people
flocked to Vorkuta, lured by the comparably high salaries and
lucrative benefits offered by the Soviet government, and spurred on
by the ``More Coal to the Motherland'' slogan still prominently
displayed in Vorkuta's central square.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1991 Soviet breakup, however, the Kremlin has been
trying to improve efficiency in Russia's massive and unsafe mines.
Subsidies to coal mines were slashed in 1994. A new slogan appeared
over Vorkuta: ``More Coal with Fewer Workers.''
</P>
<P>
   But the miners have nowhere to go. Without cash, they have no
way to move south. Federal programs to move them have failed thus
far, partly because funds intended for relocation and retraining
programs were used to pay wage arrears.
</P>
<P>
   As with most of Russia's ailing large enterprises, there is no
consensus on who is responsible. Vyacheslav Davydov, the spokesman
of the state-owned conglomerate that runs the mines, says the
government causes the wage problem by failing to pay its bills on
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the money we get, we put towards paying people,'' Davydov
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, the government's point
man on the mining problem, counters that the problem is corrupt and
inefficient management.
</P>
<P>
   Probably directors and the Kremlin share the guilt for overdue
wages for all large Russian firms, mines included. Unwilling to pay
the social cost of mass unemployment, Moscow has been slow to push
bankruptcy laws against companies that cannot pay their debts to
their workers. Instead, the government has granted subsidies to
firms that are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't get paid when the people who are supposed to pay
them can get away with not paying them,'' said Rory MacFarquar, an
economist at the Russian-European Center for Economic Reforms in
Moscow. ``If it turns out that you can get a larger subsidy from
the government when you run up wage arrears, you will run up wage
arrears.''
</P>
<P>
   While the state and the managers try to work out who is at
fault, the miners are losing patience. Two weeks ago, a miner at
Severny hanged himself in the shaft. A woman who is owed $6,000
threatened to throw herself into the shaft of the Komsomolsky mine
unless she was paid.
</P>
<P>
   Shumeiko, the union leader, rushed to the mine to talk the
director into paying her at least something, and the woman did not
jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this keeps up, we won't be able to stop the people from
rising up,'' Shumeiko said.
</P>
<P>
   Shumeiko said he would like to get to the bottom of what really
happens to the money. But he has more immediate concerns, such as
dealing with the safety of the mines' aging, outdated equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Recently a miner was killed as he tried to repair a huge machine
that bores a tunnel into the earth, spitting out huge blocks of
coal at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for their often tragic consequences, safety
standards in the mines would be laughable. For example, to detect
dangerous methane deposits that can cause a blast like the one in
January that killed 26 miners, workers at Severny rely on rats. If
there are rats in the mine, there is no methane. No rats, and the
area is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that the rats are attracted by the rations the
miners bring with them. And since most miners have stopped eating
in the pits, instead bringing their rations home, fewer rats
descend into the shafts, making it harder to detect the methane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the rats know,'' said Vorkuta miner Nikolai Avkhimenko,
``to get out of this place.''

HAPPY TRAILS, ROY ROGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roy Rogers was really a guy named Leonard Slye who was born in
Cincinnati but grew up in Marietta, Ohio. The fact that he was a
fellow Ohioan was not lost on me. Even as a 6-year-old
member-in-good-standing of the Roy Rogers Club, Columbus chapter, I
felt we had a special bond.
</P>
<P>
   When I heard that Roy Rogers had died Monday, at age 86, it was
like saying goodbye to a piece of my childhood. Closing a chapter
of innocence, I suppose, where the good guys really did wear the
white hats and ride in on stallions so golden and heroic, you
almost had to wear sunglasses to watch them canter across the
silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   Roy was handsome. His eyes tilted up like a Tatar tribesman with
a Cherokee ancestor. He was whippet-slim and moved like a dancer,
which is pretty hard to do in high-heeled cowboy boots equipped
with jingling spurs. He had the requisite six-gun and was really
good with his fists. His pal was a bearded old codger named Gabby
who complained a lot in a high, gruff voice, which Roy took so
good-naturedly; Gabby drove Nellybelle the Jeep, and Roy's love
interest, Dale, rode her own dun-colored Palomino mare named
Buttermilk.
</P>
<P>
   I never wanted to be Dale. No, sir. She was real cute and all
with her tightly curled coif, white cowboy hat, sunny disposition
and smile, and those nifty skirts with the buckskin fringe. But she
was just an accessory, and quite incidental to the movies' plots,
which got recycled every outing.
</P>
<P>
   When you were a girlchild of my vintage, pre-Barbie, you focused
on one of two things: You either wanted to be a ballerina or own a
horse. My Aunt Ruby's caretaker had taken me over a low jump on the
front of his saddle on a huge bay gelding when I was 4. So the
choice was a no-brainer. I went horse crazy. And absolutely crazy
over the Stetson-wearing guys who rode them.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a first-grader, my mother started giving me 30 cents
every Saturday to go to the Roy Rogers movies at the Drexel Theater
on Main Street, right next door to my school. I would walk the six
blocks down Sheridan Avenue, which was the first street in our
little community, on the wrong side of the Main Street and almost
not even Bexley, Ohio, at all. The popular kids lived between Main
and Broad. I lived in what my Jewish mother called ``erev (almost)
Bexley,'' but before I understood what snobbism, Spaulding shoes,
cashmere sweaters, box-pleated skirts and boyfriends with letter
sweaters were all about, I was in love with Roy.
</P>
<P>
   So Mama, in her wisdom, allowed me my fantasy. She never tried
to talk me out of wanting to be this studly cowboy who was on the
side of right. She dutifully counted out the quarter and the nickel
each Saturday and sent me and my friend Debbie on our way to the
11:30 a.m. show. The money was divvied up thusly: 15 cents for the
movie, 10 cents for popcorn and five cents for a Sugar Daddy, which
lasted a long time and was responsible for pulling out a couple of
front teeth before it was time for them to go.
</P>
<P>
   We'd file into the Drexel Theater, an Art Deco leftover. Cool
terrazzo tile on the floor, worn maroon seats and the smell of
freshly popped popcorn mingled with bathroom deodorizer are the
sense memories I can still summon up today. We showed our numbered
membership cards, and before the entertainments started, there was
always a drawing. I won a Roy Rogers lunch box once, a Dale lasso
another time. Who knows what they're worth on the collectors'
market now?
</P>
<P>
   Then the lights would dim and the show would start. We'd have a
Tom and Jerry cartoon, then a Buck Rogers or Boston Blackie serial.
And then finally, the Roy Rogers cowboy movie, with sweating horses
galloping into impossible terrain or through arroyos (all the
better for them evil sidewinders to bushwhack our hero) or over the
sagebrushed desert. There was nothing Roy did that wasn't perfect,
legal and up-front. He was never wily or underhanded.
</P>
<P>
   And he didn't hide his face behind a mask. He wasn't chunky like
the Other Guy, Gene Artery, we called him. He had a whiskey tenor
and when he sang with the Sons of the Pioneers, it was pure
heaven-on-a-stick.
</P>
<P>
   I still know the words to ``Blue Shadows on the Trail'' and
``Riders in the Sky.'' My parents realized that I could sing when
they bought me an album of Roy's songs and heard me singing along
with the music on my old Victrola.
</P>
<P>
   Roy married Dale. They adopted a passel of inter-racial kids and
became good and high-profile Christians. They lost a child and Dale
wrote a book about it. I admired what they were able to do. I hated
it when Roy stuffed Trigger. Some wag I know figures somebody will
stuff Roy, too. And I outgrew wanting to be a cowboy. I fixated on
Brenda Starr and became her instead.
</P>
<P>
   So now he's gone and that part of my childhood is finally over.
Happy Trails, my friend.

DEFYING THE LAWS OF NATURE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earth-bound asteroids and comets seem to have an uncanny knack
for aiming straight at the world's major cities _ especially New
York _ and laying them flat, just as surely as tornadoes always
seem to aim for trailer parks.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the case in most of the movies ever made about
the Earth being battered from above, including this summer's big
duo _ ``Deep Impact'' and ``Armageddon'' _ blockbusters
(literally). But although the Big Apple is reduced to applesauce in
both of them, at least ``Deep Impact'' does it in a way that makes
scientific sense.
</P>
<P>
   That affinity for cities is cinematically understandable; after
all, watching the Chrysler building or the Statue of Liberty come
crumbling down is a lot more visually exciting than watching an
impact on a wheatfield in Kansas or some sand dunes in the Sahara.
But it's just one of many quibbles and questions that scientists
have raised about the latest rage in disaster flicks.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, most astronomers seem somewhat mollified by their
expectation that, that despite the usual slew of inaccuracies, the
release of ``Armageddon'' last week, following that of ``Deep
Impact'' in May will, if nothing else, greatly raise the public's
awareness of the real risk our planet faces from an impact someday.
And overall, they say ``Deep Impact'' comes a whole lot closer than
any movie before or since to getting the scientific facts of
impacts right _ although that may not be saying a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less inaccurate than the others,'' said Dan Green,
assistant director of the real-life central clearinghouse in
Cambridge, where all discoveries of asteroids and comets are first
sent. ``That's not saying much, but I would say that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Other astronomers have been more positive. David Morrison, head
of space research at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Ames Research Center in California, said that
``one can always nitpick the science, but in my opinion there is
not one serious error in this film _ nothing that damages its basic
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison especially praises the way ``Deep Impact'' portrays the
effects of the impact, in particular the tsunami (what people often
call a tidal wave) that actually flattens New York in that film,
rather than the impacting object itself. As recent computer
simulations at the Los Alamos National Laboratory have shown, an
impact anywhere in the North Atlantic really would innundate New
York, Washington, and most of the East Coast, rushing many miles
inland with a wall of water that could tower thousands of feet high
in some places.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie was at least 100 times better than `Asteroid,'''
last year's TV miniseries about an impact that homes in on Dallas,
said Clark Chapman, an astronomer at the Southwest Research
Institute in Boulder, Colo., who specializes in the study of
asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon,'' on the other hand, gets uniformly bad reviews
from the scientists _ even those who haven't seen it yet; they say
it's clear just from basic descriptions that most of its basic
premises are flat-out impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely impossible,'' says Green of the movie's central
storyline: That an asteroid the size of Texas is discovered on a
collision course with Earth, just 18 days before the expected
impact. ``There's only one object in the solar system known to be
that size,'' the asteroid Ceres _ an object so bright and
unmistakable that it was discovered way back in 1801, before the
advent of powerful telescopes. ``Anything that kind of size would
be too bright to miss.'' And Ceres never comes within tens of
millions of miles of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers were also a bit harsh in their criticism of the way
``Armageddon'' depicts a series of smaller objects, apparently
thrown into a collision course by the huge asteroid, that come
crashing to Earth sporadically whenever there's a lull in the
action in the weeks before the Big One is due. And, of course,
these precursor impacts head straight for the cities of New York
(where the tiny objects seem to come flying in from all sides; in a
a true meteor shower, everything comes from a single direction) and
Paris (which gets flattened by one big object in one of the film's
few realistic scenes).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nuts,'' said Chapman. `'It doesn't make scientific
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Both films took the rather unusual step (by Hollywood standards)
of hiring technical consultants for the rocket sequences, in which
astronauts head out to intercept the doomsday rocks and nuke them
to bits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' had the full cooperation of NASA itself, and did
some filimg at the Kennedy Space Center; in fact, the movie's
premiere was held at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you'd know it from the movie. The rockets it uses to
intercept the incoming asteroid hundreds of thousands of miles out
in space look exactly like the space shuttle, whose ceiling is
about 300 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Impact'' also uses shuttle-like rockets to intercept the
speeding comet, but at least those craft are clearly much larger
and quite different from the familiar shuttle. The script gets
around the problem of deep-space travel by describing them as new
nuclear-powered rockets that were secretly assembled in orbit.
Astronomers say keeping something like that secret would be
impossible _ the vehicles are described as larger than the Mir
space station, which is so bright that it can easily be spotted
passing overhead on clear nights, unmistakably visible to the naked
eye. But the rocket science makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking as a former NASA rocket scientist,'' engineer Keith
Cowing wrote recently in an Internet newsletter, ``the technology
(in ``Deep Impact'') is portrayed quite realistically, the
celestial scenery is done very well, and the cataclysmic effects of
a cometary impact are masterfully realized.'' He added that ``given
Hollywood's chronic habit of violating the laws of physics, this
movie is a rather notable exception.''
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because, unlike ``Armageddon,'' the makers of
``Deep Impact'' also hired several consultants to help them get it
right on the nature of comets and the effects of an impact, and the
initial script was written by screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin, who
had extensive interviews with researchers and sat through days of
scholarly meetings about the latest research on the asteroid
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Rubin was fired early-on in the film's
production. And the movie-makers didn't always heed some of the
consultants it paid to advise them, including the highly-respected
husband-and-wife team of comet and asteroid specialists Carolyn and
the late Eugene Shoemaker. So though it's much better than most,
``Deep Impact'' still has its lapses.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the comet is said to have been discovered about
two years before the predicted impact, by amateur astronomers at a
star party. That's reasonable _ many comets are found by amateurs,
and Thomas Bopp of Hale-Bopp fame made his discovery at a star
party in Arizona. The problem is, the film places the comet next to
the Big Dipper stars Alcor and Mizar, and it appears much brighter
than those bright naked-eye stars. Then, it's mysteriously lost
from view and its existence is suppressed by the government for
another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a break!'' said Green in an interview last week. It
would be impossible to suppress that kind of phenomenon in a
wide-open field like astronomy _ an object so bright that anyone
could see it just by looking up. And another thing: To have been
that bright so long before impact _ and thus, so far away from
Earth _ it ``would have to be about the size of Texas,'' Green
said. And no known comet has been much bigger than Dallas, much
less Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of Chapman, who was reached by telephone last
week at an international meeting of authorities on asteroid
impacts, that's not the film's biggest problem. He says its
portrayal of the comet's being blown to smithereens shortly before
it would have walloped the world is dead wrong. Blowing it apart so
close to Earth, he said, would instead make things worse. We would
be pummeled by comet fragments delivering the same, cumulative
amount of destructive energy as the whole thing. Every living thing
would be incinerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere on Earth would have been like the inside of a hot
oven'' Chapman said, and yet nuking the comet to pieces is supposed
to have saved the planet. ``To me, that's the biggest error in
`Deep Impact.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it could have been a lot worse. Many things were changed
as a result of the filmmakers' consultation with specialists.
Carolyn Shoemaker wryly commented recently that at least they took
out a scene that included a nude astronomer: ``I always thought
astronomy was one of the coldest professions, and envisioned
frostbite at the least!''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even as the films frequently skirted and even
flouted the laws of Nature, they helped in a visually powerful way
to get across to the public what deeply troubles astronomers and
other scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, maybe in a million years, maybe in a week, the
people of Earth will face a real doomsday scenario: A real comet or
an asteroid will be detected on a collision course with our planet.
</P>
<P>
   A mere handful of astronomers is trying to hunt down and monitor
all the objects in space that have the potential to strike Earth,
but they are operating on a fraction of the budget that the makers
of ``Deep Impact'' and ``Armageddon'' had to work with.
</P>
<P>
   A major search program called Spaceguard, advocated by a NASA
study, never came to pass, and the only search of the Southern
Hemisphere's skies was cancelled recently for lack of money. Even
the most ambitious search effort anyone has ever proposed, which
would find virtually all of the potential threats within a decade,
would cost far less than either of the impact movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week's gross from `Deep Impact' would be enough to
implement the Spaceguard Survey,'' Morrison noted wistfully. That
gross was $41.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that film may ultimately make a difference, he said. ``It
may do more to alert the public to the impact hazard than anything
in the past. And its images may even keep you up at night wondering
if we are doing enough to protect our planet against this threat.''

HMO BATTLE HEATING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A nasty fight over the business practices of health maintenance
organizations, a big part of the scene around Washington for
months, is going national, demonstrating that while it is
definitely nasty, it is also very important.
</P>
<P>
   As Exhibit A, the wide-open campaign to succeed Representative
Joe Kennedy in Massachusetts' 8th Congressional District more than
qualifies, as witness an effort by the state's powerful HMO lobby
to muscle one of businessman Chris Gabrieli's TV ads off the air.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the classically dumb move failed. Showing commendable
focus for a rookie pol, Gabrieli not only didn't pull his ad, he
made a show of putting a new, tougher one up; but the politics of
this incident is just the tip of a much more interesting iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Down in Washington, the power of the topic of HMOs has been
amply demonstrated _ most recently by the decision of Newt
Gingrich's Republican leadership to join the movement to reform the
cost-shaving behemoths by offering an outline of what it is
prepared to support in the way of codified patients' and doctors'
rights. You can knock Gingrich for only going so far, or you can
agree with him; but the important point is that the GOP move
validates the reform push and provides a solid basis for bipartisan
legislating.
</P>
<P>
   In the HMO and insurance business, the reponse was almost
immediate _ a quick round of attack ads (initially targeted at the
home districts of ranking Republicans on health care issues) and
the prospect of much more. Borrowing strategy from the tobacco
racket's successful changing of the subject last month (from health
to taxes and big government), the HMOs' marketers took the victim
route, portraying the business as a pinata that politicians were
swinging away at. Unable to refute the ocean of evidence about
profit-driven denials of care and restrictions on physicians, the
industry has resorted to cynically claiming that this is all just
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Up in Boston in late June, Gabrieli's campaign aligned him with
the HMO reformers on TV, following earlier New Democrat
communications on education. For 30 seconds his opposition was
registered to all forms of restrictions on what doctors in a plan
can tell their patients (generically known as gag rules), as was
his support for the making of medical decisions solely by doctors
as opposed to those evil accountants.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly rough stuff, but it produced a diatribe from the state
lobby _ the Massachusetts Association of HMOs _ in the form of a
letter pushing him to pull the add, with copies to the three
Boston-area network affiliates. The letter focused narrowly on a
denial that any plan literally prevents a doctor from disclosing
treatment options or other information to a patient, noting there
are no such plans in the state, and that the association supported
a state law two years ago that prohibits them.
</P>
<P>
   This is a classic, nondenial denial. As Gabrieli noted in his
reponse, most HMOs have been found to use a number of techniques to
keep providers in line. Some use contracts that bind them to
pledges not to say anything to patients that could undermine
confidence in the health plan, a nice, open-ended sword to hold
over someone's head; others can drop physicians and others from the
all-important provider list without providing a reason.
</P>
<P>
   When we talked, Gabrieli emphasized the much broader context of
his views on health care _ as businessman, think tank chairman (the
relentlessly innovative MassINC), and now as congressional
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He believes in universal insurance coverage, though
realistically via incremental change and with a mixture of private
and public organizations. He favors maintaining the
employment-based nature of health insurance, but favors more
choices for participating workers, citing the federal employees'
much-praised system from which all members of Congress benefit. And
he thinks the government should help consumers by developing
standards for quality care and putting out information about the
quality of individual health plans.
</P>
<P>
   In short, because Gabrieli is committed to an open system that
is based on choice, he is strongly committed to the ``thoughtful
regulation'' of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   There will be those who grumble and more about Gabrieli's wealth
and his TV ads, but recent history shows that money is only a
handicap for the vapid and/or the negative.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrieli's real challenge as a candidate who didn't come up in
the system is to get his ideas from the TV set to the kitchen
table, in terms directly relevant to the working families in his
very urban district.
</P>
<P>
   The state's foolish, overbearing HMOs have given him a rare
chance not available to the other candidates, and he has taken
skillful advantage of it so far.

THE REGION WHERE OUTER WORLD MEETS INNER DESIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN CLEGG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE SOUL OF SEX 
Cultivating Life as an Act of Love 
By Thomas Moore. HarperCollins. 307 pp. $25. 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Part monk, part psycho-therapist, part Pan, writer Thomas
Moore sets himself the task of reconciling the coarseness of
American culture with the resurgence of spirit. In his eighth book,
``The Soul of Sex,'' he plumbs the duality of body and soul, the
divide between the external world with its ``relentless pace of
time'' and the internal world of sweet desire.
</P>
<P>
   The soul has its own ambit, he believes, its sly life and its
undeniable will. In a season when the myth of Venus has been
preempted by images of that pouting cipher, Monica Lewinsky,
Moore's analysis is as welcome as a cool breeze in an overheated
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``By looking at the sexual myths we live out, and at our
spiritual attitudes,'' Moore writes at the outset of the book, ``we
will find the roots of our desires and the sources of our
satisfactions.''
</P>
<P>
   A monk for 12 years and a student of post-Jungian psychologist
James Hillman, Moore, author of the best-selling ``Care of the
Soul,'' seems perfectly poised to write about the ghosts, myths,
visions, body parts, and profane rituals that inhabit our sexual
imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   He begins from the premise that modern life is saturated with
sex. Why add to the groaning heap of literature, then? To answer,
he turns to Freud. ``He enunciated a principle I find useful: we
display outrageously and obsessively that which we do not fully
possess or have deeply at our disposal.'' In other words, the flags
of sexual liberation fly high because we have not found its heart,
or ours. Like gourmands addicted to junk food, Moore writes, we are
settling for quantity when what we want is small and real. The
potent god Eros has been debased and stripped of his allure, Moore
believes, cast out of heaven into the grimy realm of Internet sex
chats and newsstands with cellophane-wrapped magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hillman, Moore searches for mythical archetypes that have
deep symbolism. (In fact, Moore edited ``A Blue Fire,'' a book of
Hillman's writings published in 1989.) Moore also draws from Greek
and Roman myth, though his writing lacks the edge-walking thrill of
Hillman's. Moore draws from the American novel, film, and poetry,
as well: His parade of sexual archetypes includes figures like
Hester Prynne, Marilyn Monroe, and Old Coyote Woman.
</P>
<P>
   He strives for nothing less than a new ethic, one that blends
soul and spirit and pries loose the grip of prudish moralism. Moore
traces a pathway to tolerance. ``As we enter more deeply into the
soul of sex, we may be called upon to expand our ideas about what
sexuality is, allowing it to stand somewhat outside the range of
will and intention, allowing each other our private sexual
developments, all the while knowing that they are relevant to the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy is a core ingredient for sexual freedom, and if Moore
had a political bent, he might have expanded his analysis to probe
individuality, rights, and responsibilities as they play out in a
social context. Instead, he retreats to myth, although his
metaphors are certainly powerful and the conclusion readily
available: Love and soul and spirit flourish in rooms of their own.
</P>
<P>
   As for sex itself, it is a ritual that demands the attentions,
ablutions, and adornments of a high priest. And as such, it can
deepen an individual encounter with the world. ``Giving ourselves
plenty of time, preparing a place, adorning our bodies, and
creating a spiritual milieu, an arena bigger than ourselves and our
`relationship,' might pull off the veils that have shrouded sex in
the shadows of biology and psychology during the recent modern
period. We can restore the mystery grasped so palpably by our
ancestors who built temples to eros in realization of our absolute
and unforgiving need for enchantment.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore is less adept at dealing with the shadow side of sex. He
would have us believe that those lined up at ``adult'' magazine and
video racks are redeemed by their act of contemplation. Can the
sexual gaze ever come to rest without bringing distortions of
power? Does society's skittishness about pornography stem merely
from a history of prudishness? What about child pornography? Rape
fantasies? Moore never effectively dispatches these questions, and
skirts the intersection of pornography and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Although he notes that ``feminists have rightly complained about
the humiliation involved in the pornographic gaze,'' Moore implies
that it is because of a lack of expansiveness. ``It is not a
question of one being good and the other evil. Because of the
narrowness of our current vision, all we have of sexual imagery is
Persephone's dark side, the kind lacking altogether in innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   His solution? Limits born of tolerance and worn gently. And
recognition that the soul of sex takes on many guises, including
celibacy. Only a former monk could have the audacity to riff on
Jesus in a book about sex. Moore echoes the biblical command to
choose life, and suggests that limits allow the spirit to thrive.
Those limits should come not from convention and fear but from a
warm embrace, from the soul in sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of Jesus suggests a way of placing limits that
derives from joy and pleasure rather than fear and anxiety, limits
determined by a positive choice in life. Jesus seems to choose
joyful celibacy and then to tolerate the struggles of others to
establish their ways of being sexual and their ways of finding
limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore calls for a return to the philosophy of Epicurus:
deepening simple intimacy and pleasure by honoring desire. Snapping
the leash will take courage, he implies, but it will allow us to
get on with the business of life.

 &HT;    ShortTakes: My Tribute to Roy Rogers
 &HT;    (Column for Tuesday, July 13, but please use at will.)
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld

   I wasn't a Gene Autry kind of kid. I wasn't a John Wayne kind of
kid. I wasn't a Lash Larue kind of kid. Who I liked was Roy Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't like the singing, the girls, the barn dances, the dude
ranches. I liked the clothes. Roy Rogers was some kind of dresser,
white hat, wonderful fringed shirts, boots, gleaming guns. You
can't say Roy Rogers wasn't like anyone else. He was like everyone
else, only better.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Rogers didn't live in the Old West. A real cowboy would have
giggled. There were hints of cowboy things going on, but what Roy
mostly did was catch sidewinders and save dumb girls from back
East. That was all right if they didn't get close and were good
sports. Roy's West was modern and old, a world of horses and
boulders and cars and telephones. No matter. I spent lots of time
explaining why Roy Rogers was better than Gene Autry. Now I can't
remember why.
</P>
<P>
   Circa 1940, my local paper published a color picture of Roy
Rogers dressed to kill on the front of its rotogravure section. I
had a brilliant idea. I cut Roy out and tied a string to the top of
his hat. I passed the string through a keyhole, then ran to the
other side of the door, and started yanking the string. I imagined
Roy was doing all kinds of great things. I kept it up all day. My
mother never noticed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST MADISON, Maine _ Like any camper pining for the comforts of
home, Californian J.D. Beltran began her summer in the country by
personalizing her space. She painted her studio walls electric
blue, then built herself a keyboard stand and bookcase in the
woodworking shop down the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran took her assigned job _ replenishing the campus's peanut
butter and jelly supply _ seriously, too. That and the mandate to
mingle as furiously as possible with the other 64 campers, most of
whom did not, unlike Beltran, leave a spouse behind when they left
their lofts in SoHo and Paris to spend nine weeks in rural Maine,
at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the immersion-exhaustion method,'' says Beltran, 38,
taking lunch in the lakeside dining hall while gazing out on the
peaceful waters of Lake Wesserunsett, a bit more than a week into
the season. ``There's a ton of socializing at first. It's good they
don't expect you to get much work done, because I've been averaging
four hours of sleep a night.''
</P>
<P>
   With no phones or televisions in the dorms, Beltran says, what
feels confining at first becomes liberating. Friends don't expect
you to return calls. Laundry gets ignored. Pick-up soccer games and
browsing in the library take the place of household chores.
</P>
<P>
   Says San Francisco painter Jennifer Mattson, who would otherwise
be working in an office this summer, ``It's rare to find a
community like this in the real world. Everyone here feels
displaced. No one worries about paying the rent or feeding the
cat.''
</P>
<P>
   In a region where summer colonies come in all shapes, sizes, and
flavors, from seaside writers' enclaves to woodsy religious orders,
Skowhegan is indeed a rare species: an established colony whose
membership changes every year.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1946 by a quartet of World War II veterans who
envisioned a seasonal think-tank run for artists by other artists,
and whose vision took shape on the grounds of a funky old Maine
chicken farm, the school, named after the nearby lumber town, has
survived fire, faddishness, in-fighting, and fiscal uncertainty to
claim a seat at the art world's head picnic table. Skowhegan, just
northwest of Waterville off Interstate 95, is the
anti-Provincetown: remote, unglitzy, devoid of galleries or
tourists. Yet in some circles of commerce, Skowhegan carries as
much name value as Sotheby's. Maybe more.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Alumni of the school include superstars Alex Katz,
Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Indiana, and Nancy Graves. Jack Levine and
Louise Nevelson taught here. So, in one fashion or another, have
Ben Shahn, Roy Lichtenstein, Frank Stella, Buckminster Fuller, Red
Grooms, Alice Neel, Claes Oldenburg, and Nan Goldin. Janine Antoni,
a resident faculty member this year, won a MacArthur grant last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding one's hubby goodbye for two months is a small price to
pay _ on top of the school's $5,200 tuition _ for a shot at joining
such an exclusive fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about that. For about five minutes,'' Beltran, a
painter and video artist, says with a laugh. ``This is Skowhegan,
after all. An opportunity like this doesn't come along too often.
</P>
<P>
   For artists seeking admission to Skowhegan, as nearly 800 did
this year, portfolio counts for everything. Candidates are judged
on the originality of their work, not their college grades or
personalities. There are no preadmission interviews. Theoretically,
the class could be composed entirely of recluses and sociopaths. In
reality, the school almost forces artists out of their shells and
into a group dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Boroson, a student in 1989 who returned this summer as a
staff assistant, remembers locking himself in his sculpture studio
for the first two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that,'' Boroson says, ``I was basically told to get out
of there and have some fun. Which I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun aside, those accepted to the program look to jump-start
their careers by exposing themselves to fresh ideas, new
surroundings, and rigorous critiques from established artists like
Antoni. The average age of this year's group is 28, with slightly
more men (36) than women (29) in residence. The typical resume
includes attendance at a top-flight arts school. The class of 1998
also continues a long tradition of multiculturalism at Skowhegan,
with a dozen countries and more than two dozen nationalities
represented.
</P>
<P>
   While a good deal of the colony's value rests in its built-in
impermanence, continuity and tradition are also important. The
300-acre campus looks much as it did in the 1950s and '60s, for
instance, with a smattering of new shed-style studios added over
the past decade. Cows and sheep still graze in the fields. At dusk,
loons call across the lake. The surrounding woods yield relics of
summers past: a dilapidated Picasso-esque treehouse; a
rubber-covered ``toadstool'' inspired by Lewis Carroll, perhaps.
Bits of magical realism hidden amid the moose tracks and
mosquitoes. Visitors, while not prohibited, aren't encouraged
either.
</P>
<P>
   Bernarda Shahn, a renowned artist and Ben Shahn's widow, has
maintained a summer home here since 1966. Now 95, she paints in her
studio every day, and until her late 80s seldom missed a Saturday
night barn dance or a visiting lecture. Styles come and go, Shahn
reflects, but the school's ``deliberately noninstitutional''
orientation helps preserve its purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Says Shahn, ``Skowhegan is entirely different from any other art
school, where over time the students tend to become secondary.
Here, the students make the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the students, Shahn recalls, have been an 11-year old boy,
an artist who painted clumps of dirt, and a Swedish woman (actually
a faculty member) who decorated her body and swam across the lake,
nude, in a performance piece that startled unsuspecting sunbathers
on the far shore.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's group included a video artist who drove a car in a
local demolition derby and another who constructed a float for the &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Presque Isle Potato Festival parade. A third stole into downtown
Skowhegan one night and installed a highly unauthorized mural of
the Mike Tyson-Evander Holyfield fight (infamous for its ear-biting
episode) on a vacant storefront. The police called co-director Tom
Finkelpearl, who moved swiftly to have the offending mural removed.
</P>
<P>
   The artist ``was mad at me, but he got over it,'' says
Finkelpearl. ``Maintaining good community relations is important to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Student'' is actually a misnomer, Finkelpearl adds, since
apart from classes in fresco painting, Skowhegan offers no formal
instruction in anything. Attendees need not produce a coherent body
of work, either. Or any work at all, if they choose. Talking about
making art _ or not making art _ is as valuable as what takes place
in the studio, Finkelpearl suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do your work back in LA,'' he says. ``But you cannot
get this type of intensity anywhere else. By the end of the term,
though, people are really into what they're doing. You walk by the
studios at 2 in the morning and lights are blazing everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkelpearl, in his second full year at Skowhegan, is a low-key
CEO who pedals a mountain bike around campus wearing a Red Sox cap.
He seldom misses one of the three communal meals served daily (the
food, by the way, is excellent) and solicits constant feedback from
the group. One minute Finkelpearl is lending advice on where to buy
a keg for a weekend party. The next he's leading a discussion on
contemporary theory or public funding of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my jobs is to say yes to every artistic request,'' he
says, ``provided it's not setting fire to a dorm or something like
that. Fortunately, I don't have to do any fund-raising. We have a
New York office and a well-heeled board of trustees'' chaired by
Boston arts maven Ann Gund _ ``to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Skowhegan has seen hard times as well as good ones. In 1960,
fire gutted the original fresco barn, destroying dozens of works
and the school library. A proposal to open a Skowhegan West, in
California, was shot down. Finkelpearl says the school failed to
open one year, although he cannot remember when. Shahn recalls
``ferocious fights'' among the trustees, who help underwrite the
school's $1 million operating budget, and board of governors, a
group of artists that determines each year's participants and sets
what passes for the school's academic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Artists being artists, egotism and eccentricity are to be
expected _ even celebrated _ in a community like Skowhegan. Shahn
nevertheless credits Finkelpearl's predecessor, Barbara Lapcek, for
providing strong leadership when it was needed. In the '80s, says
Shahn, Lapcek helped neutralize a radical gay element that had some
wondering if the school would be shut down. In other years sexual
repression and racism have been the controversies.
</P>
<P>
   Says Finkelpearl, ``It feels like a new era here. The last of
the founders'' _ sculptor Sidney Simon _ ``died last year. The
current staff was not even born when the school was established.
Thanks to a booming economy, we're reasonably flush. A new era
means new opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   For Rikki Wemega-Kwawu, 39, a painter from Ghana, Skowhegan
brought the opportunity to visit his first Western country. So far,
he says, ``it's been a wonderful interaction, like being in
paradise. We leave our doors unlocked 24 hours a day. I find this
very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   His only reservation, says Wemega-Kwawu, is walking to and from
his studio after dark. ``I don't like to because of the wildlife. I
do not know what is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He peers cautiously out the screen door of his hillside studio,
which is bathed in rich morning light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you tell me,'' Wemega-Kwawu asks, ``are there bears around
here?''

ALEXIE SENDS `SMOKE SIGNALS' 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SAUNDERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH _ Sitting in a stylishly sterile hotel cafe in this
tropical playpen, surrounded by bored tourists whose day in
paradise was just spat upon by a window-rattling thunderstorm,
Sherman Alexie is about as far away from home as he could get
without needing a passport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty wild place,'' deadpans Alexie, a tall man
with thick glasses and a searchlight grin who has seen no end of
wild places in the last six months. Author Alexie is a Native
American, of Spokane/Coeur d'Alene descent, whose film ``Smoke
Signals'' is the first feature-length film written, directed, and
co-produced by American Indians. It was a critical favorite at the
Sundance Film Festival and charmed audiences at the Nantucket Film
Festival, so lately Alexie has been a frequent flyer, usually far
from his Seattle home.
</P>
<P>
   As it begins its slow national rollout (opening Friday, July 3,
in several cities), ``Smoke Signals'' has been tagged as a prime
indie alternative to the usual summer slate of blockbusters. No
meteors follow the film's two main characters on their poignant
journey from Idaho to Arizona, and no lizards of any size prowl the
arid trailer park where Victor Joseph and his friend Thomas
Builds-the-Fire go to retrieve Joseph's father's ashes.
</P>
<P>
   In an animated interview over lunch recently, Alexie suggested
that ``Smoke Signals'' flows counter to the current Hollywood trend
not because it is so new, but because it is like so many other
movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old-fashioned story. And I think that's just what's
been really appealing to people. They want a movie with a
beginning, middle, and an end,'' Alexie said, adding slyly, ``I
think we're tired of movies about good-looking white guys shooting
each other while saying clever things.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Off the reservation
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As ``Smoke Signals'' seeks to prove with its on-the-road scenes
of personal epiphanies, revelations can happen in the strangest
places. And like his characters, Alexie has traveled a long way
from the ``rez'' (the reservation) both physically and mentally.
That was made clearer than desert sky at the Nantucket Film
Festival. It was there, Alexie said, that he discovered the highly
autobiographical story's ability to touch an audience he never
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there would be a certain part of the audience that
would see it as quaint and think, `Oh how cute, Indians.' But in
the lobby after the screening, I was shaking hands with people and
this woman _ upper-class, Polo-wearing white woman, 50-something _
was crying. She came over to me and said, `That was a beautiful
movie. I haven't talked to my father in 12 years, and I'm going to
talk to him right now.' She walked over to the pay phone in the
lobby, dialed, and as I was standing there about 10 feet away, she
starts talking to her dad,'' Alexie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing just tore me apart in a lot of ways. It broke
apart all the stereotypes I had about a well-kept, 50-something
woman in Nantucket, the idea that their lives are perfect. My
provincial thought was obviously proven wrong at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the film, Alexie prods the audience into examining
the flip side of prevailing ways in which Indians are misperceived.
In one wry, incisive moment, Thomas, the nerdy raconteur/con
artist, practices being more classicly stone-faced and inscrutable
in his story delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Four stories from Alexie's collection ``The Lone Ranger and
Tonto Fistfight in Heaven'' are at the heart of ``Smoke Signals.''
Possibly because it was pieced together from related but discrete
parts, the film often seems like a portrait drawn with deliberate
small strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie said he took pains not to allow the audience to fall into
the same ``Dances With Wolves'' syndrome lampooned in dialogue
between the hunky Victor and oddball Thomas, whose pairing is more
Felix-and-Oscar than Quixote-and-Sancho Panza. For the most part,
Alexie got what he wanted: altered expectations of both Indians and
of the way that most Americans see them, through the smudged lenses
of Hollywood. Alexie weaves enough false conjuring and overt cliche
about Indians into the story to leave mental cul-de-sacs for the
unwary. Still, several early reviews have proved that there's still
a long way to go before perceptions catch up to reality.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Thomas, a classic trickster who begs not to be taken
seriously. ``He comes from a long history of not only indigenous
trickster figures, but Western civilization figures,'' Alexie said.
``When he's telling his stories, they're so used to seeing a stoic
Indian storyteller standing up on a mountain that I'm not sure that
they're even listening to him. He's lying, telling jokes, making
fun of people, manipulating them. Certain people have missed the
point that he's really an unreliable narrator, telling lies and the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ironic thing is that these people prove our point, by
buying into the whole national consciousness about the way Indians
should be. Indians can be just as full of (expletive) as anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Life, art, and all that
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As he washed down fragrant soba noodles with a cola, Alexie
explained that there is much of his life woven into the film.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up on the Spokane Indian reservation northwest of
Spokane, Wash., a river city near the Idaho state line. He was a
drinker, as were members of his family, and elements of the
indelible pain of alcoholism crystallized within his writing.
Alexie, 31, has penned eight volumes of poetry of varying length,
two novels, and the aforementioned short story collection, a body
of work that prompted Granta magazine in 1996 to select him as one
of the top 20 young American novelists.

biased, and discourages complaints by refusing to release any

Police Chief Beverly Harvard's responses were ``oblique.'' The

work -- so that his people can also resume their jobs here. As a
result of the GM strike in the United States, most of the 2,500 GM
workers at a plant in Silao have been idled with only 50 percent
pay. Auto parts from the United States are no longer coming into
Mexico, and unfinished trucks are stacking up outside a sprawling
six-year-old factory here. Mexican workers, who are paid about $12
a day or less, are starting to get worried. Thousands of other
Mexicans who work for GM-owned Delphi auto parts plants scattered
across northern Mexico have also been idled with partial pay.
Striking American workers fear that GM wants to move even more
aggressively into Mexico, where labor is much cheaper. Analysts say
they're right. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

 MIAMI BEACH: ... American novelists.  
 
<TEXT>

   ``Smoke Signals'' is based on a trip Alexie took with a friend
to get his father, except that in the course of writing, Alexie
substituted his own family for his friend's. ``That story is not
mine to tell,'' he said, cryptically, deflecting any further
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Joseph, the outgoing, tragic, force-of-nature father of
Victor, is ``a lot like my father, sort of an exaggerated cinematic
version,'' Alexie said. ``My father is at home, very much alive,
unlike Arnold.'' And unlike the lingering bitterness that haunts
Victor along his journey, Alexie said, ``My relationship with my
father has progressed to the point where I can say `I love you' and
`I'm mad at you' in the same sentence. I'd say that's a sign of
health.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie's writing built bridges between himself and his father
despite causing some tension early in his career. ``At the
beginning, my family was really uncomfortable with my writing
because I was dealing so heavily with autobiographical material,
about our various dysfunctions and domestic riots, and also about
our intimate and tender moments.''
</P>
<P>
   That changed with the acclaim for his poetry (``The Business of
Fancydancing,'' published in 1992 and selected as a Notable Book of
the Year by The New York Times), his short story collection (a
citation winner for the 1994 PEN/Hemingway Award for First Best
Fiction), and his first novel, ``Reservation Blues,'' published in
1995. His family eventually realized that the attention Alexie's
work was bringing to Indian life would allow more people to
understand and connect with Indians ``on the rez and off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They liked the fact that so many people were identifying with
it. We didn't feel alone in our problems. We grew up in a
reservation. It's a tiny little community, so the idea of a
worldview is a luxury. My parents were worried about putting food
in the fridge. That was the daily struggle, feeding their kids.
They've seen that the stories help other people survive.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A new wave?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alexie's latest novel, ``Indian Killer,'' a dark tale about a
serial killer, is being developed as a feature film that Alexie
plans to direct beginning this fall. If ``Smoke Signals'' succeeds
in the meantime, it could set off a wave of young Native American
filmmakers and writers, in the way that Spike Lee and Robert
Rodriguez motivated African-Americans and Latinos to get behind the
camera (and money people to invest in them). It's likely that some
may be like Alexie, a lifelong film buff who planned to watch
movies from a reasonable seat-to-screen distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother and I would hitchhike from the reservation to
Spokane, about 45 miles, to sneak into movies. We'd go to drive-ins
and spend the whole evening dodging the employees, hiding in front
of cars, underneath cars. We were two cute little Indian kids, so
some people would invite us into their cars. We'd be sitting with
some strange white family watching movies, or we'd sit by one of
the speaker stands, in the dirt,'' Alexie said, putting down a
forkful of noodles and vegetables. ``Before I was married, before I
had a kid, I would wake up on a Saturday morning, get out the
newspaper, and circle the movies I wanted to see. I knew Spokane
well enough to drive from place to place to see four or five movies
in a day. I would see Jean-Claude Van Damme movies, art films _
everything. Then I would wake up the next morning and do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   He never intended to write for films, or to be a writer of any
kind. He wanted to be a pediatrician. Childhood illness, as it has
many others, left him with an enduring fascination with doctors and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born hydrocephalic, so I had brain surgery when I was 6
months old and was really sick after that,'' Alexie said. ``I had
seizures, was medicated and essentially bedridden for most of the
first seven years of my life. You spend a lot of time in bed and
you think a lot. I imagined whole worlds, imaginary tribes around
me and whole lives for myself. That's really where the storytelling
started.''
</P>
<P>
   His fluidity with language helped him get a scholarship to
Washington State University _ but no tale, however mystical or
grand, was a talisman for what he would find in human anatomy
class. ``I kept fainting. I couldn't handle the smell of the
cadavers. It's not really a good bedside manner to fall into your
patients during surgery,'' Alexie laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a class to fill his schedule and in danger of losing his
scholarship, he found the only match for the open slot in his
schedule: a poetry-writing workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a few classes, Alex Kuo, the professor, came up to me
and gave me an anthology of contemporary American Indian poetry. It
was a revelation. All this very specific cultural stuff that I'd
never seen written down. Then I read a line of poetry by a Piyute
Indian poet, Adrian Louis _ `I'm in the reservation of my mind' _
and for me it was like reading for the first time `Because I could
not stop for death, death kindly stopped for me' or `I sing the
body electric.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that I wanted to write, that I would spend my whole
life writing. No matter what else I had to do to make a living, I
would write. People talk about those moments happening _ I don't
think it happens much. It's more gradual, all of a sudden they wake
up and realize, `I love what I'm doing.' But for me it was a
sledgehammer to the heart.''

FROM ROGERS, NATION'S YOUNG LEARNED TO SHOOT STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1990, driving from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, I
stopped with Dylan, my son, in Victorville, a nondescript des-ert
town in California, to see the Roy Rogers Museum, where Trigger,
the Wonder Horse, was stuffed and on display.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan didn't understand why I wanted to stop at a museum
dedicated to a guy who'd made his name selling fried chicken. I
explained to him that there was more to Roy Rogers than a
multimillion-dollar fast-food restaurant chain. When I was his age,
Roy Rogers was not only the King of the Cowboys, he was the king of
television.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the museum, under glass, were hundreds of items from Roy
Rogers's 87 motion pictures and seven-year television career. Most
of the relics would be insignificant to anyone who didn't spend
every Saturday morning in the early to mid-'50s in front of the
television set wearing a cowboy hat, a checkered shirt, a pair of
Fanner-50 cap pistols, and, if they were very lucky, boots with
spurs.
</P>
<P>
   In the days when television was literally and figuratively in
black and white and the available stations didn't hit double
figures, Roy Rogers was a touchstone for the nation's kids.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, Rogers, along with his wife, Dale Evans, and
sidekick, Pat Brady, made the world safer by capturing the bad
guys. And they did it without killing. The guns, when they did come
out, disarmed the villains. In the years the show ran _ from 1951
to 1957 _ not one drop of blood was ever spilled.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, a lot of the shows seem corny, simple-minded.
It's no wonder that, even given the plethora of cable outlets and
nostalgic television, ``The Roy Rogers Show'' is not in
syndication.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the narrator of one of his sagebrush colleagues used to
say, ``return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear''
because, in his time, Rogers may have influenced more children than
Dr. Spock.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike so many of today's so-called role models, Rogers stood
for something. He believed in doing the right thing. He believed in
standing up for the downtrodden and earning respect through
heroism. He believed in hard work and in an America where everyone
got a fair shot, because Rogers was a straight shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a boy, our parents taught us that hitting below the
belt was a cowardly thing,'' he once said. ``I don't believe this
kind of thing is `entertainment,' no matter how you look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers's philosophy seems quaint and naive in a era filled with
the hip, nasty cynicism of TV's ``South Park,'' where hitting below
the belt is the least of it. But Rogers gave those of us who used
to be kids a sense of ethics and obligation that seems so
unprofitable nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't stay long at the museum. Dylan was in a hurry because
he wanted to get to the set of his favorite show, ``Twin Peaks.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his family, Roy Rogers leaves millions of fans
whose lives were enriched by his. Happy trails to you, Roy. Until
we meet again.

THE MAN BEHIND THE OZZFEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine asking this question 25 years ago: Will Ozzy Osbourne
and/or his band Black Sabbath be alive _ to say nothing of working,
to say nothing of being idolized _ as the millennium beckons? Many
would have laughed it off. One of those would have been Osbourne.
``Believe me,'' says Osbourne, ``we did a good job of trying to
kill ourselves on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said to me, `Do you consider yourself a lucky guy?' I
said `I'm a hell of a lucky guy.' If my life was to end right now,
it's been one hell of a journey.''
</P>
<P>
   There's been lots of sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll _ and lots of
money made. The working-class son of a northern England family
lives in a sunny land and inhabits a tasteful manse.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy metal itself _ Osbourne's metier, a form of guitar-stoked,
oft-angry music that can be simultaneously reactionary and radical
_ has been pronounced dead ``ever since our first album,'' Osbourne
says. ``I'm here to tell you that it ain't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozzy Osbourne is the Iron Man, the godfather of heavy metal, the
now-sober icon to whom all young metal-ites turn for inspiration
and insight. And they're not the only ones seeking words of wisdom
from the 49-year-old singer-songwriter, the once and future leader
of Black Sabbath, the man whose name and legend sit atop the
multi-band bash that is Ozzfest '98, a cavalcade that comes to
Great Woods Tuesday and Thursday. Why, The New York Times
magazine &UR;  &LR; recently picked his brain for thoughts about guns and
rock. (Guns kill, rock rocks, said Osbourne, essentially, spiking
his thoughts with, as always, a few expletives the paper had to
delete.)
</P>
<P>
   All this respect going toward a man mainstream America once knew
as the crazy guy who bit into a live dove at a meeting with his
record company (he was drunk) and bit into a dead bat onstage (he
thought it was rubber).
</P>
<P>
   Ask someone who is part of the new metal breed about Osbourne.
Limp Bizkit singer Fred Durst says: ``I used to listen to him
nonstop back in the day. I used to listen to him back when I didn't
even know what a band was. He's a living legend. I can't believe he
called me up to be on the Ozzfest.''
</P>
<P>
   Sevendust's drummer Morgan Rose: ``In my wildest dreams, I never
thought I'd play the same stage as Ozzy Osbourne. Ozzy did say to
me, though, `You never want to be a ... legend.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are those among the young who believe Osbourne's lost some
of the old fire _ that he's become pop-oriented and cuddly over
time _ but no one will spit at his early days with Sabbath (``War
Pigs,'' ``Iron Man,'' ``Paranoid,'' ``Fairies Wear Boots'') or
dance on his grave now. There is no grave. Literally or
figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   Osbourne says he's working now to beat what he calls his last
addiction, tobacco. He's been on the patch. ``Toughest thing I've
ever had to do kick in my life,'' he growls. ``Worse than smack,
cocaine, crack, anything. I'm not all clear yet. It's too easy for
me to go out and buy a pack of cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Surprise hit
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first proper Ozzfest was last year, and it was the surprise
hit of the summer, averaging a higher ticket gross than any
multi-band tour, including Lilith Fair (which, for the entire tour,
had the highest gross). Ozzfest '98 should match its predecessor.
But it will be an endurance test for the fans. Two stages, 100 to
120 decibels of bone-crushing rock on a constant basis in summer
heat. On the main stage: Osbourne, Tool, Megadeth, Limp Bizkit,
Soulfly, Sevendust, and Coal Chamber. On the pit stage: Motorhead,
the Melvins, Life of Agony, System of a Down, Incubus, Monster
Voodoo Machine, the Snots, Kilgore, and Ultraspank.
</P>
<P>
   There are melody makers and there are melody shredders. Fast
thrashers and slow dirge-mongers. Angst-meisters and
party-heartiers. Grizzled old geezers and Young Turks. There will
be a bit of hard-edged, hip-hop-influenced metal and a bit of
art-rock metal. Lots of double-bass drum sets. The mosh pits should
be approached with elbowpads and kneepads. You'll hear about death
and destruction, drug addiction and exhilaration, war and peace,
Satan and his minions. You'll see one band emerge from a giant prop
toilet. Osbourne himself will have you happily singing along to
``Paranoid,'' a conspiracy theory every metalhead worth his salt
knew about before Mulder and Scully did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a few of the bands,'' says Osbourne about the tour
selections. ``Megadeth, Soulfly, Coal Chamber, Motorhead, the
Snots. What I want to do, especially on the second stage, is give
an unknown band a springboard, a band that wouldn't normally get
the opportunity to play in front of that many. I love passing the
torch to the next generation. It keeps me young at heart, in tune
with what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Osbourne, for one, isn't going to listen to the whole thing.
``Put it this way,'' he says. ``Even if it was an acoustic set _ if
you listened to one, two, three, four ... 15 bands, at the end of
the day you ain't gonna know what you listened to. But there's
variety there. It's not just music, though, it's for people who
like a carnival atmosphere, with sideshows. You can see the band
that you want, you don't have to leave the grounds, you can see
people getting tattooed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, I do care about the welfare of the people.
I have kids of my own and if they were going to a rock concert of
any magnitude, I would be devastated if they got (messed) up on the
way home.''

   Let's have a rousing cheer for Buffalo! And, yes, we do mean the
city in western New York. Oh, winters can be rough, but summers are
sunny and pleasant, and the city offers history and culture
aplenty. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _Presidents Millard Fillmore and Grover Cleveland were both from
Buffalo. Alas, another president, William McKinley, was
assassinated there in 1901, and Vice President Theodore Roosevelt
took the oath of office in Buffalo's Wilcox Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   _That mansion is now a National Historic Site. In addition, the
city has eight National Historic Landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   _The Albright-Knox art gallery features the work of Picasso, Van
Gogh, Warhol, Renoir, and many other celebrated artists.
</P>
<P>
   _Buffalo is the only city that boasts five homes designed by
master architect Frank Lloyd Wright.

NOW, DOUBT CAST ON THE LINDA TRIPP `TALKING POINTS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Steven Brill now has company.
</P>
<P>
   To last month's examination of the press's uncritical handling
of suspect material in the initial stages of Kenneth Starr's Monica
Lewinsky investigation, the names of Skip Fox and John F.X. Gillis
now need to be added as the de-constructors of one of the case's
most important, purported pieces of ``evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be the infamous ``talking points'' that Lewinsky's
manipulative, self-inflating friend, Linda Tripp, claims the former
White House intern gave her during a car ride home last Jan. 14,
and which Tripp claims to have then immediately passed on to the
independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   To that official version, thanks to Fox and Gillis, one question
now cries out for an answer and an investigiation: what talking
points?
</P>
<P>
   Fox is an English professor at the University of Southwestern
Louisiana, and Gillis is a doctoral candidate assistant. In a
serious of three, astonishingly detailed analyses available via the
Internet, they have dealt seriously with some important information
that the Scandalrama Press, competing mindlessly for anti-Clinton
morcels, has essentially ignored. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   _There are significantly different versions of these so-called
talking points, depending on which media outlet claiming possession
of them (they find at least seven) one happens to study.
</P>
<P>
   The best example is a single sentence of recommended Tripp-talk:
``You have never observed the president behaving inappropriately
with anybody.'' It is missing from two outlets' copies but is
present in five others. In addition, one version from US News's
on-line text uses paragraphs completely out of the order in which
they appear in the other versions.
</P>
<P>
   _The differences, not explainable as either typographical or
transcription error, undermine (to put it mildly) any assertion
that there was a simple transmission of a single version of a
document as an attempted subornation of perjury from Lewinsky to
Tripp and then to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   And in their textual analysis, Fox and Gillis don't just note
the widely observed changes in style and content _ from lawyer-like
to quasi-political strategy in preparation for deposition by Paula
Jones to personal asides to second- and first-person versions of
affidavit drafts. They also make a case for multiple authorship,
including by Tripp herself.
</P>
<P>
   _The content of the various versions of the talking points does
not support an assertion that Lewinsky was trying to get Tripp to
``lie'' about what she saw and heard from Kathleen Willey, the
woman who has claimed with diminishing credibility that President
Clinton virtually assaulted her four years ago. Instead, it
supports a skeptical view of Willey that Tripp has always asserted
in public comments and contains ``beliefs'' that by definition
cannot be perjurious.
</P>
<P>
   _The published versions of the material contain information that
available evidence indicates Lewinsky or even the White House could
not have known, above all that Tripp had been dealing with Paula
Jones's attorneys virtually from the moment of her subpoena in that
case on Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The best example here is an almost offhand observation in the
text, obviously for the benefit of Jones's lawyers: ``By the way,
remember how I said there was someone else that I knew about. Well
she turned out to be a huge liar ...'' The authors note that for
Lewinsky to have tried to put those words in Tripp's mouth she
would have to know that Tripp was dealing with them, for which
there is no known evidence. However, they do note that the
adjective ``huge'' is a Tripp favorite in previously published
audiotape transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   _In that one instance, a casual insertion of a gratuitous
comment more than suggests that instead of being a single document,
the talking points are more plausibly an e-mail compilation that
may have existed on more than one computer. That is especially
valid, given the comment's final, throwaway line, ``Well, at least
that gets me out of another scandal I know about.'' And from more
than one computer, more than one source could have given the
differing versions of the document to different media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   _It's also at least interesting that the only reference to
Tripp's first attorney is with his first name, Kirby (Behr), while
Clinton attorney Bob Bennett is mentioned by surname.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief reference to the Fox-Gillis work in this
week's Village Voice and, more important, a Web site
(www.ucs.usl.edu/jfg0701/essays/tripp.html).
</P>
<P>
   There are three documents there, and the reading is heavy. But
it's worth it, as well as truly disturbing about the handling in
the press of ``evidence'' that is very clearly not what it seems or
has been purported to represent. So what else is new?

<P>
   Nine days into the journey, W. Hodding Carter finds this
remarkable: He doesn't hate the boat yet.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and his nine-man crew have set sail once again on the
Snorri, a 54-foot wooden replica of a Viking ship, and are
attempting to re-create _ as authentically as possible _ the voyage
of Leif Ericsson.
</P>
<P>
   For Carter, a writer and adventurer from West Virginia and son
of former State Department spokesman Hodding Carter, the smooth
sailing so far has been a pleasure. During last year's maiden
voyage, a rudder broke while the Snorri was crossing the Davis
Strait from Greenland, and the crew was forced to abandon the
expedition. The boat was towed back to Greenland by the Canadian
Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' Carter said. ``I kept fooling myself,
saying we can keep on going. We would have probably died.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carter, who says he has ``a big stubborn streak,'' decided
almost immediately to try again.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and his crew of would-be Norsemen left Nuuk, Greenland,
on June 28 and are en route to L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland _
the one confirmed Norse settlement in North America. The Snorri's
crew hopes to complete the 1,500-mile voyage in less than three
months, crossing the Davis Strait from Greenland to Baffin Island
and then south to Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   The Snorri, which carries crew from across New England, has no
cabin so the men sleep on deck, under tarps. &UR;  &LR; Named for the first
Viking child born in the New World, the Snorri was followed out of
port by a fleet of kayaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day was a very emotional one for me,'' said Carter. ``I
even cried a little. Tough Viking, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   The Snorri crew had a few days of sunny, warm weather to begin
the voyage. But as they sailed north along Greenland's coast, the
rains came. Over the weekend, the crew put ashore in the town of
Maniitsoq to stock up on provisions and dry out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just relentless rain,'' said crew member Doug Cabot of
Somerville by telephone from Greenland. ``After a while, it gets
just a little bit dull, a little bit depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cabot is eager to get on with the journey. He was on bow
watch when the Snorri had a close encounter with a humpback whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We passed within 10 yards of it. It did a big roll out of the
water right next to us ... spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Cabot said the crew is now engaged in ``a little bit of a
waiting game to figure &UR;  &LR; where to make the crossing'' of the Davis
Strait. That decision will be based on weather and ice conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Snorri is powered by a canvas sail and wooden oars. But the
boat is outfitted with some modern navigational aides _ radios, a
compass, and hand-held global positioning system unit, as well as a
laptop computer that can connect the Snorri to the rest of the
world via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The voyage's site on the World Wide Web
(www.beyond.landsend.com) recorded about 180,000 hits in the first
week of this year's voyage. The trip is being underwritten by
Land's End, the Wisconsin mail-order retailer, and Carter plans to
write a book.
</P>
<P>
   During last year's voyage, Carter remembers hating the Snorri,
hating the cold that made him think about chopping his hands off,
and questioning the whole idea of the voyage.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter has fallen back in love with the Maine-built Snorri,
whose rudder, as well as the crew's spirit, has been shored up.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are guys that are trying to pretend to be Vikings,''
Carter said of his crew. ``They don't know what a second thought
is. ... Last year we went into this last summer with our typical
sort of American impatience, and, as a group, we left it with a lot
more patience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Snorri crew has 100 miles behind it and 1,400 ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right on schedule, because we really have no schedule,''
Carter wrote. He said his crew was ``psyched. More positive than
last year even, and happy to be together again. No one has gotten
too stinky yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And, at this point in the journey, Carter still loves his boat.
``I think,'' he said, ``it has something to do with the Viking
clothes.'' &UR;  &LR;

MOTORHEAD: LEMMY AND TWO OR THREE GUYS WHO AREN'T LEMMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You don't see a lot of Ozzy,'' says Motorhead bassist-singer
Lemmy about what he expects to see backstage and out front at
Ozzfest. ``He just does what he does all day and comes down.''
</P>
<P>
   If Osbourne's the king of this tribe, is Lemmy, who has toured
before with Osbourne's Blizzard of Ozz, the dark prince?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he scoffs. ``I'm the jester, just the jester.'' Another
expat Brit living in LA, Lemmy used to play in the space-rock band
Hawkwind and formed Motorhead when he was kicked out _ as he was
from every other group he'd ever been in. After writing ``Kings of
Speed'' for Hawkwind, he was busted at the Canadian border for
possessing _ get ready _ speed. He formed Motorhead, a
razor-voiced, hot-rails-to-hell punk-metal machine, in part so he
wouldn't get kicked out again. He's been at this music thing for 34
years. Motorhead _ once best described as Lemmy and two or three
guys who aren't Lemmy _ are touring behind ``Snake Bite Love.''
Classic songs include ``Ace of Spades,'' ``1916,'' and ``Killed by
Death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The main secret of surviving,'' says Lemmy, ``is not stopping,
right? It's just what I want to do. I don't want to do nothing else
and I don't want to stop doing it, 'cause I'm enjoying it. Also, my
facial presentation doesn't lend itself to a lot of other jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmy and Motorhead are so well loved in the metal world, even
if they're a fringe band for many fans, that three years ago the
four guys in Metallica all dressed up as Lemmy (``bullet belts,
black shirts and trousers, shades and wigs on _ they looked more
like me than I did, but they had the tattoo on the wrong arm'') and
played his 50th-birthday bash. Iron Maiden and Marilyn Manson came.
</P>
<P>
   Lemmy figures the only reason people called Motorhead a metal,
not a punk, band back in 1976 was because they had long hair. He's
still not wholly comfortable with ``metal'' as a term for what he
does and reckons that both genres at their best are ``just
offshoots of the original rock 'n' roll, what Elvis or Eddie
Cochran would be doing if they were 18 now.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the expected metal onslaught of Ozzfest, he says of
Motorhead: ``We give 'em a break. You can't listen to that (stuff)
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   So, will Motorhead be a revelation to the unwashed and
uninitiated? ``Those who don't know us going in will know us going
out,'' barks Lemmy. ``We ain't an easy act to follow. We ain't no
day at the ... beach. We're the real thing. Without us, who would
people get to point at and blame? ... We're probably gonna get
bounced off the tour _ we always do for bad behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The guys in the Melvins _ an iconoclastic, tat-tered legend of a
band from the great Northwest, a trio once worshiped by Nirvana's
late Kurt Cobain _ share the second-stage-headlining honors with
Motorhead.
</P>
<P>
   Happy to be there?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't go to Ozzfest,'' says singer King Buzzo, speaking
as if he were a potential ticket buyer. ``Nothing to do with the
musical thing. ... I'm not 17, I'm 34, and there's no point to an
all-day circus freak show unless it involved actual circus
freaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Melvins can entertain; the Melvins can aggravate. They can
move fast and ... very ... slow. The Melvins will mess with your
mind. ``I don't feel part of any musical scene and certainly not a
heavy-metal one,'' Buzzo says. ``We got involved basically 'cause
Tool wanted us to do it with them. ... I expect nothing from any
audience. I don't care what they think or do. But heavy metal, at
least, for all its trappings is `rebel' music, a little pointless
teenage rebellion. I do like Motorhead, but 85 percent of the bands
I haven't heard.''
</P>
<P>
   On the reflected glory from Nirvana, Buzzo says that ``99
percent of the people won't hear the connection and think we're a
stupid band. Nirvana were a big pop band. ... Hopefully, I can get
a good bird's-eye view of what the rest of these bands are doing
and do the polar opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger bands are, perhaps, not so ... prickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a pretty strange band,'' explains Sevendust drummer
Morgan Rose, who describes his band as heavy spooky-core. ``When we
wrote the stuff, it was just for us, we were fans of Pantera and
Korn, but so out of the loop. We were worried we'd be too melodic
for the metal people and too heavy for the melodic people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sevendust, which has been one of metal's top newcomers in the
past year or so, actually gets a bit of soul into its metal. Singer
Lajon Witherspoon, who listens to Sam Cooke and Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire,
can do more than just bark. He can croon. Sevendust ``stole'' him
from another band, and initially Witherspoon adopted a familar
metal rasp. Rose says, ``I told him, `Chill out and do what you
do.' And it's great. He's real versatile. Our chemistry is built by
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   The band has been on the road 15 straight months. Three of the
five members have lost long-term girlfriends. That's life. Their
time is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna bring something you've never witnessed,'' says the
hype-minded Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit. ``No, not dancing girls.
We're coming straight from the sewer, man. We're coming out of a
gigantic 13-foot toilet! I don't think any band's ever come out of
a big ol' toilet. I'm gonna be standing in the middle, flushing
some of your favorite artists.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll also be bringing a hip-hop flavor to the proceedings.
``We're heavy and, sometimes, we're not heavy,'' Durst says.
``We're metal-influenced. A lot of people call us hip-hop
crossover, alterna-tive/metal, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   If people just know the Limp Bizkit name or maybe just heard a
tune, that's cool, says Durst. The Ozzfest is a proving ground but
not, Durst hopes, a competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's a big family thing,'' he says. ``This isn't
sports. Festivity means fun. I have no fears playing in front of
that crowd. You've gotta see us live. I think we'll gain a lot of
friends and fans.''
</P>
<P>
   And why, in 1998, three decades after its beginnings, does heavy
metal still matter?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our world today is really emotional,'' says Durst. ``And metal
music is really emotional. A lot of dynamics. A lot of anger. And a
lot of just being heavy.''

SUMMER EVENTS ARE TITANIC AND TERRIFIC 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the best things about summer is the variety of festivals
and happenings _ some titanic in scope _ to choose from. On now or
coming soon are the coolest sounds of jazz, celebrations of black
ships and sweet onions, wild thrills on Maine's rivers, and Titanic
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   If you can spare some time, head now to Montreal for the 19th
annual International Jazz Festival through July 12. And, if you
can't go now, pencil it in for next year, if you love jazz, this is
the place for it. Musicians from 15 countries are participating
this year in 400 concerts, and most sessions asre free. For
festival information, call 888-515-0515; for Montreal information,
call 800-MONTREAL.
</P>
<P>
   While many Americans have questioned President Clinton's China
trip, the Black Ships Festival in Rhode Island July 16-19 recalls a
period when Japan closed itself off from the rest of the world
except for limited trade between China and the Dutch. In 1854,
Commodore Matthew C. Perry of Newport negotiated a the Treaty of
Kanagawa between the United States and the Edo Period Shogunate,
which ended Japan's isolation and began Japanese-American
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the treaty, Americans with their kurofune or black
ships were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   It is these new relations that are being celebrated in Newport
with a marvelous series of events including a Festival of Drums
featuring Taiko drummers, tea ceremonies, kimono displays, Sumo
wresting demonstrations, children's events _ even Sumo workshops,
flower arranging, and many more happenings. For festival
information, call 401-846-2720.
</P>
<P>
   Maui onions are the main ingredient at the ninth annual Maui
Onion Festival July 31-Aug. 2. This Hawaiian food fest features
Maui's top chefs, free cooking classes, and entertainment. The
festival is being held at Whalers Village, the oceanfront shopping
center. For information, call 808-661-4567.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought that white-water rafting was just for the big
kids, think again. At Unicorn Rafting Expeditions in Maine, family
riverside camping trips are the fastest- growing expedition. Seems
guests from the '80s are now returning with their children. Also
new this year at Unicorn are ``Wild Women Rafting'' weekends just
for women and led by women guides. On July 15, Unicorn is opening a
new Penobscot Resort with both camping and lodging facilities. And,
if you're really into white-water thrills, ask about Generator Days
such as tomorrow's when the power company releases twice the amount
of water as usual to provide unbelieveable thrills. Call
800-864-2676.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 86 years since the Titanic went down in the cold
Atlantic, but the story of this disaster has never been hotter than
this year. In Boston, ``Titanic _ the Artifact Exhibition'' has
just opened at the World Trade Center and its well worth the $13.95
adult admission. To see some of the objects _ a vase, some jewelry,
a sheet of music, a porthole _ recovered from the wreck 2 1/2 miles
below the sea is a haunting experience and a technological wonder.
Driving home after viewing the exhibit, I couldn't get over that
from my exit on Route 2 to my home is also 2 1/2 miles _ to dive
that distance where the water pressure is 6,000 pounds per inch is
mind-bogling. The exhibit both shows respect for those who died
that night while displaying the triumphs of the technology of
exploring the oceans. For information, call 888-744-7998.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket stubs to the exhibit are also good for a discount on the
Museum of Science's showings of ``Titanica,'' a fascinating
documentary about the famed luxury liner being shown on the Mugar
Theater's five-story screen. The film includes photographs from
1912 as well as unbelievable shots of the ship as it lies on the
ocean floor today. For information, call 617-723-2500.

HELPING MENTALLY ILL RETURN TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stricken with a psychiatric disorder that confined him to
society's margins, Bart Gottesdiener was certain he would never
resume his rightful place in the world, much less the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   But 18 years after a bizarre compulsion caused him to drop out
of American University Law School, Gottesdiener credits a new
generation of psychotropic drugs and Boston University's Center for
Psychiatric Rehabilitation with helping him find a job and turn his
life around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've proven to myself that I can work at a reasonable job,''
said the 42-year-old Brookline, Mass. resident. ``I have a support
system now, and a home. I've come far, and it looks like the worst
is over.''
</P>
<P>
   But for every mentally ill person who puts the past behind him,
thousands more struggle to overcome symptoms that distort reality,
not to mention stereotypes that impede even the most valiant effort
to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Returning to work is terrifying for people with mental
illness,'' noted Larry Kohn, director of services at the Center for
Psychiatric Rehabilitation. ``There is still a tremendous amount of
stigma associated with psychiatric disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1979 by William Anthony, a psychiatric rehabilitation
professor, the center was the first in the country to attempt to
help the mentally ill reshape their lives. With the development in
1993 of Training for the Future, a computer training program, the
center expanded its offerings. But it still has the same goal: to
assist the mentally ill in using their new skills as a stepping
stone to the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to think bagging groceries or pumping gas would be
less stressful for people with mental disabilities,'' said Anthony,
the center's director. ``That was a crazy way to look at vocational
rehabilitation. Working in a job that was not interesting caused
people even more stress.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder that in a society where the mentally ill are
often feared and sometimes shunned, the most difficult problem they
face is whether to disclose their past.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Considine, 26, of Holmdel, N.J., knows about such fears
firsthand. A vivacious woman whose rapid-fire speech and confident
ways contrast sharply with the person she used to be, Considine's
life was as frenzied as a roller-coaster ride eight years ago. She
went on binges, and then starved herself. She went without sleep,
and then couldn't get up at all.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the spring of 1990, Considine returned home from
college in even worse condition. &UR;  &LR; ``My parents thought I was on
drugs,'' she recalled. ``They took me to a psychiatrist and I was
diagnosed as having schizo affective disorder _ a mood and thought
disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, Considine started hearing voices. She became
depressed and afraid. Voices were saying her parents hated her,
that she was going to die.
</P>
<P>
   Several new drugs relieved Considine's depression, stabilized
her moods, and put an end to the hallucinations, but there was a
void. She wanted a job, an apartment, a new life.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Considine attends computer classes at the center, where
she is learning Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Word, and other
computer programs designed to prepare her for future employment.
Even so, there have been moments of fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the workplace is the main issue to deal with,''
Considine said. ``When I worked part time, people would ask why I
wasn't working full time. When I worked at a department store, my
hands shook because of the drug I was on. The store manager called
me in and asked if I had epilepsy. I made up some story.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not tell the truth? ``I couldn't imagine finding a
sympathetic ear, or a reliable person to talk to,'' she said
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1993 after IBM donated 15 computers and technical
assistance, Training for the Future is the brainchild of Kohn. With
little more to go on but an idea, he raised $112,000 from Lotus
Development Corp., Gillette, Houghton Mifflin, Polaroid, and other
companies. A $50,000 donation from Boston University provided the
seed money for a computer laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn gave each student in the first 15-member class a $6,000
scholarship. Since then, 56 people have graduated and 75 percent
are employed at Boston firms.
</P>
<P>
   One example: Laura Davis, a 23-year-old purchasing assistant at
the New England Aquarium. The center's job developer, Rob Salafia,
met with Davis several times before she went on an interview, and
he placed her in internships designed to ease her into competitive
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Using role playing, he taught Davis, who suffers from
depression, what to ask during an interview, how to dress, and how
to develop good listening skills. Then he secured a job commitment
from Steve Wong, purchasing agent at the aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers want to know what to expect from the new employee.
How does the person handle stress, and what are their functional
limitations?'' said Salafia. ``Graduates want help with
transitions. So I act as their coach and counselor. My role is to
build trust on both sides.''

CITIES HOPE TO SCORE WITH ALL-STAR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he saw two dozen stretch limousines pull up outside of
Coors Field in Denver, Steve Sabitini became convinced Major League
Baseball's All-Star Game was more than just a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all lined up at the curb, and the doors opened up, and it
was all owners of major league teams, some Hall of Famers and all
kinds of big shots from companies,'' said Sabatini, who saw the
procession while working across the street from the stadium as a
waiter at the Brekenridge Brewing Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up watching games in Fenway Park, and this is really a
historic event, here,'' said Sabatini, a self-styled baseball guru.
``But it's also brought a lot of money into town _ lots of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it has. According to tourist and hospitality industry
officials in several major cities, the showcase of Major League
Baseball's most &UR;  &LR; luminous stars has spurred spending of $28 million
to $38.5 million annually in recent years. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Denver have prepared feverishly, eyeing an even
higher payout.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, which will host the 1999 All-Star game, planning is
already well under way. &UR;  &LR; The Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors
Bureau projects the city will realize at least $40 million in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big economic boost for the city, it's not just an
All-Star game,'' said Mayor Thomas Menino, who is in Denver to meet
with Mayor Wellington Webb and his staff for advice on hosting the
event. ``In Cleveland two years ago, it attracted 120,000 people,
and Boston is a more attractive destination. So we ought to do
better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the revenue from tourism, baseball's All-Star game
provides a huge civic marketing opportunity. Hundreds of officials
from major corporations and their favored customers fly from across
the country to attend the game and the large, staged events that
now envelop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, in terms of the convention and tourist
industry perspective, it'll be another way to show the country and
the world what Boston is, and what we can do,'' said Patrick B.
Moscaritolo, president and chief executive of the Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Colorado Rockies and the Red Sox, the local
tourist industries, and the city governments in Denver and Boston
all say they have had to forge a well-coordinated master plan for
both All-Star Games.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball provides a 28-page list of items that the
host franchise and city must accomplish _ everything from how to
decorate the field and the ballpark to how corporate sponsors of
the game may use and display the ``marks'' of Major League Baseball
and the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Denver and the Rockies have amassed 1,200 to 1,500 volunteers
serving as hospitality agents in the airport, hotels, restaurants,
information areas and at the ballpark. They are guiding the 100,000
to 150,000 visitors _ two to three times the capacity of Coors
Field _ to the myriad of events that form what Major League
Baseball likes to call ``All-Star Week.'' A similar number of
volunteers will be sought in Boston next July.
</P>
<P>
   Events began officially on Friday &UR;  &LR; last week, but many of the
businessmen and team owners were in Denver as early as Wednesday,
when Sabatini stood and watched the line of limos roll up to the
ballpark. On Friday, Saturday &UR; , &LR;  and Sunday, tens of thousands of
fans attended The All-Star FanFest at the Colorado Convention
Center. The FanFest is an amalgam of events and displays arrayed
around 300,000 square feet of indoor space that take fans on an
extensive, often-interactive tour of the sport. Because far more
fans attend All-Star week than can fit into Coors Field or Fenway
Park, FanFest and other ancillary events now provide nearly as much
of an attraction for visitors as the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got races, and throwing skills, batting, it has displays
about how gloves are made _ on and on. It's terrific,'' &UR;  &LR; said Red
Sox spokesman Richard L. Bresciani, describing FanFest. ``In
Boston, this thing should attract 125,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Major League Baseball has been &UR;  &LR;  an enormous business
success in Denver, driving &UR;  &LR;  the dramatic revitalization of the
oldest section of the city _ the so-called LoDo (Lower Downtown)
district, where Coors Field and about 85 restaurants and
microbreweries, 20 art galleries and 500 loft apartments have
opened in the once-abandoned warehouse district.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout LoDo Friday through game night Tuesday, restaurants
and bars have been rented out by companies sponsoring private
parties for employees and customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all psyched up,'' said Sabatini, who helped play host to
MasterCard, which rented out the Breckenridge Brewing Co. for a
party featuring the club's microbrews and barbeque and pub food.
``We close three days a year: Memorial Day, Christmas Day and New
Year's Day. But we're going to close down for MasterCard.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks further into the LoDo and away from Coors Field,
The Denver Post is sponsoring a party Tuesday for employees and
readers at the Wynkoop Brew Co. The Post and the Rocky Mountain
News compete for the hearts of Rockies fans as they compete for
readers. While the News is an official sponsor of the team, the
Post likes to call itself ``the official sponsor of the fans.'' The
Wynkoop was prepared to handle more than 1,000 people at the Post's
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta love any event that happens early in the week, if
you are a restaurant,'' said Matt McAleer, the Wynkoop's marketing
director. ``And the All-Star game is always on a Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver officials say they hope all of this secures the future of
LoDo. The refurbishment of the area has sparkled since Coors Field
opened, in part because of spillover parking. Planners
intentionally provided parking for only 5,000 cars near the field,
so fans park along the streets in LoDo, often eating dinner before
games and stopping in for a nightcap afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hot now,'' said Eugene Dilbeck, president and chief
executive of the Denver Metro Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. ``This
week it is the focus of national attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday was MCI All-Star Workout Day, with the long-distance
carrier spending a tidy sum to sponsor the day and other companies
paying to sponsor individual events, including the Fleer Diamond
Skills National Finals, the MCI All-Star hitting challenge and the
Service Merchandise Home Run Derby. All of the money from Workout
Day goes to charity, with Major League Baseball and the host
franchise splitting the donations 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver Monday many fans who could not obtain tickets to the
game tried instead for tickets to Workout Day. In fact, with Fenway
Park's limited capacity, there is a possibility Workout Day will be
close to a sellout next year. And because both stadiums are
considered sluggers' parks _ Coors Field because of the thin air at
the high altitude, and Fenway because of its cozy confines _ the
home run competition is especially popular with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 people gathered Monday night at the Denver
Performing Arts Complex for the All-Star Gala, featuring food,
drink and entertainment, and another 5,000 fans were expected at
the Major League Baseball Pre-Game Celebration on Tuesday &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Boston are already preparing for many of the same
events for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bresciani says the Red Sox have sent 25 employees to Denver to
help them conceptualize what the team must do in and around Fenway
Park next July. The All-Star Game has not been played at Fenway
Park since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Moscaritolo and a member of his staff, and Robert V. Colarossi,
president of the Massachusetts Sports Partnership, are all joining
Menino in Denver in anticipation of the work that lies ahead to
prepare Boston for next year's event.
</P>
<P>
   Moscaritolo says 18 hotels already have been assembled in Boston
to provide 14,000 hotel rooms, and he and Bresciani say the hunt is
on for venues large enough to host many of the ancillary events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already gearing up to provide a really first-class
experience,'' Moscaritolo said.

A TAVERN IN THE TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKALL, Queensland, Australia _ Way beyond the blue horizon
might be one definition of the Australian Outback. Beyond
imagination and reason yet another. But as a young cowboy from
these parts, Damien Curr, says, ``It's beyond the Black Stump,
mate. Plain and simple. Take a step past the Black Stump and you're
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Alice falling down the rabbit hole?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, yeah. Sort of. We call it never-never land, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Prairies, deserts, canyons, mountains, stretching almost 2,000
miles. Hot, dry, spectacularly unpeopled, it reminds my friend
Aurelio of New Mexico where she was whelped, forever engraved on
her soul. It's still frontier country whose not-so-long-ago
pioneering and settling heroes, like sheep-shearing titan Jackie
Howe, were bigger than even Bunyanesque life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to be to survive,'' says Curr, who resembles the late
Audie Murphy, polite and smooth-faced protagonist of numerous
Western flicks. ``And you can still die out here if your car breaks
down and you don't have enough water along.''
</P>
<P>
   Water is, however, not the preferred liquid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be kind of nice to have a beer,'' says Peter Nichols, who is
showing us around this morning. ``You know, just to salute the
temperature, which _ in the non-Centigrade calculations of you
backward Yanks _ just arrived at 105.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's only dry heat,'' says Aurelio, bravely.
</P>
<P>
   ``But dry calls for wet,'' says Curr scientifically, amiably,
and who are we interlopers to question an Aussie icon? Damien, one
of the Antipodes's premier horsemen, is a rodeo and fancy riding
star. ``Let's go to my place.''
</P>
<P>
   This means a short ride (by auto) to Ilfracombe. With 159 humans
it would seem to qualify as _ in American lingo anyway _ a
one-horse town, although Damien employs many more for his
equestrian shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how you take the census around here?'' he says,
grinning. ``Just pull the fire alarm. Everybody turns out to see
the fire engine, and you count 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Publican and cattleman, Curr operates a 108-year-old saloon
called the Wellshot Hotel, with corral, riding ring, and grandstand
in the back yard as well as a ranching property in Winton. There,
Dagworth Station, the beloved bush poet ``Banjo'' Patterson stopped
long enough in 1895 to write what passes for the national anthem,
``Waltzing Matilda.''
</P>
<P>
   In Aussie parlance, especially rurally, a ``hotel'' is a tavern
required by law to maintain a few rooms (plumbing a remote rumor)
for transients. Generally, you wouldn't want to inhabit one of
those rooms, or pay more than $15. A motel is what you're looking
for. There are, however, emergencies such as found me a few years
ago at the indifferent mercy of the Jamberoo Hotel in the New South
Wales hamlet of that name.
</P>
<P>
   The clamor of the barroom directly below, where the jukebox
loudly and incessantly traumatized dancers with Slim Dusty's
mournful ``The Pub With No Beer!'' was equaled only by twanging
hordes of mosquitoes entering the unscreened bedroom window that
had been nailed open. Crowing roosters and lowing cows, their feed
apparently spiked with No-Doz, maintained a nightlong vocal
competition. A grudging dawn could not come soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hang onto your hats,'' advises Peter Nichols as we enter. Many
didn't. Attached to the ceiling, crammed together, are all manner
of headgear, from 10-gallon Stetsons and Panama straws to modest
baseball caps. Each has been traded for a beverage by a desperate,
presumably cash-short patron, fearful of uttering the saddest words
at this end of Christendom: ``I'm so thirsty, mate, I'd drink
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Having forestalled that fate through barter, the patron, says
Curr, usually orders Queensland's finest, XXXX Beer, known as 4X.
Excellent choice. Far ahead of any American beer, as well-traveled
Aussies never tire of confiding. To me, 4X always evokes a nice
little guy named Otis 5X, who drove Muhammad Ali's ``Big Red,'' the
bus Ali preferred to airplanes in his early championship days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be just Otis X, you know, like Malcolm X,'' Otis
said, ``but four other guys at our mosque beat me to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordering a 4X, I intend to purchase it, wary of surrendering my
wide-brimmed fishing hat and sacrificing the naked knob beneath to
the Outback sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. I'm shouting,'' says Damien, the common expression for
buying somebody a drink. Also the basis for the wonderful salute to
a tightwad: ``Wouldn't shout if a shark bit 'im.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. Thanks. I give him a verbal IOU, promising to send a Denver
Broncos cap. That seems fitting for a mustang buster. But one who
has studied the humane taming of horseflesh under extraordinary
Californian, Monty Roberts, of the fascinating autobiography ``The
Man Who Listens to Horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Damien had detoured us to the Wellshot, where a fish-and-chip
lunch served on burlap tablecloths goes with the 4X quite well. Now
it's back to Blackall, beneath a sky so vast the overpowering
clouds seem continents.
</P>
<P>
   Far out, but not too far for the ubiquitous computer as we note
at the recently established Internet Cafe. Log-on and lager-up
appears to be the BillGatesian setup for lonesome woolly-minded
types in this town where sheep have been very important residents.
Not his idea of a refuge, says Peter, who would rather take his
chances with the bites of a tarantula webbie than bytes of the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a matter of time, though, I suppose,'' he says with a
shrug.
</P>
<P>
   But time will never diminish the herculean 1892 feat of
Blackall's cease-less scissoring Jackie Howe, who had stronger,
quicker hands than Michael Jordan in a sweatier, more physically
demanding game. As proclaimed on the tablet beneath his statue _
Jackie embracing, defrocking a hefty ram _ he sheared 321 sheep in
7 hours 40 minutes: 1 1/2 sheep a minute. This was with manual
clippers!
</P>
<P>
   Not even Hollywood's Edward Scissorshands could have come close.
It wasn't until 1950 that someone topped his record _ but with
electric clippers. Little Bo Peep would have swooned at Jackie's
feet. Little Joe Lithgow, a shearer at Avon Leigh Station, told us
that, even with electricity, wrestling and baring 150 sheep is a
good day's work.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away is a lump of petrified wood marking the location of
the Black Stump. Surveyors, in the 19th-century mapping of
Queensland, used the thick tree stump (since burned out) as a base
for their large measuring instruments called theodolites. Anything
to the west _ beyond the Stump _ was considered Outback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just step beyond the Stump,'' Peter suggests to Aurelio.
``How's it feel?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like never-never land,'' she says, smiling. ``Like Alice
through the beer glass.''

HINE WILL SKIP TRIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once was enough for Sonny Hine.
</P>
<P>
   The irascible trainer of Skip Away took one trip to the West
Coast with his charge, the leading candidate to be Horse of the
Year, and watched him win the $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup June
28. But he's not going back, and the $1 million Pacific Classic at
Del Mar Aug. 15 is out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I take him all the way back out to California again, I may
blow my chance to make the Woodward, Jockey Club Gold Cup, and,
maybe, even the Breeders' Cup,'' said Hine, who has Skip Away
stabled at Belmont Park. ``After seeing what the last trip to
California did to him, I'm no longer that high on the Pacific
Classic. I'd rather run on the East Coast than the West Coast. If
they want to win a championship (hello, trainer Bob Baffert and
Silver Charm), let them come through New York.''
</P>
<P>
   There was once a chance that the long-anticipated matchup
between handicap champion Skip Away and 3-year-old champion Silver
Charm would come in the Pacific Classic. But that confrontation was
already in jeopardy since Silver Charm is recovering from a fever
that negated a late decision by Baffert to take Skip Away on in the
Hollywood Gold Cup. Silver Charm is supposed to be on the shelf
until near the end of the month and whether Baffert can get enough
training into him to make the Pacific Classic is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Hine is now looking toward the Iselin Handicap at Monmouth Park
Aug. 30 for Skip Away. However, there will have to be some major
changes in the Iselin if the big gray, who has won seven in a row
dating back to last year's Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont, is
going to compete. The Iselin is run at a mile and one-16th, short
by classic standards, and the now-retired Formal Gold simply
outsprinted Skip Away at that distance in last year's Iselin. Hine
wants the race lengthened to a 1 1/8 miles, and he wouldn't mind if
the purse, a modest $250,000 for a horse of Skip Away's quality,
was increased. ``If they don't change the distance, I'm not in,''
he said. ``They came to me, I didn't go to them. I think they
should do what they need to do to bring people in.''
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if Hine's wishes will be fulfilled. ``We'll do
everything we can to pull off what would be a major event,'' said
Monmouth vice president Bob Kulina. ``Obviously, the distance is a
question Sonny had. There's a lot of stuff we have to sleep on.''
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't work out with Monmouth, Hine will consider the
$400,000 Whitney Handicap at Saratoga Aug. 8. The Whitney is run at
1 1/8 miles and Skip Away finished third in it last year, behind
Will's Way, who is also retired, and Formal Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line, Hine wants Skip Away to make the $500,000 Woodward
Stakes at Belmont Sept. 19, a 9-furlong race around one turn that
he lost to Formal Gold last year in what was his last defeat.
That's the spot where Skip Away may finally meet Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iselin would be fine as a prep for the Woodward,'' said
Hine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Trick' disappears
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick, who was named Horse of the Year as a 2-year-old
over Skip Away last year in a display of poor judgment by many
Eclipse Award voters, has not run since his sorry eighth-place
finish in the Kentucky Derby May 2. Favorite Trick, who is
basically a miler, was knocked out by the 10-furlong Run for the
Roses.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Bill Mott is considering bringing Favorite Trick back in
either the Dwyer Stakes at Belmont July 12 or the Long Branch
Stakes at Monmouth July 19. Both events are at a mile and one-16th.
``I prefer to run my horses in New York,'' said Mott. ``This is
where I am based, and I don't like to ship too often. But Favorite
Trick was slow coming back from the Kentucky Derby, and then he
bruised his foot and we lost some training with him. The Dwyer was
his goal but I'm going to have to see if he needs an extra week.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Free' debut on tap
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Free House, who had a terrific 1997 season, is scheduled to make
his '98 bow in the $100,000 Bel Air Handicap, at a mile and
one-16th, at Hollywood Park Saturday. Free House has not raced
since bleeding profusely while finishing sixth as the 3-5 choice in
the Super Derby at Louisiana Downs Sept. 28. A powerful gray, Free
House attested to his readiness with a 5-furlong breeze in 1:003/5
under Chris McCarron at Hollywood Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Free House, a son of California sire Smokester, won $1,336,910
in purses last year, taking the San Felipe, the Santa Anita Derby
over Silver Charm, and the Swaps. He was third in the Kentucky
Derby, second in the Preakness, and then third again in the Belmont
Stakes. He was also third in the Haskell.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Girl' can get Tiara
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jersey Girl, a New Jersey-bred daughter of Belong to Me, can
become the ninth 3-year-old filly to sweep Belmont's Triple Tiara
if she can win the Coaching Club American Oaks July 25.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by Ackerley Brothers Farm and trained by Todd Pletcher,
Jersey Girl took the 1-mile Acorn June 7, and then the 1 1/8-mile
Mother Goose June 27, in which she defeated Kentucky Oaks winner
Keeper Hill.

BUSINESS IS GOOD FOR MCGWIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Half the fun of watching Mark McGwire is the joy of
watching him swing. His muscles flex, then the swing is set in
motion. On contact, there is a crack, and the ball soars skyward in
a high arc. If he has hit it just right, it comes gently back to
earth among a sea of smiling faces in the stands. It is something
to behold.
</P>
<P>
   Exciting to everyone except McGwire himself. The longtime
American League slugger who now is in the employ of the St. Louis
Cardinals, wishes people would remember that he has no overriding
interest in home run chases or the surrounding hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is just a job. If the fans get a kick out of the way he
works, fine. But keep things in perspective if he gets close in the
chase of Roger Maris for the record for home runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job,'' McGwire said recently in Cincinnati. ``I do it
every day. This is not a show. But I think it's good for the game
that fans are coming out to watch what I do, particularly in
batting practice. I don't do anything differently coming out for
work than I've done in the last 11 years. I have things to work
on.''
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke to a room full of media at Cinergy Field over the
weekend, he made sure to get across a simple message. Yes, his 37
home runs at the break suggest another 50-plus homer season and a
realistic chance to surpass Maris's mark of 61 in 1961. But don't
put the horse before the cart, at least until September. His total
tied Reggie Jackson (1969) for the highest total before the
All-Star Game. But remember, he's not the only slugger on the
block. Don't forget Ken Griffey of the Mariners and Sammy Sosa of
the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both very talented,'' said McGwire. ``Griffey has been
doing it for years. Sosa has been coming into his own for the last
several years. It's great. I love watching it. The only home run
any of us can look forward to is the next one. See me if somebody
has 50 and it's September.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire did things this way in 12 years in the AL, and has
continued in the National League. He won't change, but that is not
a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati is one of two cities in which he has not homered.
Each day of the recent series, he put on a show at batting
practice, once hitting one 452 feet into the third deck. He drew
extra fans, and helped sell a lot of hot dogs. But it didn't help
the Cardinals, as the Reds did not pitch to him, and won all three
games.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire got only one hit in six at-bats. He walked six times _
twice intentional. Saturday, with two out and the bases empty in a
4-4 game, he was walked by Reds manager Jack McKeon, who said he
only had done that to one other player, Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire knows he will have to deal with more of this down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing the game I love to play,'' he said. ``And when I
play, I know what to do. That's my domain. Players only have
control over what we can do to prepare ourselves for the game. We
don't know what we're going to do in the box. Realistically, we
understand we can't get a hit every day. You try to make
adjustments and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was born to bash. Even since his 49-home run season as a
rookie in 1987 at Oakland, he has been one of the game's premier
sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   But the NL crowds are not as familiar with McGwire, half
expecting the 6-foot-5-inch, 250-pounder to be a monster. They are
delighted to discover how intelligent, friendly, and unique he is.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had a lifetime .260 average at the start of the season,
with 387 home runs. He won a World Series ring in 1989. Tonight is
his 10th trip to an All-Star Game, his fifth as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   It's his job, his lifestyle, and he had no problems with taking
part in last night's home run derby, or signing autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says, ``Everything I've read recently is about
individuals. But this is a team sport. No one individual is going
to win a game for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I say, what Griffey says, and what Sosa says is the same
thing. The most important thing is winning. Sometimes people lose
track and put a lot of emphasis on the home run. I've never been
like that. It's still overwhelming for me and for those guys,
too.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Easier said than done
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, not a lot of people paid attention to McGwire, who
had a nice season for Oakland with a .284 average and 34 home runs.
In July, time was winding down on the final year of a five-year
contract. The A's had to make a move or lose him to free agency. So
McGwire was traded to St. Louis for pitchers T.J. Mathews, Eric
Ludwick, and Blake Stein.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit 24 home runs for St. Louis the rest of the way for a
total of 58, the most since Maris in '61. Coupled with the 52 he
hit in 1996, he joined Babe Ruth as the only men to have
back-to-back 50 home run seasons. How tough is that? Ask
Baltimore's Brady Anderson, who hit 50 in '96 and 18 the following
season.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire didn't have to return to St. Louis this year. It is a
big ballpark in which for years speed, not power, was a key
consideration. But in his brief tour on the Mississippi River,
McGwire had fun playing for the St. Louis fans and his longtime
manager in Oakland, Tony La Russa. The deep sense of tradition,
missing in Oakland, intrigued him. Thus McGwire signed a
three-year, $28.5 million contract in the offseason, with an option
that could boost it to $40 million. He has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy,'' said McGwire. ``Certainly not just because it
looks easy. I prepare myself mentally, and use my mind as well as
my talent. Some of the physical stuff we go through that people
don't know about is incredible. I know my swing like the back of my
hand. I'll make the adjustments when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about the home run. But the home run does not
control the game. It's the players themselves. I've seen it. There
is so much pressure on Sosa, Griffey, and myself right now. Yeah,
it's a great thing. But the media is building it up like it's
supposed to be done. And yet, this is the toughest thing of all to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Reds drew 41,302 to see McGwire's first visit to
their stadium, one of only two where he has failed to homer (Turner
Field is the other). The game drew a walkup crowd of 9,338, the
Reds' most since 1974. McGwire walked twice and went 0 for 1. The
fans booed their own team when an intentional pass was issued. They
like McGwire and wanted to see him go deep. More curiosity seekers
showed up Saturday. Three walks. It was more of the same Sunday.
No, it isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do enjoying playing the game,'' said McGwire, ``but I've
never been a guy who liked to be singled out. The good Lord gave me
the ability to do certain things, and I have acccomplished some
things. But you won't find me talking about the home run record.
Nobody is close to it. The only thing we're close to is the next
home run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(September) is when somebody has a legtimate shot at it. Until
then, it's just speculation. Seems like every year I've played,
there has been somebody near or over 30. Everybody talks about it,
but let's be realistic.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Comfy surroundings
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The chances of the record falling aren't as dismal as McGwire
might want you believe. Despite its distant fences, Busch Stadium
is the site of 19 of his 37 homers this season. His teammates
admire him. His reunion with La Russa means he has a manager who is
as experienced with the pressures as he is, and he's also a friend.
He has had the benefits of Barry Weinberg, the Oakland trainer for
16 years, who has joined him in St. Louis. McGwire has only missed
one series (June 2-4 against the Dodgers) with back spasms, and
avoiding injury will be crucial in the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually goes out just once a year and then it is no
problem,'' said Weiner of McGwire's back. ``The key, of course, is
the hard work he does every day. You wouldn't believe how hard he
works. Mark takes good care of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa says the McGwire of today is an even better player and
person than the one he was first introduced to in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's better now, no matter where he is,'' said La Russa. ``He
keeps on improving. He's a little tougher putout, too. He's
swinging better. The big difference is in his thinking. His
concentration is locked in and he doesn't throw at-bats away. Day
after day. That's why he's going to be great under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis hitting instructor Dave Parker feels the same way. He
not only monitors McGwire's batting practice ``show'', but also the
media that might try to break his concentration. McGwire is no
longer complaining about being a ``caged animal'' during BP.
</P>
<P>
   Parker played with McGwire early in McGwire's Oakland career and
said, ``When you look at him now he's more compact. He's got a
shorter swing, and he's a lot stronger. He doesn't have to worry
about anybody bothering him, anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa says that no matter how things turn out, McGwire is the
right guy to make a run at the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he takes batting practice,'' says La Russa,``he's putting
a lot of pressure on himself. But you know he does it because he
knows people are here, he's a good guy, and he doesn't want to let
them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his pluses to our club is he gets the ball into the air
for distance. I don't want him chopping down, and we're not playing
hit-and-run. His ability is his team thing. He's not being selfish
to enlarge his zone. He'll take a walk just to get a rally going.
When you do that, it's team baseball.''

THOSE HEROES IN SCARLET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA MATCHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ The Mountie was big. Seriously big.
</P>
<P>
   And full of hot air. If he were real, the 150-foot-high hot-air
balloon shaped like a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer atop a
horse would weigh 450 tons.
</P>
<P>
   So when this odd apparition &UR;  &LR; made its debut at a festival
earlier this summer high above Canada's capital city, the cheers
from the crowd were thunderous.
</P>
<P>
   But then, nothing less spectacular would do for this occasion,
the 125th anniversary of the RCMP _ a police force with a cachet
that goes far beyond its official federal, provincial, and
municipal law-enforcement duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one thing to remember about us,'' says retired Deputy
Commissioner William Kelly, who joined the force in 1933. ``Other
police officers are known as cops. We're known as Mounties. And
there's one heck of a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly they've had their share of criticism and embarrassment
_ such as the night in Ottawa in 1995, when RCMP officers guarding
the official residence of Prime Minister Jean Chretien took a full
seven minutes to respond to a telephone call by Mme. Chretien that
a knife-wielding intruder was outside their bedroom door. (By the
time the Mounties got there, the prime minister had been forced to
arm himself with the only weapon he could get his hands on, the
Inuit soapstone sculpture near his bedside.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's probably no other Canadian institution so
glorified inside Canada and famous outside of it than the trusty
scarlet-coated Mounties with their lantern jaws and romantic
history of heroic deeds _ a history that dates to 1873 when the
force was formed to maintain order as settlers swept into the
western frontier. With their crimson coats, trusty steeds, and the
mission to ``always get their man,'' the Mounties have attained the
implausible status of pop culture icon. (Think of Dudley Do-Right,
Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, the musical Mountie chorus of
``Monty Python.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to get excited about Massachusetts state
troopers, but somehow the Mounties caught on,'' says Bernard A.
Drew, a writer and author of the 1990 book ``Lawmen in Scarlet: An
Annotated Guide to Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Print and
Performance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had their scandals in recent years, but somehow they
clicked, whereas the national law body in India or Brazil never
did.''
</P>
<P>
   So all the stops are being pulled out this summer and fall for
the anniversary milestone, the so-called ``One-Two-Five.'' A
commemorative Mountie silver dollar has been issued.  &UR;  &LR; A Mountie
postage stamp will soon be released. A new RCMP history book, ``Red
Coats on the Prairies,'' has just been published. Even the RCMP's
antidrug campaign has gotten a facelift, featuring new bumper
stickers that depict a horse and say ``Say Neigh to Drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the elaborate Mountie festivities _ more than
500 public events through October, from community picnics to bike
rodeos. What the public will see is vintage RCMP: colorful,
patriotic, and loaded with pomp and ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Especially The Ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Musical Ride, as it's more properly known, is the Mounties'
piece de resistance. Among the last links with RCMP early history,
it is a 25-minute riding display performed by 32 Mounties in formal
RCMP dress (red tunic, Sam Brown belt, Stetson hat, and high brown
boots.)
</P>
<P>
   Developed from traditional cavalry drill movements, inspired by
British tradition, the first known riding display was given in
1876, ostensibly as a way for the officers to break up the monotony
of patrolling the plains in the dead of winter. In 1904, it became
a regular form of public entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Mounties take their show on the Canadian road from May
through October, plus some American stops and occasionally a
European tour. An estimated 1 million people annually flock to see
it. There is scarcely a child in Canada unfamiliar with the image
of a scarlet-coated Mountie on a black horse with a maple leaf
stenciled on its rump. The pageantry of the elaborate maneuvers,
many executed with medieval-looking lances and pennants, never
fails to wow the crowd _ and often the riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets me every single time we lower the flag,'' says
Katherine  &UR;  &LR; Simard, one of seven women riders in the equitation
unit. ``When I see those little faces (in the audience) beaming up
at me, I cry every time.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Mounties are scheduled to perform at three
American locations. (see below). ``But our main mandate is to show
for the Canadian public,'' says Corporal Bill Stewart, a horse
trainer with the Mounties for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Canada love it,'' says William Beahan, coauthor
of the new Mountie history book ``Red Coats on the Prairies.''
``It's a big boost to the community. I don't think Canada would
ever let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for this love affair is that the Mounties are
so deeply ensconced in Canadian culture. The children of Canada
even get to name the Mountie horses in an ongoing ``Name the Foal
Contest.'' (Approximately 15,000 entries pour in each year, with
names like ``Patrol'' and `Pulsar'' and ``Pichou.'') It doesn't
hurt, either, that the Mounties have a bit of the royal touch. Part
of the mounted unit's official function is providing mounted
escorts for Queen Elizabeth and other visiting dignitaries. ``We're
very close to the queen, horsewise,'' says Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   So what if the music is canned (the RCMP band was disbanded a
few years ago due to budget cutbacks) and the show is, by today's
standards, low-tech and even a little hokey: At a recent ``sunset
ceremony'' here, the horses and riders stood at attention while the
emcee led the crowd in a rousing rendition of ``Happy Birthday to
Us.''
</P>
<P>
   But this seems to matter not a whit to Canadians. ``I'm proud
it's not so glitzy,'' said one woman who saw the show and who asked
not to be identified, for fear of offending the Mounties. ``If the
Americans got their hands on it, it would be a Vegas revue.''

AUDUBON LEGACY TAKES FLIGHT AT NEW BEDFORD ART MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By M.R. MONTGOMERY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE AUDUBON LEGACY 
At the New Bedford Museum of Art, 
680 Pleasant St., New Bedford, through July 19. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BEDFORD, Mass. _ Just entering its second year this summer,
the New Bedford Museum of Art continues to make a virtue of
necessities. It has no comprehensive core collection, it is run by
part-time paid staff and volunteers, and its most noticeable
architectural feature is a huge bank vault that dominates one end
of its downstairs gallery. Its single most important physical asset
is a complete Elephant Folio edition of John James Audubon's
``Birds of America,'' which technically belongs to the New Bedford
Public Library, across Pleasant Street from the museum, but which
the museum has undertaken to restore, preserve, and present. Local
citizens and corporations have donated at the rate of $1,000 per
image to bring the Audubon plates up to archival standards and put
them in elegant frames.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's first show (through July 19) relies on all the
museum's assets. Eighteen of the magnificent Audubons are on
display on the ground floor of the museum. A volunteer curator has
assembled a complementary show of commissioned work related to,
relying on, reflective of, the Audubon prints. And the bulk of the
commissioned works, gathered as ``The Audubon Legacy,'' are hung
inside the huge downstairs vault, the museum's signature space for
new and untraditional artworks.
</P>
<P>
   The real legacy of Audubon is difficult to describe. He was
hardly the greatest bird artist of his century, let alone all time
(whatever that means). His near-contemporary Edward Lear (better
known for light verse) was a defter draftsman and capable of
putting the birds in more lifelike positions. Aubudon's birds are
often beautiful, but less often are they posed in entirely
believable situations and postures. That said, his work completely
outclassed anything that came before him.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, focusing on Audubon's life, not just his art, is a
blessing for the 18 artists who accepted commissions to take
Audubon's legacy and create their own works. Audubon is an
excellent illustrator, but an artist coming after him is not
overwhelmed by Audubon's mastery. What really inspires in Audubon's
work is his persistence, his absolute faith in his own grand
vision, his insistence on perfection as he defined it.
</P>
<P>
   Audubon chose the Elephant Folio, with a single rectangular
sheet over a yard wide, because he could fit the largest American
bird on the format in life-size. This worked well for everything
but very long-necked birds, which had to be posed in contorted, if
theoretically possible, stances. His flamingo seems to have been
the prototype for Lewis Carroll's croquet set, where the birds were
unwillingly twisted into both mallets and wickets.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Backes, a landscape painter, curated the legacy show by an
inventive method, not in the usual tradition of wildlife art. She
visited New Bedford and Boston galleries, found artists whose work
she liked, regardless of subject matter or medium, and commissioned
them to work off, with, through, even around, the Audubon theme.
What she ended up with was not a show about birds (though there is
a bird, or part of a bird, in every work) but a show about
translating nature into art, or letting nature inform art.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most Audubon-like works is Roger Kizik's ``Perusing
Puffins,'' except that Kizik's quizzical bird (the puffin is an
inherently comical animal) isn't contemplating its mate or staring
at the ocean (Audubon's birds occasionally have rather unfocused
poses). Kizik's puffin is reading the first page of James Joyce's
``Ulysses,'' where stately, plump Buck Mulligan emerges from the
bath, about to shave blasphemously.
</P>
<P>
   A work inspired by the Audubon portrait of the passenger pigeon
(alive and thriving by the millions when he painted it) is
necessarily transformed by the bird's subsequent extinction. Diane
Horton's complex-media painting (oil alkyd/ &QC; 
wax on wood) has transferred the repeated image of the passenger
pigeon into a very manipulated surface that forces the bird to
recede into a limbo that can stand for, but not stridently comment
on, extinction. She does this with stenciled drawings on canvas
that are overpainted, rubbed out, redrawn, glazed, sanded down,
wiped, varnished again, and that end up both optically and
physically layered.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Bertoni, a sculptor, leapt at the chance for a
post-Audubon moment, since she has been fond of birds, and pileated
woodpeckers in particular, since childhood. The pileated is the one
that looks like, and in fact sounds like, the cartoon character of
Woody Woodpecker. The difference is that the real pileated is about
as serious a bird as one ever encounters. Her simple sculpture, of
found wood and paint, astonishes a viewer who enters the vault.
Even from a distance it is clearly an abstraction, and somehow it
still looks as though a real pileated woodpecker, or perhaps the
mummified remains of one, had found its way into the bank's most
protected space. In fact, one would do just as well, if not better,
using Bertoni's sculpture as a visual aid to identify a real
pileated woodpecker than if one had a copy of Audubon's plate of a
family of the things. Bertoni has got what British birders call the
``jizz'' of a bird, its visual and behavioral persona, exactly
right.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities for a show of Audubon legacies have hardly
been exhausted by this satisfying exhibition. There are a few
hundred more birds to use as inspiration, and it would also be
possible to assemble a show of artists working in the
representational manner of Audubon. He has his followers, and some
of them at least equal, if not surpass, the master. A show of
Audubons hung alongside paintings by the greatest bird artist of
the early 20th century, Louis Agassiz Fuertes of Cornell
University, would be a revelation. Fuertes's work is seldom seen
except as illustration plates, as in the two-volume, long-
out-of-print works ``Birds of Massachusetts'' and ``Birds of New
York.'' And there are dozens more artists painting birds with
Audubon's passion. As satisfying and enlightening as ``modern'' art
can be, a museum with a core of representational work could
consider celebrating those schools of painting and sculpture.

CAUTION NEEDED IN NET BANKING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theres's been lots of talk about investment scams over the
Internet. Now there's a new frontier _ bogus bank sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Bank regulators have begun surfing the Net looking for
fraudulent Internet bank sites. They're especially concerned about
ones that are likely to be confused with the sites of legitimate
banks that have opened up in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a high-value target, so there's a lot of incentive for
people to duplicate,'' said Bill Carr, a partner at KPMG Peat
Marwick in Houston, who heads the firm's information risk
management practice for the Southwest region. ``You can pull in
funds from all over the U.S. and from all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures bank
deposits, recently launched a ``Suspicious Internet Banking'' Web
site to help consumers detect potentially fraudulent banking
activity in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it hasn't been a big problem. FDIC officials said that
last year, regulators caught six fraudulent bank Web sites, none of
which was in Texas. One in the Southeast had collected $650,000 of
consumers' money.
</P>
<P>
   Texas hasn't experienced serious problems with fake bank sites,
but that is no guarantee you won't reach one from your PC at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could easily happen because the Internet is global,'' said
Catherine Ghiglieri, Texas banking commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy for a hacker to duplicate someone else's Web site and
have it look legitimate, Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   Before doing business with a bank on the Internet, go to the
FDIC's Web site at www.fdic.gov.
</P>
<P>
   After clicking on ``Consumer News'' or ``Banking News,'' click
on ``Suspicious Internet Banking'' and go to the FDIC's
institutions search engine. There you will find instructions on how
to use the search tool.
</P>
<P>
   On the site, you can find out whether a bank is a legitimately
chartered, FDIC-insured institution and you also can report
suspicious bank Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're saying they're a bank and they're not a bank,
that's illegal,'' said David Barr, FDIC spokesman. ``If they're
indicating that they have FDIC insurance and they don't, that's
illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDIC also posts on its home page Web sites found to be
fraudulent and special alerts on unauthorized banking operations in
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find them on the FDIC site, you also can check out
a bank on the Texas Department of Banking's Web site at
www.banking.state.tx.us/.
</P>
<P>
   Fraudulent entities also will try to disguise themselves through
subtle changes such as using a derivative of a legitimate bank's
name that's close enough to the real thing that you wouldn't notice
anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they may call themselves ``Citicorp N.A. (which
means it's a nationally chartered bank).'' The problem with that
name is that Citicorp is the name of the holding company. Citibank
is the name of its bank operation.
</P>
<P>
   Scam artists are often quicker than regulators and their lists.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they're not on a warning list, make sure they act like a
legitimate bank.
</P>
<P>
   One way to spot a questionable bank is how it pitches its
products to you. It's a red flag if the institution offers
abnormally low rates on loans or extraordinarily high interest
rates on deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking 6, 7 or 8 percent; we're talking 18, 19
percent interest rates,'' Barr said. ``A lot of them claim they do
this because their operating costs are lower. Granted, that is
true, but they're not that much lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Another warning sign is if the bank's Web location doesn't have
a direct address such as ``www.bank.com,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like `geocity.jonesborobank.com,''' he said.
``Usually, if it's a real bank, it would be
`www.jonesborobank.com.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pay close attention if the bank lists a post office box instead
of a street address. There's a reason why fraudulent operations do
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, the cops don't have an office, a house or a building
to raid,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, just because a bank operates only on the Net
doesn't mean it's trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But understand that there are only about three pure Internet
banks out of the 10,800 FDIC-insured banks in the nation, Barr
said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that helps cautious consumers is that a bank must have
a charter to do business.

NORTH CAROLINA'S OUTER BANKS OFFER HAVEN FOR LAND-BOUND SURFERS

   CAPE HATTERAS, N.C. _ As the discussion rambled on, I began to
understand why superior surfboard shapers are so revered in the
surfing community. This was better than going to a Park Avenue
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear that we were talking less about templates and
outlines and rocker and volume of surfboards and more of making
peace with my life as a surfer from Albany, N.Y. Strange as that
sounds, it's possible to live in upstate New York and surf.
</P>
<P>
   Pouring out of me, like water out of a grommet's nose after a
morning session, was the story: How I was born and spent most of
the first 25 years in California (a stone's throw from the Pacific)
and much of that time surfing. How career choices led to the least
likely of surf towns. Having to adapt to not having an ocean in the
back yard.
</P>
<P>
   We reflected on the fact that while living in California, the
surfing was limited primarily to local breaks. Since leaving, it's
had to be more creative.
</P>
<P>
   Living in Albany has required traveling to surf spots. This is
not altogether a bad thing. In fact, I have found it liberating,
and a pleasure to be part of a fledgling group of upstate New
Yorkers who surf. Several of us have gathered at 5 a.m., loaded my
Jeep down with surfboards and have driven four hours to the coast,
usually New Hampshire or Rhode Island (the most direct, accessible
spots). Once there, we surf for six hours, only to turn around and
drive the four hours back to Albany.
</P>
<P>
   It is satisfying to help someone catch a wave for the first
time. Someone who will forever know the out-of-body sensation when
human energy becomes a part of some larger fundamental transfer of
energy. A wave is energy, after all. A worldly one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing, then, is simply employing the laws of physics,
exploiting and redirecting that energy through the use of floatable
devices.
</P>
<P>
   The sensation, described as a rush by surfers, comes as the
larger force overtakes the human effort and lifts the surfer up, as
if by the hand of God. The feeling is just as thrilling after 20
years of surfing as it was on that first memorable wave. There is a
look of pure, childlike joy on the faces of people who connect with
that pulse of energy for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Not having a local break also means adopting world famous breaks
as my own, scheduling vacation time around exotic surf
destinations: North Shore of Oahu; Puerto Escondido, Mexico; and
Pichelemu, Chile, among them.
</P>
<P>
   But one place stands as my Cape Hatteras on the Outer Banks of
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it sits on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States
and, therefore, just south of a most populous corridor, the
onslaught of ubiquitous development, and the misfortune of having
Jesse Helms as U.S. senator, it's possible to find there a slice of
the most pristine, flawless stretch of coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Cape Hatteras is one of the continuous barrier islands that run
along the East Coast from Maine to Georgia. The narrow strands of
sand, dunes, and adapted vegetation, on the front line of hurricane
assaults, migrate steadily south with the winds, tides, and
currents. Slammed in the winter by nor'easters only to face
tropical storms and hurricanes' havoc in the late summer and fall,
the Banks' mercurial weather precipitated hundreds of shipwrecks
off its coast, earning it the nickname ``The Graveyard of the
Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   The legend goes that pirates walked horses with lanterns along
the beach to imitate ships at sea to lure unsuspecting vessels onto
the shallow shoals to plunder. ``Boilers,'' a popular surf break,
resulted from a sunken ship, its boiler still visible above the
waves like a bobbing tombstone.
</P>
<P>
   For years, because of harsh conditions, few lived out there.
Year-round populations are still small, with permanent communities
in Buxton, Frisco, and Hatteras on the widest, most protected parts
of Hatteras Island, and Okracoke, on the bayside of that island.
The few locals who are around are generally mellow, described by
professional surfer Shea Lopez in a surf magazine as ``the nicest
bunch of hicks you'll find.''
</P>
<P>
   Though not primitive, this is distinctly not Cape Cod, the
Hamptons, or Jersey Shore. Fleeing the overrun Nag's Head and Kitty
Hawk, cross the Oregon Inlet Bridge and enter the 12-mile stretch
of the Pea Island National Wildlife Preserve. This is the start of
Cape Hatteras National Seashore, which stretches the length of
Hatteras Island, and therefore one of several long chunks of
protected coastline nestled by dunes and marshes throughout
Hatteras.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to hike out over a windblown dune onto a stretch
of beach without another human in sight and look toward the ocean
and see the most perfectly shaped waves, glistening magically as
they peel down the shore, crackling in exultation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE HATTERAS, N.C. _ Things to do on Cape Hatteras when you're
not surfing:
</P>
<P>
   Shipwrecks and pirates: The Outer Banks, also known as ``The
Graveyard of the Atlantic,'' feature hundreds of ships that have
been buried over several hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boilers,'' now a surf break, lies just off the Pea Island
seashore. A ship's boiler appears bobbing above the surf. It's
possible to snorkel in and around some of the wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Pea Island nature preserve: An inter-convergence zone of birds,
particularly during fall and spring migrations. It is a sometime
island, during the high tide or when an inlet opens.
</P>
<P>
   Chicamacomico Lifesaving Station: This is the highly respected,
all-black Coast Guard station. A guard, from the tiny cupola,
searches the sea for distress signals, and other guards risk their
lives in treacherous surf to recover ship crews.
</P>
<P>
   Water desalinization plant: It may be considered quirky
entertainment by some, but a tour of this high-tech, high-volume,
plant, processing brackish water from a deep aquifer, and which,
for better or for worse, makes all this tourism possible.
</P>
<P>
   Buxton Woods: A rare and ever-shrinking maritime forest. Take a
walk in the dark and steamy woods, alive with kingsnakes, deep
sand, standing pools of black water. There is horseback riding on
beach and through the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Biking: Distances are long but it's very flat on Highway 12, the
only thoroughfare. Avoid Saturday-Sunday arrival and exodus of
vacationers and weekenders. For bike rentals, call Island Cycles,
Avon, 800-229-7810.
</P>
<P>
   Surf casting and clamming: Just like the great bird migration,
the waters off the Banks host a convergence of tropical and cold
water fish during spring and fall migrations.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins frolic, usually earlier than one wishes to rise during
vacation, but the sunrise and empty beach make the experience worth
the loss of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Take a flashlight and chase crabs on the beach at night (make
sure you rent a cottage without a television): The beach appears
iridescent in the light.
</P>
<P>
   Ferry to Okracoke Island: For miles of truly deserted beaches,
the village has been weathered to perfection over the years on a
protected harbor, with shops and restaurants, and artists in
residence.
</P>
<P>
   For food, try Billy's Fish House, offering fresh catch and
southern hush puppies.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist information: Dare County Tourist Bureau 800-446-6262;
North Carolina Tourism, 800-VisitNC
</P>
<P>
   Major Property Rental Companies: All will send catalogs with
photos of properties. A variety of cottage sizes and prices. Some
cottages permit dogs to make your family vacation complete. Sun

   WASH-CHERRIES (Zillah, Wash.) _ These are happy days in the
orchards of the Yakima Valley, the nation's premier cherry-growing
region. Last year's crop, over 90,000 tons, was the largest on
record, and the experts are predict that as young trees come into
production crops of 110,000 tons and more are possible over the
next five years. Still, the day before the harvest begins is a
tense time. Hundreds of thousands of dollars hang in the balance. A
rain storm, even a few unexpected gusts of wind, could wipe out the
work of a year in a matter of hours. By Frank J. Prial.

   NY-BRUNCH (New York) _ When the weekend arrives and the city's

favorite meal. It is called brunch, and it is weird. A linguistic

cocktail. Or a lunch that's organized around a stack of buckwheat

all three can wind up on the same plate. By William Grimes.

   FLORIDA-CARIBBEAN (Miami) _ On a blistering South Florida
afternoon whose heat approximates a restaurant kitchen's, Norman
Van Aken, dressed from chin to cuffs in his white chef's outfit,
looks refreshed and cool as he cuts a path through sweaty shoppers
inside the Palacio de los Jugos market. It looks less than regal,
but for Van Aken, the fresh fruits and vegetables shipped here
daily from the Caribbean, Latin America and other tropical lands
represent the raw material for dishes fit for gastronomic royalty.
Van Aken is the head chef and partner in Norman's in nearby Coral
Gables, which is widely considered the best restaurant in South
Florida. A pioneer in the Florida-Caribbean fusion cooking that he
calls New World cuisine, Van Aken is perhaps the best known of the
Miami chefs collectively called ``The Mango Gang.'' By Jon

Allende's kitchen was as innocent and unblemished as a perfect egg
yolk. It slid across the hand-painted ceramic tile counter, warmed
her back and made her dangling silver earrings sparkle. But the
56-year-old Chilean novelist was, for the moment, immune to the
poetry and the pleasure of the spring sun. Bent in her own shadow,
calibrating the flame under the omelet pan on her stove, Ms.
Allende, had surrendered to an atavistic ritual of the kind that
might have made a scene in one of her novels. By Molly O'Neill.

ONE BOTTLE OF WHISKEY; TWO SHOTS

 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - The story in The Arizona Repubic might have left you
with the wrong impression because of the two guys who were quoted
making excuses _ one for the 20-year-old ex-con, the other for the
cop who shot him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Dad, I'm going to have my little fling . . . and
then, that's it. It's time for me to get my life together,' '' the
dead man's father said..
</P>
<P>
   ``These are split-second decisions,'' answered the police
department spokesman. ``Everybody can play Monday night
quarterback, but you weren't there and you don't know how quick
things are escalated.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men are wrong, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But for the right reason.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fairly simple one. While they disagree on just about
everything that happened last Saturday night at the Harbor Ridge
apartment complex on North 29th Street, they share one virtue:
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if the ex-con or the cop deserve it. Or even
need it. It's there. It was there when the call came into police
dispatch complaining about a couple of rowdy drunks roaming around
an apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Shover Jr. had been out of prison less than a week. He'd
been sent up on a probation violation and served six months. It
wasn't the first time he'd been locked away.
</P>
<P>
   Shover knew last week that getting drunk would be yet another
probation violation, but there he was, wobbling around with a
nearly full bottle of Jack Daniel's, raising hell.
</P>
<P>
   It could be Harold Jr. meant it when he told his father this was
to be his last ``little fling.'' It even could be his father
believed him, though I doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   A father knows his son.
</P>
<P>
   If ``the little fling'' that got Shover sent back to prison six
months ago didn't work, nothing would. Except maybe a couple of
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The police say Shover was waving the bottle of whiskey over his
head as officers approached him. The department spokesman said the
drunk young man could have hit an officer on the head or grabbed an
officer's weapon.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that's true, but only if Phoenix police officers now
attend the academy of Barney Fife.
</P>
<P>
   A man from the apartment complex said he confronted Shover when
he saw him trying to get into a pickup truck that wasn't his.
</P>
<P>
   ``He swung at me twice (with the bottle) and missed both
times,'' the man said, ``and I never moved.''
</P>
<P>
   The police had everything in their favor. They outnumbered him.
They were sober. They were trained. They have stun guns, pepper
spray, beanbag weapons and night sticks. They had time.
</P>
<P>
   Shover had time, too.
</P>
<P>
   He had time to straighten out his life, but didn't. He had time
to play it smart for once, and not drink. He had time to surrender
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, one man got two bullets in the chest and the newspaper
got a song and dance sung in two-part disharmony.
</P>
<P>
   I have a rule at work and at home that has to do with being
critical of family or co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is: Don't.
</P>
<P>
   Not in front of outsiders, anyway. Inside the office or at home,
anything goes, but outside, you stick with your guys.
</P>
<P>
   I'm hoping that's what's going on here.
</P>
<P>
   I'm hoping that privately the family of Harold Shover Jr. is
almost as angry at him as they are with the police; that they're
ticked off he put himself in a position to get killed.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, at police headquarters _ where they're just getting
over a $5.3 million settlement for an unwarranted killing and now
face the possibility of another one _ I'm hoping word from the top
is, ``Never again.''
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty is good.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty is to be admired, especially in a world where it
sometimes seems as if anyone will sell out anybody for any reason.
</P>
<P>
   But a drunk getting shot dead?
</P>
<P>
   There's no excuse for that. &QL;

SHERMAN ALEXIE MASKS HIS FEELINGS BUT NOT HIS PURPOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Photo available through Wieck Photo Database)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Behold the dazzling fancy dance of Sherman Alexie.
</P>
<P>
   Behold how a ridiculed outcast on the Spokane Indian Reservation
transforms himself into a lavishly praised literary author and film
writer.
</P>
<P>
   The fancy dance begins when Alexie survives brain surgery only
months after his birth, an operation doctors said the baby probably
would not live through _ or would emerge from severely retarded. A
Catholic priest is summoned to baptize the baby and also administer
last rites.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie survives frequent consignment to a hospital room where
the only escape is books _ he learns to read at age 3. He survives
government surplus food and surplus eyeglasses and years of
tauntings and beatings by other Indian boys who picked on their
frail and bookish classmate for being ``an apple'' (red outside,
white inside).
</P>
<P>
   Alexie also survives crushing poverty, alcoholic parents,
epileptic seizures until the age of 7 and the death of his beloved
older sister and her husband in a trailer fire after a night of
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   But watch Alexie rise: He decides to leave the reservation (the
``rez'') and enroll as a student at the nearby farm town of
Reardan, the only Indian in a tiny high school whose sports teams
are the Reardan Indians. He soars to high school heights _
president of the freshman class, member of the debate team that
went to the national championship in Kansas, president of Future
Farmers of America, captain of the basketball team, member of
National Honor Society.
</P>
<P>
   Observe Alexie fall: He scores scholarships to Gonzaga
University, arrives on campus and short-circuits from a terminal
case of frat-boy culture shock. He becomes a binge drunk and
college dropout after two years, drifts to Seattle and sinks so
subterranean that he works as graveyard sandwich slinger at a
Hoagie's Corner where a robbery at knife point becomes a wake-up
from the nightmare of his squandered potential.
</P>
<P>
   Then watch Alexie rise again: He retreats to the rez, transfers
to Washington State University, quits booze cold turkey on the day
after he ruined his girlfriend's birthday, then flowers as a
fledgling writer of poems, under cherished professor Alex Kuo, and
gives readings in a Pullman coffee shop before crowds that grow to
200.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, behold Alexie's fancy dance stretch across the country
and garner rave reviews and headline attention, including ``one of
the major lyric voices of our time'' (New York Times Book Review on
his first book), ``one of the 20 best American novelists under age
40'' (Granta Magazine), plus ``one of the 100 most creative people
in entertainment'' (Entertainment Weekly).
</P>
<P>
   Alexie is, at 31, becoming ``The Most Famous Indian in
America,'' but he cautions, ``The second you think you deserve it,
you get in trouble. I think that's when you become a raving
egomaniac instead of just an egomaniac. I'm arrogant enough as it
is; I don't need to encourage my own arrogance by thinking I
deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked hard and I'm reasonably talented. And working hard
has a lot to do with it. There are plenty of writers who are a lot
more talented than me, but there are very, very, very few who work
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two Sherman Alexie's, different and distinct from each
other, as is pointed out by the writer himself and his closest
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife, Diane, says she can watch me at a dinner that's a mix
of friends and business associates,'' Alexie relates, ``and she can
see me switch persona in midsentence.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the public Alexie. Supremely confident, even cocky.
Never at a loss for words, quips or opinions. Mature way beyond his
years. A charismatic performer with a laser wit who delights in
confounding his mostly white audiences. He keeps them off guard
with his wisecracks about stereotypes that sound like some Indian
version of Richard Pryor or Eddie Murphy, and then shifts to his
``pissed-off Indian'' utterances that sound like a movement
militant time-tripped from the late 1960s. All this sarcasm and
irony comes with an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laughter is an effective political weapon,'' Alexie
emphasizes. `` ... Is that calculated on my part? Oh yeah, although
it's not a calculated thing for me to be funny. I am funny. But
that persona is on purpose. Nothing in my career is an accident.
The results _ you never know exactly what's going to happen. But
I've planned.''
</P>
<P>
   So Alexie strides on stage and just lets loose:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to answer a few of your questions before you ask them.
No. 1. I prefer Indian, not Native American. Native American is a
white guilt term. No. 2. No, I've never ridden a horse. No. 3. No,
I don't live in a tepee. No. 4. No, I don't know where you can get
Navajo rugs cheap. No. 5. Yes, some of my best friends are white.''
</P>
<P>
   But the uproarious laughter will die down later when Alexie
castigates white writers who write, in his view, badly and
presumptuously about Indian life. Or attacks whites who are smitten
with things Indian, from sweat lodges to vision quests to drumming
in the wilds.
</P>
<P>
   Or even skewers other successful men of color who marry white
women, something he might have done until he met and married Diane
Tomhave, the third love of his life and the first Indian, a woman
of Hidatsa/Ho Chunk/Potawatomi heritage. She has a master's degree
in theology and has worked as an academic adviser at the college
level.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the private Alexie. Quieter, even circumspect,
except about basketball. Loyal to friends and publishers who helped
him on the way up. Committed to being a role model for young
Indians, visiting dozens of reservations, teaching classes,
contributing money. Protective of his personal life, refusing to
allow his wife to be part of publicity, or their young son or their
home in the upscale, racially mixed neighborhood of Madrona.
</P>
<P>
   The real difference between the public Alexie and the private
Alexie is the degree of alienation and doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie, who is of Spokane/Coeur d'Alene descent, is a bona fide
celebrity in his adopted home of Seattle, with its liberal
consciousness and its unabashed love of writers. The lanky
6-foot-2-inch figure with a mane of black hair is frequently
approached by strangers bearing compliments and was even recognized
recently when shopping for underwear (``Man, we never thought you'd
be shopping at Sears!'').
</P>
<P>
   The public Alexie helped create the attention, but the private
Alexie views his celebrity with uneasiness, although he disguises
that well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feel isolated and alone here in Seattle,'' Alexie
admits. `` ... The comparison I always tell white people is to
imagine yourself in Compton, Calif. (a predominantly black city
south of Los Angeles) at midnight on a Friday and that's how I feel
all the time in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel threatened, physically threatened. But I feel
isolated and often nervous, highly aware of my body, my self. And
that's not only from being Indian. It's also part of being this
writer guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Tulee, a Yakama Indian, has known Alexie as a youth
(called Junior) on the Spokane Reservation, as a fellow student at
Washington State and in Seattle. Tulee has often reflected upon
what it takes for Alexie to inhabit such different personas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult,'' Tulee says. ``In public, people think
Sherman is performing and he is performing. But when we're just
ourselves and allowed to be ourselves, he is much more complex.
Sherman is enjoying his fame in a good way, but he is also aware of
how it kind of owns him. ... He does have to split things. He can
share some of his personal life with his audience, but he has to
put that in a different persona. If he mixed the two, then it would
be something he could never own. He has to keep something for
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Alexie, the author's mother, concurs: ``My son has
learned to wear many masks to cover up his feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie is seldom happier than when he turns hermit and cranks
out pages of work. He even boldly concedes that Diane sometimes
comes second to his writing. But Alexie's prolific output across a
wide territory of writing springs at least partly from a single
emotion: fear.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Alexie is a workaholic writer on the run because he is
haunted by his past and afraid of what might be his future.
</P>
<P>
   His past on the reservation provided a wealth of stories for
Alexie's writing, but he paid dearly. The Alexie family barely
scraped by, with father Sherman Alexie Sr. working infrequently as
a laborer because of his medical problems; he came and went from
the family for a week or two with unpredictable irregularity.
Lillian Alexie earned a little from sewing quilts and working as a
clerk at the reservation trading post in Wellpinit.
</P>
<P>
   Both Alexies were bedeviled by alcohol, until Lillian Alexie
finally quit drinking in 1974 and went on to become a substance
abuse counselor with the tribe. The Alexie children _ Mary; Arnold;
Sherman Jr.; twin sisters, Kim and Arlene; James _ were often left
to their own devices, existing sometimes on what Sherman would
later describe as ``wish sandwiches, two slices of bread with only
wishes in-between.''
</P>
<P>
   His childhood prompts Alexie to reflect: ``Although I can look
back and recall all sorts of instances of happiness, the general
feeling is miserable. It was of being poor _ that's what did it. I
recall having to fight for every damn thing, having nothing of
privilege, so I could never take anything for granted. There was
never a moment when I could relax. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nobody in my ancestry who distinguished himself in
the way that I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That drive remains undiminished, even after Alexie has now done
so well for his family in Seattle and his family on the reservation
that potato chips, once a coveted treat immediately consumed upon
purchase, now sit around the Alexie home undisturbed for days. The
writer even jokes about how ``I have a mortgage, I have life
insurance, I have IRAs of three varieties, I have three lawyers,
I'm an inc. (FallsApart Productions Inc.)''
</P>
<P>
   Money may buy welcome comforts, but Alexie remains acutely aware
of mortality, how the average life expectancy of an Indian male in
America is just over 50 years _ no abstract statistic for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm constantly convinced I'm going to die in a car wreck, a
plane wreck, some automobile-locomotive thing,'' Alexie emphasizes.
``I get scared on Amtrak trains. ... There's too long a history of
our people dying young. I've seen too many of my friends die to not
be affected by it and to not be afraid of the same fate.''
</P>
<P>
   His writing, especially his poetry, sometimes seems to get
overshadowed by the media phenomenon of Sherman Alexie. He was
originally published by tiny Hanging Loose Press in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
with poems in its magazine, then with a 1992 collection of poems,
``The Business of Fancydancing,'' that set off the first chorus of
raves, including the New York Times Book Review's hosanna that
publisher Robert Hershon had to read twice to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie's ``The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven'' was
published by the Atlantic Monthly Press in 1993 after publisher
Morgan Entrekin had been tipped off about this ``new voice'' by
bookseller Michael Coy of Seattle. But Atlantic Monthly Press put
considerable money behind its new author of short stories,
dispatching him on the first of his grueling book tours across
America, a key element of Alexie's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherman's a trouper,'' Entrekin emphasizes. ``Sending him on
tour was the most effective way to promote him, especially when he
has such incredible presence. He works in person _ and if you've
got it, use it. Sherman understood why that's important from the
outset and he proved he would keep at it to the point of utter
exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Business of Fancydancing'' (16,000 copies in print) and
``The Lone Ranger and Tonto'' (114,000) went on to become Alexie's
most popular books of poetry and prose. Both show Alexie at his
most creative, with dazzling leaps of language and image and a
gut-punch combo of humor and pathos, plus a portrait of Indians as
resilient survivors who rely on humor and irony to get them through
too many tragedies. Alexie as a writer showed much the same skills
that he would later ascribe to baseball wizard Ozzie Smith _ ``a
Langston Hughes-of-the-diamond, bebop, improvisational jazzman
shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   So in ``The Business of Fancydancing,'' Alexie describes the
enlarged brain condition (hydrocephalus) that led to his perilous
surgery as an infant: ``My skull was expanding, pushing outward,
all the while changing my hearing and my vision, even changing the
shape of my teeth. I was born with dreams, lies, lust, all
impossibly large, filling my mind and spilling out onto the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Writer William Kittredge of Missoula, Mont., first met Alexie as
a WSU student and he included some of Alexie's early poems when he
edited ``The Viking Portable Western Reader,'' a 1997 anthology of
essential literature from the West.
</P>
<P>
   Kittredge considers Alexie to be ``a writer of great force and
great imaginative power who is developing at a great rate. ... He
gives us whites a sense of a subculture within our culture that we
seldom find out about. His work invites whites in, but also helps
Indians define themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most writers, Alexie is his own toughest critic. Reviewers
had been unanimous in praising Alexie until his 1996 novel,
``Indian Killer,'' a conventional thriller about a serial killer
scalping white men and terrorizing Seattle (what he calls ``a
cracked and perverted fairy tale'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian Killer'' was Alexie as artist-provocateur with a novel
about racial hatred intended to confound readers' expectations and
provoke outrage. But the criticism of Alexie remained muted,
perhaps because these are such hyper-sensitive times about race and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   As Alexie himself jokes, ``I was surprised there wasn't more
criticism, but you know good white liberals _ they love a good
beating from a brown guy. ... Maybe this is a little bit of
literary reparations. Never before in world history has an Indian
received a literary accolade based on his Indian-ness. So if that's
true, great.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie assesses his own work with the same shocking frankness he
uses on other targets: ``I'm overrated.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not Alexie playing at being humble. He recognizes that
his prodigious output (one story collection, two novels, four major
poetry collections, four small poetry limited editions) in just six
years contains work of uneven quality. When ``Reservation Blues''
was one of eight finalists for the richest prize in world
literature, Alexie said he was ``shocked'' because he would grade
his first novel with a C-.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Alexie takes great pride in his best work. He believes
his strongest talents are as a poet _ ``that's the way I think,
everything starts as a poem.'' But he quickly cites ``The Lone
Ranger and Tonto'' as ``the best work I've ever done ... the best
work I'll ever do, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie is no elitist literary writer. He is an equal opportunity
consumer of American popular culture with rampant enthusiasms _
``The Brady Bunch,'' country legend Hank Williams, TV's Jane
Pauley, singer Tori Amos, bluesman Robert Johnson, Dungeons and
Dragons, horrormeister Stephen King, ``The Graduate,'' ``Midnight
Cowboy,'' ``Alien.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was probably inevitable that this lifelong movie lover
would leap at the chance to have his work translated to film.
``Smoke Signals,'' an engaging and bittersweet road movie directed
by fellow Indian Chris Eyre that opened nationally last weekend, is
Alexie's adaptation of several short stories from ``The Lone Ranger
and Tonto.'' He is scheduled to write and direct ``Indian Killer''
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Most writers are content to take the money and run with their
big dollars from Hollywood. But Alexie is intent on becoming a film
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in going unread and I'm not interested in
being unseen; art is public and the most public art form is the
movies,'' Alexie says. `` ... The thing is _ everything is going to
benefit everything else; a successful movie will make the books
sell a whole lot more copies and I'm quite aware of that. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You can affect people in larger ways with film not only in
terms of sheer numbers, but also in terms of emotional impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie is not without his critics these days, even if literary
critics have treated him mostly with white gloves. He has risen too
high too fast and been too outspoken not to spawn some animosity
and jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that, Alexie recognizes, he brought on himself. The
public act may have worked a little too well, at least in cementing
certain perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm mean,'' Alexie relates. ``I think that's one
of the public perceptions of me _ meanness. And, you know, I've
created that. I've certainly worked at that, being the angry
Indian. `Indian Killer' was part of that whole mythos. It worked,
all right, but it's really kind of hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no smiles for anyone when Alexie canceled his reading
in January before a PEN/Faulkner audience in Washington, D.C., only
days beforehand. Never in the 15-year history of the prestigious
series had a writer decided not to appear and Alexie's no-show was
widely reported. And a group of Washington inner-city students were
stiffed by a writer whose work they had studied in advance of his
visit to their school.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie sent a $1,000 donation and an apology to the writer's
organization, but Janice Delaney, PEN/-Faulkner's director, was not
mollified: ``Sherman Alexie did not fulfill his obligation and
sending a donation did not fulfill it either, although I'm glad he
has a conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie blames his cancellation on illness and exhaustion wrought
by his immersion in the Sundance Film Festival, a crucial event for
``Smoke Signals''' future: ``I had overextended myself _ I really
underestimated the effect that the Sundance Film Festival would
have on me. The people at PEN/Faulkner made a big public deal out
of it, trying to shame me, which was fine. It was my fault. I
admitted responsibility. ... I made mistakes, I'm not perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   A more lasting question about Alexie is whether all the early
and extravagant praise, plus all his diverse projects, will somehow
dilute his talent. Tom Robbins, the imaginative novelist from La
Conner, has seen that happen with other writers.
</P>
<P>
   As Robbins says, ``Alexie's first collection of stories was
witty and poignant, biting and soulful. The book attracted a lot of
praise, certainly well-deserved praise. But it was somewhat
unfortunate for Alexie.
</P>
<P>
   ``When writers that young are praised to that extent, they are
often crippled by it. The danger is that they become careless and
sloppy, not work hard enough, not bear down enough and continue to
grow as a writer. ... I'm not saying that has happened with Alexie.
I'm saying that's the danger and I hope he recognizes that and
finds a way to avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie is rushing across the country these days, from premieres
of ``Smoke Signals'' on both coasts to television appearances on
Charley Rose, CNN and Good Morning America. He is scheduled to be
one of eight people in a television dialogue on race with President
Bill Clinton tomorrow in Washington, D.C., that will be broadcast
on PBS with Jim Lehrer moderating (at 7 p.m. Thursday on KCTS/9 in
Seattle).
</P>
<P>
   Alexie is weary, but gratified in his moment of his greatest
national fame, saying, ``No Indian has ever been offered these
kinds of opportunities _ I'm being offered multipicture deals with
Hollywood studios. ... I cannot let that go. My friendships suffer,
my family life suffers, I suffer. But there's some sense of larger
responsibility in it, and also a huge sense of ego. I am the first,
I like being the first, I want to be the first.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie has even come to accept the slights and hurts that once
rankled him, including the fact that he has never been asked to
read his work on the Spokane Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to hear the tribe's headliner have had to travel
the 50 miles to Spokane. But others in the tribe would not walk
across the street to hear Alexie, with the way this big city big
shot has exposed and profited from so many of their rez stories,
including his frequently told tale about the drunk who passed out
and drowned face down in a mud puddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do my best not to antagonize those people who are
antagonistic toward me on the rez _ I don't need that grief and
they don't either,'' Alexie says. ``My literary career has not
changed my reservation's opinion of me. The people who loved me
when I was 7 love me now. The people who hated me then hate me now.
It would be the same if I was a successful carpenter or lawyer or
doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie knows he has what truly matters to him. He has sobriety,
what he considers the greatest accomplishment of his life. He has
his wife and he has his son, although that was once in grave doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In an eerie reprise of Alexie's own infancy, Joseph Alexie was
born with a serious medical problem that put him in intensive care
with a grim prognosis. There were weeks of great trial and tension
for the young family. Lillian Alexie worried her son might return
to drinking, but he did not.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Alexie survived and is now prospering, and his father is
loathe to see parallels to his own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to be learned from it,'' Alexie says. ``If you
start looking for connections, you're going to blow your brains
out. It's a s----- coincidence, that's all. Besides, I'm Indian _
so there's no why me? I mean we get our ass kicked for hundreds of
years. Another slap across the face is not going to cause me to
start feeling sorry for myself. ... Besides, I've got cousins in
jail, and cousins dead and cousins dying of cirrhosis of the liver
at age 25. I've got it pretty damn good.''
</P>
<P>
   There are moments when Alexie will be watching television or
driving his beat-up car and it will hit him, a sudden flash of
satisfaction over what he's been able to accomplish so quickly.
Often, it will make him laugh out loud, a common Alexie response,
although his real feelings run deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``People listen _ that's all you can ask for,'' Alexie says.
``And through that, you hope you can change some people's opinions
and change the world a little, too. I mean, I'm going to be
remembered. I've made a difference in some way or other. One
hundred years from now, my work will still be in textbooks
somewhere, so I've got my tiny little bit of immortality.''

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - The story in The Arizona Repubic might have left you
with the wrong impression because of the two guys who were quoted
making excuses _ one for the 20-year-old ex-con, the other for the
cop who shot him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Dad, I'm going to have my little fling . . . and
then, that's it. It's time for me to get my life together,' '' the
dead man's father said..
</P>
<P>
   ``These are split-second decisions,'' answered the police
department spokesman. ``Everybody can play Monday night
quarterback, but you weren't there and you don't know how quick
things are escalated.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men are wrong, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But for the right reason.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fairly simple one. While they disagree on just about
everything that happened last Saturday night at the Harbor Ridge
apartment complex on North 29th Street, they share one virtue:
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if the ex-con or the cop deserve it. Or even
need it. It's there. It was there when the call came into police
dispatch complaining about a couple of rowdy drunks roaming around
an apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Shover Jr. had been out of prison less than a week. He'd
been sent up on a probation violation and served six months. It
wasn't the first time he'd been locked away.
</P>
<P>
   Shover knew last week that getting drunk would be yet another
probation violation, but there he was, wobbling around with a
nearly full bottle of Jack Daniel's, raising hell.
</P>
<P>
   It could be Harold Jr. meant it when he told his father this was
to be his last ``little fling.'' It even could be his father
believed him, though I doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   A father knows his son.
</P>
<P>
   If ``the little fling'' that got Shover sent back to prison six
months ago didn't work, nothing would. Except maybe a couple of
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The police say Shover was waving the bottle of whiskey over his
head as officers approached him. The department spokesman said the
drunk young man could have hit an officer on the head or grabbed an
officer's weapon.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that's true, but only if Phoenix police officers now
attend the academy of Barney Fife.
</P>
<P>
   A man from the apartment complex said he confronted Shover when
he saw him trying to get into a pickup truck that wasn't his.
</P>
<P>
   ``He swung at me twice (with the bottle) and missed both
times,'' the man said, ``and I never moved.''
</P>
<P>
   The police had everything in their favor. They outnumbered him.
They were sober. They were trained. They have stun guns, pepper
spray, beanbag weapons and night sticks. They had time.
</P>
<P>
   Shover had time, too.
</P>
<P>
   He had time to straighten out his life, but didn't. He had time
to play it smart for once, and not drink. He had time to surrender
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, one man got two bullets in the chest and the newspaper
got a song and dance sung in two-part disharmony.
</P>
<P>
   I have a rule at work and at home that has to do with being
critical of family or co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is: Don't.
</P>
<P>
   Not in front of outsiders, anyway. Inside the office or at home,
anything goes, but outside, you stick with your guys.
</P>
<P>
   I'm hoping that's what's going on here.
</P>
<P>
   I'm hoping that privately the family of Harold Shover Jr. is
almost as angry at him as they are with the police; that they're
ticked off he put himself in a position to get killed.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, at police headquarters _ where they're just getting
over a $5.3 million settlement for an unwarranted killing and now
face the possibility of another one _ I'm hoping word from the top
is, ``Never again.''
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty is good.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty is to be admired, especially in a world where it
sometimes seems as if anyone will sell out anybody for any reason.
</P>
<P>
   But a drunk getting shot dead?
</P>
<P>
   There's no excuse for that. &QL;

ACTOR GIVES AFFECTIONATE TOUR OF THE DECADE OF CHANGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MITCHELL J. SHIELDS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ About halfway through actor and writer Peter Coyote's
engaging if occasionally frustrating memoir of life in the 1960s,
``Sleeping Where I Fall'' (Counterpoint, $26), he relates a brief
but telling anecdote about a friend named Marty who had been living
for a while in a commune in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Marty, a large, muscular fellow with a surfeit of body hair and
a broken nose, showed up one day at Coyote's place in San Francisco
with a fistful of money and a directive from the women in his group
to get a vasectomy. His medical mission _ which made a certain
amount of sense considering that, as Coyote recalls, Marty ``was
copulating his brains out'' as part of his communal experience _
raised fewer eyebrows than did his attire: a demure dress and a
scarf tied like a babushka to cover his long pigtails.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of Coyote's story is found not in the fact that his
friend was brave enough, or outrageous enough, to wear a dress. As
anyone who's been to San Francisco (or Houston, for that matter) in
the last few decades knows, men wearing dresses aren't exactly a
unique phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   No, the point of Coyote's tale is that Marty had no idea he was
being outrageous. He didn't wear what he did to shock or startle or
make a statement. He was completely guileless, so deep into trying
out a different way of living that he'd forgotten it was different.
</P>
<P>
   And that, Coyote wants his readers to know, is something that is
too frequently left out of the deluge of books written about the
'60s: how sweetly seductive the call to experiment with new modes
of living was for many people of that era and how deeply intense
was their commitment.
</P>
<P>
   In Coyote's view, remembrances of the 1960s tend too often to be
either nostalgic romances that dismiss the passions of the time as
the indulgences of youth or denunciations of the David Horowitz
variety that apologize for a revolutionary past and trace the
nation's current ills to the decade's unthought-through radicalism.
</P>
<P>
   What Coyote tries to do in ``Sleeping Where I Fall'' is walk a
third path, to admit to errors but not deny the importance of those
who attempted to expand society's boundaries, to chronicle in a
straightforward way both the human potential discovered and the
human cost of that discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Coyote is a good choice to do just that. Though he's best-known
today as an actor _ his resume includes roles in movies ranging
from the recent ``Sphere to E.T.'' to Pedro Almovodar's ``Kika''
and, it seems, the voice-over narration of every other nature
documentary out there _ he came to celebrity late.
</P>
<P>
   Born Peter Cohon, the son of a successful East Coast investment
banker, his first passions were for literature and the stage, and
in 1964, after graduating from a Midwestern college, he moved to
San Francisco to study creative writing and acting.
</P>
<P>
   Before long he'd given up his professorial pipe and tweeds for
long hair, leathers and a life that brought him in contact with the
San Francisco Mime Troupe, the Hell's Angels, the Grateful Dead
and, most important, the Diggers, a short-lived community of
anarchists whose main contribution to the counterculture was the
notion of living free. An open-ended idea, the latter included
everything from giving up individual identity (Emmett Grogan, one
of the founders of the Diggers, allowed anyone to use his name,
making himself in one fell swoop both mythic and anonymous) to
creating stores in which anything inside was available at no cost
to whoever wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   The contradictions inherent in this were obvious: No matter how
many times Grogan handed his name out, it was still his to give,
and at some point somebody, somewhere, had paid in time or money
for what was ``free'' in the free stores.
</P>
<P>
   But consistency didn't particularly matter to the Diggers. What
mattered was getting people to question the very foundations of the
life they led, to assume that nothing was a given, that everything
was open.
</P>
<P>
   One of the disappointments of ``Sleeping Where I Fall'' is that
Coyote doesn't explore this concept more fully. He shows its
impact, especially among those with whom he moves back to the earth
in various California communes, but he doesn't really explore its
meaning. But then again, considering how slippery the idea is and
how he tends to wander into somewhat hoary-sounding rhetoric when
he tries to wrestle with it, perhaps it's best that Coyote focuses
more on the people he knew than on the philosophies that drove
them.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by journals he kept at the time, follow-up interviews and
what is apparently a prodigiously detailed memory (despite frequent
indulgence in drugs of the day), Coyote paints a number of
memorable portraits _ so many, in fact, that by book's end they
begin to jumble together, the members of one commune blending into
the members of the next. (This is not, as it happens, a problem
with the essay that sparked this book, ``Carla's Story,'' which
deservedly won a Pushcart Prize for nonfiction in 1994 and can be
found by anyone who's interested at www.petercoyote.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, these individual tales are bound up by Coyote's own
passage, which eventually brings him back home (where his friends
trash his father's estate), then on to chair the California Arts
Council and finally, starting in his late 30s, to success as a
movie actor.

<P>
   Perhaps because of the same chameleonlike quality that makes him
a good performer, Coyote was able to move easily among a number of
different groups, and he kept his eyes open wherever he was.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a slow start and a few lapses here and there, ``Sleeping
Where I Fall'' tells what he saw with skill, honesty and, perhaps
most remarkably, a passion only slightly diminished by the years
that have passed since he first toyed with the thought that the
world could be changed for the better. That we haven't toyed with
the thought more, Coyote suggests, is our loss.

<P>
   Personal-care products like Rogaine or Retin A are aimed
specifically at a maturing populace, but age is not a big issue
when it comes to marketing fashion to baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say the strategy they employ to lure
middle-aged Americans into buying apparel transcends age.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion firms target the baby-boom generation by portraying
their products as fitting a certain lifestyle or state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty once was considered over the hill, but now it is widely
regarded as an age when people are at the peak of their
professional and personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   This new attitude is especially appealing to female consumers of
this era, who have broken the stereotype that maturity means a
woman is no longer attractive or desirable.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of fresh self-esteem among the middle-aged is the
target of many fashion firms: They're marketing their products as
part of an aspirational goal _ looking and feeling great,
regardless of age.
</P>
<P>
   A brand _ whether it's as generic as Coca-Cola or has the
distinct cachet of Calvin Klein _ is often what compels consumers
to buy a bra, dress, suit or pair of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the power of a brand, targeting baby boomers _
generally defined as people born between 1946 and 1964 _ can be a
complicated issue.
</P>
<P>
   While the post-World War II generation can be characterized by
distinct demographic, social and economic traits, baby boomers have
a broad range of lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, fashion marketers said they are just as hard to peg as
their junior counterparts, who can range from 13 to 30.
</P>
<P>
   The segment includes boomers still living the disco lifestyle of
the '70s, those who prefer a quiet evening watching ``Seinfeld''
reruns, people dedicated to careers above all else, health
enthusiasts and those who ``shop till they drop'' at
Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   So while baby boomers may be an affluent and appealing target
segment, they also present a challenge to marketers because of the
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what some top executives _ a majority of whom are baby
boomers _ had to say about mid-life marketing:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Linda J. Wachner, &LR;  president, chairman and chief executive
officer of The Warnaco Group, said, ``I really don't think it's the
consumer as much as it is a state of mind when it comes to baby
boomers. As a matter of fact, I think consumers are sick of being
called baby boomers. It's really about an attitude and a look.
Staying sexy and pretty _ that's what the consumer wants.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wachner's estimation, the image of the glamorous, buffed
supermodel Christy Turlington is a main ingredient of the success
of Warnaco's ads for Calvin Klein Underwear and Calvin Klein Jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of women out there who don't look like Christy
Turlington, but many certainly want to look like her _ even though
they might not necessarily be young,'' Wachner said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Albert Shapiro, &LR;  vice president of corporate marketing at Liz
Claiborne Inc., stated, ``It's really all about a brand, not an
age. Fashion is all about lifestyle and attitude. I think in order
for fashion products to be successful, they need to have a
lifestyle appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that mature and glamour are relatively
exclusive. In fact, they are very clearly aligned. In part, the
more mature the woman, the more glamorous she is because she has a
sense of style, self-confidence and sophistication.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro noted that the ad campaigns for Liz Claiborne are
``distinguished to have universal appeal,'' and do not target
younger or older consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we selected Niki Taylor for our campaign,'' he
said. ``She's very appealing and approachable. We did consumer
focus groups with our ads, and compared her with other
possibilities. She does not turn people away. She represents the
Liz Claiborne attitude and lifestyle, regardless of age.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kenneth Zimmerman, &LR;  chairman and ceo of Kenar Enterprises,
said, ``We merchandise for a modern mind _ whether it's career or
casual. We use Linda Evangelista in our ads because she's a woman
in her 30s, not a girl. Kenar is addressing the real world. In our
ads, we show clothes for the woman with a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenar is about lifestyle and looking good. If you walk into my
Madison Avenue or East Hampton shops, my customers include three
generations, ranging from 21-year-olds to 40 and 70-year-olds,''
Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 48. I have a son who's 20, and I feel as young as him. He
borrows my clothes and I sometimes borrow his jeans. I think a lot
of people in America think like that today.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman said he has taken the message of fashion one step
further by addressing two hot-button issues: breast-cancer
awareness and pediatric AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   One campaign for early detection of breast cancer is targeted at
the baby boomer who buys Kenar; the other ad for pediatric AIDS is
aimed at a younger woman who most likely has young children, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers _ young and old _ are concerned about these
issues,'' Zimmerman said. ``We want them to know we are, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Barry Boyd, &LR;  executive vice president of the Hanes and Hanes
Her Way megabrands at Sara Lee Knits, noted, ``Our strategy
definitely is about brand, not age. Our brands are as generic as
Coca-Cola. And they have very broad, public appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have customers who are older, younger and people
in-between. We are very aware of demographics and age trends.
However, a lot of ad agencies today tend to think very young _ too
young. I try to discourage that. The 50-year-old of today is very
different from the 50-year-old of yesterday. She's far more
confident and she doesn't think like her mother.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nancy Friedman, &LR;  vice president of marketing for Slackers, a
men's pants brand at Levi Strauss Co., noted, ``We introduced the
Slackers brand two years ago specifically to meet the needs of male
baby boomers, who are trying to adjust to the casualization and new
dress codes in corporate America. They felt they needed more
options between khakis and suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The launch has been very successful. The newest ad campaign
will be all about a competitive edge, doing well at work and home,
wanting to be noticed. We chose models in their late 30s _ men who
were not too modely, but nice looking; looks a consumer can relate
to,'' Friedman said. ``We've heard a lot of feedback from women
about doing a line for female baby boomers. That's on the
horizon.'' &QL;

ALL EYES ON PASADENA FOR TV CRITICS MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The postcard-pretty grounds of California's
Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel evoke wispy visions of another time.
Tucked into a quiet corner of Pasadena _ eons away from such
look-at-me destinations as Laguna Beach or Santa Barbara _ the
elegantly understated surroundings hint at whispered intimacies
taking place far from the fadding crowd of LaLaLand.
</P>
<P>
   Except maybe for two weeks in January and three weeks in July.
That's when the L.A. limo brigade makes daily treks to Pasadena to
deliver an assortment of big names and bigger egos to a huddled
mass of TV writers yearning to breathe the latest on new television
programming to their devoted readers.
</P>
<P>
   The annual July version begins Wednesday and ends on the 26th _
a 19-day run of news conferences and luncheons designed to induce
homesickness while affording us ``access'' to the people we'll all
be complaining about in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   _ The granting of so much face time with the stars supports the
theory that critics tend to submit kinder, gentler copy when
they're personally acquainted with the people they write about.
Because of certain anatomical considerations, it's not possible to
get too close to Pamela Anderson, so if I ever say something nice
about ``V.I.P.,'' the latest in Anderson's body of work, please
ascribe it to something more than our, uh, eyes having met across a
crowded hotel ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   The former ``Baywatch'' lifeguard is among the big names being
trotted out today by the companies that syndicate ``first-run''
programs so local stations across the country can fill all the time
slots not occupied by network stuff.
</P>
<P>
   First-run syndication means original material, such as
``Pensacola: Wings of Gold'' or ``Xena: Warrior Princess,'' as
opposed to syndicated reruns of previously original network
programming such as ``Seinfeld'' or ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who has bothered to watch ``The Adventures of Sinbad''
can tell you, first-run doesn't necessarily equal first-rate. The
budgets for syndicated shows are usually much lower than for
network series, and the cheesiness is often readily apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is still out on Anderson's ``V.I.P.'' Screening tapes
weren't available Another safe bet: ``V.I.P'' will be
fabric-challenged. I'll have more (or less) on Pamela tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   _ From two documentaries on the Cold War (a 24-hour marathon on
CNN, a more condensed version on The History Channel) to a remake
of ``Fantasy Island'' (Saturdays on ABC), the fall-TV lineup runs
the usual gamut.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't seen much of the cable fare yet, but some new network
shows that have made an early impression: ``Cupid'' and ``Sports
Night'' on ABC, ``Felicity'' on The WB, ``Will &AMP; Grace'' on NBC and
``Seven Days'' on UPN. More on all of these as I settle in for the
long pull at the Ritz.

CITIES HOPE TO SCORE WITH ALL-STAR GAME 
</HEADLINE>

 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he saw two dozen stretch limousines pull up outside of
Coors Field in Denver, Steve Sabitini became convinced Major League
Baseball's All-Star Game was more than just a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all lined up at the curb, and the doors opened up, and it
was all owners of major league teams, some Hall of Famers and all
kinds of big shots from companies,'' said Sabatini, who saw the
procession while working across the street from the stadium as a
waiter at the Brekenridge Brewing Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up watching games in Fenway Park, and this is really a
historic event, here,'' said Sabatini, a self-styled baseball guru.
``But it's also brought a lot of money into town _ lots of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it has. According to tourist and hospitality industry
officials in several major cities, the showcase of Major League
Baseball's most &UR;  &LR; luminous stars has spurred spending of $28 million
to $38.5 million annually in recent years. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Denver have prepared feverishly, eyeing an even
higher payout.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, which will host the 1999 All-Star game, planning is
already well under way. &UR;  &LR; The Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors
Bureau projects the city will realize at least $40 million in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big economic boost for the city, it's not just an
All-Star game,'' said Mayor Thomas Menino, who is in Denver to meet
with Mayor Wellington Webb and his staff for advice on hosting the
event. ``In Cleveland two years ago, it attracted 120,000 people,
and Boston is a more attractive destination. So we ought to do
better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the revenue from tourism, baseball's All-Star game
provides a huge civic marketing opportunity. Hundreds of officials
from major corporations and their favored customers fly from across
the country to attend the game and the large, staged events that
now envelop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, in terms of the convention and tourist
industry perspective, it'll be another way to show the country and
the world what Boston is, and what we can do,'' said Patrick B.
Moscaritolo, president and chief executive of the Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Colorado Rockies and the Red Sox, the local
tourist industries, and the city governments in Denver and Boston
all say they have had to forge a well-coordinated master plan for
both All-Star Games.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball provides a 28-page list of items that the
host franchise and city must accomplish _ everything from how to
decorate the field and the ballpark to how corporate sponsors of
the game may use and display the ``marks'' of Major League Baseball
and the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Denver and the Rockies have amassed 1,200 to 1,500 volunteers
serving as hospitality agents in the airport, hotels, restaurants,
information areas and at the ballpark. They are guiding the 100,000
to 150,000 visitors _ two to three times the capacity of Coors
Field _ to the myriad of events that form what Major League
Baseball likes to call ``All-Star Week.'' A similar number of
volunteers will be sought in Boston next July.
</P>
<P>
   Events began officially on Friday &UR;  &LR; last week, but many of the
businessmen and team owners were in Denver as early as Wednesday,
when Sabatini stood and watched the line of limos roll up to the
ballpark. On Friday, Saturday &UR; , &LR;  and Sunday, tens of thousands of
fans attended The All-Star FanFest at the Colorado Convention
Center. The FanFest is an amalgam of events and displays arrayed
around 300,000 square feet of indoor space that take fans on an
extensive, often-interactive tour of the sport. Because far more
fans attend All-Star week than can fit into Coors Field or Fenway
Park, FanFest and other ancillary events now provide nearly as much
of an attraction for visitors as the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got races, and throwing skills, batting, it has displays
about how gloves are made _ on and on. It's terrific,'' &UR;  &LR; said Red
Sox spokesman Richard L. Bresciani, describing FanFest. ``In
Boston, this thing should attract 125,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Major League Baseball has been &UR;  &LR;  an enormous business
success in Denver, driving &UR;  &LR;  the dramatic revitalization of the
oldest section of the city _ the so-called LoDo (Lower Downtown)
district, where Coors Field and about 85 restaurants and
microbreweries, 20 art galleries and 500 loft apartments have
opened in the once-abandoned warehouse district.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout LoDo Friday through game night Tuesday, restaurants
and bars have been rented out by companies sponsoring private
parties for employees and customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all psyched up,'' said Sabatini, who helped play host to
MasterCard, which rented out the Breckenridge Brewing Co. for a
party featuring the club's microbrews and barbeque and pub food.
``We close three days a year: Memorial Day, Christmas Day and New
Year's Day. But we're going to close down for MasterCard.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks further into the LoDo and away from Coors Field,
The Denver Post is sponsoring a party Tuesday for employees and
readers at the Wynkoop Brew Co. The Post and the Rocky Mountain
News compete for the hearts of Rockies fans as they compete for
readers. While the News is an official sponsor of the team, the
Post likes to call itself ``the official sponsor of the fans.'' The
Wynkoop was prepared to handle more than 1,000 people at the Post's
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta love any event that happens early in the week, if
you are a restaurant,'' said Matt McAleer, the Wynkoop's marketing
director. ``And the All-Star game is always on a Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver officials say they hope all of this secures the future of
LoDo. The refurbishment of the area has sparkled since Coors Field
opened, in part because of spillover parking. Planners
intentionally provided parking for only 5,000 cars near the field,
so fans park along the streets in LoDo, often eating dinner before
games and stopping in for a nightcap afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hot now,'' said Eugene Dilbeck, president and chief
executive of the Denver Metro Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. ``This
week it is the focus of national attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday was MCI All-Star Workout Day, with the long-distance
carrier spending a tidy sum to sponsor the day and other companies
paying to sponsor individual events, including the Fleer Diamond
Skills National Finals, the MCI All-Star hitting challenge and the
Service Merchandise Home Run Derby. All of the money from Workout
Day goes to charity, with Major League Baseball and the host
franchise splitting the donations 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver Monday many fans who could not obtain tickets to the
game tried instead for tickets to Workout Day. In fact, with Fenway
Park's limited capacity, there is a possibility Workout Day will be
close to a sellout next year. And because both stadiums are
considered sluggers' parks _ Coors Field because of the thin air at
the high altitude, and Fenway because of its cozy confines _ the
home run competition is especially popular with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 people gathered Monday night at the Denver
Performing Arts Complex for the All-Star Gala, featuring food,
drink and entertainment, and another 5,000 fans were expected at
the Major League Baseball Pre-Game Celebration on Tuesday &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Boston are already preparing for many of the same
events for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bresciani says the Red Sox have sent 25 employees to Denver to
help them conceptualize what the team must do in and around Fenway
Park next July. The All-Star Game has not been played at Fenway
Park since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Moscaritolo and a member of his staff, and Robert V. Colarossi,
president of the Massachusetts Sports Partnership, are all joining
Menino in Denver in anticipation of the work that lies ahead to
prepare Boston for next year's event.
</P>
<P>
   Moscaritolo says 18 hotels already have been assembled in Boston
to provide 14,000 hotel rooms, and he and Bresciani say the hunt is
on for venues large enough to host many of the ancillary events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already gearing up to provide a really first-class
experience,'' Moscaritolo said.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Edward Burns arrived in Ireland last summer to begin
filming ``Saving Private Ryan,'' he was feeling pretty good _ if
not downright cocky.
</P>
<P>
   Who could blame him? He had just wrapped his third movie as
writer, director and star, and Steven Spielberg had cast him in the
World War II epic without an audition.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Burns had landed the part of a wisecracking soldier
without so much as taking a meeting with the most powerful man in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   His first day on the set went off without a hitch. It was the
second day that knocked the wind out of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, it was absolutely terrifying,'' Burns
remembers. ``It was this big, long scene with me and Tom Hanks
going toe to toe. I had to sort of get in his face. We did a bunch
of takes, and it was great, and I felt really good, and then Steven
said, `I want to try one more angle.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing the take, and it's going great, and I forget my
line near the end of the scene, and I think, 'Oh damn,''' he
continues. ``We do it again, and I screw up the line. Now, I see
Steven's concerned because we're running out of light, and then it
hits me: Oh my god, that's Steven Spielberg, this is Tom Hanks, and
I'm screwing up.''
</P>
<P>
   On take three, Burns choked again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanks was just like, 'Eddie, calm down. You can do this,''' he
says. ``And then it was fine. I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns likes to joke that watching Spielberg at work on ``Saving
Private Ryan'' was his graduate degree in film.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was feeling like I knew anything about filmmaking,'' he
says, ``that sort of woke me up to how much I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three years since he became an instant sensation at the
Sundance Film Festival _ shocking the movie industry by taking home
the Grand jury Prize for his debut film, ``The Brothers McMullen''
_ Burns has parlayed the hype into a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brothers McMullen,'' shot for a paltry $25,000, went on to
gross more than $10 million, making it, percentage-wise at least,
the most profitable movie of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 30-year-old actor has filmed ``She's the One,''
a kind of McMullen redux with one fewer brother and a $3 million
budget, and ``No Looking Back,'' about a 30-ish diner waitress
trapped in a small Northeastern shore town and torn between her
sweet-tempered boyfriend (Jon Bon Jovi) and her no-good ex (Burns).
</P>
<P>
   Edward Burns grew up on Long Island, the son of a New York City
cop. (He's Eddie to his friends _ Screen Actors Guild has been on
his back about press references to ``Ed Burns,'' a name already
phonetically spoken for by 1960s TV actor Edd Byrnes of ``77 Sunset
Strip.'')
</P>
<P>
   When his NBA dreams didn't pan out _ he still has the thin,
squeaky voice of a kid calling plays in a schoolyard game _ Burns
enrolled in SUNY Albany, thinking maybe he'd become a sportswriter.
</P>
<P>
   Never a movie buff, he was hooked by a film-appreciation course
he took for an easy A. Burns later transferred to Hunter College in
New York City, unable to afford the more prestigious film schools.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a tale that has become modern-day movie lore, he spent
four years doing grunt work on ``Entertainment Tonight'' while
writing screenplays in his down time and piling up rejection
letters from agents and producers.
</P>
<P>
   He was close to quitting when his dad offered the seed money to
make ``The Brothers McMullen,'' which he shot over the course of
eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack (Mulcahy, who played the oldest brother) was the only guy
who had been in front of a camera before,'' Burns says.
</P>
<P>
   What followed were more rejection letters, this time from film
festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, he thrust a tape into the hands of Robert Redford _
the godfather of indie films _ after an ``ET'' interview. It was
the only time, Burns says, that he hit up a celebrity at work. Even
that approach failed.
</P>
<P>
   But by coincidence, Redford's Sundance accepted Burns'
submission. Only later _ after Burns won the top prize, Fox
Searchlight bought the picture and Redford called to congratulate
the young filmmaker _ did Burns remind the venerable actor/director
of their earlier meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Redford has since become his mentor, serving as executive
producer on his last two movies.
</P>
<P>
   For ``No Looking Back,'' Burns had a budget of $5 million _ more
than he was used to, but still far less than what your average
mega-star commands for one picture.
</P>
<P>
   He says he spent the extra cash on ``five more days of shooting,
my first crane shot and a rain machine for an afternoon. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I made less than half of what I made on `She's the One,'''
he adds.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns says that was an easy price to pay for the opportunity
to make the ``tough little drama'' he wanted. Besides, he says,
``When you make a film for five, they leave you alone. Working with
a lower budget just gives you more freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as shooting was to begin on his next film, ``No Looking
Back,'' Burns split from his girlfriend of eight years, Maxine
Bahns. Their relationship had become part of the Burns mythology:
They met working in a restaurant in the Hamptons, lived in his car
that summer and had been inseparable ever since. He had even cast
her, with no acting training, in his first two movies.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit for their breakup, he says, was not success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just Max and I were together such a long time, and it
was a case of, was either of us ready to get married?'' he says.
``I certainly wasn't ready to say OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Bahns left the picture, Holly entered it. But
Burns denies having an on-the-set romance with his leading lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' he smirks, ``Jon and I were having the affair.''
</P>
<P>
   He remains cagey about his relationship with Holly, calling the
two of them ``really good friends, underline really.''
</P>
<P>
   Since finishing ``No Looking Back,'' Burns has been working on
the script of ``The Long Blue Line,'' the story of an
Irish-American cop family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm passionate about my heritage,'' he says, admitting he's on
a quest to become the Irish-American Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford
Coppola, Woody Allen and Spike Lee.

<P>
   Again he intends to direct and star in the movie. At heart he
considers himself a writer, but he has always been afraid ``to
surrender (a script) to someone and let them potentially massacre
my vision,'' he says. ``I wanted control of it. So directing was
just an extension of my writing.''
</P>
<P>
   He began acting for the same reason _ to maintain control of his
own work. ``Saving Private Ryan,'' in fact, was ``the first time I
ever uttered a line of dialog that I didn't write.''
</P>
<P>
   He has never taken an acting class and doesn't have a coach. But
with his strong features and easy manner, he seems a natural for
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach is from the gut,'' he says, ``and I guess it's
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns says he would gladly act again in someone else's movie,
particularly if it pays well _ eliminating the need to earn money
from his own films.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has already made more money than he expected to earn
in a lifetime, Burns insists his daily fife hasn't changed much. He
still rents an apartment _ he swears it isn't much bigger than his
last one _ and he hangs out at the same neighborhood bar and plays
basketball with the same guys.
</P>
<P>
   But he does eat out more often.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the clout he has gained, allowing him to hobnob
with his heroes, from Spielberg, Redford and Hanks to Tom Petty and
Bruce Springsteen, and to form Irish Twins Productions with his
younger brother, Brian. They co-created a sitcom, ``These Are the
Days,'' for ABC and are now developing a one-hour drama for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Keenly aware that he is only three short years removed from his
peonship at ``Entertainment Tonight,'' Burns is savoring every
minute of his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't work _ I make movies,'' he says. ``Ten years from now
I might be working in a diner.'' &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Edward Burns arrived in Ireland last summer to begin
filming ``Saving Private Ryan,'' he was feeling pretty good _ if
not downright cocky.
</P>
<P>
   Who could blame him? He had just wrapped his third movie as
writer, director and star, and Steven Spielberg had cast him in the
World War II epic without an audition.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Burns had landed the part of a wisecracking soldier
without so much as taking a meeting with the most powerful man in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   His first day on the set went off without a hitch. It was the
second day that knocked the wind out of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, it was absolutely terrifying,'' Burns
remembers. ``It was this big, long scene with me and Tom Hanks
going toe to toe. I had to sort of get in his face. We did a bunch
of takes, and it was great, and I felt really good, and then Steven
said, `I want to try one more angle.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing the take, and it's going great, and I forget my
line near the end of the scene, and I think, 'Oh damn,''' he
continues. ``We do it again, and I screw up the line. Now, I see
Steven's concerned because we're running out of light, and then it
hits me: Oh my god, that's Steven Spielberg, this is Tom Hanks, and
I'm screwing up.''
</P>
<P>
   On take three, Burns choked again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanks was just like, 'Eddie, calm down. You can do this,''' he
says. ``And then it was fine. I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns likes to joke that watching Spielberg at work on ``Saving
Private Ryan'' was his graduate degree in film.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was feeling like I knew anything about filmmaking,'' he
says, ``that sort of woke me up to how much I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three years since he became an instant sensation at the
Sundance Film Festival _ shocking the movie industry by taking home
the Grand jury Prize for his debut film, ``The Brothers McMullen''
_ Burns has parlayed the hype into a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brothers McMullen,'' shot for a paltry $25,000, went on to
gross more than $10 million, making it, percentage-wise at least,
the most profitable movie of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 30-year-old actor has filmed ``She's the One,''
a kind of McMullen redux with one fewer brother and a $3 million
budget, and ``No Looking Back,'' about a 30-ish diner waitress
trapped in a small Northeastern shore town and torn between her
sweet-tempered boyfriend (Jon Bon Jovi) and her no-good ex (Burns).
</P>
<P>
   Edward Burns grew up on Long Island, the son of a New York City
cop. (He's Eddie to his friends _ Screen Actors Guild has been on
his back about press references to ``Ed Burns,'' a name already
phonetically spoken for by 1960s TV actor Edd Byrnes of ``77 Sunset
Strip.'')
</P>
<P>
   When his NBA dreams didn't pan out _ he still has the thin,
squeaky voice of a kid calling plays in a schoolyard game _ Burns
enrolled in SUNY Albany, thinking maybe he'd become a sportswriter.
</P>
<P>
   Never a movie buff, he was hooked by a film-appreciation course
he took for an easy A. Burns later transferred to Hunter College in
New York City, unable to afford the more prestigious film schools.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a tale that has become modern-day movie lore, he spent
four years doing grunt work on ``Entertainment Tonight'' while
writing screenplays in his down time and piling up rejection
letters from agents and producers.
</P>
<P>
   He was close to quitting when his dad offered the seed money to
make ``The Brothers McMullen,'' which he shot over the course of
eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack (Mulcahy, who played the oldest brother) was the only guy
who had been in front of a camera before,'' Burns says.
</P>
<P>
   What followed were more rejection letters, this time from film
festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, he thrust a tape into the hands of Robert Redford _
the godfather of indie films _ after an ``ET'' interview. It was
the only time, Burns says, that he hit up a celebrity at work. Even
that approach failed.
</P>
<P>
   But by coincidence, Redford's Sundance accepted Burns'
submission. Only later _ after Burns won the top prize, Fox
Searchlight bought the picture and Redford called to congratulate
the young filmmaker _ did Burns remind the venerable actor/director
of their earlier meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Redford has since become his mentor, serving as executive
producer on his last two movies.
</P>
<P>
   For ``No Looking Back,'' Burns had a budget of $5 million _ more
than he was used to, but still far less than what your average
mega-star commands for one picture.
</P>
<P>
   He says he spent the extra cash on ``five more days of shooting,
my first crane shot and a rain machine for an afternoon. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I made less than half of what I made on `She's the One,'''
he adds.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns says that was an easy price to pay for the opportunity
to make the ``tough little drama'' he wanted. Besides, he says,
``When you make a film for five, they leave you alone. Working with
a lower budget just gives you more freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as shooting was to begin on his next film, ``No Looking
Back,'' Burns split from his girlfriend of eight years, Maxine
Bahns. Their relationship had become part of the Burns mythology:
They met working in a restaurant in the Hamptons, lived in his car
that summer and had been inseparable ever since. He had even cast
her, with no acting training, in his first two movies.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit for their breakup, he says, was not success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just Max and I were together such a long time, and it
was a case of, was either of us ready to get married?'' he says.
``I certainly wasn't ready to say OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Bahns left the picture, Holly entered it. But
Burns denies having an on-the-set romance with his leading lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' he smirks, ``Jon and I were having the affair.''
</P>
<P>
   He remains cagey about his relationship with Holly, calling the
two of them ``really good friends, underline really.''
</P>
<P>
   Since finishing ``No Looking Back,'' Burns has been working on
the script of ``The Long Blue Line,'' the story of an
Irish-American cop family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm passionate about my heritage,'' he says, admitting he's on
a quest to become the Irish-American Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford
Coppola, Woody Allen and Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Again he intends to direct and star in the movie. At heart he
considers himself a writer, but he has always been afraid ``to
surrender (a script) to someone and let them potentially massacre
my vision,'' he says. ``I wanted control of it. So directing was
just an extension of my writing.''
</P>
<P>
   He began acting for the same reason _ to maintain control of his
own work. ``Saving Private Ryan,'' in fact, was ``the first time I
ever uttered a line of dialog that I didn't write.''
</P>
<P>
   He has never taken an acting class and doesn't have a coach. But

production crops of 110,000 tons and more are possible over the

   FLORIDA-CARIBBEAN (Miami) _ On a blistering South Florida
afternoon whose heat approximates a restaurant kitchen's, Norman
Van Aken, dressed from chin to cuffs in his white chef's outfit,
looks refreshed and cool as he cuts a path through sweaty shoppers
inside the Palacio de los Jugos market. It looks less than regal,
but for Van Aken, the fresh fruits and vegetables shipped here
daily from the Caribbean, Latin America and other tropical lands
represent the raw material for dishes fit for gastronomic royalty.
Van Aken is the head chef and partner in Norman's in nearby Coral
Gables, which is widely considered the best restaurant in South
Florida. A pioneer in the Florida-Caribbean fusion cooking that he
calls New World cuisine, Van Aken is perhaps the best known of the
Miami chefs collectively called ``The Mango Gang.'' By Jon

her back and made her dangling silver earrings sparkle. But the
56-year-old Chilean novelist was, for the moment, immune to the
poetry and the pleasure of the spring sun. Bent in her own shadow,
calibrating the flame under the omelet pan on her stove, Ms.
Allende, had surrendered to an atavistic ritual of the kind that
might have made a scene in one of her novels. By Molly O'Neill.

CALIFORNIA JUDICIAL PANEL CRITICIZES APPELLATE JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The panel that disciplines California judges has
charged a Court of Appeal judge with misconduct in an extraordinary
attack that has alarmed the legal community and raised questions
about free speech in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Judicial Performance on Monday accused Justice
J. Anthony Kline of contradicting the state Supreme Court in a
written opinion. It was an unprecedented move that could lead to
Kline's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based commission said Kline had issued a
dissenting opinion Dec. 2, 1997, in a San Mateo County
landlord-tenant dispute centering on a point of law decided five
years earlier by the California Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Kline said he believed the state's highest court had been wrong
and that he couldn't follow its ruling ``as a matter of
conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   The specific issue involved what observers described as a matter
of legal philosophy: whether opponents in civil lawsuits may ignore
judgments of trial courts and reach financial settlements in
blatant disregard of those courts.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a ``stipulated reversal,'' this action was upheld in a
1992 state Supreme Court case, Neary vs. Regents of the University
of California. It has been upheld by no other court, including the
U.S. Supreme Court, which expressly rejected it in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In a strongly worded letter to the commission March 13, Kline
laid out his position. The letter said stipulated reversals wrongly
permitted parties ``with the necessary economic means to purchase
the reversal of an adverse judgment'' and undermined the integrity
of the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Such post-trial collaborations, he said, convert court judgments
``into a commodity that can be bought and sold.''
</P>
<P>
   He protested that the commission was trying to punish him for
``forthrightness and candor'' in his attempt to persuade the state
Supreme Court to reconsider the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the 11-member commission, a politically appointed body
composed mostly of non-lawyers named during the administration of
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, said Kline had engaged in ``willful
misconduct ... that brings the judicial office into disrepute.''
</P>
<P>
   It said he had violated canons of the state Code of Judicial
Ethics barring actions that did not promote ``public confidence''
in the courts and requiring that a judge be ``faithful to the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the legal community condemned judicial
panel's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an outrage,'' said Stephen Barnett, professor of law at
the University of California at Berkeley. ``It shows the commission
doesn't know the difference between misconduct and an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed,'' said David Heilbron, former State Bar president.
``There's never been a charge like this pursued by the
commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Former appeals judge and commission chairman John Racanelli said
he shared Kline's legal view and was ``surprised and distressed''
that the disciplinary panel would examine a written opinion
``through the lens of conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Kline, 59, declined to comment on the charges, but said he would
hire a lawyer.

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; BE SWEET &QL; 
 &UR; Roy Blount Jr. (Knopf, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Talk to any humorist, and you will hear the same refrain: In his
heart of hearts, he'll tell you, he is not funny. In his heart of
hearts, he's sad. Fans of Blount's intelligent, antic humor will
have to make some adjustments as they read this memoir, because
much of it deals with Blount's difficult relationship with his
mother, and the subsequent ``sefflo'' _ a humorist's shorthand for
self-loathing _ that is at the heart of his desire to make people
laugh. The passages in which Blount tells of his resentment toward
his mother and his lifelong inability to understand her are not
terribly convincing. They often sound like emotional baggage that a
56-year-old man should long since have put down. His book also has
a tendency to become disjointed as he rushes headlong out of a
particularly dark passage into a hilarious dissertation on, say,
meeting up with Daryl Hannah in a public restroom. What saves it is
Blount's superb comic sense _ when he's on, there's no one better _
and his affable persona, even when he's talking about ex-wives,
difficult childbirth and matricidal guilt. This is a book worth
reading, but not the book you expect it to be. &QL;

 &UR; KYKUIT: THE ROCKEFELLER FAMILY HOME &QL; 
 &UR; Ann Rockefeller Roberts (Abbeville, $49.95)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Abbeville has been waiting in the wings, knowing how
prudent it would be to publish this coffee-table book on the heels
of Ron Chernow's ``Titan,'' a wonderful biography of John D.
Rockefeller Sr. that was released last month to glowing reviews.
Ann Rockefeller Roberts is the great-granddaughter of ``JDR,'' as
she calls him, and her daughter, Mary Louise Pierson, contributed
photographs of the estate as it is today. Construction of the house
was overseen by JDR's son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., on behalf of
his parents, and it was all he could do to coax his frugal father
through the shock of rising costs and the inadequacy of their
original estimates of the price of house and grounds. After years
of renovation (JDR and his wife were unhappy with the first
version), the house was finished in 1913, 20 years after JDR
purchased the land. A few minor details later _ JDR paid $700,000
to reroute the New York Central Railroad, which cut across the
estate _ it became the family home, including a farm that supplied
produce and spring water (JDR became so fond of the produce that it
was shipped to him wherever he went). This is an elegant look at
the house and its holdings _ artworks, outbuildings, gymnasium,
bowling alley and an ``automobile hall'' for the family cars. &QL;

 &UR; MEDITATIONS FROM A MOVABLE CHAIR &QL; 
 &UR; Andre Dubus (Knopf, $23)
</P>
<P>
   ``My imagination gave me a dual life: I lived in my body, and at
the same time lived a life no one could see,'' Dubus writes. ``All
my life, I have told myself stories, and have talked in my mind to
friends.'' This collection of essays begins on a somber note, but
not, as you might expect, with the story of why Dubus is in his
movable chair (12 years ago he was hit by a car, losing one leg and
the use of the other). Instead, he begins with the night when his
sister, Kathryn, was sexually assaulted by a stranger on the yard
behind her house while her daughter waited for her inside,
oblivious to what was happening. There is nothing overly dramatic
about this essay. These are, after all, meditations, and although
several deal with tragedy, they also share something strong and
life-affirming in the steady, trustworthy voice of Andre Dubus.
It's a wonderful sound, no less so when the stories it tells are
true. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; FUN ALONG THE ROAD &QL; 
 &UR; John Margolies (Bulfinch, $29.95)
</P>
<P>
   We have perused every tourist attraction in this book, and have
decided that we want to go to Hayward, Wis., to visit the National
Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame, where there is a fiberglass muskie
that stands four and a half stories high, with an entrance on its
underbelly and a railing in its gaping mouth to keep you from
falling to your death on a trash can below. There are other fish
statues, too, all open-mouthed, larger than life and deeply ugly.
Margolies goes looking for this type of thing. We cannot tell you
what his motives are, except to sell books and make a record of the
endangered kitsch by the side of the road. His book is pricey, and
could be more informative. There's only a photo and one short
caption on that big muskie. It deserves more. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; EXILES &QL; 
 &UR; Philip Caputo (Vintage, $13)
</P>
<P>
   New in paperback is this collection of three novellas by the
author of the Vietnam memoir ``A Rumor of War.'' The best is ``In
the Forest of the Laughing Elephant,'' a Conradian tale of men
pitted against nature in a far, exotic place. They are soldiers on
the edge of the action in the Vietnam War, and their leader, an
otherworldly man named Lincoln Coombs, forces them deeper and
deeper into the jungle in search of a tiger that has snatched one
of his men. As their quest becomes increasingly menacing, Coombs
becomes demented in his determination to find and kill the animal
that, unbeknown to the other men, has shamed him. Caputo's prose is
rich and assertive, but it never dominates the events that it
describes. Things (begin itals) happen (end itals) in these
stories, in the tradition of tales told on the edge of a campfire.
That's the best kind of fiction of all. &QL;

SONDHEIM KNEW HIS CALLING EARLY ON

Stephen Sondheim: A Life 
Meryle Secrest (Alfred A. Knopf, $30) 
 
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   God must love the American musical theater. At the moment of its
greatest decline, its greatest composer/lyricist arrived as
recompense.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Sondheim was living the unremarkable life of a
10-year-old New York boy in 1940 when his father left his mother,
starting the chain of events that would lead to the scores for
``Company,'' ``Follies,'' ``A Little Night Music,'' ``Sweeney
Todd,'' ``Into the Woods,'' and the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Sunday
in the Park With George,'' among many others.
</P>
<P>
   Left to raise her son alone, Foxy Sondheim botched the job,
turning her only child into a receptacle for her guilt, having him
mix drinks for all-night parties and even, on several occasions,
attempting thinly veiled seductions. Of course, little Stevie grew
up afraid of women and emotionally frigid.
</P>
<P>
   He also grew up around Oscar Hammerstein II, and that made all
the difference. The Pennsylvania farm where Hammerstein lived with
his family became a refuge for young Steve, who lived with his
mother nearby. The librettist/lyricist of ``Show Boat'' and
``Oklahoma!'' became a substitute father, a role model, and Steve
wanted to be just like him. ``If he had been an anthropologist, I
would've been an anthropologist,'' Sondheim has said elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the field that needed his singular talents. As
Meryle Secrest points out in her throughly researched and vividly
written biogra phy _ the first of the man most consider the world's
most important living composer for the stage _ Sondheim's life has
been fiercely devoted to his art, to the exclusion of every
possible distraction. Committed personal relationships have been
few and late-blooming. Disciplines irrelevant to a relatively
narrow artistic focus have been ignored. Composer Ned Rorem once
noted with a puzzled air that Sondheim has never mastered
orchestration or French, though he obviously has the intelligence
for both. The reason seems obvious: Broadway composers don't
orchestrate, and they don't write in French. Why spend energy that
could be used on more pertinent things, such as the next score?
</P>
<P>
   Excluded, too, has been any attempt at popularity for its own
sake. From the moment in 1945 when he wept openly at the opening
night of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ``Carousel,'' Sondheim has
viewed the musical as a form ripe with serious potential. He's
followed that vision even while the world has gone in the other
direction. Secrest quotes one Broadway professional as saying that,
to succeed today, musicals must have lots of special effects, a
simplistic book, and a rock-influenced pop score. It is not
surprising that Sondheim's musicals, ranging in subject matter from
the nature of art to the Westernization of Japan, and written in
styles influenced by an assortment of 20th-century Classical
composers (Ravel in ``Night Music,'' Britten in ``Sunday,'' etc.),
have overwhelmingly failed as financial ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim's ambition from the start was to write both music and
lyrics, and he showed extraordinary early promise in both areas.
After attending Williams College, where he was regarded as a fine
actor as well as musician, Sondheim studied with Milton Babbitt, an
avant-garde composer and disciple of Arnold Schoenberg. Babbitt was
a perfect fit because he harbored a secret life: that of a
frustrated Broadway songwriter. Sondheim, with ambitions to be a
tonal Broadway composer, became the unlikeliest artistic grandchild
of Schoenberg, the most feared name in early 20th-century
avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   But it was as lyricist only that Sondheim first broke through,
in two of the most successful musicals of the late 1950s: ``West
Side Story'' (music by Leonard Bernstein) and ``Gypsy'' (to Jule
Styne's music). Though 1962 brought his first music-and-lyrics
credit, ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' it
would be decades before the general public thought of Sondheim as a
composer. (``Forum'' would also supply him with his main source of
income for many years.)
</P>
<P>
   Written with Sondheim's cooperation and rumored in advance to be
a ``tell-all'' biography, Secrest's book is pleasingly free of the
sort of detailed intimate information that is irrelevant to any
real discussion of art and artist, though it is often the stuff of
bestselling celebrity bios. She treats her subject's private life
openly but with respect, from his early suspicions of being
homosexual to his attempts at forging heterosexual relationships
(with Mary Rodgers, composer and daughter of Richard, and actress
Lee Remick, among others), his slow process of self-accommodation
beginning in the '70s, and the first time he fell in love _ at the
probably record-breaking age of 61.
</P>
<P>
   These and other personal matters, including Sondheim's famous
enthusiasm for games and his less well-known star-struck side (he
followed Bogart around the set of ``Beat the Devil''), are explored
with reference to their impact on Sondheim's work, which is the
real subject here. Generally, Secrest's observations make good
sense, such as her connection of ``The Ladies Who Lunch'' from
``Company'' to the personality of Sondheim's mother, and of
``Finishing the Hat'' from ``Sunday'' to Sondheim's own loneliness.
Once in a while, as when she tries to relate Sondheim's excitement
over a performance of ``Someone in a Tree'' from ``Pacific
Overtures'' to his childhood, the link can seem a tendentious
stretch. ``Tree'' is probably Sondheim's favorite song simply
because it is the most unusual song from a most unusual score.
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim's musicals are testament to what the musical might have
been following the innovations of Rodgers and Hammerstein in the
1940s and the heyday of the musical in the 1950s. They still point
the way to a possible future. New operas, at least the ones seen by
this writer, are looking increasingly bleak. Opera turns 400 this
year; the modern musical is less than quarter that age. The lyric
stage might well profit by a shift from opera's emphasis on
vocal-display-as-expression to the emphasis on dramatic song in the
Sondheim musical. &QL;

SEEDS OF WOMEN'S MOVEMENT BEGAN IN UPSTATE NEW YORK VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATE GURNETT  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SENECA FALLS, N.Y. _ When Elizabeth Cady Stanton strode to the
speaker's podium at the first-ever woman's rights assembly, she was
surrounded by friends and fellow reformers among the 300 people who
packed the Wesleyan Chapel in Seneca Falls, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she was alone.
</P>
<P>
   Only Stanton was pushing to add voting rights for women to the
agenda. Quaker leader Lucretia Mott advised against it. Henry
Stanton left town when he learned what his wife was planning. Her
father questioned her sanity. Stanton was reaching beyond her
grasp. And hoping to ignite a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1848, elective franchise for women was considered sheer
lunacy. But Stanton had embodied a feminist perspective since
childhood. The death of her only brother at age 10 had crystallized
her inferior status. Near the casket in their large, dark parlor,
she climbed onto the knee of her pale and immovable father.
</P>
<P>
   ``At length he heaved a sigh and said: `Oh, my daughter, I wish
you were a boy!' Throwing my arms about his neck I replied, `I will
try to be all my brother was,' she would later recall.
</P>
<P>
   By 1848 Stanton was passionately provoked by inequities that
banned half the population from voting, holding public office,
attending college, preaching or expressing opinions at social
gatherings. In this ``tempest-tossed condition of mind'' she opted
to launch the first projectile in a battle that would take 72
years.
</P>
<P>
   The 150th anniversary of the Women's Rights Convention will be
marked with several days of upcoming events, including a speech
July 16 by Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the National Women's Hall of Fame will induct 21
people whose lives demonstrate how far women have come in politics,
the professions and family life.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton's journey to Seneca Falls started in Johnstown, 40 miles
west of Albany. The day she was born _ Nov. 12, 1815 _ her father,
Daniel Cady, was elected to Congress. As a girl she loved to dance
and sleigh. After the death of her brother Eleazar, she added, with
her own initiative, mathematics, Greek, economics and equestrian
feats.
</P>
<P>
   When her classmates went on to Union College in Schenectady,
Stanton was excluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vexation and mortification knew no bounds,'' she recalled
in her autobiography, ``Eighty Years &AMP; More'' (1898). She convinced
her father to send her to women's education pioneer Emma Willard's
female seminary in Troy.
</P>
<P>
   While the 1830s ``cult of true womanhood'' popularized in
magazines limited a woman's sphere to the home, family and church,
law school would have been more in keeping with Stanton's feisty
and argumentative character. As a young girl she watched a parade
of penniless female clients arrive at her father's law office door,
powerless over the state law that left husbands' estates to their
sons, not wives.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Elizabeth vowed to cut the cruel laws from her father's
legal books with a pair of scissors. Daniel Cady advised her to
lobby the state Legislature when she grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus was the future object of my life foreshadowed,'' Stanton
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   From her abolitionist cousin Gerrit Smith, an 1848 presidential
candidate, to her Boston social contacts with abolitionists
Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison and writer Ralph
Waldo Emerson, she was encircled by radical thinkers. In 1840 she
married abolitionist Henry Stanton (she edited ``obey'' from the
traditional vows). They honeymooned in London at an anti-slavery
convention, traveling with Quaker abolitionists James Mott and his
wife, Lucretia Mott, founder of Philadelphia's Women's Anti-Slavery
Society in Philadelphia. When the male delegates banned female
delegate participation, Stanton and Mott were outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really pitiful to hear narrow-minded bigots, pretending
to be teachers and leaders of men, so cruelly remanding their own
mothers, with the rest of woman-kind, to absolute subjection to the
ordinary masculine type of humanity,'' Stanton later wrote. She and
Mott decided then to hold a women's rights convention back in the
States.
</P>
<P>
   It took eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The air was rife with reform sentiments by the time Mott and
Stanton met again in 1848 in Seneca Falls. Stanton had moved to the
mill village of about 4,000 people the year before with her husband
and three children.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, some dubbed upstate New York from Utica to
Rochester the ``burned-over district'' due to the flames of
religious revivalism sweeping the area. As they left New England to
follow industry and the Erie Canal, ``Yankee Yorkers'' _ Yankees
who moved west to New York _ dropped such old beliefs as
predestination for newer notions of individual freedom and
community responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical preachers exhorted their mainly female audiences to
convert others, from drunks to slave owners. The villages around
Rochester provided natural great hiding places for runaway slaves
headed to Canada as well as activist abolitionists like the
Hicksite Quakers who relocated from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The area also spawned such religious movements as Mormonism and
spiritualism.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this foundry of reform that Stanton forged her
feminist artillery. Often, she was alone with three children while
her husband traveled making abolitionist speeches. Her own
frustrations mixed with small-town life and the domestic abuse and
economic oppression she witnessed just across the Seneca River in
the crowded, smelly factory town populated by Irish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1848, Lucretia Mott came to town for a Quaker
convention. At a tea party at the Waterloo home of Jane Hunt,
Stanton, then 32, poured out ``the torrent of my long-accumulating
discontent'' to her friends: Hunt, Mott, Mary Ann M'Clintock, and
Mott's sister, Martha Coffin Wright. Her rant inspired them to call
the meeting at the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Seneca Falls.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stanton died in 1902, 18 years before women got the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after the groundbreaking assembly at Seneca Falls,
Stanton remained the leading thinker in the women's movement. As
she raised seven children at her home in Seneca Falls, Stanton
wrote the speeches that her friend Susan B. Anthony, whom she met
in 1851, traveled the country to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stanton kept up a progressive domestic life,
constructing a gymnasium in the barn for her boys and girls,
teaching her sons kitchen skills, dancing, playing the piano and
hosting conversation nights for her many and varied guests.
</P>
<P>
   Long before most of her peers, Stanton advocated birth control,
girls' sports, equal pay, day care, coeducation, dress reform,
labor unions, divorce law, custody reform and cooperative kitchens.
She spoke publicly about her enjoyment of sex.
</P>
<P>
   From her public lectures to her speeches before the state
Legislature and relentless letters to editors, Stanton kept
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   As time went on, her radical stands and acerbic wit caused her
to lose friends and political support. She broke with abolitionists
who backed the 14th Amendment, which granted suffrage to former
male slaves in 1868, but not to women.
</P>
<P>
   Even after her death, Stanton's public image continued to erode
as the more prim and acceptable Anthony was elevated to represent
the suffrage struggle. But Stanton, the fiercer half of that
50-year partnership, is clearly the matriarch of the women's
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Passionately aware of the inequities, insistent and eloquent in
her advocacy and, often, courageously alone, she persevered.
</P>
<P>
   As Anthony put it: ``Cautious, careful people ... never can
bring about reform. Those who are really in earnest must be willing
to ... avow their sympathy with despised and persecuted ideas ...
and bear the consequences.''

</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-POP-MUSIC (Tokyo) _ For the past two decades, Japan has
been home to the world's largest music industry next to America,
but only recently _ in the face of economic crisis and sweeping
social changes _ has it reached the diversity and originality
necessary to propel its musicians in the West. By Neil Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DRAWING-SCHOOL (New York) _ When the drawing marathon at the New
York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture on a Monday
morning in mid-June, 97 artists, students, architects, Sunday
painters, art critics and teachers from Australia, Mexico,
Switzerland, England, Israel, the Philippines, California, Alabama,
Massachusetts, Washington, stood ready at their easels to draw for
eight hours a day, five days a week, in seven separate studios.
This biannual event, dreamed up 10 years ago by Graham Nickson, an
enigmatic, soft-spoken British painter who is the dean of the
school, seemed to be far better known outside New York than inside.
Few had come from close by. Many had traveled thousands of miles
for it. By Sarah Boxer.

<P>
   &UR; ARCHITECTURE  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GREAT-CITIES (Undated) _ Here is an urban theme and five
variations. D.W. Winnicott, the great British child psychoanalyst,
believed that artists are driven by the conflict between the desire
to communicate and the even stronger desire to hide. Flip this idea
around, and you arrive at a useful theory for interpreting the
contemporary city: Great cities are driven by the conflict between
the desire to expose and the even stronger desire to overlook. By
Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NOVELTIES-DANCE (New York) _ It was Sol Hurok, an impresario
with a keen eye on the box office, who grasped the ballet public's
hunger for what he called ``novelties.'' These were new
productions, mainly premieres but also revivals of works so rarely
seen that they took on the aura of a premiere. A prime example was
Hurok's historic presentation of a full-length ``Sleeping Beauty''
when the Sadler's Wells Ballet made its New York debut in 1949.
During their recent seasons, American Ballet Theater and New York
City Ballet each offered the same two kinds of ``novelties.'' Both
commissioned a new work and presented an unusual revival,
transferred from another company. By Anna Kisselgoff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LAFURA-DELSBAUS-THEATER (Barcelona) _ La Fura Del Baus is as
unusual a name in Catalan as it is in English: The Ferret from the
Baus. But there was method to the fantasy of the five young street
performers who chose the name of their new experimental theater
company in Barcelona in 1979. Today, La Fura dels Baus is
synonymous with an unorthodox multidisciplinary form of theater
that uses loud music, violent movement, bizarre machinery and
almost no words to create a near-apocalyptic atmosphere. By Alan
Riding.
</P>
<P>
   IRVING-CIDERHOUSE-THEATER (Los Angeles) _ When John Irving began
work on ``The Cider House Rules,'' his sprawling 1985 novel about
eight decades in the life of a rural Maine orphanage, he says he
had no intention of writing a wrenching polemic on abortion or, it
seems safe to say, a work that would be the basis for a 2-part,
6-hour marathon play with 22 actors portraying 120 characters in
150 scenes. But 13 years after the book's publication and 6 years
after a trio of theater professionals conceived the notion of
dramatizing it, ``The Cider House Rules'' has become all that and
more in a production of the same name that opened July 11 at the
Mark Taper Forum here and runs through Sept. 27. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER-BRAIN (New York) _ ``A New Brain,'' William Finn's
latest chamber opera, is the composer-lyricist's attempt to deal
with what was obviously a doomy, seriously traumatic experience:
the preliminary diagnosis of an inoperable brain tumor, which he
received in 1992 just two weeks after winning Tonys for his book
and score for ``Falsettos.'' By Vincent Canby.

<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-PRETEENS (Undated) _ Placing the pre- or early-adolescent
point of view in the thick of sophisticated conflict has a
venerable cinematic past, of course _ think of Truffaut's ``400
Blows'' and Spielberg's ``E.T.'' And its practical esthetic appeal
is a compelling one that's not so difficult to decipher: the pre-
or early adolescent is old enough to be both perceptive witness and
provocative participant yet young enough not to have retreated
fully behind the blinkers of self-contemplation and social
convention. By Will Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   ROMERO-HORROR-MOVIES (Undated) _ Released in 1985, ``Day of the
Dead'' is one of four Romero titles just reissued on video by
Anchor Bay. Included is his first feature film and zombie original,
``Night of the Living Dead'' (1968), shot in black and white in
Pittsburgh for $114,000. ``It would be fun to dismiss this as
undoubtedly the best movie ever made in Pittsburgh,'' the critic
Pauline Kael wrote, ``but it also happens to be one of the most
gruesomely terrifying movies ever made.'' By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   SADNESS-SEX-MOVIE (Undated) _ In late 1994 a film was made that
centered on me and my dark whimsies about romance and heartbreak:
``The Sadness of Sex,'' from my book of the same name. Here's my
sorry tale of how this odd independent movie was brought briefly to
the screen _ and then to the shelf, where it now sits, maybe for
good. The story is my two cents toward the updating of ``Candide''
that famously takes place when a neophyte like me gets involved in
the mad, bad world of glamour-grabbing and economic hardball that
is the film business. By Barry Yourgrau.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PACIFIC-PARADISE-TV (Undated) _ It happens at night in the
summertime when the moon is full and the tides are just right. The
coral reefs of Palau go into a spasm of reproductive surrender,
sowing warm currents with trillions of eggs and sperm that swirl
and dance and ultimately merge to form new life. The orgy is so
wild that in some places, eggs rise through the sea like
snowflakes, blizzards of them. Even sea cucumbers get into the
mood. In the moonlight they suddenly rise up and dance in hypnotic
rhythms, swaying back and forth to seed a new generation. These are
some of the remarkable sights of ``Palau: Paradise of the
Pacific,'' to be shown on Wednesday at 9:00 p.m. on the PBS series
``The Living Edens.'' By William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   OZ-TV-NEWSEASON (Undated) _ Don't look for Dorothy or Toto.
That's the other place. This is Oz, short for Oswald Maximum
Security Penitentiary. Emerald City, the high-tech experimental
prison-within-a-prison _ referred to as Em City _ stresses
rehabilitation. It's run by Tim McManus (Terry Kinney), a 1960's
throwback who believes even the most hardened criminal can change.
Ernie Hudson plays his boss, the warden, a forceful authority
figure who knows better. The critically acclaimed HBO drama series
begins its second eight-episode season July 13 at 10 p.m. By Paula

   MOXEE CITY, Wash. _ They were about to start the Rainiers, and
Bob Harris was getting himself psyched up. ``This is a crazy
business,'' he said, ``and anyone who can do anything else should
stay out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The business at hand was cherries in this, the nation's prime
cherry country, with its acres of luscious garnet Bings and
Lamberts, and especially Rainiers, which are some of the sweetest
and most highly prized cherries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The day before Harris begins harvesting his Rainier cherries is
a tense time. Hundreds of thousands of dollars hang in the balance.
A rainstorm, even a few unexpected gusts of wind, can wipe out the
work of a year in hours.
</P>
<P>
   Most earlier-maturing cherries had already been picked, Harris
said. If his Rainiers and some even later cherries came in without
incident, it might even be a record crop _ or close.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively new variety, the Rainier was developed at the
Washington State University experimental station at Prosser in the
1960s, and it is a cross between the well-known Bing and the
little-known Van. The Rainier costs an average of about $2 a pound
retail in the United States, but connoisseurs in Taiwan and Hong
Kong are willing to pay 10 times that.
</P>
<P>
   Balding and 50-ish, tanned and fit, Harris grows his cherries,
some 300 acres, here in the Yakima Valley, 150 miles southeast of
Seattle. He pretends not to like what he does.
</P>
<P>
   I had flown down from the West Side, as people in the hot, dry
eastern part of Washington refer to the western slope of the
Cascades, which is green, wet and cool. On the drive over to
Harris', the woman on NPR said it was 64 in Seattle; the dusty
thermometer outside Bob Harris' dusty office read 98.
</P>
<P>
   Yakima County produces more cherries than most states. Of
course, this one county is almost as large as Connecticut. But
cherries are just for starters: the county also produces more
apples, more hops, more winter pears than any other in America. It
is rapidly becoming one of the most important areas in the country
for wine grapes and, for good measure, leads the world in the
production of mint.
</P>
<P>
   Yakima farmers work hard, and the fertile land has repaid them,
often handsomely. The old farmhouses have given way to spacious
air-conditioned mansions. New cars are in every driveway, and
private planes are not uncommon. Arizona vacations and foreign
tariffs are as much a part of coffee shop gossip as taxes and rain.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to those dormant (well, mostly dormant) volcanoes off to
the west _ Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens _ the soil
here is largely volcanic and rich in nitrogen. Those snowcapped
mountains give the Yakima Valley more than its fruitful soil.
Rainfall here is about eight inches a year, so without Mount
Rainier's melting snow, much of this verdant land would be a
desert. There would be no cherry trees. Rainier, then, is a
singularly appropriate name for the new star of these cherry
orchards.
</P>
<P>
   But as is the way with stars, the Rainier can be ornery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's murder to grow,'' Harris muttered, almost as if he
begrudged the fruit its popularity. ``It bruises easily, and you
have to go through the orchard three times. With other cherries,
the whole tree ripens at once. Not with the Rainiers.'' Even so, he
admitted, growers can't keep up with the demand.
</P>
<P>
   All cherries are difficult to grow. Not for nothing have they
been called the riskiest fruit. Their deadliest enemies are frost,
birds and rain, with wind and hail not far behind. Rows of smudge
pots in the growers' sheds (some in empty shell casings from a
nearby Army artillery range) and airplane propellers mounted on
tall shafts throughout the orchards (to circulate the warmed air)
testify of the annual battle to fend off frost.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes as much effort to pick 5 acres of Rainiers as it
does 50 acres of dark cherries like Bings and Lapins. Even on a
given tree, Rainiers ripen at different rates.
</P>
<P>
   Picking starts at 4 a.m. and ends at noon so the newly picked
fruit won't have to sit out in the hot sun. Only skilled pickers
work with Rainiers. For one thing, they can be handled only by
their stems. Because they are so delicate and bruise so easily, no
more than 30 percent of the crop goes into the premium packs. A
picker may need two weeks to pick 24 trees, going to each one as
many as eight times.
</P>
<P>
   A flock of hungry birds can be as devastating as any frost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' Harris said, pulling a half-eaten Rainier from
a tree. The bird hadn't nibbled much _ just enough to make it
unsalable.
</P>
<P>
   Colonists brought cherries to America in 1629. The fruit arrived
in the Pacific Northwest with a pioneer named Henderson Lewelling,
who planted seeds in western Oregon in 1847. America's best-known
sweet cherry, the Bing, was developed on his farm in 1875. It was
named for one of his Chinese workers.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the extra-sweet Rainiers is understandably high, but
they make up less than 5 percent of the annual Northwest cherry
crop.
</P>
<P>
   Bings, which make up about 85 percent of the crop here, begin to
appear in supermarkets in mid-June and last until mid-August. They
are the biggest cherries and at their best are mahogany colored, in
both skin and flesh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainiers, golden-colored with a reddish-pink blush and clear
flesh, begin to arrive a week or two after the Bings show up and
are available through the first week of August.
</P>
<P>
   A third variety, the Lambert, comes to market around the end of
June and is available through mid-August. It looks and tastes like
the Bing, but is a bit smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The Bing and the Lambert contain 17 to 19 percent fruit sugar;
the Rainier, 20 to 23 percent. That extra little percentage adds to
the all-important sweetness and helps explain the cherry's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rainier's only marketing problem is its color,'' Harris
said. ``People like rich color.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To give his Rainiers more color this year, he spread strips of
gleaming Mylar film between the rows of trees, to bounce the sun's
rays up into the lower branches much as suntan fanatics use
reflective collars.
</P>
<P>
   And big cherries sell better than small ones. Most growers carry
a seven-hole plastic template in their back pockets. If a cherry
fits through only the largest hole, it's called a nine-row; if it
can get through the smallest, it's a twelve-row. The jargon dates
back to earlier times when cherries were packed in small boxes. If
the packers could fit only nine in a row, they had big cherries and
were happy. With twelve-in-a-row cherries, they knew they would get
less money per box. The boxes are bigger now, but the size
principle hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Not all cherries are sweet. Tart cherries, once called sours,
come mostly from the Midwest _ Michigan is a major producer. They
are the best for canning. Each year about 30 percent of the sweet
cherry crop is exported, mostly to Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
Because of Japan's economic problems, the prospects for cherry
sales there are ``guarded'' this year, said Eric Melton of
Northwest Cherry Growers, the industry's promotional group, but he
added that the Taiwan and Hong Kong markets are growing and might
take up some of the slack. American cherries count as an exotic
fruit in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Bob Harris warily eyeing his fruit-heavy Rainier trees,
I drove over to Roy Farms, where Mark Roy was receiving flat boxes
filled with newly picked cherries. The boxes, in stacks about six
feet high, are rolled slowly though what looks like a large
bathroom shower. The water, a frigid 35 degrees, drops the
temperature of the delicate cherries to preserve them through the
packing process, on what is called ``the line.''
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-generation farmer in the Yakima Valley, Roy is a bit
more relaxed than Harris, perhaps because the Roys are more
diversified. ``We started in hops,'' he said. ``When that market
died, we moved into apples, and when apples began to slow down, we
got into cherries.'' The hops market slackened when the beer market
stalled, but the 20-foot-tall plants are still highly visible
throughout the Yakima Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Temperature is everything in cherry shipping. Cherries destined
for the Northeast travel directly from packing plants in Washington
to the Hunts Point Market in the Bronx in refrigerated trucks. ``We
put recorders in the trucks,'' said B.J. Thurlby, promotion
director for the Washington State Fruit Commission. ``It's a
five-day trip to New York, and constant refrigeration at 32 degrees
is expensive. Let's say some truckers might be tempted to turn it
off now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherries may be difficult to deal with, but these are relatively
happy days in the Yakima Valley orchards. Demand in the United
States continues to grow, and markets overseas are expanding, if
slowly. Last year's crop, more than 90,000 tons of all the
varieties grown here, was the largest on record, and the experts
are predicting that as young trees come into production, crops of
110,000 tons and more are possible over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, conditions and tastes change. One day there might
even be a glut. Chances of that are slim, though, because everyone
who works in the business keeps eating cherries. As he walked
through his orchard complaining, Harris kept pulling cherries off
the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try this,'' he'd say. ``It's delicious.''
</P>
<P>
   I did. And he was right.

THE IMPORTANT FIRST SIP: NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you remember the wine that first won you over? The bottle
that first made you say ``I don't know anything about wine but this
is good stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been a wine you would blush to serve anyone _ or be
caught drinking _ today. But it tasted great at the time and it
introduced you to a new world, another level of sensual enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   The wine books are full of tales of vinous epiphanies. Most of
them seem to start with Bordeaux. ``I had just turned 16,'' one of
them will begin. ``My father gave me a sip from his glass; the '34
Latour. I'll never forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Very dramatic, but I don't believe those tales. Cutting one's
teeth on a Bordeaux first growth is like starting out on music with
Mahler. Not impossible but most improbable. With wine or music, you
have to work your way up.
</P>
<P>
   What started me thinking along these lines was an informal
little tasting I had in Seattle last week with David Lake, the
winemaker at the Columbia Winery. David pulled out most of his
lineup, about 15 wines, single-vineyard chardonnays, a pinot gris,
merlots, a syrah and some rare, older cabernets. He also opened two
easygoing wines, a light, moderately sweet riesling and a simple,
undemanding chenin blanc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of those two as starter wines,'' he said, ``wines for
people who are used to soft drinks and who are just getting into
wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Both wines were light-bodied, with lots of fruit, by which I
mean the taste of the grape they are made from, and a noticeable
touch of sweetness. Not enough to be cloying but enough to ease the
transition from Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   For someone with no previous wine-drinking experience, starting
off with a big red wine like the 1934 Chateau Latour would probably
be a shock; enough of a shock to turn that someone off wine
forever. It is the difference between Norman Rockwell and Andrew
Wyeth. Both well done, but one is infinitely more subtle and
nuanced and ultimately more memorable than the other.
</P>
<P>
   A great red wine is completely dry; all the sugar has been
fermented out. To the trained palate, the wine is balanced; there
is perfect, or near perfect, harmony among tannins, fruit and acid.
An inexperienced wine drinker might find the wine astringent; he or
she will express this by saying it is sour, or too sharp on the
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable wine producers try to cushion the shock for
newcomers by leaving some sugar in the wine during the fermentation
process. It is a technique that made Kendall-Jackson Winery's
Vintners Reserve Chardonnay one of the most popular of all
entry-level wines.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one gets the impression that many relatively
inexpensive wines are a bit sweeter than they once were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans talk dry,'' a saying in the wine trade contends,
``but they drink sweet.'' Is it any wonder, when ketchups and
supposedly spicy barbecue sauces are heavily laced with sugar; when
so many breakfast cereals are more like candy than food?
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 1970s, Americans favored heavily sweetened,
fortified wines like sherry and port. But there is no evidence that
drinking these wines led to an interest in and a taste for table
wines. No more than did the succession of lighter sweet wines that
have been favored over the years by American consumers, wines like
sangria, cold duck and apple wine and, more recently, the immensely
popular wine coolers and the Italian lambruscos like Riunite.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of these wines, known in the trade as pop (for popular)
wines, tend to stick with them or, more precisely, to skip from one
to another. Like Hula-Hoops and tail fins, pop wines tend to come
into fashion quickly, then disappear just as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Serious wine drinkers, people who know their vintages and grape
varieties, who buy good glasses and call their local wine man by
his first name, are a different breed. More often than not, they
like the idea of wine before they get to the wine itself.
</P>
<P>
   The unlucky ones start out with an expensive Bordeaux or
California cabernet and are so put off by the taste that they go
back to beer. The fortunate ones get help from friends or a savvy
wineshop clerk. They start out with simple wines and, determinedly,
educate their palates.
</P>
<P>
   If they get sound advice, they will start with the softer white
wines, like riesling and chenin blanc, and with lighter chardonnays
like Fetzer's Sundance and Kendall-Jackson's Vintner's Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   They will experiment with pinot grigio, like one from Santa
Margherita, which is not sweet but light and uncomplicated. A
flowery, fruity gewuerztraminer, from Navarro, in Mendocino,
Calif., is a perfect starter. It gives the impression of sweetness
without being seriously sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Most people get into red wines these day by asking for merlot,
mostly because it is somewhat trendy. There are excellent merlots
around, but they are not necessarily introductory wines.
</P>
<P>
   Beaujolais, however, is easily the best way to get friendly with
red wine. It is fruity, fresh and uncomplicated and can be chilled
or served with ice. The current vintage is always the best, and the
price is almost always under $10 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Rose is another entrance wine that cannot be ignored. Some
excellent roses have come from the Languedoc region of France in
recent years under labels like Fortant de France and Les Jamelles.
They are real wines and quite capable of fostering an interest in
something better.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is always white zinfandel, which is more pink
than white and which may be both sweetened and carbonated. Mostly,
it is a harmless warm-weather drink that has very little to do with
real table wine and bears hardly any resemblance to genuine red
zinfandel, one of America's best wines.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple that are pretty good: Beringer Vineyards
makes one, and Sutter Home makes another. Will they create an
interest in ``real'' wine? It's possible; they're not that far from
a tasty glass of Beaujolais. &QL;

A COLUMBUS OF CHEFS AMONG THE PAPAYAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: recipe at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By JON NORDHEIMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ On a blistering South Florida afternoon whose heat
approximates a restaurant kitchen's, Norman VanAken, dressed from
chin to cuffs in a white chef's outfit, looks refreshed and cool as
he cuts a path through sweaty shoppers in the Palacio de los Jugos
market.
</P>
<P>
   The Juice Palace started a generation ago on the west side of
Miami as a lowly sidewalk juice bar and sprouted piecemeal into a
sprawling produce and food market filled with intoxicating smells
and high-voltage Spanish chatter. It looks less than regal.
</P>
<P>
   But for Van Aken, the fresh fruits and vegetables shipped here
daily from the Caribbean, Latin America and other tropical lands
represent the raw material for dishes fit for gastronomic royalty.
</P>
<P>
   On this Saturday, he is paying a brief visit to buy mammee
sapota, a starchy fruit he will use to sweeten a few dishes on his
dinner menu.
</P>
<P>
   Van Aken, 46, is the head chef and partner of Norman's in nearby
Coral Gables, which is widely considered the best restaurant in
South Florida. A pioneer in the Florida-Caribbean fusion cooking
that he calls New World cuisine, Van Aken is perhaps the best known
of the Miami chefs who are called the Mango Gang.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years, they invented a cuisine that dipped into
the traditions and flavors of the Western Hemisphere to produce
intensely flavored dishes with imaginative menu descriptions, which
are, like the food itself, a mouthful.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Van Aken's recently published cookbook, ``Norman's
New World Cuisine'' (Random House, $50), offers recipes like
Grilled Florida Spiny Lobster With an Exotic Fruit-Black Bean Salsa
and a Spicy Cumin Seed Drizzle; Rhum and Pepper-Painted Grouper
With a Mango-Habanero Mojo, and Sweet Pan-Fried Plantains and
Snapper Escabeche Ensalada With Salsa Romesco, Arbequine Olives,
Avocado, Oranges and Ribbons of Greens.
</P>
<P>
   Van Aken also expands the definition of New World beyond the
hemisphere and includes Asian climes like the Spice Islands (``the
place Christopher Columbus was trying to find in 1492''). It is a
cuisine, he says, with the common denominators of ``tropical heat,
spices and the sensual zest of regional dishes made with flavorful
fresh food.''
</P>
<P>
   He observes confidently, more in cold analysis than pure boast,
``No one else in Florida has taken it as fast and as far as I
have.''
</P>
<P>
   He disdains those critics who mock some elements of fusion
cooking as trendy or pretentious and lacking in the codified
traditions of, say, French cuisine. He also has contempt for
retrocuisine types at the other extreme, who maintain that all a
restaurant really requires is a good steak and an extra-dry
martini.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diners in my restaurant don't need a Ph.D. to be hit right in
the taste buds,'' he says with a twinkle that lights up his dark
brown eyes, which often turn pensive. ``To them it doesn't matter
how I arrived at these recipes _ all they needed to know was the
food tastes good and is flavorful.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Aken says he never tires of wandering the aisles of the
Palacio de los Jugos with other shoppers whose homelands may be
anywhere in the hemisphere, picking out fresh, unrefrigerated
produce, which, as he puts it, ``has not been yanked against its
will from the earth before its time.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrying three avocado-shape mammees in a small cardboard box
under one arm, he is led by drifting aromas to tables piled high
with dozens of choices like canary-yellow Honduran squashes,
emerald-green plantains from Hawaii and Jamaican papayas. He scoops
up a piece of fruit and takes a quick whiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sapodilla,'' he announces before adding it to his box. ``It
has a nice root-beer taste that goes well in pastries.''
</P>
<P>
   On impulse, he selects several more items that he will work into
dishes over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   For a bright young man from a blue-collar family in Illinois
whose only connection to a professional kitchen was through his
mother, a waitress, the journey up the cooking ladder was a long
climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to be a writer and took jobs in restaurants to
pay the bills, though I did love the cooking end of it,'' Van Aken
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   After studying literature at colleges in Illinois and Hawaii, he
dropped out at 20 to work full time as a breakfast cook in a diner
near his hometown. He struggled through stints in a short-order
kitchen, an all-night barbecue stand and restaurants with
predictable menus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like being a cook had no future,'' he says,
recalling the years spent in kitchens with hard men who looked
older than their years and who hid open bottles of booze in the
lettuce bin and slurped wine sauce out of half-eaten scampi dishes.
``There were a lot of kitchens that broke your heart if you were
serious about food.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Aken made his way to Key West in the mid-1970s, drawn by the
romance of the place and its connection to Ernest Hemingway. It was
there that his link with the Caribbean was forged.
</P>
<P>
   He worked in the kitchens of restaurants with solid reputations
among local food lovers and visitors: Louie's Backyard, the Pier
House and Chez Nancy. With his wife, Janet, also a cook, he
devoured classical cooking books as well as ``The Chez Panisse Menu
Cookbook'' by Alice Waters, who introduced Americans to the
pleasures of fresh regional ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   He soon tried to integrate into his own menus the traditions of
Key West's small Cuban-Bahamian eating places, which serve red
snapper or shrimp sauteed in pungent citrus-based mojo sauce,
steaming plates of black beans and rice, and fried plantains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those little joints in Key West rang my bell,'' he says, his
eyes dancing again. ``I threw off the training wheels and pedaled
in my own direction. It was being a jazz musician in a jam session,
doing someone else's set and becoming more than just a good
sideman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amazing thing was we were doing black beans and rice in a
white tablecloth restaurant with no apology. Mangos and mustard
sauce on roast chicken. We welded the purity of flavorful rustic
food with classical technique to serve the freshest local food
available, side by side with a proper mousse or sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Key West in 1980 to run kitchens elsewhere, he
returned four years later to become head chef at Louie's Backyard,
a move that added luster to his growing reputation. After an
article on the restaurant appeared in Bon Appetit in 1987 and
publication of his first cookbook, ``Feast of Sunlight,'' he opened
his own Key West restaurant, Mira. Despite glowing reviews, it
closed after 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only had 38 seats, and we got crushed during the slow
summer season,'' he notes with the sorrow of one who lost something
very dear. ``It was a heartbreaker.''
</P>
<P>
   After an unhappy stopover in a Boca Raton restaurant, he opened
A Mano in Miami Beach and burnished his reputation with celebrities
and visiting food critics in the fast-paced South Beach scene. He
left in 1993 in a dispute with his partners.
</P>
<P>
   He opened Norman's with seven partners in 1995. For the first
time in his nearly three-decade climb up the food chain, Van Aken
has hit the big time. Rave reviews led to cooking shows on national
television, a national book tour and consulting work, most notably
an assignment by United Airlines to overhaul its first-class dining
fare on flights to South America.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the kitchen is his milieu, whether he's coaxing a gravy
to brown or watching with satisfaction the smoky bubbling of a fish
fillet in hot oil. And there is the daily business of finding the
right string of words to fill a menu with evocative descriptions of
a new dish.
</P>
<P>
   To make one's way through Van Aken's degustation menu is to
marvel at the flavorful bursts in dishes like one described as
pan-roasted chorizo-crusted dolphin on a plantain paella Valenciana
with olives, peas, garbanzos and Romesco aioli.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, his menu is a mouthful. It brings to mind the scene in
``Amadeus'' when Emperor Joseph II of Austria chides Mozart for
using too many notes in his music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah,'' Van Aken says, considering the comparison. ``But how
many people remember the name of that king? Everyone knows
Mozart's.''

THE LONG, HARD ROAD TO ACCLAIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To be downright cartoonish about it, country
singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams can almost be pictured as
Superwoman battling the forces of nature and record-company
politics to make the album of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The six years it took to cut her widely acclaimed new record,
``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,'' illustrates that when it comes to
her music, Williams would rather make great art than cash in on the
wave of attention that greeted her when she won a songwriter's
Grammy Award for Mary Chapin Carpenter's cover of ``Passionate
Kisses'' a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As well as being a critic's favorite and a songwriter's
songwriter, Williams is someone who doesn't cave in easily. When
labels and producers have attempted to mold her into the next
Bonnie Raitt, Williams has shown herself to be as stubborn as she
is talented.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everybody agrees Williams should be a good deal more
famous than she actually is. However, it's more important to her to
make the best music possible rather than release something that
isn't the very best she can give.
</P>
<P>
   That's why tales of her hair-pulling perfectionism during the
making of ``Car Wheels'' have traveled extensively throughout the
music industry for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not that big of an ordeal,'' Williams downplays.
``It's really just part of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the next breath, she tells of a tornado that shut down
the recording studio, an infestation of giant bugs that terrorized
Nashville, and a record company that placed her so far in the
proverbial outfield someone had to call her on a nearby pay phone
to say her team was up at bat.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also faced her own insecurities, forcing her to recut
the record twice from scratch and then lay on overdubs _ all with
the goal of making the songs sound less produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took so long partly because I kept wanting to try different
things,'' Williams, 45, said. ``Then, things weren't happening in
the normal way, and everything came to a screeching halt, putting
me in a state of limbo.''
</P>
<P>
   The years of effort paid off. ``Car Wheels'' has received
through-the-roof reviews from Rolling Stone (``a country-soul
masterpiece''), Spin (``album of the year''), Newsweek (``like Bob
Dylan's `Time Out of Mind,' `Car Wheels' is poised to be an
exhilarating mid-career breakthrough'') and Entertainment Weekly
(which gave it an ``A'') plus raves from No Depression and the
Village Voice online site, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Blackstock, co-editor of No Depression magazine, which
covers the alternative country scene, said he expected the
long-awaited record would suffer the ill effects of too many cooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been so long in the works and so many people were
involved that I didn't think the songs would survive,'' he said.
``Lucinda deserves a lot of credit for sticking to her guns. It's a
terrific album.''
</P>
<P>
   Daughter of Southern poet/university professor Miller Williams
(who read his work at President Clinton's second inauguration),
Lucinda is famous for clashing with labels, producers and business
types, but she's also considered one of the best songwriters in the
field, with a knack for nailing characters with the telling detail.
Her songs have also been covered by Patty Loveless and Tom Petty.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time to start work on ``Car Wheels'' (Mercury), her
fifth album, Williams entered an Austin, Texas, studio with a
longtime friend and resident genius, guitarist-producer Gurf
Morlix.
</P>
<P>
   But after singing on Steve Earle's 1996 album, ``I Feel
Alright,'' Williams fell for its production sound, fired Morlix and
hired the Twang Trust _ Earle and producer Ray Kennedy _ to recut
most of her tracks in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, she brought in E Street Band keyboardist Roy
Bittan to produce even more overdubs in Los Angeles. A string of
top guitarists began traipsing through the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a history of taking a long time to make her records,''
said prolific session musician Greg Leisz, who played 12-string
guitar and mandolin on two ``Car Wheels'' tracks. ``It's really
part of her process where she has to feel completely satisfied with
what she sends out into the world. She's going on her instincts,
and that may be inconvenient for anyone expecting her to get the
album done by a certain time. She has a hard time letting go.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a tribute to Lucinda's perseverance that after so
many people told her the record was finished and great the way it
was, she listened to her inner voice, which told her it wasn't
really ready yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has had famously bad luck with record companies. She
recorded two albums of folk, blues and country standards for
Smithsonian/Folkways before putting out ``Lucinda Williams'' on the
indie Rough Trade, which folded a few years later and never gave
the album much push.
</P>
<P>
   Her most recent record before ``Car Wheels'' was 1992's lively
``Sweet Old World'' for the now-defunct indie Chameleon. As usual,
critics and fans found the disc irresistible, but the troubled
label did little to promote it.
</P>
<P>
   Then she signed with Rick Rubin's American Recordings, which
went through structural changes last year before inking a
distribution deal with Columbia, further delaying ``Car Wheels.''
Williams signed with Mercury after splitting with American.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' rough-edged voice sounds as if she's speaking directly
from the heart on such sad, powerful songs of loss as ``Right in
Time,'' ``Drunken Angel,'' ``Lake Charles,'' ``Jackson'' and the
new album's title track.
</P>
<P>
   She says that when London-based folk-rock producer Joe Boyd
(Nick Drake, Fairport Convention) got an advance copy of ``Car
Wheels,'' he sent Williams a postcard saying the music reminded him
of Bob Dylan's ``Blonde on Blonde'' masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has a loyal cult following, the Nashville-based
Williams is hopeful Mercury will put some marketing muscle behind
the disc. Already some rock and country stations are airing ``Still
I Long for Your Kiss,'' a different version of a song from ``Car
Wheels'' that appears on the soundtrack to ``The Horse Whisperer.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the songs on ``Car Wheels'' are about Southern places
Williams knows from her youth _ Lake Charles (the Louisiana town
where she was born), Lafayette, Lake Ponchartrain, Baton Rouge,
Macon, Greenville, Vicksburg, Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Some songs, she says, were inspired by two books of photographs
_ Shelby Lee Adams' ``Appalachian Legacy,'' with its portraits of
the region's citizens, and Birney Imes' ``Juke Joint,'' which
depicts funky old Mississippi Delta bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I think what happens when you're writing is you're
almost writing from your subconscious and don't even know it until
you finish,'' Williams said. ``Later, you realize you were
expressing something where you put yourself in that place. There
are so many levels.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Williams tell it, mastering sessions for ``Car Wheels''
were interrupted when a tornado hit town the day they were to
begin, just before giant bugs descended on Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``First the power went off,'' she said. ``Then came the cicadas,
these insects that hibernate for 13 years and come out, discard
their shells and buzz around. They look like locusts and they hang
around and make this intense noise for six weeks while they mate.
Then, they die and the larva drops on the ground and they burrow
and feed off roots and live underground for the next 13 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said cicadas, while substantial, are basically
harmless.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just big, dumb bugs,'' she said. ``You don't even
notice they're there after a while. But they make this high-pitched
noise that carries on day and night. The fact that they came out in
Nashville the same year as my record gave us something to think
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who recently appeared in two sold-out shows in New
York, will play some Lilith Fair dates before Los Angeles shows in
late summer. In the past few months, she's sung on tribute albums
to Kate Wolf, Howlin' Wolf and Gram Parsons (with close friend
Emmylou Harris, who also sings on ``Car Wheels'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, and Joey Ramone asked me to write something for Ronnie
Spector's album, so I'm kind of excited about that,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her superb new album, Williams isn't optimistic about
her future on country radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget it,'' she says. ``They don't even play Emmylou. It's
like, `We'd like to thank the country music industry for all their
support!' There's just nothing I can do about it.''

 &HT;    CITIES HEALTHIER FINANCIALLY, BUT WORRIES REMAIN
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most U.S. cities are riding high on the nation's
economic boom, but rough times could be ahead, the National League
of Cities reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Seven out of 10 cities said they were better off financially
compared to a year ago, according to the league's survey of 314
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things look pretty good,'' said Brian O'Neill, a councilman
from Philadelphia and president of the league. Most cities are
doing well because of ``a continuing effort by cities to work
harder, smarter, more efficiently and more creatively then ever
before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While most cities report improvement over last year, the gap
between city revenues and the growth of the domestic economy
continues to widen, the report says. In the past 10 years, city
revenues have grown 46 percent while state revenues have grown by
67 percent and federal revenues by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, cities are being asked to take on more and
more duties once regarded as federal or state responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trends look very, very scary,'' O'Neill said. ``City
leaders are balancing scarce resources alongside a daunting list of
priorities and needs.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, with welfare reform the responsibility has
shifted from the federal government to the state and local level.
</P>
<P>
   The league is also concerned about efforts by the federal
government to block cities' access to new revenue, such as an
Internet tax proposal that has already passed the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would block an estimated 30,000 state and local
governments from levying new taxes on business conducted via the
Internet. Sponsors say the legislation is intended to encourage the
use of Internet-based business.
</P>
<P>
   But state and local officials fear the moratorium could deplete
public coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we need is someone in Washington pulling the
plug on our businesses and our tax base by creating another special
tax haven _ at our expense _ that no one needs,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings in the survey include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nearly 30 percent of cities increased local user fees or other
charges.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Thirty-seven percent of cities increased the size of their
work force, while 10 percent reduced it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nineteen percent of cities increased property tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nineteen percent of cities increased education spending.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In cities with more than 300,000 population, 91 percent spent
more money on public safety.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Reductions in property tax occurred most among cities in the
Midwest and the South.
</P>
<P>
   The 314 cities in the survey included 27 of the 51 largest U.S.
cities, 40 percent of cities with populations between 100,000 and
300,000, and one-third of cities with populations from 50,000 to
100,000. It also included a random sample of 115 cities and towns
with populations between 10,000 and 50,000.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the weekend arrives and the city's daytime motor
shifts into idle, New York prepares to greet its favorite meal. It
is called brunch, and it is weird. A linguistic and culinary
hybrid, brunch is a breakfast that begins with a cocktail. Or a
lunch that's organized around a stack of buckwheat pancakes. It's
neither fish nor fowl nor good red herring, although all three can
wind up on the same plate.
</P>
<P>
   At Cafe Botanica, in the Essex House, patrons glide past a
buffet table that starts with danishes and bagels on one end, moves
quickly to a mountain of peeled cold shrimp, and takes a sharp left
turn toward a medley of Oriental dishes like vegetable dumplings
with a soy dipping sauce and a three-color seaweed salad.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer oddness, however, nothing on the table quite matches
the sardine-potato tart at Home restaurant in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of mashed potatoes left over one Saturday night,
and I remembered some sardines I'd seen at Murray's Cheese Shop,
packed in salt,'' said David Page, Home's owner and chef,
explaining the origin of the dish. ``I came up with a kind of cake
with a red bell-pepper sauce, and a poached egg on top.'' The dish,
now served with a roasted tomato sauce, has never been off the menu
since.
</P>
<P>
   The strange world of brunch continues to expand, generating
bizarre new life forms, embracing flavors and ingredients never
before associated with mankind's pre-noon existence. There was a
time when huevos rancheros represented the outer limit of
brunchtime experimentation, but as chefs have ranged far and wide,
and then farther and wider, in search of new influences, and as
diners have adopted a global outlook, the always fluid boundaries
of brunch have stretched to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   No one is complaining _ not in New York, where every weekend the
faithful line up outside hot spots like Isabella's on the Upper
West Side, or Friend of a Farmer on Irving Place, or E.J.'s
Luncheonette on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Rain or shine, brunch lures everybody: couples who may or may
not have met the night before, young people treating their parents,
couples with children, young women in pairs or 10-strong gangs and,
in the gay brunch belts of west Greenwich Village and Chelsea, men
in pairs and big groups.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers notoriously chafe at lines and delays, but come the
weekend, they meekly tolerate a wait of 30 minutes for a crack at
oysters on the half shell, baby spinach omelets and Irish steel-cut
oatmeal.
</P>
<P>
   For the hundreds of restaurants that routinely serve a Saturday
brunch as well as the more traditional Sunday one, the brunch
stampede is a bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   Popover Cafe, a 90-seat restaurant on the Upper West Side,
serves nearly 500 brunches on a busy Sunday. Isabella's, a 195-seat
restaurant on Columbus Avenue, serves 1,000 or more. Matthew's, on
the Upper East Side, does its biggest business of the week at
Sunday brunch. ``Any restaurant that's open for brunch is packed,''
said John Villa, the executive chef at Park View at the Boathouse,
in Central Park. ``It's guaranteed business.''
</P>
<P>
   Chefs hate brunch. ``They hate cooking it and they hate thinking
about it,'' Bobby Flay, the chef at Mesa Grill, said. ``Saturday
night tends to be the busiest of the week, and they've probably
gone out to have a few drinks afterward. Suddenly it's Sunday
morning and you have to come in and cook eggs.'' Flay says that he
happens to love brunch, but on this issue, he is out there alone.
</P>
<P>
   Villa said: ``To me, it's one of the hardest menus to write. You
have to have a balance, but you can't have too many breakfast
items, because the meal carries on until 4 p.m.'' In his case, that
means a Thai-influenced shrimp frittata and a grouper club sandwich
side by side with granola and yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   If chefs seem to be taking license with brunch, that's because
freedom is written into the charter of this oddity among meals.
</P>
<P>
   Although the meal itself came to glory in the United States, the
word is a British invention, coined in 1895 by Guy Beringer in a
visionary article titled ``Brunch: A Plea.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of England's early Sunday dinner, a postchurch ordeal of
heavy meats and savory pies, the author wrote, why not a new meal,
served around noon, that starts with tea or coffee, marmalade and
other breakfast fixtures before moving along to the heavier fare?
</P>
<P>
   By eliminating the need to get up early on Sunday, brunch would
make life brighter for Saturday-night carousers. It would promote
human happiness in other ways as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brunch is cheerful, sociable and inciting,'' Beringer wrote.
``It is talk-compelling. It puts you in a good temper, it makes you
satisfied with yourself and your fellow beings, it sweeps away the
worries and cobwebs of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a century later, Beringer's template for brunch
remains as valid as the day it was created, perhaps because, in
drafting his culinary declaration of independence, he was not
overly specific about what dishes should be served. He demanded
``everything good, plenty of it, variety and selection.'' In a
postscript, he suggested that beer and whiskey could be served
instead of coffee and tea, laying down a precedent for the mimosa,
the Bloody Mary and the screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   It took a while for brunch to drift across the Atlantic, but
after World War I, Americans embraced brunch and made it their own.
The Jazz Age even created a novelty, a kind of second brunch that
filled the gap between dinner and the last, mad grab for excitement
as dawn poked its intrusive rosy finger into the party.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The Nation, noting that brunch had hitherto been a meal for poor
students and ``the lie-abed lady,'' described with some amusement
the mad 5 a.m. dash for sausages, pancakes and ``doughnuts, as
dainty and sugared as our grandmother never knew how to make
them.'' Then it was back to the dance floor for ``camel walks and
other steps from the zoo.''
</P>
<P>
   What might Beringer have made of the ``Sunday Strollers'
Brunch'' served at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in the 1940s, with its
sauerkraut juice, its clam cocktails, its chicken liver omelet in
Madeira, its calf's liver with hash browns, its Scotch woodcock? Or
House &AMP; Garden's brunch recipe, offered in 1952, for rice almond
pancakes served with herbed shad roe? ``A delicate hash, light fish
balls, and liver and bacon are all appropriate,'' one women's
magazine wrote in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Beringer asked for variety and selection, which is exactly
what the brunch menu at the River Cafe offers. Diners can start
with Cheddar soup or codfish cakes before advancing to omelets and
pancakes. At Mesa Grill, you can lead into the cinnamon and pecan
waffles or ranch-style eggs with a cornmeal-coated chili relleno
filled with goat cheese or a grilled white corn taco wrapped around
barbecued pork, potatoes and tomatillo relish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as much a state of mind as it is a meal,'' said Michael
McLaughlin, who ruled that chili, pizza and leg of lamb did not
belong in the brunch section of his cookbook ``Good Mornings,'' but
chili-rubbed steaks, Gruyere fondue and brownies did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breakfast has regional differences, but it is more
clear-cut,'' he said. ``Brunch is much more eclectic, although I
would say that it has to be on a weekend, it has a festive aspect
to it, and it's social. You never have brunch alone, while
breakfast for one is perfect, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunch may be short on rules, but people have strong feelings
about what makes a good one. ``I like the fun of all the different
foods you can get,'' Elizabeth England, a writer, said. Lara
Shriftman, a public relations executive, said she gravitates toward
Friend of a Farmer because it feels ``very country, earthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Page, of Home, says it is no coincidence that family groups turn
out for a meal at a restaurant with a name like his, as though
searching for the ideal, family-around-the-table experience that
Americans regard wistfully on the television screen but never
actually put into practice.
</P>
<P>
   Brunch spells warmth, abundance and homeyness. It is, in many of
its associations, an invitation to go back to childhood. ``People
respond to the smell of coffee and bacon in the morning,'' said
Carrie Levine, the chef and owner of Good Enough to Eat, a cozy
restaurant on the Upper West Side. ``It reminds you of childhood,
when someone was cooking for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. England said, ``I like those places that have that homey,
baked-goody sort of feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levine has observed that bad economic news somehow
translates into increased brunch business, as nail-chewing traders
and brokers seek solace in the foods that bring them back to a
simpler time.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of this gentle picture is that, for the restaurant
staff, brunch can be hell. It's not easy feeding hundreds of
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brunch people tend to be very fussy,'' Marc Propper, the owner
of Grove in Greenwich Village, said. ``They want their eggs this
way, not that way, they want sauce on the side. The list of special
requirements goes on and on.'' One customer actually insisted that
the staff butter his toast. ``We didn't do it,'' Propper said. ``We
had to draw the line somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levine has seen the same customers. ``Even the words they
use when ordering tend to be childish,'' she said. ``They'll say
they don't want their bacon mushy.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame them, really? New York is a tough town. No wonder
its citizens wake up on Saturday and Sunday desperate for a little
coddling, and ready for a spiritual return to the wholesome,
abundant meals that good folks out in the heartland are eating.
They want lemon ricotta pancakes, a lobster and arugula omelet, and
a nice cold pitcher of tequila punch. What's so odd about that?

HORROR AS AN EVERLASTING FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 12) 
(th) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in George A. Romero's ``Day of the Dead'' there is a
revelation. In a huge subterranean cavern cut off from what's left
of human civilization, a doctor in a blood-soaked smock rips and
pulls at a male body on an operating table.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unspeakably gory things being done to him, the
fellow lies there blinking as if nothing is happening until
suddenly something riles him. Sitting up, he reaches for the doctor
and loses most of his intestines.
</P>
<P>
   Typical zombie. Outside, a million of them are clawing their way
toward soldiers and scientists in the cavern. Inside, the doctor
picks up a power drill and bores a hole in the forehead of his
patient _ or specimen, or whatever you want to call it. The body
expires. The doctor is pleased and excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can be domesticated,'' he cries. ``Knowing what they are,
we can condition and control them.''
</P>
<P>
   Released in 1985, ``Day of the Dead'' is one of four Romero
titles just reissued on video by Anchor Bay. Included is his first
feature film and zombie original, ``Night of the Living Dead''
(1968), shot in black and white in Pittsburgh for $114,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fun to dismiss this as undoubtedly the best movie
ever made in Pittsburgh,'' the critic Pauline Kael wrote, ``but it
also happens to be one of the most gruesomely terrifying movies
ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   These days it's silly to think of gangs of dead people, most of
them looking as if they were dressed at Bob's Discount, lurching
around in a trancelike state. On re-watching the films, however, it
can be said that their methodology has lost none of its force.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Roger Corman, Romero, 58, is credited with adding
extreme violence and gore to the modern horror film.
</P>
<P>
   ``George literally created a brand new world,'' said John
Carpenter, the director of ``Halloween'' and other horror films.
``The dead feeding on the living _ an incredibly simple but creepy
idea pulled off with a bravado style.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Day of the Dead,'' the soldiers are itching to blast
zombies, but with countless numbers to contend with, that would be
hopeless. Instead the doctor suggests a constructive alternative.
Romero films often hold out solutions. If only people would listen,
which, of course, they don't.
</P>
<P>
   In Romero movies, trouble is always snowballing, unstoppable in
the face of misinformation, paranoia and mistaken impressions,
distrust and plain stupidity. For example, in ``The Crazies''
(1973), a lesser-known film in the Anchor Bay package, a town
threatened by a biological weapon goes berserk when the Army
refuses to tell the people what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   As if in a nightmare, Romero protagonists never get the two ends
together. ``The themes are very simple,'' he said recently.
``People don't communicate well enough with each other, which means
that anything out of the ordinary leaves them befuddled.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Night of the Living Dead,'' heightened radiation is causing
corpses to rise in mutated form and go off looking for food:
people. In the first sequel, ``Dawn of the Dead,'' released in
1978, humans barricaded in a shopping mall manage to hold off the
proliferating zombies. By ``Day of the Dead,'' however, the ghouls
outnumber the living by 400,000 to 1 and have feasted their way
from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of someone as talented as Romero, outlandish
subject matter and low production budgets merge into a striking
reality. At present he writes scripts and proposes
multimillion-dollar projects (all in various states of development,
he says), but he began his career making industrial films and later
used many of the same people in his first features. Camaraderie and
inexperience bred freshness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the innocence of the bunch of us making a movie
together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His notion of horror took form when he was a child living in the
Bronx. ``I always loved the genre stuff,'' he said. ``When I was
growing up, horror had an allegory underneath _ stop the bomb,
radiation is killing us _ but on the surface it was a
roller-coaster ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he refined the mix. ``Basically my films are about the
unwillingness to accept change,'' he said. ``Once you fix that
thought, you can go in and do the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   By the ride he means a wild spree of blood and mayhem. Prompted
by the success of the first two ``dead'' films, backers offered
Romero $7 million to make ``Day.'' They also insisted that the
picture have an R rating, which would have been impossible with
hundreds of zombies ripping people's heads off, gnawing on limbs
and wolfing down great quantities of entrails.
</P>
<P>
   If he had got the $7 million, Romero said, he might have tried a
more complicated turn of plot. The doctor could have induced the
zombies to fight one another, which would have made a nicely
Romeroesque comment on the human condition. Instead he was given $3
million, which limited the film to a simpler scenario.
</P>
<P>
   In the cavern, the scientists and a grubby collection of troops
can't find a solution to their mutual zombie problem because they
can't get beyond their chronic disdain for one another.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor does train a ghoul called Bub to perform basic
functions with a toothbrush and a telephone, but then he makes the
mistake of feeding Bub a couple of dead soldiers. A psychotic
captain responds with a sustained burst of machine-gun fire to the
doctor's midsection.
</P>
<P>
   So much for experimentation. Bub does go on to prove that a
zombie can indeed be trained to do human bidding if properly
rewarded _ meaning fed. Like all zombies, he was a flesh-and-blood
human once himself. In fact, aside from their facial craters,
zipper scars and glazed expressions, zombies seem weirdly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a lot like us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically they're innocents lumbering their way through it,
just trying to put bread on the table,'' Romero said. ``They're the
blue-collar monster in the cotton fields. Lugosi's up in the
mansion.'' &QL;

SOME WRITERS ARE AT THEIR BEST IN SHORT FORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most who read for pleasure read fiction, and most who read
fiction read novels. And that's unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the novel on its best behavior is what D.H. Lawrence
called it, the ``bright book of life.'' But many novels behave
badly, because their parents are deficient in discipline and
perhaps in understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking another metaphor I've long enjoyed, the late Texas
author George Sessions Perry said, ``A short story is a girl you
take on a date. A novel is the woman you marry.'' (Perry himself
wrote some exhilarating short stories before delivering a splendid
novel _ ``Hold Autumn in Your Hand'' _ which, however, provoked his
suicide. Not all marriages have happy endings.)
</P>
<P>
   The point is, people do not read short stories, but they should.
They cling to a practice of novel-reading that became a habit, on
both sides of the Atlantic, in the long-ago Victorian age.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, authors profiled as novelists often made their
more nearly perfect accomplishments in the shorter form. Consider,
for example, Henry James. He is the acknowledged master of the
novel of psychological insight; yet many among today's readers,
accustomed as they are to the quick fix, consider James a windbag.
The economical ghost tale, ``The Turn of the Screw,'' is an
exception, pointing to what readers should do: Read Henry James'
incomparable short stories.
</P>
<P>
   It is also said of present-day premier novelists _ e.g., Larry
McMurtry (''Lonesome Dove,'') Charles Frazier (''Cold Mountain'') _
that just getting into their long novels is difficult. Today many
readers start novels they never will finish. A short story, though,
is unlikely to be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many writers, happy and secure in short-story production,
recognize the novel as an obligation, a prerequisite for
recognition as an ``author.'' Nathaniel Hawthorne's marvelous
``Twice-Told Tales'' were apprentice pieces for his destiny as
America's first unarguably great novelist. Edgar Allan Poe followed
Hawthorne's path and pattern but died at 40 before we had a Poe
novel. More recently, Raymond Carver was ``working up'' to a novel
when the Reaper claimed that superb short-story writer at age 50.
</P>
<P>
   The novel is complex, usually characterized by intricate
plotting. In the short story plot is very nearly absent, as the
narrative usually revolves around a single incident.
</P>
<P>
   Few are the authors who do not respond to the siren lure of the
novel and are content to write short stories exclusively. Canada's
Alice Munro apparently is one of them. For more than 30 years she
has been mining gold in the short-story terrain, consistently
earning critical raves. But other than people who both buy and read
``The New Yorker,'' few to this day know who Alice Munro is.
</P>
<P>
   When Munro's ``Lives of Girls and Women'' arrived in the early
1970s, the publisher (McGraw-Hill) labeled the work a novel. Like
Sherwood Anderson's famous ``Winesburg, Ohio,'' it had a unified
setting and background characters who kept bobbing up in different
narrative vignettes. Munro, though, did not agree; and ``Lives of
Girls and Women'' eventually was republished as a collection of
short stories.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Munro, prose poet of the commonplace, may be the very best
short story writer on the present scene _ because of, rather than
despite, her limited canvas. The small Canadian town of Jubilee is
Munro's own Gibbsville or Yoknapatawpha. Her understanding of its
people and their place never fails to beguile. There is a
just-rightness in her every detail.
</P>
<P>
   But most of our literary gods are enjoyable in the short-story
realm _ Hawthorne and Poe; Herman Melville and Mark Twain; Edith
Wharton and Willa Cather; Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett;
Scott Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolfe; and especially Ernest Hemingway,
some of whose novels actually are clunkers, but for whom redemption
is absolute in his short stories.

 &HT;    STUDY CITES ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF IMMIGRATION
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A study released Tuesday bolsters the notion that
immigrants are a boon to _ not a drain on _ the U.S. economy, in
part because immigrants are slightly more likely than U.S. natives
to start businesses that generate jobs and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigrants are not just workers. They are also people who
start businesses,'' said author Stephen Moore, an economist with
the libertarian Cato Institute. His report listed 10 high-tech
companies, including Intel and Cypress Semiconductor, that were
founded or co-founded by foreign-born entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's study, published jointly by the Cato Institute and the
National Immigration Forum, an umbrella organization of
immigrant-advocacy groups, is the latest addition to an array of
studies that have attempted to influence immigration policy by
putting a dollar value on immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of restrictions on immigration, including Rep. Lamar
Smith, R-Texas, and the Center for Immigration Studies, said Moore
ignored previous studies that found an economic down side to
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigration is neither all good nor all bad, and no auditor
would sign off on immigration numbers that come from only one side
of the balance sheet,'' Smith said in a prepared statement that
cited previous studies reporting immigration's negative effects on
low-skilled U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was particularly is concerned about Census Bureau
statistics showing that 37 percent of recent immigrants arrived in
the United States without having graduated from high school. In
contrast, 16 percent of U.S. natives lack a high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Moore focused on a section of the same census report that showed
that recent immigrants are 50 percent more likely to have advanced
degrees than U.S. natives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigrants tend to be disproportionately represented at the
high and low ends of the distribution of skills and education,''
Moore wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said his study underscores the benefits that would flow
from more H-1B visas for highly skilled foreign workers. The supply
of 65,000 visas ran out in early May, and the Senate has already
voted to make more visas available before the next batch is issued
beginning Oct. 1. The House version of the bill, written by Smith,
is stalled because of his insistence that H-1B employers document
their efforts to hire U.S. workers for the jobs being filled by
foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the bottleneck is cleared in the House, Moore said, ``I
really believe we will be shooting ourselves in the foot. We ought
to let more of these high-skilled immigrants in.''

HOW SALTING CUCUMBERS WORKS MAGIC IN A DISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Recipe at end.) 
(th) 
 By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, a simple salad features such powerful flavors that by
adding a couple of straightforward ingredients, a whole meal
appears, as if by magic.
</P>
<P>
   The starting place here is a Southeast Asian-style cucumber
salad with a dressing made from lime juice, lemon grass, fish sauce
(called nam pla in Thailand and nuoc mam in Vietnam) and a few
other strong seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   This dressing mingles perfectly with the natural juice of the
cucumbers, which I draw out by salting, a process that takes some
time but almost no effort.
</P>
<P>
   If you slice cucumbers before salting and squeeze them after
they've sat for a while, you wind up with ultra-crisp slices that
contain little remaining liquid. But for a salad like this one, I
cut the cucumber lengthwise and salt the seeded sides before
slicing, thereby removing some but not all of their liquid. The
result is firm but still quite moist cucumbers that continue to
weep after slicing.
</P>
<P>
   This step transforms a dressing that is already juicy into one
that is quite thin. This consistency, I realized, has its
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   When I placed the cucumbers on top of a bed of salad greens,
their dressing moistened the greens instantly. And by adding a few
grilled scallops to the top, I created an easy one-dish meal whose
flavor really jumped off the plate.
</P>
<P>
   It looks lovely, too, especially if the cucumbers have not been
waxed and you can leave them unpeeled. And it is extremely low in
fat (although not by design, I assure you).
</P>
<P>
   If some of the ingredients here are new to you, be assured they
can be found at many city markets and in most large suburban
supermarkets. Although fish sauce may be an acquired taste, the
only ingredient here that requires what might be an unfamiliar
technique is whole lemon grass, which is usually sold by the stalk
and looks like a scallion.
</P>
<P>
   Trim off the top and bottom of the stalk, then make a slit along
its length. Peel off the tough outer sheath to reveal the tender
inner core: that's the part of the lemon grass to use. (Sometimes,
supermarkets sell the leaves of young lemon grass in packages;
simply mince them.)
</P>
<P>
   Although I like scallops best to finish this salad, they are far
from the only option. I tried a couple of pieces of pan-seared
halibut with great success. A lightly grilled steak or boneless
chicken breasts would work beautifully, too.
</P>
<P>
   CUCUMBER SALAD WITH SCALLOPS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   4 medium cucumbers, at least 2 pounds
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 2 limes
</P>
<P>
   1 small clove garlic, very finely minced
</P>
<P>
   1 small chili, finely minced, or to taste (\ teaspoon of crushed
red pepper flakes is a good substitute)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced lemon grass
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   6 cups mixed salad greens
</P>
<P>
   1 to 1 1/2 pounds sea scallops
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon neutral oil, like canola
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon cayenne
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped mint, cilantro, basil or a combination
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dark sesame oil.
</P>
<P>
   1. Peel cucumbers if they have been waxed, then trim their ends
and cut them in half the long way. Scoop out seeds with a teaspoon.
Sprinkle each half with about 1/4 teaspoon of salt, then place them
in a colander. Let drain for about 30 minutes. Rinse lightly, and
drain again. Cut into 1/8- to 1/4-inch-thick slices and place in a
bowl.
</P>
<P>
   2. Mix together the fish sauce, lime juice, garlic, chili, lemon
grass and sugar. Thin with a tablespoon of water. Taste, and add
more of any flavoring you wish. Toss dressing with cucumbers, and
set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place greens on a large platter. Put a large nonstick skillet
over high heat. In a bowl, toss scallops with oil, then sprinkle
them with salt and cayenne. When skillet begins to smoke, add
scallops one at a time; do not crowd them. Cook for about 2 minutes
on the first side, turning as they brown; depending on their size,
cook for 1 to 3 minutes on the second side. (Scallops are best when
their interior is slightly underdone; cut into one to check it.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Toss cucumbers with most of the herbs, and spoon them and the
dressing over the greens. Top with the scallops. Drizzle with
sesame oil, and top with remaining herbs. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL;

NATIVE AMERICANS OFFER LESSONS ON ROLE OF WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (With WOMEN'S-RIGHTS.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATE GURNETT  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The actions and support of many women in the
suffrage and reform movements read throughout the Northeast like
the roots of an ever-strengthening tree.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of those influences:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NATIVE AMERICANS
</P>
<P>
   If Seneca Falls, N.Y., was a cradle of reform in 1848, it could
be said that an Iroquois hand was rocking the cradle. Early
suffragists needed to look no further than their Seneca and
Onondaga neighbors to witness women active in government and
financially independent.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Matilda Joslyn Gage
visited Iroquois women. And Lucretia Mott spent a month at a Quaker
school with the Senecas at Cattaraugus in 1848, just before she
traveled to Seneca Falls for the world's first women's rights
convention, Sally Roesch Wagner explains in her essay collection:
``The Untold Story of the Iroquois Influence on Early Feminists.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their self-described ``modern'' white counterparts,
Iroquois women had the power to nominate political leaders, issued
the last word on whether to wage war, had custody of their children
and were not victims of male violence, Wagner writes. Even
bloomers, the first popular female pants, resembled a loose tunic
and leggings worn by the Native American friends of their creator,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Stanton, Gage, Mott, and their feminist contemporaries, the
Native American conception of everyday decency, nonviolence and
gender justice must have seemed the promised land,'' Wagner wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOJOURNER TRUTH
</P>
<P>
   Born a slave named Isabella to a Dutch owner in 1797, Truth more
than any other woman embodied the fusion of the abolition and
suffrage movements. In 1843 she changed her name to Sojourner Truth
and began to travel and preach, later lecturing for the
abolitionist cause.
</P>
<P>
   She attended her first women's rights convention in 1850 and in
1851 delivered her famous ``Ain't I a Woman'' speech at the Woman's
Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio. After the Civil War she found
homes and jobs for recently freed slaves.
</P>
<P>
   In visit to the Stanton home, Sojourner Truth leaned back and
smoked her pipe as Stanton's daughter read her the newspapers. When
Harriot Stanton asked Truth if she could read, she recalled Truth's
reply: ``Oh, no, honey, I can't read little things like letters. I
read big things, like men.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMELIA BLOOMER
</P>
<P>
   A governess from Homer, N.Y., Amelia Bloomer moved to Seneca
Falls with her husband. Male editors refused to publish women
writers, so Bloomer started her own monthly temperance paper _ The
Lily _ in 1849, one of several such female papers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote articles under the pen name
``Sunflower.'' In 1852, The Lily's published sketches of the
``bloomer'' costume, a knee-length dress over trousers gathered at
the ankles. The outfit was created by Elizabeth Smith Miller,
daughter of abolitionist Gerrit Smith and a Stanton cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Miller reportedly adopted the set so she could climb stairs with
a lamp in one hand and a child in the other.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SUSAN B. ANTHONY
</P>
<P>
   Susan B. Anthony, who spent most of her life stoking the embers
of women's revolt, was a 50-year friend and unwavering ally of
Stanton _ ``my good angel,'' as Stanton put it, ``always pushing
and goading me to work ... it has been said that I forged the
thunderbolts and she fired them.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony didn't learn of the 1848 women's rights convention until
it was over. She met Stanton in 1851 when Amelia Bloomer introduced
them in Seneca Falls after an anti-slavery speech organized by
Henry Stanton and William Lloyd Garrison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1872 Anthony was arrested for voting and fined $100. She
refused to pay to a government that denied her representation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MARY BAKER EDDY
</P>
<P>
   As the activists gathered for women's rights at Seneca Falls in
1848, Mary Baker Eddy was a widowed New Hampshire mother in her
late 20s who had lost rights to her property when her husband died.
A victim of chronic ill health, she began to experiment with the
homeopathic healing that eventually led her to become the founder
of Christian Science.
</P>
<P>
   As pastor of her own church in Boston, she built twin pulpits
for a Mother and Father God. Male doctors scorned her as she healed
their patients. She later published ``Science and Health with Key
to the Scriptures'' and began The Christian Science Monitor
newspaper.

Representative Barney Frank publicly disclosed his homosexuality in
1987 were mischaracterized in a Boston Globe story. Allegations

However, Frank later said he chose to acknowledge his homosexuality
partly because of his problematic relationship with Gobie, which

   &QL;  RIGHTS GROUP SLAPS PHILA.'S NYPD BLUE APPROACH
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Kane
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 7 -- A human rights group says Philadelphia and
other cities trying to model their police departments after New
York City's aggressive, zero-tolerance approach to crime should be
wary of the law of unintended consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In the first four years of New York's aggressive community
policing -- which is credited with dramatic decreases in crime,
including a 70 percent drop in murder -- complaints of excessive
force by police shot up 62 percent, according to Human Rights
Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based group contended that Philadelphia already has
``one of the worst reputations of big city police departments in
the United States'', citing the old controversies from the rogue
cops in the city's 39th District. But the group's directors said
the problem could grow worse if new Commissioner John Timoney
doesn't place stricter controls on his troops in their crackdown on
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be at least as aggressive in crimes by police,''
said Kenneth Roth, Human Rights Watch's executive director,
promising to make police abuse in America ``the international
injustice that it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   One contributor to the report, however, said that Human Rights
Watch missed the point on New York's get-tough approach to crime,
which began in 1994. Then, New York Police Chief William Bratton
and his deputies, including Timoney, made it easier for citizens to
file complaints against police, something that has always been
difficult in Philadelphia, according to James J. Fyfe, a former New
York cop who is now a criminologist at Temple University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, New York's citizen review board fielded 5,487
complaints about police, including 2,173 citing excessive force; by
1996, it took in 8,869 complaints, 3,139 of which were based on
excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, by contrast, had just 577 citizen complaints in
1996, with 221 alleging physical abuse, according to the Internal
Affairs Division. Of those, 67 percent were from Hispanics or
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Allyson Collins, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said
anecdotal evidence had shown similar upticks in police violence
complaints in New Orleans and Washington, both of which adopted the
New York approach to crime. But Fyfe contended that many complaints
in these cities lack merit, coming from petty criminals not used to
being hassled by police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, if you have cops acting more aggressive, you'll
have more complaints,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Fyfe said the biggest problems confronting Timoney was that he
held firing power of only a handful of his deputies, unlike
Baltimore, where the commissioner appoints the 29 cops directly
below him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No boss has ever been held accountable (in Philadelphia),''
Fyfe said, something Human Rights Watch would agree with. ``It's
possible to enforce the law vigorously without using excessive
force.''

   A Tell-All Volume About Smoothies and Juices
</P>
<P>
   Throwing a banana and some yogurt in the blender or sticking
some orange halves on a reamer is not all it takes to make a
smoothie or some juice. ``Smoothies and Juices,'' a new book by Ed
Marquand (Abbeville Press, $12.95), will set you straight.
</P>
<P>
   This attractive little volume leaves no detail unexplained:
whether to peel or pit certain fruits before processing them, how
to shop for ingredients, what equipment is needed, what it takes to
turn a juice into a smoothie and even how to add supplements to
increase the nutrient value of the drink.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are simple, tasty combinations, like a blood orange
and banana drink; a carrot, tomato and jalapeno juice, and a
nectarine, strawberry and blueberry mixture. None are sweetened
with sugar, though a few call for honey.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping Nourishment
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here is a street cart that has always been out of the
reach of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, as it is stationed on the steps
near the doorway of ABC Carpet and Home, 888 Broadway (18th
Street). Shoppers in the store and people in the neighborhood line
up for the high-quality fare, which comes from the Parlor Cafe
inside ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent muffins, scones, brioches, doughnuts, cinnamon buns
and cookies, $1.25 to $1.85, are sold from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily,
along with coffee, juices and fresh lemonade. The cart also has
sorbets and gelatos, mainly in the afternoon, $2 to $4.
</P>
<P>
   Ice Cream's New Face
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jeremy Kraus is so proud of his accomplishment that
he has put his face on the containers of Jeremy's Microbatch Ice
Creams. Kraus, 22, introduced his brand last year and started
selling it in the New York region a few months ago. It is called
Microbatch because the ice cream is made in relatively small
amounts and only a few flavors at a time. It is produced at
Perry's, an ice-cream company near Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee chocolate chip, chocolate peanut butter, and vanilla
oatmeal raisin are the three flavors available at supermarkets,
including Pathmark, Grand Union and Shop Rite, for $2.75 to $4 a
pint. In August, these will be replaced by three new flavors,
including a Fuzzy Navel, which was inspired by a peach schnapps
cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   Kosher Parmesan
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Zabar's, at 80th Street and Broadway, has received
its first shipment of kosher Parmigiano-Reggiano. The cheese was
produced by Pieffe Co. of Reggio Emilia, Italy, in November 1996
under the supervision of a rabbi, and has been aging since then. It
is the only imported kosher Italian parmesan, and it is kosher for
Passover.
</P>
<P>
   The cheese comes precut in wedges of about 3/4 pound and 2 1/4
pounds. Zabar's sells it in these two sizes for $12.98 a pound.
Because Zabar's is not a kosher store, the cheese cannot be cut on
the premises. The cheese is good quality, but because it is sealed
in plastic, it is fairly moist and somewhat less crumbly than a
typical Parmigiano-Reggiano.
</P>
<P>
   Changing Horses
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the years, David Ruggerio, the chef and owner of
Le Chantilly at 106 East 57th St. has gradually shifted the
restaurant's focus from classic French to more contemporary
American food. Now, he has really broken with the past: He has
changed the name to David Ruggerio and is redecorating the place.
</P>
<P>
   The murals showing horse-racing scenes from Chantilly have been
removed (Ruggerio said he is keeping them for some future use). And
when the restaurant, which is now temporarily closed, reopens at
the end of the month, the menu will even include some Italian
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   California-Southern
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In August, when the peach season is in full swing,
Bobby Ochs plans to open Peaches, at 206 East 63rd St. The
Georgia-born Marla Maples will be a partner in the restaurant,
which will combine California-style fare with some of Ms. Maples'
Southern favorites, like fresh trout and peach cobbler. The chef
will be Antonio Maroto, who was previously at Flowers in the
Flatiron district.
</P>
<P>
   Country in Town
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christina's Country Kitchen, 493 10th Ave. (37th
Street), is not a movie set. But with its weathered siding, sagging
porch and working water wheel, it looks like something you'd find
on some back road, not on a busy avenue. Christina Bierling, who
owns the Gold Rush Bar and Grill next door, said it had been a
storage building. It serves breakfast 24 hours a day; steak and
eggs are $10.95, and assorted omelets $4.95 to $6.95, all with
grits if you wish.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs on the Move
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Essex House has promoted Luc Dimnet, the
sous-chef at Les Celebrites, to chef de cuisine, replacing
Christian Delouvrier, who is moving to Lespinasse at the St. Regis.
Gray Kunz, the chef at Lespinasse, has announced his resignation,
effective July 26.

 &HT;    CLINTON TO UNVEIL ANTI-DRUG CAMPAIGN IN ATLANTA
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Launching the largest media campaign ever
undertaken by the federal government, President Clinton will unveil
a $2 billion national anti-drug program in Atlanta on Thursday(cq).
</P>
<P>
   Already tested in 12 cities, including Atlanta, the TV and radio
spots, billboard and newspaper displays, and Internet messages are
designed to counter a ``generational forgetting'' among young
people about the physical, social and psychological risks of drug
abuse, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year campaign will be so pervasive that the targeted
audience _ children between the ages of 9 and 18 and their parents
_ will see or hear an anti-drug message an average of four times
per week, the sponsors vow.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes several weeks after Gen. Barry McCaffrey,
director of the federal anti-drug agency, reported that while the
nation's crack cocaine epidemic appears to be waning, more young
people are using marijuana and heroin. Marijuana is gaining
popularity among middle school students, and many suburban
teen-agers mistakenly believe they can avoid heroin addiction by
sniffing or smoking the drug rather than injecting it.
</P>
<P>
   These trends illustrated the need for the new media campaign,
McCaffrey recently told the Senate Judiciary Committee. ``We have a
new generation of kids. We have to start over,'' he told the panel
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was chosen for the national launch because of the pilot
program's success there and because of the community's other active
anti-drug programs, said Bob Weiner, a spokesman for the drug
control office. Both Clinton and McCaffrey will participate in the
event at the World Congress Center from 9 to 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner said the president has been involved from the start in
the campaign, which features an assortment of ``powerful'' spots
crafted to pierce a teenager's armor of attitude and to overcome
the reluctance of many Baby Boomer parents who smoked pot in the
Sixties to discuss drugs with their children.
</P>
<P>
   One TV spot, for instance, begins with the now-familiar shot of
the frying pan featured in the earlier ``this is your brain on
drugs'' campaign, but then shows the frying pan being used to smash
a kitchen to illustrate the carnage that drugs inflict on a user's
family and friends. Another uses a ``mommy's'' dramatic silence to
push parents to talk to children at an early age about the dangers
of drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The federal drug agency deemed the eight-week pilot program a
success and will now take it national. While $195 million in
federal funding was allocated for the campaign's initial year, the
expanded effort is counting largely on $1.8 billion in donated
media time and space for the anti-drug messages. The combination
will ``lead to unprecedented exposure for anti-drug messages
targeting both youth and adults,'' predicted the drug control
agency.

MASTER CHEF: GIVING A RAGOUT A LITTLE FORM AND TEXTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: recipe at end of article) 
This is the third of eight columns by Deborah Madison, the former
chef at Greens in San Francisco and the author of ``Vegetarian
Cooking for Everyone.'' Her collaborator is Mark Bittman. 
(bl) 
 By DEBORAH MADISON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is nothing more satisfying than a warm stew or ragout.
Although they are among my favorite dishes, they are difficult to
serve at a serious restaurant. The very qualities that make them so
pleasing _ a comforting formlessness and simplicity _ also make
them less than elegant on the plate. And on a nice evening out,
elegant is what many people want.
</P>
<P>
   All of this explains why I was so taken by the noodle cakes I
saw in a Chinese restaurant years ago. The cakes were large, soft
pillows waiting to be served as beds for stir-fries. These
pan-fried cakes, I thought, could have a role in my own cooking,
but I would top them with a vegetable stew instead.
</P>
<P>
   What I like so much about the noodle cakes is that they do
indeed have a form, something for the eye to settle on. And since I
make mine with a crisp exterior, there's also something for the
knife and fork. In these two important ways _ form and texture _
noodle cakes seemed the perfect complement to tender braised
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   At first I modified the noodles only slightly, substituting
olive oil for the peanut oil used in Chinese cooking. Then I
discovered the cakes worked whether I used fresh noodles or dry,
Chinese or Italian, fat or thin _ although I do especially like the
look of the fine threads formed by capellini.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before I began to enliven their flavor with
herbs. Then I had the idea of laying half the noodles in the pan,
followed by some cheese and the remaining noodles. The result is a
crisp cake with a luxuriously creamy center. You can vary the
cheese _ and the herb, of course _ according to the vegetable
accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   I chose these vegetables because they are in season now. Small
eggplants combined with colorful peppers look wonderful and gain an
almost jammy sweetness after long cooking. You can make the dish
even more substantial by adding a few cubes of lamb, right from the
beginning, or finishing it with some tender white beans or
chickpeas.
</P>
<P>
   The time it takes to assemble this depends on how you choose to
work. Moving quickly, you can put together both noodle cake and
vegetables in less than an hour. If you prepare the noodle cake in
advance (it can be reheated), figure about 90 minutes.

</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   } cup minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 small eggplants (about 2 pounds), cut lengthwise into
quarters
</P>
<P>
   1 large red onion, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 large bell peppers (preferably 1 red and 1 orange or yellow),

<P>
   3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced

<P>
   2 teaspoons paprika

<P>
   2 tablespoons tomato paste

</P>
<P>
   1 cup or more freshly grated mozzarella, Gruyere or other
semisoft cheese, or a combination. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta
until it is tender but firm. Drain, rinse in cold water, and drain
again. Toss with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and { cup of the
parsley. Set aside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Put 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over
medium-high heat. Add the eggplants, and brown on all sides,
turning frequently, until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Put 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or
saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper and garlic.
Cook, stirring occasionally, until they soften. Add the paprika,
tomato paste, eggplants, tomatoes, the remaining parsley, and salt
and pepper to taste. Add the liquid gradually, scraping the pan to
loosen any browned bits. Cover, and turn heat to low. Cook,
stirring occasionally, until the mixture is quite thick and soft,
about 30 minutes.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Put 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a 10- or 12-inch
nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. After a minute, add half
the pasta, spreading them out with a spatula. Top with the cheese
and the remaining noodles, again spreading them out evenly. Lower
the heat to medium (the cake must not brown too fast), and cook,
shaking the pan occasionally, until the cake is lightly browned on
the bottom, 5 to 10 minutes. Slide it out onto a plate, top with
another plate, and invert. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. Add the remaining oil to skillet, and slide the cake back in,
cooked side up. Brown the second side, then remove to a platter. To
serve, place a wedge of noodle cake on a plate with some of the
stew alongside. &QL;

BY THE BOOK: VEGETABLE DISHES WITH SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By AMANDA HESSER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recipes for fennel, orange and walnut salad appear in many
cookbooks. But few of these recipes instruct you to rub the onions
with salt, which softens them and draws out any bitter juices, or
to toss the fennel with lemon juice, salt and pepper as soon as it
is sliced.
</P>
<P>
   The one in James Peterson's latest book, ``Vegetables'' (William
Morrow, $40), does. And this is exactly what makes his book such a
treasure, and so refreshingly different from the masses of
vegetable cookbooks on bookstore shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the recipes are simple _ sometimes too simple for an
experienced cook _ and familiar, but they are meticulously
formulated and carefully written. Reading them, you can imagine
Peterson like a scientist in his kitchen, diligently working out
just the right order in which to mix the ingredients in his tomato,
basil and macaroni salad or his summer Italian-style mixed
vegetable salad.
</P>
<P>
   The book, his first since ``Fish and Shellfish,'' for which he
won a Julia Child cookbook award in 1997, begins with sections on
each vegetable, with ample descriptions, shopping hints, a list of
recipes in which the vegetable appears in the book, trimming and
cooking instructions, and evocative but simple ideas for preparing
the vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in the section on avocados (which Peterson
acknowledges are in fact fruit), he offers this idea for enjoying
the essence of ripe avocados, peeled and cut into sections: ``Crush
them on slices of toasted and buttered French bread, and sprinkle
with a little lemon juice, salt and pepper for a light lunch or
afternoon snack.'' It made me run to the store for avocados, which,
to me, is the power of a well-written cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are organized by cooking style and technique, like
vegetable gratins and casseroles and pureed vegetables. It is a
system that fails now and then, in sections like ``Baked
Vegetables,'' which contains just two recipes. And some vegetables
seem to be neglected. For example, Peterson uses far more baby
artichokes than large ones. In New York, at least, large artichokes
are much more readily available than baby ones.
</P>
<P>
   But he easily compensates for these flaws with mounds of useful
information. There are easy-to-read charts for boiling, steaming
and grilling, broken down by individual vegetable, as well as a
chart revealing vegetable yields after cooking. A thorough list of
sources is provided for unusual ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The style of the recipes is at once current and traditional.
Vegetables prepared a la grecque hark back to classic French
cooking, while a small stream of Indian-influenced recipes, like a
delicious sweet potato salad, and dishes that seem inspired from a
trip to a greenmarket, like baked peppers stuffed with fresh
mozzarella and basil, give a contemporary feel to the book.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from minor mistakes, like not salting the pasta water for
orecchiette with broccoli rape (it was good anyway), the recipes
work quite well, adding strength to an already solidly researched
and well-executed cookbook.

   NEW YORK _ Among kitchen gadgets, the cherry pitter has one of
the narrowest roles. It does not slice cherries or remove their
stems. It only pits them. And even if you're an ambitious cook, you
use it maybe once a year.
</P>
<P>
   But a fresh cherry pie is almost impossible to make without one.
So, cherry pitters hang in stores all year, and then sell like
crazy during June and July, the cherry season.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, though, few gadget companies have figured out how to
design one that actually works.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular models looks and functions much like a
syringe. The cherry is placed on a round doughnut-shaped plate, and
a thin stainless-steel shaft on a spring is pushed down with the
thumb to pierce the cherry and push the pit out through the hole in
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   But the spring is so tight that by the time you have enough
cherries for a pie, you might also have carpal tunnel syndrome. And
the shaft is so thin that it often misses the pit _ especially in a
ripe cherry _ and you end up piercing the cherry so many times that
it is mutilated before the elusive pit finally decides to fall out.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Norpro and Fox Run Craftsmen versions of this pitter
are $2.29 at Zabar's, Broadway and 80th Street, (212) 787-2004. The
Cooks Club model, identical to those at Zabar's, is $2.99 at
Lechters stores around the city. In each case, the pitter worked on
the first try one of four times.
</P>
<P>
   Another standard design works more like a hand-held stapler. The
cherry is placed on a small doughnut-shaped plate, and when the two
sides of the pitter are squeezed together, a stainless-steel shaft
pierces the cherry and pushes the pit through the hole in the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Westmark Kernex cherry pitter, at Zabar's for $6.98, works
like this, but its plastic handle makes it feel flimsy. Large Bing
cherries hardly fit on the plate that holds the cherry, and the
hole in the plate is too small for some pits to fit through. So,
you have to hit the pit directly or it gets pushed to the side and
buried in the flesh of the cherry. Just one of four cherries I
pitted worked on the first try.
</P>
<P>
   Similar in design is the Leifheit cherry pitter, available at
Williams-Sonoma stores and from the store's catalog, (800)
541-2233, for $12.50. Of all the pitters I tried, it was by far the
best, with a pitting success rate of four out of four. Made
entirely of stainless steel, it is solid but not heavy. The shaft
that pierces the fruit and pushes the pit through the plate is
thick enough to grab hold of the pit and direct it out of the
cherry, not to the side. And it has a lever that holds the pitter
closed and compact for storage.
</P>
<P>
   But don't run out to buy a cherry pitter just yet; you may
already have a makeshift one that, to my mind, works better than
any of the gadgets. In the July/August issue of Cook's Illustrated
magazine, a reader suggests using a small star pastry tip (3/16 of
an inch in diameter, with five to seven points) to pit cherries.
The sharp tip, which is shaped like a cone and made of stainless
steel, is placed point upward on a work surface, and the cherry is
pushed over it, stem end down. In concept, it seems more like a
medieval dare: if you miss the pit, your fingers are slashed. But
it works unbelievably well _ just don't push down too hard, too
quickly. You can also use a smooth round pastry tip (3/16 of an
inch) instead of a star tip.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of the pastry-tip method are that you can control
the cherry better with your fingers and that the pit consistently
comes out easily and clean, held by the point of the pastry tip,
although it does split the cherry.
</P>
<P>
   And it leaves you with one less thing to have to stuff in that
gadget drawer. &QL;

WINE TASTINGS: A STRONG MERLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chateau St. Jean Merlot, Sonoma County, Calif., 1995. About $18.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau St. Jean made its reputation with a long series of
excellent chardonnays made by Dick Arrowood. There is a new
winemaker now, Steve Reeder, and while he is still producing fine
chardonnays, he might just make his name at St. Jean with red wines
like this 1995 merlot.
</P>
<P>
   Reeder is continuing the winery's practice of buying good grapes
from selected vineyards throughout Sonoma County. This wine is
composed of grapes from some of the best smaller appellations:
Alexander Valley, Knight's Valley, Sonoma Valley and Russian River
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Both cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc have been added for
structure. The wine spent 14 months in French and American oak, and
while it came in at a powerful 14.3 percent alcohol, it has a
velvety texture and a smooth, long finish.

THE PANDA BAR: FOR LICORICE LOVERS, A SUBLIME CONFECTION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Let me say this straight out: I love licorice and always have.
On Halloween, I was the kid avidly collecting the black jelly beans
as fast as my friends could discard them.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, like root beer, licorice is a strong flavor that you either
love or hate. While it seems to inspire squeals of disgust among
most American adults, it is beloved in Europe. So it's no wonder
that the best commercial licorice bar around, the Panda bar, comes
from Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Made of only natural ingredients _ molasses, wheat flour,
licorice extract (derived from the root of the licorice shrub) and
aniseed oil _ this soft, glistening bar, black outside and the
color of dry earth within, is a wonderfully pure example of
licorice flavor. By the way, no need to say ``black licorice'';
there is no other kind. Those red twisted ropes are simply flavored
candies, enjoyed by those who don't yet know the pleasures of the
real thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Panda bar is available at almost any health food shop and
many candy stores, and usually costs 50 cents to $1. &QL;

THE `MAGIC' QUESTION: IS PROPER ENGLISH BLACK OR WHITE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lifelong friend of mine called the other day to shoot the
breeze and to needle me about the haze, the heat and the horrible
doings in Jasper, Texas, when we began, as we often do, to delve
into, dissect and dispose of subjects large and small with speedy
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, we'd been transported back to our Chicago enclave,
and it wasn't until my live-in looked on in perplexed horror that I
was aware of our slippage into the netherworld of diction and
cultural expression.
</P>
<P>
   He: ``What it be like, brah?''
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``Just kickin', ma man. Wassup in A-Town?''
</P>
<P>
   He: ``Same-o sam-o, knowwhatI'msayin'? I gotta wait for some mo'
months before they come through on that promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``So, wassup wit that? Thought dat was promised.''
</P>
<P>
   He: ``Just another means in keepin' a brother down,
youknowwhatI'msayin'?''
</P>
<P>
   My friend Daryl is college-educated with a weighty resume of
fine work in banking, and, sure, I know exactly what he's saying.
Many may not, my loved one included. She often uses my bilingual
services as interpreter when Daryl and I are on one of our verbal
rolls, which is almost any time we're within each other's space.
</P>
<P>
   Ours is, to be precise, a black vernacular from the inner-city
section of the Midwest region, a kind of urban pacing of melodic
rhythms weaving speech and expression, where metaphors, similes and
nouns are literally turned into verbs, and the rest is merely
tossed in for primitive simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   I explain this in part to be serious and amusing because the
whole issue of ``Ebonics,'' or ``black English,'' took center stage
a couple of years back when an Oakland, Calif., school board pushed
for permission to teach black English not as a cultural dialect but
as a genetically based second language equal in stature to ordinary
English. The board figured it was the only way students could
academically progress.
</P>
<P>
   But many African-Americans were insulted by the district's move.
Criticism mounted, and the resolution crashed and burned.
</P>
<P>
   Buried under the rubble was a muffled debate about whether
critics of ``black English'' are merely wannabe-white black folk
seeking assimilation into the dominant culture.
</P>
<P>
   Well, such a debate has resurfaced, albeit in the underground
railroad of black thought (Internet, radio, black barbershops),
conjured by a former basketball player who never would have thought
he'd be part of a philosophical discussion on cultural linguistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Magic Hour,'' a syndicated talk show, is fronted by Earvin
``Magic'' Johnson. Surely you know the dude. A former college
b-baller who bolted out of Michigan State University early for NBA
riches.
</P>
<P>
   A businessman and millionaire many times over, Johnson is also a
brother from around the way and speaks that language accordingly.
After harsh, though relatively quiet, criticism of his language
skills during a brief stint as a sports commentator, Johnson knew
he had to be better prepared for his latest battle.
</P>
<P>
   He has been dutifully taking speech and diction lessons to
better communicate with his interviewees, his live audience and the
viewers his show desperately needs to survive in the competitive
late-night arena.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he slips. Johnson's way of saying ``dis'' for the
word ``this,'' dat for ``that,'' ``I shoulda,'' and ``all's I want
to do,'' has a good number of African-Americans rolling on the
floor while others cringe in the embarrassment of a black man
butchering the English language.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where the debate begins. There are some who believe
that black critics of black dialect are practicing a form of
self-hatred, choosing a white culture over their own and embracing
what they call a slave mentality. Johnson is perfectly fine, since
he's just talkin' like a brotha, ya know?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there's a reason for this. Johnson's dialect, as is
mine, is a mixture of accent and sentence construction handed down
from enslaved Africans who didn't speak English and weren't taught
it. Before you dismiss this as nonsense, consider that slaves
picked up words from masters intent on damning them to a
devastating cycle among the lower rungs of society. Some have made
it out over the years, while many have not.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl and I grew up in a poor, all-black neighborhood and were
educated in cash-strapped all-black schools _ my first ``educated''
peer was a white college roommate from a wealthy suburb whose word
usage was jarring to me but considered standard English by my
professors. He could barely understand a word I said, and I had to
adjust if my plans were to make it through journalism school.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For phone conversations with Daryl, black English is our adopted
mode of speech, a vernacular chosen with the knowledge that we're
both able to employ a more standardized language at will. Call us
sellouts if you so please, but our social mobility and respect
(from blacks as well as others) hinges on it, even though I have
yet to master ``ask'' without saying ``ax,'' and my editor often
appears confused when I'm excited and speaking quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it's like we're doomed. Past experience keeps
black Americans gravely suspicious of anyone wanting to change
anything about a way of life that's exclusive and therefore
empowering. Our radars will remain keen as long as we witness, for
instance, the dilution of the Spanish language in California
(bilingual classes will be no more) and other ills.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to adhere to such broken English for the sake of holding
onto cultural heritage is false hype and complete nonsense. It's
unfortunate that we continue to engage in ``who's blacker than
whom'' contests, attaching the preservation of one's cultural
history and identity to, of all things, poor grammar.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's talk show will go down in flames not because of dis
and dat, but because he is charming but not entertaining, and
late-night television simply isn't his thing. While I've never
talked with Johnson, I could see our private conversations dipping
into the black vernacular, both of us feeling quite comfortable
with the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   There is, in some ways, a sadness to this truth. But I'll settle
for the beauty of this exclusivity when it comes, particularly from
strangers. Like the other day. Upon leaving the office, a black
male city worker emptying the meters noticed me and said quickly,
``Wassup, brah?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothin' much, ma man,'' I told him. ``Nothin' much.''

   NEW YORK _ On Sunday, in anticipation of Bastille Day, waiters
from New York's French restaurants will walk the walk. Slowed down
by a long waiter's apron, they will race back and forth four times
between Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue on 60th Street, balancing a
tray that holds two filled plastic glasses and a bottle of _ say
what?
</P>
<P>
   Look closely. It's Pineau des Charentes, an aperitif that needs
no introduction in France but remains a sort of wine-world trivia
question here. Too bad, because Pineau des Charentes, a fruity,
fragrant blend of Cognac and unfermented grape juice, brilliantly
performs the predinner task that a glass of chardonnay was never
really meant to do. Served chilled, it cossets and stimulates the
taste buds with a honeyed, nectarine sweetness that refuses to
cloy.
</P>
<P>
   Pineau des Charentes comes in two versions, a blond and a
ruby-color rose, which is a rarity in the United States. Styles
differ from house to house. The pineau of Pierre Ferrand, light and
restrained, has a delicate, floral aroma. Prunier produces a
Sauternes-like pineau with ripe apricot flavors. A. de Fussigny's
is slightly pruny. All three cost between $20 and $25. Other easily
found pineaus are Marnier, Bernard Boutinet and Reynac.

   Nearly two decades after the ruins of the emperor Nero's lavish
Domus Aurea palace in the heart of Rome were closed for a
preservation project, the site will be reopened. Italy's Culture
Ministry says the palace will welcome visitors on June 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When built, the palace occupied one-quarter of the city and
included a lake, several gardens and a residence so lavish that it
was dubbed the Domus Aurea, or Golden House. Since the early 1980s,
experts have been working to ensure that the palace, built by Nero
after the fire that devastated Rome in A.D. 64, is preserved from
the ravages of humidity and shifting earth.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain and thunder will be common in the northern
Appalachians and southern New England as low pressure tracks east
across upstate New York. The merging of three streams of moist air
over the Northeast will result in flooding rains from the Hudson
Valley to Cape Cod. A cool, damp air current from the North
Atlantic will keep much of New England near 70 degrees. Sultry
weather from the South will direct tropical air into the Middle
Atlantic region. A mild, moist flow from the northwest will add
further moisture to the already saturated air.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and strong thunderstorms will erupt in the steamy air
mass over the Southeast, particularly in the Appalachians and
Piedmont plateau. Near record heat is expected again along the
Coast and in northern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A weak cold front pushing south into the Ohio Valley will mark
the leading edge of somewhat less humid air. A second cold front
poised north of the Great Lakes represents an advancing cooler air
mass, which will sweep into the Northeast on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Humid air ascending the central Plains will be injected with
torrid air from Texas in the presence of a jet stream disturbance.
The result will be a large cluster of strong to severe
thunderstorms over Kansas, Colorado and western Nebraska. A few
storms will develop from the Red River Valley to the Tennessee
Valley. Afternoon thunderheads will form over the southern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The West will be dominated by high pressure which will sponsor
considerable sunshine and above seasonal temperatures. Fog will
stay near the Northwest coast.

   Focus: Tardy Heat

   Monday passed at Fresno, Calif., without temperatures reaching
100 degrees, setting the city's all-time record for the latest date
without a triple-digit reading. Fresno's mark followed on the heels
of a similar record set at Bakersfield on Sunday. Both cities lie
in the San Joaquin Valley, which is sheltered from routine sea
breezes by coastal mountains. Under relentless sunshine and with
nary a cooling thunderstorm, average daytime highs in the valley
climb into the upper 90s by the end of July, with triple-digit
readings typically already logged into weather annals much
earlier. &QL;

has led to concerns that there will be diminished competition in
the marketplace; that the free market of ideas will in some manners
be constrained, and that consolidation within these industries will
dampen innovation and creativity,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio,
the panel's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Chief Executive Officer C. Michael Armstrong tried to
soothe government concerns and discourage efforts to regulate the
changing telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to offer all consumers the broadest array of
communications services that are modular in choice, simple to use,
and affordable to enjoy,'' Armstrong told the panel. ``But this
merger is only a step in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong and others stressed the need to build the combined
phone, cable and Internet services into a universal system
customers can use to link to various resources.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems President John Marselle said he feared
competitors wouldn't stick to an open system. Sun developed the
universal Java computer language, and Marselle warned against a
Microsoft-like stronghold dominating the new medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I constantly worry about the choke point,'' Marselle said,
meaning the place where an information provider can restrict
access, usually by creating a product that cannot read a
competitor's work.
</P>
<P>
   Marselle asked the panel to prevent a shift to a dominant system
that would not be universally accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can count on that because it's in our own self-interest,''
Armstrong said about maintaining an open system. For example,
Armstrong said that if subscribers to AT&AMP;T and TCI's new menu of
services would rather use outside Internet provider instead of the
one they provide, it would benefit both companies to let users sign
on. Otherwise, both could loose customers and money.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the promise of maintaining an open system, DeWine
said it concerned him that so many news organizations are owned by
private businesses, such as the partnership between ABC and Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it possible,'' DeWine asked, ``that you can become so
integrated and have so much cross-ownership you won't be able to
make objective decisions?''
</P>
<P>
   Television executives Robert Iger, president of ABC, and Richard
Parsons, president of Time Warner, assured committee members the
media mergers would not endanger the network's news departments or
restrict editorial judgement.
</P>
<P>
   ``News needs to maintain its independence and objectivity,''
Iger said. Despite ABC's merger with Disney, he said ABC reporters
continue to provide detailed and objective coverage of Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons said in some cases, the larger corporations formed by
the merger can compete where smaller companies can't. Using Time
Warner's CNN as an example, Parsons said only a large conglomerate
could have launched the network's two major competitors, the Fox
News Channel and MSNBC.

 &HT;    MEDIA MERGERS NEEDN'T RESTRICT MARKETPLACE, CONGRESS TOLD

   WASHINGTON _ Unless new telecommunications giants block access
to a competitor's channels or Internet servers, mergers between
telephone companies, cable services and entertainment conglomerates
will give customers a wider variety of services in one convenient,
affordable package, industry experts told a Senate panel Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The recent proposed merger of the AT&AMP;T long-distance giant and
the cable provider TCI prompted the hearing by the Senate Judiciary
antitrust subcommittee to look at the benefits and drawbacks of
media consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wave of mergers that has swept across American industry

   &UR;  &LR; Because of a reporting error, the circumstances under which
Representative Barney Frank publicly disclosed his homosexuality in
1987 were mischaracterized in a Boston Globe story. Allegations
stemming from Frank's relationship with Steven Gobie, a male
prostitute, had yet to surface at the time of Frank's disclosure.
However, Frank later said he chose to acknowledge his homosexuality
partly because of his problematic relationship with Gobie, which
began in 1985 and ended several months after Frank's disclosure.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The morning sun that flooded Isabel Allende's kitchen was as
innocent and unblemished as a perfect egg yolk. It slid across the
counter of hand-painted tiles and made her dangling silver earrings
sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Allende, the Chilean novelist, was, for the moment,
immune to the poetry and the pleasure of the warm sun. She was in
the middle of an atavistic ritual that might have made a scene in
one of her seven books.
</P>
<P>
   She was cooking Sunday lunch for her husband, her son and his
fiancee, and any of her large extended family who might clamber up
the steps to her modern house perched on a hill above San Francisco
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Tending family tradition is second nature to Ms. Allende. So is
breaking rules. She was cooking up aphrodisiacs, family style.
</P>
<P>
   And she saw nothing odd in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love and sympathy keep us close,'' she said. And the spirits
who inhabit the magical reality of her fiction would approve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only governments and churches are afraid of human pleasure,''
said Ms. Allende, 56, whose first book, ``The House of the
Spirits,'' catapulted her in 1985 from the small world of feminist
journalism in Chile to international best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aphrodite: A Memoir of the Senses,'' published this spring
(Harper Flamingo, $26), added food _ specifically, its erotic
possibilities _ to the milieu of love and war Ms. Allende had
already claimed.
</P>
<P>
   To her, Eros is a magical life force, a subtle sensibility, not
some crass, hyperactive satyr. ``Erotic is using a feather,'' she
said. ``Pornography is when you use the whole bird.''
</P>
<P>
   By weaving together folklore, literature and her own experience,
Ms. Allende opens the door of Aphrodite's pantry. There, an almond
is not a nut, but a myth-drenched symbol of femininity. And black
pepper is not merely a seasoning, but an aliment that can cheer
widows and aid the impotent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a practical book,'' she writes in ``Aphrodite.'' ``We
know how difficult it is to find paws of koala, eye of salamander
and urine of a virgin _ three species on the endangered list.''
</P>
<P>
   Her old-fashioned recipes are simple, mostly because she is a
practical person. Her dishes, like crepes suzette and coq au vin,
recall the coffee-tea-or-me 1960s in America, when frumpy French
cooking defined elegance and the sensual aspects of eating were not
polite conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, food has become sexier than sex in the United
States, so Ms. Allende's thesis is less than startling. But the
stimulating potential of dinner was new to the author, an outspoken
feminist and unreconstructed seductress.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Allende, the writing of this book was part of a
rediscovery of the senses after a personal tragedy. Seven years
ago, her daughter, Paula, developed a rare and fatal illness, and
since then Ms. Allende hasn't written any fiction. After Paula's
death in 1992, ``the world was flat, gray, completely lifeless,''
she said as she whisked several dozen eggs to a fine foam.
</P>
<P>
   Only when she began to dream about food _ of diving into an
ocean of rice pudding, for example, or of slathering a handsome man
with guacamole and tucking him in a corn tortilla _ did Ms. Allende
realize it was possible to emerge from the long tunnel of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   And with maturity, food can be, if not a fountain of youth, at
least a wellspring of desire. ``When you are young, you don't need
anything but passion,'' she said. ``As I get older I find that I
need to stir the juices a little. You know, life becomes more
complicated, days can slip by without an embrace.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Dinner starts to figure a little more prominently
in the mating dance, if you know what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   As she stood there at the stove, she looked like a cross between
Bianca Jagger and a Diego Rivera mother bountiful. Her diaphanous
black silk skirt swished against her ankle-high boots. Her snug
burgundy sweater traced the rise of her ribs as she inhaled the
scent from a simmering pot of husky mushroom soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reconciliation soup,'' she said. ``I always fix it after some
terrible fight. It's a flag of truce that allows me to make peace
without humiliating myself too much. My opponent only has to smell
the soup to understand the message.'' The smell was of wild
mushrooms infused with garlic.
</P>
<P>
   She had prepared a salad of pears with Roquefort sauce. This
cheese, she said, is too ripe and pungent not to be an aphrodisiac.
She began arranging the pears on the salad plates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, the only thing that really works is love,
affection and presentation,'' she said. A descendant of one of
Chile's most venerable families, Ms. Allende grew up in the
sprawling family compound in Santiago, where disdain of earthly
pleasures was a virtue. But when she was 9, her life took a turn
away from the restraints of upper-class Catholicism. Her mother,
who had divorced her first husband, remarried, and her second
husband was both a diplomat and a bon-viveur. The family table was
transformed into an opulent buffet.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in her work as a television commentator and left-leaning
feminist writer, Chile's political unrest swirled around her (her
uncle was Salvador Allende Gossens, the socialist president, who
was toppled by the military in 1973), the family fortunes shifted,
and food became hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she remained in Chile until she heard the sound of the
secret police's cars in the night before fleeing to Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved into the same building as my mother, who had a
perpetual contest with Berta, her cook,'' Ms. Allende said.
``Slowly, I started to think of cooking in a new way.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first marriage ended, and in 1990 she moved to the United
States and married Willie Gordon, a California lawyer. At first, he
did all the cooking. Until 1990, Ms. Allende published novels with
breakneck frequency _ and she never made a meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to realize that Willie always served the same menu,
always something grilled,'' she said. ``So I started fancy soups or
appetizers or dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``I spend my youth worrying about things like
feminism and guerrillas. Then I get into my 50's and I start to
realize that the weaknesses of the flesh that tempt me most are
not, alas, alas, the ones I've practiced the most.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, it was almost 2 p.m., time for Ms. Allende to shoo her
swarming family out of the kitchen so she could tend to the
omelets.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the task of congealing the outer surface of the beaten
eggs into a fragile net seemed more daunting than writing a novel.
But stirring, tipping and calibrating the flame, she turned out one
half-moon of tenderness after another.
</P>
<P>
   Contemplating the row of six quivering omelets, Ms. Allende
flushed. As steam beaded on them like sweat and caviar oozed from
their centers, Ms. Allende called her family to lunch.

THE FRENCH, WHO AGREE ON NOTHING, UNITE BEHIND A SOCCER TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A strange thing has happened on the way to the World Cup
final: this fractious country, never in agreement about anything,
eternally divided, deeply skeptical, has united around a soccer
team that is now lauded by workers, women and even intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup had been approached with the usual grumbling.
There was the cost: $433 million for the main stadium alone. There
were the predictable Left Bank comments about the inanity of eleven
grown men chasing a ball. And there were the dismal pre-tournament
showings of the French team, confirmation, if any were needed, that
an early exit was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   There was also something deeper. This is a country that has
traditionally been touched by the individual endurance of the Tour
de France bicycle race, by the rugged splendor of rugby and by the
grace and elegance of the Roland Garros tennis tournament. As for
``le foot,'' it was foolish.
</P>
<P>
   But a shift has occurred, fleeting perhaps, remarkable without
doubt. In the place of the dismissive ``bof,'' accompanied by
Gallic shrug, a wave of enthusiasm has engulfed the French as their
team, on home ground, has reached the semifinal, a stage it has
reached on three previous occasions only to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   This time, says coach Aime Jacquet, ``we are going all the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how far France does go will be decided in Wednesday's
semifinal against Croatia. Meanwhile, the team has already become
the upbeat symbol of a country that is experiencing sturdy economic
growth for the first time in years and appears to be emerging from
a protracted bout of the blues.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarterfinal match against Italy last Friday, played
at 4:30 p.m., the country shut down. Renault and Citroen plants
were closed. The employees of the ministry of solidarity and
employment sat watching the match on a large screen with their
minister, Martine Aubry. Cafes were full of cheering fans. When the
game was finally won in a penalty shootout, the Champs Elysees
became the scene of joyous mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not too enthusiastic at first, but then this strange
fever grabs you,'' said Frederique Chevalier, who works for an
airline company. ``There is a strange atmosphere at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys suggest that women like Ms. Chevalier have by no means
shunned the World Cup, as expected before the tournament started.
While most men have watched at least eight games, a majority of
women have seen at least four, according to media research centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the tournament started, I did not know anybody who
believed we could reach the final,'' said Noel Henoeque. ``But I
always thought we could do it and I still do.'' Henoeque has found
one of more than 15,000 temporary jobs generated by the world cup,
serving coffee at a stand of one of the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   With such enthusiasm prevailing, and jobs even being created, it
was only natural that ``le foot'' be suddenly elevated to the realm
of political debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I salute the unity of a team representative of French
diversity,'' Lionel Jospin, the socialist prime minister, said this
week. Referring to the sons of North African immigrants known as
``Beurs,'' he added, ``When I see Blacks and Beurs, with the French
flag, singing the Marseillaise, I find that these are timely
images.''
</P>
<P>
   France has been deeply concerned for some time with the apparent
fragmentation of its republican ideal, the model that allowed
generations of Portuguese, Italian and other immigrants to be
transformed into patriotic French citizens largely through an
excellent public school system.
</P>
<P>
   High unemployment and the spread of bleak suburbs populated
largely by out-of-work immigrants have dented this ideal.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is a soccer team to suggest that integration still
works in France. Zinedine Zidane, the star midfielder, is of
Algerian descent. Marcel Dessailly and Lilian Thuram, two members
of a four-man defense that has conceded only one goal in five
matches, are black. David Trezeguet, a striker, was born in
Argentina. Youri Djorkaeff, another striker, is of Georgian origin.
The contrast with the monochrome German and Italian teams had
indeed been striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hybrid team thumbs its nose at the National Front,''
Francois Armanet wrote this week in the daily Liberation, referring
to the xenophobic right-wing party that takes about 15 percent of
the French vote. ``One can admire it without chauvinism. These
players belong fully to the modern world.''
</P>
<P>
   Even intellectuals and writers, who once scoffed, have
discovered that soccer is an area for exhilarating debate. Where
soccer was once dismissed as a mere ``opium of the people,''
exploited by dictatorships intent on distracting their peoples, it
has now been elevated to a higher plane.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the writer Christophe Gallaz opined this week that, ``When
we applaud Youri Djorkaeff sprinting diagonally across the opposing
defense and scoring, we are consoled about our impotence before our
own objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was intriguing. Unfortunately Djorkaeff has in fact
proved largely impotent before his own objectives, scoring just one
goal in the World Cup, and that from a penalty. But when soccer
enters the realm of psychology, it is a fair certainty that it has
at last penetrated the inner sanctum of French intellectual debate.
</P>
<P>
   Several decades ago, the French writer Albert Camus observed
that, ``All I know about morality and the duties we all have I owe
to soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recent days, his was a voice in the wilderness, but now
France has found a new popular identity. If the country can beat
Croatia and reach its first ever final, who knows what may happen. &QL;

by a like amount. The budget was finally passed 17 days after the
July 1 deadline. The next year, the wrangling was even worse, with
a record 63-day standoff over how to spread the pain. Now Wilson is
in his last year in office, contemplating another run for the White
House and eager to leave a legacy _ and California is once again
without a budget one week into the new fiscal year. But this time,

TRYING TO AVOID MELTDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The paper said that June was the hottest month on record, but
what I want to know is why.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if June was the hottest month on record, there is no
reason why July won't be hotter still and August even hotter than
that, until, by September, we're all baked down to carbon-based
life forms the size of charcoal briquettes.
</P>
<P>
   And if everybody is reduced to glowing lumps of coal, we will
not be able to take advantage of our upcoming ``tax holiday,''
brought to us courtesy of the Florida Legislature (motto: No Stunt
Too Stupid If It Gets Us Re-elected), whereby we can save up to
$3.50 on the purchase of our next bowling shirt, but not our next
pair of bowling shoes, or perhaps it's the other way around. I'm
not sure. (Zippers will be taxed but belts will not, but what use
is a tax-free belt to someone who's a charcoal briquette?)
</P>
<P>
   So, you see, it's imperative that we find out why June was the
hottest month on record and correct the problem by mid-August so we
can all drive across town to the mall on congested, potholed
streets, past the overcrowded schools and under-funded police
department, in order to avoid paying the tax on a $50 fur coat.
(Don't tell the clerk you're going to wear your $50 fur coat as a
Halloween costume because then you'll have to pay sales tax.)
</P>
<P>
   I've been trying to think if there was anything I did,
personally, to cause June's record heat wave. I know that if my car
has been sitting in the sun all day and I open the door, a blast of
super-heated air smacks me in the face like solar wind, singing my
nose hairs and fusing the frames of my glasses onto my temples. If
everybody in Florida opened their car doors at the same time, I
expect the polar ice cap would melt and people in Iowa would find
themselves owning beachfront property.
</P>
<P>
   But I opened my car door no differently this June than I did in
Junes past, so I can't see how this could account for the record
heat.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, but not likely, that the tearing down of
Ringling Towers caused the heat wave. Demolishing an historic
landmark generates a lot of civic angst, but, to my knowledge, it
has not been scientifically proven that civic angst affects the
daytime highs or causes any other sort of climatic changes that
would lead to record-setting heat.
</P>
<P>
   Rampant cell phone use could have nudged the thermometer up a
degree or two, but, again, the scientific basis for this claim is
dubious at best. However, cell phone users can be irritating, like
when you're waiting in line at the convenience store to buy a
lottery ticket and some clown in front of you is calling his
girlfriend to find out if she wants the regular Slim Jims or the
spicy.
</P>
<P>
   But what part cell-phone-related irritation played in last
month's heat wave is a matter of conjecture, and, to tell the
truth, it is probably no greater an influence than the irritation
caused by the U.S. soccer team, talk radio or Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   (Would it be constitutionally permissible to outlaw the
McLaughlin Group if it was found that feuding pundits contributed
to global warming?)
</P>
<P>
   If push came to shove (and let's hope it doesn't in this heat)
and I had to choose the one thing that was most responsible for
last month's miserable weather, it would be sport utility vehicles.
Not only do they spew out more heat-trapping emissions than other
cars, the people who drive them own a disproportionate number of
cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to record heat, with no relief in sight.
</P>

BIRTH CONTROL UNDER ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Conservative House Republicans are expanding their
rampage through the nation's bedrooms by adding an assault on birth
control, which millions of couples use to limit the size and timing
of their families.
</P>
<P>
   This assault, part of their ideological war on abortion, is a
stunningly stupid move, as illogical as it is politically obtuse.
</P>
<P>
   If the goal is really to reduce the number of abortions, it is
counter-productive to interfere with prescription contraception
methods, such as the pill, that allow women to prevent an unwanted
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take Albert Einstein to figure out cause and effect
here. No pregnancy, no panicky rush to an abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have no business trying to legislate morality or
meddling in the private sex lives of constituents. That would not
seem to be a popular maneuver with couples of child-bearing age
struggling to make ends meet in an economy that calls for
two-earner households.
</P>
<P>
   Contraception is safe and legal; by freeing women from unplanned
or untimely motherhood, the pill and other devices have extended
economic and cultural opportunities for our gender and made our
advancement in the workplace possible.
</P>
<P>
   The House anti-abortion zealots are pandering to the religious
right, which increasingly exerts a stranglehold on the GOP even
though its extremist social positions are outside the political
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Their theological view is that life begins at the moment of
fertilization, instantly creating a human being with rights equal
or superior to that of the living mother-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, they oppose birth control devices that can prevent a
fertilized egg from implanting and growing in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   That view is not shared by most Protestant and Jewish
theologians, who believe that an embryo is not a human until life
has quickened and can survive outside the mother's body, in the
third trimester of the pregnancy. Indeed, the Supreme Court decreed
that abortion is legal because an early fetus is only ``potential''
life. The high bench actually took the competing rights of the
woman into consideration, which the anti-abortion crowd never does.
</P>
<P>
   The House returns from vacation with birth control issues still
on its agenda. But the Senate has yet to grapple with such
questions, and may never do so. Fortunately, that august body is
believed to possess enough common sense to stay away from them.
</P>
<P>
   The opening salvo was recent House approval of an amendment to
an agricultural spending bill that forbids the Food and Drug
Administration from researching, testing or approving any
contraceptive that interferes with pregnancy after fertilization.
The measure was specifically aimed at RU-486, a French drug in wide
usage in Europe that the FDA has ruled safe and effective but has
not yet given final marketing approval.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing at the altar of fertilization, the anti-abortion crowd
would deny women access to a nonsurgical, humane ``morning after
pill'' and force them to either bear an unwanted child or have an
invasive early pregnancy abortion. This is not about killing
babies; it is about protecting women's health.
</P>
<P>
   A second legislative proposal still pending would require
civilian federal employee health insurance plans to cover the cost
of prescription contraceptives. Most plans now do not. The
provision, sponsored by Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., would benefit some
1.2 million women who are federal employees or covered under the
health plans of federal workers.
</P>
<P>
   GOP conservatives have vowed to defeat it and temporarily
blocked it before Congress went on vacation in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowey proposal is attached to an essential spending bill
that contains operating funds for the Treasury Department, the
White House and several federal agencies. Congress must pass it in
some form, with or without the Lowey amendment.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult for President Clinton to veto the whole
thing just to protest the absence of the Lowey proposal. He has
vowed not to approve funding for the United Nations or the
International Monetary Fund so long as that funding legislation
contains a ban on U.S. funds for international organizations that
support family planning.
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure extending insurance coverage of birth control
prescriptions to all corporate health insurance plans has been
proposed in the Senate, but no hearings have yet been held.
</P>
<P>
   The third effort to cut off safe options for preventing
pregnancy is an amendment to another spending bill that would
require clinics receiving federal funds to notify parents in
advance before prescribing contraceptives to minors.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, flies in the face of logic. Teenagers are notoriously
reluctant to tell their parents if they are sexually active,
parents being a bit stuffy about the behavioral purity of their
little darlings.
</P>
<P>
   That means no clinic visit and no pregnancy protection. This is
not the way to make abortion less frequent.
</P>
<P>
   The new focus on preventing family planning is a sad development
for the Republican party, women, and the country. The politicians
ought to come to their senses and back off.

MICHAEL D. PAPAGIANNIS, 65; LED SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael D. Papagiannis led an international effort to find
intelligent extraterrestrial life. He died Thursday of
complications from Alzheimer's disease in Naples, Fla., before that
effort bore fruit. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   In a story published in the Boston Globe on March 25, 1985, the
longtime professor of astronomy at Boston University was asked if
he would prefer to live before or after the discovery of a signal
from an extraterrestrial civilization. He said he would choose to
live before. ``Some cooks may feel this way,'' he said. ``It is
more exciting to prepare the dish than to eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Papagiannis was the former director of the International
Astronomical Union's commission on the search for extraterrestrial
life, a search conducted primarily by radio, listening for
transmissions from outside our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   In a story published in the January 1983 issue of Boston
magazine, he discussed the difficulty of the task. ``The problem is
colossal,'' he said. ``There are millions of stars to aim at, and
we have no idea at what frequency someone might be sending us
signals. Imagine driving your car in another state and trying to
tune in to a radio station you like, and then multiply this by a
factor of a billion or more and you'll have an idea of what we're
up against.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Athens, where he graduated from the National
Polytechnic University. He earned a master's degree in physics at
the University of Virginia and a doctorate in physics and astronomy
at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of several books, including ``Space Physics
and Space Astronomy'' and ``Strategies for the Search for Life in
the Universe,'' and was editor of ``Search for Extraterrestrial
Life: Recent Developments.''
</P>
<P>
   He taught at Boston University from 1964 until his retirement in
1994 and was chairman of its astronomy department from 1969 to
1982. When he retired, the astronomy library at the school was
named in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Elizabeth Haines-Papagiannis; his first
wife, Mary Hutton; a son, Dimitrios, of Pasadena, Calif.; a
daughter, Christina McCauley of Weymouth, Mass.; and four
grandchildren.

`BEYOND BELIEF': A RETURN VISITOR'S LOOK AT FOUR ISLAMIC
SOCIETIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been 30 years now that V.S. Naipaul, born in Trinidad but
of Indian ancestry, has been writing books about Third World
civilizations in the postcolonial era, the books based on long
travels to far-flung points on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   His penetrating, opinionated travel writing, added to his
novels, makes up a remarkable running commentary on the clash of
civilizations, or, perhaps more accurately, on the self-inflicted
wounds of the countries emerging from foreign domination.
</P>
<P>
   His new book, ``Beyond Belief,'' is another in the
wounded-civilization series, one that harks back almost two decades
to another voyage and another book, ``Among the Believers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier work, Naipaul traveled to Indonesia, Iran,
Pakistan and Malaysia, the major countries to which Islam was not a
native religion but was imposed by what might be called Arabian
spiritual imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the Believers'' was a portrait of a group of societies
that turned to Islam partly to reject pasts, especially colonial
pasts, that were deemed inauthentic by local revolutionaries. But
in so doing, these societies adopted a foreign creed that was also
inauthentic and that replicated the injustices that had motivated
the revolutionaries in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Similar themes appear in ``Beyond Belief,'' which is an account
of return visits Naipaul made to the same countries and to many of
the same people of ``Among the Believers.''
</P>
<P>
   But while much of the writing in the new book is memorably
Naipaulian, Naipaul himself is less present on the scene than he
was in his earlier work. He writes almost entirely through the eyes
of the numerous people in the four countries whose stories he
tells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond Belief'' is unusual travel writing in this willed
semi-disappearance of this distinguished author, his determination
to substitute for his own voice the voices he encounters.
</P>
<P>
   The result is often an extremely interesting, intimate and
valuable set of portraits, even if ``Beyond Belief'' is also
analytically vague, abstract despite the concreteness of its
descriptions. In addition, the very large number of Naipaul's
portraits, along with the considerable, seemingly unedited length
of them, is sometimes wearying.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are numerous brilliant moments in ``Beyond
Belief,'' which represents a powerfully observed, stylistically
elegant exploration of the four Islamic countries Naipaul visited.
</P>
<P>
   He begins in Indonesia with a certain Imaduddin, whom Naipaul
knew in 1979 as an Islamicist opponent of the corrupt Suharto
regime. By the time of this return visit to him, Imaduddin has
become an establishment figure, an avatar of an Islamicist future
embraced by the authorities. ``I felt in 1979 that the religion was
under threat,'' he tells Naipaul. ``Now I have my friends in the
Cabinet. It's God's will.''
</P>
<P>
   Imaduddin represents the continued emergence of Islam not just
as a set of religious beliefs but as the basis for government. The
country where that is clearest and where that trend has most
conspicuously advanced is obviously Iran, about which Naipaul's
reporting is especially nuanced and sharp.
</P>
<P>
   His previous visit, he reminds us, came when Iranian students
had seized the American Embassy in Tehran and revolutionary fervor
was at its highest. Since then, the devastating eight-year war with
Iraq and the death of Ayatollah Khomeini have intervened, and both
have sharpened the contradiction that always lay at the heart of
the Iranian revolution: that between the powerful forces of
conservative theocracy on one side, and, on the other, the desire
for respite, a fatigue with the revolution, and the emergence of
various sorts of rebellions, especially among the youth.
</P>
<P>
   What Naipaul does with great effect in his chapters on Iran and
Pakistan is show this contradiction in very particular, personal
terms. He meets the editor of an English-language newspaper he
first met in 1979 and learns from him the fate of a Jaffrey, whom
Naipaul also met in his earlier travels.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffrey, a Muslim who yearned for an Islamic society that
represented his religious values, moved from India to Pakistan and
then from Pakistan to Iran in search of it. But the student
occupiers of the American Embassy found payment receipts to him,
which represented some part-time work he did for the Voice of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Since any contact with Americans was deemed to be the work of
spies, Jaffrey, in the years since Naipaul last saw him, fled back
to Pakistan, his dream of an Islamic paradise-on-earth obviously
betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Naipaul interviews veterans of the war with Iraq who express
their disillusionment to him, their sense of being manipulated by
the mullahs into a superstitious frenzy. He visits Ayatollah
Khalkhalli, the notorious hanging judge of 1979, and finds him
partly broken and out of power but also arrogant, unrepentant and
difficult. Naipaul finds the 19-year-old brother of an Iraqi war
veteran named Feyredoun, who had filled in the Iranian void with a
singular kind of rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just five or six years younger than Feyredoun, but he
belonged to a different generation,'' Naipaul writes. ``While there
were serious books on Feyredoun's side of the wall, on his
brother's side there were photographs of football teams and a
`heavy metal' pop group, and a swastika. Feyredoun's brother was a
Nazi. He said that as an Iranian he was Aryan; therefore he was a
Nazi. And he took being a Nazi seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, Naipaul tells, among others, the story of a
frustrated lawyer named Rana, a former guerrilla fighter named
Shahbaz and a journalist named Rahimullah Yusufzai, who attained
considerable local fame reporting on the Afghan war and its
aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the theme of these encounters, how each of these figures
and the others we meet in these pages illustrate Naipaul's concept
of Islam among the converted peoples, is not clear. But the
portraits are nonetheless vivid and concrete and add to the
enormous and remarkable body of work by Naipaul _ a record of
intelligent observation that promises to be an enduring literary
achievement.

APHRODITE HASEOTES, 96; HEADED CUMBERLAND FARMS FAMILY FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aphrodite (Bassis) Haseotes, matriarch of the Haseotes clan,
which owns and operates the Cumberland Farms chain of convenience
stores and gas stations, died Sunday in Bay Path Nursing home in
Duxbury, Mass. She was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Haseotes and her late husband, Vasilios, parlayed a couple
of cows on a dairy farm in Rhode Island into a convenience store
chain with about 1,000 outlets across the country.
</P>
<P>
   She was senior vice president of Cumberland Farms and was widely
regarded as the power behind the throne at the multi-million dollar
family-owned conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in the village of Nymfeon in Macedonia, Greece, in
1902. She immigrated to the United States when she was 7 years old.
She and her husband, also a Greek immigrant, lived in Providence
until 1938, when Mr. Haseotes took the savings he had accumulated
by working in bakeries and selling fruit and vegetables and bought
a large tract of wooded land in Cumberland, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after they acquired the property, they bought a cow and
calf. It took them three years to pay off the $84 they paid for the
animals.
</P>
<P>
   They opened their first jug milk store in Bellingham, Mass. in
1956. Cumberland Farms was incorporated in 1957. By 1968 there were
500 stores. The first gas station was added to a store in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Growth accelerated during the Arab oil embargo in the mid-1970s,
when Cumberland swallowed up choice store and service station sites
abandoned by the major gasoline dealers in the Northeast and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, when she was 74, the conglomerate consisted of 17
corporate entities. In a story published in the Boston Globe on
Oct. 10, 1976, her children made it clear that she was a major

biased, and discourages complaints by refusing to release any
information about cases; that police and the city attorney's office
don't release information and keep inadequate records; and that
Police Chief Beverly Harvard's responses were ``oblique.'' The

workers should stop being so demanding and ``lazy'' and get back to
work -- so that his people can also resume their jobs here. As a
result of the GM strike in the United States, most of the 2,500 GM
workers at a plant in Silao have been idled with only 50 percent
pay. Auto parts from the United States are no longer coming into
Mexico, and unfinished trucks are stacking up outside a sprawling
six-year-old factory here. Mexican workers, who are paid about $12
a day or less, are starting to get worried. Thousands of other
Mexicans who work for GM-owned Delphi auto parts plants scattered
across northern Mexico have also been idled with partial pay.
Striking American workers fear that GM wants to move even more
aggressively into Mexico, where labor is much cheaper. Analysts say
they're right. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

REPORT SAYS IMMIGRANTS GIVE MORE TO THE COUNTRY THAN THEY RECEIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Immigrants pay more in taxes than they receive in
benefits, but most of that money is going to the federal government
and is bypassing the states and cities hit hardest by their
arrival, according to a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, produced by the National Immigration Forum (NIF) and
the Cato Institute, said immigrants paid roughly $133 billion in
federal, state and local taxes in 1997, more than 8 percent of the
total. The figure included taxes on income and sales.
</P>
<P>
   However, the costs and benefits of immigrants are not spread
evenly among federal, state and local governments, according to
Stephen Moore, author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government tends to receive about two-thirds of the
taxes paid by the immigrants, with the remaining one-third going to
state and local governments, according to the report, which was
based on dozens of university and government studies and U.S.
Census Bureau statistics. But state and local governments usually
provide about two-thirds of the benefits _ such as health care,
schools and roads _ given to immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that the federal government is reaping a
windfall at the expense of state and local governments,'' said
Moore, an economist at the Cato Institute, a Washington-based think
tank that promotes free markets and limited government.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of all immigrants live in just six states:
Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas. In
addition, more than 20 percent of the population of many large
cities _ including Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and New
York _ is foreign born.
</P>
<P>
   Moore cited a study by the National Research Council that
concluded that each new immigrant costs these state and local
governments about $25,000 over a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been true for a long time that the federal government
should look at some form of economic aid for states and cities that
have large immigrant populations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said that over the course of their lifetimes, immigrants
pay about $80,000 more in taxes than they use in services.
</P>
<P>
   He said immigrants generally cost the government money when they
initially arrive in the country but that after 10 to 15 years in
the United States, they begin to contribute more in taxes than they
receive in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, they need a little time to get into the economy
and to begin moving up the pay scales,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the most important predictors of immigrants'
success in the United States were their education level and ability
to speak English.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 21 million legal immigrants in the United
States, with an estimated 4 million to 6 million illegal immigrants
living in the country. The report's definition of immigrant
included both legal and illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But the report's conclusion that immigrants pay more in taxes
than receive in benefits came under fire from one Washington-based
lobbying organization that favors limits on immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for Immigration
Reform, called the report ``junk science.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a piece of propaganda ... to distort the findings of
recent studies that show that we must rethink our immigration
policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stein cited a recent federal study that found that immigrants as
a whole cost American households an average of between $150 and
$250 per year in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government should lower the annual number of
immigrants allowed into the country and give preference to people
with higher education levels.
</P>
<P>
   But Frank Sharry, executive director of the NIF, said the report
proved that immigrants are not a drain on government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is this: We may not like the fact that we are
a nation of taxpayers, but should be grateful that our load is
lightened by the fact that we are a nation of immigrants'' Sharry
said.
</P>
<P>
   The NIF promotes legal immigration and has lobbied against
congressional efforts to curb the ability of immigrants to bring
family members to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 immigrants are admitted into the United States
each year.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moore also said immigrants would play a key role in keeping the
nation's Social Security system solvent as 40 million baby boomers
begin to hit retirement age in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Because immigrants tend to arrive in the United States in their
20s and 30s, they will provide a needed boost to the dwindling
number of younger, native-born workers supporting Social Security
beneficiaries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, each Social Security beneficiary was supported by 16
workers. By 1993, the number of workers per beneficiary had dropped
to about three. The government predicts that number will fall to
1.8 by 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cut off immigration today, the Social Security system
could not operate as is for very much longer,'' Moore said.

 &HT;    COLUMN:If you must diet, try to schedule it in melon season
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are a couple of evil unacceptable aspects to having an
illness _ of any kind, I suppose. I won't go into the worst one
_the hospital bedpan that no human being ought to experience. But
now the diet ...
</P>
<P>
   I have been on diets in my life, and it is my considered opinion
that food of all kinds is so good a free-thinking American citizen
should have an inalienable right to eat anything.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a new bride, I read somewhere that a three-day liquid
diet would do wonders for the body and the mind. My husband and I
stocked up on juices and embarked on the diet. At that time, we
lived in a tidy garage apartment on Pensacola Bay. It was tidy
because we had a three-days-a-week maid who kept an immaculate
house.
</P>
<P>
   But one day, we came home to find the apartment in a shambles
and a note stuck to the refrigerator: ``I have went home. I am
sick. I think it is the hungry headache.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been many times since that diet when I have felt
afflicted by the hungry headache. When they leave the salt, the
sugar and the fat out of your food, you may decide to forgo food
altogether. The only thing that saves you is fruit, and watermelon
season was the greatest bonanza to hit my recent illness.
</P>
<P>
   Alford, the little northwest Florida town where my mother lived
the last 38 years of her life and where my son now lives, was a few
years ago a great watermelon shipping center. Our friend Miss Pearl
Scott was the depot agent _ when they had a depot _ and normally
she could put on her sun hat, open her umbrella and walk two blocks
down the sun-baked street for lunch at home.
</P>
<P>
   Not in watermelon season. Trucks and wagons filled all the space
around the loading platform, awaiting the train that would take
sweet Jackson County melons to the underprivileged citizens of the
North. My mother knew some of the farmers and they were generous
with their melons. When my children visited, they could count on
watermelon being cut every afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Now with melons in our stores priced at close to $5, a daily
cutting seems outrageous. And a watermelon cooling in a tub of
water in the shade of the pecan tree seems as extravagant as an
emerald necklace.
</P>
<P>
   Still it was the season, and nothing else tasted like anything
much, and my son decided to go find us a watermelon.
</P>
<P>
   A friend who runs a produce stand came through. The melon was
more costly than in the old days, but Miss Ardella threw in
cantaloupes and tomatoes from her garden _ the greatest feast I had
enjoyed in days. The fatal blow to any diet is the cookbook. I have
many, some of them very beguiling, and when you lie in the porch
swing and sip iced tea, unsweetened, or lemonade, ditto, there's
always a cookbook handy to read, the kind with lemon meringue pie
and strawberry shortcake on the cover. I was done in by Frances
Shultz's lamb stew a few weeks ago, but fortunately a houseful of
company made short shrift of that. The other day, I turned down an
invitation from my daughter to eat barbecued pork ribs with the
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, thanks,'' I said valiantly. ``I'm having a tuna fish
sandwich. Low-fat mayonnaise.''
</P>
<P>
   They diagnosed my case as pure insanity. How can you be sane and
not have fat, sugar and salt?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a benign grocer marked his watermelons down as a
patriotic Fourth of July gesture, and I now have those two
important American artifacts, a flag flying over the front door and
a watermelon cooling on the back porch.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Meal behind the scenes quite a find
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 9: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, I've played this scene and played it again: On the
way out of a restaurant after a long lunch _ when employees have
gathered in the dining room to have their own meal _ I glance at
their plates, note their enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that you're having?'' I ask. Never has the answer been
something on the menu; usually, it's a generic dish.
</P>
<P>
   I go away, having enjoyed a fine meal of my own, one that went
on until the place was closing _ but I carry with me an insatiable
appetite for what I didn't have. Call it another quest for
something different, another pursuit of tasty pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   So it has gone in cities around the country, in eateries of all
kinds, from Japanese to French to Mexican to Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the other day, I finally did it. Joined staff members for
lunch at Hsu's Gourmet Chinese Restaurant in downtown Atlanta. The
occasion was as delightful as I had imagined all those times I'd
been an onlooker.
</P>
<P>
   The meal began at 2 o'clock, as about a dozen of us sat in
booths across from the bar. In my booth were owners Anna and
Raymond Hsu, and maitre d' George Hull. Chatting before we dined,
the Hsus were explaining that employee meals usually are based on
what the restaurant has a lot of on a given day.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond went on to say that the dishes (Hsu's serves lunch and
dinner) must be interesting _ and different from what the public is
served: ``We don't want to repeat the menus.'' Moreover, they must
be economical, as employees are not charged. All this requires ``a
creative chef,'' he noted. That would be Charlie Shan, Anna's
brother.
</P>
<P>
   He came through with fine style and taste. First, egg drop soup
and a side dish combining pickles, cilantro, peppers. Then, a
robust-looking creation: fried sea bass on the bottom and on top,
bok choy, onions, black mushrooms, deep-fried tofu and barbecued
pork. Not on the menu, it was a wonderful surprise of blended
flavors, mingled juices and textures. So good, we talked about
whether it should be named and put on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   The meals often are expanded when someone brings in a dish from
home. On this day, Ellen Shan, the chef's wife, brought in kimchi
(spiced, pickled Korean cabbage). It was my dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my best efforts, I could not finish off the sea bass at
our table. ``There's always plenty _ more than enough,'' said Hull,
the maitre d'. ``You never go away hungry.'' To be sure.
</P>
<P>
   And to think the whole thing is repeated at around 10 p.m., when
employee dinner is served. (No, I haven't done the late meal. Not
yet.)
</P>
<P>
   Why does a restaurant do this? (Others provide employee meals,
too, some free, some charging discount prices.) Why go to the
trouble of creating extra meals twice a day?
</P>
<P>
   Anna, refreshingly to the point, had the answer: ``We have to
eat.''
</P>
<P>
   And they do it well.

 &HT;    Love, peas &AMP; happiness
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 9: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An old lady sits outside in a lawn chair. It's midsummer, and
she is wearing a cotton house dress covered with thousands of faded
purple violets. Her hands zip back and forth through a big enamel
dish pan that is balanced on her lap. She is shelling peas.
</P>
<P>
   A baby picks up a sweet, buttery crowder pea, pops it into her
mouth, and her face grows round and happy. She smacks, gives a
little kick, reaches for another.
</P>
<P>
   Down through the ages, Southern field peas have been a comfort
to old and young alike, a ritual of summer as constant as corn,
okra and tomatoes. Though there are innumerable ways to cook a
field pea _ from soups and stews to pilaus and pea cakes _ any
Southerner will tell you that his way is the only way:
</P>
<P>
   Pick a mess with the dew still on them. Shell them carefully.
Wash them gently. And simmer them slowly with a hunk of ham or pat
of butter.
</P>
<P>
   On a parched summer day, with nothing more than a little chopped
onion, a slice of corn bread and a pitcher of sweet-lemony iced
tea, a lunch of field peas can be as refreshing as a dip in the
pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like my field peas to taste like field peas and not much
else. If they're good and fresh, who wants to mess 'em up?'' says
Savannah cookbook writer Damon Lee Fowler. Though he fancies them
in hoppin' Johns and ragouts, the only field pea recipe in his new
book _ ``Beans, Green and Sweet Georgia Peaches: The Southern Way
of Cooking Fruits and Vegetables'' (Broadway, $17.50) _ is for a
classic, pork-scented pot o' peas with snaps.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced via Africa and the slave trade, these legendary
legumes come in dozens of varieties, with lovely monikers that
connote their various attributes: black-eyeds and pink-eyeds, cow
peas and lady peas, purple hulls and zippers, butter beans and
butter peas. According to culinary historian Karen Hess, there's
even a whippoorwill pea and a corn-field pea.
</P>
<P>
   Field peas can be light or dark, plain or mottled, vivid as
jewels or murky as dishwater. But our kidney-shaped field pea
should never be confused with the more common English type, often
associated with vegetable ``medleys,'' TV dinners and the phrase
``pea green with envy.''
</P>
<P>
   Snap open a field pea, and you will notice a fragrance as
distinctive as that of freshly cut grass. Yet it is subtler _ clean
and slightly soapy smelling. As you open the pod, the peas will
fall out of their lacunae, sometimes swaddled in a gauzy veil of
white, like a newborn baby.
</P>
<P>
   It's not for nothing, you see, that ``sweet pea'' and ``butter
bean'' have become terms of endearment for our most precious loved
ones. Peas are primordial, seeds of life, symbols of regeneration.
And they are meant to be cooked and shared with love.
</P>
<P>
   In Mary Randolph's ``The Virginia House-wife'' of 1824, the
first Southern cookbook, she suggests boiling them, mashing them
into cakes, frying them and topping with bacon bits. Today, you
could plate those pea cakes with a salad of heirloom tomatoes, a
sprig of basil and a splash of vinaigrette, and you'd have an
appetizer that's at once timeless and contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   In Birmingham, chef Frank Stitt (Highlands Bar &AMP; Grill, Bottega)
does a succotash of peas, corn and okra, and tosses it with penne
pasta, chunks of fresh tomatoes and lots of olive oil. He also
makes pink-eyed pea and green-tomato risotto with summer herbs, and
pairs it with grilled tuna. You can also use field peas to make the
Italian classic risi e bisi (rice and peas) or puree them with
chicken stock and potatoes to make soup. For a hearty stew of
summer vegetables, you might combine peas or beans with tomatoes,
corn, okra, collards or whatever's fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, pea-shelling seems to be going the way of rocking on the
porch. ``It's getting to be a lost art,'' says Mike Coolick, a
produce buyer at Harry's Farmers Market in Alpharetta, Ga., noting
that most markets are now outfitted with mechanical shellers.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, I was at the market the other day, happily loading
a bag with cream-colored crowder peas, when I saw two ladies
scooping up shelled peas. ``Why don't you buy these?'' they barked.
``They're cheaper. And they are already shelled!'' Never mind that
they were smashed _ and that you couldn't tell what kind they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies,'' I thought, ``you don't know what you are missing.''
</P>
<P>
   In my mind's eye, I see my grandmother. She is wearing her
clunky lace-up support shoes and a dress covered with tiny purple
flowers. ``Oooh, it sure is sultry,'' she says, stopping to fan
herself, or swat a fly. We are sitting under an oak tree, shelling
peas.

 &HT;    Easy casserole aims to please many palates
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 9: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Versatility is a sign of a good recipe. So when Sonya Burnette
sent us an e-mail request for a broccoli casserole using sharp
cheddar cheese, we knew the one Barbara Montague sent us would fit
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple, one-dish casserole that's hearty enough to be a
main course for a meatless meal but also works well as a side dish.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from a recipe book made by the Campbell Soup Co., it's
not surprising that the binder in this dish is a creamy soup. But
you have the choice of creamed soups, depending on your personal
favorite. Cream of celery, chicken or mushroom all work well. And
you can top it with buttered bread crumbs or crumbled Ritz
crackers.
</P>
<P>
   And if broccoli doesn't please your taste buds, try this with
cauliflower.

 &HT;    Peas can be a side dish or a main course

 &HT;    By Wendell Brock

<P>
   The agrarian South has historically been a place where pigs and
peas are plentiful. We plant the field peas to replenish the soil
with nitrogen, then cook 'em up with a bit of pork fat or ham.
</P>
<P>
   But never say we are set in our ways.
</P>
<P>
   One of the recipes below is actually vegan (the penne with
peas). For that and the risotto, you season the peas by cooking
them in an aromatic broth. You may also build layers of flavor by
sauteing onion and garlic in olive oil, then adding the peas _ and
whatever else you like _ to simmer in water.
</P>
<P>
   As hot as it is outside right now, most of these dishes make a
good main course. Just don't forget the corn bread and the iced
tea.

   This is a doctored-up version of the classic Southern pot of
peas. If you want the genuine article, omit everything but the
pork, salt, water and peas. For a more refined and healthful broth,
cook the peas in a pork stock (boil a ham hock or other pork pieces
for 1-1 1/2 hours, strain and discard pork, skim fat). Serve with
corn bread and sliced tomatoes and you have a traditional country
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   4cups shelled purple-hull, black-eyed or crowder peas
</P>
<P>
   6ounces pickled pork, salt pork or smoked slab bacon (rind
removed), diced
</P>
<P>
   1large russet potato, peeled, cut into small dice
</P>
<P>
   1medium bell pepper, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon picante sauce, preferably Tabasco brand, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons minced parsley, preferably flat-leaf
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   7 cups water
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients in a heavy 4-quart saucepan. Bring to a
boil over medium-high heat; skim foam from surface. Reduce heat so
liquid barely simmers. Cover and cook until peas are tender and
potato has broken down to thicken the cooking liquid (about 45
minutes to an hour for fresh peas). Taste and adjust seasonings.
Serve hot. _ Adapted from Terry Thompson's ``Taste of the South''
(HPBooks).

   This is a singular recipe for corn bread, not just because it
was my grandmother's but because of the technique. By slow baking
at a low temperature, you achieve a crisp crust and a cakey
interior. The buttermilk gives the bread a very slight tartness. I
owe my Aunt Libby Allen and my cousin, Meredith Allen, 23, a big
thank-you for writing it down. It's an heirloom now. Leftovers may
be sliced in two, dotted with butter, put under the broiler and
served with a salad.
</P>
<P>
   2cups fine-grind cornmeal

<P>
   2tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 300 degrees. In a medium bowl, mix cornmeal,
salt, buttermilk and oil with a spoon until well-combined. With
your hands squeeze the dough to get all the lumps out; then shape
into 4 corn pones. Place pones on a very well-greased baking sheet
or cast-iron griddle. Pat top of each lightly with oil. Bake until
lightly browned, turning when bottom is brown and crusty (about 45
minutes); continue cooking for 30 minutes.

   At Birmingham's Highlands Bar &AMP; Grill, Chef Frank Stitt serves
this lovely risotto with grilled tuna. I can't imagine anything it
would not taste good with. When fresh peas are out of season, he
uses fresh-frozen ones, and recommends Mackenzie brand.
</P>
<P>
   4cups cold water
</P>
<P>
   1onion, quartered
</P>
<P>
   1celery stalk, broken in half

   2bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   Several sprigs fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   2cups fresh peas (pink-eyes, crowders, butter peas or little
baby butter beans), rinsed and picked over
</P>
<P>
   2cups reserved pea broth

</P>
<P>
   2green onions, finely sliced
</P>
<P>
   Several leaves basil, mint and cilantro, coarsely torn
</P>
<P>
   For the peas: In a medium saucepan, heat cold water, onion,
celery, garlic, bay leaves, thyme and salt. Simmer for 20 minutes.
Add peas, skim and cook until tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from
heat and allow peas to cool in their broth. Discard aromatics.
Strain and reserve broth.
</P>
<P>
   For the risotto: Combine the pea broth and chicken stock and
bring to a simmer (if there is not enough broth, add water to make
4 cups). In a medium saucepan, warm the olive oil and butter, add
onion and soften for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add garlic,
thyme, chili pepper and rice and cook over medium heat for 2
minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add 4 ounces
warm broth; stir vigorously until broth is absorbed. Repeat until
rice is tender but still firm, adding extra water if needed. Season
with salt and pepper. Toss peas into risotto and season with salt
and pepper and a little extra-virgin olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   To serve: Toss the green tomatoes with the green onions, herbs
and 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil and place on the risotto.

   Chef Frank Stitt told me he's serving this dish _ or something
like it _ at Bottega, his Mediterranean-inflected restaurant in
Birmingham. So I took his idea and ran with it. The results were
vibrant and delicious _ kinda Southern, kinda Italian. The key is
to toss in the ripest possible tomatoes at the last minute, with
plenty of olive oil. We used butter beans for our
photograph(DIRECTIONAL, IF YOU USE PHOTO), but you can use any
field pea.

   2large tomatoes, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons basil leaves, roughly torn with hands
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   For the peas: Place peas in medium pot along with carrot, onion,
celery, thyme and parsley. Add 1 teaspoon salt. Cover with water
and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until peas
are tender. The fresher the pea, the faster it cooks. Check
doneness in 15 to 20 minutes (butter beans may take 30 minutes).
Strain peas, saving 1/2 cup broth. Discard the aromatics. Set peas
aside.
</P>
<P>
   For the penne: In a large stockpot, bring 3 quarts of water to a
boil and stir in the remaining teaspoon salt. Add penne to the
salted boiling water. Stir occasionally to keep pasta from sticking
together. When the water returns to a boil, cook until al dente,
about 10 minutes. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   For the vegetables: Place a large saute pan over medium-high
flame and add 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil and the garlic. Saute 3
minutes. Add okra and corn to the garlic in the saute pan and cook
another 3-5 minutes. Add 1/2 cup pea broth and simmer 3-5 minutes
or until okra is just tender. Add peas and tomatoes to
corn-and-okra mixture, along with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive
oil. Raise the heat to medium and cook until tomatoes are heated
through, about 3-5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   To serve: In a large serving bowl, toss the pasta with the
vegetable mixture and the basil. Use more olive oil, if desired.
Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

salt, give it a stir and bring to a boil. When mixture starts to
boil, turn flame down to medium and allow to simmer gently until
the peas are almost, but not quite, tender (about 45 minutes, if
fresh). Don't cover, and be sure to dip all the scum out of the pot
as it cooks.
</P>
<P>
   Throw out the ham hock, add the collards and tomatoes and bring
to a high simmer. Reduce heat and let simmer for 15-20 minutes,
until the tomatoes have cooked down. Check for salt. Then top the
pot with the okra, cover with lid and allow to cook until the pods
are just tender, about 10 minutes. Ladle into bowls and serve at
once.

   This recipe is from Savannah author Damon Lee Fowler _ sort of.
His new book on Southern vegetables, ``Beans, Greens, and Sweet
Georgia Peaches'' (Broadway, $17.50), has a recipe for Peanut
Ragout with Tomatoes and Country Ham, which is an object lesson on
how goobers may be used in place of peas or beans, and vice versa.
But as I adapted it with extremely ripe tomatoes and tender peas
(which have a low cook time), I ended up with vegetable soup. So I
added well-soaked rice and got a perfect pilau. Serve with Frogmore
Stew, or any seafood or meat dish.
</P>
<P>
   1cup long-grain rice (such as basmati)
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons bacon drippings or extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2large cloves garlic, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   1medium yellow onion, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   2ounces julienned country ham or prosciutto
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon chopped fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   1to 2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   1whole pod hot red pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 cups shelled and washed crowder peas or other field peas
</P>
<P>
   2pounds ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped (you may blanch, peel and
seed if you like) or one 28-ounce can Italian plum tomatoes, seeded
and chopped, with juice
</P>
<P>
   2cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Rinse rice in several changes of cool water; place in small
bowl. Cover with hot (not boiling) water, cover and let sit for
15-20 minutes. Drain in colander for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While rice soaks, put bacon drippings or olive oil in a large
nonstick lidded pot or saucepan and place over medium-high heat.
Add garlic and onion and saute until garlic and onion begin to
soften, about 3 minutes. Add ham and saute, tossing frequently,
about 5 minutes. Add thyme, parsley, bay leaves and pepper pod.
Toss, cooking another minute or so. Add peas, tomatoes and broth.
Raise heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to
medium-low. Cover pot loosely and simmer slowly until peas are just
tender, about 30 minutes, depending on freshness. Check for salt.
</P>
<P>
   Add drained rice; stir well. Raise flame to high and bring to a
boil again. When mixture begins to boil, turn heat to lowest
possible setting, cover and cook for 20 minutes, without stirring.
Remove from heat; let pot sit for about 10 minutes. Fluff with fork
and serve.

 &HT;    Pea pointers: A guide to shelling, cooking, and storing
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 9: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- Measuring unshelled peas: A good rule of thumb: It takes
about 4 pounds unshelled peas to make 4 cups shelled. Pack one of
those plastic bags at the farmers market with unshelled peas, and
you will have approximately 4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   -- Shelling time: An adult should be able to shell 4 cups in
about an hour. But let the kids help. They tend to last for a good
1/2 cup or so.
</P>
<P>
   -- Freshness and cooking time: The fresher (and lighter-colored)
the pea, the less time it takes to soften. For instance, cream peas
(which are lighter in color and texture) might take 20-30 minutes.
Darker peas (such as purple hulls, black-eyes and pink-eyes) might
take 30-45 minutes or more. Butter beans are thicker and firmer and
need more time than peas.
</P>
<P>
   So taste. And let your palate decide.
</P>
<P>
   -- To freeze: For butter beans or limas, wash, shell and sort
according to size. Water-blanch small beans 2 minutes, medium beans
3 minutes and large beans 4 minutes. To water blanch, cover beans
in water, allow to come to a simmer, then begin counting the time.
Cool promptly, drain and package, leaving 1/2 inch head space. Seal
and freeze.
</P>
<P>
   For field peas, wash, shell and discard old or immature seed and
those with bug spots. Wash and water blanch for 2 minutes. Cool,
package and freeze as above.
</P>
<P>
   A palette of purples and greens
</P>
<P>
   What's the difference in a field pea, a butter bean and a green
bean? Field peas come in long, slender pods, 10-12 inches long. The
color of the shell indicates the treasures within. Butter-bean pods
are flat and crescent-shaped, 3-4 inches long, with just a handful
of beans inside.
</P>
<P>
   Green beans, haricots verts, snap beans, pole beans and runner
beans are another genre altogether, because you cook them in their
shells.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some common Southern field peas:
</P>
<P>
   -- Purple hulls have green shells with bright purple marks; the
peas are light green when raw; once cooked, they become a dusty
purple.
</P>
<P>
   -- Pink-eyes have even more vivid shells than purple hulls _
sometimes the entire pod is strikingly hued. The pea itself has a
deep-pink eye, very similar to a black-eye. But they are more
faintly colored, and more subtly flavored, than a black-eye.
</P>
<P>
   -- Black-eyes have verdant hulls with a tiny black mark at the
pointed end. Fresh ones remain green when cooked and taste kind of
like a boiled peanut.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cream peas (also called lady or white acre peas) seem to be
everyone's favorite. When cooked, they're tender, sweet and
buttery.
</P>
<P>
   -- Butter beans are essentially green lima beans. Occasionally,
you shell them to find that the beans are mottled with purple.
</P>
<P>
   -- Butter peas are a cross between a butter bean and a field pea
_ the seeds are squat and fat, the shells diminutive.
</P>
<P>
   -- Zipper peas (or white crowder) look kind of like the fashion
device: The peas seem to bulge from the pod, with thick, pronounced
sutures that are easily unzipped.

 &HT;    Lake Chatuge and environs overcome midsummer blahs with
recreation, crafts, and a heart tugging play
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hiawassee, Ga.--A small sign next to a Fieldstone Inn footpath
on the shores of Lake Chatuge bears the wisdom of naturalist John
Muir: ``Everyone needs beauty as well as bread, a place to play in
and pray in where nature may heal and give strength to body and
soul alike.''
</P>
<P>
   This is such a place _ and not just the Fieldstone, where
flower-covered lawns bright with red salvia, yellow day lilies,
fuchsia, white impatiens, crimson cannas and lavender hydrangeas
slope down to the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding green valleys, which hold such magic that folks
here call them ``enchanted,'' cradle the sparkling lake created
when the Tennessee Valley Authority flooded farmland in the late
'30s to bring electrical power to the area.
</P>
<P>
   The story is bittersweet. The formation of the Lake Chatuge
Reservoir displaced farms and families who had no choice but to
move to higher ground _ including Wiley and Bessie Cloer, parents
of Fieldstone Inn owner Bob Cloer. It heralded a new day for the
mountain people and the passing of an era. It was, as they say,
progress, but it took a toll on a way of life dear to the people
for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reach of Song,'' the state's official historic drama,
playing through Aug. 23 in nearby Young Harris, celebrates in song,
dance and stories a time when the rest of the world was somewhere
over the next mountain ridge. Among its cast members are those who
grew up in the area and recall how things used to be in the days
when women gossiped at quilting bees, men chewed the fat on the
whittler's bench and girls and their beaus courted at church
suppers.
</P>
<P>
   Only a 2 1/2-hour drive from Atlanta, the area around Lake
Chatuge _ Towns County and Hayesville, N.C., just across the state
line _ is near enough for a quick quickaway. And it's an easy area
to poke around: the loop from Hiawassee to Young Harris to
Hayesville and back isn't more than about 30 miles.
</P>
<P>
   We marveled at the changes since our last visit three summer
ago, especially in downtown Hiawassee, where new lodgings, shops
and restaurants signal growth in tourism, thanks partly to expanded
programming at the Georgia Mountain Fairgrounds. But mostly, we
reveled in the natural beauty of the land that has inspired poets
and pickers, artists and anglers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Lake Chatuge: Its lakeside location and fleet of rental boats
makes the Fieldstone Inn on U.S. 76 our lodging of choice in
Hiawassee. Of course, you don't have to go out on a boat to be
renewed by the power of water; just gazing out at the cool,
tranquil lake has a calming effect.
</P>
<P>
   Fieldstone makes it easy to drink in the lake vista, placing
benches and swings under the trees on the shore and erecting a dock
that stretches into the lake. (The sign at the dock says it all:
``It would be wonderful if every child could do some fishing and
every adult could do some sitting.'')
</P>
<P>
   A 20-foot pontoon boat, which carries up to eight, was bigger
than we needed for the three of us, but the 14-foot fishing boats,
canoes and wave runners carry only two passengers max. The big
clunkers ($65 for two hours, $80 four hours, $110 all day) are
great for floating parties and motoring around the
7,500-square-foot lake, up to the Chatuge Dam on the North Carolina
side, past campgrounds, no-frills cabins and multistoried lake
homes or east to the peninsula where the Georgia Mountains
Fairground and Anderson Music Hall nestle in the hardwoods. The
boat's canvas canopy provides welcome shade.
</P>
<P>
   The Fieldstone's large pool is a good place to cool off after a
day on the lake. There are also tennis courts, a health spa and
whirlpool. The restaurant overlooking the lake is open for
breakfast, lunch and dinner seven days, featuring both a buffet and
a la carte selections at each meal. We dined on a Saturday night,
when the prime rib buffet ($18.95) features a spread that includes
baby back ribs, eggplant parmesan, seafood fettuccine and lots of
vegetables and salad fixings. Sunday night, for a change of
scenery, we drove to the nearby Brasstown Valley Resort, where the
fresh mountain trout was the hit of the table.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Reach of Song'': Farmer by the broiling sun of day and
poet by the oil lamp's soft light at night, Byron Herbert Reece was
a son of Appalachia whose poetry captured the rhythm of the
mountains and ``the inspirational song of life'' that filled the
hollows. Reece's life and words provide the framework for ``The
Reach of Song,'' now in its 10th year. The title comes from one of
his poems: ``From chips and shards in idle times, I made these
stories, shaped these rhymes. May they engage some friendly tongue
when I am past the reach of song.''
</P>
<P>
   Performed at Young Harris College, where Reece once taught, the
play is a patchwork of traditional music and dance stitched
together with oral histories from old-timers in the community,
compiled by playwright Tom DeTitta. Reece walks about the stage
like a ghost, unseen by other characters, making keen observations
about the people and land he knows and loves. Occasionally, he
interacts with the others, becoming a part of the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reach'' helps visitors understand the attachment long-time
residents as well as newcomers have for this beautiful country.
Slides _ vintage photographs as well as scenics _ projected larger
than life on three screens provide not only a backdrop for the
lively action but a context for the stories.
</P>
<P>
   Songs sung a cappella or with acoustic accompaniment range from
the lilting ``Tennessee Waltz'' to the soaring ``Amazing Grace,''
from the haunting ``What Wondrous Love Is This?'' to the rousing
``Have a Little Talk With Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   While celebrating the simple joys of rural life and the
hardships that brought communities together, ``Reach'' has a darker
side: the changes wrought by the coming of electricity to the
valley and the advent of World War II as well as Reece's descent
into a personal hell that ended with his suicide in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the play's appeal is that many of the actors are just
regular folks with roots firmly planted in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live on the same farm my great-grandparents settled in the
1880s,'' says Hazel Farmer, 77, a six-year cast veteran who plays
the character Maybelle and also shares personal stories, including
her courtship with her late husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in it is just the way it used to be,'' says Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   David Hyatt, 59, of Brasstown, N.C., back in the role of Zack
Haskins after a two-year absence, says the play brings back lots of
memories. ``You don't walk away from it too easy,'' he says. Hyatt
knows about putting down roots: His father, who died at age 105,
lived in the same house for 102 years.
</P>
<P>
   -- Visiting art studios: Armed with a copy of ``The Craft
Heritage Trails of Western North Carolina'' (Handmade in America,
$11.95), we hit the back roads to find two Hayesville artists
featured in the book.
</P>
<P>
   We follow the directions to David Goldhagen's glassblowing
studio to the letter: from the light at U.S. 64 in Hayesville, we
drive a mile toward Franklin, then turn right at the sign for
Hinton Rural Life Center and wind through the valley for two miles
until we spy the blue mailbox on the right.
</P>
<P>
   We're here. He's not. An assistant lets us tour the huge studio
overlooking Lake Chatuge where Goldhagen (who, it turns out, is in
California for a show) creates abstract glass pieces in swirls of
color. His menorahs are especially distinctive, and much in demand.
His studio is usually open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. weekdays, but next time
we'll call ahead to make sure he's there: 828-389-8847.
</P>
<P>
   Robert St. Pierre was at home _ in fact, he was mowing a field
when we pulled up at his studio near Hayesville. St. Pierre is
happy to show us how he creates his wood vessels without benefit of
a lathe. He employs only saws and sanders to turn rough planks into
works of art, and nothing is stained.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just how they come out of the tree,'' he says. ``I
haven't found a board yet that wasn't beautiful in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly he uses indigenous woods _ walnut, maple, poplar _ from
dead, storm-damaged or diseased trees. Distinctive markings result
from rotting, minerals or fungus.
</P>
<P>
   Pencil containers start at $16, cremation urns go for $200 and
up and a 4-foot-tall decorative urn of Honduras mahogany is $3,000.
``I'd say there are 50 items in here under $50,'' he is quick to
point out.
</P>
<P>
   When he moved to Hayesville five years ago from Massachusetts,
he doubted anyone would come out to his studio/shop in Compass
Meadows nearly 10 miles outside town. Most days, 15 or more visit.
(Go north on N.C. 69, go through the light at U.S. 64, take a left
on Main Street, then left when the road dead-ends into Tusquittee
Street and watch for the signs; it's on the left. Open 9 a.m.-5
p.m. daily; 828-389-6639.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very inspirational and magical here,'' he says of his
adopted home.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even, as they say, enchanted.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   -- Getting there: From Atlanta, take I-85 north to I-985 north
to U.S. 365, then left on Ga. 384. This road will take you to Ga.
75; turn right and drive through Helen and continue on Ga. 17 to
U.S. 76, then left (west) to Hiawassee. Another option is taking
U.S. 129 off I-985 at Gainesville and traveling through Cleveland
to reach Helen and pick up Ga. 17.

WONDER BABIES REQUIRE ADVISERS, OF COURSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I may borrow a phrase from Rosie O'Donnell, my godson is a
real ``cutey patootey''!
</P>
<P>
   I knew he was going to be a bright, handsome lad because his
mother, Denise, suffered so during her pregnancy. She had
heartburn, hypertension, hemorrhoids, hangnails and really limp
hair that wouldn't hold a curl, but we told her she looked cute
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There is definitely a connection between difficult pregnancies
and astonishingly handsome, genius-like babies. Well, you know, I
was practically on life support during both my pregnancies. I
really was afraid that the government was going to come and take
both my boys off to a research facility the moment they were born.
It was so obvious to me from the second they entered the world that
they were clearly a cut above those illiterate babies lying in the
hospital nursery with them. Luckily, both of my sons refrained from
speaking until the appropriate time developmentally, or who knows
what might have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, my godson, Theron, (I know, we tried to talk them out of
that name, but it's a family tradition) well, he's just a little
milk-chocolate cherub. He's got a headful of curly black hair and
these fat cheeks that have ``kiss me'' written all over them. Even
his little crystal-clear drool is precious _ from afar and when I'm
not wearing silk.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Theron was born, I hosted a baby shower for his
mother. The other women brought very expensive toys wrapped in very
expensive paper: Fisher Price, Tonka, Little Tykes, Tyco, Carter,
Tommy Hilfiger.
</P>
<P>
   I am a very practical person so I bought Little T a very
practical present. I presented his mother with a large pot and a
wooden spoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this for?'' she asked incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for the baby,'' I replied with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll be cooking anything for the baby for quite
some time,'' she said, ``but I appreciate the thought.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dear friend, I promise you this will be your child's
favorite toy. He will bypass all of these other colorful,
academically correct toys to get to Auntie Moe's pot and spoon,'' I
said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, we formed a Circle of Wisdom and took turns dispensing
advice to the mother-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you breast-feed,'' advised a mother of four.
``Breast-feeding makes the kids healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids are healthy and I never breast-fed,'' countered
Denise's sister.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing debate over formula versus mother's milk almost
turned into a brawl. When Denise's sister started taking off her
earrings and pumps, I knew I had to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait! Wait!'' I pleaded. ``I have cheesecake, chocolate
cheesecake. Does anyone want cheesecake? It's fat-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that got their attention. Why argue when you can have
cheesecake instead? So it wasn't really fat-free cheesecake. What
do you want from me? I had a crisis on my hands.
</P>
<P>
   But we survived the shower and Denise survived labor and
delivery. She called me this week. I could barely hear her over the
pounding in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Bam! Bam! Bam!
</P>
<P>
   ``Your godson loves the toy you gave him just a little too much.
He's been banging on that pot for two hours,'' she said. ``You
should include a bottle of aspirin with that little present in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on my way,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you bringing another pot?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, something even better,'' I said. ``Wrapping paper. Kids
love gift wrap and it's quieter.''

PIERRE MATISSE'S ARCHIVES ARE A BONANZA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CAROL VOGEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During his 60 years as a dealer, Pierre Matisse
exhibited some of the greatest artists of this century in his
gallery in the Fuller Building at 41 East 57th St., including
modern masters like Miro, Balthus, Chagall, Dubuffet, Tanguy,
Mondrian, Giacometti, de Chirico and his own father, Henri Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre, a pack rat who was intensely devoted to promoting his
artists, hardly ever parted with a scrap of paper, and by the time
of his death in 1989, he had amassed files stuffed with
correspondence from all the artists with whom he had worked (many
letters were accompanied by original drawings), letters from his
father, exhibition catalogs, gallery records and letters from
museums and collectors, as well as photographs and prints.
</P>
<P>
   These archives, which document nine decades of 20th-century art
in New York, have been given by the Pierre Matisse Foundation to
the Pierpont Morgan Library. They will be available for study in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary treasure trove,'' said Charles Pierce
Jr., the director of the Morgan, which was founded as a public
institution in 1924. ``In terms of developing our 20th-century
holdings, this is about as good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Morgan usually moves in a slow way,'' continued Pierce,
who in his 11 years as director has tried to take an institution
with a reputation for being closed and stuffy and make it more
accessible to the public. ``But with this collection we have
Rollerbladed into the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the second bonanza for the Morgan in less than six months.
In February it received the Carter Burden collection of American
literature, more than 30,000 volumes plus rare manuscripts, letters
and other papers, from the Burden family.
</P>
<P>
   Both an art museum and a study center, the Morgan has a
collection of artists' letters dating from the 15th to the 20th
century, all housed in McKim, Mead &AMP; White's version of an Italian
Renaissance villa at 29 East 36th St. Its strength has been its
holdings of Italian Renaissance artists and many unusual documents,
like a series of 30 letters written by Manet during the 1870-1871
siege of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   With this new gift, the Morgan will not only document the
recognition of some of the greatest artists of this century but
will also give scholars a peek at a very private man who opened
American eyes to their work.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer's passionate belief in his artists was a lonely
undertaking. ``In the beginning my father spent a lot of time in
the gallery alone,'' his son Paul said. ``Year after year during
the 1930s he just sat there believing in the value of these artists
when few other people did. There would be hours and hours before
anyone would come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember once, when he had a Miro show up, all of a sudden
this crowd of people came into the gallery and he said he thought,
`Finally his work has been recognized.' You see, the reaction to
Miro had often been `My kid could do this.' But it was all a big
misunderstanding. The group of people were out for St. Patrick's
Day and had thought they recognized something in Miro's name.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents housed in 209 acid-free boxes are about
2,000 letters from artists like Balthus, Chagall, Dubuffet,
Giacometti, Miro and Tanguy, many of them actually series of
letters. Some are fancifully illustrated; others are accompanied by
watercolors or drawings that were discovered only when the
foundation's archivists were going through the material.
</P>
<P>
   For one of the most talked-about shows, ``Artists in Exile,'' a
1942 exhibition where for the first and last time, Mondrian, Leger,
Ernst, Chagall, Matta, Andre Masson and other European exiles
showed in the same space, a photograph of all the artists was taken
in Matisse's living room. There are also scrapbooks of all the
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   He often asked well-known writers to contribute to his show's
catalogs. Sartre wrote an introduction to a Giacometti exhibition
in 1948, the original of which is in the archives along with
corrections in Giacometti's own hand. Hemingway also contributed to
some of the catalogs. In 1933 he wrote a preface to a Miro
exhibition and the following year an essay for a show of works by
the Spanish artist Luis Quintanilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pierre Matisse took special care with all his catalogs,'' said
Robert Parks, the curator of literary and historical manuscripts at
the Morgan. The collection includes the original gouache created by
Miro for the cover of a catalog accompanying a 1947 show of his
work, as well as the catalog and invitation to the opening.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Myriad Details of 300 Shows
</P>
<P>
   Matisse held more than 300 exhibitions at the gallery and kept
checklists of works in each show, catalogs, announcements,
installation photographs, reviews, detailed financial transactions
and correspondence with his artists and his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent clients represented include Ralph Colin, a Manhattan
lawyer who founded the Art Dealers Association of America; Wright
S. Ludington, a collector and founder of the Santa Barbara Museum
of Art in California; Florene Schoenborn, the department-store
heiress whose important collection of modern art was left to the
Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Modern Art two years ago;
Duncan Phillips of the Phillips Collection in Washington; Joseph R.
Pulitzer Jr., the publisher; Edward G. Robinson, the actor, and
James Thrall Soby, the Connecticut millionaire, collector and
curator whose family fortune came from the manufacture of pay
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Records of purchase prices and other confidential financial
information will not be accessible until 2005 to 2020. Parks said
the library will release these documents sequentially over time at
the foundation's request.
</P>
<P>
   Letters exchanged between Henri and Pierre Matisse have also
been restricted until 2008, at the request of the family.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Pierre Matisse and his father has
always been a subject of speculation. At the 50th anniversary of
the gallery, Pierre Matisse told John Russell of The New York
Times: ``My father didn't want me to be a dealer. If I'd been a bad
writer or a bad musician, he wouldn't have minded. But all artists
are wary of all dealers, and he just didn't want me to get mixed up
with the trade.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Matisse, who is also an artist, said the letters
actually show how close father and son were. ``They are very
personal letters that indicated a very strong family attachment,''
he said. ``His father would berate him for not writing enough. He
had a tremendous interest in Pierre and knowing what he was
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria-Gaetana Matisse, Pierre's widow, said she believed it was
perhaps a good thing that Henri Matisse was in France and his son
in New York. ``It made correspondence necessary,'' she said. ``The
letters will give a very different view about their relationship
than people think. That they were distant is not true. They were,
in fact, amazingly close.''
</P>
<P>
   After Pierre's death nearly a decade ago, his heirs _ his widow,
his daughter, Jacqueline Matisse Monnier, and his two sons, Paul
and Pierre-Noel _ set up the Pierre Matisse Foundation, whose sole
mission was to organize the records for eventual donation to an
appropriate library or museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked in the gallery,'' said Mrs. Matisse. ``So for us
these were just working papers.'' The gallery's inventory _ 2,300
works by artists like Miro, Chagall and Dubuffet _ was sold for
$143 million in 1990 to Sotheby's and the Acquavella Gallery. But
the heirs say they never intended to sell the archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were a private matter,'' she said. ``And anyway what
value would you put on these things? Their only value is the
signatures.'' (Officials at the Morgan say they couldn't begin to
estimate the worth of the archives, because there has been nothing
comparable.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt strongly that they should stay in New York since this
was where the gallery was,'' said Paul Matisse. ``In the end we
felt unanimously that the Morgan was the best home for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting the archives in good order took about six years with a
staff of five working full time. ``Pierre Matisse did everything
himself, which was not uncommon for dealers of his time,'' said
Olive Bragazzi, director of the foundation. ``He was absolutely
devoted to his artists and making them known.''
</P>
<P>
   `Happy Coincidence' in Gift's Timing
</P>
<P>
   Today there is hardly an American museum that has not acquired
something from Pierre Matisse. It is through his salesmanship that
the Museum of Modern Art acquired his father's famous ``Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the gift comes at a fortuitous moment in the
Morgan's history. Curators are hard at work on ``New York Collects:
Drawings and Watercolors, 1900-1950,'' an exhibition of about 130
works from private collections that is scheduled to open in May
1999. A selection of artists' letters and other materials from the
Pierre Matisse Gallery archives will be displayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a happy coincidence this material arrived in time for the
show,'' said Parks. ``Several artists whose work will be featured
had been exhibited at the Pierre Matisse Gallery, and some of the
correspondence with the dealer will be on view to help tell the
story of their art.'' &QL;

DILLARD'S AGAIN EXTENDS TENDER OFFER FOR SHARES OF MERCANTILE
STORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Dillard's Inc. said Monday that for the second time it
was extending its tender offer for shares of Mercantile Stores Co.
Inc. to allow an antitrust review of the deal to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   The offer of $80 a share was to have lapsed Monday, but the
extension now gives Mercantile shareholders until July 21 to tender
their shares. Analysts said that the extension was routine and that
there was no reason to be concerned that the acquisition was in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The extension gives the Federal Trade Commission more time to
review the purchase for antitrust implications. Dillard's said it
had been providing information to the federal agency and expected
to satisfactorily resolve any antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Stephen M. Long of Prudential Securities said the
Dillard's purchase of Mercantile was not viewed as having an
antitrust problem. Dillard's has short-circuited any potential
problem by agreeing to sell or swap up to 25 percent of the
Mercantile stores.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation increased Monday about which retailers would be
interested in obtaining Mercantile stores that Dillard's decides to
sell or trade. Dillard's on Monday stood by its policy of not
commenting on any Mercantile stores it might sell or swap until the
acquisition is completed.
</P>
<P>
   But Long said Proffitt's Inc. increasingly was seen as
interested in at least some of the stores.
</P>
<P>
   Proffitt's, which operates the Proffitt's, Younkers and Carson
Pirie Scott chains, said Monday that it planned to buy Saks Fifth
Avenue department stores for $2.82 billion in stock and assumed
debt. Analysts said that, even with the Saks purchase, Proffitt's
had resources to acquire more stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got plenty of money,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   The Saks deal will give Proffitt's stores in new markets. Long
said Proffitt's probably would be interested in adding stores in
those markets to spread distribution and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   Proffitt's attention has been focused on the Saks deal. Now it
can turn to the possibility of picking up some of the Mercantile
stores, Long said.
</P>
<P>
   A Proffitt's spokesman could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Other retailers thought to be interested in some of the
Mercantile stores are Federated Department Stores, which owns
Macy's and Bloomingdale's, and May Department Stores, which owns
Famous Barr and Lord &AMP; Taylor.

HARD RED WINTER WHEAT HARVEST IN KANSAS IS NEARLY COMPLETE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA SIZEMORE LONG  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) It's all but a wrap for this year's Kansas hard red
winter wheat harvest.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sunday, the harvest was 97 percent complete, compared with
68 percent last week. A year ago at this time, the harvest was 58
percent complete, and the average for this time of year is 59
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas is the leading producer of hard red winter wheat, which
is used to make bread and similar products such as hamburger buns.
Hard red winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas farmers are expected to harvest 393.9 million bushels of
wheat this year, based on June 1 conditions. The estimate is up
from the 377.4 million estimate of May 1. The next official
estimate will be Friday and will be based on conditions as of last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The harvest, which usually isn't completed until the middle of
the month, was helped this year by generally good weather.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Hand, an agricultural statistician with the Kansas
Department of Agriculture, said hot, dry weather in early June
allowed wheat to ripen faster than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a cool, wet spring helped wheat plants recover from
an early spring freeze but slowed ripening and delayed the start of
harvest, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide in the past week, there were 5.1 days suitable for
field work. Major field activities involved harvesting of wheat;
cultivating of corn; and planting of fall crops, such as sorghum.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, the leading U.S. producer of sorghum, harvested 273
million bushels last year. Currently, 97 percent of the state's
sorghum crop has emerged. Sorghum is used as a livestock feed.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas corn crop has been rated at 11 percent excellent and
57 percent good. Thirty-one percent of the crop has begun to silk,
ahead of last year's pace of 21 percent.

 &HT;    CNN controversy still a hot topic of discussion
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite extraordinary efforts at disclosure, a retraction and an
apology, CNN's Operation Tailwind debacle refuses to die.
</P>
<P>
   CNN staffers and outside critics continue to express concerns
about the role of two key players: CNN-US president Richard Kaplan,
who launched the ``NewsStand'' program where the report aired, and
correspondent Peter Arnett, the on-camera reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett was scheduled to fly back to Atlanta from his vacation in
Oregon Tuesday for a meeting with CNN chairman Tom Johnson Tuesday
night. Johnson is reviewing Arnett's role in the Tailwind report to
determine whether Arnett's reprimand, issued Thursday, is
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call Tuesday morning with about 150 CNN
employees, CNN chairman Tom Johnson expressed full confidence in
Kaplan, and said Kaplan would not be leaving.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
   -- Johnson told CNN staffers Tuesday he has named Richard Davis,
currently vice president of Washington public affairs programming,
as executive vice president of editorial standards and practices, a
new office set up to try to prevent a recurrence of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   -- Johnson also told CNN staffers that he had tendered his
resignation over Tailwind twice to CNN founder Ted Turner, but that
Turner had rejected it, confirming widespread rumors within CNN.
</P>
<P>
   -- Producer April Oliver, one of three CNN producers who lost
their jobs because of the Tailwind story, said Tuesday that she
initially asked for an hour for a more in-depth report on Tailwind
that would have included more of the other side, but was told it
would appear as a segment on ``NewsStand.'' The story aired in less
than 20 minutes on ``NewsStand's'' debut episode.
</P>
<P>
   -- Johnson and Kaplan have decided not to attend the Television
Critics Association meeting on Friday in Pasadena, Calif. Johnson
has not yet spoken with outside reporters about the Tailwind story
and its retraction.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7, a ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP;Time'' report alleged that in
1970, U.S. military forces dropped sarin nerve gas on U.S.
defectors and civilians in Laos. Almost immediately, participants
and critics charged CNN with journalistic malfeasance, and Johnson
eventually asked an outside attorney to investigate. On Thursday,
CNN retracted the story and apologized to viewers and military
personnel. A ``NewsStand'' follow-up Sunday aired CNN outtakes of
some of the Tailwind interviews, an extremely rare break with TV
news tradition of not showing outtakes.
</P>
<P>
   But CNN staffers still peppered Johnson with tough questions
during three in-house conference calls he held Monday and Tuesday
with hundreds of CNN employees. Johnson fielded questions _ so
pointed they might have been considered insubordinate under other
circumstances _ as to why Kaplan, who has a reputation as a
hands-on manager, had not resigned. Johnson strongly expressed
confidence in Kaplan and said he would not be leaving CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered resigning,'' Kaplan said Saturday on CNN's
``Reliable Sources.'' But he said he had been misled by the show's
producers and senior staff. ``I really didn't have an opportunity
to get to the truth of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's claiming that he's not in the loop, then he should
have been in the loop,'' Oliver, who lives in Washington, said
Tuesday. ``I wasn't in Atlanta when the piece was assembled, but my
editor told me Rick was beaming from ear to ear. No one suggested
the piece was tilted.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Perry M. Smith (Ret.), CNN's military adviser who
resigned in protest over the Tailwind report, said Tuesday that
Kaplan should go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most egregious piece of journalism in the history
of American television,'' Smith said Tuesday. ``CNN has gotten rid
of the lieutenants and majors, but the generals still haven't been
disciplined. Until that happens, CNN hasn't gotten to closure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't just happen on his watch,'' S. Robert Lichter,
director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, said of
Kaplan. ``This was his baby. That baby let out quite a howl,''
Lichter added. ``Kaplan is going to have to personally demonstrate
he belongs at the top of a major news organization.''
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson's comments Tuesday seemed to settle Kaplan's status,
Peter Arnett's position is increasingly unclear. A former Pulitzer
Prize-winner for reporting during the Vietnam War, Arnett was the
only Western correspondent in Iraq for much of the Persian Gulf
War. With Christiane Amanpour, he ranks at the very top of CNN's
corps of correspondents in status and prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Now some worry that Arnett's prestige might have shielded him
from more serious consequences in the Tailwind investigation,
allegations that Johnson is looking into.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the lead reporter, no question,'' Oliver said. ``I wrote
the script. But he (Arnett) would not have been a part of this if
he did not believe in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnett conducted three of the interviews, including one that
wasn't used initially, with a Tailwind pilot who said he dropped
tear gas, not nerve gas. (The interview was used in Sunday's
follow-up on ``NewsStand.'') Arnett's name and Oliver's shared a
joint byline as co-authors of Time magazine's report on Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett joined one of the CNN phone conferences Monday from his
vacation in Oregon and said he had contributed very little to the
reporting of the Tailwind report.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Kaplan called Arnett's reprimand ``within a hair
of actually being a dismissal.'' Kaplan also defended Arnett on
``Reliable Sources'', saying the reporter relied on Oliver's notes
and research.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Smith said Arentt's byline in Time is damaging no
matter what the truth is. ``If he didn't write the story, his
byline is dishonest,'' Smith said. ``If he did, he has to take
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military in general will not feel that CNN has completed
this action until Peter Arnett has left the scene,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported that Arnett, in his CNN conference
call Monday, said he was ``not going to let my reputation go down
the tubes'' over the report.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett was unavailable for comment Tuesday.

GO AHEAD AND SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) In these columns I am content to speak of small
things, leaving the more important matters to those who pretend to
know about them.
</P>
<P>
   Today's homily concerns (among other things) small
(ital)envelopes.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   I mean those envelopes that are enclosed in notices from
creditors or from the government, in which one is instructed to
return a payment or some completed form.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone go to all the trouble to order and send out
return envelopes that are a fraction too small to accept whatever
it is you're supposed to put in them?
</P>
<P>
   I have turned the possible explanations in mind, and the first
that occurred was that the folks who do it may be passionate
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   When you consider that the number of return envelopes in each
day's mail must run into the millions for the country as a whole,
even a slight reduction in size _ say a sixteenth of an inch top,
bottom and ends _ would mean the saving of a good many trees.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, it could amount to a whole forest. Maybe even half of
Canada or the Amazon Basin, or wherever it is we plan to get
pulpwood after we've ground up all our own trees to make computer
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it is one aspect of a giant research project whose
purpose is to determine the level of frustration a population like
ours can endure before lurching with a howl over the precipice of
lunacy.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that those childproof medicine bottles and
plastic-packs of lunch meat, which cannot be opened without tearing
shoulder ligaments and damaging the rotator cuff, are part of the
same scientific inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   I also have been struck by how strange it is, even as some
people are saving paper with their undersized envelopes, the way
others are recklessly wasting it.
</P>
<P>
   My bank, for example. Pass money through the window to the
teller and what you get back is a slip of paper called a deposit
receipt. Conveniently, these receipts may be saved in a pocket of
the checkbook. They are of a size to fit there exactly _ (ital)11
months of the year.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the Christmas season. And as a thoughtful little
gesture to its customers, the bank issues deposit receipts printed
with colorful bells and cheery greetings, and made just enough
larger that they will not fit in the checkbook's pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Every year it's the same. The teller takes my money. She gives
me the receipt. I (ital)know(end ital) it's the wrong size, but I
try anyway. And of course it won't go in.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of the season gives way to sudden, unreasonable fury.
</P>
<P>
   (ital)``Why do you do this?''(end ital) I hiss at the teller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beg pardon?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've made these too large again!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't really noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, look here! (ital)Do you see?(end ital)'' I show her how,
because of its size, the receipt tears when you try to slip it in
the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``A thing like that can't be accidental,'' I say. ``It has to be
(ital)deliberate!(end ital)''
</P>
<P>
   The teller is noticing the odd way my eyes shine, and how the
cords stand out on my neck.
</P>
<P>
   Her hand moves nervously toward the hidden alarm button under
her counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind,'' I tell her. And stumble out of there before the
armed security guard can be alerted.
</P>
<P>
   Inconsequential vexations, you may say these are. But I would
bet that on a day-to-day and year-to-year basis they affect more
people than politics, the fate of the yen, whale songs or the
expansion of the universe, over which such a huge deal is made in
print.
</P>
<P>
   Other writers are welcome to the big issues.
</P>
<P>
   My little corner of the paper here is concerned with quality of
life.

 &HT;    Pak gives South Koreans 'Hope, Encouragement'
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There aren't many occasions when an individual sports
achievement, especially from a golfer, has the potential to affect
a country's economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   When Arnold Palmer hitched up his pants in the '60s, it didn't
cause an explosion in the United States textile industry. Golfers
didn't rush out to buy treadmills when Jack Nicklaus trimmed down
in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Tiger Woods blew onto the professional scene two years
ago, not everyone felt the urge to go out and get a Nike tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   Se Ri Pak, 20, of South Korea, however, could be another story.
With the Asian economy having taken such a beating to Old Man Par
lately, her win in Sunday's U.S. Women's Open in Kohler, Wis.,
seemingly can do nothing but help.
</P>
<P>
   Headlines in South Korea on Tuesday after Pak's sudden-death
playoff win over amateur Jenny Chuasiriporn _ a Thai-American who
made it an All-Asian final _ proclaimed Pak ``Our Hope, Our
Encouragement.'' Lee Hong-koo, the South Korean ambassador to the
United States, was quoted as saying, ``She's the best news South
Korea has had this year.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably isn't an exaggeration. In December, South Korea had
to seek a $58 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Pak clearly boosted the country's national pride with the win,
not to mention the financial portfolio of her sponsor, Samsung.
When Pak won her first major, the McDonald's LPGA Championship in
May, the company estimated $150 million in advertising benefits
from the display of the Samsung logo and gave Pak a $290,000 bonus.
The company announced Tuesday that it will launch a new sportswear
brand named ``SERIPAK.'' While Asians and Asian-Americans probably
want to draw parallels between Woods and Pak, they are quite
different. Woods, who was raised in California by an American
father and Thai mother, is quick to smile and equally quick to slam
a club. Pak barely changes expressions, whether bunkered or
birdieing, and speaks in charming, although sometimes confusing,
English. Sometimes she uses feet to describe the length of a putt,
but means either yards or meters. Several times last week at
Blackwolf Run, indicating her calm approach to the most important
tournament in women's golf, she repeated, ``I have no nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing she has in common with Woods is an emphasis on the
major championships, and her record is a Tiger fantasy. Pak, who
took up the game only six years ago, has won both majors for which
she was eligible as a pro. Woods, who had a golf club in his hand
as a toddler, is 1-for-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Open notwithstanding, Pak does not think that she is the
world's best player. ``No, not yet,'' she said. ``I have many years
left. I am just starting. But I have good start.''

 &HT;    Golf Notes

<TEXT>
<P>
   More than just Disney World
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you haven't noticed, but Orlando quietly has become the
center of the golf world. Who calls it home? Who doesn't? Just
look: Arnold Palmer, Tiger Woods, Ernie Els, Lee Janzen, Se Ri Pak
and The Golf Channel. More PGA Tour and LPGA Tour players live
there than in any other city. There's also three-time Masters
champion Nick Faldo and 1998 champ Mark O'Meara; and two-time
Sarazen World Open champion Frank Nobilo. There's Payne Stewart,
Corey Pavin, Scott Hoch and Matt Kuchar, who is from nearby Lake
Mary, Fla. The appeal is both practical and financial. Obviously, a
major factor is warm, year-round weather for keeping a golf game in
shape. And not to be minimized are Orlando's assorted family
attractions. But, yes, money also is an issue. Florida is one of
two states without an income tax; the other is Texas. It's no
accident that Dallas also is a popular address for tour players.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredsson runs out of patience
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's Helen Alfredsson fired her caddie, Jason Hamilton,
after the fifth hole of her second round at the U.S. Women's Open
and handed her bag to fiance Leo Cuellar. Asked what happened,
Alfredsson just said, ``Oops!'' The next day, when the winds turned
Blackwolf Run into a horror show, her 2-over 73 tied for low round.
</P>
<P>
   Chip shots
</P>
<P>
   Playoffs were the rule this weekend. The Greater Hartford Open
and the Murphy's Irish Open both went to sudden-death. The U.S.
Women's Open used a Monday 18-hole playoff. ... Jack Nicklaus says
he thinks that the 18-hole playoff is the truest way to determine a
champion but in these days of television commitments, Monday
outings and travel connections it's probably no longer feasible.
... Casey Martin, who missed the cut at the Canon Greater Hartford
Open on Sunday, also is playing in this week's Quad Cities Open.
... It took 11 years for Larry Mize to get some repayment for his
140-foot chip-in to win the 1987 Masters. Maybe Olin Browne will
get a congratulatory telegram from the injured Greg Norman, a
victim that day at Augusta. Browne calls Mize's famous chip ``the
greatest shot I ever saw,'' but he made some history of his own
Sunday by holing out from 40 feet Sunday at Hartford to become the
sixth first-time winner on the PGA Tour this year. ``I've had a lot
of good breaks in my time,'' said Mize, who lost a four-stroke lead
with four holes to play. ... David Duval, another former Georgia
Tech player, regained the PGA Tour money lead Sunday, pushing his
earnings to $1,610,449. ... Australia's Ian Baker-Finch, whose
deteriorated golf game forced an early retirement, returns next
week to Royal Birkdale Golf Club, the site of his 1991 British Open
victory, without his golf clubs. He begins a two-year broadcasting
contract with ABC-TV.

 &HT;    CONFERENCE OFFERS STATES GUIDANCE FOR 'SMART GROWTH'
 &HT;    By SAMAR ABULHASSAN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Pointing to the success of curbing ``urban sprawl''
in his state, Maryland's governor urged the rest of the states
Tuesday to be smarter about how they grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 50 years, Americans have acted as if moving out meant
moving up,'' Gov. Parris Glendening told the opening session of a
two-day National Governors Association conference. ``We have paid
too little attention to agricultural communities when farms are
fragmented by development, or what happens to forests and the
wildlife that lives in them when they are chopped up by roads or
strip malls.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, ``we never wanted ``no growth'' or even ``slow
growth,'' Glendening said. ``What we were after was the unplanned
or poorly planned growth that was eating up our countryside at an
alarming rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at the conference outlined measures states should take
to channel growth and preserve green space.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland's plan, which reserves $16 billion in its annual budget
for ``smart growth'' initiatives, ``stresses guidelines and
incentives for growth instead of regulations,'' Moe said.
</P>
<P>
   Incentives in the Maryland program include financial assistance
to companies that clean up and redevelop properties contaminated by
others, grants to employees who buy homes in targeted ``smart
growth'' neighborhoods, and tax credits to companies who create 25
or more jobs in a ``smart growth'' area.
</P>
<P>
   To restrain sprawl, Maryland does not provide state funding to
help establish new communities in undeveloped areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local governments can still decide where they want development
can occur _ but if they opt for sprawl, they can't assume that the
state will help pay for it,'' Moe said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Moe outlined several overall strategies to combat
sprawl, including:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Creating comprehensive plans to address growth.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Creating an inventory of existing state development policies.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Develop policies to strengthen downtowns.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Encouraging local governments to plan for better land use and
protect their scenic and historic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, sprawl leads to a decline of the countryside's
character and contributes to the loss of a ``sense of community,''
Moe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we continue to allow our communities to deteriorate and our
countryside to be paved over, we stand to lose a major part of
America's memory of itself,'' he said.

VW AGREES TO COMPENSATE WARTIME SLAVE LABORERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In an abrupt reversal from a decision a
month ago, Volkswagen AG has agreed to set up a fund to compensate
workers who were forced into slave labor in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse announcement three weeks after the company had been
threatened with a lawsuit, Volkswagen said that its decision was
``in recognition of the historical and moral obligations'' to those
who were forced to work in its factories under the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen has acknowledged that it used slave labor. According
to a history financed by the company two years ago, it employed
15,000 slave laborers in the war.
</P>
<P>
   But Volkswagen executives had until Tuesday insisted that
compensating victims was a government responsibility, because the
company had been acting on government orders. When a group that
represents former workers from Hungary threatened last month to
sue, a Volkswagen spokesman said that any direct compensation by
the company was simply ``not possible'' under current law.
</P>
<P>
   Though reversing its position, the Volkswagen board declined to
say how much it would pay or whether it would make payments to
victims' families. The company said it would announce details in
September.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those who campaigned against the company declared victory
Tuesday. ``It is an unconditional surrender,'' said Klaus von
Muenchhausen, a lecturer at the University of Bremen who began to
campaign last month on behalf of 30 former factory workers.
</P>
<P>
   Von Muenchhausen, who threatened to sue Volkswagen if it did not
offer compensation by the end of July, said the company's decision
was quite likely to strengthen those who pursued similar complaints
against other German wartime companies.
</P>
<P>
   Von Muenchhausen said the workers he represented had been Jewish
teen-agers who were captured in Hungary and taken to Auschwitz.
From there they were sent by rail to Volkswagen factories in
Wolfsburg. Today the former workers all live in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen apparently came under pressure from the government of
Lower Saxony, whose governor is Gerhard Schroeder, the Social
Democratic candidate for German chancellor. The government of Lower
Saxony owns 20 percent of Volkswagen, and Schroeder is on the
supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Von Muenchhausen said state officials had pressed Volkswagen
because they did not want to be dragged into a unpopular court
battle, particularly in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen may have had its reasons for choosing to sidestep an
ugly controversy. The company has just completed the acquisition of
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the British manufacturer of luxury cars,
and it is acquiring Lambourghini, the Italian sports car company.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Volkswagen's new flash and success in the
marketplace, some local political leaders were unwilling to stick
out their necks to defend the wartime record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is paradoxical to buy the world's luxury brands and on the
other side be so miserly,'' the head of the Lower Saxony
parliament, Rolf Wernstedt, said several weeks ago. &QL;

BATTLE LINES ALREADY FORMING OVER QUARTER DESIGN FOR LONE STAR
STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Remember the Alamo! Or, maybe we should remember
the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders. The Texas longhorn? The armadillo?
</P>
<P>
   The final decision is at least five years away, but battle lines
are already forming over which Texas icon should represent the
state on special-edition quarters due for release in 2004. Under a
program approved by Congress last year, each state will have a
quarter designed in its honor beginning in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Five states will qualify for redesigned coins each year,
according to when they were admitted to the Union. Designs for the
first five states _ Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut
and Georgia _ will be heading to the engraver late this year.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington's portrait will remain on the front of the
coin, but the eagle on the back will be replaced by various state
symbols. The choice of a symbol is left to each state, and early
experience indicates that it is not an easy decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are already offended because we went with some designs
instead of others,'' said Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for New
Jersey Gov. Christine Whitman. In the end, New Jersey opted for the
famous image of Washington crossing the Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge was deluged with more than 5,300
suggestions before settling on a please-`em-all compromise that
includes ``Lady Commonwealth,'' an outline of the state, the
``Keystone State'' symbol and the state slogan, ``Virtue, Liberty,
Independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge jettisoned proposals to decorate the coins with images of
the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, the Hershey's kiss, celluloid
boxer Rocky Balboa, the groundhog known as Punxsutawney Phil and
the Great Dane, the state dog.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut opted for the Charter Oak, a Colonial-era tree that
fell more than 142 years ago. In 1687, early settlers hid the
state's charter in the tree to avoid its revocation by British
authorities. Among the rejected proposals were the hamburger and
the pizza, both of which were supposedly introduced to Americans by
New Haven restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Horgan, a columnist for the Hartford Courant newspaper,
chided state officials for shying away from more contemporary
images.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't want to decorate the coin with a golf ball or a
poker chip _ the state's principal diversions _ why not a
pothole?'' Horgan wrote. ``Like Montana has buffaloes, we have axle
busters that swallow up compact cars and jar loose teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which will submit its choice to the U.S. Mint in 2003,
also faces a long list of options. Nearly everyone, it seems, has
an opinion on the perfect state image.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas longhorn is the symbol of Texas. I don't know what
else you could put on it,'' said Don King, executive director of
the Texas Longhorn Breeders Association, based in Fort Worth.
``They were here before people were. It's the only symbol for
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the longhorn is also the mascot for the University of
Texas, so that image might not sit well with fans of archrival
Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't suppose they would consider the traditional thumbs-up
sign for Texas A&AMP;M,'' Aggie spokesman Jim Ashlock said. ``If we
have a longhorn on the coin, perhaps the horn should be sawed off.
You see a lot of those around A&AMP;M. We wouldn't object to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Dohmann of Alvin thinks he has an idea that the entire
state could rally behind: the state tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has more native pecan trees than any other state in the
country'' _ about 30 million, to be precise, Dohmann said. ``I
think it would be ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dohmann, who operates a commercial pecan orchard in Columbus, is
admittedly something of a pecan nut, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eat Pecans!'' his company's Web site urges. ``10,000,000
squirrels can't be wrong.'' Still, even Dohmann concedes that the
ubiquitous tree faces tough competition from another Texas plant,
the bluebonnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love bluebonnets,'' he said. ``I've got a huge patch of them
myself, but for advertising, it's kind of wimpy.''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like flora and fauna, how about a slice of Texas
history? The Alamo is sure to have plenty of defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pecans? Everybody is going to think Texas is full of a bunch
of nuts,'' said Jennifer Schulle of the Daughters of the Republic
of Texas, which oversees the San Antonio shrine. ``We don't need
that. The Alamo is definitely better.''
</P>
<P>
   In what may be a preview of the coming debate, junior high
school students in Karnes City are conducting an Internet poll on
Texas symbols for a class project. In addition to the usual
suspects, the students' list includes the Dallas Cowboys
cheerleaders, the cactus, the armadillo, the yellow rose, the
Indian paintbrush, the whitetail deer, the windmill, the oil
derrick, the mockingbird, the rattlesnake and the Texas Rangers
(the law enforcement agency, not the baseball team).
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a hard time narrowing it down,'' teacher Jan Johnson
said. Johnson said she tried to talk the seventh- and eighth-grade
students out of listing cheerleaders as a Texas symbol, without
success.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the balloting, she needn't have bothered. Out of
132 votes cast so far, the cheerleaders have captured five votes.
The winner to date: the horned toad, with 19 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a cheerleader isn't such a bad idea after all.

VISA SPEEDUP STALLED IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A plan to boost the number of skilled foreign
workers admitted to the United States has become stalled in
Congress, and a series of negotiating sessions between lawmakers
has so far had little success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is at an impasse, but we are still talking,'' said
one business lobbyist, who asked not to be named. Another said odds
of a bill passing this year are ``about 50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become contentious, with employers, particularly
high-tech firms like those around Boston, saying that the strong
economy has left a shortage of computer programmers and other
skilled workers. Employee groups and unions say that companies
merely want to replace Americans with low-cost foreign labor.
</P>
<P>
   Employers won a victory in May when the Senate voted to increase
the annual allotment of so-called H-1B visas, which allow a
foreigner to work at a skilled US job for up to six years. But now,
business groups are balking at the House version of the
legislation, already approved by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   That bill would boost the number of visas, but it would also
require employers to certify that they tried to recruit American
workers before hiring foreigners. Employers would also have to
certify to the Department of Labor that they did not lay off US
workers in the six months prior to hiring a foreigner on a H-1B
visa, or for three months afterward.
</P>
<P>
   House members say those requirements will prevent companies from
dislodging US workers to make way for foreigners. But business
groups say a company using H-1B labor might find itself in
violation of the law merely for closing down a product line,
subcontracting work to a partner or reorganizing in some other way,
which could leave it vulnerable to charges that it laid off US
workers while retaining foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This basically says the Department of Labor will determine who
you can hire, why you can hire them and when you can hire them, and
that the department will be looking over your shoulder every time
there is a business operations change,'' said Susan Marshall of the
Information Technology Association of America, a Washington trade
group.
</P>
<P>
   US companies reached the current quota of 65,000 visas in May,
five months before the end of the federal fiscal year. The Senate
and House bills would allow about 115,000 visas annually.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate and business groups opposed to the House bill, a
small group of lawmakers has held at least two lengthy meetings to
resolve the differences. The group included Republican Senators
Spencer Abraham of Michigan and Phil Gramm of Texas, and House
Republicans Lamar Smith of Texas, Henry Hyde of Illinois and Dick
Armey, the House Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is chairman of the House subcommittee that wrote the new
requirements for businesses using H-1B visas, and Hyde is chairman
of the House Judicary Committee, which approved them. Abraham
sponsored the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conflict is really within the Republican Party, between
the House and Senate,'' said Austin Fragomen, an immigration lawyer
who leads the American Council on International Personnel, which
represents about 350 multinational corporations. ``Smith has on his
side not only Republicans, but all the Democrats and the
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   When the talks between lawmakers made little progress, Smith
held several meetings with business groups to try to negotiate a
resolution, congressional sources said. More meetings are expected
once the House returns from recess next week.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has made some concessions during the talks, agreeing that
not all companies should have to certify that they tried to recruit
Americans before hiring H-1B labor. That rule would apply only to
companies that count H-1B workers as 15 percent or more of their
work force.
</P>
<P>
   But all companies would have to certify that they did not lay
off Americans before hiring H-1B workers, a requirement that
business groups so far oppose.

`CIDERHOUSE': ANOTHER MAJOR MARATHON AT THE TAPER (WITH DINNER
BREAK) 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When John Irving began work on ``The Cider House
Rules,'' his sprawling 1985 novel about eight decades in the life
of a rural Maine orphanage, he had no intention, he says, of
writing a wrenching polemic on abortion _ or, it seems safe to say,
a work that would be the basis for a two-part, six-hour play with
22 actors portraying 120 characters in 150 scenes.
</P>
<P>
   But 13 years after the book's publication and six years after a
trio of theater professionals conceived the notion of dramatizing
it, ``The Cider House Rules'' has become all that and more in a
production of the same name that opened here Tuesday at the Mark
Taper Forum and runs through Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The play blends the dramatic naturalism of Thornton Wilder with
the read-aloud fidelity of a Victorian literary circle, the
characters speaking not only their lines but their thoughts and the
author's wry commentary on them in a rapid-fire mix of declamation
and attribution. The effect is an unusual amalgam of conventional
drama and a staged reading.
</P>
<P>
   As adapted by playwright Peter Parnell and staged by a pair of
actor-directors, Tom Hulce and Jane Jones, the saga of ``Cider
House'' takes on more resonance than ever in a nation riven by
violence over abortion. The play tells the story of Dr. Wilbur
Larch, the kindly obstetrician of St. Cloud's Orphanage, who,
``when he was asked, and when it was safe,'' was an abortionist,
too.
</P>
<P>
   When Homer Wells, the young orphan who becomes Dr. Larch's
protege, eventually rebels at performing the procedure himself, he
opens a moral argument that mirrors every agonizing angle of the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tom first approached me with this idea, I'd always been
very sym0athetic to his talent,'' Irving recalled by telephone the
other day from his home in Vermont, referring to the co-director
whose acting career has embraced everything from the frat-house
high jinks of ``Animal House'' to the genius of Mozart in
``Amadeus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I must say, I thought he was nuts. It seemed to me to be a
singularly difficult thing to do at the length he was describing,
and yet I had so much confidence in his instincts in a world that
I'm very inexperienced in, that I said, `Sure, go ahead and show me
what you can get.'''
</P>
<P>
   What Hulce, Ms. Jones and Parnell have got _ together with a
company of mostly West Coast actors, about half of whom have
performed in earlier incarnations of the play over the last two
years _ is a vast social panorama that involves audience and
performers in a communal experience.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Royal Shakespeare Company's marathon ``Nicholas
Nickleby'' and Tony Kushner's two-part ``Angels in Amerca,''
``Cider House'' harks back to earlier eras of epic dramatic
storytelling, when ancient Greek or Elizabethan audiences made the
theater a daylong festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the multiple-marathon producers,'' said Gordon Davidson,
artistic director of the Taper, which originally produced both
``Angels'' and the two-part historical drama ``The Kentucky
Cycle.'' Over the last 30 years, Davidson has directed such
socially conscious plays as ``The Trial of the Catonsville Nine''
(with its debate over the Vietnam War) and ``Children of a Lesser
God'' (with its portrait of a deaf student and her teacher).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of it, certainly,'' Davidson said of the play's
extreme length, ``and I welcome it as part of the challenge of both
producing and of broadening people's horizons and challenging their
notions of what drama is and how to experience it.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences here can experience ``Cider House'' in two ways: in
two weeknight performances, or in a weekend marathon of a matinee
and evening performance, with a dinner break between.
</P>
<P>
   With its large cast, and complicated rehearsal and performance
schedules, the play is a major undertaking for the Taper. The
theater has a producing arrangement with the Jujamcyn organization
in New York, which helped finance a workshop of the play here this
spring and, Davidson said, there is interest in taking it to
Broadway when its run ends here.
</P>
<P>
   Irving acknowledged that the whole notion of the play was at
first off-putting to him, in part because he found the constant
shifts between dialogue and narration jarring in the script. But
when he showed it to his son, Colin, an actor who is now an
understudy for several roles in the Taper production, he was
reassured that the words would play much differently on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Cider House'' was first produced at the Seattle Repertory
Theater in 1996, Irving avoided seeing it because he was struggling
to condense the novel into a two-hour screenplay (which is to be
directed by Lasse Hallstrom for Miramax this fall) and did not want
to be confused.
</P>
<P>
   When Irving finally saw Part 2 in Seattle last year, he
recalled: ``I was just bowled over by it, I just loved it. The only
thing that made me feel bad about any of it was how sorry I felt
for myself and my screenplay. I was envious of all the things they
were able to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   This is music to the ears of Parnell, Hulce and Ms. Jones, who
first met at Playwrights Horizons in New York in 1982 when Hulce
and Ms. Jones were acting in Parnell's play ``The Rise and Rise of
Daniel Rocket.'' They kept in touch over the years, and when Hulce
was approached nearly a decade ago about playing Homer Wells in a
proposed film of ``Cider House'' that never got off the ground, he
was immediately drawn to ``the great scope of the story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he realized that the moments in it that most excited him
``were all theatrical, they were not cinematic, they were moments
that required the audience's use of imagination, moments that would
be more potent if they weren't literal.''
</P>
<P>
   So he approached Ms. Jones, who by this time had founded a
Seattle repertory company called Book-It that had produced verbatim
dramatizations of about 150 short stories, and who was looking for
a big, fat novel to expand her horizons.
</P>
<P>
   Parnell joined the team and, with Irving's halting consent, they
began a series of workshop productions aimed at preserving the
self-consciously Dickensian sweep of ``Cider House,'' in which Dr.
Larch reads ``David Copperfield'' and ``Jane Eyre'' aloud to the
orphans.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the workshops and readings from the Juilliard School to
the Breadloaf Writers Conference in Vermont to the Lincoln Center
Theater, they finally reached Seattle, where Davidson saw the play
and commissioned yet another workshop in Los Angeles this spring
before the current run.

</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of actors would come in to audition for this and say to
us, `How the hell are you going to do this?''' Ms. Jones said
recently between rehearsals, during an interview with the three
collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about activating the narrative to then use it. It's
so hard for the actors to do, but once they get it, it's no more
difficult than Shakespeare, really, in a way, because it's
language-driven. And you have to play a very strong objective
through the language, through the narration, so that it not only
transports you in time and place, but transforms you through
psychic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows you to creep into the mind of a character and
therefore retain and preserve the author's full intention of what's
going on, not only physically, but mentally with the character, as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The form seems to be powerful. Hulce said that when the play was
first in development in Seattle, there were several instances when
members of the audience fainted at graphic descriptions of
obstetrical and surgical procedures. ``And we weren't doing
anything except speaking the language,'' Hulce said.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, ``Cider House,'' staged on a spare, stylized set of
louvered panels and catwalks designed by John Arnone, is full of
stern stuff, from haunting descriptions of the effects of botched
abortions to Homer's horror as he contemplates what he takes to be
an aborted fetus' smile. And, as befits a work by the author of
``The World According to Garp,'' the play is also a universe in
which every act of carnal indulgence carries momentous and painful
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the story is the avuncular Dr. Larch (played by
Michael Winters, a Seattle-based veteran), whose youthful
experience with the tragedies of back-alley abortions convinces him
he should, in the words of the play, deliver not only babies but
mothers; and Homer Wells (played by Josh Hamilton, a young New York
actor), the orphan who becomes the doctor's beloved surrogate son
and sorcerer's apprentice. The moral and intellectual disagreement
between the emotionally scarred and celibate doctor and his
wistful, wide-eyed charge becomes the pivot for a three-generation
tale that also examines topics from 20th-century class tensions to
the socio-sexual implications of drive-in movies.
</P>
<P>
   For Parnell, who is used to telling his own stories as a
playwright (he is also the author of ``The Sorrows of Stephen'' and
``Flaubert's Latest,'' among others), the narrative form sometimes
posed particular challenges, as in the big set-piece abortion
debate between Homer and Larch near the end of Part 1. Would
injecting the author's narrative into what would otherwise stand as
a classic dueling dialogue ``let the audience down a little bit,''
or would it ``force the audience into the character's mind because
we're able to say what the inner voice of that character is
saying,'' he debated.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ms. Jones said, keeping most of the narration seemed
the way to stay closest to the world of John Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Parnell likened the intense collaborative process to the demands
of fine-tuning a musical comedy in out-of-town tryouts. ``We'll get
to a point and decide, no, this has to be done more quickly, or it
can be done partly in narrative and partly in dialogue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the creative team are quick to say that Part 2
posed the biggest dramaturgical problems. At that point in the
story, Homer leaves the orphanage to work on an apple farm, whose
workaday rules (often broken) give the play its title, and a raft
of new characters are introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we let Larch and Homer get too far away from each other,
then we don't have that heartbeat of the story anymore,'' Ms. Jones
said. ``And Homer becomes a wait-and-see type person in much of
Part 2, which is really hard to activate in some ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the novel, the play avoids easy answers to the moral issue
at its core, but still makes clear its sympathies are in favor of a
woman's privacy, and her right to choose whether she can perform
what Irving calls the ``act of service'' that is childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   The chance to grapple with that central thesis is a big part of
what has propelled Hulce to put his acting career on hold for the
last two years, and moved Ms. Jones and Parnell to devote so much
of their lives to what Parnell says has become a kind of home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being what I considered the `womb' here, the women's issues
have been highly motivating and challenging,'' Ms. Jones said.
``And how beautifully both characters can argue for the right to
choice continues to be moving to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with abortion under renewed attack around the nation,
and with nearly 60 percent of all physicians who perform abortions
now over 65 years of age and many younger doctors declining to
perform them, or even to learn how, Irving says he finds his story
``more topical now than when the book was published.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cider House'' remains his second-best-selling book worldwide,
after ``A Prayer for Owen Meany'' and far ahead of ``Garp,''
popular perceptions to the contrary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of places, when it was published, people said, `Oh, it's
kind of quaint, that issue's behind us,''' Irving said. ``The
crisis of abortion rights laid pretty low, and people were,
wrongly, I think, taking for granted a right that had barely been
in existence for 10 years. And especially younger people, who had
no experience in their sexually conscious lives of a time when it
wasn't available, were comfortable taking for granted that if they
needed it, it would be there. That right has to be protected again
and again.'' &QL;

GENERAL ASSEMBLY VOTES TO GIVE PALESTINIANS BIGGER U.N. ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The General Assembly voted overwhelmingly
Tuesday to give the Palestinians a larger role in the United
Nations and a voice in many of its peripheral activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, already members of several groups of
developing nations, hailed the vote as a first step toward full
United Nations membership.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's representative, Dore Gold, denounced the resolution's
references to the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and the West Bank
as a ``transparent effort'' to influence talks over the final
status of disputed territories. His comments reflect growing fears
in Israel that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is likely to
declare a Palestinian state next year, raising the possibility of
new bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   The vote _ 124-4, with 10 abstentions and 47 countries not
voting _ overcame the strong opposition of the United States. There
are no vetoes in the Assembly and the majority vote carries.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution in effect creates a new ``super-observer'' status
for the Palestinians _ or Palestine, as the delegation has been
known officially since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians will now have the right to take part in General
Assembly debate and reply to other speeches; to co-sponsor
resolutions on Middle East issues, and to take part in a range of
United Nations conferences and meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians will not have the right to vote in the General
Assembly, however. And nothing in Tuesday's actions affects the
work of the Security Council, which already allows the Palestinians
to speak in formal sessions when the interests of the Palestinian
people are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the U.S. representative, said before the vote
that the move is ``the wrong resolution at the wrong time.'' He
said it would set a precedent for other observers or non-members of
the organization.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If this resolution passes, it will undermine our efforts to
get the peace process back on track and hurt everyone's interests,
including those it most intended to help,'' Richardson said in a
speech. ``Exchanging momentum toward real progress on the ground
for symbolic progress in this chamber does not strike us as a good
bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department condemned the vote in strong
terms. The Department spokesman, James Rubin, said that the Clinton
administration considered the vote an unnecessary and untimely
mistake that could lead to unilateral actions on the part of the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that this decision undermines the chances of bringing
peace to the Middle East,'' Rubin said. ``It undermines those very
people who it was presumably designed to help. And it may be a
symbolic victory for some, but it makes it harder to prevent the
two sides from taking unilateral actions that can harm the peace
process. This is a unilateral action that we believe was
unnecessary and untimely.''
</P>
<P>
   After making some progress earlier in this decade in reducing
the isolation of Israel at the United Nations, the United States
has been increasingly sidelined more recently on Middle East
issues, which it tries to keep out of the United Nations as much as
possible. Tuesday only Israel, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia
voted with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union countries, Canada, and Russia were among
those voting for the resolution, which was first introduced in
December, then deferred for further study.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst Sucharipa, the representative of Austria, which holds the
presidency of the European Union, said that the Europeans had
concluded that the resolution would not set new legal precedents
for the organization. Europe supported the move, he said, in
recognition of the ``practical difficulties'' the Palestinians were
having in their work as observers at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, having finally won this round, intend to press
for full General Assembly membership, their delegation leader,
Nasser al-Kidwa, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small victory was achieved for Palestine today and we thank
you for that,'' he said in a speech after the vote. ``However, we
do want to say that it is our hope that our reliance on this
resolution passed today will not last for a long time, as we hope
that the United Nations will accept Palestine as a member state in
the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Kidwa said he hoped to see Palestine accepted as a full
member in the next General Assembly session, beginning in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shall be the big victory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's resolution was sponsored by a group of Arab nations,
joined by Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cuba, Malaysia, Vietnam, and
several African countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the American Jewish Committee, spokesman Arthur Berger said
the effort by the Arab and Third World nations was a step back for
the United Nations. ``Unfortunately this reminds a lot of people of
the way the United Nations General Assembly used to be when an
absolute majority of members would vote for anything that was
anti-Israel,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, what this does is try to influence the final status
of negotiations while the Palestinians and the Israelis are at a
critical moment. That's not helpful. In fact, it can be quite
unhelpful.''
</P>
<P>
   David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish
Committee, said: ``The U.N. member states might one day regret this
decision because it could establish a precedent that could return
in the form of other disgruntled political movements bypassing the
negotiating framework and establishing facts through U.N.
maneuvering.''

`CIDERHOUSE': ANOTHER MAJOR MARATHON AT THE TAPER (WITH DINNER
BREAK) 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 12.) 
(nk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When John Irving began work on ``The Cider House
Rules,'' his sprawling 1985 novel about eight decades in the life
of a rural Maine orphanage, he had no intention, he says, of
writing a wrenching polemic on abortion _ or, it seems safe to say,
a work that would be the basis for a two-part, six-hour play with
22 actors portraying 120 characters in 150 scenes.
</P>
<P>
   But 13 years after the book's publication and six years after a
trio of theater professionals conceived the notion of dramatizing
it, ``The Cider House Rules'' has become all that and more in a
production of the same name that opened here Tuesday at the Mark
Taper Forum and runs through Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The play blends the dramatic naturalism of Thornton Wilder with
the read-aloud fidelity of a Victorian literary circle, the
characters speaking not only their lines but their thoughts and the
author's wry commentary on them in a rapid-fire mix of declamation
and attribution. The effect is an unusual amalgam of conventional
drama and a staged reading.
</P>
<P>
   As adapted by playwright Peter Parnell and staged by a pair of
actor-directors, Tom Hulce and Jane Jones, the saga of ``Cider
House'' takes on more resonance than ever in a nation riven by
violence over abortion. The play tells the story of Dr. Wilbur
Larch, the kindly obstetrician of St. Cloud's Orphanage, who,
``when he was asked, and when it was safe,'' was an abortionist,
too.
</P>
<P>
   When Homer Wells, the young orphan who becomes Dr. Larch's
protege, eventually rebels at performing the procedure himself, he
opens a moral argument that mirrors every agonizing angle of the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tom first approached me with this idea, I'd always been
very sympathetic to his talent,'' Irving recalled by telephone the
other day from his home in Vermont, referring to the co-director
whose acting career has embraced everything from the frat-house
high jinks of ``Animal House'' to the genius of Mozart in
``Amadeus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I must say, I thought he was nuts. It seemed to me to be a
singularly difficult thing to do at the length he was describing,
and yet I had so much confidence in his instincts in a world that
I'm very inexperienced in, that I said, `Sure, go ahead and show me
what you can get.'''
</P>
<P>
   What Hulce, Ms. Jones and Parnell have got _ together with a
company of mostly West Coast actors, about half of whom have
performed in earlier incarnations of the play over the last two
years _ is a vast social panorama that involves audience and
performers in a communal experience.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Royal Shakespeare Company's marathon ``Nicholas
Nickleby'' and Tony Kushner's two-part ``Angels in America,''
``Cider House'' harks back to earlier eras of epic dramatic
storytelling, when ancient Greek or Elizabethan audiences made the
theater a daylong festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the multiple-marathon producers,'' said Gordon Davidson,
artistic director of the Taper, which originally produced both
``Angels'' and the two-part historical drama ``The Kentucky
Cycle.'' Over the last 30 years, Davidson has directed such
socially conscious plays as ``The Trial of the Catonsville Nine''
(with its debate over the Vietnam War) and ``Children of a Lesser
God'' (with its portrait of a deaf student and her teacher).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of it, certainly,'' Davidson said of the play's
extreme length, ``and I welcome it as part of the challenge of both
producing and of broadening people's horizons and challenging their
notions of what drama is and how to experience it.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences here can experience ``Cider House'' in two ways: in
two weeknight performances, or in a weekend marathon of a matinee
and evening performance, with a dinner break between.
</P>
<P>
   With its large cast, and complicated rehearsal and performance
schedules, the play is a major undertaking for the Taper. The
theater has a producinc arrangement with the Jujamcyn organization
in New York, which helped finance a workshop of the play here this
spring and, Davidson said, there is interest in taking it to
Broadway when its run ends here.
</P>
<P>
   Irving acknowledged that the whole notion of the play was at
first off-putting to him, in part because he found the constant
shifts between dialogue and narration jarring in the script. But
when he showed it to his son, Colin, an actor who is now an
understudy for several roles in the Taper production, he was
reassured that the words would play much differently on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Cider House'' was first produced at the Seattle Repertory
Theater in 1996, Irving avoided seeing it because he was struggling
to condense the novel into a two-hour screenplay (which is to be
directed by Lasse Hallstrom for Miramax this fall) and did not want
to be confused.
</P>
<P>
   When Irving finally saw Part 2 in Seattle last year, he
recalled: ``I was just bowled over by it, I just loved it. The only
thing that made me feel bad about any of it was how sorry I felt
for myself and my screenplay. I was envious of all the things they
were able to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   This is music to the ears of Parnell, Hulce and Ms. Jones, who
first met at Playwrights Horizons in New York in 1982 when Hulce
and Ms. Jones were acting in Parnell's play ``The Rise and Rise of
Daniel Rocket.'' They kept in touch over the years, and when Hulce
was approached nearly a decade ago about playing Homer Wells in a
proposed film of ``Cider House'' that never got off the ground, he
was immediately drawn to ``the great scope of the story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he realized that the moments in it that most excited him
``were all theatrical, they were not cinematic, they were moments
that required the audience's use of imagination, moments that would
be more potent if they weren't literal.''
</P>
<P>
   So he approached Ms. Jones, who by this time had founded a
Seattle repertory company called Book-It that had produced verbatim
dramatizations of about 150 short stories, and who was looking for
a big, fat novel to expand her horizons.
</P>
<P>
   Parnell joined the team and, with Irving's halting consent, they
began a series of workshop productions aimed at preserving the
self-consciously Dickensian sweep of ``Cider House,'' in which Dr.
Larch reads ``David Copperfield'' and ``Jane Eyre'' aloud to the
orphans.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the workshops and readings from the Juilliard School to
the Breadloaf Writers Conference in Vermont to the Lincoln Center
Theater, they finally reached Seattle, where Davidson saw the play
and commissioned yet another workshop in Los Angeles this spring
before the current run.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of actors would come in to audition for this and say to
us, `How the hell are you going to do this?''' Ms. Jones said
recently between rehearsals, during an interview with the three
collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about activating the narrative to then use it. It's
so hard for the actors to do, but once they get it, it's no more
difficult than Shakespeare, really, in a way, because it's
language-driven. And you have to play a very strong objective
through the language, through the narration, so that it not only
transports you in time and place, but transforms you through
psychic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows you to creep into the mind of a character and
therefore retain and preserve the author's full intention of what's
going on, not only physically, but mentally with the character, as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The form seems to be powerful. Hulce said that when the play was
first in development in Seattle, there were several instances when
members of the audience fainted at graphic descriptions of
obstetrical and surgical procedures. ``And we weren't doing
anything except speaking the language,'' Hulce said.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, ``Cider House,'' staged on a spare, stylized set of
louvered panels and catwalks designed by John Arnone, is full of
stern stuff, from haunting descriptions of the effects of botched
abortions to Homer's horror as he contemplates what he takes to be
an aborted fetus' smile. And, as befits a work by the author of
``The World According to Garp,'' the play is also a universe in
which every act of carnal indulgence carries momentous and painful
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the story is the avuncular Dr. Larch (played by
Michael Winters, a Seattle-based veteran), whose youthful
experience with the tragedies of back-alley abortions convinces him
he should, in the words of the play, deliver not only babies but
mothers; and Homer Wells (played by Josh Hamilton, a young New York
actor), the orphan who becomes the doctor's beloved surrogate son
and sorcerer's apprentice. The moral and intellectual disagreement
between the emotionally scarred and celibate doctor and his
wistful, wide-eyed charge becomes the pivot for a three-generation
tale that also examines topics from 20th-century class tensions to
the socio-sexual implications of drive-in movies.
</P>
<P>
   For Parnell, who is used to telling &LR; his own stories as a
playwright (he is also the author of ``The Sorrows of Stephen'' and
``Flaubert's Latest,'' among others), the narrative form sometimes
posed particular challenges, as in the big set-piece abortion
debate between Homer and Larch near the end of Part 1. Would
injecting the author's narrative into what would otherwise stand as
a classic dueling dialogue ``let the audience down a little bit,''
or would it ``force the audience into the character's mind because
we're able to say what the inner voice of that character is
saying,'' he debated.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ms. Jones said, keeping most of the narration seemed
the way to stay closest to the world of John Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Parnell likened the intense collaborative process to the demands
of fine-tuning a musical comedy in out-of-town tryouts. ``We'll get
to a point and decide, no, this has to be done more quickly, or it
can be done partly in narrative and partly in dialogue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the creative team are quick to say that Part 2
posed the biggest dramaturgical problems. At that po)nt in the
story, Homer leaves the orphanage to work on an apple farm, whose
workaday rules (often broken) give the play its title, and a raft
of new characters are introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we let Larch and Homer get too far away from each other,
then we don't have that heartbeat of the story anymore,'' Ms. Jones
said. ``And Homer becomes a wait-and-see type person in muah of
Part 2, which is really hard to activate in some ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the novel, the play avoids easy answers to the moral issue
at its core, but still makes clear its sympathies are in favor of a
woman's privacy, and her right to choose whether she can perform
what Irving calls the ``act of service'' that is childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   The chance to grapple with that ce.tral thesis is a big part of
what has propelled Hulce to put his acting career on hold for the
last two years, and moved Ms. Jones and Parnell to devote so much
of their lives to what Parnell says has become a kind of home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being what I considered the `womb' here, the women's issues
have been highly motivating and challenging,'' Ms. Jones said.
``And how beautifully both characters can argue for the right to
choice continues to be moving to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with abortion under renewed attack around the nation,
and with nearly 60 percent of all physicians who perform abortions
now over 65 years of age and many younger doctors declining to
perform them, or even to learn how, Irving says he finds his story
``more topical now than when the book was published.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cider House'' remains his second-best-selling book worldwide,
after ``A Prayer for Owen Meany'' and far ahead of ``Garp,''
popular perceptions to the contrary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of places, when it was published, people said, `Oh, it's
kind of quaint, that issue's behind us,''' Irving said. ``The
crisis of abortion rights laid pretty low, and people were,
wrongly, I think, taking for granted a right that had barely been
in existence for 10 years. And especially younger people, who had
no experience in their sexually conscious lives of a time when it
wasn't available, were comfortable taking for granted that if they
needed it, it would be there. That right has to be protected again
and again.'' &QL;

`SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH': TARNISHED GODDESS, ALLOY OF IRON AND PAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.)

 By BEN BRANTLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``I like you,'' says the boy to the bizarre,
larger-than-life creature in his bed. ``You're a nice monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the boy, as it happens, is a burned-out case, 29 going on
dead; the object of his endearments isn't exactly Puff the Magic
Dragon, either, but a boozed-up, washed-up, sex-addicted movie star
named Alexandra del Lago.
</P>
<P>
   The young man has a point, though. Miss del Lago is an awfully
nice _ and, yes, even lovable _ monster, at least as portrayed by
Elizabeth Ashley in the Shakespeare Theater's revival of Tennessee
Williams' ``Sweet Bird of Youth.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest interpretation of Williams' overheated tale of a
Hollywood diva and her gigolo, which seemed the dernier cri in
lurid adult drama when it opened on Broadway in 1959, has been a
popular hit in Washington, and it's easy to understand why. Ms.
Ashley is giving the kind of barnstorming, crowd-courting star
performance that you rarely see on a stage these days. She seems
high not on the little pink pills that are Alexandra's favorites
but on the thrill of having a live audience to play with.
</P>
<P>
   She's an intense presence, for sure, but also a comfortingly
benign one, and the warmth she gives off is as much maternal as
erotic. While her Alexandra may have spent much of her recent life
in a haze of intoxication and hangovers, there is nothing numb
about her. Indeed, by the end of the production, which has been
unevenly directed by Michael Kahn, this decadent, derelict screen
goddess emerges as a role model: a vital, tenacious and
compassionate survivor whose version of rolling with the punches is
just a little more literal than most people's.
</P>
<P>
   If your main acquaintance with Alexandra (a k a the Princess
Kosmonopolis) is through Geraldine Page's electric, hyperneurotic
performance in the original stage production and movie version,
this portrait won't jibe with your memories of the character. Ms.
Ashley appears to have conceived the Princess as a later
incarnation of the life-affirming Maggie in Williams' ``Cat on a
Hot Tin Roof,'' in which Ms. Ashley memorably starred in Kahn's
Broadway revival in 1975 _ that is, if Maggie had dropped her limp
Brick and moved to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   It's an approach that strips the play of much of its darkness
and troubled ambivalence. All the same, Ms. Ashley is great fun to
watch, while crucially reminding you that Williams' female
characters weren't all wilting neurasthenics a la Blanche DuBois
and Alma Winemiller. The real trouble is that this Princess blows
everyone else, including the gifted Michael Hayden as Chance Wayne,
Alexandra's pet stud, off the stage. Given that the Princess is
absent for a good third of the play, this is even more of a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, it has always been a problem. In an earlier
version, presented in Miami in 1956, ``Bird'' was effectively a
two-character play, composed of what are now its first and third
acts. In transforming the work for Broadway with the director Elia
Kazan, Williams shakily expanded the story surrounding Chance's
return to his hometown in Florida, where he is awaited by the girl
he done wrong but still loves, her vengeful politician of a father
and the sort of grisly fate that tends to befall Williams' young
men.
</P>
<P>
   The embellishments have a Williams-by-the-numbers quality, and
you can't help comparing them with more completely drawn versions
of the same thing. Heavenly Finley (here played by Elizabeth
Sastre), who has undergone sterilizing surgery after contracting
syphilis from Chance, is a stick-figure version of the imperiled
Catharine in ``Suddenly Last Summer,'' and Boss Finley (David
Sabin), her fire-breathing father, is a grossly politicized cartoon
of Big Daddy in ``Cat.'' And the threat of castration by committee,
a Williams specialty, that hangs over Chance is given more urgency
and vividness in ``Orpheus Descending.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kahn nor his actors succeed in animating these wooden,
morality-play statues. Sabin does provide an intelligent, measured
blueprint of a performance, an exaggerated counterpoint of bluster
and calm, but it never assumes human flesh. As his understandably
sullen children, Ms. Sastre and Willis Sparks are merely
mechanical, when an enlivening touch of camp would, for once, be
welcome. Samuel Maupin, as a terminally corrupted doctor, and Robin
Moseley, as Finley's forthright mistress, mercifully give more
credible dimensions to their slender parts.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden, in the role originated by Paul Newman, is at least by no
means wooden. This appealing young actor, who shone in the New York
revivals of ``Carousel'' and ``All My Sons,'' would seem to be a
fine choice for Chance, the best-looking boy from St. Cloud, Fla.,
who went on to fail as an actor and succeed as a hustler. But here
he is all exposed nerves and magnolia accent, pronouncing
``terror'' as ``Tara,'' a male cousin to Blanche DuBois.
</P>
<P>
   You can sense the character's pain but not his craftiness or the
remains of his swaggering confidence; it's hard to imagine him ever
having been the idolized golden boy that Chance once was. As a
consequence, what should be a pas de deux of mutual dependence and
power-struggling between Chance and the Princess as they fester in
an expensive hotel suite, is largely a solo act.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Ms. Ashley's Alexandra pleads with Chance to indulge
her, physically and emotionally, he registers as a fragile,
whirling toy that she could step on and crush whenever she chose.
She's Stanley, if you will, to his Blanche. ``When monster meets
monster, one monster has to give way,'' the Princess bellows, and
though the conclusion is foregone, the couple's scenes demand more
adversarial tension than Hayden can give them.
</P>
<P>
   This imbalance doesn't stop the cyclone of Ms. Ashley's
performance, which is nicely set off by the calm, abstract elegance
of Michael Yeargan's set and Howell Binkley's lighting. Her
throaty, cigarette-scarred voice, which seems to issue from a
watery grave, is the voice of the hangover eternal. And taking
disgusted inventory of her fleshy torso encased in a black satin
slip or checking out the merchandise beneath Hayden's pajamas,
she's a bawdy delight.
</P>
<P>
   Her Princess never seems potentially tragic or even pathetic,
however, which isn't necessarily a good thing in a character
defined by lost beauty and an awareness of what Williams called
``the enemy, time.'' Ms. Ashley delivers her monologues on these
subjects with a blowsy, attention-fixing charm. But you keep
looking for the depths of fear to explain Alexandra's desperate
behavior; what you're given instead is a plucky, game-for-anything
attitude and a ``c'est la vie'' shrug.
</P>
<P>
   The Princess, by the way, was partly inspired by the excessive,
hedonistic Tallulah Bankhead. But Williams, who had been living
with the discontents of fame for more than a decade when the play
was written, also admitted: ``I was Alexandra del Lago from start
to finish. I've probably made every speech she made. And I meant
them twice as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Seen in this context, Ms. Ashley's performance takes on a
poignant glow of generosity and affection. The actress became close
to Williams during the revival of ``Cat,'' and she knows very well
that, for all his much-publicized breakdowns and addictions, the
dramatist was a tough old bird who kept on writing until he died.
It's the self-amused, self-dramatizing and finally self-aware
survivor that Ms. Ashley pulls to the surface here. Even if the
performance doesn't always serve the play, it's refreshing to see a
Williams heroine enjoy herself with such gusto.

`BROTHER': WILD WEST? NYET, ST. PETERSBURG 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you believe the portrait of St. Petersburg presented by
Aleksei Balabanov's terrifically stylish gangster film ``Brother,''
the former Leningrad has become a lawless, shoot-'em-up frontier
town in the post-Soviet era. While the city's rootless youths
clutch voraciously at the cheesiest elements of Western pop
culture, warring outlaw factions have turned the city into an
Eastern European version of 1930s Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The film's central character, Danila (Sergei Bodrov Jr.), is a
baby-faced young hoodlum who arrives in town fresh out of the army
and goes to work for his brother Viktor (Viktor Suhorukov), who
runs a murder-for-hire business connected to the feuding Russian
mafia.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the film, Danila, a sleepy-eyed dolt obsessed with
a mediocre Russian rock band named Nautilus, has cut a lethal swath
through the city's underworld and is ready to move on to greener
pastures, namely Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   During his stay in St. Petersburg, Danila meets Kat (Mariya
Zhukova), a Russian version of a New York club kid who hangs out at
McDonald's and will do anything for dollars to subsidize her
passions for drugs and disco. He lives briefly with a hard-boiled
trolley car driver and part-time prostitute named Sveta (Svetlana
Pismichenko) whose husband is in prison.
</P>
<P>
   From the movie's opening scene, in which Danila lands in trouble
after interrupting the filming of a music video and tussling with a
security guard, ``Brother'' suggests that St. Petersburg is a
Darwinian battleground where everything is up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The center of warfare is a sprawling outdoor market where rival
gangs are struggling for the power to extort protection money from
the hundreds of intimidated vendors. Ethnic and regional rivalries
abound. Danila befriends a German who maintains that ``what's good
for the Russian is bad for the German.'' Viktor is contemptuously
referred to by his rivals as ``the Tatar.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooking up with Viktor, whom he has idolized since childhood,
Danila is assigned to do his dirtiest work, and he brings a strong,
primitive sense of right and wrong to his murderous duties. He also
quickly becomes addicted to the instant power he commands when he
flashes a gun. When a couple of dhugs refuse to pay their fare on a
streetcar, he relishes playing the hero by pulling out his weapon
and sending them scurrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother,'' which opens Wednesday at the Film Forum, has a
thread of cynical humor that connects it to the American gangster
movies of the 1930s as well as to more recent films like
``Goodfellas'' that examine the flashier trappings of macho
gangster culture with a satirical eye. Glamour and power in
Danila's world are defined by the wad of cash he carries around and
from which he casually peels off $100 bills and dispenses as gifts
when the spirit moves him.
</P>
<P>
   More than his gun, Danila's most precious possessions are his CD
player and his growing collection of Nautilus albums. The
shortsightedness of his morality is evidenced in a scene where he

   Bodrov's Danila is queasily sympathetic as a killer whose
touching familial loyalty turns out to be sadly misplaced. In the
movie's most cynical joke, he emerges as both the most deadly and
the most morally consistent character in a world where loyalty
counts for little and brute force rules.

TREASURY BOND PRICES FALL WITH THE DOLLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of Treasury securities fell for the first time
in three days Tuesday as the dollar slumped in world currency
trading.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond declined 15/32, to 107
16/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from
the price, rose to 5.60 percent, from 5.57 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts pointed out that bonds have moved in tandem with the
dollar recently. And Tuesday the dollar slumped after statements
from Japan increased expectations of an income tax cut to help pull
that nation out of its recession.
</P>
<P>
   Several media reported that a Japanese official said Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had said that government tax changes
would include an income tax cut. Some analysts noted that the
comments appeared to run counter to remarks the prime minister made
the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are watching to see to what extent the Japanese commit
themselves to tax cuts, because a permanent cut could dry up the
flight to U.S. Treasury securities, limiting further rallies in the
American market. Still many remain convinced that the weakened
Asian economies will place a drag on the U.S. economy and continue
to help subdue inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Burtnick, an analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said
trading was light and was mostly currency driven.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bond market,'' he said, ``is trading very close to the
high end of its most recent trading range, an indication that
people now need to see more weakness in the economy before rates
can go significantly lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have also seen some selling in Treasury securities, as
dealers set up for a growing supply of corporate debt expected to
hit the market this week, something in the neighborhood of about $6
billion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the municipal bond market Tuesday, $1.02 billion of Detroit
Metropolitan Wayne County Airport revenue bonds were priced through
underwriters led by Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The securities are in two parts with the bulk, $859.6 million
series A, priced to yield a maximum 5.35 percent for a bond due in
2028. For a bond due in 2022, the yield was 5.33 percent. For
shorter maturities, yields ranged from 4.30 percent for an issue
due in 2002 to 5.31 percent for an issue due in 2019.
</P>
<P>
   In the $163.6 million series B, the maximum yield was 5.22
percent for a bond due in 2028 and 5.19 percent for a bond due in
2023, with shorter maturities initially priced to yield from 4.25
percent in 2003 to 5.17 percent in 2018.
</P>
<P>
   Both series carry insurance from the Municipal Bond Investors
Assurance Corp. covering interest and principal payment, which
gives the bonds a triple-A rating from Moody's Investors Service
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp.

SENATORS PROPOSE EXCLUDING GUN MAKERS FROM LEGAL LIABILITY LID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Democratic senators announced Tuesday they want
to keep gun manufacturers from benefiting from a lid on lawsuit
damages that the Senate is considering for other small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Robert Torricelli of
New Jersey said they would seek to amend pending product-liability
legislation so that makers and sellers of guns wouldn't benefit
from a $250,000 cap on punitive damages that businesses with fewer
than 25 people and less than $5 million in sales would face.
</P>
<P>
   The bill already would exclude tobacco companies and makers of
silicone breast implants from its legal protections.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said damage suits against firearm manufacturers is
the only way to force the firms to put child safety locks on guns
and to stop designing guns designed to evade airport metal
detectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace can protect some of these abuses if there is
liability,'' Torricelli told a news conference, adding he wants to
``keep the court house door open.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said small businesses as defined by the bill
manufacture one-quarter of all the guns sold in America. Some
30,000 Americans are victims of gun violence each year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no product manufactured or sold in America subject to
more abuse or damaging to more lives than guns,'' Torricelli said.
``Gun manufacturers have not only failed to improve their products
but have gone to great difficulties to evade the law in their
design and manufacture.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said the product-liability legislation in the Senate
is ``flawed'' because it excludes tobacco companies from its legal
protections but allow gun and ammunition manufacturers and dealers
to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the same level of accountability should really apply
to gun manufacturers that applies to tobacco manufacturers,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said there are signs that public sentiment and the
courts are turning against gun manufacturers, citing the California
case three weeks ago in which an Oakland judge allowed a lawsuit to
proceed against Beretta U.S.A. Corp. for failing to put a child
safety device on one of its guns. In that case, 15-year-old Kenzo
Dix of Berkeley was killed by a schoolmate who pointed a Beretta
with an empty ammunition magazine at him, not realizing that a
round was already in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said legal recourse in such cases must remain open
since federal safety agencies have no jurisdiction to regulate
guns.
</P>
<P>
   She said Republican senators who excluded tobacco companies from
the bill's liability protections did not exclude the gun industry
because ``they didn't want to incur the wrath'' of the National
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Tanya Metaksa, chief lobbyist for the National Rifle
Association, said the amendment is being proposed because Feinstein
and Torricelli ``are intent on shrinking and then strangling the
gun industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been unable to pass legislation on the consumer side
for more gun control, so now they're trying to do it on the supply
side,'' Metaksa said.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein and Torricelli have sponsored other measures to limit
the private ownership of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Metaksa said the NRA will urge the Senate to defeat the
amendment, adding, ``I think it's going to be real close.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who has pressed for child safety
locks on guns, said the legal protections for small businesses in
the product-liability bill would let many manufacturers of assault
weapons and Saturday Night Specials ``off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, who opposes the overall product-liability bill, said it
would enable big gun manufacturers to split into two companies to
get the legal protection provided to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives a bullet-proof vest to every gun manufacturer and
would allow lawsuits to just bounce off them,'' Boxer said.

POPE URGES REGULAR ATTENDANCE OF SUNDAY MASS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Hoping to shake his flock loose from the grip of secular
pastimes and preoccupations, Pope John Paul II reminded Catholics
on Tuesday of their obligation to attend Sunday Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In a 95-page apostolic letter, the pope wrote, ``Unfortunately,
when Sunday loses its fundamental meaning and becomes merely a part
of a weekend, it can happen that people stay locked within a
horizon so limited that they can no longer see the heavens.''
</P>
<P>
   Battling a modern world where church attendance is declining and
a growing number of Catholics ignore church teachings on divorce
and birth control, Pope John Paul has often reminded Catholics of
the fundamental rules of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   But by affirming the primacy of Sunday worship in an apostolic
letter, the 30th he has published in his 20 years as pope, John
Paul II also underscored what he wants his spiritual legacy to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning of my pontificate,'' he wrote, ``I have not
ceased to repeat, `Do not be afraid! Open, open wide the doors to
Christ!' In the same way, today I would strongly urge everyone to
rediscover Sunday: Do not be afraid to give your time to Christ!''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, entitled ``Dies Domini,'' the Day of the Lord,
the pope reaffirmed that the church considers it a sin if a
Catholic fails to go to Mass weekly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The percentage of those attending the liturgy is strikingly low,
he wrote. Last month the pope traveled to Austria, where only 17
percent of Catholics regularly attend Sunday services. In Italy the
figure is 28 percent. And in some parts of Latin America the figure
drops below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the distractions of modern life make it
difficult for Catholics to follow their faith. ``Changes in
socioeconomic conditions have often led to profound modifications
of social behavior and hence of the character of Sunday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's message was a comfort to Catholic leaders around the
world who have also been battling entrenched cultural attitudes
that they complain encroach on church teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal John O'Connor, the archbishop of New York, recently
created a stir when he said he would boycott all Major League
Baseball games this year because some were held on Good Friday. He
was also heavily criticized for complaining about Little League
games on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, the pope did not condemn sports or other forms of
leisure that may distract the faithful from their Sunday duties.
</P>
<P>
   And in soccer-mad Italy, where sociologists speak not of soccer
moms but soccer widows, the Italian clergy has been careful not to
formally ask Italian soccer leagues to stop playing on Sundays, an
act that would be viewed by many Italians as tantamount to treason.
</P>
<P>
   At a Vatican news conference Tuesday, Bishop Geraldo Majella
Agnelo, secretary of the Vatican Department of Worship, was asked
whether Catholics should avoid soccer on Sundays. ``Sport is also
part of that letting off of steam on Sunday,'' he replied. ``There
is no harm in sports.'' Agnelo is from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who begins a six-week summer holiday Wednesday, made
it clear that the Lord's day should be set aside by the faithful as
a day of rest, reflection and acts of charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christians,'' he said, ``are obliged in conscience to arrange
their Sunday rest in a way that allows them to take part in the
Eucharist, refraining from work and activities that are
incompatible with the sanctification of the Lord's day, with its
characteristic joy and necessary rest for spirit and body.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the reforms of Vatican Council II, many Catholic rules,
like requirements that the faithful abstain from meat on Fridays or
fast from midnight before taking Communion, have been loosened.
</P>
<P>
   In many dioceses, bishops now permit Catholics to meet their
obligations for Sunday Mass by attending on Saturday evenings. But
the church still considers it a sin for a Catholic to fail to
attend weekly Mass without a good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual consequences of such a slip are less clear,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Catholic refuses to got to Mass, then he excludes himself
from the church,'' said Bishop Piero Marini, the Vatican's director
of liturgical celebrations. ``But if someone has a headache or some
other reason to skip a Mass, I could not bring myself to condemn
them for all eternity.'' &QL;

PHONE CHIEF ARMSTRONG VOWS THAT AT&AMP;T-TCI MERGER WILL GO THROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: FILED in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 BY NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ AT&AMP;T Chairman C. Michael Armstrong told Congress
Tuesday that the proposed merger between the nation's largest
long-distance phone company and Tele-Communications Inc., its
second-largest cable TV firm, will go through despite a sharp drop
in AT&AMP;T stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is done. The deal will go through pending a
shareholders' vote,'' Armstrong said in response to a query from
Sen. Herbert H. Kohl, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, who questioned AT&AMP;T's financial muscle in face of the
``dramatic drop'' in the company's stock, asked, ``What assurances
are there that the deal will go through as planned and the company
will have the capital to upgrade'' the systems of the combined
firm.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T stock closed at $65.38 on June 24, the day the proposed
merger was announced, then skidded about 10 points in little more
than a week. It rebounded somewhat Tuesday, closing at $56.19.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong noted that AT&AMP;T has gone through a period of ``churn''
and said that ``whenever you have churn, generally, the stock goes
down.'' He also said, ``I anticipate that shareholder value will
not only be restored but will appreciate.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no change in the original merger plan, and TCI
will continue an $1.8 billion cable-system upgrade in the meantime,
he declared.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the assurances during a hearing of the Senate Judiciary
Subcommittee on Antitrust, Business Rights and Competition, adding
that AT&AMP;T still ``has an outstanding balance sheet and has an
outstanding cash flow.''
</P>
<P>
   The merged conglomerate would offer consumers virtually all
electronic services such as long distance and cellular phone calls,
cable TV and high-speed access to the Internet, the global computer
network.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would benefit both AT&AMP;T and its customers, Armstrong
said, predicting that it would heighten, not kill, competition and
provide more services to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said that the Bell companies, GTE ``and other
incumbent local carriers will not sit idly by as TCI continues to
upgrade its network and add telephone service capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the merger, which he hopes will be approved within nine
months, would allow AT&AMP;T to gain direct access to households
through TCI's owned and affiliated cable lines, which serve about a
third of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, chairman of the Judiciary panel, asked
if the $32 billion merger would lead to control of the information
industry by only a few powerful owners.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong replied, ``One word we must adhere to is `open.' We
have to make sure the markets stay open. ... We have to make sure
we are open to technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable upgrade includes a two-way capability for Internet and
information services that, by 1999, will be 60 percent complete,
Armstrong said. Under the merger, AT&AMP;T would be able to deliver the
services to customers in 2000 at an average cost of $300 to $500
per household, he added.

PHONE CHIEF ARMSTRONG VOWS THAT AT&AMP;T-TCI MERGER WILL GO THROUGH

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ AT&AMP;T Chairman C. Michael Armstrong told Congress
Tuesday that the proposed merger between the nation's largest
long-distance phone company and Tele-Communications Inc., its
second-largest cable TV firm, will go through despite a sharp drop
in AT&AMP;T stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is done. The deal will go through pending a
shareholders' vote,'' Armstrong said in response to a query from
Sen. Herbert H. Kohl, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, who questioned AT&AMP;T's financial muscle in face of the
``dramatic drop'' in the company's stock, asked, ``What assurances
are there that the deal will go through as planned and the company
will have the capital to upgrade'' the systems of the combined
firm.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T stock closed at $65.38 on June 24, the day the proposed
merger was announced, then skidded about 10 points in little more
than a week. It rebounded somewhat Tuesday, closing at $56.19.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong noted that AT&AMP;T has gone through a period of ``churn''
and said that ``whenever you have churn, generally, the stock goes
down.'' He also said, ``I anticipate that shareholder value will
not only be restored but will appreciate.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no change in the original merger plan, and TCI
will continue an $1.8 billion cable-system upgrade in the meantime,
he declared.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the assurances during a hearing of the Senate Judiciary

outstanding cash flow.''

`SAM SHEPARD': BEYOND THE WRITING AND ACTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(nk) 
 By WILL JOYNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a strong, silent type on the movie screen and, more
important, the author of plays that are loud eruptions of anguished
language, Sam Shepard has long been an odd, contradictory presence
on the American cultural scene.
</P>
<P>
   He's well-known but unknown, handsome and seductive but
willfully remote. He's almost too easily the archetype of the
authentic American, at home in the wide open spaces but not really
at home anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   He's also notoriously publicity-shy, which is primarily what
makes ``Sam Shepard: Stalking Himself,'' on PBS Wednesday night at
9, such a surprising viewing experience.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to snippets of Shepard's emotionally grueling plays
and interviews with the actors who have lovingly interpreted them,
this hourlong program includes a close conversation with Shepard.
And in his abashed, semaphoric way, he gives an eloquent account of
where he comes from and what he's about as a relentlessly creative
person.
</P>
<P>
   It's an appropriately colorful tale, which is effectively
illustrated with a melange of old photographs and filmed vistas,
giving ``Stalking Himself'' the feel of a social document as well
as a personal one. At 18, Shepard had just left a troubled home in
the desert town of Duarte, Calif., and was working as a newspaper
deliveryman in Pasadena when he spotted an ad for a traveling
theatrical company.
</P>
<P>
   He signed on, hopped on a bus and discovered what he describes
as the ``mobility of theater,'' a life force that soon landed him
in New York City, right in the middle of the Off Off Broadway
explosion that was happening at places like Theater Genesis at St.
Marks Church in the Bowery.
</P>
<P>
   By night, Shepard worked as a busboy at the Village Gate, where
he had a rare view of such jazz geniuses as Thelonious Monk and
Nina Simone. By day, he started to write orphic, absurdist plays
that no one seemed to understand but that almost immediately won
him the acclaim and support that would continue as he moved on to
London and to the world of movies.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his account, Shepard offers moving if spare
reflections on his times. ``Well, for me, there was nothing fun
about the 60s,'' he says, with a conflicted look in his eyes that
tells even more. But his words are most moving when he is talking
about the point in the late 70s when he realized he needed to write
drama about his traumatic childhood, especially his relationship
with his haunted father. ``I didn't really want to tiptoe in
there,'' he says. ``But I figured I'd better.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, of course, and what resulted were his best creations,
plays of the 1980s like ``True West,'' ``Fool for Love'' and ``A
Lie of the Mind.'' (At 10, PBS is rebroadcasting the 1984 ``Great
Performances'' version of ``True West,'' starring John Malkovich
and Gary Sinise, proof of Shepard's accomplishment.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Stalking Himself'' includes occasional revelations about
Shepard's private life. It's rather stunning to learn, for example,
that this man who won an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the
ace pilot Chuck Yeager in ``The Right Stuff'' has refused to fly in
airplanes for many years. But the program is really about Shepard
and his work, and what it reveals most assuredly is that he really
is the authentic American artist, always traveling in the direction
that he alone chooses.
</P>
<P>
   As Edward Albee, a playwright Shepard admires and has much in
common with, puts it: ``Sam was always taking chances, always being
original. Somebody who was willing to fail and fail interestingly.
And if you're willing to fail interestingly, you tend to succeed
interestingly.''

THE FRENCH, WHO AGREE ON NOTHING, UNITE BEHIND A SOCCER TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A strange thing has happened on the way to the World Cup
final: this fractious country, never in agreement about anything,
eternally divided, deeply skeptical, has united around a soccer
team that is now lauded by workers, women and even intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup had been approached with the usual grumbling.
There was the cost: $433 million for the main stadium alone. There
were the predictable Left Bank comments about the inanity of eleven
grown men chasing a ball. And there were the dismal pre-tournament
showings of the French team, confirmation, if any were needed, that
an early exit was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   There was also something deeper. This is a country that has
traditionally been touched by the individual endurance of the Tour
de France bicycle race, by the rugged splendor of rugby and by the
grace and elegance of the Roland Garros tennis tournament. As for
``le foot,'' it was foolish.
</P>
<P>
   But a shift has occurred, fleeting perhaps, remarkable without
doubt. In the place of the dismissive ``bof,'' accompanied by
Gallic shrug, a wave of enthusiasm has engulfed the French as their
team, on home ground, has reached the semifinal, a stage it has
reached on three previous occasions only to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   This time, says coach Aime Jacquet, ``we are going all the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how far France does go will be decided in Wednesday's
semifinal against Croatia. Meanwhile, the team has already become
the upbeat symbol of a country that is experiencing sturdy economic
growth for the first time in years and appears to be emerging from
a protracted bout of the blues.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarterfinal match against Italy last Friday, played
at 4:30 p.m., the country shut down. Renault and Citroen plants
were closed. The employees of the ministry of solidarity and
employment sat watching the match on a large screen with their
minister, Martine Aubry. Cafes were full of cheering fans. When the
game was finally won in a penalty shootout, the Champs Elysees
became the scene of joyous mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not too enthusiastic at first, but then this strange
fever grabs you,'' said Frederique Chevalier, who works for an
airline company. ``There is a strange atmosphere at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys suggest that women like Ms. Chevalier have by no means
shunned the World Cup, as expected before the tournament started.
While most men have watched at least eight games, a majority of
women have seen at least four, according to media research centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the tournament started, I did not know anybody who
believed we could reach the final,'' said Noel Henoeque. ``But I
always thought we could do it and I still do.'' Henoeque has found
one of more than 15,000 temporary jobs generated by the world cup,
serving coffee at a stand of one of the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   With such enthusiasm prevailing, and jobs even being created, it
was only natural that ``le foot'' be suddenly elevated to the realm
of political debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I salute the unity of a team representative of French
diversity,'' Lionel Jospin, the socialist prime minister, said this
week. Referring to the sons of North African immigrants known as
``Beurs,'' he added, ``When I see Blacks and Beurs, with the French
flag, singing the Marseillaise, I find that these are timely
images.''
</P>
<P>
   France has been deeply concerned for some time with the apparent
fragmentation of its republican ideal, the model that allowed
generations of Portuguese, Italian and other immigrants to be
transformed into patriotic French citizens largely through an
excellent public school system.
</P>
<P>
   High unemployment and the spread of bleak suburbs populated
largely by out-of-work immigrants have dented this ideal.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is a soccer team to suggest that integration still
works in France. Zinedine Zidane, the star midfielder, is of
Algerian descent. Marcel Dessailly and Lilian Thuram, two members
of a four-man defense that has conceded only one goal in five
matches, are black. David Trezeguet, a striker, was born in
Argentina. Youri Djorkaeff, another striker, is of Georgian origin.
The contrast with the monochrome German and Italian teams had
indeed been striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hybrid team thumbs its nose at the National Front,''
Francois Armanet wrote this week in the daily Liberation, referring
to the xenophobic right-wing party that takes about 15 percent of
the French vote. ``One can admire it without chauvinism. These
players belong fully to the modern world.''
</P>
<P>
   Even intellectuals and writers, who once scoffed, have
discovered that soccer is an area for exhilarating debate. Where
soccer was once dismissed as a mere ``opium of the people,''
exploited by dictatorships intent on distracting their peoples, it
has now been elevated to a higher plane.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the writer Christophe Gallaz opined this week that, ``When
we applaud Youri Djorkaeff sprinting diagonally across the opposing
defense and scoring, we are consoled about our impotence before our
own objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was intriguing. Unfortunately Djorkaeff has in fact
proved largely impotent before his own objectives, scoring just one
goal in the World Cup, and that from a penalty. But when soccer
enters the realm of psychology, it is a fair certainty that it has
at last penetrated the inner sanctum of French intellectual debate.
</P>
<P>
   Several decades ago, the French writer Albert Camus observed
that, ``All I know about morality and the duties we all have I owe
to soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recent days, his was a voice in the wilderness, but now
France has found a new popular identity. If the country can beat
Croatia and reach its first ever final, who knows what may happen. &QL;

VW AGREES TO COMPENSATE WARTIME SLAVE LABORERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In an abrupt reversal from a decision a
month ago, Volkswagen AG has agreed to set up a fund to compensate
workers who were forced into slave labor in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse announcement three weeks after the company had been
threatened with a lawsuit, Volkswagen said that its decision was
``in recognition of the historical and moral obligations'' to those
who were forced to work in its factories under the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen has acknowledged that it used slave labor. According
to a history financed by the company two years ago, it employed
15,000 slave laborers in the war.
</P>
<P>
   But Volkswagen executives had until Tuesday insisted that
compensating victims was a government responsibility, because the
company had been acting on government orders. When a group that
represents former workers from Hungary threatened last month to
sue, a Volkswagen spokesman said that any direct compensation by
the company was simply ``not possible'' under current law.
</P>
<P>
   Though reversing its position, the Volkswagen board declined to
say how much it would pay or whether it would make payments to
victims' families. The company said it would announce details in
September.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those who campaigned against the company declared victory
Tuesday. ``It is an unconditional surrender,'' said Klaus von
Muenchhausen, a lecturer at the University of Bremen who began to
campaign last month on behalf of 30 former factory workers.
</P>
<P>
   Von Muenchhausen, who threatened to sue Volkswagen if it did not
offer compensation by the end of July, said the company's decision
was quite likely to strengthen those who pursued similar complaints
against other German wartime companies.
</P>
<P>
   Von Muenchhausen said the workers he represented had been Jewish
teen-agers who were captured in Hungary and taken to Auschwitz.
From there they were sent by rail to Volkswagen factories in
Wolfsburg. Today the former workers all live in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen apparently came under pressure from the government of
Lower Saxony, whose governor is Gerhard Schroeder, the Social
Democratic candidate for German chancellor. The government of Lower
Saxony owns 20 percent of Volkswagen, and Schroeder is on the
supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Von Muenchhausen said state officials had pressed Volkswagen
because they did not want to be dragged into a unpopular court
battle, particularly in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen may have had its reasons for choosing to sidestep an
ugly controversy. The company has just completed the acquisition of
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the British manufacturer of luxury cars,
and it is acquiring Lambourghini, the Italian sports car company.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Volkswagen's new flash and success in the
marketplace, some local political leaders were unwilling to stick
out their necks to defend the wartime record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is paradoxical to buy the world's luxury brands and on the
other side be so miserly,'' the head of the Lower Saxony
parliament, Rolf Wernstedt, said several weeks ago. &QL;

   The City Council of Benicia, Calif., has passed a resolution
welcoming Dixie, a 50-foot-tall Brachiosaurus that later this month
is to be carried from Dixon by helicopter to Benicia, to a resting
place in front of the headquarters of the discount chain Cigarettes
Cheaper!
</P>
<P>
   Dixie, which weighs 12 tons, is 71 feet long and has been

<TEXT>
<P>
   A major exhibition on Sigmund Freud at the Library of Congress
that was postponed in 1995 after budget cuts and protests by
critics _ including Freud's granddaughter, Sophie, who charged that
it was too favorable to the founder of psychoanalysis _ is finally
set to open on Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sigmund Freud: Conflict and Culture'' will open under the same
title, but it has been modified somewhat in response to criticism,
curator Michael S. Roth said last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will show Freud's contested legacy,'' Roth said. ``But it
will show that Freud was responding to issues that remain vital
today, such as explosive violence, and the fact that people remain
deeply troubled even though they have the capacity for satisfaction
in love and work.''
</P>
<P>
   A major emphasis throughout, Roth said, will be Freud's impact
on popular culture. The exhibition, he said, will feature 150
objects drawn from the library's vast Freud archives, the biggest
in the world. They will include a reproduction of Freud's analysand
couch and a painting by Freud's most famous patient, the Wolf Man,
depicting his dream of wolves sitting in a tree outside his window.
</P>
<P>
   Also included will be photographs, manuscripts and letters,
including a little-known letter from Freud to the mother of a
homosexual, which the library has borrowed from the Kinsey
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homosexuality is nothing to be ashamed of,'' wrote Freud, who
is often seen as condemning homosexuality. ``Many highly
respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been
homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The show will continue at the Library of Congress until Jan. 16
and then travel to the Jewish Museum in New York and to Los Angeles
and Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with the exhibition, Alfred A. Knopf is
publishing a catalog, actually a collection of essays edited by
Roth, some of them written by scholars who originally signed a
petition against the museum exhibition. They contended that the
Freud show would validate psychological practices that have no
scientific merit.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism began before the exhibition, originally planned for
1995, was even mounted. Peter Swales, an independent scholar who
has written that Freud had an affair with his sister-in-law, Minna
Bernays, organized the petition, which was signed by 42 writers and
scholars. Swales said at the time that the show had been
``conceived in bad faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The literary critic Frederick Crews called it an effort ``to
polish the tarnished image of a business that's heading into
Chapter 11.'' Sophie Freud, Freud's granddaughter, said she was
protesting the show because ``some of my grandfather's ideas have
become obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   The critics charged that the exhibition's advisory committee had
been stacked with Freud sympathizers and that the accompanying
catalog was to have essays written only by Freud partisans.
</P>
<P>
   The postponement came the same year that the Smithsonian
Institution had been accused of modifying an exhibition on the
Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, in
response to veterans' protests that the Japanese were being
portrayed as victims.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, who is associate director of the Getty Research Institute
for the History of Art and the Humanities, denies being a Freud
partisan. ``What's uncomfortable for them is I'm in neither camp,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Roth said he had taken the criticisms into account. ``The
protests ave me a chance to think about it,'' he said of the
exhibition. ``It has evolved, gone through various permutations.
Modifications have been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth also invited another prominent critic who had signed the
petition, Adolf Grunbaum, the Andrew Mellon Professor of Philosophy
at the University of Pittsburgh, to write an essay for the catalog.
Absent from both the advisory board, and the book, however, is
Swales, who originally organized the protest. ``I didn't invite
Swales because I didn't think his work was appropriate,'' Roth
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Freud exhibition will be divided into three parts, the last
of which ends with a rarely heard BBC recording of Freud speaking
in English. ``I started my professional activity as a neurologist
trying to bring release to my neurotic patients,'' Freud tells the
interviewer. ``I discovered some new and important facts about the
unconscious in psychic life, the role of instinctual urges and so
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The founder of psychoanalysis continues: ``Resistance was strong
and unrelenting. In the end I succeeded in acquiring pupils and
building up an international psychoanalytic association. But the
struggle is not yet over. My name is Sigmund Freud.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The exhibit's first part, ``Historical/Biographical,'' will
begin with Freud's formative years and include items from his
medical training, among them photographs of hysterics taken in the
1880s at a Paris hospital. One group, titled ``Passionate
Attitudes,'' shows women in their nightgowns, supposedly being
photographed in the middle of hysterical attacks. ``It illustrates
the move away from visualizing mental illness to Freud's method of
listening to it,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   There are also family photographs, including one of Freud's
mother, which Roth considered especially important. ``He was a man
who spent a lot of his professional life writing about his desire
to have sex with his mother,'' Roth said. ``He visited her every
day, and when she died, his reaction was that now he was free to
die. He couldn't do this to his mother while she was still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The second section, ``The Conscious and the Unconscious,'' will
deal with Freud's theories and how he used them to treat patients.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate repression, there will be a clip from a television
show, ``The Simpsons.'' ``Lisa,'' Homer Simpson says to his
daughter, ``the important thing is for your mother to repress what
happened, push it deep down inside her so she'll never annoy us
again.''
</P>
<P>
   A scene from the film ``Sex and the Single Girl'' will depict
the concept of transference. ``Are you attracted to me?'' Natalie
Wood, in the role of a psychiatrist, asks her patient, played by
Tony Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am, I am,'' Curtis says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with the way our doctor-patient relationship
is progressing,'' Ms. Wood tells him. ``You must realize, of
course, that this is simply a transference.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is a lighthearted vein running through the
exhibition, Roth said. ``We're putting the manuscript of Freud's
paper on fetishism on his consulting couch,'' he said. ``It's a
joke on people's fetishistic attitudes toward objects associated
with Freud.''
</P>
<P>
   The third section of the exhibition, ``From Psyche to
Civilization,'' will demonstrate the connection between Freud's
ideas and the wider society, including his theories on the origins
of civilization. Some of this section will be devoted to those who
broke away from Freud, like Jung and Adler. &QL;

SECRET SERVICE EMPLOYEES ORDERED TO TESTIFY IN LEWINSKY PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court panel, in a setback to
President Clinton, Tuesday ordered three Secret Service employees
to answer questions before the grand jury investigating whether
Clinton had an affair with former intern Monica S. Lewinsky and
urged her to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a Maryland grand jury launched an investigation into
whether Linda R. Tripp illegally tape-recorded her conversations
with Lewinsky. Tripp said the Maryland probe was ``politically
motivated,'' noting that it began while she was testifying Tuesday
for the third time before a grand jury in Washington about the
allegations involving Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, who lives in Howard County, Md., is being investigated
for possible violations of a state law prohibiting the
tape-recording of conversations without the consent of both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe today's announcement is the latest in a series of
attempts to intimidate me,'' Tripp said in a statement read by her
lawyer. ``This has occurred at the very moment I am testifying
before the federal grand jury. I am not intimidated in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge federal panel, in ordering the Secret Service
employees to testify, rejected the Clinton administration's
arguments that the president would be in greater danger of being
assassinated if he didn't feel comfortable talking in front of
agents assigned to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not think ... that the Secret Service has shown with
compelling clarity that failure to recognize the proposed privilege
will jeopardize the ability of the Secret Service effectively to
protect the president,'' the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a welcome victory for independent counsel Kenneth
W. Starr, who last week was criticized by a federal judge who threw
out the prosecutor's tax case against former Associate Attorney
General Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trust the Secret Service will now join us in helping the
grand jury gather information that is relevant to this
investigation,'' Starr said in a statement Tuesday. ``It is
fundamental in our country that all law enforcement officers
cooperate fully in responding to requests for relevant information
in a federal grand jury investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said the appeals court decision showed ``the rule of law
is not incompatible with the profound national interest in
protecting the life of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling upholds a decision by US District Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson, but is not final. Clinton administration lawyers
have the option of asking for a ruling by the full appeals court or
appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, which does not return
from summer recess until October.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling upholds a decision by US District Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson, but is not final. The Clinton administration has
the option of asking for a ruling by the full appeals court or
appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, which does not return
from summer recess until October.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling is expected to be appealed, but White House
spokesman James Kennedy said that decision will be made by the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not part of this case and will not play any role in
deciding what the next step will be,'' Kennedy said. Justice
Department officials said Tuesday they were disappointed with the
decision and would decide within seven days whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court has yet to rule on another crucial aspect of
Starr's investigation, whether deputy White House counsel Bruce
Lindsey must divulge his conversations with the president. The
White House has maintained the conversations are subject to
attorney-client privilege, but Starr has argued that Lindsey has no
such protection because he is not Clinton's personal attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been seeking testimony from three Secret Service
employees who may know if Clinton and Lewinsky were together.
Clinton and Lewinsky have each denied having an affair, but
Lewinsky reportedly boasted about such a relationship in
conversations secretly recorded by Tripp. Starr is investigating
whether Clinton or his associates tried to cover up evidence in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is in the midst of negotiating with Lewinsky's lawyers to
have her testify before the grand jury in exchange for immunity
from prosecution. If the Secret Service employees testify that they
saw Lewinsky in the White House with the president _ thus becoming
crucial witnesses _ it could put pressure on Lewinsky to make a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear, however, what the Secret Service workers
would say. There have been a variety of unconfirmed and retracted
reports about agents and members of the Secret Service's uniformed
division who supposedly saw Clinton and Lewinsky together.
</P>
<P>
   The administration opposed any testimony by the Secret Service
employees, arguing that Clinton and future presidents would be
unable to conduct their private business if they know anything they
say might be revealed in court. Former President Bush also told the
court that it would set a bad precedent to force Secret Service
agents to testify. The Secret Service also opposed such testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Former US Attorney Benito Romano, who served in the Bush
administration, called Tuesday's ruling ``an adverse development''
for the president. ``There are very few witnesses available to
testify _ the president, Ms. Lewinsky and presumably a handful of
people at the White House, presumably including Secret Service
agents,'' Romano said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Romano called the decision a ``wrong ruling''
because it could ``weaken the shield'' of protection around the
president. ``Taking the president's security detail and converting
them to possible witnesses could cause the president to hesitate to
be near his security detail and could cause him danger.''
</P>
<P>
   The three employees affected by the ruling are Secret Service
officers Gary Byrne and Brian Henderson and lawyer John Kelleher.
The three refused to answer certain questions posed by Starr's
office earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling was made by three Republican-appointed judges
who sit on the federal appeals court in Washington: Raymond
Randolph, Stephen Williams and Douglas Ginsburg. They said there is
no built-in ``privilege'' that exempts Secret Service employees
from having to testify. The judges also said it is up to Congress
to decide whether Secret Service employees should be granted such a
privilege.

'98 FRENCH TEAM FAR DIFFERENT THAN THE 80S VERSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ They are the spiritual offspring of the greatest
generation of French footballers ever. But, unlike the France teams
of the 1980s, they will not have to contend with Germany in the
World Cup semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, France will meet Croatia at Stade de France today, and
a victory will put Les Bleus in the championship game for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense of destiny about this team, which learned the
game from watching those teams of the 1980s and also from the
coaching of former players such as Michel Platini, president of the
organizing committee of France '98.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a much different team than the elegant squads of the
'80s, which had skillful, stylish midfielders such as Platini,
Alain Giresse, Jean Fernandez, and Dominique Rocheteau.
</P>
<P>
   Youri Djorkaeff and Zinedine Zidane provide technical brilliance
in midfield, yet the strengths of the team are rock-solid defenders
Laurent Blanc and Marcel Desailly, and midfield ball-winners Didier
Deschamps, Christian Karembeu, and Emmanuel Petit.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably a canard to say the French will accept only a
stylish brand of play _ so-called ``champagne soccer'' _ from the
national team. So far, the country seems quite satisfied with the
torturous progress of the team. After the glorious failures of
1958, when Just Fontaine set the World Cup record with 13 goals,
and the '80s, there is a feeling that substance will be as welcome
with or without style.
</P>
<P>
   France has scored just once in the last 234 minutes, edging
Paraguay in overtime and eliminating Italy on penalty kicks. The
front line has not scored since the first round, and only Thierry
Henry has more than one goal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, fans could not have been much more celebratory after the
penalty-kick victory over Italy, when they drove through Paris
honking horns late into the night. Possibly, French sensibilities
have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our national team is historically always too preoccupied with
the spectacle,'' Platini told Italy's La Gazzetta dello Sport.
``Now it is nearing the hour of the great result, that which we
deserved in the '80s, when we lost two semifinals against
Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Those French teams set high standards for the next generation,
which struggled to reconcile the balance between aesthetics and
results. Eric Cantona and David Ginola, who found riches and fame
in England, were considered two of the most brilliant of that
group, and they were blamed for the incredible failure to qualify
for USA '94, when France squandered leads to Bulgaria and Israel at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Cantona has retired, but Ginola remains the most effective
French left-side midfielder, though he has been excluded from the
national team.
</P>
<P>
   Since the disappointments of the '80s, there has been an
atmosphere of impending letdown about France. Ginola, whose
graceful play is reminiscent of previous French stars, is regarded
as a symbol of this.
</P>
<P>
   The mentality of the national team has changed, at the expense
of technical brilliance. It is unclear whether this is a result of
coach Aimee Jacquet's choices or the changing nature of the French
player, many of whom have honed their competitive instincts in
England and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be regarded as an old imbecile, saying that
everything that used to be was better,'' Platini said. ``However,
the midfielders and attackers of today would not make anyone from
my era jealous. Consequently, we have a game which is less
technical.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the ``FILS'' of Platini were anticipating a match with
Germany, seeking vengeance especially for the rough tactics German
goalkeeper Toni Schumacher had used at Spain '82. But Croatia could
provide just as difficult, and physical, a test.
</P>
<P>
   ``To quality for the quarterfinals was the minimum, the
semifinal is already an optimum result,'' Platini said. ``With this
assurance, from now on it will be a bonus for everyone _ the ideal
conditions to enter into legendary status.''

CALIFORNIA DEBATES HOW TO USE $4.4 BILLION SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Pete Wilson began his tenure here
seven summers ago with the largest budget gap that any state ever
faced, a $14.3 billion shortfall that forced him and the
Legislature to raise $7 billion in new taxes and slash spending by
the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   The budget was finally passed 17 days after the July 1 deadline,
and the next year the wrangling was even worse, with a record
63-day standoff over how to spread the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wilson is in his last year in office, contemplating another
run for the White House and eager to leave a legacy _ and
California is once again without a budget one week into the new
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, as in other state capitals buoyed by a strong
economy this season, the fight is over what to do with a surplus _
$4.4 billion generated by the Golden State's booming economic
recovery _ and while the question now is about cutting taxes and
expanding services, the debate is proving just as bitter as before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bigger problem, in a way,'' said John Burton, the
beleaguered Democratic leader of the state Senate, who noted that a
surplus _ in an election year to boot _ inspires less cooperation
and more partisanship than in tough times.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson agreed, saying dryly of his adversaries in the
Democratic-controlled Legislature, ``They seem to find it more
difficult to come to grips with plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurred on by states like Virginia and Arizona, where the issue
has proved to be political catnip, Wilson and his fellow
Republicans want a $3.6 billion cut in the state's vehicle-license
tax over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   That would amount to a 75 percent reduction in the unpopular
tax, a Depression-era relic that is based on 2 percent of a
vehicle's value (adjusted by a set depreciation schedule) and
translates into several hundred dollars a year for owners of newer
cars. Such a cut would also allow Wilson to claim that, overall, he
has reduced taxes more than he has raised them in his two terms in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Because the car tax revenues go to cities and counties to
finance local services, the Democrats contend that cutting the tax
could jeopardize police protection if the economy took a turn for
the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in what was regarded as no more than an opening bid,
the Democratic-controlled Senate unanimously passed an alternative,
a one-year, one-quarter-cent cut in the state's 6 percent sales
tax, and on Monday, the Assembly followed suit. But Wilson derided
the idea as ``much too little and much too brief'' and vowed to
veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said in an interview that he expected face-to-face
negotiations with the governor and the Democratic Assembly speaker,
Antonio Villaraigosa, to begin soon, but the Assembly and Senate
have yet to agree on an overall budget plan of their own.
</P>
<P>
   And Burton and Villaraigosa have held their posts for just a few
months, replacing colleagues forced to move on by term limits,
while Wilson, himself barred from seeking a third term, is a
veteran with a proven stomach for budget standoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And despite being in his last year as governor, Wilson is
provided with strong advantages by the state Constitution. It
requires a two-thirds vote in each house for the budget to be
passed, making it hard for the Democrats to peel off enough
Republicans to force the governor's hand, and it gives the governor
line-item veto power to punish legislators by cutting their pet
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart money is looking at late August now,'' said Dan
Schnur, a former top aide to Wilson who is a political consultant
in San Francisco. ``In the past, the choices have been so painful
that they led to paralysis. It takes two or three months to decide
whether you're going to take guide dogs away from blind people. But
there isn't any road map for what they're dealing with now.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Wilson said that it should not take so
long to reach agreement, but he added that he would not be
surprised if it did, noting that ``there doesn't seem to be even
common direction'' among the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And the governor dismissed any notion that the surplus is a
short-term phenomenon. Beginning two years ago, with the recovery
reaching full force, the state's revenue collections started
exceeding forecasts, and there was a somewhat smaller surplus last
year, though Wilson curtailed debate over how to spend it, by
unilaterally using most of it to replenish a state pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep having these nonrecurring surpluses,'' he said
sardonically, adding that this situation means ``California's tax
structure takes too big a bite.'' Wilson argues that the vehicle
tax, which costs the average car owner $185 a year, is particularly
onerous and affects almost everyone in a state with 24 million
registered vehicles, more than there are houses. His proposal would
save the average owner $135 a year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Twenty states impose no value-based taxes on motor vehicles,
opting for flat annual registration fees. But the 30 remaining
states impose either a personal-property tax on cars or, like
California, a value-based tax in lieu of property tax.
</P>
<P>
   In California's case, the car tax is the sole legacy of the
state's old personal-property tax, in which assessors visited homes
each year to survey the value of contents. But cars were always
mysteriously absent from driveways on assessment day, so in 1935
the state abandoned the personal-property tax in favor of a tax on
cars, imposed at annual registration.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures
found considerable support around the nation for rolling back such
taxes, after the successful candidacy for governor of James Gilmore
III in Virginia, who campaigned last year on a platform of reducing
that state's local property tax on automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, states including Kansas, Kentucky, Rhode Island,
South Carolina and Arizona have either passed reductions or are
considering them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tax is particularly disliked,'' said Mandy Rafool, a
conference policy analyst who conducted the study. ``People hate
property taxes in general, and this is a big chunk at once.''
</P>
<P>
   All the players here agree that there will be a tax cut, with
the only question being how big. Both sides are also proposing more
spending on education, with the Democrats demanding more than
Wilson has offered. But the governor repeated Tuesday that he was
``not interested in temporary relief'' from taxes and said that the
Legislature had so far offered no more than ``this little drill.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Burton _ an old Sacramento hand who is on his
second career after a stint here and in Congress collapsed as a
result of alcohol and drug abuse _ confessed in an interview, ``All
I want is to get out alive.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: `I'VE GOT TO DRIVE GUYS IN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Until a month ago, Juan Gonzalez had never heard of
Hack Wilson or of Wilson's major-league record of 190 runs batted
in. But for the Texas Rangers' slugger, it's now a magic name, a
magic number and a magic mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know about Hack Wilson now, I know about the record,'' he
was saying. ``It's not easy. It's not impossible too.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about runs batted in to Gonzalez and his eyes glow, his
smile widens, his mustache twitches. Other sluggers are home-run
hitters. He's an RBI man. It's as if RBI were his real initials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my job,'' he said. ``I've got to drive the guys in.''
</P>
<P>
   With 101 already this season as he batted cleanup for the
American League in Tuesday night's All-Star game, Gonzalez had the
second highest RBI total at the All-Star break to Hank Greenberg's
103 in 1935; the Tigers' first baseman finished with 170 that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of games remain,'' Gonzalez said, alluding to the
Rangers' resuming their season Thursday in Oakland, ``but I need to
see men on base.''
</P>
<P>
   Home run hitters sing solo, but RBI leaders need a chorus of
baserunners. Considering that Gonzalez has hit 26 homers, he has
already driven in the remarkable total of 75 teammates. In 1930
when Wilson had his 190 RBIs and hit 56 homers, still the National
League record, he drove in 134 teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to see home runs, they like to see the ball fly
away,'' Gonzalez said. ``But you have more chances for RBIs, the
guys on base are letting me do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Rangers' batting order, leadoff centerfielder Tom Goodwin
has scored 58 runs while batting .273, second baseman Mark McLemore
has scored 55 runs while batting .287 and left fielder Rusty Greer
has scored 55 runs while batting .280.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see them on base, I concentrate more,'' Gonzalez said.
``My adrenaline is more.''
</P>
<P>
   But until last Sunday night, the 28-year-old Puerto Rican hadn't
driven in a run in six games. He was stuck in neutral at 97 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shooting for 100 by the All-Star break,'' he said. ``I
didn't think I would get it, but then I had the best night in my
career and against one of the best pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   With a pair of two-run homers off Randy Johnson of the Mariners,
Gonzalez suddenly had 101 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``More RBIs than games played,'' he said, alluding to his 87
games. ``That's what you need to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez now needs 90 more RBIs in the Rangers' 76 remaining
games to break one of baseball's most enduring records that was set
by one of its most enigmatic sluggers. Hack Wilson isn't even in
the Hall of Fame. After five big years for the Cubs, and one more
for the Brooklyn Dodgers, he drifted away.
</P>
<P>
   As a 5-foot-6-inch 195-pound rookie outfielder with the New York
Giants in 1923, Lewis Wilson got his nickname because his physique
resembled that of a popular Russian wrestler, George Hackenschmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson didn't blossom as a slugger until he joined the Cubs in
1926, driving in 109 runs that year, then 129, 120 and 159 before
exploding with 190 in 1930 with those 56 homers and a .356 average.
That August he drove in 53 runs. He was the National League's
unofficial most valuable player that year.
</P>
<P>
   For each of his 56 homers, he received an Elgin watch. His
salary for 1931 was $33,000, lucrative for that era.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cubs manager, Joe McCarthy, was aware of Wilson's
reputation as a drinker. Wilson's lore includes the day that
McCarthy opened a gin bottle, dropped a worm in it and watched the
worm shrivel up.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the dead worm, McCarthy asked, ``What does this
prove, Hack?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It proves,'' Wilson supposedly said, ``that if you drink, you
won't get worms.''
</P>
<P>
   Traded after he skidded in 1931 to 13 homers and only 61 RBIs,
Wilson hit 23 homers and drove in 123 runs for the Dodgers in 1932
but that was his last big season. He died in 1948 at age 48 in a
Baltimore hospital. Ford Frick, then the National League president,
sent $350 to pay for Wilson's funeral in Baltimore and his burial
in Martinsburg, W. Va.
</P>
<P>
   Those 190 RBIs in 1930 have been Hack Wilson's monument, but now
Juan Gonzalez might approach it, if not surpass it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stop on Sept. 27,'' the Rangers' slugger said, alluding to
the last day of the season. ``Right now I have a chance.'' &QL;

ZIZOU READY FOR MATCH AGAINST CROATIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ Zizou went `zinzin'. Zinedine Zidane
couldn't stand still, couldn't keep quiet. He glanced at the TV
monitor, which kept showing Lolo Blanc's ``golden goal'' that beat
Paraguay in overtime and began laughing like a madman, running,
jumping, hugging anyone within reach. ``Zizou was completely in a
trance,'' testified goalkeeper Fabien Barthez.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Zidane had just been freed from one. For two weeks,
France's best soccer player had been banished for peevishly
stepping on a fallen Saudi rival and drawing a red card that put
him out of the next two matches.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 days, Zidane had been the ancient mariner of Les Bleus,
wearing a reeking albatross around his neck while his mates played
the World Cup without him, biting his knuckles on the bench and
praying that the tournament wouldn't end before his penance did.
</P>
<P>
   Came ``La Delivrance'' _ Blanc's goal in the 114th minute _ and
Zidane was a man redeemed, reborn. He was the man of the match in
last Friday's shootout victory over Italy, driving Les Bleus
forward for 120 minutes and nailing the first penalty kick. And if
France is to beat Croatia Wednesday night in the Stade de France
here and make the Cup final for the first time, Zizou will be the
man who leads them there.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane is what Michel Platini was to France's stylish but
ill-starred teams that also made the Cup semifinals in 1982 and
1986 _ their mainspring, their alchemist, their visionary. ``He's
the guiding light of the French team,'' says Italian forward
Alessandro Del Piero, who plays alongside Zidane for Juventus of
Turin.
</P>
<P>
   Without Zidane, Les Bleus were aimless, punchless, clueless
against Paraguay. With him, they were daring and confident against
Italy. They may have lacked for a finisher, but not a creator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he didn't score or produce the vital pass, we know
how important he is,'' says Italian defender Gianluca Pessotto, who
had to mark Zidane. ``I hope he wins the World Cup, because he
deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   His global rivals say the 26-year-old Zidane is the world's
second-best player after Brazil's Ronaldo and its best playmaker.
The French have already installed him in their pantheon alongside
Platini, with whom Zidane shares a number (10), a legacy _ and a
burden.
</P>
<P>
   When Zidane took the field against the Italians, a banner in the
stands proclaimed ``Zizou, t'es le roi (Zizou, you're the king)''.
``They expect a lot of me, and so do I,'' says Zidane. ``But that
doesn't bother me. I'm not a messiah _ just a player whose role is
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Zidane, who grew up in an Algerian neighborhood in the northern
part of Marseille, was still a boy wizard, a ``gamin'', when
Platini led France to the final four in 1986. The directors of
Septemes, his local club, kept telling Smail Zidane that his
youngest child ``Yaziz'' could play internationally some day.
Before long, recruiters from Marseille and Lyon and Cannes were
knocking on Zidane's door.
</P>
<P>
   The messiah business came later, after Zidane went off to master
his craft in Juventus's striped shirt (``That's where I learned to
win.''), after he took over France's midfield. Even then, Zidane
developed a reputation for disappearing in the big matches. Not so,
Zidane insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we lost, it wasn't that I wasn't good,'' he says. ``It
was either that there was a combination of circumstances or that we
were up against a better team. I believe the contrary _ that I'm
better when I'm playing for something important.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it killed Zidane to miss two matches just when Les
Bleus had dreams of at least getting to the Cup semifinals. Only a
hot-headed ``bobo'' would get himself chucked out of a match that
his mates were winning easily. Didier Deschamps, the French
captain, told Zidane so. ``It's his Mediterranean temper, which he
cannot always control,'' Deschamps said. ``In the heat of the
moment, I lost my temper with him.''
</P>
<P>
   So Zidane, ``disappointed and deflated'', went into an odd sort
of exile _ part cheerleader, part penitent, part spectator. He
trained with his mates, then sat on the bench in warmup gear and
watched them struggle without him to beat the Danes and win their
group.
</P>
<P>
   Then Zidane sweated blood as France and Paraguay stayed
scoreless for an eternity in their second-round match. ``It was
hard, even terrible,'' he said. ``To lose without being on the
field would have been awful. During the extra time, I felt an
impossible stress. I put myself behind my buddies, I wanted to help
them with little things, but they had to manage by themselves. The
longer it went, the more I suffered, up to the deliverance. Then, I
exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   Zizou went zinzin. ``He was the happiest of all of us,'' coach
Aime Jacquet said. He was Ebenezer Scrooge, come out of the
nightmare to find it was still Christmas Day. He embraced
midfielder Youri Djorkaeff, who'd shouldered his load, and thanked
him profoundly. ``The words will stay between us,'' Djorkaeff said,
``but they are unforgettable.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus was Zizou unchained. The Italy match, he vowed, would be
``le plus important de ma carriere''. He was Platini,
orchestrating, inspiring, pushing Les Bleus upfield. When it came
time for the shootout, Jacquet sent Zidane up first.
</P>
<P>
   When it was done, and Les Bleus had prevailed, 4-3, Platini (now
head of the Cup organizing committee), stood in the VIP box with
his arms up in a victory salute. ``I am not Platini,'' Zidane says,
``but having pressure on my shoulders gives me energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Zidane and Les Bleus go up against a country that didn't exist
the last time France played in a Mondiale. If they win, they'll
play in Sunday's final, with Jacques Chirac looking on and Zidane
the man carrying the dreams of la France. Chirac may be president
around here, but Zizou is le roi.

BANKBOSTON BEGINS SHEDDING JOBS   IN TRIMDOWN EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ BankBoston Corp. said Tuesday that it would shed 114
jobs, the first staffing cutbacks in a broad overhaul designed to
fine-tune operations, cut costs, and boost profits at New England's
second largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston's restructuring effort, which will last through 1999
and is likely to entail further layoffs, is not a grand remaking of
the bank's basic strategy. Rather, it is for now a collection of
nips and tucks across units ranging from retail and private banking
to small business and consumer lending. Future phases of the
restructuring initiative may affect the company's other core areas,
which include capital markets, corporate banking, and operations in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing was not a strategy review,'' said Thomas J.
Hollister, Bank Boston's executive vice president in charge of
consumer and small business lending.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said the effort, begun last fall but only now
being implemented, was aimed at making the bank more customer
focused by cutting down on paper handling and integrating the
bank's various service channels.
</P>
<P>
   Evoking on-line bookselling as a model of consumer-focused
service, a BankBoston memo to employees Tuesday said the company
would aim to know clients' needs better by collecting more
information about customers in a centralized fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial banks are fighting to win back market share from
financial services firms, whose arsenal of investment products pose
stiff competition. Banks, especially those in New England, also
face tighter profit margins from traditional branch banking. And as
increasing numbers of customers communicate with banks via personal
computers, telephones, and automated teller machines, banks are
racing to offer more products and services on line.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its restructuring, BankBoston also plans to set up
branches selling only a limited number of core products instead of
the traditional broad array of banking services. But in other
branches, the company will expand its offerings to include more
mutual funds and insurance products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to have a multichannel approach,'' BankBoston
president Henrique Meirelles said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cutbacks announced Tuesday affect BankBoston's
Providence, R.I. telephone banking unit, where 80 night-shift
employees will be given the opportunity to take day jobs, commute
to Dedham, Mass., or retire early.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, the nation's 16th-largest bank holding company, with
$71.4 billion in assets, has not said how much its restructuring
effort will cost or what kinds of savings will result. But both
numbers will run into at least the tens of millions, with savings
to be reinvested primarily in new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts have impressed Wall Street, which has put
BankBoston's share price in record territory lately, and industry
analysts, who are keen on the company's growth prospects and
management style. ``They are very enthusiastic about Internet
banking,'' said analyst Nancy A. Bush of Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. ``All of
the redesign indicates that they want to be a niche player'' in
retail banking.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston laid off 2,000 employees when it merged with BayBanks
Inc. in 1996, three years after crosstown rival Fleet Financial
Group Inc., the region's largest bank, slashed 3,000 jobs. Both
efforts boosted the bottom line but hurt morale and caused service
disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the size of future layoffs, Meirelles said,
``We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston shares rose 1/2 to close Tuesdayat 58 1/2, a record
high, on the New York Stock Exchange.

OPPOSITION CANDIDATE VOWS REFORMS IN MEXICAN STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The first governor elected from the leftist
Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) vowed Tuesday he would support
political reforms and an across-the-board attack on poverty in the
state of Zacatecas.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Monreal Avila, the PRD candidate in the central Mexican
state, told reporters at the party's national headquarters that he
would form a ``pluralistic and citizen-based'' government, and he
urged other elected officials to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   The ground-breaking victory came as the dominant Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) regained the governor's office in
Chihuahua state and retained its ascendancy in Durango in state
elections held Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Monreal quit the centrist PRI earlier this year to run on the
PRD slate in Zacatecas, although he has not yet technically joined
the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   He did not specify when he would formalize his association with
the party, but he said that when he signed onto the party's ticket,
he ``subscribed to the PRD's principles and that (he was) committed
to fulfilling them.''
</P>
<P>
   Amalia Garcia, a national senator and the PRD's secretary of
political relations, called the unusual alliance ``Monrealismo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He won, and we won,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD leader rejected suggestions that Monreal
opportunistically jumped ship when he encountered problems within
his former party and that the PRD took advantage of the former
federal deputy's home-state popularity to gain its first statehouse
since the party was founded in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Party founder Cuauhtemoc Cardenas became Mexico City's first
elected mayor in modern history during elections a year ago, when
the PRD also combined with the National Action Party (PAN) to break
the PRI's 70-year hold on the national Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the PRD feel that we won the election on Sunday, just as
we won last July 6,'' Garcia said. ``We have party militants here
who used to belong to the PRI, but now we are all in the PRD.''
</P>
<P>
   Monreal promised to build Zacatecas' industrial and tourism
bases, rebuild its educational system, and bring better health care
to the mining state's poor.
</P>
<P>
   A killing drought has devastated Zacatecas' agriculture, and
Monreal said he would design an emergency relief program to benefit
farmers and the state's urban poor.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised initiatives for referendums, plebiscites and
popular recall, as well constitutional reforms that would allow the
50 percent of the state's population now living in the United
States to vote in state elections.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD won 12 seats in the state legislature. The PRI also won
12 seats while PAN candidates took five.
</P>
<P>
   The victory of PRI candidate Patricio Martinez over the PAN's
Ramon Galindo in Chihuahua may signal a return to health in what
had been considered an ailing party.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing PAN Gov. Francisco Barrios was very popular, but under
Mexican law could not stand for re-election. Galindo was not
considered as strong a candidate as Martinez in Chihuahua, a state
that borders New Mexico and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI used a first-time open primary to select its candidates
in Chihuahua, something President Ernesto Zedillo has said he wants
to institute nationally to select the party's presidential
candidate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The loss reduces to five the number of statehouses held by PAN,
primarily in the country's conservative north, and is one more
setback after a dismal showing in the Mexico City mayoral election
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   PAN has long been considered Mexico's strongest opposition party
and it continues to rule most of Mexico's biggest cities.

 STOCK EXCHANGES IN LONDON, FRANKFURT ANNOUNCE ALLIANCE  (jw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In the clearest sign yet that national
boundaries are disappearing within European financial markets, the
stock exchanges of London and Frankfurt announced a broad alliance
Tuesday aimed at creating a pan-European trading system.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance between Europe's two biggest stock exchanges comes
as financial institutions across the continent are preparing for
the debut of the euro as a new European currency in January.
</P>
<P>
   It also highlights the growing pressure on London, which wants
to preserve its role as Europe's financial center even though
Britain will remain outside the new currency union for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
   The move Tuesday came just two weeks after Frankfurt's exchange,
the Deutsche Borse, disclosed that it was discussing potential
joint ventures with Nasdaq, the electronic over-the-counter trading
system in the United States. Executives are now looking at the
possibility of three-way discussions that would include Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, European stock exchanges have talked about alliances
many times before, without much to show for their efforts. The
Frankfurt, Zurich and Paris exchanges announced plans for an
alliance last fall, but they have yet to make much practical
progress. French and Swiss officials apparently knew nothing about
the talks between London and Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Under the latest agreement, the London Stock Exchange and the
Deutsche Borse plan to develop a joint electronic trading system
for blue-chip British and German stocks. But the ultimate goal is
to bring in other European stock exchanges and create a unified
electronic market for major stocks across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The move is ``the first step along the road to a single European
market,'' Jack Kemp-Welch, chairman of the London Stock Exchange,
said at a news conference in London.
</P>
<P>
   Though European stock prices have soared in the last year, the
markets remain fragmented and inefficient. Each European country
has at least one exchange, and few companies are traded in more
than one market. Trading volumes tend to be lower, because activity
is scattered among multiple exchanges that run on different rules,
different languages and different technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with 11 countries adopting the euro as a common currency on
Jan. 1, European financial institutions are rushing toward
consolidation. Under the rules of the European Monetary Union,
securities traded within the euro zone will be listed in euros
rather than national currencies on the first day of business next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, euro-land will have one or at best two
major financial centers,'' said Frank Beelitz, managing director of
Lehman Brothers' office in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, London's security exchanges had given every
impression of trying to compete on their own rather than team up
with other European exchanges. Though Britain is not adopting the
euro for the moment, London-based financial institutions have
prepared for euro-based trading and hope to benefit from a general
trend toward consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   The London and Frankfurt stock exchanges have until now viewed
each other as blood rivals, with each hoping to assume the leading
role in a unified European marketplace. At the moment, the London
Stock Exchange lists almost three times the number of companies
listed in Frankfurt. But the Frankfurt exchange generates more
trading volume, because it is home to the heavily traded stocks of
corporate giants like Daimler-Benz and Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   The Frankfurt exchange has made several big advances in the last
year or so. Its relatively young futures market has overtaken the
London futures exchange in several key areas. It has also had great
success with a new electronic trading system, called XTRA, which
now accounts for about two-thirds of the exchange's total trading.
That stands in contrast to the London exchange's new electronic
trading system, called SETS, which functions reasonably well but
has yet to generate heavy trading volumes from institutional
traders.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing their alliance, the two exchanges said they
planned to create a company that would eventually establish a
single electronic trading system for major stocks across Europe.
The first step, which exchange executives say will take about 12
months, is to harmonize rules and create common procedures for
buying stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of the alliance is to deliver a low-cost, efficient
and accessible equity market infrastructure,'' said Werner Seifert,
chief executive of the German stock exchange. Though the management
and technical details have yet to be decided _ and could turn into
big obstacles _ Seifert said the goal was to create the ``nucleus
of a single European stock market which will ultimately be based on
a common electronic trading platform.'' &QL;

CHAIN LAUNDRIES FRESHEN IMAGE, SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - Say goodbye to burnt-orange decor, walletloads of
quarters, poorly lit buildings and absentee owners who treat
coin-operated laundries like second jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Say hello to supergiant washing machines, debit cards that
provide flexible prices, round-the-clock attendants and national,
brand-name chains.
</P>
<P>
   The coin-operated laundry business is changing its dingy image.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies new to the Phoenix area, SpinCycle Inc. of
Scottsdale (Ariz.) and Super Wash of Phoenix, are introducing
innovation and pushing consolidation in this $3.5 billion industry.
Some even say these companies and other pioneers will bring to the
coin laundry industry the big-box format and nationwide uniformity
that Blockbuster Entertainment brought to the once independent
video-store business a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want a safe, secure, high level of customer service
place to do their laundry. And we're creating a national brand,''
said Peter Ax, chairman and chief executive officer of SpinCycle.
</P>
<P>
   A competitive attitude is heating up as both chains and the
Valley's independent operators target similar demographic groups _
densely populated neighborhoods with large families, high
percentages of renters and household incomes in the $25,000 to
$30,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   While they may steal market share from the competition, both
chains say they also create business from apartment dwellers fed up
with dark, dirty laundry rooms and from busy homeowners who want to
wash more in less time.
</P>
<P>
   National statistics also indicate healthy growth for the
business, according to the Downers Grove, Ill.-based Coin Laundry
Association. The percentages of renters is growing, more homeowners
are becoming aware of modern laundries' convenience, and
wash-dry-and-fold services are gaining popularity with dual-income
families, spokesman Brian Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   In just the past few years, the industry revolution has meant
several changes for consumers, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ More and bigger washing machines.
</P>
<P>
   SpinCycle stores offer a variety of washers for loads from 18 to
50 pounds. Super Wash goes them one better, with supergiant
machines that handle 75 pounds of laundry for $5.59.
</P>
<P>
   Both chains' stores have upper and lower rows of dryers, a
capacity-doubling innovation that Super Wash President Michael
Cutter says is less than 10 years old and ``one of the best
inventions in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Bigger, brighter, safer buildings.
</P>
<P>
   New stores can be as big as 5,500 square feet, more than double
the typical store size, the better to accommodate extra machines,
folding tables and seating.
</P>
<P>
   Bright interior lighting and plenty of big windows make store
activities visible to passers-by. Full-time attendants help people
with machines and keep an eye out for troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   - The budding use of ``smart cards,'' credit-card-size pieces of
plastic whose computer chips store a sum of money and deduct the
cost as a service is used.
</P>
<P>
   The cards make scrounging for quarters obsolete, budgeting for
laundry expenses manageable. Super Wash, first in the coin-laundry
industry to adopt smart-card technology, has put five of its 17
stores on the cards and has plans for more. Maytag distributor Coin
and Professional Equipment Co. of Phoenix recently installed
debit-card technology at two west-side laundries, President Dave
Svancara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest fears were customer acceptance and dependability,''
but customers quickly embraced the cards' safety and convenience,
Super Wash's Cutter said. One factor in his favor, he said, is that
many Hispanic customers were already familiar with the concept
because of prepaid phone cards widely used in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   _ Other marketing twists like free dryers and wash-dry-and-fold
service.
</P>
<P>
   Super Wash builds the price of drying into its wash price, then
advertises dryers as free to washer-using customers. Attendants and
paying customers enforce the policy, Cutter said.
</P>
<P>
   SpinCycle is introducing wash-and-fold service this month that
it hopes will bring in business from busy middle-income households,
traditionally light users of coin laundry services. The move also
will allow SpinCycle to put its stores and attendants to work on
light days and overnight, Ax said.
</P>
<P>
   Cutter, an ex-restaurateur whose family operated parking lots in
California, bought and sold his first laundries in Dallas in the
early '80s. He started building Super Wash 10 years ago when one of
his buyers defaulted and a business broker told him laundries in
Dallas were going for bargain-basement prices.
</P>
<P>
   Super Wash entered the Phoenix market three years ago, opened in
Las Vegas last fall and last month moved its headquarters to
Phoenix. Super Wash has had as many as 27 locations, but Cutter
sold the smaller ones and now has 17 stores, including seven around
the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   With 65 employees and projecting more than $3.5 million in
annual sales, Cutter says Super Wash is growing through
acquisitions financed through internal growth, bank loans and in
the future, private investors. Salt Lake City, Tucson and Reno are
its next possible markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   SpinCycle, by contrast, was born in 1995 when New York
investment banker Ax and Blockbuster veterans Patrick Clifton and
Christopher Lombardi decided to start their own company and
targeted the laundry business.
</P>
<P>
   They built their first store in Chicago in 1996 and, financed in
part by $50 million raised in three rounds of private equity, have
since built or acquired 110 stores stretching from Philadelphia and
Baltimore to Miami and Albuquerque. Its sole Arizona location, in
Tempe, opened just weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   SpinCycle recently completed a $100 million bond offering and,
as Ax said, ``we are positioned to continue to grow very rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   SpinCycle projects 200 stores, 1,200 employees and $40 million
in sales by year end, Ax said. It plans to enter 15 new markets in
1999 and look at Mexico and Latin America as international
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   SpinCycle would be ripe to go public in a year, Ax said. Cutter
says he isn't interested in selling Super Wash but will position
the company for a possible public offering, too.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are tapping technology to give them the cash
control and accountability unprecedented in the coin-operated
laundry business.
</P>
<P>
   Computer cards installed in each SpinCycle machine collect data
on how often a machine is used and how much cash collected. The
information is downloaded each night to SpinCycle headquarters,
where it is used to generate management reports and reconcile sums
with the amounts on-site attendants collected.
</P>
<P>
   Super Wash says its smart cards free attendants from having to
collect coins and repair jammed machines. They also allow the
company to change prices and offer bonuses. Super Wash cuts prices
40 percent between midnight and 6 a.m. to help drum up business at
an otherwise slow time, and it entices customers with offers of $22
worth of service for $20 cash, Cutter said.
</P>
<P>
   Super Wash sets prices so the cards never zero out, giving
customers incentive to come back to its stores, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to give people a reason to go elsewhere, unless
we're more expensive. And we're not, with the free dry,'' Cutter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Maytag distributor Svancara said the competition could even
benefit independent operators. When companies like SpinCycle offer
more service at higher prices, it could give the independents room
to raise their prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Blockbuster, could chains' growth drive out
competition?
</P>
<P>
   ``If stores aren't managed well, yes it would,'' he said. &QL;

The coin laundry business at a glance &QL; 
_ There are 35,000 coin-operated laundries in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are 30,000 owners of such laundries, meaning the
industry is dominated by individual owner-operators. The number of
multiple-store owners is growing, though most are limited by the
number of stores they can service in a geographic area.
</P>
<P>
   _ Laundries are capital-intensive to start, but they typically
have no inventory and no accounts receivable. They generally rent
retail space through leases lasting 10 to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Laundries can generate cash flow of $15,000 to $200,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>

were 89 million renters in the United States at the time of the
1990 census. &QL;

CONSUMER GROUP WARNS OF SKY-HIGH RESTOCKING FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rosemary Coronella bought a $2,800 computer for her daughter
last Christmas at Circuit City. When she couldn't get it to work,
she says, the retailer refused to refund her money, offered her a
store credit instead and slapped her with a $370 restocking fee.
</P>
<P>
   Coronella's predicament is apparently not unique. A report
issued Tuesday by the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group,
a consumer activist group, said a growing number of computer, auto
part and home supply retailers are imposing restocking fees ranging
from 5 to 30 percent of the original purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   The Masspirg survey also indicated many of those same retailers
are failing to comply with Massachusetts laws on returns. Deirdre
Cummings, legislative director for Masspirg, said 12 of 28
retailers surveyed violated at least one of two state laws. Eight
retailers failed to offer customers the option of a full refund in
the case of a defective product. Six failed to adequately post
their return policy or disclose the existence of a restocking fee.
</P>
<P>
   According to Masspirg, Circuit City violated both laws at its
Somerville, Mass. store. Its return policy was posted at the
returns counter but not disclosed to consumers prior to a purchase,
as the law requires. Circuit City also failed to give customers the
option of a full refund for defective goods, offering only to
repair the defective product, exchange it for a new one or issue a
store credit.
</P>
<P>
   Coronella, who bought her daughter's computer at the Circuit
City in Dedham, Mass., said it froze up repeatedly and support
technicians were unable to correct the problem. She said the
computer was such a nightmare that she decided to return the
product and collect a full refund.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I didn't ever want to go in that store again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said Circuit City offered her only a store credit and
also charged her a $370.50 restocking fee.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stewart, a spokesman for Circuit City in Richmond, Va.,
said the company allows customers to return computer products
within 14 days, sometimes longer at the store manager's discretion.
</P>
<P>
   If the customer wants a refund and the product has been opened,
he said, a 15 percent restocking fee is charged. (It was unclear
Tuesday why the restocking fee charged to Coronella was less than
15 percent.) If the customer merely wants to exchange the product
for another of equal or greater value, no restocking fee is
charged, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to protect our ability to offer low prices,''
Stewart said. ``It discourages abuses of our return policies. It
discourages customers who try to `rent' products.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also said restocking, or open box, fees are needed to
offset the cost of handling returned merchandise. He said retailers
cannot return opened computer equipment to the manufacturer and
have to mark down the price sharply to resell it. ``There's not
much profit to begin with on a computer product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why no restocking fee is charged when the customer
exchanges one product for another, Stewart said, ``Let's call it
consumerism.''
</P>
<P>
   Cummings of Masspirg said she believes the restocking fee is
being used by retailers to discourage customers from making
returns. She said she doubted there were significant actual costs
to restock the returned product.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a defective product, Stewart said Circuit City
gives a customer the option of having it repaired or replaced or
given a store credit. He said no restocking fee is charged in these
cases. Stewart was unable to explain why Coronella was issued a
store credit and a restocking fee, although he said it was possible
she had been given a credit on her credit card. Coronella said that
was not the case.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Masspirg charge that Circuit City's failure to offer
a full refund for defective merchandise violates Massachusetts law,
Stewart said he believes the retailer is in compliance with the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger's
office said Circuit City's interpretation of state law is
incorrect. A spokesman said the attorney general will review the
Masspirg results carefully.

FRENCH OUTRAGED OVER AMERICAN TALKS ON BUYING EIFFEL TOWER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Sell the Eiffel Tower to the Americans? Paris Mayor Jean
Tiberi was as outraged at the idea Tuesday as Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani might be at a suggestion that the Brooklyn Bridge was for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no risk to the ownership of this monument,'' Tiberi
assured fellow Gaullists in a stormy City Council meeting Tuesday
morning, after conservative renegades trying to unseat him spread
the alarm that a subsidiary of GMAC, the financial arm of the
General Motors Corp., was on the verge of acquiring operating
rights to the tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be inconceivable and unacceptable for the tower to
come under the control of an American group as its subsidiary,''
Philippe Dominati, another conservative, thundered as the renegades
cheered.
</P>
<P>
   GMAC Commercial Mortgage in Horsham, Pa., is indeed interested,
along with the Bass brothers of Texas, in buying a 70 percent
interest in the state-owned Credit Foncier de France. Credit
Foncier owns half of a management company that has a 70 percent
interest in the Eiffel Tower's operating company.
</P>
<P>
   According to French law, the tower is the ``inalienable''
property of the City of Paris, which means aliens of any kind,
including Americans, cannot buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine whoever is negotiating this for us on the
ground is aware of that,'' said Scott Rombach, GMAC Commercial
Mortgage's spokesman in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The 984-foot-high latticework tower, the highest in the world
when Gustave Eiffel designed it for a centennial exposition in
1889, attracts almost as many tourists as Notre Dame. Its
operations include a highly regarded restaurant, the Jules Verne,
on its second ``floor,'' and elevators that take tourists up to the
most thrilling view in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tower is not for sale, de Gaulle might have objected
to the sale of Credit Foncier itself, which may not be the Eiffel
Tower or the Arc de Triomphe but has serious credentials of its
own. It was founded by decree of Louis Napoleon and financed Baron
Georges-Eugene Haussmann's vast remaking of Paris in the late 19th
century, before entering the equally vast French market for
subsidized housing in the 20th.
</P>
<P>
   But after the property market went sour in the 1990s, Credit
Foncier lost $1.9 billion in 1996 and the conservative government
of the day let it be known that it was thinking of breaking it up
and selling it.
</P>
<P>
   Employees _ some of them civil servants who had been paid 16
monthly salaries a year, according to French accounts _ held the
bank's chairman hostage for a few days in January 1997 in protest,
and a few months later, voters threw out the conservatives and
elected a Socialist-led government, which continued to try to find
a buyer for Credit Foncier.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital, a subsidiary of General Electric Co., considered but
decided against a bid, and the bank's unions agitated for a sale to
the French post office. Now the question of whether the bank will
be sold to GMAC and the Bass group is up to the minister of the
economy, finance and industry, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who is
expected to make a decision later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Strauss-Kahn's office dismissed the whole matter as
political posturing by conservatives desperate to hold onto power
in the city but losing their grip after the mayor for nearly two
decades, Jacques Chirac, became president three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A leading possible Socialist candidate for the mayor's job in
the next election, in 2001, is Strauss-Kahn. &QL;

LUCY FINDS FREEDOM IN THE WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - It turns out the old cliche is true: You can look at
something for a long time and never see its true value, its real
worth.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of this recently by a story in another newspaper,
the ``Roanoke (Va.) Times.'' The story was about my niece, Lucy,
who was about to embark on a trip to Minneapolis for the USA
Swimming Disabilities Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy, 14, has McCune-Albright syndrome. It's remarkably rare _
the story said about 35 people in the United States are believed to
have it.
</P>
<P>
   Since she was 2, Lucy has been poked, prodded, operated on,
studied, stitched up and put into casts for cruel lengths of time:
time she spent lying on her back or stomach as the world went on
around her.
</P>
<P>
   I knew about the disease, of course, and I knew that Lucy was a
member of the local swim team.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen her swim, cruising along in the water in a smooth
manner that the disease doesn't allow her on land. Walking can be
tough for her; in the water, she's free.
</P>
<P>
   I also knew about the article. My sister told me a reporter was
going to interview Lucy, and she alerted me when the story appeared
on the ``Roanoke Times''' Web site, so I'd be sure to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you write about other people all the time, you
sometimes forget the impact what you're writing will have on their
lives. I'm not flattering myself here. It's just that I'll
occasionally receive a personal reminder of how powerful a medium
newspapers can be.
</P>
<P>
   The article about Lucy was one such reminder, and a happy one. I
clicked my way through several Web pages until I found the story,
written by a reporter named Neal Richards. The headline alone made
something catch in my throat:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Unsinkable Lucy Gilmore.''
</P>
<P>
   I read on:
</P>
<P>
   ``On June 26, Lucy Gilmore will compete on equal ground _ make
that in equal water _ for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards wrote about Lucy's experience in regular meets, how she
often came in last and how this never discouraged her. He recounted
the five surgeries on her right femur, using bone grafts from a
cadaver. He mentioned the spinal-fusion surgery, the operation to
remove bone cysts from her skull.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote about how Lucy qualified in six events for the
Minneapolis meet, about the effort she put into preparation, about
how she trained at 6 a.m. every day.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy is shy around strangers, but Richards coaxed a nice little
quote out of her, one that captured her feelings about the whole
experience:
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like to swim.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing new to me in this story. As I said, I knew
about the disease, the surgeries, the swim meets, the early-morning
practices (one friend noted that if she likes to get up at 6 a.m.
to practice, not much of my blood courses through her veins).
</P>
<P>
   Yet from those first four words _ ``the Unsinkable Lucy
Gilmore'' _ the story made me think of Lucy in a whole new way.
</P>
<P>
   Before, she was my niece. Courageous, sure. But still my niece,
one of the kids I snapped with a towel on family trips to the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because of the great job my sister and her husband
have done raising Lucy. She has chores, just like her three
sisters. When she doesn't do them, she's punished, like the others.
Nothing about her life suggests that she has ever been anything but
``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   I have never once heard Lucy utter the word ``handicap.'' I
doubt I ever will.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why I didn't see what was right in front of me all
this time _ that Lucy isn't just a courageous kid.
</P>
<P>
   She's downright inspirational.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy won five medals in Minneapolis and qualified for the
International Paralympic Committee World Championships in New
Zealand in October. She's competing at the world-class level.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she's still Lucy. She's still my niece. I'm still
going to snap her with a towel at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I'll still look at her the same way.
</P>
<P>
   I'll just see her a little differently. &QL;

POP LIFE: MORE CONCEPT, LESS MUSIC; HIP HOP BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dutch music duo of Arling and Cameron recently
had a brainstorm. They decided that their next album should be a
collection of music from films, television shows and movies that
don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   As Richard Cameron explains it, there will be themes for
``Hashie,'' about the exploits of a drug-sniffing version of
Lassie, and ``Shiva's Daughters,'' a ``Charlie's Angels'' with
Hindu deities.
</P>
<P>
   Such off-the-wall ideas, which merge retro kitsch with modern
imagination, are the staple of the music of Arling and Cameron, who
were recently in Los Angeles, looking for an American record deal
for the label they run, Drive-In.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, stateside interest in cocktail music and lounge
acts from the 1950s and '60s like Esquivel and Martin Denny, along
with a rise of new bands making similar music like Love Jones and
Combustible Edison, led some to predict kitschy soft-pop as the
next big thing.
</P>
<P>
   It never took hold in the United States, but at the same time an
international movement of similar (and more interesting) bands
began to coalesce in Europe and Asia as record collectors and disk
jockeys began trying to update their vintage pop, soundtracks and
exotica.
</P>
<P>
   In France, scores of lounge-pop acts including Air, Autour de
Lucie, Katerine, Etienne Charry and the Little Rabbits appeared. In
Germany, bands like Stereo Total, Maxwell Implosion and Le Hammond
Inferno took root. From Japan came groups like Pizzicato Five,
Cornelius and Fantastic Plastic Machine. From England, there was
the Gentle People, Adventures in Stereo and Momus. From Sweden
poured a flood of bands including the Cardigans, Eggstone and
Charlots.
</P>
<P>
   And from the Netherlands there was the upbeat, quirky duo of
Arling and Cameron, making music incorporating languages and
musicians from most of the other countries.
</P>
<P>
   On its latest CD, ``All In,'' and the forthcoming ``Sound
Shopping,'' Arling and Cameron combines easy-listening vibes,
strings and sound effects with house-music dance beats and vocal
snippets, usually pop phrases like ``yay,'' ``ba-ba-ba'' and
``la-la-la.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sound that's always happy,'' explained Gerry Arling, a
bassist trained in jazz. ``It's very difficult to sing a depressing
la-la-la.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron said he was never interested in dance and lounge music
until he began working as a bar-back to pay off recording studio
rental fees for a more traditional songwriting project. While he
was working there, a set designer approached him with the idea of
starting a band. ``He said his father used to be a Top-10 artist in
the '50s and was now a general in the army,'' Cameron said. ``And
the only reason he wanted to start the band was so he could get an
article about himself in a Dutch music magazine for fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Cameron was disillusioned with the record business and the
set designer didn't know the first thing about making music, they
decided to make a band in name only _ with no music. Three months
later, a Dutch music magazine wrote a feature on it. ``I'd been
making music for at least 10 years before that and I had at most
two lines in the magazines,'' Cameron said. ``And now I had a band
without music, and I had an article with a photograph. That's when
it dawned on me that pop was as much about the concept as the
music, especially dance music.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron helped start a series of dance parties called Popcorn,
and soon teamed up with Arling. As their first project together,
they put together a two-record set made up of 19 remixes of one
song. The wry pair called it ``Airbag: A Tribute to Safety,''
because they felt that the music took up a lot of room but had very
little content _ like an airbag. From their club experience, they
noticed that people would dance to nearly any style of music if
there was a house beat behind it, so they began making more diverse
music _ ``conceptual but not cynical,'' Arling insists.
</P>
<P>
   The duo's forthcoming single may be its most tongue-in-cheek
synthesis to date. The group appropriates the robot beats and
voices of Kraftwerk, a German group that has made a career of
embracing electronic instruments and detesting rock-and-roll. Only
the lyrics in Arling and Cameron's Kraftwerk song consist of a
computerized voice saying, ``We love to rock. R-O-C-K, let's
rock.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hip-Hop Battle
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest hip-hop battles of the year just got bigger.
Unlike some of the violent rap events of the last few years, this
fight has been taking place on vinyl. It began when the veteran
rapper L.L. Cool J insulted the up-and-coming rapper Canibus in a
song. Canibus recorded a song in response lashing out at L.L. Cool
J, ``Second Round K.O.,'' with vocal assistance from Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   In his next single, ``The Ripper Strikes Back,'' along with a
litany of Canibus insults, L.L. Cool J calls Canibus' manager and
mentor, Wyclef Jean of the Fugees, a ``Bob Marley impostor.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Jean, more a hip-hop syncretist than a purist, has entered
the fray. In ``What's Clef,'' which recently entered the
rhythm-and-blues radio play charts in Billboard, he seeks revenge
to the tune of Tina Turner's ``What's Love Got to Do With It.''
``I'm gonna push you back farther than your hairline recedes,''
Jean threatens L.L. Cool J in this single. To help him with the
insults, Jean recruited supermodel Naomi Campbell, who coos,
``L.L., why don't you just give up?''
</P>
<P>
   Though there's been no response from L.L. Cool J's camp yet, the
whole exchange has been exciting for hip-hop fans yearning for a
return to rap's more innocent days, when insults were answered with
rhymes instead of weapons.

STUDY DETAILS HEIGHTENED EFFECT OF NICOTINE IN BLACKS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   African-Americans take in as much as 30 percent more nicotine
than whites or Hispanics with every cigarette they smoke, report
scientists who say the reason may be a combination of the way
blacks smoke and their genes.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, the higher nicotine intake may explain why
blacks have more trouble quitting smoking and suffer from a higher
rate of lethal lung cancer, say the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   One of a pair of studies published in the current Journal of the
American Medical Association shows that blacks had higher levels of
a breakdown product of nicotine in their blood than did whites or
Hispanics. The study adjusted for the fact that blacks generally
smoke fewer cigarettes per day.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Ralph S. Caraballo of the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, interviewed 2,136 white, black and
Mexican American volunteers over 17 who had participated in
nationwide health and nutrition study called NHANES III betweeen
1988 and 1991. During the study, they had given blood samples that
were analyzed for levels of cotinin, a chemical formed when the
body metabolizes nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans turned out to have significantly higher
amounts of cotinin in their blood, indicating they had absorbed
more nicotine, even though they smoked the same number of
cigarettes as Hispanics and whites. One factor may be blacks' heavy
preference for mentholated cigarettes, which cool the throat and
make it possible to inhale more deeply, but the CDC scientists said
this didn't entirely account for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   While they couldn't fully explain that difference, the
scientists said the finding of higher cotinin levels in blacks is
important, because black smokers are more likely to try to quit
smoking but have less success, and blacks are at higher risk of
developing and dying from lung cancer. The difficulty quitting
could be the result of taking in more nicotine per cigarette, and
the higher cancer rate may stem from black smokers' inhaling more
cancer-causing ``tars,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that blacks suffer more from the health risks of
smoking because their bodies don't clear out nicotine and
carcinogens as fast as other ethnic groups, said the scientists.
Other racial differences in metabolizing drugs and carcinogens have
been found previously, but not for nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, scientists at San Francisco General Hospital
reported that blacks do metabolize cotinin more slowly than whites
or Hispanics. This may mean that blacks metabolize carcinogenic
substances more slowly, making them more prone to cancer, said the
researchers. The study, however, did not find a difference in
metabolism of nicotine itself. The tests did show that black
smokers took in 30 percent more nicotine than whites, said Drs.
Eliseo J. Perez-Stable and Neal L. Benowitz.
</P>
<P>
   As in the other study, the reason wasn't clear. But, Benowitz
said, ``almost all blacks smoke menthol cigarettes, which have a
cooling effect allowing deeper inhalation; but it could also be
that blacks in general are poorer, and if you have less money you
may smoke each cigarette more intensely.''
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial in the journal, Dr. Edward M. Sellers of the
University of Toronto pointed out that there are differences among
racial and ethnic groups in how they react to tobacco smoke. More
than 50 percent of Japanese men smoke, but they have some of the
lowest rates of lung cancer, said Sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers's own research has shown that some people have mutations
in a metabolic gene that make them less likely to become hooked on
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists noted that tobacco companies have targeted
advertising for menthol cigarettes at the black community. And
Gregory Connolly, director of the Massachusetts Tobacco Control
Program, said ``the tobacco industry has designed brands
specifically for blacks that allow greater efficiency of extraction
of nicotine.

THE PRESSURE IS ON THE HOME TEAM, BUT THERE ARE ADVANTAGES AS
WELL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CLAIREFONTAINE, France _ Never has France played a soccer match
as eagerly anticipated or as vitally important as the one it will
play Wednesday night against Croatia in the semifinals of the World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Three times previously France has advanced to the semifinals,
but each time it has gone away unfulfilled. There is more at stake
now.
</P>
<P>
   France, once an indifferent host of the 1998 World Cup, has
united its screaming, horn-honking, flag-waving passion behind Les
Bleus. Anything less than a victory would cause national
heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   As the home team, France has all the pressure, but also many of
the advantages. It will play Croatia before loyal fans at the
80,000-seat Stade de France in Saint-Denis. And if they win, Les
Bleus will return to the stadium for Sunday's championship game.
The home team has not won the World Cup since Argentina in 1978,
but as the French captain, Didier Deschamps, said Tuesday at the
national training center, ``I feel the opportunity to do something
historic.''
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned against looking too far ahead, because the
semifinals have always been a blind curve for France. In 1958,
17-year-old Pele scored a hat trick as Brazil ousted France, 5-2,
leaving the overwhelmed French goalkeeper, Claude Abbes, to say,
``I'd rather play against 10 Germans than one Brazilian.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have wanted to retract that statement after the throbbing
1982 semifinal when France lost Patrick Battiston, and a couple of
Battiston's teeth, on a vicious body block by the German goalie
Toni Schumacher, who was somehow not ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Platini's French team still managed a 3-1 lead in
overtime but lost its composure and the match as Germany tied the
score, then won on penalty kicks. The teams met again in the 1986
semifinals and again France lost, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   A third semifinal meeting with Germany was averted when Croatia
stunned the three-time world champions by 3-0 in the quarterfinals.
A French nation that hardly seemed to care about the World Cup is
now draped in the flag. Soccer is chic. Didier called the fan
support unexpected and inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Aime Jacquet, the French coach, is letting his bitterness seep
out like air from a tire. Heavily criticized at one time by fans
and the news media for the team's emphasis on defense, his
perceived weaknesses are now considered strengths. But he seems to
feel that the newfound praise is both overdue and hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy, because the people were misinformed about the
team,'' Jacquet said Tuesday, barely hiding his contempt for French
reporters. ``They thought we had no French team, no system in
place. They wondered if there was a coach. Now the public is
happily surprised, and we are happily surprised at the public
support.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be more expectation than anxiety among French
fans and players about this match, and the home team can find great
security in its defensive wall of Lilian Thuram, Bixente Lizarazu,
Laurent Blanc and Marcel Desailly, which has not been breached,
except by penalty kicks, in five matches. But there is concern
among the French about tired legs and imprecise feet.
</P>
<P>
   France has extended itself into overtime and into penalty kicks,
respectively, in its last two matches. The team doctor has said he
is concerned about fatigue. And scoring goals has become rare and
troublesome. After nine goals its first three games, all the French
have to show in the last two matches are a goal by Blanc in
overtime against Paraguay and a penalty-kick escape after a
scoreless afternoon against Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The players and coaches have fumbled for reasons to explain the
drought. Perhaps they are trying too hard to be perfect. Perhaps it
is the reticent French mentality. Perhaps it is a lack of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The midfielder Youri Djorkaeff has prepared an encouraging
videotape of scoring chances for his teammates. And he has vowed,
like Babe Ruth pointing to the home run fence, to put the ball in
the net against Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't get blocked on this issue,'' Deschamps said
Tuesday. ``We have been creating opportunities. We should be
concerned if the opportunities weren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacquet has choices to make. Does he pack the midfield again, as
he did against Italy, or does he employ two strikers? Does he stick
with Stephane Guivarch, who lead the French League in scoring but
who is 0-for-the World Cup? Does he start the fleet winger Thierry
Henry, who scored two goals against Saudi Arabia?
</P>
<P>
   Croatia seemed vulnerable on the flanks until Germany had a
player ejected. But Croatia is a confident team with an urgent
sense of destiny and nationalism in its first World Cup. It is a
chippy team, too, and the French playmaker Zinedine Zidane must be
careful not to lose his cool as he did in the first round, which
cost him a two-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   This French team wants to go farther than previous French teams,
Desailly said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, we cannot stop in the semifinals,'' Jacquet said. &QL;

PAKISTANI OFFICIAL ASSAILS INDIA ON ATOMIC WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A senior Pakistani official said Tuesday that India
was using a fictional threat from China and unverified charges of
Pakistani terrorist infiltration into Kashmir to justify its
nuclear weapons program and revive threats against Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say that to verify these charges, let neutral international
observers be stationed on both sides,'' said the official, Foreign
Secretary Shamshad Ahmad, in a speech to the Asia Society in New
York. ``India has always refused.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad said India never made available to Pakistan names or other
information about infiltrators New Delhi said it had captured in
connection with the planning or execution of attacks in Kashmir, a
Muslim-majority territory that is considered a flashpoint for war
between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, India shocked the United Nations by refusing to meet
with a representative of Secretary-General Kofi Annan who was sent
to the region to offer U.N. help in cooling tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The envoy, Assistant Secretary-General Alvaro de Soto, was
welcomed in Pakistan and also visited Sri Lanka _ though India,
which monitors the foreign policies of its smaller neighbors, asked
the Sri Lankans not to receive him at a high level, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad said that India's boast of having ``a big bomb,'' its
numerous nuclear and missile tests, its acquisition from Russia and
elsewhere of billions of dollars in new military equipment, its
threat to seize Pakistan's portion of Kashmir, and its plans to
build temples on the ruins of mosques have cost it international
standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facade of an India upholding universal values has finally
been lifted,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Ahmad, who has just met with U.S. officials in Washington,
echoed comments Indians have made on trips to the United States
when they criticize the government and the Congress for focusing
too much on the issue of nuclear weapons and not enough on the
regional security concerns of South Asians.
</P>
<P>
   He said that giving in to repeated demands to relinquish the
nuclear option would be tantamount to ``forfeiting our right to
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars in 50 years, one of
which broke apart Pakistan, creating Bangladesh, and Pakistan is
afraid of losing more territory.
</P>
<P>
   In the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir recently, armed groups
have attacked Hindu communities, inflaming public opinion in New
Delhi, where a Hindu nationalist government is in power.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmiri-American leaders say that at least some of these
attacks were carried out by Indian-sponsored counterterrorists with
the intention of discrediting Kashmiri separatists and giving the
Indian government excuses to increase repression in the Kashmir
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian home minister and officer in charge of the Kashmir
issue, Lal Krishna Advani, has made a series of threatening
statements based on such events, which Pakistanis have interpreted
as laying the ground for possible attacks across the disputed
border. Advani is on record as saying that India should recover the
parts of the region under Pakistani control.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Kashmir has been occupied by India and one-third
by Pakistan since the two nations gained independence in 1947 and
the future of the territory was left unresolved by Britain. India
has refused to allow a U.N. plebiscite to take place among the
Kashmiris.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad said Tuesday that Pakistan would not agree to making the
cease-fire line between Indian and Pakistani troops in Kashmir an
international border, as some diplomats have suggested as a first
step toward reducing tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would violate U.N. Security Council resolutions calling
for a free and fair plebiscite,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad did not respond directly to repeated Indian hints that New
Delhi might agree to sign the international Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty at some point, as the five permanent members of the Security
Council have urged. But he said that the possibility of Pakistan's
signing before India _ a break with a longstanding policy of
waiting for New Delhi to act first _ was being discussed ``at all
levels'' in the Pakistani government.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech largely devoted to Pakistan's history of living in
the shadow of a better-armed India and the rebuffs Pakistanis have
received to all proposals for regional disarmament, Ahmad said that
his Islamic country now faces an Indian party ``whose actions the
prime minister justifies in Parliament on the basis of Hindu
mythology.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad said that Pakistan had little faith in bilateral talks
between the two nations, which the United States and other nations
are encouraging, because they have never solved fundamental
problems.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that earlier U.S. sanctions, which had crippled
Pakistan's conventional defense systems before the latest round of
sanctions began to weaken the country's economy, left no option but
nuclear development. &QL;

COMMENTARY: MILLI VANILLI NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're a star, you can get away with _ well, if not murder,
then at least with accusing other people falsely of murder.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message handed down by CNN as it retracted its
``insupportable'' story about American servicemen using nerve gas
in Laos in 1970. Two TV news producers were instantly terminated; a
third fell on her sword; but Peter Arnett, the star correspondent
who actually delivered the report on the air, and who received a
Time byline as co-author of its print incarnation, escaped with a
reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   That escape may be short-lived, since CNN's support of Arnett
seems to be waning by the hour. But whatever his fate, his starring
role in this fiasco is at the heart of what went wrong. When news
becomes just another flavor of show business, Hollywood values
overrun those of journalism. Box office, hype and star power trump
facts.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly was Arnett's role in the nerve-gas story? Last week
he told The New York Times that he ``was essentially brought in
late,'' then ``asked a few questions'' and ``read the script.'' In
Tuesday's Washington Post, he said he had ``contributed not one
comma.'' A few questions, not one comma, whatever. A CNN executive
told me Monday that the network was still seeking to determine
Arnett's precise contribution.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he only ``read the script'' on camera _ lending his
face, voice, prestige and Pulitzer Prize-winning credibility to its
words _ does that absolve him of responsibility for its contents,
like an emcee on a quiz show? Is he really still a journalist, or
does he just play one on TV? And if he just plays one, does that
mean TV news stars should be less accountable for what they lip
sync than Milli Vanilli?
</P>
<P>
   And if Arnett ``contributed not one comma'' to CNN's version,
why did he get a co-byline in Time, CNN's partner at Time Warner,
for its 2,000-word rendition of it? (By contrast, one of the
dismissed CNN producers had only an ``additional reporting'' tag
line in Time.) Arnett's explanation is ``marketing reasons.'' His
marquee name, not to mention the sensationalism of the story he
lent his name to, would help sell the premiere episode of a new
prime-time series conceived in synergy by two news organizations
now joined in unholy matrimony by one mega-brand.
</P>
<P>
   Time will not soon again lend its pages so cavalierly to a Time
Warner sibling, and CNN will not soon air another half-baked
bombshell. Their respective, forthright mea culpas are being
followed by the installation of a new system of journalistic checks
and balances. But as the final heads roll and the story recedes,
the culture that caused it remains entrenched _ and ubiquitous.
It's the same entertainment culture, with its insatiable hunger for
new stars and daily scoops (however tenuous), that has contributed
to many of our recent media messes _ from the Monica meltdown to
the editorial suspension of disbelief that allowed popular writers
to repeatedly pass off fiction as fact at The Boston Globe (owned
by The New York Times Co.) and The New Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, few in the media want to concede a systemic problem
exists _ unless it's at someone else's shop. The smug industry
response to Brill's Content would have one believe that no one has
made a single mistake covering the Lewinsky story _ except Steven
Brill. The CNN-Time botch seems to have only thickened the
prevailing arrogance. The New York Post's John Podhoretz, appearing
on ``Crossfire'' to bash CNN, had a temper tantrum and fled from
the studio in mid-show last Thursday when questioned about the
Post's own brand of Murdoch journalism. On ABC's ``This Week'' on
Sunday, Cokie Roberts carefully segregated the CNN-Time fiasco from
any other journalistic disasters because it besmirched the military
and therefore might be construed as ``anti-American.'' By this
logic, her show is also anti-American, since in January it
besmirched the presidency by airing the still-unsupported story
that ``Secret Service agents or White House staff'' caught
President Clinton ``in an intimate encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that no network is anti-American; they're just
pro-ratings. And there's nothing wrong with high ratings for TV

ISRAELIS ANTICIPATE PALESTINIAN DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ With every day that passes without movement toward
an Israeli-Palestinian settlement, the probability grows that in 10
months' time, probably on May 4, Yasser Arafat will declare a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what that would mean, nobody knows. But Arafat has
pledged several times to do so, and a growing number of Israeli
academics and commentators regard the prospect of such a
proclamation as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Arafat's
Palestinian Authority have deteriorated to such a degree, some
experts say, that even if the United States can pull off a further
Israeli withdrawal and get talks going, chances are that they would
soon collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there is the second redeployment and there is an
attempt to begin final-status talks,'' said Joseph Alpher, head of
the Jerusalem office of the American Jewish Committee and an expert
on strategic affairs, ``given the gap in concept regarding land,
the nature of sovereignty and the confidence and credibility gap, I
see no chance whatsoever that they'd make enough progress to
justify postponing what Arafat intends to do.''
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli think tank recently ran a simulation of what would
happen if a state was proclaimed, the biweekly newsmagazine
Jerusalem Report dedicated its current cover story to the matter
and the mass-circulation Yediot Ahronot recently published a
detailed and chilling scenario based on interviews with security
officials and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Under the hypothetical outline, the Palestinian declaration of
independence would lead to an eruption of bloodshed, and the United
States would decide not to stand alone in the United Nations
against the recognition of the new state.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, the Israeli government perceives the
upgrading of the status of the Palestine Liberation Organization
observer delegation at the United Nations on Tuesday as a test run
for eventual full membership. The PLO will remain an observer, but
with the added right to take part in the General Assembly debates
and co-sponsor resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government condemned the PLO's application for a
higher status as a ``very gross and substantial violation'' of the
Oslo peace accords and campaigned fiercely against it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the U.S. efforts to persuade Netanyahu to make the
territorial concession required to restart negotiations evidently
stalled, and mutual recriminations between Israel and the
Palestinians reaching vitriolic levels, the growing expectation
among those who monitor the process is that Arafat _ ailing at 68
and politically weakened _ will have no choice but to proclaim the
state that has been his goal for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat needs to come to his people after five years of interim
agreement with some substantial thing in his hand, which might push
him to the declaration,'' said Ron Pundak, an Israeli historian and
one of the academics whose secret meetings with the PLO laid the
groundwork for the Oslo agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Using Netanyahu's nickname, Pundak added: ``Though I believe
Arafat himself prefers to achieve statehood through negotiations,
the gap between him and Bibi is huge. It's impossible to bridge.
The pressure on him is severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's justification for setting May 4 as the deadline is that
the day marks the end of the five-year transitional period
stipulated in the Oslo accords, which began when Israel and the PLO
signed the agreement in Cairo on May 4, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   What the Oslo timetable refers to as final-status talks were to
have begun in May 1996 and were to be concluded by May 1999. A
formal opening session was actually held in 1996, but later that
May, Netanyahu was elected prime minister, and talks gradually
ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oslo set a maximum time for reaching an agreement,'' said
Nabil Shaath, a senior official of the Palestinian Authority.
``This was the maximum time _ not the minimum, not the average _
after which the interim period falls on its face.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this happens, the status of the territories, whether it
becomes an independent state or something else, is not really a
matter of negotiations. It's entirely a matter for Palestinians to
decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Israelis, of course, disagree vehemently. ``Obviously the
declaration of a state would be the scuttling of the Oslo
agreement, and we would do whatever we found necessary to protect
Israel from whatever threat would be posed by a Palestinian
state,'' said David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's director of
communications. ``The first thing we would do is to try to dissuade
the nations of the world from recognizing the state that came into
being without negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument that a unilateral declaration of a state violates
the Oslo accords, or veiled threats from Netanyahu, would probably
not dissuade Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   More than likely, his state would be quickly recognized not only
by traditional supporters in the Middle East and the third world,
but also by Europe, which has been increasingly critical of
Netanyahu's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Though Washington has tried to steer Arafat away from a
unilateral declaration, the statement supporting Palestinian
statehood made by Hillary Rodham Clinton in January has been taken
by Palestinians and Israelis alike as a reflection of White House
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   The next question is what would a declaration of statehood mean.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority has full control over most of the Gaza
Strip and about 3 percent of the West Bank, and another 27 percent
of the West Bank is under joint Palestinian-Israeli control. If
Netanyahu agrees to the further withdrawal demanded by Washington,
another 13 percent would come under partial Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has told visitors that he will declare sovereignty only
over territory he controls, but whether that includes the areas of
shared control is unclear. It is also unclear whether he would
claim all the land conquered by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli
war, including East Jerusalem, as occupied territory belonging to
his state.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of an Israeli response. The
government would come under immediate pressure to protect Jewish
settlements in the Gaza Strip and outlying areas of the West Bank,
requiring considerable movement of troops into Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that the government would also be
tempted to annex all territories not under Arafat's full control,
or even to reconquer the Palestinian towns already turned over to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Any such move by either side would be heavy with potential for
violence. Only last week, a dispute over a blocked road in the Gaza
Strip led to a 15-hour standoff, with Israeli troops and
Palestinian police officers taking aim at each other over earthen
fortifications.
</P>
<P>
   And if violence does erupt, all that is certain is that each
side will blame the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to seek to negotiate,'' Shaath said. ``The
only way this will lead to conflict is if Netanyahu decides to
continue to act as occupier. The decision on confrontation is
really up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bar-Illan said: ``We'd have to protect ourselves. How, I'd
rather not talk about at this point. There have been many
suggestions, like annexing those areas, but this is not from the
prime minister's office, which at this time prefers to keep it as
abstract as possible.'' &QL;

TYSON DELAYS PETITION FOR NEW NEVADA LICENSE
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Tyson is eligible to apply to the Nevada State Athletic
Commission on Thursday for re-instatement of his boxing license,
but the commission hasn't heard from him. Shelly Finkel, the boxing
manager who is advising Tyson, said it would be two weeks before
Tyson, the former heavyweight champion, petitions the commission to
return his license.
</P>
<P>
   And even after that, it will be another two to three weeks
before the commission schedules a hearing, according to a
commission spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Finkel said that nothing would be submitted on Tyson's behalf
this week. ``We're going over all the options right now,'' Finkel
said. ``We'll make our appeal when we're done with that.'' He said
he could not comment on the options.
</P>
<P>
   When Tyson was suspended last July 9 for biting off a piece of
the right ear of Evander Holyfield during their heavyweight title
bout on June 28, his license was revoked indefinitely. There are no
guarantees that even if Tyson does re-apply that he will be granted
his license to box again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson fired his co-managers John Horne and Rory Holloway and
sued them, and also sued promoter Don King for $100 million,
alleging breach of contract and fraud, and is seeking to get out of
his contract with King on that basis.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is now being advised by entertainment executive Jeff Wald,
entertainment attorney John Branca, both based in the Los Angeles
area, and Finkel. Other than a World Wrestling Federation
pay-per-view event, Tyson has kept a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has really made over his behavior in the last year,''
Finkel said. ``And he has done things that will be favorable to his
getting his license back. He's working out. He's been doing some
charity work. He's a changed person. He has really gotten a lot
more at peace with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   JONES GOES PUBLIC
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roy Jones Jr. and Lou Del Valle, who will meet at The
Theater in Madison Square Garden on July 18 in a light heavyweight
title bout, will conduct public workouts at 12:30 p.m. Thursday at
Bryant Park in Manhattan. Jones and Del Valle were once sparring
partners, but they won't be going at it against each other during
the public workout.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kelley of Flushing, Queens, will fight Derrick ``Smoke''
Gainer on the undercard. It will be the second time in a year that
Kelley, who was one of the Garden's house fighters, will get second
billing on a card at the arena. In December, Kelley fought Prince
Naseem Hamed at Madison Square Garden _ losing on a fourth-round
knockout _ but it was Hamed's American debut and HBO had spent $1
million marketing him to the public here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to the point where fighting at the Garden doesn't
even feel like a homecoming to me,'' Kelley said. ``I don't care.
It doesn't matter. My people will be there for me. I'm a fighter.
I'd fight this guy in a bathroom if I had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, with one eye closed from too many punches, knocked out
Gainer in the eighth round in their first fight.
</P>
<P>
   AKINWANDE STILL CONTAGIOUS
</P>
<P>
   The latest blood test conducted on heavyweight Henry Akinwande
shows that he is still positive for hepatitis B, the contagious
disease that postponed his June 6 bout against Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Akinwande is awaiting another round of tests that might show he
is less contagious. That still might not be enough to persuade the
New York State Athletic Commission to give its approval for a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   The fight might be moved to Nevada, which doesn't test for
hepatitis B, but then Holyfield and his doctors would have to be
satisfied that Akinwande isn't still contagious. &QL;

APPEALS COURT RULES SECRET SERVICE AGENTS MUST TESTIFY IN CLINTON
INVESTIGATION  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court Tuesday dealt a setback to
President Clinton and his protectors, ruling that Secret Service
agents must testify before a grand jury investigating allegations
of a presidential affair and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   In a victory for special counsel Kenneth Starr, the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Washington rejected the government's argument
that Secret Service agents could not be compelled to tell about the
content of private presidential conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel, in a decision that could be appealed to
the Supreme Court, ruled the Secret Service has no ``protective
privilege'' from testifying. The government had contended that
presidents would shun the protective detail _ and, therefore, risk
their lives _ if the agents could be ordered to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have ... doubts about both the need for and efficacy of the
proposed privilege,'' the panel wrote in an opinion none of the
judges signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the need, the greatest danger to the president arises
when he is in public, yet the privilege presumably would have its
greatest effect when he is in the White House or in private
meetings ...
</P>
<P>
   ``As for efficacy, we suspect conscience might impel a president
to distance himself from Secret Service agents when engaging in
wrongful conduct, as might a simple desire for privacy at other
times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and Secret Service issued a joint
statement saying they were ``disappointed'' by the court's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be concerned that any action that could
distance the Secret Service from the president increases the danger
to his life and that of future presidents,'' the statement said.
``We are reviewing whether to appeal and hope to have a decision
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruling upheld U.S. District Court Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson's order that Secret Service agents Gary Byrne and
Brian Henderson and agency attorney John Kelleher answer questions
before a federal grand jury investigating whether Clinton engaged
in a cover-up of alleged sexual indiscretions with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the former White House intern have denied under oath
that they had sex, but Lewinsky reportedly admits to such a
relationship in phone conversations taped by co-worker Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said he was ``gratified'' by the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fundamental in our country that all law-enforcement
officers cooperate fully in responding to requests for relevant
information in a federal grand jury investigation,'' he said. ``The
court of appeals today reaffirmed that bedrock principle,
emphasizing that the rule of law is not incompatible with the
profound national interest in protecting the life of the
president.``
</P>
<P>
   As part of his case, Starr wants to show that Clinton and
Lewinsky met alone at the White House, and the independent counsel
has asserted that Secret Service agents have information to support
that contention.
</P>
<P>
   Starr argued that if the Secret Service needed an exemption from
testifying in criminal cases, the agency should ask Congress to
pass a law and not seek a court ruling for which there is no
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court agreed and took the Secret Service to task for
asserting the need to protect the president's confidential
communications while refusing to require its agents to sign
confidentiality agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, a former agent who is not bound by any agreement or
rule will suffer no adverse consequences by cooperating in an
investigation of the president; second, the secretary of the
Treasury, who heads the Secret Service, has no way of knowing when
such a cooperative former agent is about to testify,'' the court
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If preventing testimony is as critical to the success of its
mission as the Secret Service now claims, it seems anomalous that
the service has no better mechanism in place to discourage former
agents from revealing confidences.''
</P>
<P>
   The three judges, all Republican appointees, are Douglas H.
Ginsburg, A. Raymond Randolph and Stephen F. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruling came as Tripp returned for a third day
before Starr's grand jury. But she may soon be facing legal trouble
of her own.
</P>
<P>
   As Tripp continued her testimony for Starr, a Howard County,
Md., grand jury began to probe whether she violated state law when
she secretly recorded her conversations with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland's wiretapping law prohibits people from recording
conversations without the other person's knowledge. However,
prosecutors must show that the person doing the taping showed a
reckless disregard for or intended to break the law.
</P>
<P>
   This might allow Tripp to avoid culpability by showing she did
not know she was violating the law.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp called Maryland State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli's
convening of the grand jury ``the latest in a series of attempts to
intimidate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying she is ``not intimidated in any way,'' Tripp pledged to
``continue to testify truthfully and completely.''

TWO BORDER PATROL AGENTS SHOT DEAD IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER and JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BENITO, Texas _ Two U.S. Border Patrol agents were ambushed
and killed early Tuesday while helping local authorities
investigate a fatal shooting near this South Texas city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspect came out of the cornfield and literally ambushed
my agents. All indications are they never had a chance to use their
guns,'' said Joe Garza, the Border Patrol chief in McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   The dead agents were identified as Ricardo Guillermo Salinas,
24, of San Antonio, who graduated from the Border Patrol Academy in
January, and Susan L. Rodriguez, 28, of Harlingen, daughter of a
retired Border Patrol deputy chief.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Rodriguez, who was a training officer, nor Salinas, who
was nearing the end of his probationary period, had drawn a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   A suspect in the killings of the federal agents and of the
earlier shooting deaths of a mother and her daughter in nearby Rio
Hondo was in a Harlingen hospital. Hospital officials identified
him as Ernest Moore, 24, of San Benito, and said he was being
treated for several gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was shot several times in an exchange of gunfire with law
enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of officers continued to search Tuesday night for at
least one other suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``These killers will be found,'' said Doris Meissner,
commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which
oversees the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deaths of these fine young people cannot go unpunished. We
will do everything in our power to see that the person or persons
responsible for this tragedy are swiftly brought to justice,'' said
Meissner, who flew to Texas after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The two civilians killed in Rio Hondo, a small community
northeast of Harlingen, were identified as Dalia Morin, 31, and her
mother, Margarita Flores, 52.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron County Sheriff's Deputy Raul Rodriguez and Dan Morin,
22, were wounded in Rio Hondo. They were being treated at Valley
Baptist Medical Center for gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the bloody sequence of events began shortly
after 5 a.m. when Dalia and Dan Morin and Flores were shot at a
house in Rio Hondo.
</P>
<P>
   The police responded and put out an alert for a white pickup
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez spotted the truck, gave chase, lost it and radioed for
assistance. Rodriguez and three Border Patrol agents later found
the truck outside Moore's home south of San Benito.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio, the four were
about to search the adjacent area when they were attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stepped out of the cornfield and cut them down,'' Lucio
said of the suspected gunman.
</P>
<P>
   The third Border Patrol agent involved had not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first killing of a Border Patrol agent in Texas since
1996. Rodriguez was the first woman agent killed on active duty.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio said authorities were looking for one or two additional
people who were spotted with Moore after the Rio Hondo shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to mention any suspects yet because we want to
make sure we have an airtight case,'' the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Lopez, 15, who lives near the Moore residence, awoke to
the sound of gunshots Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real rapid. It was like it wouldn't stop,'' said Lopez,
who said a steady stream of police cars, followed by aircraft,
responded to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Gonzalez, chief of the four-man Rio Hondo Police
Department, said the victims of the shooting apparently did not
know their assailant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he is an ex-boyfriend of one of the people staying
at the residence. She may have been a guest of theirs, but at this
time we cannot confirm she was there,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a motive for the shooting remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interviewing witnesses, but they are hysterical. The
only thing we know for certain is that the alleged assailant gained
entrance to the residence, and the victims were shot in the
hallway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rio Hondo is a quiet rural community of about 2,000. Gonzalez
said the killings were the first in his seven years on the police
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had an incident like this, and the community is
beside itself. They can't believe it actually happened here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson Barr, 33, assigned to Eagle Pass, was the last Border
Patrol agent killed in Texas. Barr was shot to death while
attempting to apprehend drug smugglers in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent agent killed before the Tuesday shootings was
Alexander Kirpnick, who was shot to death June 3 near Nogales,
Ariz., while investigating drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-one agents have died in the 77-year history of the Border
Patrol.

SLIDE IN OIL AND INTERNET SHARES HELPS STALL SUMMER RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SHARON R. KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A summer rally stalled Tuesday as concerns about
stock valuations caused investors to sell shares that had strong
gains in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Recent high-flying Internet shares and oil producers, weakened
by falling crude oil prices, were at the center of the declines.
After climbing as much as 59 points, the Dow Jones industrial
average closed down 6.73 points, to 9,085.04, with Chevron among
the average's leading decliners. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index fell 2.67 points, to 1,154.66, and the Nasdaq composite index
slipped 1.36 points, to 1,908.11.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was weighed down by sizable declines
in several Internet-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, which soared 20 1/2 on Monday after the company announced
plans for a 2-for-1 stock split, plunged 14 9/16 Tuesday, to 85.
The stock had more than tripled this year, to 99 9/16 on Monday
from a low of 33 1/8 on Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet shares, including America Online, Yahoo,
Doubleclick and Earthlink, fell sharply. The shares had been rising
recently on speculation about potential acquisitions or
combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the Internet bookseller, fell 17 3/8, to 122 1/8.
Still, the stock has risen more than 300 percent this year. As a
result of such lofty gains, said Charles Pradilla, chief investment
strategist at Cowen &AMP; Co., Amazon and other Internet shares were
poised to fall as investors expressed skepticism about whether the
stocks had become too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very nervous about it,'' Pradilla said about the gains.
``Some of these companies are two years away from making money.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were some notable gains Tuesday. Merrill Lynch rose 3
5/16, to 104 5/16, a 52-week high. The shares moved higher amid
speculation that the company would split its stock, which would
allow more individual investors to buy shares. Merrill officials
declined to comment. Merrill last split its stock on May 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric rose 3/4, to 92 5/8 _ a new high _ as it became
the first American company with a market capitalization of more
than $300 billion. Its market capitalization, or the value of its
outstanding shares multiplied by its stock price, stood at $301.7
billion at the end of trading Tuesday. So far this year, GE shares
have gained more than 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such gains underscored the belief of some analysts that
Tuesday's declines would be short-lived and that the summer rally
would soon resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the summer rally is over yet,'' Pradilla said.
His confidence is grounded in the current low interest rates and
expectations that corporations will report strong second-quarter
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   James Griffin, senior vice president in charge of investment
strategy at Aeltus Investment Management, said, ``We're in a moment
of everything going right, and the real risks to this balance are
everything overseas'' in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, think American companies may have
already felt the worst sting from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the third quarter will be an important psychological
turning point,'' said Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``Beginning in August and September,
people will start to value stocks based on 1999 earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   And by September, the effect of economic measures enacted by the
Japanese government earlier this year should be apparent, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the third quarter, we should have more answers than
questions,'' Galvin said, ``and if investors just think that we've
started to hit a bottom, that's all we need to improve. Uncertainty
is usually the worst side of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, shares of large domestic banks fell sharply during
the fourth quarter of 1997 because of their exposure to Asia. That
drag on profits should not happen again this year, he said. &QL;

LABORERS DOING THE HEAVY LIFTING FOR UNIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not very surprising, in retrospect, that it was
the hod carriers, the floor sweepers, the stackers of bricks and
scaffolding who were at the heart of last week's unruly labor rally
in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of skilled tradesmen blocking streets and
stirring up the air to protest the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority's use of a nonunion contractor, as any bruised police
officer can attest, but the organizers, the ones who shoved and
shouted the hardest, were laborers.
</P>
<P>
   They are the ones most vulnerable to swings in the economy and
the encroachment of nonunion contractors, the first to be laid off
a job when a budget gets cut.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hellstrom, stocky and loud and typical of a new defiance
among young labor leaders, said it was no coincidence that his
union was at the vortex of the rally, just as it has been trying
for two years to energize the other building trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``A carpenter needs to be able to use a screw gun and read plans
and make cuts with sheet rock knives,'' said Hellstrom, assistant
organizing director of Local 79 of the Construction and Building
Laborers Union and one of a handful of people who brought together
40,000workers for the protest. ``But anybody can be a laborer.
Anybody. Anybody can stack brick and shovel mortar and sand and
sweep brooms and run pumps and hump stuff around on a job site. So
we're not going to be complacent like some of the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellstrom and his colleagues have brought what they call a
``warrior mentality'' to the 7,500 members of Local 79, making it
one of the most visible unions in New York over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown sick of the corruption that long plagued the union,
and wary of deals with politicians, the new leaders have created a
new arena on the streets outside nonunion job sites, holding mass
lunchtime rallies where thousands of members blow pink plastic
whistles and deliberately make annoyances of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Most prominently, the local borrowed an idea from some Chicago
unions and bought a pair of 15-foot rat balloons for about $4,000
each. Hellstrom carries them around in the back of his pickup truck
and happily inflates them at a moment's notice when a contractor
uses nonunion labor on a building site. The rats attract cameras,
the whistles attract passers-by, and the general effect brings a
good deal of attention to contractors who often prefer to operate
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to create a commotion,'' said Hellstrom, 32,
grinning at the thought of all the editorials that decried the
lawlessness of the midtown rally. ``The thing about
in-your-face-type organizing and militancy is, you're definitely
going to get your point across faster and you're going to be heard
faster. Our issues have been ignored for a long time, so if
shutting down the city streets got us the attention that we got
over this cause, then so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, it has worked. The union's organizing has
brought 1,500 previously nonunionized demolition workers into the
local, and the constant rallies persuaded a contractor at 80 John
Street to sign with the union. The state Labor Department has begun
investigating the practices of Roy Kay Inc., the nonunion
contractor that was the target of the midtown rally, based on
information provided by union officials.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The other building trades, which hung back from the Laborers'
more aggressive tactics for years, are starting to join in.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Malloy, president of the Building and Construction Trades
Council, which represents 100,000 construction workers, said that
Local 79 had done a ``tremendous job'' re-energizing the trades,
and that Hellstrom was one of a new breed of aggressive young
organizers turning up the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Kotler, who has taught Hellstrom in union organizing
classes at the Construction Industry Program of Cornell
University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations in Manhattan,
said Hellstrom was one of the most instinctive organizers he had
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough and street smart, and he represents a new
generation of people who are now in positions of union
responsibility, infusing a lot of energy into the building
trades,'' said Kotler, associate director of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Hellstrom, the grandson of Swedish immigrants, dropped out of
high school in the 11th grade to join the union, having been taken
to the union hall by his father _ a laborer even now _ at age 16.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of laborers, he became ``addicted to the good
money,'' as he put it, and never left, though he eventually got his
equivalency diploma. He worked on scores of construction sites over
the years, eventually becoming a labor foreman, and after the
federal government cleaned up and reorganized the local in 1996, he
moved into organizing.
</P>
<P>
   He's not sure where the militant streak came from, although he
suspects he picked it up reading about the early days of the labor
movement in America and the writings of the organizer Saul Alinsky.
</P>
<P>
   By now, he said, even his 3-year-old daughter, Stephanie, sings
union chants around the two-bedroom apartment he and his wife,
Angela, rent in Howard Beach, Queens, a few blocks from where he
grew up. He just hopes his daughter doesn't grow up to be quite as
rebellious as her dad. &QL;

ANALYSIS: DEATH OF NIGERIAN LEADER MAY EXACERBATE CONFLICTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the abrupt death Tuesday of Nigeria's most prominent
civilian politician, Moshood K.O. Abiola, Nigeria has suddenly lost
in the space of only one month the two leaders whose rivalry has
locked this country in a costly four-year stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   When Abiola's one-time friend and, more recently, jailer and
tormentor, President Sani Abacha, died last month, many Nigerians
were relieved, saying that finally, with the steel-fisted dictator
gone, political life could at last move forward.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition wanted Abiola proclaimed the rightful president
because he was clearly winning the 1993 elections before the
military annulled them. But the seemingly more moderate generals
who succeeded Abacha balked at the idea of Abiola as president.
Instead, the new government and, Nigerian opposition figures say,
some Western diplomats appeared set on persuading Abiola that he
had no claim on the presidency and should gracefully fade from the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   At one level Abiola's death, apparently after a heart attack,
would seem to settle the issue neatly.
</P>
<P>
   But in a country where few events _ especially sudden deaths _
rest on their readiest interpretations, where ethnic and regional
divisions remain immense and where the military's history of
dominating politics is so complete, Abiola's surprising end is only
likely to further complicate matters, at least in the turbulent
short term.
</P>
<P>
   There is already considerable resentment in Nigeria about what
is seen as a failure on the part of Western powers to demand that
the military turn over government to civilian democratic rule. Add
to this Abiola's death, and the main result is a potentially
explosive situation in which everyone distrusts everyone else,
including the outside brokers who come to help ease the country
forward.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance the outsider is the U.N. secretary-general,
Kofi Annan, who came to Nigeria last week and announced after a
meeting with Abiola that the politician wanted to ``get on with his
life'' and would no longer insist on claiming the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola's family and close supporters immediately disputed these
statements and asked bitterly why the jailed politician had not
been allowed to speak to the nation directly, or even meet with his
own advisers?
</P>
<P>
   Annan's visit was followed on Tuesday of last week by that of
Thomas Pickering, the U.S. undersecretary of state for political
affairs and a former ambassador to Nigeria, who met with Nigeria's
new leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, and was with Abiola when he
became ill.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats in Pickering's delegation said they had come to
Nigeria to insist on the release of all political prisoners, a
return to civilian rule and an early date for new elections.
Conspicuously absent, however, was any demand for a formal
political role for Abiola, the presumed winner of what have been
widely called the country's most democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
   In comments not intended for attribution, Western diplomats have
told journalists that Abiola's 1993 election can no longer be
considered valid, and it is widely assumed that they, like Annan,
were seeking to ease Abiola from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of these missions was good in theory if they were
aimed at pressuring the government to release Abiola and the other
prisoners and get on with elections,'' said Walter Carrington, a
recent U.S. ambassador to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``But starting with Annan's statements about renouncing a claim
to the presidency, any effort to get Abiola to relinquish his
mandate was very wrong. We should have insisted on his
unconditional release and that he be allowed to meet with his
supporters and not be forced to make agreements under duress.''
</P>
<P>
   Although its source is hard to pinpoint, Western ambivalence
toward Abiola is longstanding. After the 1993 elections were
annulled, Washington and London protested for a time, but then
stopped short of seeking validation for the results.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Western diplomats routinely urged the government to
release Abiola on humanitarian grounds, but never dwelled on his
presumed mandate or political legitimacy. The reasons for this
ambivalence, always invoked off the record, ranged from his
supposedly mercurial character to the demands he made for Western
reparations for the African slave trade, to his supposed contacts
with Nigerian drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his shady business dealings with military leaders,
including Abacha himself, and high-level involvement in the heavily
corrupt civilian politics of the 1980s, Abiola's more recent
democratic credentials were as solid as they come in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian government officials and Western diplomats alike
acknowledge that in the 1993 race, Abiola, a millionaire
businessman, was winning in every region of this traditionally
polarized country. This included leading his rival, Bashir Tofa, in
his heavily Muslim native city, Kano, in the far north.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola's acceptance outside his native southwest was helped by
his conversion to Islam long ago, and a history of deep-pocket
philanthropy that spread to every region.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerian reaction to Abiola's death, and to the latest
diplomacy, has been swift and powerfully bitter, particularly in
the southwest, where his Yoruba ethnic group _ one of the nation's
three largest _ deeply resents what it sees as yet another chapter
in its deliberate exclusion from power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in Nigeria will believe that M.K.O. Abiola renounced
the presidency,'' said Gani Fawehinmi, leader of the Joint Action
Committee of Nigeria, a major umbrella group of anti-military
opposition forces. ``What people will rather believe is that all of
the pressure being placed on him killed Abiola. But those who
wanted to be rid of Abiola will soon wish that he was back.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with reports of scattered unrest spreading through Lagos
and other parts of the Yoruba southwest, the liability of not
having Abiola around as a calming factor is already apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chief Abiola was the closest thing this nation had to a
leader,'' said Emanuel Ibru, a member of the opposition alliance
Nadeco. ``We are not just in shock and mourning; we are leaderless
now, and that is a very dangerous thing.''

U.S. TO UNVEIL NEW TYPE OF INFLATION-ADJUSTED SAVINGS BOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration plans to unveil
Wednesday a new type of government savings bond whose return will
rise and fall with inflation, to protect investors' gains as well
as to help finance the federal debt, Clinton administration
officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds will be sold in eight denominations, ranging from $50
to $10,000, and will mature in 30 years. Most of the denominations,
which bear the likenesses of Helen Keller, the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., Albert Einstein, and others, are to go on sale in
September. Two more denominations _ $200 and $10,000 _ will go on
sale next May.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the new securities, Vice President Al Gore plans
to promote them as offering an attractive means for middle-income
people to prepare for their retirements or a child's education.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the bonds as ``inflation insurance,'' a senior
Treasury official said on Tuesday that he expected them ``to be
attractive for people who want to be able to guarantee that they're
earning a substantial inflation-adjusted return on their money,
that'll double their money in real terms in less than a
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares for the presidential race in 2000, Gore is trying
to burnish his economic credentials, one White House official said,
and the administration's decision to have him rather than President
Clinton present the new bonds is part of that effort. Gore will
make the announcement at the Treasury Department with Secretary
Robert Rubin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In January 1997, the Treasury Department introduced its first
so-called inflation-indexed bonds, which were generally intended
for large institutional investors. Until then, the federal
government had financed the national debt by relying on fixed-rate
securities, which have a set, unchanging interest rate. Such bonds,
whose returns can be eroded or wiped out by inflation, have not
been a popular option compared to stocks or corporate bonds or
401(k) plans and other forms of long-term savings.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration hopes that the new, inflation-indexed
bonds _ or ``I-Bonds,'' as officials are calling them _ will appeal
to small investors. ``They're meant for and designed for small
investors,'' one official said. ``We think this is important to
avail small investors of the same benefits of inflation protection
that larger investors have.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other inflation-adjusted bonds _ but like other savings
bonds _ the new securities offer special tax benefits. As long as
investors hold their bonds, they may defer paying taxes on their
earnings, which are automatically reinvested and added to the
principal. Like other bonds issued by the Treasury, the new ones
are exempt from state and local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The tax protection ``would be a very nice feature for someone
who is, say, several years from retirement and in a high income
bracket, who wants to protect his portfolio from inflation but
without generating higher income,'' said Dan Pederson, president of
The Savings Bond Informer, Inc., a Detroit-based information
service provider for investors.
</P>
<P>
   If the bond is redeemed before its 30-year maturity to pay for
college tuition or other fees, investors may exclude part or all of
the interest from their income in calculating their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The average American is far more likely to hold savings bonds
than Treasury bonds: Roughly 55 million Americans, or approximately
1 in 3 households, own savings bonds, according to Pederson. In
all, investors hold about $180 billion in savings bonds, according
to the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' earnings from the new bonds will be determined by two
rates: a rate set by the Treasury Department that will remain the
same for the life of the bond; and a rate of inflation determined
every six months by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to reflect
changes in a version of the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   The new bonds are expected to be offered at a rate between 3
percent and 3.5 percent, less than the rate carried by fixed-rate
securities that offer no inflation protection.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the bonds will have some protection if deflation
sets in. Any decline in the consumer price index could eat into the
fixed rate, but it would not touch the underlying principal,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has given two major speeches recently on the economy, one
this spring before the Economic Club of Detroit and one last month
before the Center for National Policy in Washington. White House
aides said that the Wednesday announcement was intended to further
remind voters of his role in the administration's economic policy.
``The whole idea is to start building his profile more and more on
the economy, for obvious reasons,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also stepped up his partisan commentary on economic
matters. His speech before the Center for National Policy amounted
to a sharp critique of Republican economic policies. He accused the
Republican Congress of threatening ``to unravel our fiscal
discipline _ even at the risk of raising interest rates, shattering
confidence in our economy, and squandering the resources we need to
finally close the generational deficit.''

 &HT;    Expansion of Georgia nature areas at issue in Gingrich bill
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The future of two of Georgia's crown jewels _ the
Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area and the Cumberland
Island National Seashore _ could be significantly affected by two
new bills in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists are hailing a proposal by House Speaker Newt
Gingrich to expand the Chattahoochee recreation area as the first
big step toward a 48-mile-long greenway along the river between
Lake Lanier and Peachtree Creek.
</P>
<P>
   But they contend a measure introduced by Rep. Jack Kingston, a
Savannah Republican, would weaken protection of Cumberland Island.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the Gingrich bill is scheduled for July 16 in
Washington. Kingston hopes a hearing on his bill by the end of the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's measure would allow the park to include up to 10,000
acres, with the idea of creating a continuous 2,000-foot-wide
greenway along each side of the river. Currently, the park, which
attracts more than 3.5 million visitors per year, can be no bigger
than 6,800 acres, specified by legislation that created it 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   That legislation also has left the park divided into 14 units,
each separated by private property. A continuous greenway along the
river would join those units and other publicly owned areas along
the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision is that a person could walk or jog along 48 miles
of the river, from Buford Dam to Peachtree Creek,'' says Suzanne
Lewis, superintendent of the Chattahoochee recreation area.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that happens depends on the availability of funds and
whether private landowners are willing to sell their property to
the National Park Service, which manages the recreation area.
Gingrich's bill specifies that no private acreage will be condemned
for the park.
</P>
<P>
   But a lack of funds and the unwillingness of some landowners to
sell their property already have hampered the agency's ability to
acquire all of the 6,800 acres originally authorized by Congress
for the park, which now contains only about 4,500 acres. Some of
the land originally authorized has been lost to development,
especially areas along Holcomb Bridge Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several neighborhoods that are now in the recreation
area boundaries, but we certainly are not going to condemn
neighborhoods for park land,'' says Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's has estimated that the cost of acquiring the greenway
land is about $65 million. His bill calls for the federal
government to provide $25 million; the rest would come from state
and local governments, private foundations, corporations and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   A public-private partnership acquired much of the 4,500 acres
that now make up the recreation area. For instance, the Trust for
Public Land, a conservation organization, helped negotiate
protection of 10 properties along the Chattahoochee, including the
Powers Homestead and Hyde Farm in Cobb County, and five properties
to complete three miles of river frontage along Bowman's Island in
Gwinnett and Forsyth counties.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich acknowledges that the TPL will play a major role in
acquiring the greenway land. ``We're looking at tracts up and down
the river,'' says TPL director Rand Wentworth.
</P>
<P>
   On Georgia's coast, the Cumberland Island National Seashore,
known for its haunting beauty and as the site of John F. Kennedy
Jr.'s wedding, is the subject of a new bill that has drawn intense
fire from environmentalists. Critics say Kingston's measure would
wreck efforts by the Nature Conservancy of Georgia to acquire the
privately owned 1,100-acre Greyfield tract and make it part of the
national seashore.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Authorize federal funds to restore historic buildings on the
island, including the 22,000-square-foot Plum Orchard Mansion built
in 1898 by the Carnegie family. Plum Orchard and the main road
through the 18-mile-long island would be removed from wilderness
designation, allowing vehicles in portions of the island now
off-limits to cars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Authorize a land-swap deal championed by Kingston, in which
the heirs of Coca-Cola founder Asa Candler would purchase the
Greyfield tract that splits the national seashore boundaries and
give it to the national seashore. In return, the Candler family
would reclaim another tract of roughly 1,000 acres on the north tip
of the island that the family owned until 1982.

YANKEES MAKING HISTORY THROUGH TEAMWORK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   61-20, that's an NBA record.
</P>
<P>
   That's the '67-68 76ers, the '80-81 Celtics or the '84-85 Lakers
with a game to go. Some basketball team rather regularly wins 75
percent of its games. Sixty wins out of 82 is an attainable figure
in that sport. Since the institution of an 80-game schedule in
1961, 45 NBA teams have won 60 games or more.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball? Uh-uh, no way. The dynamics of baseball are so
entirely different. If an NBA team has a great starting five and a
couple of reliable substitutes, and if it can remain reasonably
healthy, it can win 60 games. Baseball's variables start with the
identity of that day's starting pitcher and they end with the idea
that a team could conceivably be subject to a perfect game setback
in which 27 consecutive men were retired on vicious line drives. In
the entire 20th century, only four baseball teams have won 60 of
their first 80 games. They are the 1902 Pirates, the 1907 Cubs, and
the 1912 Giants. And, of course, the 1998 New York Yankees, who are
61-20 at the halfway mark.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-six years is a long wait. The paint in Fenway Park was
hardly dry when a team last won 60 of its first 80 games.
</P>
<P>
   The next targets for the Yankees are the American League records
of 111 wins and a .721 winning percentage, each held by the 1954
Cleveland Indians, and the major league standards of 116 wins and a
.763 winning percentage, established by the 1906 Chicago Cubs. They
will need to win 117 to move in front of the Cubs and a staggering
124 to claim the all-time percentage record.
</P>
<P>
   The 1906 Cubs had four Hall of Fame players in manager/first
baseman Frank Chance, second baseman Johnny Evers, shortstop Joe
Tinker, and pitcher Mordecai ``Three Finger'' Brown. There were no
gaudy offensive stats, even by the dead ball standards of the day.
Third baseman Harry Steinfeldt was the leading batter (.327) and
run producer (83 runs batted in, or 18 fewer than Juan Gonzalez has
right now). The pitching numbers are impressive, as befits a team
that was 116-36. The highest ERA among their top six pitchers was
Carl Lundgren's 2.21.
</P>
<P>
   They won the pennant by 20 games over a good New York Giants
team. There was further competition from Pittsburgh, which had such
greats as Honus Wagner, Fred Clarke, and Ginger Beaumont. The rest
of the eight-team league was under .500.
</P>
<P>
   The 1954 Indians likewise had four Hall of Famers, three of whom
were pitchers. The twin aces were Bob Lemon (23-7) and Early Wynn
(23-11). The third Hall of Famer was 36-year-old Bob Feller, who
was 13-3 as a spot starter. Hall of Famer No. 4 was center fielder
Larry Doby, who led the league with 32 homers and 126 ribbies.
Second baseman Bobby Avila won the batting title with a .341
average in what had to go down as his career year.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching was, of course, phenomenal. Mike Garcia was the
third starter, and all he did was go 19-8 and lead the league with
a 2.64 ERA. Art Houtteman was 15-7. Rookies Don Mossi (6-1, 1.94)
and Ray Narleski (3-3, 2.22) tied down the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   There most definitely was competition. The Yankees won 103 games
that year, and no Casey Stengel team ever won as many. Chicago won
94 games to finish third. No other team broke .500.
</P>
<P>
   It is fashionable right now to say that what makes the current
Yankees so special is that, offensively speaking, no one is having
that so-called career year. That's not entirely true. Third baseman
Scott Brosius hit .203 last year, and he's on his way to
approximating his '96 numbers. Bernie Williams was hitting .353
when he went down. Derek Jeter might wind up with some very nice
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But no Yankee regular started the All-Star Game, and hardly
anyone squawked. What characterizes the Yankees on offense is
balance and depth. They survived the two-week loss of Jeter and
they still are sailing along with Chad Curtis in center while
Williams struggles to get healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Their starters are no threat to the memory of Lemon, Wynn, and
Garcia, but it's a different game now. Mossi and Narleski were good
in '54, but neither was a Mariano Rivera. The Yankees have six guys
who can start, and manager Joe Torre can expect a solid
professional performance from any of them every night out.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, every ego gets checked at the door before every
game. Torre, who absolutely, positively should be Manager of the
Year, sets the tone, establishing a comfort zone that is so
necessary because, after all, the Yankees are owned by a dangerous
meddler. Other teams may talk about doing the so-called little
things that lead to wins, but the Yankees do more than talk. If
nothing else, what the Yankees are proving is that all modern
athletes aren't totally self-absorbed. This Yankee team has one
common purpose, and that is to win this game, here and now. The
pledge is then renewable on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are a true T-E-A-M. The 1998 Yankees have one
projected Hall of Famer in Jeter, and that is it. The next closest
possibility, believe it or not, is Tim Raines. If they are
analagous in this regard to any team someone under 50 could
possibly relate to, it is the 1984 Tigers of 35-5 fame. (You could
argue that Jack Morris and Alan Trammell might be
Cooperstown-bound, but neither is anything approaching a lock).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are marching along an awe-inspiring historical path
in their quest to break the record, but there is one thing they
should know about the 1906 Cubs and the 1954 Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Neither won the World Series.

GLORY FOR OFT-OVERLOOKED BRAZILIAN GOALKEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSEILLE, France _ In Brazil, the common wisdom goes, the
goalkeepers are the players who were not blessed with dancing feet.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian goalkeepers have their moments, however, and Claudio
Andre Mergen Taffarel, known to all the soccer world as Taffarel,
had his moment Tuesday night, stopping two of four penalty kicks to
help Brazil win a tiebreaker over the Netherlands, after the two
had battled to a 1-1 tie in the semifinal of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil will now go on to play the winner of Wednesday night's
France-Croatia match in the final on Sunday in St. Denis. The
Brazilians won their fourth World Cup in 1994 when Taffarel stopped
Italy after a dispassionate 0-0 tie in the mid-afternoon California
heat, a brutal game time dictated by European television.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's game, played under a near full moon with a
breeze cooling a heat wave, was far superior to the 1994 finale.
This was a run-and-shoot battle between the world's great soccer
dynasty and the nation that is proud to be called The Brazil of
Europe, strong praise for a nation that has never won a World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo scored early in the second half on a quick strike, and
the Netherlands bravely held on, staging a gallant goal in the 87th
minute on a header by Patrick Kluivert, the third time the Dutch
had scored late in their last three games.
</P>
<P>
   If the crowd at Stade Velodrome had been given a vote, it would
surely have pleaded for the two teams to continue playing after the
120 minutes. Instead, it was time for the shootout in the world's
only major sport with a dice-rolling way of ending a tie. Ronaldo
shot past Erwin Van Der Sar, the towering 6-foot-6 Dutch
goalkeeper. Then Frank DeBoer, the resolute Dutch captain who spent
the night marking Ronaldo, scored past Taffarel.
</P>
<P>
   Rivaldo made his penalty cleanly and Dennis Bergkamp, barely
noticeable all night, made his. Emerson, a late substitute, made
Brazil's third penalty. Then Philip Cocu, the offensive-minded
midfielder, took his turn. Taffarel did a little dance in place,
then dived to his left and punched the ball away with both hands.
</P>
<P>
   Dunga, with his military-style flat-top cut, made his penalty.
Ronald DeBoer, the twin brother of the Dutch captain, was next.
Taffarel did his little dance, then dove to his right and smothered
a low kick and came up brandishing his two index fingers and baying
at the full moon.
</P>
<P>
   The game was over, although the Dutch players stayed around in
the orange shirts. Many of them play with the Brazilians in the
Italian and Spanish leagues, and there was considerable embracing
and kind words. This was the third game of this World Cup to be
decided on penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very organized, very aware, they made good rushes,''
Mario Zagallo, the Argentine coach, said, complimenting the
Netherlands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were more than enough thrills for both sides, each of
which played without a starting defender because of an accumulation
of yellow cards. In addition, the top Dutch replacement was out
with a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players who replaced them did a good job,'' said Gus
Hiddink, the Dutch coach. ``We must not search for excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   No excuses were needed. The two teams traded feints in the first
half, with long runs and expert passes.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after halftime, Brazil scored. Rivaldo slipped a
ball through to Ronaldo, who rushed the goal with Cocu grabbing at
his shirt, but Ronaldo put the ball under Van Der Sar.
</P>
<P>
   In the 62nd minute, Ronaldo burst through and hit the goalkeeper
in the head with his lower leg. The keeper sat on the ground for
several minutes before the game resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil picked up the tempo when Zagallo sent in Denilson for
Bebeto, a highly popular move with Brazilian fans. The Brazilians
suddenly seemed to have an extra attacker. In the 78th minute,
Rivaldo fed Denilson, who returned the ball to Rivaldo, who was
stopped by Van Der Sar.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Kluivert used his height to send several headers at
Taffarel. But the Dutch were still scoreless at the 87th minute,
when Cocu send a ball down the right sideline. The whole stadium
swiveled to watch Ronald DeBoer make what might have been the last
Dutch strike.
</P>
<P>
   DeBoer made the most of it, with a hard, twisting kick that came
down in the goal area, where Kluivert connected with his head,
putting the ball to the left of Taffarel and tying the score.
</P>
<P>
   In the first overtime, the two teams traded chances. In the
second overtime, Frank DeBoer took down Ronaldo in the penalty box,
a move that would have been worth a red card for most of this
tournament, but the official, Ali Mohamed Bujsaim of the United
Arab Emirates, let it go. The teams still were going at it when the
final whistle set up the lottery of the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I selected my players carefully,'' Zagallo said. ``I wanted to
show confidence in my players.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach was asked if this was an individual victory because
Taffarel stopped two penalties. He said, ``No, this is a victory
for everybody. We're here to represent Brazil. Every player
contributed to this victory. All over the world, Brazilian fans are
celebrating. We have to wait, because we only celebrate after the
championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil can talk about championship games. The Dutch can only
talk about playing exciting soccer, and falling short, once again. &QL;

TWO BORDER PATROL AGENTS SHOT DEAD IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Complete writethru _ adds death of suspect, info on search
for others.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER and JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BENITO, Texas _ Two U.S. Border Patrol agents were ambushed
and killed early Tuesday while helping local authorities
investigate a fatal shooting near this South Texas city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspect came out of the cornfield and literally ambushed
my agents. All indications are they never had a chance to use their
guns,'' said Joe Garza, the Border Patrol chief in McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   The dead agents were identified as Ricardo Guillermo Salinas,
24, of San Antonio, who graduated from the Border Patrol Academy in
January, and Susan L. Rodriguez, 28, of Harlingen, daughter of a
retired Border Patrol deputy chief.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Rodriguez, who was a training officer, nor Salinas, who
was nearing the end of his probationary period, had drawn a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The man detained in connection with the deaths of the two agents
and of two women in Rio Hondo died in a Harlingen hospital late
Tuesday following surgery for multiple gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials identified him as Ernest Moore, 24, of San
Benito.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known who shot Moore or under what circumstances. It
also was not clear whether Moore acted alone, but hundreds of law
enforcement officers continued to search for at least one more
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``These killers will be found,'' said Doris Meissner,
commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which
oversees the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deaths of these fine young people cannot go unpunished. We
will do everything in our power to see that the person or persons
responsible for this tragedy are swiftly brought to justice,'' said
Meissner, who flew to Texas after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The two civilians killed in Rio Hondo, a small community
northeast of Harlingen, were identified as Dalia Morin, 31, and her
mother, Margarita Flores, 52.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron County Sheriff's Deputy Raul Rodriguez and Dan Morin,
22, were wounded in Rio Hondo. They were being treated at Valley
Baptist Medical Center for gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the bloody sequence of events began shortly
after 5 a.m. when Dalia and Dan Morin and Flores were shot at a
house in Rio Hondo.
</P>
<P>
   The police responded and put out an alert for a white pickup
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez spotted the truck, gave chase, lost it and radioed for
assistance. Rodriguez and three Border Patrol agents later found
the truck outside Moore's home south of San Benito.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio, the four were
about to search the adjacent area when they were attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stepped out of the cornfield and cut them down,'' Lucio
said of the suspected gunman.
</P>
<P>
   The third Border Patrol agent involved had not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first killing of a Border Patrol agent in Texas since
1996. Rodriguez was the first woman agent killed on active duty.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio said authorities were looking for one or two additional
people who were spotted with Moore after the Rio Hondo shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to mention any suspects yet because we want to
make sure we have an airtight case,'' the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Lopez, 15, who lives near the Moore residence, awoke to
the sound of gunshots Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real rapid. It was like it wouldn't stop,'' said Lopez,
who said a steady stream of police cars, followed by aircraft,
responded to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Gonzalez, chief of the four-man Rio Hondo Police
Department, said the victims of the shooting apparently did not
know their assailant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he is an ex-boyfriend of one of the people staying
at the residence. She may have been a guest of theirs, but at this
time we cannot confirm she was there,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a motive for the shooting remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interviewing witnesses, but they are hysterical. The
only thing we know for certain is that the alleged assailant gained
entrance to the residence, and the victims were shot in the
hallway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rio Hondo is a quiet rural community of about 2,000. Gonzalez
said the killings were the first in his seven years on the police
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had an incident like this, and the community is
beside itself. They can't believe it actually happened here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson Barr, 33, assigned to Eagle Pass, was the last Border
Patrol agent killed in Texas. Barr was shot to death while
attempting to apprehend drug smugglers in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent agent killed before the Tuesday shootings was
Alexander Kirpnick, who was shot to death June 3 near Nogales,
Ariz., while investigating drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-one agents have died in the 77-year history of the Border
Patrol.

TAKING A PAGE FROM EACH OTHER'S PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 12)  
 (JT)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Sol Hurok, an impresario with a keen eye on the box
office, who grasped the ballet public's hunger for what he insisted
on calling novelties. These were new productions, mainly premieres
but also revivals of works so rarely seen that they took on the
aura of a premiere. A prime example was Hurok's historic
presentation of a full-length ``Sleeping Beauty'' when the Sadler's
Wells Ballet made its New York debut in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   During their recent seasons, American Ballet Theater and New
York City Ballet each offered the same two kinds of novelties. Both
commissioned a new work and presented an unusual revival,
transferred from another company.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Martins, City Ballet's artistic director, choreographed
``River of Light,'' named after the score that Charles Wuorinen
wrote for him. Ballet Theater's original work was ``The Snow
Maiden,'' co-produced with Houston Ballet and choreographed by Ben
Stevenson, Houston's artistic director. The first performance in
both Houston and New York was led by the same ballerina in the
title role, Nina Ananiashvili.
</P>
<P>
   City Ballet's company premiere was ``Les Noces,'' Jerome
Robbins' treatment of Stravinsky's score, first done in 1965 for
Ballet Theater. This season, that troupe adapted ``Le Corsaire''
from a 1997 Boston Ballet production. The Boston staging was the
first American version of Marius Petipa's 1899 full-length classic,
itself redone by Soviet choreographers, including Konstantin
Sergeyev. It was his 1992 staging for the Bolshoi Ballet (tightened
and with some set pieces moved around) that was on view in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   This pairing of a genuine premiere and a work new to a company
made for variety and historical texture, especially at City Ballet,
where the emphasis is on original ballets. ``Le Corsaire'' was the
season's mega-hit, thanks to its powerhouse male dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Novelties may seem a paradox in an art form that is defined by
repertory, an established body of works. Yet even dancers and
audiences loyal to the ballets that initially attracted them can
tire of their repetition. Incidentally, ballet owes its repertory
to creativity. Old works were once new.
</P>
<P>
   As things turn out, the City Ballet premiere, ``River of Light''
is one of Martins' best pieces, exceptional in its extension of the
classical vocabulary. Wuorinen and Martins are on the same wave
length. Danciness, supported by a sustained melodic phrase, is too
sentimental for them, but emotion and drama are not absent from the
entangled complexities of their fusion of sound and movement.
``River of Light'' evokes tension but also resolution. There is
even a ritualized cast to the action onstage for three couples who
end up with new partners.
</P>
<P>
   On a formal level, Martins is concerned with variations on the
ballet adagio. His images are angular and sculptural, succinctly
inverting conventional shapes but not the academic steps that
define his choreography as neo-classical. Each couple is identified
by the color of its leotards: black for Monique Meunier and Jock
Soto, white for Alexandra Ansanelli and Charles Askegard, red for
Darci Kistler and Sebastien Marcovici.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Stanley's effective if unsubtle lighting amplifies the
visual impact. Rectangles and pools of light confine the space, but
V-shaped beams on the backdrop intensify the dancing toward the
end. When the couples pair up with different partners, the drama
stems not from the implied wife-swapping but from formal structure.
Will the different partnerships create a new context and modify our
initial view of the dancers?
</P>
<P>
   Each soloist does in fact react differently to the second
partner. Ms. Meunier, a splendid allegro dancer, finally has an
adagio role that suits her. There is a striking image in which she
and Soto seem to be holding onto each other while pulling apart.
Ms. Ansanelli and Askegard, both stretching the linear into the
angular, are less disputatious, while Ms. Kistler, swooning in
Marcovici's arms, telegraphs passion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the second half, the pairing of Ms. Meunier and Askegard
(black and white leotards) is built on contrast and contortions.
Ms. Ansanelli and Marcovici (white and red) fit their angular
bodies into a jigsaw puzzle. Ms. Kistler and Soto (red and black)
have the hot number. Soto is more dominant than in his duet with
Ms. Meunier, and he covers Ms. Kistler's eyes with her own hands
before maneuvering her into tilts and lifts. The sound of chimes
ushers in the final image: revolving men holding the women
overhead, an eternal round of human passions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ansanelli contributed her star presence as the bride in the
Russian peasant wedding of ``Les Noces.'' Like Robert Wersinger,
the groom , she captured the submissiveness and exultation that
Robbins infuses into his interpretation of the Stravinsky score.
Bronislava Nijinska, who choreographed the original version, in
1923, saw things differently and made her characters anonymous and
abstract. The Robbins women are in laced shoes while Nijinska's
were on toe, which did not prevent the critic Andre Levinson, a
staunch defender of classicism, from calling her choreography
mechanistic. George Balanchine agreed with him later that
Stravinsky's score was a cantata, meant to be heard and not danced.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Stravinsky wrote a ballet score and Robbins'
theatricality might be as effective as it still was in the 1970s if
he dropped his current use of a recording and went back to his
initial staging. To see four grand pianos, a chorus and dancers
before the two huge saints on Oliver Smith's backdrop was to see no
ordinary spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Spectacle, one suspects, was the word that Kevin McKenzie,
Ballet Theater's artistic director, keeps in mind in his search for
three-act ballets to fill the Metropolitan Opera House. As a
premiere, ``The Snow Maiden'' fit the bill but only up to a point.
The story, drawn from various Russian sources, of a snow fairy who
melts under the sun for love of a mortal, is a perfect vehicle for
ballerinas like Ms. Ananiashvili and Susan Jaffe. Desmond Heeley's
sets and costumes are beautiful, and Stevenson's choreography for
the principals has some rich intricacies. But ours is not a
Romantic era, and an ersatz Romantic ballet can look pretty rather
than deep. A two-act version would work better, especially since
the Tchaikovsky pieces that John Lanchbery has stitched into a
ballet score fail to offer consistent dance support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Le Corsaire'' was more of a risk, a hodgepodge production
viable only if its interpolations from various composers and
choreographers over a century were rendered coherent. Inconsistent
technique in some casts reduced the ballet to an amusing adventure
yarn about a pirate rescuing his beloved from assorted villains.
But on the whole, it was a gamble fabulously won. Anyone who saw
the astonishing bravura of Angel Corella, Ethan Stiefel, Jose
Manuel Carreno, Parrish Maynard, Vladimir Malakhov, Giuseppe Picone
and John Selya as well as the exquisite Petipa fragment for three
very classical Odalisques in powder-blue tutus will not forget
these performances. The most spectacular dancing in the world was
on view here; now,  &UR; that &LR;  was ballet.

30 NON-STARS INVITED TO USA BASKETBALL TROUTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It's not Grant Hill or Tim Duncan. It's more like Otis Hill and
Earl Duncan. That's what happens when you have to redo things at
the 11th hour.
</P>
<P>
   USA Basketball Tuesday released a list of 30 players who have
accepted invitations to this week's tryout camp to select a team
for the upcoming world championships. Suffice it to say, this may
well be the worst assemblage of talent for a USA Basketball men's
team since, well, Acie Earl missed free throws shooting alone.
</P>
<P>
   Whoops. Acie Earl is one of the 30. How do you say zone
qualifier in Spanish?
</P>
<P>
   This is the team that was put together on short notice after the
12 NBA players were replaced last month for refusing to
unequivocally commit pending the imposition of a lockout by the
league. While USA Basketball is not a part of the NBA, the players
felt they would be advertising and marketing commodities for the
league and decided not to go. The league, of course, locked out the
players two weeks after USA Basketball dis-invited the NBA
contingent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several ``marquee'' players without a current NBA
affiliation, such as Clyde Drexler, Dominique Wilkins, and Byron
Scott, were thought to be under consideration. Wilkins told the
Globe last week that while flattered to be considered, he could not
``betray'' the NBA players by participating.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the replacement team. Of the 30 candidates, 24 played
in the CBA or Europe last season, four are college underclassmen,
and two have just completed their college eligibility. Earl is one
of three players who have donned a Celtics uniform; the others are
point guard Michael Hawkins and shooting guard Jimmy Oliver. Many
have some NBA experience and they range in age from 34 (Wendell
Alexis, Tim Kempton) to 20 (UConn's Richard Hamilton).
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Tomjanovich of the Rockets, who is coaching the team with
help from Del Harris, Lon Kruger (Illinois), and Mike Jarvis (St.
John's), said in a statement from USA Basketball that ``we feel
confident that out of this group, we can and will field a very
competitive team. There's limited training time, but we will try
and give these players a real good look.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have spent some time in the NBA include Earl,
Kempton, David Wood (involved in a Dennis Rodman trade), Larry
Stewart, Oliver, Randy Livingston (Boston Shootout star), Jimmy
King, Hawkins, Tim Breaux, and Ashraf Amaya. Wood, Livingston, and
Breaux have all played for Tomjanovich. The four collegians are
Hamilton, Duke's Trajan Langdon, Northwestern's Evan Eschmeyer, and
Mateen Cleaves from Michigan State. The two who just completed
school are Earl Boykins of Eastern Michigan and Brad Miller of
Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the team to train in Chicago through July 14 and
then a 12-man group will head to Europe. While in Europe, the team
will train in Monte Carlo and Rome and play exhibition games
against France, Spain, and Italy. The world championships will be
held July 29-Aug. 9 in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   The team must win the gold medal in the championships to gain an
automatic bye in the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney. Short of that,
the US must qualify for the Games in a pre-Olympic tournament,
probably in Central or South America, either in 1999 or 2000.
Normally, the top four finishers qualify for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA players originally selected to participate were Vin
Baker, Gary Payton, Chris Webber, Tim Hardaway, Tim Duncan, Grant
Hill, Allan Houston, Glen Rice, Terrell Brandon, Christian
Laettner, Kevin Garnett, and Tom Gugliotta.

MARYLAND MOURNS A POLITICAL FIXTURE AS RACE TO SUCCEED HIM HEATS
UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCE FREDERICK, Md. _ If only for a moment Tuesday, the tumult
of Maryland state politics this year was calmed.
</P>
<P>
   More than a thousand friends, relatives and colleagues of all
political persuasion traveled deep into southern Maryland on
Tuesday, to pay their last respects to Louis Goldstein, Maryland's
comptroller for the last 40 years. He died of a heart attack at his
home here Friday at the age of 85.
</P>
<P>
   At an hourlong funeral service at the Trinity United Methodist
Church here, they listened as Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., told them
what most already felt, that Goldstein, a fellow Democrat,
''ennobled our politics and enriched our lives. We shall miss him
dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   By one measure, the void left by Goldstein's death was filled
rapidly. When he announced last month that he intended to seek an
11th term as the state's tax collector, just one Republican stepped
up to challenge him, and few politicians of either party gave him
much of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   But by the filing deadline Monday, 7 Republicans and 12
Democrats _ including former Gov. William Donald Schaefer _ had
decided to run for comptroller in the September primary. The list
also included Michael Barnes, a former congressman who was
appointed earlier in the day by Gov. Parris Glendening to serve out
the remaining six months of Goldstein's term.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein was the closest thing to a sure bet in Maryland
politics. He was victorious in 14 of 15 elections, dating back to
his years as a state legislator _ his only loss came in the 1964
primary for the U.S. Senate. The virtual certainty that he would
have won again this year gave state Democrats one of their few
sources of electoral tranquility. The year has been otherwise
marked by rancor and divided loyalties, leaving Glendening as one
of the few incumbent governors vulnerable to a strong challenge
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening faces a determined run in the primary by Harford
County Executive Eileen Rehrmann, who has the support of two
influential politicians, Mayor Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke and
Prince George's County Executive Wayne Curry.
</P>
<P>
   If Glendening prevails, he faces a probable rematch in the
general election with Ellen Sauerbrey, a Republican who lost to him
by fewer than 6,000 votes in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sauerbrey, a former state legislator, was the only major
state politician who did not attend Goldstein's funeral, which
attracted a virtual who's who of Maryland officials, including
three of Glendening's predecessors _ Schaefer, Harry Hughes and
Marvin Mandel. Jim Dornan, a spokesman for Ms. Sauerbrey, said she
was attending a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Sauerbrey missed was an endearing sendoff for a public
servant whose style and stripe has largely disappeared from the
American political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an old breed of politician, who brought Republicans and
Democrats together,'' said Thomas Miller, a Democrat who serves as
president of the Maryland Senate. ``Now, you find a minority of
people trust in government, but he was from the old school, someone
who believed that government service was public service. He
believed it was a noble calling.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Republican Party chairman Joyce Terhes, who lives not
far from Goldstein's home, said that his friendship always
transcended politics. She called him ''a wonderfully good
politician'' but also a family friend who always honored their
political differences by assuring her, ``I go to bed every night
with a Republican,'' referring to his wife, Hazel, who died in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Before, during and after the service, stories of Goldstein's
unflagging energy filled the air. Mandel recalled joining him on a
campaign stop at a Chestertown, Md., department store, where
employees lined up to greet them. Goldstein shook every hand
extended, Mandel said, but grew concerned when one that did not
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was shaking hands with a mannequin,'' Mandel said.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Sarbanes recalled the time when Goldstein
climbed a utility pole to greet a telephone company lineman and
another when he drove along a rural lane waving at an apparently
empty barn ''just in case someone was inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Glendening, who called Goldstein's death ``clearly, the end of
an age,'' said he always found it ironic that Goldstein was ``a tax
collector who was beloved'' by the state's taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   That was clearly evident by the size of the audience, 300 who
filled the church and more than three times that number who sat on
folding chairs outside of it, listening to the service over loud
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   If one sentiment seemed to unite them it was spoken by Perry
Bowen, a former judge and old friend of Goldstein's, who followed
Sarbanes to the altar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only going to miss him once,'' Bowen said. ``That's
always.'' &QL;

SUPREMACIST SAYS LEGAL FEES NEARING $150,000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Miss.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The leader of a Mississippi-based white supremacist
organization, which won a court ruling invalidating the Boston
ordinance that regulates parade permits, said his legal fees in the
case may reach $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge George A. O'Toole has ordered Boston to pay
the fees of Richard Barrett's group known as the Nationalist
Movement. O'Toole ruled city officials illegally denied the group a
permit to march in South Boston in 1994, because they disagreed
with the group's ideas. The judge will eventually decide if the
fees sought by Barrett are reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole also awarded Barrett $700 in extra travel expenses he
incurred fighting for the permit .
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my only wish that (Mayor Thomas M.) Menino would have to
pay it out of his own pocket,'' said Barrett, who is general
counsel of his group. ``He was a shill for the homosexual and
minority lobby. It is not right to run to roughshod over the rights
of everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the mayor declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Boston civil rights lawyer, Harvey A. Schwartz, who represented
the Nationalist Movement in the suit, could not be reached for
comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said his group has won 13 other similar First Amendment
suits throughout the county and lost only one -- in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Several people have asked him to move to South Boston, Barrett
said last night, adding ``I might consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the ordinance, O'Toole said it illegally gave
city officials wide discretion to grant or deny permits without any
limiting standards.
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole said the reasons the city offered for denying Barrett a
permit _ traffic congestion and concerns about public safety _ were
pretexts. He noted the city had granted permits to other groups
under similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett came to Boston in 1994 after organizers of the South
Boston St Patrick's Day Parade canceled it rather than comply with
a court order requiring them to allow a gay and lesbian group to
march.
</P>
<P>
   Without a permit Barrett went ahead and marched along the
sidewalk on Broadway ending with a rally in front of South Boston
High School. Police kept a large crowd of counter demonstrators
away from the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week O'Toole entered a permanent injunction prohibiting the
city from enforcing the parade permit ordinance and said it must be
rewritten to leave ``no leeway for content-based restrictions as to
who ought to be permitted to march.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature and content of the Nationalist Movement's message
was the predominant reason it was treated differently and had its
permit request denied,'' the judge declared.

TWO BORDER PATROL AGENTS SHOT DEAD IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Complete writethru _ adds death of suspect, info on search
for others.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER and JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BENITO, Texas _ Two U.S. Border Patrol agents were ambushed
and killed early Tuesday while helping local authorities
investigate a fatal shooting near this South Texas city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspect came out of the cornfield and literally ambushed
my agents. All indications are they never had a chance to use their
guns,'' said Joe Garza, the Border Patrol chief in McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   The dead agents were identified as Ricardo Guillermo Salinas,
24, of San Antonio, who graduated from the Border Patrol Academy in
January, and Susan L. Rodriguez, 28, of Harlingen, daughter of a
retired Border Patrol deputy chief.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Rodriguez, who was a training officer, nor Salinas, who
was nearing the end of his probationary period, had drawn a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The man detained in connection with the deaths of the two agents
and of two women in Rio Hondo died in a Harlingen hospital late
Tuesday following surgery for multiple gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials identified him as Ernest Moore, 24, of San
Benito.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known who shot Moore or under what circumstances. It
also was not clear whether Moore acted alone, but hundreds of law
enforcement officers continued to search for at least one more
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``These killers will be found,'' said Doris Meissner,
commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which
oversees the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deaths of these fine young people cannot go unpunished. We
will do everything in our power to see that the person or persons
responsible for this tragedy are swiftly brought to justice,'' said
Meissner, who flew to Texas after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The two civilians killed in Rio Hondo, a small community
northeast of Harlingen, were identified as Dalia Morin, 31, and her
mother, Margarita Flores, 52.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron County Sheriff's Deputy Raul Rodriguez and Dan Morin,
22, were wounded in Rio Hondo. They were being treated at Valley
Baptist Medical Center for gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the bloody sequence of events began shortly
after 5 a.m. when Dalia and Dan Morin and Flores were shot at a
house in Rio Hondo.
</P>
<P>
   The police responded and put out an alert for a white pickup
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez spotted the truck, gave chase, lost it and radioed for
assistance. Rodriguez and three Border Patrol agents later found
the truck outside Moore's home south of San Benito.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio, the four were
about to search the adjacent area when they were attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stepped out of the cornfield and cut them down,'' Lucio
said of the suspected gunman.
</P>
<P>
   The third Border Patrol agent involved had not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first killing of a Border Patrol agent in Texas since
1996. Rodriguez was the first woman agent killed on active duty.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio said authorities were looking for one or two additional
people who were spotted with Moore after the Rio Hondo shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to mention any suspects yet because we want to
make sure we have an airtight case,'' the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Lopez, 15, who lives near the Moore residence, awoke to
the sound of gunshots Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real rapid. It was like it wouldn't stop,'' said Lopez,
who said a steady stream of police cars, followed by aircraft,
responded to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Gonzalez, chief of the four-man Rio Hondo Police
Department, said the victims of the shooting apparently did not
know their assailant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he is an ex-boyfriend of one of the people staying
at the residence. She may have been a guest of theirs, but at this
time we cannot confirm she was there,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a motive for the shooting remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interviewing witnesses, but they are hysterical. The
only thing we know for certain is that the alleged assailant gained
entrance to the residence, and the victims were shot in the
hallway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rio Hondo is a quiet rural community of about 2,000. Gonzalez
said the killings were the first in his seven years on the police
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had an incident like this, and the community is
beside itself. They can't believe it actually happened here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson Barr, 33, assigned to Eagle Pass, was the last Border
Patrol agent killed in Texas. Barr was shot to death while
attempting to apprehend drug smugglers in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent agent killed before the Tuesday shootings was
Alexander Kirpnick, who was shot to death June 3 near Nogales,
Ariz., while investigating drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-one agents have died in the 77-year history of the Border
Patrol.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a steamy afternoon during the drawing marathon at
the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture, I
learned the meaning of repentance. How had I sinned by drawing?
That was not immediately evident. But there I was, muttering
``repent, repent, repent'' under my breath and erasing furiously.
</P>
<P>
   When the drawing marathon began, in mid-June, 97 artists,
students, architects, Sunday painters, art critics and teachers
from Australia, Mexico, Switzerland, England, Israel, California,
Alabama, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C. stood ready at their
easels to draw for eight hours a day, five days a week, in the
rambling building that had once been the original Whitney Museum.
</P>
<P>
   This two-week ordeal was invented a decade ago by Graham
Nickson, a quick-witted, soft-spoken British painter who is the
dean of the school, in order to kick-start his students. But this
summer it seemed far better known outside New York than inside. Few
had come from close by. Many had traveled thousands of miles.
</P>
<P>
   In the studio, I expected to see a single model stretched out on
a piece of cloth. Instead there was a bizarre set inspired by a
Giotto fresco. There were striped and solid awnings held up by four
tall, red wooden posts nailed to a low white platform. The platform
was littered with tables, bottles, bowls, baskets and a dead tree
with boards nailed to its branches and the bottom of its trunk
wrapped in a sheet. On the floor outside the arcade were rivers of
cloth, more baskets and bowls, fruits and onions, pitchers and
trays. And there were three nude models: a thin man sitting on the
platform and leaning against a wooden settee, a tall lanky woman
stretched out on a pillow on her belly and a small blond woman
dozing near the edge of the platform.
</P>
<P>
   This was the scene for the whole week. The models were not going
to move from their poses (except for breaks) and we were not going
to move either. I was stationed between a high school student from
Massachusetts who wondered whether she would ever emerge with a
nice drawing to take home and an Australian man with penchant for
loudly poking his paper with his charcoals and pastels.
</P>
<P>
   The marathon began with charcoal. After a morning of struggle
with the male model's hand and leg and that cursed settee he was
leaning on, it was time for our first critique, or ``crit,'' the
heart of the formal instruction. The drawings were pinned on the
wall. Nickson pointed at them one by one with the tiny red light
from a laser pen. Our moral education was about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   First came the vocabulary. The rectangle is good, a force to be
used, filling in drawings is bad, finding a pathway through
drawings is good, making corrections is good (``When in doubt,
correct''), letting the energy of a drawing evaporate at the edge
of the page is bad, embellishing is bad, democracy (in which figure
is no better than ground) is good, keeping a drawing open is good,
closing it down, or polishing it, is bad, floating figures are bad,
weighty ones are good, perceptual drawing (in which you rely on the
eye) is good, conceptual drawing (relying on presuppositions) is
bad.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing like an architect or carpenter (building a structure and
fitting in objects later) is bad, drawing like you're ticking off a
shopping list of objects is bad, fighting and struggling for a form
is good, engaging in wishful thinking is bad (``This artist is
wishing he was in front of the model''), finding a synergy or
relationship between shapes is good (``that plate is a surrogate
head'') leaving ``footprints in the sand'' where you've traveled is
good, finding caves and lumps in a space is good, Apollonian space
(the one you've reasoned should be there) is bad, Dionysian space
(the one you've stumbled into) is good, desperation is good,
searching is good, Arthur Dove is bad, Matisse is good. Andrew
Wyeth is bad, Degas is good.
</P>
<P>
   In the first crit, I was scorned as a carpenter. I had built a
structure and put objects inside it. I had not yet admitted that
there was a higher power _ the rectangle _ and that I was weak
before it.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, we were made to cut up our drawings into three
vertical segments. I heard the high school student next to me give
a little yelp of resistance. We glued the two ends, severed from
their middle, onto one sheet of paper in their proper places. We
glued the middle section onto the middle of another sheet. In the
remaining hours, we drew in some of the missing passages.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, Nickson asked the crowd of charcoal-stained faces:
``Was this a good idea? Or was it just a funny thing for the end of
the day?'' It wasn't funny. It must have been a good idea. It was a
way for us to think about how the size of the image was related to
the rectangular paper. If you're going to do a large drawing, he
said, you have to keep the unity. You need to see everything in
relational terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is space?'' he asked. The answers came: ``awareness,''
``everything between everything else.'' Nickson had his own
definition: ``Think of negative space as yogurt and then drop a
raspberry into it. The berry doesn't sink. It's held in place by
the yogurt.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning we attacked both drawings with charcoal. And
just when we thought we had them licked, we were told to cut them
in two and swap their top halves. Then we unified the mismatched
drawings square by square, finding pathways, negative spaces,
relations between shapes. Nickson came by and asked, ``Are you
embellishing?'' No, I am too busy confusing the seat of the settee
with its arms.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, we picked up Indian-red pastels and went
through one of the drawings clockwise correcting mistakes. Then we
went over it again with charcoal. Once that drawing was fully
smudged, we started on the other one. We used cerulean blue pastels
to mark out the caves, or deep spaces, and caput mortum, a
brownish-red, to mark out the lumps, or protruding forms. One of
the models went to the hospital with a rash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something happened today that was quite radical,'' Nickson
told us that evening. The room was silent. He asked, ``What
happened?'' And one guy answered: ``We all got suicidal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickson had something else in mind: ``We were forced to correct,
to travel around the rectangle. The reason for walking through the
sections is to make us travel to places we wouldn't think of as
being important.'' So, he asked: ``Why did we cut our drawings? Was
that pure sadism? Let's talk about the act of cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have hurt. It should be meaningful. It's savagery,''
he said. ``What else? Why did we switch the two tops? It gave us
new adventures, new possibilities. Things didn't match up so we had
to correct. Correction is the lifeblood of drawing.''
</P>
<P>
   What about color. ``Was that a chance to embellish? To decorate?
To be optimistic?'' Color was used as scaffolding. Color became
metaphorical. Skin isn't cerulean blue. And that made us aware of
the metaphorical nature of drawing. These are marks on a page.
Color articulates form. It should be democratic in the drawing, all
over the place. The less object-oriented, the less narrative a
drawing is, the better. It is the density of a drawing, the
accumulation of decisions, that gives it its power.
</P>
<P>
   When my drawings went up, they were called ``decorative,''
``architectural,'' and I was accused of coloring in and neglecting
the corners. I was a traitor to perception. Then a ray of hope
shone. This drawing, Nickson generously said, pointing, is
``umbrioco,'' the Italian word for drunk. He said it gave him the
feeling of stumbling through a cubist space.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning we used string and tacks to grid our poor,
overworked pictures into eighths, then 16ths. We wound our way from
square to square, with charcoal, then pastel, then charcoal, then
pastel. My drunken picture turned into a sickening case of delirium
tremens.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon brought fresh white space. We abandoned our easels
and stapled huge sheets, 6 feet by 6 feet, onto the bare walls.
Then we tacked up a big X of string from one corner to another.
``There's a synergy between the corner and the center,'' Nickson
said, ``and you've just found it.'' I had never drawn on such a
large sheet. We made a little square in the center of the sheet,
and that, he explained, would be the module, the small unit of the
big square of paper.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for a five-minute meditation. ``I want you to find
something in the room to be the center of your drawing. Maybe it
will be this onion here.'' We were warned to choose the object
carefully and not to waste any space. ``I've seen it happen,'' he
said. The center should be the raison d'etre of the drawing.
</P>
<P>
   I was quickly drawn to the darkest spot in the setup: where the
lanky model's buttocks met the negative space between her legs. But
that seemed too risky as a raison d'etre, so I went for a small
flaw on the trunk of the dead tree. Two seconds later, I had
trouble locating it again. The next 20 minutes were to be devoted
to sketching the corners with charcoal. I spent them regretting my
decision. The spot kept shifting.
</P>
<P>
   That night at the crit, Nickson's quiet observations about our
being ``on a journey with no idea of what the destination was going
to be'' were overcome by loud claps of thunder outside. And our
pictures on the wall, which he had compared and contrasted with
drawings by Gauguin, Seurat, Degas, Bonnard, Giacometti, Vuillard,
Masaccio, Derain, El Greco and Ingres, were upstaged by the
lightning. The snakes, clouds, sunbursts and deer molded in low
relief on the ceiling were illuminated, and the fireplace,
whimsically decorated with plaster flames, came alive. Buckets of
rain came down outside. The leaves were a lurid green. The casement
windows slammed shut with the wind. ``What do we think of this
drawing?'' Nickson asked. ``Or are we too captivated by the rain?''
He had lost us.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning brought a deep funk. We were to go back into
our big drawings using cerulean blue, concentrating on square-foot
sections. Next we cut up squares of paper and pasted them onto our
drawings to map out a pathway. The squares of white were supposed
to open up our drawings.
</P>
<P>
   One of the students compared the marathon to a Buddhist retreat.
Some Buddhist teachers, she said, ``will get you up at 4 in the
morning to do an hour of prostration and then sit still.'' We had
tasks, too. We were asked to cut up our pictures, shift the whole
drawing over six inches every few minutes, or correct one another's
pictures for two-hour stints. That kind of thing, she said,
``pushes you over the edge of your usual behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon brought no relief from the relentless cut and
paste. We glued more squares on the hollows and hills in the
drawing, more squares on the apexes closest to us. ``It's like
going in and dropping supplies to the army,'' Nickson explained. I
ran out of hollows and hills and started gluing squares over the
sections that I hated. I heard someone across the room moan, ``Are
we just going to be broken down, and broken down and broken down?''
</P>
<P>
   The evening proved fateful. Nickson showed us the pentimenti,
the ghost traces left from an erasure, in a picture. He clearly
admired the space they had created and the honesty they indicated.
Mistakes were made. Mistakes were corrected. The word pentimenti,
he explained, comes from the Italian world for repent. ``If you
make a mark you thought was honest and you find it wasn't, then you
repent, and the mark that's left is a sign of your repentance.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Lord, I have sinned.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, we went back into the caves of our picture with blue
and climbed the hills with caput mortum. I struggled desperately to
be honest. But honestly, things kept shifting. The table leg was
behind the tree, then it wasn't. A little cave that was definitely
there suddenly vanished. An onion turned into an orange. The arm of
the settee was pointing right into the man's head, then it was a
few inches away. My god, even the raison d'etre of my drawing, that
damn spot on the tree, wouldn't stay still for me.
</P>
<P>
   Finally I was saved. One of the full-time students pointed out
that my perspective kept changing because I was climbing on a chair
to reach the top part of the drawing, ducking down to reach the
bottom and wandering back and forth to get to the edges. To keep
everything still, you have to keep coming back to the same spot to
look, and then memorize where you want to make your mark.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the world stopped reeling. I heard the happy scraping
of charcoal and pastel all around me. I heard a woman fall off her
ladder from sheer concentration. I heard one man yell at another
for tampering with the setup. I didn't care. The world had stopped
spinning. Everything was exactly where I thought it was. And I went
in with my charcoal to do some heavy repenting.

 &HT;    DeBerg thinks experience in NFL will be on his side
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sports-talk radio stations from coast to coast were
buzzing Tuesday about 44-year-old Steve DeBerg signing with the
Atlanta Falcons and supplanting Warren Moon as the oldest player in
the NFL. But DeBerg, showing a sense of humor, took it all in
stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire Warren, but he's a young guy,'' said DeBerg, a
17-year veteran who on Tuesday threw a handful of passes during the
Falcons' mandatory mini-camp. ``There's a lot to (the idea that the
NFL favors such older quarterbacks as Moon and Super Bowl champion
John Elway, 37).
</P>
<P>
   ``Defenses have gotten so advanced it takes more just to
understand what you can and can't do,'' DeBerg said. ``I would bet
I can be more productive this year than the two quarterbacks
drafted first (No. 1 pick Peyton Manning of Indianapolis, and No. 2
Ryan Leaf of San Diego). The learning curve is so steep.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg is expected to back up starting quarterback Chris
Chandler and tutor second-year QB Tony Graziani or rookie free
agent Brian Brennan. They're the quarterbacks in camp now that
would-be backup Mark Rypien is all but certain not to join the team
in time for training camp on July 23. Rypien, signed earlier by the
Falcons, is dealing with serious health problems suffered by his
wife and son. Coach Dan Reeves said one of the three backups will
be cut.
</P>
<P>
   After splitting 1993 between Tampa Bay and Miami, DeBerg coached
quarterbacks in 1995-96 under Reeves with the Giants. When he
didn't get a coaching job last year, he began working out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It began as a way to get in shape,'' said DeBerg, who was
called by radio call-in shows around the country Tuesday, chiefly
in cities where he played -- San Francisco, Tampa Bay and Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't doing much, other than being 43, retired, and having
my share of fun. I did a lot of throwing into nets, a lot of
running and leg weight work, and it went from there,'' DeBerg said.
``As a coach, you prepare so much more. I began studying throwing
technique, because I had to explain it. I learned a lot about quick
release, power and accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg knew nothing about the illnesses in the Rypien family
when he went looking for tryouts last month. First, he called Tampa
Bay. Next, he called Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I know Dan (for whom he played in Denver 1981-83), I
told him what I was thinking, and he told me they weren't sure what
was going to happen with Ryp,'' DeBerg said. ``I called back the
next day and asked if it would be OK if I drove up (from Tampa) and
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, DeBerg signed a one-year deal. If DeBerg makes the
Falcons, Moon, who starts for Seattle, will become the
second-oldest player in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I just love throwing footballs,'' DeBerg said. ``Maybe
my arm isn't as strong as it was, but my release is quicker, and my
mechanics are better. I got out of the huddle fine today.
Everything seemed to be moving kind of fast, but it will slow down.
I wouldn't be here if I couldn't do it.''

   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons convened Tuesday in Suwanee for
the team's three-day mini-camp, and veterans underwent physicals
and were tested for their ``power output'' and general conditioning
before participating in a one-hour practice.
</P>
<P>
   Players loathed the conditioning test, where they had to run ten
40-yard dashes, all within 10 percent of their top time, with a
20-second rest between each. But the mood was upbeat, considering
the rarity of a mandatory mini-camp so close to the July 23 start
of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves said there's a reason for that schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Players are ending a 16-week stretch of voluntary _ but heavily
encouraged _ conditioning work. Teams used to go straight from
mini-camp to training camp. But a couple of years ago, a new rule
in the collective-bargaining agreement specified that veterans must
have 10 days off immediately before training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 10-day moratorium, from my perspective, is one of the
worst things they've done,'' Reeves said. ``It takes a long time to
get in shape, but you can get out of shape real quick. We have the
mini-camp now, and do these tests so guys can see where they are.
Some will see they need to get in even better shape. Some veterans
will do nothing (in the 10 off days), and that 16 weeks can go to
waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-eight of 81 players were present Tuesday. Starting right
guard Gene Williams, punter Dan Stryzinski and backup quarterback
Mark Rypien were excused for personal reasons. . . . After they
signedreserve quarterback Steve DeBerg, the Falcons waived
free-agent kicker David Akers to remain at the NFL's limit of 80
players under contract. . . . Third-round draft choice Jammi
German, a wide receiver from Miami, remains the only one of nine
draftees still unsigned. Atlanta will have to waive another player
when German signs. German's agent, Alan Wade of Memphis, is asking
for a larger signing bonus than the Falcons are offering. The bonus
will be in the vicinity of $365,000, and the contract, probably for
three years, will be worth nearly $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons suffered no serious injuries Tuesday, although
cornerback Ray Buchanan tweaked a hamstring while running 40s;
German is fighting a sore ankle. . . . General manager Harold
Richardson had informal talks with Frank Bauer, the agent for
quarterback Chris Chandler, about a contract extension, but nothing
is imminent. Chandler, 32, is entering the last year of his
contract, and both sides say they would like an extension. . . .
The mandatory portion of mini-camp ends Thursday, but the team will
have a voluntary passing camp Friday morning, the last formal
gathering before training camp. Rookies will remain in Suwanee
right up to camp. . . . Former lineman Keith Loneker, who was in
camp with the Falcons last summer before being cut, has a small
role in the George Clooney movie, ``Out of Sight.'' Loneker, who
was on the Rams, plays a bodyguard.

ADMINISTRATION TO ALLOW LIMITED DATA-SCRAMBLING EXPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JERI CLAUSING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a small concession to the American software and
financial industries, the Clinton administration announced Tuesday
that it would for the first time allow the export of strong
data-scrambling software without any promises of back-door access
for law enforcement _ but only for banks and financial institutions
in 45 nations that have acceptable money-laundering laws.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement marks a victory of sorts for a faction within
the administration that favors unrestrained encryption as a way of
protecting personal privacy and encouraging the growth of the
Internet as an engine of new electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Another faction backs FBI director Louis Freeh, who has demanded
that police agencies be given software ``keys'' that could, with a
court order, unlock scrambled messages, much as they can now get
permission to tap a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement represented only a small step in what has
for the last year been a deadlock in negotiations between the
government and the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   The industry argues that foreign software makers will get the
upper hand if American companies are not allowed to export strong
encryption _ that is, software that scrambles data so thoroughly
that it would require a supercomputer and at least several weeks to
decipher, if the code could be cracked at all.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley announced the new guidelines in
a speech to an exporters conference here. He presented the change
in the rules as an expansion of last year's decision to allow
special treatment for encryption products that are used to secure
financial communications and transactions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, while admitting that current export controls
are stifling the ability of American companies to compete globally,
Daley said that the administration was still at least months away
from reaching any consensus on the broader issues of encryption
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that make software for financial institutions were
pleased by the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretary Daley's statement appears to represent a very
favorable shift in administration policy,'' said Tara Sexton, a
spokeswoman for IBM. ``As the world's largest exporter of security
solutions to international banks and financial institutions, we
have been urging such a shift for some time, and this seems to be a
key step in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But a coalition of software companies, privacy groups and others
fighting for an across-the-board lifting of export controls on
encryption called the policy shift insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't support this piecemeal approach,'' said Sue Richards,
a spokeswoman for Americans for Computer Privacy. `` We support the
lifting of all export restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   American companies now must get a permit from the Commerce
Department to export anything but the most rudimentary encryption
products. To qualify, companies must have a plan for creating
law-enforcement keys.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Export
Administration announced that it would ease the restrictions on
products used by financial institutions. But it still required that
companies exporting strong encryption have a plan for developing
law-enforcement keys, and export licenses are issued on a
case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, which are expected to take effect later
this summer, the Commerce Department has done away with the spare
key and licensing requirements, meaning that the products will only
need a one-time review before they can be exported to financial
institutions that have their headquarters in any of the 45
qualifying nations. Eligible countries are either members of an
international anti-money-laundering accord or have enacted
anti-money-laundering laws.
</P>
<P>
   Once they receive approval, the institutions will be allowed to
share the technology with branches worldwide, except with those in
terrorist states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action gives our nation's financial institutions the
flexibility they need to remain globally competitive,'' Daley said.
``Importantly, it balances those needs with law enforcement,
national security and foreign policy concerns. Through steps like
this we can continue to encourage the development of an electronic
commerce system users can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Daley conceded that the administration's attempts to
control encryption had failed, and he chastised both the FBI and
the software industry for refusing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there has been some progress, according to Daley.
``There's certainly been more discussion and movement and
understanding than there surely was in April,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others involved in the negotiations, however, said that little
progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Several bills pending in Congress would lift the export controls
and ban any attempts to require law enforcement keys.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's encryption policy has also been the subject
of several lawsuits by college professors who have been restricted
from posting encryption codes on the Internet as part of their
course tools. And decisions in those cases are as divided as the
administration and the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a federal judge in Ohio ruled against a professor at
Case Western Reserve University Law School, who argued that the
posting of his programs was protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling contradicts one earlier this year by a federal judge
in California, who ruled in the case of a University of Illinois
math professor that computer source code is protected by the First
Amendment. &QL;

THROUGH THE EYES OF A CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 12.)  
 (JT ) 
 By WILL JOYNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 6-year-old boy tries to protect his mother as she is thrown
around a tiny apartment by a charismatic crook posing as an army
officer in the Soviet Union of the early 1950s. An 11-year-old girl
discovers her mother sitting with self-inflicted wounds in the
basement of their western Massachusetts house one afternoon in
1963, a few hours after the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy. An 8-year-old girl serves as a shrewd translator for her
deaf parents as they appeal to a bank worker for a loan in the
prosperous Germany of the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these scenes is from a movie in theaters now or about to
be, and each is from a movie intended primarily for adults. More
important, each is indicative of a prominent tendency among
thoughtful filmmakers these days to present insights about
complicated adult situations through the consciousnesses and mouths
of near-babes rather than of jaded midlifers, dreamy Gen-X drifters
or renegade teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Placing the pre- or early-adolescent point of view in the thick
of sophisticated conflict has a venerable cinematic past, of course
_ think of Truffaut's ``400 Blows'' and Spielberg's ``E.T.'' And
its practical esthetic appeal is a compelling one that's not so
difficult to decipher: the pre- or early adolescent is old enough
to be both perceptive witness and provocative participant yet young
enough not to have retreated fully behind the blinkers of
self-contemplation and social convention. What's striking, though,
is not only the number of new films centered on such characters _
the movies mentioned above, respectively, ``The Thief,'' ``Home
Before Dark'' and ``Beyond Silence,'' come directly on the heels of
``Lawn Dogs,'' ``The Butcher Boy'' and ``Mendel'' in the spring and
``Eve's Bayou'' and ``My Life in Pink'' last winter. What's also
striking is the refinement with which the approach is being used.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Thief,'' a recent best-foreign-film Oscar nominee from
Russia that opens in American theaters on July 17, Sanya (Misha
Philipchuk) is a shyly charming 6-year-old with his own distinct
set of tics and fears. But with a virtual absence of contrivance,
the director and screenwriter, Pavel Chukhrai, has him personify
nothing less than the entire Russian people under Stalin as well.
</P>
<P>
   During a period of great national dislocation, Sanya's mother,
Katya (Yekaterina Rednikova), latches on to Tolyan (Vladimir
Mashkov), a hard, handsome man who she thinks is a soldier and will
be an effective provider. Sanya is haunted by indistinct visions of
his real father, a good soldier now dead who appears to him asking,
``Will you avenge me?'' As the boy resists, then idolizes, then
sees through the interloper Tolyan, the lessons of ``The Thief'' _
like many of the lessons of childhood itself, when thought back
upon _ seem intimate and historically vast at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same is true of Alexander Rosler's ``Mendel,'' which is
about a German-Jewish family that moves to Norway in 1954. The
title character is a 9-year-old boy who has been kept in the dark
concerning the Holocaust; he doesn't know the details of what
happened to the many relatives his parents speak of only in
whispers. But as he detects how unsettling the move to Norway is
for his parents and older brother, and senses the reasons for this,
he becomes a kind of provocateur. Forcing them to reveal the
specifics of their family's loss and their notion of Jewishness,
Mendel comes to represent the challenge of articulating and
maintaining postwar Jewish identity, a large subject indeed.
</P>
<P>
   More often, the children at the heart of this sort of film are
agents of emotional truth in the face of smaller if timeless adult
realities like middle-class complacency, adultery, alcoholism,
madness and alienation related to illness or physical disability.
They are walking and talking, often infuriating reminders of the
way things should be, or could be, if the world weren't what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, this truth-telling status _ and the darker side of
the human condition _ is fulfilled with a loss of innocence. In
Neil Jordan's ``Butcher Boy,'' for example, the 12-year-old Francie
Brady (memorably played by a newcomer, Eamon Owens) echoes the
disintegration of each of his parents in a small Irish town by
disintegrating himself, and carrying out an appalling act of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the truth-teller, on a more hopeful note, courageously
maintains or restores reason and order. In Maureen Foley's ``Home
Before Dark,'' which opened on Friday, 11-year-old Nora reacts to
her mother's suicide attempt on the day of the Kennedy
assassination by refusing to let anyone not face the facts. In
Caroline Link's ``Beyond Silence,'' another recent Oscar nominee,
young Lara balances care for her deaf parents with her musical
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it's telling that these movies are not, strictly
speaking, coming-of-age narratives. The point is usually not that
the central child is gaining knowledge that will make him or her
more like us adults, but that the child is still in touch with a
manner of understanding largely lost to us. Perhaps that's what
makes these films _ some of which are fully realized, some of which
are not _ seem more essential than so much of what's on view today.
They let us look at ourselves with an acuity we'd love to recover
for good.

NIGERIAN LEADER ABIOLA COLLAPSES, DIES IN PRISON

<TEXT>
<P>
   Moshood Abiola, the millionaire executive who was seen as
winning the 1993 Nigerian presidential election, collapsed and died
during a meeting with Nigerian and visiting US officials Tuesday,
just hours before he was expected to be released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, who suffered cardiac arrest, was rushed from the meeting
and died at a hospital in the capital, Abuja, the government said.
But the timing of the death _ a month after the death by heart
attack of his archrival, dictator Sani Abacha _ raised suspicions
of foul play.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected death prompted looting and violence in parts of
Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital. Young people ran through the
streets, shouting that Abiola had been murdered. The government
cordoned off Abiola's house in Lagos and put police on alert, but
the disturbances subsided by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   After General Abacha's sudden death, in recent days US officials
and Nigerian democracy activists had pinned their hopes on Abiola,
who was 60, for a peaceful transition in the troubled country. When
Abiola declared himself president in 1994, after the military
regime annulled the election, he was imprisoned alone in a dark
cell and blocked from contact with doctors and family members,
despite his history of high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting with Abacha's successor, General Abdulsalam
Abubakar, last week, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said Abiola
and dozens of other political prisoners would be freed. Abiola had
been kept secluded with only a Bible and the Koran to read but was
``physically fit and mentally alert,'' Annan said. In fact, he
said, Abiola was so cut off from the world that he thought former
UN secretary general Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who left the post
nearly two years ago, was still running the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had only been informed that he was going to meet a very
important man,'' Annan said Tuesday. ```Who are you?,''' he asked
Annan. ```What happened to the Egyptian?'''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, for the first time since he was detained four years
ago, Abiola was allowed to see American officials, including
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, the State Department's
third-highest-ranking official.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard that he started coughing and wheezing and he died''
when rushed to a hospital, his daughter, Hafsat Abiola, said by
telephone from her home in suburban Maryland. As an undergraduate
at Harvard University, she had campaigned for the release of her
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a strong suspicion that this is foul play _ it is just
too coincidental,'' said Abiola, 23, who graduated last year and
has crisscrossed the country speaking to college audiences about
human rights in her homeland, the world's most populous black
nation. ``No matter what happened, the military bears full
responsibility because of the way they treated him ... and he was
in their custody.''
</P>
<P>
   Moshood Abiola's wife, Kudirat, who also campaigned for his
release, was shot dead two years ago in Lagos in a crime that many
in the family attribute to the dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola earned a fortune in publishing and other businesses. He
was not beloved by all Nigerians, but almost everyone in the
country said that he had handily won the elections before they were
annulled. The military government clamped down on the press and
political parties, executed opponents and jailed labor leaders,
journalists, students, environmentalists, and others without
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just stunning news and all of us who know Nigeria well
are shocked,'' said Peter M. Lewis, a professor of international
relations at American University and co-author of ``Stabilizing
Nigeria.'' ``There's a great risk that most Nigerians will not
believe that what happened was spontaneous and a result of natural
causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the Clinton administration exacerbated Nigeria's
problems by not consistently denouncing the dictatorship or fully
embracing grass-roots democracy movements. Although the US Agency
for International Development had a $3 million budget for helping
democracy groups in the country last year, only 10 percent of the
money was distributed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, President Clinton said he was ``deeply
saddened'' by Abiola's death and urged the country to move toward
democracy. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Abiola ``had
become the symbol of democracy in Nigeria.'' Statements by the US
and British government did not suggest any hint of foul play, but a
State Department official said the timing of the heart attack
appeared to be ``pretty suspicious.'' Still, there is no
information that indicates a homicide, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By Muslim custom, Abiola should be buried Wednesday and no
autopsy should be allowed. But Abiola's children demanded an
autopsy and the government ordered one Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``We'd be glad to see an autopsy ... because of all the
rumors going around about the cause of Abiola's death,'' said Janet
Fleishman, who monitors Africa for Human Rights Watch in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch and other nongovernmental groups in the
United States and Africa said the military must honor a pledge to
hold elections in August and surrender power peacefully in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the government will make good on its pledge to release
all remaining political prisoners, unconditionally, and to define a
credible process for the democratic transition to civilian rule
within a reasonable time frame,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the American University professor, said the military
government is split between hard-liners who want to crack down and
reformers who want to allow civilians to rule. He predicted that
unrest will grow as frustrated Nigerians demand an investigation
into Abiola's death. ``This death creates a pall of uncertainty,''
he said. ``If there are riots in the streets, that will strengthen
the hand of the hard-liners.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the military, Nigeria's political opposition movement is
divided and debating what to do next, said Margaret Vogt, a
Nigerian scholar at the International Peace Academy in New York.
``The Nigerian people didn't vote for Abiola because he was so
good, they voted for change, and Abiola symbolized that change,''
Vogt said. ``Now, the pressure for change will be stronger.''

CROATIAN COACH HAS SEEN IT ALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France __ Miroslav Blazevic has seen much in his 63
years, everything from a war that tore his homeland asunder to the
inside of a jail cell in which he was housed in the wake of his
sport's most notorious scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Few expected him to see what his Croatian side has achieved the
past weeks, rising seemingly from nowhere to grab a spot in
tonight's World Cup semifinal against France at the Stade de
France. The colorful Blazevic wasn't among them.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he'd been tipped off to the Croats' imminent success
before the Cup began. Superstitious, tempermental and with an
unerring faith in astrology, Blazevic was informed by his
astrologer that his squad would progress far in its first World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   He also was told he might have a heart attack while sitting on
the bench during the competition. If it comes tonight, or in
Sunday's final, he's sure to exit this world as happy as a man can
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was convinced we were ready for something big in France,''
said Blazevic, known as ``Ciro'' at home. ``Croatian players are
the most gifted in Europe. They are the Brazilians of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   With a gendarme's hat in one hand and a burning cigarette in the
other, Blazevic has been the surprise success in France, guiding a
team that few saw capable of contending for the crown to the brink
of winning it.
</P>
<P>
   He's done so by instilling confidence in his players, by taking
a group of talented individuals --- including millionaires Davor
Suker (Real Madrid), Zvonimir Boban (AC Milan), Aljosa Asanovic
(Napoli), Robert Jarni (Real Betis), Goran Vlaovic (Valencia) and
Slaven Bilic (Everton) --- and molding them into a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``His secret is that he has an inner-communication with the
players,'' said Branko Miksa, the president of Croatia's soccer
federation. ``He is like a psychologist; he understands the
players' psyche and he has a great knowledge of football. He is
able to combine the two to achieve these results.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't always been so revered. He spent two weeks in a French
jail after being implicated in the Olympique Marseille match-fixing
scandal --- he was never charged --- and Croatian fans were calling
for his head after a controversial quarterfinal loss to Germany in
the 1996 European Championship, and again after a difficult road
through qualifying for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   His friendship with Croatian president Franjo Tudjman helped him
keep control, and after struggles in its early Cup games --- wins
over Jamaica and Japan and a loss to Argentina --- his squad has
come on in the knockout phase, beating Romania and playing a
brilliant tactical game to upset Germany in the quarterfinals. Now
his players believe they can win it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Blazevic told us two years ago that we were the best in
the world, we all laughed,'' Bilic said after the win over Germany.
``We are laughing less and less now. ... I'm not saying we're going
to be champions, but now we have a good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Blazevic never doubted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few people gave us a chance of getting to the semifinals, but
I've always had this feeling we could go further,'' he said.
``Personally, I am far too ambitious to be happy with what we have
achieved so far. I want to go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Blazevic, who coached French club Nantes as well as teams in
Croatia, Yugoslavia and Switzerland, carries with him the
gendarme's cap, or ``kepi,'' in honor of Daniel Nivel, the Lens
policeman beaten by German thugs after a first-round match last
month. ``The local gendarme chief gave it to me,'' he explained.
``He wanted me to keep it with me to bring luck to (Nivel).''
</P>
<P>
   It has also brought luck to the Croats. Not that they needed
any.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a surprise,'' he said, ``only for people who are
ignorant.''

NIGERIAN LEADER ABIOLA COLLAPSES, DIES IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Moshood Abiola, the millionaire executive who was seen as
winning the 1993 Nigerian presidential election, collapsed and died
during a meeting with Nigerian and visiting US officials Tuesday,
just hours before he was expected to be released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, who suffered cardiac arrest, was rushed from the meeting

<P>
   ABILENE, Texas _ For Daniel Shumate, a 32-year-old parolee, it's
another chance to get his life on track. For Melissa Bolton, 23 and
also a parolee, it's an opportunity to show that a woman can handle
heavy work in the oilfields. For Ruben Garza, 20, it's a way to
break out of toiling at minimum wage. And for Ben Hilgreth, 21, a
college student, it's a way to build up a stake that he can use to
invest.
</P>
<P>
   While their goals vary, these four share a single dream: to make
it in one of the most physically demanding, dangerous and at times
technically challenging jobs around _ being a ``roughneck,'' or
laborer, on an oil rig.
</P>
<P>
   Dripping with sweat, their clothes stained with grease and dirt,
their bodies aching from wrestling with equipment weighing hundreds
of pounds, they struggled recently to develop the skills and
endurance needed for that life. The site was a school for
roughnecks here, run by the Texas Engineering Extension Service,
part of Texas A &AMP; M University.
</P>
<P>
   With starting pay of $9 to $13 an hour, and with shifts that can
last 12 hours _ a typical schedule is 14 days on, 14 days off _ a
worker can eventually make over $200 a day working on an offshore
platform.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone in this class of eight, becoming a ``weevil,'' as
new workers are called, would be a big step up the economic ladder.
That is why they gave it their all in this monthlong class.
</P>
<P>
   The school reopened in early April after closing four years ago,
a victim of a boom that fizzled when oil prices hit bottom in the
late 1980s. That boom left such a glut of workers that for years
new opportunities in the field were almost nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   When prices strengthened several years ago, though, oil service
companies suddenly found that a whole generation of workers had
vanished, and have been scrambling ever since to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   So while oil prices have again fallen, hitting a nine-year low
last month, the underlying need for new blood is so strong that
there is still a healthy demand for all kinds of workers _ from
starting laborers, or ``roustabouts,'' to chemical engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s, we lost an entire generation,'' said Gary Lee,
vice president for human resources at Grey Wolf Drilling. ``There
is still a shortage of good skilled people.''
</P>
<P>
   This profession has been so volatile that even though Garza and
two other graduates have gotten jobs, history seems to suggest that
their budding careers could vanish at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lee, though, many industry executives argue that it may be
different this time _ that even if oil prices stay low, or drop
more, the pool of skilled workers has shrunk so far that the labor
shortage will persist for at least several years.
</P>
<P>
   And even though smaller independent drillers have cut back, most
larger oil companies are holding firm. They are in the midst of
bringing large fields into production, projects that make economic
sense despite unexpectedly low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the industry can withstand lower prices is that
rapidly advancing technology brings down the cost and risks of
finding oil.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how high-tech it gets, though, the industry still
needs strong workers who can take the punishing 12-hour shifts and
stay mentally alert. For they play a crucial role in bringing to
surface the vast amounts of oil and natural gas needed to supply
the 74 million barrels a day the world now consumes.
</P>
<P>
   Thus recruiters still come to the roughneck school to interview
potential trainees.
</P>
<P>
   New recruits could end up on rigs in the deserts of Kazakhstan,
where temperatures range from 40 below in winter to 110 in summer,
living in isolated barracks for a month at a time and then having a
month back home. Or they could toil two weeks at a time on
platforms in the North Sea, where storms send huge waves crashing
into the concrete and steel structures.
</P>
<P>
   Most get their start with smaller independent companies, then
try to move to the majors, where jobs can be steadier and
opportunities for advancement more numerous.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the industry had plenty of experienced roughnecks.
Though benefits and pensions were rare, the pay was high.
</P>
<P>
   But ``when the drilling stops, they're through with you,'' said
Dennis Hooper, an instructor at the school who started to work as a
roughneck when he was 15. He has seen boom and bust many times in
his 54 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, a big drop in oil prices led to an almost decade-long
retrenchment by oil companies. Tens of thousands of workers were
forced to find other jobs or move away. Many were plunged into
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   By the time oil prices recovered and a sustained drilling boom
took off, the pool of skilled labor had largely evaporated. ``The
contractors themselves have caused this,'' Hooper said, since
little effort was made to keep skilled workers in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of good entry-level workers has caused many drilling
companies to begin their own training programs, and even offer
benefits like health insurance and 401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many companies now send more veteran managers into the
field to supervise workers. Green workers, executives said, are
prone to make mistakes while learning a variety of tasks, from
painting and scraping to handling expensive equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' said Michael V. Ronca, president and chief
executive of the Domain Energy Corporation, a medium-size Houston
independent that does a lot of drilling and exploration in the
United States and the Gulf of Mexico. ``We have to send our
experienced people to baby-sit.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after extensive training, roughnecks ``don't know what they
are doing sometimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One time, he recalled, a worker was unable to turn off the water
and ended up flooding equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Suppliers can fall short too, he said, recalling that Domain
recently had to ship back 34,000 feet of defective pipe _ pipe that
had passed four sets of inspectors.

WIFE OF BEATEN BLACK REJECTS POLICE FINDING

<P>
   LAWRENCE, Mass. _ Although Charles L. Love's wife says he was
the victim of a racial attack July 4, police have told prosecutors
they no longer believe the assault was racially motivated but
stemmed from a disagreement between two families over drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy Love, who is white, says Jeffrey Klier and two of his
relatives, all white, yelled racial slurs as they beat her black
husband in front Klier's Lawrence home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would they say, (the slurs) if they were not prejudiced in
some way?'' asked Brandy Love, 50, of Methuen. ``This has nothing
to with drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Brandy Love told investigators her 44-year-old
husband was beaten by the three men with baseball bats who
shattered his jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Love, a native of Jasper, Texas, where a black man was
allegedly dragged to death by three white supremacists last month,
was in stable condition at Lawrence General Hospital with his jaw
wired shut.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Klier, 44, of Lawrence has been charged with attempted
murder and violating Love's civil rights. Authorities are looking
for the other alleged attackers, including Klier's son.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Klier was being held in lieu of $75,000 bail. A
spokesman for the Essex County Distict Attorney's office said Klier
has a criminal record going back to 1972, including six convictions
for assault, and three for breaking and entering, but none for
civil rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence police Capt. Michael Molchan said police have told
prosecutors they do not think the July 4 attack was a racial.
Molchan said the assault on Love came about after Klier lost a
fight ``over drugs'' to two of Love's relatives earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The families have known one another for more than 12 years,
Brandy Love said.
</P>
<P>
   Molchan said Lawrence police are leaving the decision on whether
to continue charging Klier with civil right violations up to the
district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is up to them whether they will go forward on those charges
or not,'' said Molchan.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen O'Connell, a spokesman for the district attorney's
office, said Tuesday prosecutors have not decided whether to press
the civil rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still checking into the cause of the dispute,'' said
O'Connell.
</P>
<P>
   Molchan said that investigators have determined that after
losing the fight at the Loves' Chase Street house in Methuen, Klier
went home, enlisted some relatives and returned to Love's home,
damaging property there.
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Brandy Love then went to Klier's home, about a half
mile away, to find out what was wrong and Charles was attacked when
he got out of his car, police said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brandy Love tells a different story.
</P>
<P>
   She said she and her husband, who have lived in Methuen for 14
years, were holding a barbeque to celebrate their 20th wedding
anniversary when Klier and two other men showed up in a car,
circling the Loves' block and yelling racial slurs.
</P>
<P>
   Klier and the others left and the Loves decided to go to the
Klier house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to find out what was going on,'' said Brandy Love.
</P>
<P>
   She said her husband got out of the car in Lawrence and started
talking to Jeffrey Klier, when Charles was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to kill him and then they turned on me,''
said Brandy Love. She said Jeffrey Klier chased her to her car, and
broke all the windows out before he ran away when he heard police
sirens.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Klier's 20-year-old son, also named Jeffrey, gave yet
another version of the attack. He said his father got his nose
bloodied and face swollen in an earlier assault by Love's step son
and another man over a drug dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Klier, who is being sought by police, denied his
father went back to the Love's home but said later in the day
Charles and Brandy Love came to the Klier home and Charles Love
exited his car, brandished a knife and said: `` `We have a problem
here? Let's take care of it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is no angel,'' the younger Jeffery Klier said, ``but
he's not prejudiced.''

 UNDATED: of inspectors. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though the jobs basically take brawn and endurance, one
cannot just walk off the street and become a roughneck. Working a
drill rig takes teamwork and coordination, with even simple jobs on
platforms, like cleaning and painting, involving an element of
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Davis, who runs the school and coordinates its safety
program, told one class that in Alaska the decks of offshore
platforms are about 150 feet above the freezing water, with
currents often running at 30 to 40 knots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you fall off,'' he said, ``they've got five minutes to get
you.''
</P>
<P>
   He also warns students about hydrogen sulfide, a highly
poisonous gas that smells like rotten eggs. When released in
drilling, it can quickly overcome workers and, in high
concentrations, even kill them if they don't make a quick exit or
don a protective mask.
</P>
<P>
   And Davis repeatedly stressed the importance of teamwork. ``It
takes a while to fit in with everybody,'' Hooper stressed. ``If
you're in a crew that doesn't know what they are doing, it gets
pretty tense.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the trainees did not finish the course because they
found the adjustment difficult, he said, adding, ``You have to have
that grit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bolton seemed to have it. After several weeks, she was able
to maneuver huge wrench-like tools that weigh 500 pounds. During a
training session, amid the roar of motorized drill bits and
winches, she moved them smoothly just in time to tighten and loosen
drilling pipe.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months ago, she recalled, she was working as a
nursing-home aide for $4.35 an hour. When her parole officer told
her she could learn the trade that her father and brother made
their living at, she jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bolton, her brown hair gathered into a ponytail under her
hard hat, worked quietly and comfortably with the young men on the
rig, training herself for the rigors ahead.
</P>
<P>
   She realized she would have a harder time proving she is up to
the challenge. ``They wonder, `Can she do it?''' she said. ``It
just makes me want to prove more that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilgreth, a wiry University of Texas student, was attracted by
the numerous ads offering jobs, but, when he called, found that
everyone wanted experienced people. He decided to quit college for
a while and come to the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make enough to invest in something,'' he said,
taking quick drags on a cigarette during a lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   With oil prices dropping again, the bloom of the upturn has
begun to fade. Rates for drilling rigs have begun to fall as
smaller companies have cut back. Wells that made sense to drill
when oil was $18 to $20 a barrel do not at the recent $13 to $14.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Smith, an assistant drilling superintendent for Key
Energy, a local drilling contractor, had all his 32 rigs working
earlier this year. To attract reliable, skilled workers, his
company raised the basic starting wage from $9.35 an hour in
November to $12.35 and began offering 401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   The recent decline in oil prices, however, has caused him to
mothball about half the rigs.
</P>
<P>
   And other smaller companies have begun to lay off workers as
they shut down less productive wells.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that most smaller independent oil companies were
waiting to see what happened on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries in Vienna last month, leading oil-producing nations like
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela were able to put together cuts of 1.4
million barrels a day. Combined with cuts from non-OPEC countries
like Mexico and Norway, this has led to total reductions of close
to 3 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how far these cuts will go in helping oil prices
recover because demand may also fall because of recessions in big
oil-importing nations like Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like puppets on a string,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, so are the graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, strapping at 6 foot 2, has just started working with a
crew near Laredo, Tex., for Grey Wolf Drilling. He is working
12-hour shifts, from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., seven days straight. He
earns $10 an hour, but after 40 hours in a week, he gets the $15
overtime rate. When he is working, he lives in a six-bunk trailer
with 10 other workers in the middle of a desolate area, often
battered by wind-borne dust, where temperatures can reach 110
degrees. About the only diversion is satellite television.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, he often does the simple tasks, like fetching
wrenches, tying cables and using his powerful arms to lock down
nuts and bolts. His concern is whether this job will last.
</P>
<P>
   Recently some of his co-workers were laid off, but he was kept
on because of his training.
</P>
<P>
   For Daniel Shumate, who had been driving a cement truck for $8
an hour _ not enough to enable him to own a car _ the school is his
chance to ``make it into the middle bracket.'' After waiting for a
over a month and a half he just landed a job Tuesday with an oil
well service company starting at $6.25 an hour and has several
prospects to work on an offshore platform at much higher pay.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to make it since if things don't work out:
``I'm back to square one.''

AS ZIDANE GOES, SO GOES FRANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ The impoverished neighborhood that sits in
the shadows of the Stade de France is home to several thousand of
the 3 million Algerians who call France home.
</P>
<P>
   The futuristic stadium, the crowning glory of this World Cup,
has done little for them but illuminate the hardship they must
endure. It has brought new taxes to Paris' most depressed
industrial suburb and few benefits, instead offering a rich
contrast between how France envisions itself --- a modern land,
looking to the future --- and the reality of its poor, its
insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooking the poorest quarter of Saint-Denis is Zinedine
Zidane, standing six stories tall. His face stares out from a
towering adidas ad, but it's much more than a means to sell shoes.
To the people here, especially the Algerians, it's as if God
himself were looking down on them, watching over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are like Zidane --- before he had money,'' explains
a woman, working the counter at one of perhaps a dozen Algerian
restaurants between the Periphique, the freeway that encircles
Paris, and the stadium. ``He is so close to our feelings, he
represents us. From here we can hear the crowd, but we can watch
only on the TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when Zizou is playing, I feel more French than the
French.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a role Zidane neither relishes nor refuses, but his
abilities with a soccer ball --- like a wizard's, or a magician's
--- his vision and his intelligence has clearly marked him as the
prime talent on a team full of extremely talented players. He's the
world's best playmaker, perhaps the best since Michel Platini
starred for France more than a decade ago, and --- and this is
important, in Saint-Denis and his native Marseille and across the
Mediterranean in Algiers, too --- he is Algerian.
</P>
<P>
   That means plenty in what is increasingly becoming a land of
immigrants, in a country where the far right --- led by politician
Jean-Marie Le Pen --- has preached that France is for Frenchmen,
and that immigrants, such as Zidane's family, should go home.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane's mastery of this game, something he doubtless will
demonstrate in tonight's World Cup semifinal against Croatia at the
Stade de France, and the success that has followed for a French
side that features more than a half-dozen players with roots
elsewhere --- including Marcel Desailly, Lilian Thuram, Christian
Karembeu, Thierry Henry and Youri Djorkaeff --- has done more for
the cause of immigrants in France than anyone could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   A recent cartoon in Le Monde, France's most distinguished
newspaper, showed a Frenchman in a beret, a baguette under his arm,
answering a pollster. ``So, you don't really detest foreigners
then?'' the pollster asked. The Frenchman's answer: ``Not as long
as they keep scoring goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The French have had trouble scoring goals in their past two
matches, an overtime victory over Paraguay and a penalty-kick
triumph over Italy. Zidane was missing for the first, suspended for
stamping on a Saudi player during a first-round match. In the
second, he supplied his teammates with dozens of chances, all for
naught.
</P>
<P>
   He is of such importance to France's effort that winning the
World Cup is inconceivable without him. ``We all know how important
Zizou is,'' says French captain Didier Deschamps. ``Our attacking
game depends almost entirely upon him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody does not know what to do with the ball,'' adds
midfielder Emmanuel Petit, ``he gives it to Zizou, and he finds out
instantly what the best solution is.''
</P>
<P>
   That vision was borne on the streets of Marseille's La
Castellane district, a neighborhood not unlike Saint-Denis, where
he and his brother, Farid --- the sons of Algerian immigrants ---
played soccer daily on a cement square perhaps 150 yards long and
15 yards wide. ``A field to play on?'' he says. ``That was too much
to ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as it is too much for the Algerians of Saint-Denis to ask
to see the brilliant field that overlooks their homes. Tickets are
far too expensive, but Zidane offers them the opportunity to call
the stadium, the $200 million edifice to a modern France, their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three million Frenchmen unemployed,'' says an
another of Saint-Denis' Algerians. ``So why put so much money into
a stadium, which will be used only for this World Cup and then will
become our liability?''
</P>
<P>
   They'll pay for it for years --- residents claim their taxes
will rise 5 percent next year, and another 5 percent the year after
that, and so on. None of it seems worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Then they take another look at Zidane, standing tall, watching
over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This helps us to accept the cost of everything,'' says the
Algerian woman behind the counter. ``We can look out the windows
and see him. It is an enormous feeling of pride. ... He has
dignity, you know?''

RIGHTS GROUP CITES POLICE BRUTALITY IN US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Police brutality across the nation is responsible
for unjustified shootings, beatings, chokings and other forms of
physical abuse, and officers often are not held accountable for
their actions, according to a report released Tuesday by Human
Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police brutality is one of the most serious, enduring, and
divisive human rights violations in the United States,'' said the
report by the organization that monitors human rights abuses in 70
nations. ``The problem is nationwide, and its nature is
institutionalized.''
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the problem, however, is not clear because
national data on excessive force is scarce. A recent Justice
Department report shows that less than 1 percent of the 44.6
million people who had face-to-face contact with the police in 1996
were exposed to physical force ranging from being hit, held,
pushed, or choked.
</P>
<P>
   Boston bucked the findings in the report. Human Rights Watch
found fewer cases of serious police brutality in the city than in
the other 13 cities studied in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Boston fared well in a survey of police shootings in
20 cities conducted earlier this year by Newhouse News Service
showing Boston had the lowest rate of fatal shootings by police
officers _ lower than cities such as New York and Los Angeles, and
smaller cities such as Knoxville, Tenn. and Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report said the continued failure to resolve the
case of Michael A. Cox, an officer allegedly beaten by other
officers while on duty, indicates that the ``code of silence''
between police has not been broken.
</P>
<P>
   The report questioned the Boston Police Department's commitment
to dealing effectively with complaints. Citizens, they said,
faulted the department for dragging out investigations. The report
also called Boston's Community Affairs Board a ``farce,'' saying it
receives few complaints because citizens are either discouraged by
the board or unaware it exists.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Police Department did not reply Tuesday to requests
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, patterns of abusive behavior by police officers
persist because of shoddy internal investigations, failures of
leadership, and a union stranglehold on power, according to the
report, which was based on 2 1/2 years of interviews with lawyers,
police officers, experts, victim representatives, and Justice
Department officials, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said at
a news conference Tuesday that the majority of police officers do
not rely on excessive force. Those who did were protected by
secretive police investigations and by prosecutors reluctant to
press charges against officers.
</P>
<P>
   Roth accused the Justice Department of ``dropping the ball,''
pointing out that only a ``handful'' of the thousands of civil
rights complaints were prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Perez, deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights in
the Justice Department, said the department had prosecuted 289
officers for criminal violations in 159 cases since 1992. He said
the department is ``carefully studying'' the report's
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be vigilant in the prosecution and prevention of
police abuse,'' he said. ``Police work is a difficult job and most
officers are hardworking and law-abiding, but when they cross the
line, justice must be prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   City and state prosecutors did not compile statistics on the
number of officers facing criminal charges, but such cases ``appear
to be rare,'' the report said. The report received mixed reviews
from other law enforcement groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a vindication and a verification for us,'' said Ronald
Hampton, president of the National Black Police Association, which
endorsed the findings of the report. He pointed out that according
to the report minorities, particularly Latinos and African
Americans, are disproportionately brutalized by police.
</P>
<P>
   The International Association of the Chiefs of Police, on the
other hand, criticized the report for what it called its small
sampling and broad, unfair attack on the integrity of police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you say these things you have a real obligation to be
fair because they undermine public confidence,''said Bobby Moody,
the association's president.
</P>
<P>
   Police executives have made a concerted effort to address issues
of excessive force and accountability, Moody noted. Despite the
criticisms, Moody conceded that Human Rights Watch identified a
real problem. ``I want us to do more,'' he said. ``We don't do
enough in this area.''

 &HT;    22nd victim of E. coli tied to water park
 &HT;    By Diane Lore

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Fulton County, Ga. child has become the 22nd victim
of an E. coli outbreak linked to White Water park, public health
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The child, who was not identified, visited the popular
Atlanta-area water park on June 11, according to Fran Buchanan, a
Georgia Department of Human Resources spokeswoman. The child did
not require hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Of those children who were hospitalized, a 4-year-old girl is
still listed in serious condition and a 2-year-old girl is in
critical condition at Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center, said
Kim Lathbury, a hospital spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   At Egleston Children's Hospital, a 2-year-old boy continues to
be listed in good condition, according to hospital spokeswoman
Julie Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   No more tests that determine the genetic fingerprints of E. coli
O157:H7 have been completed, public health officials said. So far,
genetic tests are in on 11 cases and all are linked to White Water.

SENATE GOP CHIEF ASSAILS CLINTON ON CHINA AND TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Neb., N.J., Miss., Ark.)   (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott criticized
President Clinton on Tuesday for making ``serious mistakes'' on his
trip to China, tempering earlier praise from Republicans that
Clinton's visit was a political triumph.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Lott said on Tuesday that he had grave concerns
about Clinton's articulation of U.S. policy toward Taiwan and
introduced a bipartisan resolution to reaffirm the commitment of
Congress to a democratic Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of pressing Beijing to renounce the use of force
against Taiwan, President Clinton accepted Beijing's position on
Taiwan,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's declaration in China that the United States
would not support Taiwan's independence from the mainland was the
same as past statements by other administration officials. But it
was the first time that Clinton had described his policy.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insist that Clinton did not alter
policy one iota. Washington recognizes Beijing as the sole legal
government of China and acknowledges that Taiwan is a part of
China. At the same time Washington is committed to sell Taiwan what
is needed to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   But the slightest shift in tone or phrasing on that sensitive
foreign policy sets off seismic waves in Washington and in Asia.
``The thing that really concerned us about what the president had
to say was it seemed to open the door to something different,''
Lott told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting last week in Shanghai, Clinton appeared to grant a
concession to his Chinese hosts by making a declaration of a policy
known as the ``three no's'' _ no U.S. support for an independent
Taiwan, no recognition for a Taiwan government and no support for
Taiwan's entry into international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's stance is not new, he failed to cloak it in
the usual ambiguity that allows all sides to interpret what they
want. As a result the statement jangled nerves in Taipei and
stirred supporters of Taiwan on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to lob
accusations at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That nuance, said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., amounted to this,
``We've acknowledged the Taiwan position in the past, but we have
not embraced it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said: ``Why am I concerned with
the president's choice of words while he was in China? Because I
think it is misleading, dangerously misleading. It indicates to the
Chinese and the Taiwanese that our policy on Taiwan has changed,
when the president says it hasn't.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At least one Republican asked what all the fuss was about.
``What's really new here?'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who
supports engagement with China. ``I wonder if this isn't some way
to get a jab in at the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles of Oklahoma said the Senate
resolution would reassert what he called the old policy on Taiwan.
But when he was asked what that old policy was, Nickles said he did
not want to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic sponsor of the Taiwan resolution, Sen. Robert
Torricelli of New Jersey, said the bill aimed to clarify some of
Clinton's comments. ``He came home with real substantive
accomplishments, but we need to make clear what has changed and
what has not,'' said Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had refrained from criticizing the administration's
record on China while Clinton was there, observing an unwritten
rule that Congress shall not challenge a president's foreign policy
toward a country he is visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Republicans conceded in interviews last week that
Clinton had delivered a polished performance in his televised news
conferences in China and had struck the right tone on many
sensitive issues like human rights and religious liberties.
</P>
<P>
   But with Clinton back home and the Senate returning from a
week's recess, the gloves came off. Speaking to reporters this
morning and again Tuesday afternoon Lott said that Clinton had
failed to address adequately issues like the spread of nuclear
weapons, religious persecution and the trade imbalance between
China and the United States. Lott said Congress might have to act
to ``repair the damage that has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Senate committees will hold hearings Wednesday and
Thursday on whether sensitive U.S. missile technology was given to
Chinese rocket scientists for the launching of U.S. satellites in
China.

WILDLIFE GROUPS CRITICIZE BEAR PROTECTION MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate is trying to protect Smokey Bear and his
friends, saying they are in danger of being poached. But several
wildlife groups testified Tuesday that the bill is all smoke and no
fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Bear Protection Act would ban the import, export, sale, and
transportation of bear parts in the United States. Senator Mitch
McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and sponsor of the measure, said
the legislation would help reduce poaching for bear gall bladders
and bear feet, which are used for traditional Asian medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poaching of bears is a national problem that is destined
to become worse,'' he said Tuesday in prepared testimony for a
Senate hearing. ``Currently, there are enforcement and
jurisdictional loopholes, which exist as a result of a patchwork of
state laws, that allow this illegal poaching to flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said American bears are in danger because ``the
dramatic decline of bear populations outside the US has led
poachers to turn to American bears to fill the increasing demand.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said bear parts are ``used to treat everything from
heart disease to hangovers, and is also popular as an ingredient in
luxury shampoos and as an aphrodisiac.''
</P>
<P>
   However, most of the representatives for wildlife protection
groups who testified before the Senate Committee on Environment and
Public Works said such legislation is uneccesary, because bear
poaching is not a significant problem in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Ginette Hemley, the World Wildlife Fund's vice president for
species conservation, said illegal trade in black bear body parts
has not endangered the American bear population.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of occasional documented reports of illegal trade in
black bear body parts associated with the traditional Asian
medicine trade, state wildlife management authorities indicate
black bear populations are generally stable or increasing
throughout the country, in some cases dramatically,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Rogers, deputy director for the US Fish and Wildlife
Service, said the agency does not have evidence that bears in the
United States are threatened by the demand for bear parts.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said about 70 illegal shipments of bear parts in the past
five years have been discovered by the wildlife service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Service believes that bears in the United States have been
adequately protected to date and that this legislation addresses an
issue which has not been a major resource problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary J. Taylor, legislative director for the International
Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, said if the bill becomes
law, it would be ``an inappropriate federal intrusion into state
management authorities and prerogatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said such legislation would unnecessarily divert wildlife
enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wayne Pacelle, a senior vice president for the Humane
Society of the United States, said his group fully supports the
bill, because it ``represents a thoughtful, proactive approach to
wildlife protection that will contribute to the longterm
conservation of the world's remaining bear species. It is wrong for
this nation to allow poachers and smugglers to exploit the current
inconsistencies in state laws and profit from the sale of bear
parts.''

RUSSIANS SAY LOAN FROM IMF MAY BE LESS THAN NEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The International Monetary Fund and the Yeltsin
government are negotiating an aid package that may produce less
money than foreign investors say is needed to help ease Russia's
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have publicly stated they need $10 billion to
$15 billion in assistance from the Fund and other lenders. As
Russia's stocks, bonds and currency took a pounding on Tuesday,
some Western investment bankers say Russia may need $20 billion or
even more to rebuild investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But the IMF has privately indicated it may only be willing to
provide $5.6 billion in new loans, forcing Russia to scramble for
additional funds, Russian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The exact amount of financing from the Fund is still under
negotiation and will ultimately depend on whether the Russians take
concrete steps to cut their deficit and restructure their economy,
said Fund officials. They added, however, that after huge Asia
bailouts, IMF resources are limited.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia managed to fulfill all of the IMF's tough demands and
obtained substantial funding from commercial banks and other
institutions, it may be possible that the Kremlim could reach its
$15 billion goal, IMF officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting all of the Fund's conditions, however, will be
politically difficult.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin, for example, has urged Parliament to
adopt an ambitious ``anti-crisis'' plan to cut Russia's budget
deficit. But the IMF privately informed Russia last week that
Yeltsin's plan only goes half way toward meeting its demand that
the Russian deficit be reduced next year to 2 percent to 2.5
percent of the economy from 5.5 percent currently.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF is also insisting that Russia pass a new tax code, adopt
legislation on budget procedures, tighten bank regulation and take
bold steps to end the troublesome culture of nonpayment _ where
wages go unpaid, tax debts accumulate and companies do business in
barter.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's markets took a beating on Tuesday, as interest rates
for short-term Russian treasury bills soared to 120 percent from 90
percent on Monday, and the government acknowledged it may not be
able to find a buyer willing to pay $1.6 billion for Rosneft, the
state oil company. A rescue plan for a major Russian bank,
Tokobank, also collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to bring calm to Russia's markets, the IMF, the World
Bank and Russian officials stepped up their talks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators later said they had agreed on some of the conditions
set by the Fund. But there are still some differences over Russia's
ability to raise new revenue and impose measures to control its
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an understanding in principle on the biggest
issues,'' Anatoly Chubais, the chief Russian negotiator said on
Tuesday in an effort to reassure foreign investors. He added that
the negotiators would meet on Thursday to resolve the outstanding
issues.
</P>
<P>
   One Western official said, however, that it would difficult to
wrap up the negotiations this week, and he stressed that the
package still needed to be approved by Yeltsin and the
Communist-dominated Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and Western officials have couched the fiscal crisis as
a acid test for Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and his young team
of aides. The West has applauded Kiriyenko's free market philosophy
and his forthright manner. But now, the IMF and its allies
maintain, it is time for the new team to show that it can take
tough decisions and make them stick.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's markets have soured, however, the focus is not just
on what Moscow is prepared to do. It is also on whether the IMF is
doing enough to help end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``To avoid an even worse financial meltdown, a larger and more
imaginative program is required than the markets have heard about
so far,'' said Charles Blitzer, the director of emerging market
research at Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette, and a former World Bank
official.
</P>
<P>
   Defining how much money Russia needs is a judgment call about
the reserves of its Central Bank's reserves, Russia's mountain of
debt and the more amorphous question of how much assistance is
needed to restore confidence in Russia's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister who currently advises
the Yeltsin government, said that Russia needs $10 billion to $15
billion in assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money would be used to strengthen the Central Banks'
reserves, which are now about $15 billion. Economists say that
foreign investors hold about $20 billion in Russian treasury bills.
If they were to cash in their bills when they mature, and refuse to
accept new debt, the Central Bank's reserves would be exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some new loans could be used to restructure
Russia's short-term debt, which carries very high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, however, has maintained from the start that it is not
in the business of making new loans simply to calm investors and,
in any event, it is husbanding its dwindling resources after
fashioning a $43 billion bailout for Indonesia and an even larger
one for South Korea. It says that Russia is chiefly responsible for
solving its crisis and that in the other bailouts, additional
sources of funds, such as international banks, must also be found.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Fischer, the IMF's first deputy managing director, said
last month that a $10 billion to $15 billion contribution by the
Fund is now ``more than the IMF can give to one economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the fund stress they have not decided exactly how
much to give. They said the precise amount will depend on how much
Russia is prepared to do to put its fiscal house in order and
restructure its economy. If Russia does not undertake further
reforms before the aid is disbursed, the IMF argues, the money may
be wasted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It is Fund doctrine that the stronger the measures the country
takes the more assistance the fund can provide,'' Fischer said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Many Western investment bankers assert, however, that the fund
does not appreciate just how jittery investors are. They say that
the IMF should try to determine how much assistance is needed to
calm the markets and then provide it on the condition that Russia
agrees to a realistic program of reforms. There is no sense, they
say, in the IMF position that the more a nation does the more it
should receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that the longer the IMF waits, the more damage is
done in the process,'' said Marc Holtzman, the president of
corporate finance for ABN Amro, a leading Dutch bank. ``It is
already happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say that one approach discussed by the IMF
would provide a total of $5.6 billion in new loans.
</P>
<P>
   Half of that aid would come from expanding Russia's existing
loan, which is dubbed the Extended Fund Facility. The rest would
come from a special fund that would compensate Russia for the
effect falling oil prices have had on oil exports.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the IMF would expedite the next $670 million
payment on Russia's existing loan. That would bring the IMF's
package up to about $6.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That amount would be far less than Russia says it needs. But
Russian officials say they hope to negotiate an additional $1
billion in assistance from the World Bank. Russia also hopes to
expedite $1.5 billion in financing that the Japanese government has
agreed to provide in coordination with the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Securing all of this additional funding would not be easy, as
the World Bank has proposed its own conditions, including the
breakup of Gazprom, the huge Russian natural gas monopoly, and
other steps to restructure the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But taken together with the IMF money, these additional sources
could generate more than $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Billions in additional loans could be obtained from commercial
banks.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the two sides sought to accent the positive. But
Western officials and experts at the international financial
institutions remained worried that Yeltsin government would not be
able to follow through.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that the Parliament has already rebuffed some
important aspects of the Yeltsin's anti-crisis plan on tax policy,
including legislation on the personal income tax and other tax
changes. But Russian officials have also privately expressed
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was in the Fund's position I would give a lot to solve
the problem or I would not give anything,'' said a senior Russian
official who asked not to be identified. ``The Fund seems to feel
it has to give us something but it should not be too much. It may
lead to a negative result.''

SHOW IT OFF OR IGNORE IT: HOW THE CITY IS A HAREM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sundat, July 12.)  
 (JT)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is an urban theme and five variations. The great British
child psychoanalyst D.W. Winnicott believed that artists are driven
by the conflict between the desire to communicate and the even
stronger desire to hide. Flip this idea around, and you arrive at a
useful theory for interpreting the contemporary city: Great cities
are driven by the conflict between the desire to expose and the
even stronger desire to overlook.
</P>
<P>
   This dynamic is vividly displayed during mayoral campaigns. The
challenger's job is to expose problems the incumbent hopes voters
will ignore. Yes, street crime is down, the economy is up. But
public schools are crumbling, the homeless have reclaimed the
subways, and the city's feel-good mood seems oddly similar to
paranoid delusions of grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between exposure and overlooking is cultural as
well as political. A mayoral debate enables citizens not only to
choose between two different depictions of the city but also to
form images of their own. The debate produces raw material. The
public shapes this matter into meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Like psychiatry and the law, architecture is a way of describing
social arrangements. The Ottoman rulers had a different way of
organizing intern programs for young women. It was called the
Imperial Harem. When Monica Lewinsky first gained the public eye, I
thought it might be useful to look at the floor plans of Istanbul's
Topkapi Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The harem was sort of a dive: windowless, labyrinthine,
jerry-built. The sultan and his mother lived in the harem, too, of
course, but their quarters were splendid. For the royal wives,
concubines, eunuchs, dwarfs and other retainers, the accommodations
became increasingly dismal with the descent in social station, and
they got worse over time. As the harem's population increased,
large halls were divided into small, misshapen rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a small number of the harem women were consorts of the
sultan,'' writes Gulru Necipoglu in ``Architecture, Ceremonial, and
Power,'' an architectural history of Topkapi Palace in the 15th and
16th centuries. ``The rest were girls in their teens who were
educated full time, before being promoted to serve the sultan or
his family.''
</P>
<P>
   The word harem refers not only to concubines but also to a space
of absolute privacy. The term derives from the Arabic harim, an
inviolable area. Thus the harem was less about sexuality than about
power. Privacy was a reflection of power, and so was the ability to
share your living quarters with hundreds of people without
sacrificing privacy. Their numbers counted for nothing. This was
not a public space.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky matter may also have less to do with sexuality than
with privacy as an expression of power. The White House and the
office of the independent counsel both want to operate in secrecy.
Both sides complain about leaks while making them. Both claim
immunity from public scrutiny. And the public remains fascinated
not only by this contest of wills but by its own conflict between
the desire to expose and the desire to overlook what is going on
behind both sets of closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us would prefer not to know about private goings-on,
either at the White House or in the grand jury room. But we
understand that democracy doesn't work that way. Public officials
are subject to public scrutiny, and it cannot be left to individual
officials to draw the line between public and private realms. The
information coming out of Washington may not be pitched on
civilization's highest plane. But the conflict is generating the
raw material from which meaning can arise.
</P>
<P>
   Buildings as well as cities can be animated by the interplay
between exposure and disregarding. Two of Washington's most
important buildings in recent decades draw on that dynamic. Set
below ground level on the Mall, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is
nearly invisible from a distance. But the soft swell of earth and
the slow movement of people draws the visitor toward the footpath
and into the design: first the chevron of black granite, then the
names of the dead and the reflections of self and others hovering
ghostlike behind the names. Ultimately, one's own emotions stand
exposed: painful memories not only of the war abroad but of the
conflict the war generated at home.
</P>
<P>
   The granite facade of the United States Memorial Holocaust
Museum mimics the classical dictates of official Washington, but
with an exaggerated sense of hollowness and vacancy. Thus the
facade becomes a symbol of the deception and concealment of the
totalitarian state. Inside, the barbarism and madness of Nazi
Germany are exposed almost beyond the viewer's tolerance, not only
by the exhibits but also by the harshness and distortions of the
building itself. At the roofline, a series of brick forms
resembling watchtowers recalls the state's surveillance of those
deprived of all right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   By using different kinds of dynamic interplay between
transparency, opacity and reflection, some of New York's greatest
modern buildings also draw on the friction between exposure and
tuning out: the CBS Building, the Ford Foundation, the Seagram
Building, the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Chase Bank on
Fifth Avenue at 43d Street. And recently, Raimund Abraham's design
for the Austrian Cultural Institute demonstrates that this theme
has not been artistically exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, a suburban mentality has gripped the
city's designers. In her classic study, ``The Moral Order of a
Suburb,'' the sociologist M.P. Baumgartner suggests that suburbs
are driven by the desire to ignore conflict. In affluent suburban
communities, she writes, people regard conflict as a ``social
contaminant,'' something to be prevented if at all possible and
ended quickly once begun. ``Should interpersonal conflicts have
positive functions or be in any sense a desirable property of
social life, these suburbanites are unaware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar outlook has taken hold in places like Battery Park
City. Modeled after New York's residential architecture of the
1920s, the buildings disregard the extent to which the city has
changed since then. Instead of allowing architecture to respond
imaginatively to the changing city, these buildings stick glumly to
the lowest common denominator of taste.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Giuliani's plan for an emergency management bunker
sounds suspiciously like a harem: an inviolable area of privacy
that symbolizes the Mayor's view of his power. And this bomb-proof
seraglio is philosophically of a piece with Giuliani's so-called
civility campaign. Civility is fine, but stifling criticism is not,
nor is trying to evade public scrutiny as by, for instance, burying
plans for the harem in the city budget.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, the civility campaign is anti-urban as well as
undemocratic. Most politicians recognize that in the
post-industrial age, culture is not just an ornament of the city
but a cornerstone of its future. Without culture there is no city,
and without conflict there is no culture. The only good thing about
the civility campaign is the rudeness with which it has been waged
(mayor to Grammies: Get Lost!). Museums, theaters and concert halls
are all magnificent public attractions, but conflict remains the
most important cultural product a great city puts out.

   STARI TNG, Yugoslavia _ The metal cage tumbled to the guts of
the Stari Tng mine, with its glittering veins of lead, zinc,
cadmium, gold and silver, its stagnant pools of water and muck, its
steamy blasts, its miles of dank, gloomy tunnels and its vast
stretches of Stygian darkness.
</P>
<P>
   As the iron box rattled and squealed on the ear-popping journey,
dropping at 18 feet a second, it left behind the potent symbols of
nationalism and ethnic identity scattered in disarray on the ground
above. Instead, in the shrill cacophony, it exposed the real worth
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The medieval Serbian monasteries and churches, crumbling mosques
with silver domes and spindly minarets and a dark stone tower
brooding over the Field of Blackbirds, where the Turks wiped out
Serbian nobles 600 years ago and began 500 years of Ottoman rule,
seemed to evaporate in the thin air.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting between the rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
with their intoxicating visions of an independent state, and the
50,000 Serbian soldiers and special policemen, who rule the
province of Kosovo like a plantation, touched no one here. Neither
did the rattle of gunfire, the thud of mortars, the anguish of
refugees and bodies of the recently killed.
</P>
<P>
   Half a mile underground, hissing rubber air hoses were looped
along tunnel walls and small lights hooked on the hard hats of
miners bobbed in the inky universe. Worm-like diesel loaders roared
through the corridors, laden with sparkling ore, and huge drills
snarled and spat at the rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is over 30 percent lead and zinc in the ore,'' said
Novak Bjelic, the mine's beefy director. ``The war in Kosovo is
about the mines, nothing else. This is Serbia's Kuwait _ the heart
of Kosovo. We export to France, Switzerland, Greece, Sweden, the
Czech Republic, Russia and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We export to a firm in New York, but I would prefer not to
name it. And in addition to all this Kosovo has 17 billion tons of
coal reserves. Naturally, the Albanians want all this for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling state-owned Trepca mining complex, the most
valuable piece of real estate in the Balkans, is worth at least $5
billion and has made millions of dollars for Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, according to his critics. Serbia and its junior
partner, Montenegro, are what remains of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1989, Milosevic revoked the autonomous status given to
the ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the 2 million
people in Kosovo, and he has refused to return any kind of
self-governance. He is trying to crush a mounting armed resistance
to his rule, and it appears that the mines, at least for a while,
will earn him even more money.
</P>
<P>
   The Stari Tng mine, with its warehouses, is ringed with smelting
plants, 17 metal treatment sites, freight yards, railroad lines, a
power plant and the country's largest battery plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last three years we have mined 2,538,124 tons of lead
and zinc crude ore,'' said Bjelic, 58, ``and produced 286,502 tons
of concentrated lead and zinc and 139,789 tons of pure lead, zinc,
cadmium, silver and gold.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Nazis seized this corner of the Balkans in 1941, they
handed over the hovels in Pristina, the provincial capital, to the
Italian fascists. But they kept the British-built Trepca mines for
the Reich, shipping out wagonloads of minerals for weapons and
producing the batteries that powered the U-boats. Submarine
batteries, along with ammunition, are still produced in the Trepca
mines. The mining history reaches back to the Romans, who hacked
out silver from the quarries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, as Yugoslavia began to disintegrate, the fiercest
resistance to Milosevic's vision of a Serb-dominated Yugoslavia
roared out of the shafts of the four Trepca mines.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by the growth of the Serbian nationalist movement led by
Milosevic, the ethnic Albanian miners, who made up 75 percent of
the 23,000 employees, shut down the mines and organized a
30-mile-long protest march to Pristina. They carried photos of the
late communist leader, Josip Broz Tito, and Yugoslav flags adorned
with the communist red star. The fealty shown to the old Yugoslavia
appears naive and quaint given the armed rebellion under way in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed in Yugoslavia,'' said Burhan Kavaja, the former
director of the Stari Tng mine, who was dismissed and imprisoned
after the first strike. ``We wanted to belong. You would never see
an Albanian carry the state flag today. This conflict will only end
now with our independence. Until then the Serbs will loot the
mineral wealth of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic promised the strikers that he would respect the
province's autonomy and remove nationalist Serbs from positions of
power. The miners returned to the shafts.
</P>
<P>
   A year later the miners, realizing that they had been betrayed,
began a series of hunger strikes and occupied the mines. The mine
protests led to general strikes throughout Kosovo, making Trepca
the nerve center of the resistance movement.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian special policemen eventually seized the mine, carrying
weakened miners out on stretchers. When the province's autonomy was
revoked, a state of emergency was declared. The ethnic Albanian
miners were replaced with Poles, Czechs and _ later _ Muslim
prisoners of war captured by the Serbs in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   These days, no more than 15 percent of the current 15,000 mine
workers are of Albanian origin, the government says, and most
ethnic Albanians insist that the figures vastly overestimate their
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Branimir Dimitrijevic, one of the mine's managers, waded through
a corridor filled with water, slime and mud that reached up and
wrapped itself around his black rubber boots. A huge Swedish
iron-cutting machine, one of four in the mine, whirled and belched
like some deep-sea monster. Spotlights mounted on its cab lit up a
vein of ore, and as the minerals oxidized, creating a suffocating
heat, the miners were left gulping for air.
</P>
<P>
   The workers, bare-chested and blackened with grime in the vast
sweat house, stood aside when a trolley loaded with chunks of rock
rumbled down a tunnel on the iron tracks.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, Dimitrijevic received the disturbing news that a
factory two miles away, where clothing for the miners is produced,
had been seized by the rebels. Armed separatist guerrillas now
guard the gates, and Serbs avoid the dirt road to the factory. No
one has yet tried to take it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never give up Trepca!'' he shouted over the drilling.
``Serbs will fight to defend the mine. It is ours. We know how to
make war if this is what the Albanians want.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come to take my brother, then I will take three
Albanians to my private prison until he is released. This is the
only way to fight. This is the only language the Albanians
understand.''

A BURST OF ROCK, BRIGHT AS THE RISING SUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 12)  
 (JT)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ It is a decrepit and smoky basement club, but the place
is jammed with girls screaming for the Outsiders, a band led by a
charismatic long-haired guitarist who shakes his mane as he puts
one foot on a stage monitor and lets rip a thunderous solo that
shakes the room. Terri MacMillan, a music manager, watches with a
banana grin, convinced that she has found a future superstar. She
can picture him headlining arenas to mobs of guys playing air
guitar and teen-aged girls screaming his name. She is literally
jumping up and down in rapture. Only we are not in New York,
Seattle or Omaha. We are in Tokyo. And Ms. MacMillan is the only
other American in the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that this is happening,'' she says excitedly,
``but the problem is convincing everybody else. It's just like
Britain all over again, only everyone is afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. MacMillan is referring to the explosion of Japanese pop and
rock music. For the past two decades, Japan has been home to the
world's second largest music industry behind America's, but only
recently, in the face of economic crisis and sweeping social
change, has it reached the diversity and originality necessary to
find an audience in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to break Japanese bands overseas for 10
years _ 10 long years,'' says Tom Toeda, Ms. MacMillan's partner in
a music management company here, Chibiya. ``Now, finally, we feel
we're in the right time and at the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan today is in some ways like England circa 1960, when
Americans thought of British music as just a substandard imitation
of American pop. But then came the Beatles, proving that the
British weren't just copying American rock and rhythm-and-blues but
coming up with their own interpretations, starting a British
invasion that has continued, ebbing and surging, to this day. The
situation is similar in Japan: pieces of American, British and even
French, German and Swedish popular music are being fused into
something Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``With cars and stereos, those things are invented somewhere
else,'' Toeda says. ``Then they come to Japan; we redo it our own
way and make it a little better and then put it out. So maybe
that's what's happening in the music scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Western music audience is too fragmented for another
pop juggernaut on the order of the Beatles to emerge, in nearly
each splinter of rock and pop there are Japanese bands good enough
to rank among the upper echelons. Ms. MacMillan and Toeda, who have
already taken two Japanese bands, Pizzicato Five and Buffalo
Daughter, from obscurity to college-rock favorites in America,
believe that all it would take is for Japan to export a handful of
slightly more successful bands to bring the country closer to
ranking alongside America and England as a pop and rock capital _
especially in this time of creative stagnation in popular music in
America and increasing openness to Asian pop culture. Their
business plan is to find unknown bands in Japan and make them stars
in America before anybody has heard of them at home and then bring
them back to Japan as conquering heroes. This scenario may be
possible within 5 to 10 years. But is the American pop public
ready?
</P>
<P>
   Many American music executives are doubtful. ``It will never
happen,'' barks one label president, speaking on the condition of
anonymity. ``They look different than we do. They speak different
than we do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, have no doubt. Besides Ms. McMillan, there are
people like Steve Pross, the obsessive, excitable 42-year-old head
of Emperor Norton Records, an independent label based in Los
Angeles that is owned by Peter Getty, the grandson of J. Paul
Getty. Three days after the Outsiders show, Pross is at a much
larger club in Tokyo, proudly watching the newest addition to his
label's roster, the Zoobombs, thrash on stage before a sold-out
house. A great garage, punk and blues-rock band, the Zoobombs play
funky grooves that explode into guitar-bashing choruses made up of
single catch phrases. As the singer and guitarist Don Matsuo _
equal parts Elvis Presley, James Brown and Beck _ spits out lines
like ``You need to get mo' funky,'' some 1,000 fans pogo up and
down in response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the next Beck or the next Paul McCartney is going to
come from Japan,'' Pross says as he observes the scene from the
club balcony. ``And I want to be the one to find him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pross is in Tokyo preparing to release three albums by Japanese
bands _ the Zoobombs, Takako Minekawa and Fantastic Plastic Machine
_ in America as well as to find more Japanese bands to license. For
Pross, one of the few American music executives actively looking
for Japanese bands, running around to record stores and labels in
Tokyo feels like striking oil. And he is rushing to stake a claim
on as much as he can before the big corporations move in.
</P>
<P>
   ``After talking to you,'' he tells the head of one Japanese
record label during a meeting, ``I think my record company is going
to do better licensing Japanese bands and selling them in America
than licensing American bands and selling them to Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does Japanese pop music sound like?
</P>
<P>
   Going to Japan to write about its music scene is not like going
to France to write about the electronic music boom there or to
China to write about its rebel rockers, because there isn't a scene
in Japan; there are hundreds of scenes. For those who like the
testosterone-happy American rock bands Rage Against the Machine,
311 and Everclear, there are the Japanese counterparts Mad Capsule
Markets, Backdrop Bomb and Thee Michelle Gun Elephant. If your
tastes run to Alanis Morissette, Tori Amos and Tracy Chapman, there
are Cocco, Bonnie Pink and Ua. And most of them aren't mere
knockoffs. Singing in Japanese, English and ``Japlish,'' these acts
have come up with a fusion of their own, albeit one influenced by
American and European bands. What's surprising is that it's not
excellence in recent American music that has inspired this
flowering of Japanese bands; rather, many Japanese musicians say
it's the staleness of new imported rock that has given them
confidence in their own music. In fact, Western music has slipped
from a majority market share in Japan to less than 25 percent as
Japanese bands have matured.
</P>
<P>
   There are three types of Japanese musicians attracting small
audiences in America. One is made up of obscure, uncompromising
Japanese avant-garde bands _ psychedelic rockers like Ghost,
improvisational guitarists like Keiji Haino and noise bands like
Merzbow _ who have been heroes in the American underground for
years. The second consists of bands that fit into niche genres _
punk, ska and especially electronic dance music, which doesn't
depend on lyrics and language _ in which fans feel part of an
international community of music-makers. Some of the top acts in
these genres, like the punk band Hi-Standard and the techno
musician Ken Ishii, already have American record deals and have
sold tens of thousands of albums overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The third type of Japanese band emerging in America is the most
interesting because it doesn't fit into an existing style. These
bands are evidence of an emerging Japanese sound and esthetic. Like
reggae in Jamaica _ an attempt to replicate American
rhythm-and-blues that turned into its own genre when the musicians
got the beat wrong _ the Japanese sound has roots in a failed
imitation. Sometimes referred to as Shibuya kei, after Tokyo's busy
youth shopping district and home to foreign record chains, the
Japanese style is a pop tsunami swamping everything in its path and
washing it ashore in a jumble. Think of the music as an aural
equivalent of Japanese commercial slogans like ``Calcium loading.
Get! In! Hold!'' (for the drink Kirin Cadi). Its cultural
appropriations bend logic, break rules and inadvertently come up
with new and likable turns of phrase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the artists themselves will admit that so much of the
style is built on a misinterpretation of American culture,'' says
Bryan Burton-Lewis, who plays the music as a host on the Osaka
radio station FM802 and the cable channel Space Shower TV and who
also helps write lyrics for Yoshinori Sunahara, Kahimi Karie,
Chara, Bridge and Cornelius. ``They'll build an entire world around
a few albums, TV programs and movies _ and then they finally get to
America and England and find out that it's completely different
than they imagined. But in the end they've created something
original, a world of their own, which therefore they like better.''

</P>
<P>
   In a youth culture in which keeping up with trends insures
popularity, coolness is a function of obsession, a trait that has
helped make Japanese record stores the most extensive and
impressive in the world. Some of the best Japanese bands making
inroads in America _ acts like Pizzicato Five and Cornelius on
Matador Records in New York, Buffalo Daughter on the Beastie Boys'
label, Grand Royal, and Fantastic Plastic Machine on Emperor Norton
_ are indefatigable record shoppers who mix and match every genre
that interests them in their music.
</P>
<P>
   They worship at the altar of classic pop groups like the Beach
Boys, soft-pop acts like Burt Bacharach, film composers like Ennio
Morricone, rappers like Public Enemy, psychedelic rockers like Pink
Floyd and French singers like Serge Gainsbourg. ( Gainsbourg's use
of American pop-culture phrases in his songs could be seen as
evidence of a very Japanese esthetic, as could the quotation-filled
music of Beck and the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.)
</P>
<P>
   I always thought I was just making Western music,'' says
Cornelius. ``But now that people all over the world are listening
to it and I'm able to get their reactions, they're telling me that
they see my music as Japanese sounding. The way the information is
overloaded _ even the copycat imagery _ people say is very Tokyo,
very Japan. When I was told that, I realized that was true.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to the current flowering of Japanese pop and
rock than simply the sound of one collector collecting. Shingo
Sugiyama, an independent producer who is working with a musician
whom Ms. McMillan wants to take to America _ a young, raw singer
named Kayoko _ believes that Japan may be on the verge of a period
analogous to the late `60s in America, when a young generation
began to question the wisdom of its elders. As Japan is learning
the economic lesson that the summit is the point closest to the
precipice, a drop-out culture of people who don't want to join
companies after graduation is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids making music now were born in Japan's richest
time,'' Sugiyama says. ``They were spoiled. If they wanted a guitar
or a sampler, their parents would buy them one. But as they began
to reach the age when it was time for them to enter the workforce,
the bubble burst, and they began to feel helpless. The companies
their parents worked so hard for were dropping; they started asking
questions like: `What are we working for? Where are we heading?'''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the music will begin to matter in America depends on a
number of variables. In the music's favor is the fact that over the
last few years American culture has slowly begun opening up to
Asian culture. There's the popularity of Hong Kong film stars like
Jackie Chan, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat; Hollywood
Asian-derived blockbusters like ``Mulan'' and ``Godzilla'';
Japanese video games like Parappa the Rapper and Street Fighter and
Japanese animation. One American record executive, Karyn Rachtman
at Interscope, says she has an 8-year-old son who reads only
Japanese comic books and whose ambition is to make a movie in
Japanese when he grows up.
</P>
<P>
   Since American popular music was introduced to Japan after World
War II, pop has occasionally leaked out of Japan and into the
Western consciousness. There were, for example, ``Sukiyaki'' (the
first and only Japanese song to hit No. 1 in America) in the `60s;
the pioneering electronic music group Yellow Magic Orchestra; the
novelty duo Pink Lady in the `70s, and the heavy-metal group
Loudness in the `80s. But these success stories were aberrations.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest hurdle that Japanese music has to overcome
is one of credibility. Since the 1970s, the music that has
dominated the Japanese charts has been made by cheesy,
over-produced musicians more talented at personal grooming than
singing. These manufactured acts _ pin-ups like B'z, Glay, Speed,
Smap and, the most fun of the lot, the classic-rock quoting duo
Puffy _ are known as idols. Though the public taste for idols is
beginning to wane in Japan, as the music industry is struggling
with flat sales and losing touch with its audience, the Japanese
bands that have put the most effort into making it in America have
been the idols. And yet despite the tons of money that have been
poured into marketing campaigns for stars like Seiko Matsuda and
Toshi Kubota on Columbia Records, they have failed miserably in
America, doing more to tarnish the reputation of Japanese music
than to help it. As a result, many record labels in Japan are
cynical about breaking acts in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no good for business when a band goes to America, because
when they come back their Japanese audience is gone,'' says Osamu
Sato, chairman of BMG Records Japan. ``So it's nice to have a
dream, but a dream and business are not always the same.''
</P>
<P>
   What befuddles Japanese record executives the most is that
despite their efforts to market popular Japanese artists in
America, the Japanese bands that end up building a fan base there
are obscure ones like the cutesy female rock trio Shonen Knife.
``We all want to know why bands like B'z and Glay don't do good
internationally, but bands like Pizzicato Five and Cornelius do,''
says Tomonori Satoh, the head of artists and repertory at Nippon
Columbia's Triad label.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Cahoon, the head of Tower Records Asia, believes that he
has the answer. ``Foreigners like Japanese bands that smell
Japanese,'' he says. ``The reason Toshi Kubota is not interesting
to most people in America is because they can see a guy doing
covers of black music at a corner bar. Kubota does a good imitation
of soul music, but it's still an imitation. But if you see Shonen
Knife, they sing about Japanese things like crowded trains,
obsessively buying Louis Vuitton luggage and eating ice cream after
a bath. Ryuichi Sakamoto and Kitaro use distinctively Japanese
melodies. The many Japanese noise bands reflect the intense lives
and pent-up anger of Japanese culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Virgin Records in America is gearing up for a campaign
for an English-language record by the Japanese pop band Dreams Come
True, most labels are beginning to catch on. Sony recently hired a
representative from Japan, Archie Meguro, to figure out how best to
bring Japanese bands into the American market. His plan, he says,
is to work with small underground acts _ like Ken Ishii, the
hip-hop musician DJ Honda, the trip-hop artist DJ Krush and a
Japanese equivalent of the Chemical Brothers called the Boom Boom
Satellites. What is interesting about DJ Krush and DJ Honda as well
as other dance-oriented Japanese acts like Natural Calamity and
Silent Poets is that they sidestep language differences by working
with American and European singers and rappers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one day the sound of Japanese vocalists singing in
English and mispronouncing their r's will begin to sound as cool in
America as a British accent, and Japanese-language songs will seem
as romantic and beguiling as a French chanson. For this dream to
come true, however, it is not Japanese music that will have to
change. It is American myopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In England and Japan, people have been listening to American
music since the `60s,'' says Daisuke Kawasaki, who runs an
indie-rock magazine, Beikoku-Ongaku, and record label. ``But in
America they're just starting to catch up to all the Japanese and
European music we've been listening to. So maybe it is the American
mind that is different now.''

WINDOWS ON THE CANALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 12.)  
(JT) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ In many cities the hotels with the best
locations and views command the highest prices. But in Amsterdam a
web of canals threads through the central city, insuring that even
those without deluxe accommodation budgets can ensconce themselves
in rooms with glorious waterfront views.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter, who works in Amsterdam, has become an expert on
hotels and restaurants that tourists often overlook. For my visit
in March, she suggested the Ambassade, a hotel created out of 10
adjacent houses four and five stories high along the posh
Herengracht (one of the city's central canals) that the two owners
began converting in 1953. A 10-minute walk from the heart of
downtown Amsterdam, the small, intimate and elegant Ambassade is
not precisely a business hotel: There are no answering machines or
faxes in each room, although voice mail has since been introduced.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want a slightly larger hotel but like the notion
of living in the period houses the Dutch favor, there is the
Pulitzer, also close to the heart of the city, but with 224 rooms
and a more institutional feel.
</P>
<P>
   Many Dutch, particularly those who live in cities, speak
excellent English and are generally friendly. The staff at the
Ambassade, for example, is efficient at taking messages and making
restaurant reservations as well as finding museum and train
schedules, so a business traveler seeking a bit of atmosphere need
not feel out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   The Ambassade's rooms are $174 a night and suites are $228, with
tax (at 1.86 guilders to $1). My spacious room had a double bed
with large, soft pillows and a thick yellow bedspread-comforter,
which came in handy. The two reading chairs _ reproduction Louis
XVI _ were covered in yellow and pink striped silk that went nicely
with a small Louis XVI style writing desk and side tables.
</P>
<P>
   The spacious bathroom contained fluffy white terry robes, an
ample pile of towels and a hair dryer. And the bath was deep and
long enough to sink into after a full day of strolling.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast, which is included in the room price, can be ordered
through room service, which my daughter and I did the previous
evening. It arrived punctually, and we discovered that the Dutch
version of a bare-bones Continental breakfast is far more ample
than the French edition of rolls and coffee. Our breakfast included
boiled eggs, orange juice and three different breads.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch, avid chocoholics, like chocolate sprinkles or a thick
chocolate pudding-like spread atop their bread and butter. There
were small packets of the spread, as well as pate, peanut butter,
jams and honey.
</P>
<P>
   Room service is undoubtedly a luxury; still, breakfast in the
Ambassade's dining room, with its gleaming laquered white walls, is
itself a treat. The glass panes of the two-story windows are
meticulously polished, and the white and blue tablecloths are just
as painstakingly ironed. For more than the standard breakfast, the
buffet offered a selection of cereals and yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   There is no bar as such, but one can order drinks in the large
sitting room, which has a dramatic view of the canals and is
furnished with some stunning antiques, including a signed 1700s
Dutch grandfather clock.
</P>
<P>
   My outdated guidebook said that the Rijksmuseum was closed on
Monday, but the hotel staff knew that major museums are now open
seven days. They also quickly got the train schedule for the Hague
when I made a pilgrimage to the Mauritshuis, one of the country's
greatest small museums.
</P>
<P>
   Umbrellas are a necessity in the Netherlands, where it rains
often. A large collection sits in the lobby, and guests can use
them for the day, a gesture for which I was particularly grateful
on a morning where I awoke to a rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because it does rain so much the Dutch are avid readers.
There are often lines at the checkout counters in bookstores, and
the hotel, small as it is, stocked the International Herald
Tribune, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Time and Newsweek in
the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Though the hotel now has just 52 rooms, the owners are
remodeling the 10th house, which faces the Singel canal, and will
have six more rooms and a second elevator by the end of 1999. About
two thirds of the rooms face directly onto the canal, so be sure to
ask and reserve well ahead. Even in rainy March, the hotel was
heavily booked.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year the Ambassade opened a flotation-tank and
massage center down the street. But hotel guests have no priority
over the general public, so floats ($27 for 45 minutes) and
massages ($32 for 45 minutes) are often booked in advance; reserve
on arrival or earlier.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It is no cause for an orange Tower, riotous
swarming of the Drag, parades or gaudy trophies.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're a proud University of Texas alum who needs
something in the athletic program to be proud about, there's this
recent development:

   In 1997-98, the Longhorns won six national titles, including a
sweep of the three big men's sports _ football, basketball and
baseball.

 AMSTERDAM: or earlier.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In contrast to the tranquil, cozy Ambassade, the Hotel Pulitzer
Hotel, now an ITT Sheraton, bustles with three restaurants, an art
gallery and a new business center with rentals of personal
computers, faxes, laser printers and mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Ambassade it is made up of a series of internally
joined landmark homes that border two canals, in this case the
Prinsengracht and Keizersgracht.
</P>
<P>
   Many of its 224 rooms in the 24 adjacent buidings offer water
views as extraordinary as those at the Ambassade and the staff at
the Pulitzer, though more harried, attempts to be accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   Here the similarities end, however. The Pulitzer is larger and
more impersonal and more oriented to the business traveler. Because
the hotel owns houses on two canals and has interconnected them,
the lobby essentially runs from the entrance on the Prinsengracht
through to the main restaurants, which are on the Keizersgracht.
The lobby now includes a lounge that serves coffee and snacks
beginning at 8 a.m., a nice touch because many flights from the
United States arrive early in the morning before rooms are ready.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those rooms are decorated similarly, in the pink-beige
that seems to be generic in many American hotels. My comfortably
large room had the requisite pale beige rugs, wicker furniture with
pink upholstery and a wicker table and desk. The bedspreads,
predictably, were also pinkish. The bath was modern and clean, and
comfortably large. But ordinary decor could not undermine the
stunning views across the Prinsengracht from my fifth-floor room.
</P>
<P>
   Those views are particularly magical at night. Not only are the
most popular bridges illuminated with tiny lights around their
arches, but in the center of Amsterdam, many buildings are
illuminated, too. And the doors and windows are impeccably painted
to a shining gloss as if responding to some official mandate to
keep up appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch often leave their curtains open, perhaps a remnant of
the Calvinist belief that draped windows might hide sins. Often,
while walking, one can peek in on families at home. And from both
my hotel rooms I could get glimpses into dining rooms and bedrooms
missed at the street level.
</P>
<P>
   Although my room at the Pulitzer overlooked the water, the young
woman who gave me a tour of other rooms explained that some rooms
are on the interior garden, which is indeed lovely and boasts some
sculptures, and some are on an internal courtyard. The rooms on the
canal and the garden cost $304 to $339 a night, and 80 of the
Pulitzer's rooms have been redecorated either in a scheme of green
and red, or blue and gold. All have data-port phones and a handful
offer faxes, copiers and larger desks. The rooms on the courtyard
are $263 to $309. In booking ahead, it might be wise to pin down
what view you would like and ask for a written confirmation. The
hotel does not have an exercise room, although most tourists walk
so much in Amsterdam, they might well be too tired to face a gym.
</P>
<P>
   I was not told, nor was my travel agent, that the hotel was
undergoing expansion, and though the noise was not bothersome, much
of the lobby was not really usable.
</P>
<P>
   The renovations (now complete) did not excuse the lack of diet
cola and a bottle opener in the otherwise well-stocked mini-bar,
but it may have triggered a cable problem that shut down all the TV
sets in the hotel for several hours after I arrived.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pulitzer, breakfast was not included in the room price.
The informal dining area is a wicker wonderland that could be in
any United States city, but the view gives away the location: It
overlooks a canal and a slew of shops including a flower stall
where, even in the pouring rain, plants were everywhere. The $17.75
breakfast included a buffet table with dry cereals and hot plates
with scrambled eggs, sausages and bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the remodeling, the more modest dining room was
closed for dinner, though a casual bar was open. Given the weather,
three of us decided to eat at de Goudsbloem, the hotel's fancier
restaurant. It was costly though intriguing because the menu,
according to my Dutch guest, was inordinately ambitious. Although
it changes regularly, the lineup that night was typical. Among the
appetizers: salad of baked breast of pigeon with horse mushrooms
and a beet-root vinaigrette ($14.25) and a salad of candied veal
cheeks with kumquats and caraway vinaigrette ($9.25). Main courses
included a choice of filet of suckling pig covered with a crust of
garlic and tarragon juice ($21.25) or a tart of guinea fowl in a
crust with a sauce of onions ($21.25). The green dining room was
quiet and a bit formal, with classical columns separating one part
of the dining room from the other, and tables comfortably far
apart. Service was friendly and the food adequate. The bill for
three, with tip, was $135.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed good value in contrast to the coffee I ordered the
morning I left, for which I was charged $1.75. The good news: It
was delivered to my room at 6 a.m. on the dot as requested, and a
friendly doorman with the necessary large umbrella showed me to my
waiting cab.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Ambassade, 341 Herengracht, 1016 az Amsterdam, telephone
(31-20) 626-2333, fax (31-20) 624-5321. The 52 rooms range from
$174 for a standard double to $228 for a suite (at 1.86 guilders to
$1). Rates include breakfast, service and tax. Rooms are decorated
individually and each has the personal feel of a chic apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Pulitzer, 315-331 Prinsengracht, 1016 gz Amsterdam,
(31-20) 523-5235, fax (31-20) 627-6753. It has 224 rooms; those on
either the canals or the garden are $304 to $349 a day, on the
courtyard $263 to $309. Breakfast and taxes are extra. Some higher
priced rooms have computers and faxes. The staff suggests calling
Sheraton reservations, (800) 325-3535, for possible discounts.

   With both hotels, a written confirmation is recommended.

MARYLAND INVESTIGATES TRIPP'S TAPING OF LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Linda Tripp returned to the federal grand jury
investigating the Lewinsky matter, Maryland officials said Tuesday
that they had begun a separate criminal inquiry into whether Mrs.
Tripp violated a state law that makes it a crime for one person to
record a telephone conversation without the consent of the other.
</P>
<P>
   A Maryland prosecutor has convened a grand jury to begin
investigating whether Mrs. Tripp should be prosecuted for taping
about 20 hours of telephone conversations she had with Monica
Lewinsky, a fellow Pentagon worker, beginning last year. The tapes
formed the basis for the Lewinsky inquiry that began nearly six
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But any prosecution against Mrs. Tripp could be problematic
because she has received two grants of immunity, one from the
Whitewater independent counsel's office and the other from a
federal judge in a sealed order, lawyers and other people involved
in the Lewinsky matter said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They said those grants of immunity sharply limited the ability
of any prosecutor to use either the tapes or testimony by Mrs.
Tripp to build a criminal case against her for unlawful telephone
taping.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about her possible liability under Maryland law, Mrs.
Tripp decided to become a cooperating witness last January only
after receiving the grants of immunity, lawyers involved in the
case said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked for immunity and she got it,'' said James Moody, her
lawyer at the time. ``I knew it was routine for whistle-blowers to
be in fear of retaliation and so I made the request for the
immunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge's order relies on a federal law that says no testimony
or evidence directly or indirectly received from a witness ``may be
used against the witness in any criminal case, except a prosecution
for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise failing to
comply with the order.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the Maryland prosecutor, Stephen
Montanarelli, knew the extent of the immunity that has been
conferred on Mrs. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp has become a central witness in the investigation by
the independent counsel into whether anyone committed perjury or
obstruction in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against
President Clinton. Mrs. Tripp has told investigators in the
independent counsel's office that Ms. Lewinsky encouraged her to
lie in the lawsuit about Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with the
president.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As Mrs. Tripp completed her third day of testimony before the
grand jury here, her lawyer Anthony Zaccagnini appeared on the
courthouse steps Tuesday to read a statement she had issued about
the Maryland grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe today's announcement is the latest in a series of
attempts to intimidate me,'' the statement said. ``This is
evidenced by the fact that this occurs at the very moment I am
testifying before the federal grand jury. I am not intimidated in
any way. I will continue to testify truthfully and completely and I
urge everyone involved to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaccagnini met Tuesday with officials in the independent
counsel's office to discuss the Maryland inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, who is in Southern California, suggested through
her spokeswoman that she was pleased by the decision of the
Maryland prosecutor to open the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every American has the right to and the expectation of privacy
in their private conversations,'' said the spokeswoman, Judy Smith.
``The decision of the state attorney to empanel a grand jury to
investigate Linda Tripp and perhaps others concerning the recording
of private conversations will help establish that our cherished
right of privacy cannot be trampled on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Mrs. Tripp said they expect her to return to the
grand jury Thursday. &QL;

FURIOUS FABRICATORS OF A FAUST FOR THE DIGITAL ERA  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain _ La Fura Dels Baus is as unusual a name in
Catalan as it is in English: the Ferret from the Baus. But there
was method to the fantasy of the five young street performers who
chose the name of their new experimental theater company in
Barcelona in 1979. The ferret, which can be trained but not tamed,
appealed to their anarchic instincts, while the Baus is the name of
a dark ravine near their hometown of Moya, 30 miles north of
Barcelona, where the five would hang out before they moved here in
their late teens. So it sort of made sense.
</P>
<P>
   The group has offered other, perhaps fanciful, translations in
the past. But by now the name has long outgrown deconstruction.
Today, at least to its legion of fans across Western Europe, La
Fura dels Baus is synonymous with an unorthodox, multidisciplinary
form of theater that uses loud music, violent movement, bizarre
machinery and almost no words to create a near-apocalyptic
atmosphere. It likes to perform before a standing audience in
nontheatrical spaces like plazas and warehouses, frequently taking
the action into the crowd. It has even spawned a Spanish adjective,
furero, to describe its special lenguaje furero, its Furan
language.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed appropriate, then, that Carlos Padrissa, one of La
Fura's founders, felt a need to explain, even justify, the break
with tradition represented by its latest work, ``F(AT)ust, Version
3.0,'' which will be performed July 22 through 26 at the New York
State Theater as part of this year's Lincoln Center Festival. The
company has not surrendered to convention. Yet, for the first time,
it is presenting a theatrical work before a seated audience using a
written text, in this case inspired by no less than Goethe. Over
the past two months, the play has been performed here, mainly in
Catalan, at the National Theater of Catalonia. In New York, the
show, which lasts 99 minutes without a break, will be in Spanish
with English supertitles.
</P>
<P>
   So could it be that success is corrupting the enfants terribles
of La Fura into respectability? Or is the lenguaje furero now so
persuasive that it is penetrating mainstream theater? The way that
``F(AT)ust, Version 3.0'' came about suggests the latter. In 1996,
the Granada International Dance and Music Festival invited Padrissa
and another company member, Alex Olle, to try their hand at musical
theater. Their production of Manuel de Falla's ``Atlantida'' was
seen by Gerard Mortier, the director of the Salzburg Festival, who
promptly invited them to direct ``The Damnation of Faust'' by
Berlioz in Salzburg in 1999. It was as a result of this commission
that they turned their attention to the legend of Faust, and
``F(AT)ust, Version 3.0'' came about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had read Goethe's `Faust' as a kid, but only Part I,''
recalled Padrissa, a wiry, balding man of 39. ``We began to read it
again and saw it would work for our language because Goethe was the
first to break with a linear sense of time. If the character of
Faust was eternally unhappy, he would be still unhappier at the end
of the millennium. So we decided to do a theater version of
`Faust,' but using our own methods. We remain loyal to the spirit
of the work, but the form is new.''
</P>
<P>
   Having seen ``F(AT)ust, Version 3.0'' here last month, Mortier
has now asked La Fura to take it to Salzburg along with ``The
Damnation of Faust'' next summer. How German and Austrian audiences
respond to this information-age reworking of Goethe's masterpiece,
in which the work's very name plays upon the language of software,
may be one of the more interesting footnotes of the 1999 festival.
``Our Faust is not a post-Renaissance elitist,'' Padrissa
explained. ``Today, with the Internet, anyone can have access to
information. Goethe's Faust had wisdom and was unhappy. Today
people become dissatisfied through information. That's why there
are more Fausts today. Faust can be all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with the non-Furans Pablo Ley, who adapted and wrote the
text, and Magda Puyo, who directed the eight actors brought in for
the play, Padrissa and Olle present their ``F(AT)ust'' as a secular
morality play: the combat is not between God and the Devil, but
between the good and evil sides of Faust's personality.
Mephistopheles appears, but he may also be Faust's imaginary alter
ego. Even Faust's ill-fated teen-age mistress, Margarethe, is cast
as the universal victim of all violence against the weak.
</P>
<P>
   Faust, who has cultivated reason all his life, is unhappy and
tries to kill himself,'' Padrissa said, summarizing the plot.
``When he fails, his neglected instinctive side says to him, `Give
me your life and I will give you happiness.' That's the pact. But
when his base instincts take over, he kills Margarethe's brother,
he leaves her pregnant, she kills her baby and Faust's unhappiness
grows until he finally shoots himself. In Part II, while Goethe has
him sleeping in a field in the Alps, our Faust lies paralyzed on a
hospital bed. With no body and only a mind, he now hallucinates
being visited by mythological figures. Finally, when he awakens, he
understands that thoughts can be as dark as, well, you know, sex,
drugs and rock and roll.''
</P>
<P>
   This story is told in lenguaje furero, with Faust's struggle
lived out through images taken from the Internet, television,
advertising and live video and projected on a giant screen,
accompanied by electro-acoustical music (with breaks for Mozart's
``Requiem'') played by a disk jockey acting the part of conductor.
Padrissa and Olle cannot resist including a few machines, like one
that spins Faust head-over-heels as if in training for a space
walk. And, as always, they come up with striking visual effects:
Faust hanging in a water-filled plastic bag as an unborn embryo, or
Faust and Margarethe courting as they climb a net of thick rope,
their shadows magnified on a screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``People take time to absorb everything,'' Olle, 38, said after
a warmly applauded performance here one recent evening. ``The hope
is that the images stay with them, maybe return to them later.''

 BARCELONA, Spain: them later.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Padrissa, Olle is a company veteran, although he was not
one of the five original founders from Moya whose theatrical roots
were very much in the tradition of village fiestas. By the time he
joined in 1981, La Fura was growing rapidly _ at one point it had
30 members _ and was putting on improvised shows at alternative
sites across Barcelona. Then in 1984 the company was reduced to
just nine young men, because only nine would fit into a small van,
and began touring Catalonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment was important,'' Padrissa said. ``Franco died in
1975 and suddenly everything seemed possible. But by 1984, the
fight for freedom was over and economic recession had set in. The
dream was over for those who thought the world would change. The
reality was a lot of unemployment. The fiesta element of our work
evaporated. We created apocalyptic scenes to make people react,
like electric shock treatment. We'd smash cars, set off explosions,
burn sets, whatever. All to music.''
</P>
<P>
   With its first formal creation, ``Accions,'' in 1984, La Fura
established its theatrical language. And this was developed in five
other works that have been described as spectacles of controlled
techno-mayhem: ``Suz/o/Suz'' (which was part of the New York
International Festival of the Arts in 1991), ``Tier Mon,''
``Noun,'' ``MTM'' and, most recently, ``Manes.'' All of these have
toured widely in Europe, with the company winning a particularly
strong following in Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992, La Fura began to strike out in new directions. Until
then, its members did everything: directing, composing, building
machines and performing. However, when they presented a spectacular
show to accompany the globally televised opening of the Barcelona
Summer Olympics in 1992, they needed a cast of 1,500. And since
then, the company members _ there are seven now, all men _ have
taken to hiring actors to perform their pieces, leaving themselves
time for further diversification. Pera Tantina _ he and Padrissa
are the only members of the Moya Five to remain in La Fura _ is
involved with ``Manes''; Miki Espuma is concentrating on
composition; and Hansel Cereza, Jurgen Muller and Pep Gatelli are
currently preparing new shows.

EVOLUTION'S ADVOCATES BEGIN TACKLING PUBLIC DOUBTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ As a major scientific field,
evolutionary biology is in an extraordinary position: its basic
tenets, surveys show, are rejected as false by one of every two
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Further, at a time when an increasing number of school districts
are endorsing the teaching of creationism, evolutionary biology can
be a particularly incendiary topic in discussions of education.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the furor, though, one group has kept a surprisingly
low profile. Now that is apparently about to change. The oldest and
largest professional association of evolutionary biologists, the
Society for the Study of Evolution, an international body of some
3,500 scientists, has begun reaching out to a doubting public.
</P>
<P>
   The insular society, founded half a century ago, has long
focused on research and is hardly practiced at shaping public
opinion. It does not have a Web site or even a permanent office or
telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   But at its annual meeting here in June, where many presentations
drew audiences of 20 or fewer, overflow crowds attended the
society's first session ever devoted to educational issues.
</P>
<P>
   A room big enough to hold 150 had evolutionary biologists
spilling into the aisles and even into the hallways, eager to hear
a discussion of why their field was so poorly understood and often
so poorly taught, at all levels _ and what they could do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionary biology is no stranger to hostility, from students
inside the classroom or school boards and politicians outside. In
recent years, the Tennessee Legislature has considered a measure,
ultimately rejected, to let school boards dismiss teachers who
present evolution as fact rather than theory; a Georgia district
has endorsed the teaching of creationism, which holds that all life
forms, including humans, were fully formed by a Creator and did not
evolve, and Alabama has approved a disclaimer, to be inserted in
biology textbooks, calling evolution only ``a controversial
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   It was against such a backdrop that the evolutionary biologists
flocked to the education-issues session in Vancouver, organized by
Dr. Peter Wimberger, an evolutionary biologist at the University of
Puget Sound in Tacoma, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students don't come in doubting that F equals ma,'' Wimberger
said, referring to the familiar physics equation that force equals
mass times acceleration. ``But about half come in doubting the fact
that evolution occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting the potential power of professional societies, Irene
Eckstrand, chairwoman of the society's new education committee, led
off the session by proposing some basics like a resource list of
evolutionists willing to talk to schoolteachers and a Web site,
both of which are now being developed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she announced that the society would have an
evolution workshop and booth this November at the annual meeting of
the National Association of Biology Teachers, in Reno, where the
society will be represented by Dr. Stephen Palumbi of Harvard
University and Dr. David Jablonski of the University of Chicago.
The organization is also preparing its own teacher training
workshop for its annual meeting next year.
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers described model projects in progress, which try
to make evolution not only believable but also quite real to
students at every level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole creation-evolution issue rears its head every time
you teach,'' said Wimberger, who described a collaborative project
in which Washington state high school students collect data on
genetic variation, the basis of evolutionary change, from salmon
populations.

   ``To these students, salmon are familiar,'' Wimberger said.
``They're a cultural icon. They're the focus of conservation
issues. This gets the students doing something real.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jackie Brown of Grinnell College described experiments for
college laboratories, a rare component of evolution classes,
including one in which students go into the field and measure the
strength of natural selection on a fly. As maggots, the flies live
in plant tissue and produce a ball-like growth around themselves
known as a gall. Students discover that the chances of a maggot's
being killed by a predator or a parasite _ the strength of natural
selection _ are highly dependent on the size of its gall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It demystifies natural selection,'' Dr. Brown said of the
experiment. It is ``not something that just descends from above.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brian Alters, a science education specialist at McGill
University and Harvard, drew the largest audience of the session
with his presentation of findings on why even college students are
prone to reject evolution. Religious issues aside, the obstacles
are plentiful, said Dr. Alters, who surveyed more than 1,000
students from 10 universities across the United States and found
that they ``always came back to things that most scientists would
consider scientific misconceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Students who reject evolution, Alters determined, are much more
likely than those who accept it to subscribe to misconceptions like
believing that the methods used to date fossils and other rocks are
not accurate, that mutations are never beneficial to animals, that
it is statistically impossible for life to arise by chance and that
there is scientific evidence that humans were supernaturally
created.
</P>
<P>
   Alters reported that even in a survey of science education
graduate students _ those who will go on to careers as
schoolteachers or as teachers of teachers _ 20 percent said they
did not accept evolution (although that 20 percent said they would
teach it).
</P>
<P>
   Given findings like those, the evolutionary biologists came away
from the conference committed to more outreach and perhaps even
politics, from which they have always kept a marked distance.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike professional associations with offices in Washington, the
society ``hasn't been an advocate,'' said its secretary, Dr. Daphne
Fairbairn of Concordia University in Montreal. ``It hasn't done
lobbying or politics. We may do more of that in the future.''

PUERTO RICAN LABOR PROTEST DISRUPTS TRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ Chanting ``struggle yes, surrender no,''
strikers blocked access to San Juan's international airport for
several hours Tuesday morning on the first day of a 48-hour general
strike aimed at halting the government's sale of Puerto Rico
Telephone Co.
</P>
<P>
   The airport protest brought traffic to a standstill on San
Juan's main thoroughfare, the Baldorioty De Castro Expressway, and
forced tourists to walk for more than a mile from their buses to to
the airport terminal.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-morning, riot police, who had been surprised by the
pre-dawn blockade, reached an agreement with protesters that
allowed traffic to begin flowing back into the airport.
</P>
<P>
   But bus service was also brought to a halt in San Juan, and most
taxi drivers opted not to work in a show of solidarity. The Puerto
Rico Tourism Co. and private hotels provided transportation for
guests to and from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders said that about a half million workers from over
50 labor unions have joined the two-day strike, with picket lines
and boisterous demonstrations outside government offices, banks and
commercial centers across the island.
</P>
<P>
   Most shopping malls, including the Caribbean's largest, Plaza
Las Americas, have closed during the strike. Likewise, the island's
largest bank, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, shuttered its 198
island branches. Its parent, Popular Inc., is involved in the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Many offices and banks in the Hato Rey financial district were
also closed, as were shops in the usually bustling tourism sectors
of Old San Juan and Condado.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders prepared for the strike on Monday as if bracing for a
hurricane, with merchants erecting steel shutters over store
windows and residents stripping supermarkets bare of essentials
like water, batteries, bread and milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been very successful,'' said Annie Cruz, president of
the labor coalition the Umbrella Committee of Labor, Civic,
Cultural, Political and Religious Groups, known by its Spanish
acronym as CAOS. ``We have been able to paralyze the airport. Banco
Popular has closed. The commercial centers are closed.''
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines canceled a 7:30 a.m. Miami flight because only
59 of its 138 passengers were able to reach the airport. LIAT
airlines, based in Antigua, canceled all its San Juan flights,
while two cruise ships, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines' The Grandeur
of the Seas and Carnival Cruise Lines' Destiny, canceled scheduled
stops at San Juan harbor. Hoteliers were reporting some
cancellations as well.
</P>
<P>
   False bomb threats and fake bombs kept police on alert
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-hour strike was called last week to support 6,400
telephone company workers who walked off their jobs June 19 in an
effort to stop the sale of their company.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium led by GTE Corp. proposes to buy a 50 percent plus
one share stake in the utility in a $1.875 billion deal, which has
been approved by the governor and Legislature but still must get
Federal Communications Commission approval. Spain's Telefonica
Internacional also placed a bid for the utility, which government
officials are still considering. Workers fear a sale will lead to
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Saboteurs have inflicted an estimated $2.59 million worth of
damage on telephone company installations since the strike began.
More than 260,323 customers have had their telephone service
interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Anger at Banco Popular, which is seeking to purchase a 5 percent
stake in the telephone company as part of the GTE group, is
especially high. Two bombs have exploded at bank branches, One of
them blowing off a policeman's finger. Overnight, gunmen also
riddled one San Juan branch with bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the unions participating in the strike represent workers
for government public corporations that control essential services
such as water and electricity. Other unions represent airport, port
and bus workers. No widespread electric or water outages were
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Private sector unions, from teamsters to hotel workers, also
took part in the strike. Their concerns go beyond the sale of the
telephone company, because the administration of Gov. Pedro
Rossello has launched an aggressive campaign to sell government
hotels, hospitals and other assets. The unions accuse the
pro-statehood administration of selling the national patrimony.
</P>
<P>
   The governor remained steadfast on selling the telephone
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't change our determination to sell La Telefonica,''
Rossello said at a mid-day news conference. ``These decisions
aren't taken by intimidation. They aren't taken by who pushes more
or who shouts louder. They are taken on the basis of what is
reasonable, and what is best for the common good.''
</P>
<P>
   A previous attempt to sell the telephone company in 1990 under
former Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon failed because of large labor
protests and political opposition. &QL;

MAKING THREATS AND LOSING CASH IN GM STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ A monthlong strike by the United Automobile
Workers against General Motors Corp. is starting to drain the cash
reserves of both sides and is prompting GM in particular to begin
reviewing ways to save money.
</P>
<P>
   GM and the UAW both have enormous financial strength, and
neither needs to call a truce soon for lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   But the erosion of GM's market share as the company's dealers
run out of cars and light trucks poses a more serious risk to the
company and its employees. Some lost customers may defect to rival
automakers and never come back, GM executives warn, and some UAW
officials privately acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators participated in lengthy meetings Tuesday as both
sides struggled to settle the dispute, which began with a quarrel
over whether workers at a parts factory were collecting a full
day's pay for four to six hours of work and over whether GM had
broken a promise to invest more money here.
</P>
<P>
   GM has raised the stakes by threatening to close some of its car
factories permanently to become more competitive. The UAW has
responded by threatening further strikes this autumn at important
parts factories in Dayton, Ohio, and Indianapolis, where workers
also want GM to increase investment.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shoemaker, the UAW's vice president for GM issues, said
that the union would like to settle outstanding issues at the
Dayton and Indianapolis factories as part of a deal here.
</P>
<P>
   But while both sides would like a deal by Thursday, which would
allow a ratification vote over the weekend and a resumption of
production Monday, the growing number of disputes has made it
harder to reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
   A constant worry for the union is that if GM is pushed too far,
it might simply sell Delphi Automotive Systems, its sprawling auto
parts subsidiary. A new owner would be a tough bargaining opponent
for the UAW, because the new owner would not have the numerous,
high-cost assembly plants that make GM vulnerable to UAW strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite union objections, GM sold four parts factories in 1996
to Peregrine Inc., an auto parts company. Peregrine announced
Tuesday night that it would close two of the factories: one here in
Flint and the other in Livonia, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   All 1,000 UAW workers at the two closed factories will be
allowed to transfer back to GM under a deal negotiated by the UAW
two years ago, but the closings confirmed some of the union's worst
fears.
</P>
<P>
   The company has already said that the strike cost it $1.18
billion in after-tax losses during the second quarter, but in
recent days GM officials have been expressing more concern about
the strike's effects on the company's $13.6 billion in cash
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The last big UAW strike against GM, a 17-day walkout in 1996,
temporarily reduced the company's cash reserves by $2.3 billion, as
the company continued to pay the salaries of white-collar employees
and bills from outside suppliers of auto parts, but no longer took
in money from selling new cars and light trucks to dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The current strike has lasted 32 days, although the last 11 days
have fallen during the company's annual two-week summer shutdown,
when GM always experiences a temporary drain of cash. Donald
Hackworth, GM's group vice president for North American car
operations, said Tuesday that the company was seeking to reduce the
outflow of cash.GM
</P>
<P>
   GM has already taken many small steps to stanch the loss of
cash. It has turned the power off at assembly plants closed by the
strike, a step that will add a day or two to the time needed to
restart them later. GM has also cut back on business travel,
off-site meetings and the use of consultants.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street analysts said GM had enough cash for a prolonged
confrontation. ``It's going to take a very, very long time for GM
to face any real liquidity concerns as a result of the strike,''
said Scott Sprinzen, the chief auto credit analyst at Standard &AMP;
Poor's. GM can easily borrow money or sell car loans to raise
money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Girsky, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley, said that in
addition to the $1.18 billion in lost profits, GM's cash reserves
had likely fallen by an additional $3 billion as bills came due for
auto parts purchased before the strike. The impact on the cash
reserves should now slow, he said, as GM stops further purchases of
parts and because the company has laid off many workers.
</P>
<P>
   The union is also finding the strike expensive, but, like the
company, can afford to continue on its course. While union
officials refuse to provide precise numbers, the strike appears to
have taken about $10 million so far from a $725 million strike
fund, which is one of the largest in organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has been paying $150 a week in strike benefits to 9,200
striking workers here, and has been covering their health care
costs since July 1, when GM stopped its medical coverage for them.
</P>
<P>
   GM has filed petitions with state governments asking that they
not pay unemployment benefits to nearly 120,000 UAW workers that GM
has laid off, because GM contends that they are indirectly involved
in the strike through their union membership and therefore should
be ineligible for unemployment compensation. GM filed similar
petitions in 1996, and while most states rejected them, Texas
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, union officials said that they had already decided
to pay $150 a week in strike benefits to 1,400 workers at a sport
utility vehicle factory in Arlington, Texas. The workers would have
to repay the money if Texas later decided to pay unemployment
benefits anyway. &QL;

EVEN WITH NEW TOOLS, FLORIDA FIRES PRESENT A HUGE CHALLENGE

<P>
   Tools for fighting wildfires these days include airplanes to
dump chemicals and water, satellites to locate hot-spots and laptop
computers to keep track of blazes, trucks and people. But the
firefighters' basic technique has been the same for decades: trying
to throw a defensive perimeter around each fire, and praying for
rain.
</P>
<P>
   The essential work of firefighting is cutting down trees and
shrubs and building a dead zone with no fuel, because putting them
out in a large area is beyond human resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forest fires are monumental challenges,'' said Patrick
Reynolds, an assistant professor at a University of Cincinnati
program for training firefighters. Unlike house fires, wildfires
face few natural boundaries and have a continuous source of fuel,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Florida presents special challenges because of its lush
growth and its topography _ what there is of it. Unlike the western
United States, where firefighters can look down from mountaintops
to see fires, or stand in valleys and watch them climb ridges,
Florida is so flat that seeing a fire's progress from the ground is
nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant shrubs and a thick carpet of roots and decaying
vegetation also can shelter and nurture a fire for days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have a storm come through there and a few days later
it's burning again,'' said Jason Greenlee, executive director of
the International Association of Wildland Fire, in Spokane, Wash.
Even after an inch or two of rain, he said, ``once the sun comes
out, that moisture's being evaporated off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're really going to need a good gully-washer to put these
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers Tuesday did little to put out the small fires
that continued to smolder among the burned trees, The Associated
Press reported. Fifty-four new fires broke out statewide on Monday,
burning 8,700 new acres, according to AP.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is a ``fire-dependent ecosystem,'' said David Bunnell, a
forester at the Department of Agriculture, but this is not the kind
it needs. Bunnell, based at the Interagency Fire Center in Boise,
Idaho, said that the native pine species, loblolly, long leaf and
sand pine, are fire-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   In small fires, as the bark heats up, flakes pop off the tree
before they burn, so that a fire must heat a new area of bark. But
those fires kill off oaks and other deciduous invaders, he said,
allowing the native pines to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   The natural system is based on fires every three to five years,
he said, and in places where people build their houses out in the
woods, ``social values'' intervene, meaning people impose their
preferences on nature.
</P>
<P>
   The small fires that would ordinarily clean out the undergrowth
of palmetto and gallberry are routinely extinguished by
firefighters before they can do so, he said, and ``prescriptive
fires,'' often ordered by forest managers to prevent such
build-ups, are banned because the forests' new neighbors see them
as smoke-causing nuisances, or threats.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Bunnell said, in an especially dry year, the fires catch
up, and what follows kills everything.
</P>
<P>
   But the new tools now available can help firefighters intervene.
One tool is better weather forecasting, which can tell firefighters
when to expect strong winds or rain. Another is a hand-held
navigation unit that uses a global positioning system to keep
firefighters from getting lost. It can tell managers by radio
precisely where the fires and firefighters are.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline-powered pumps that can feed thousands of gallons from a
pond through a hose are now built light enough to be carried easily
by one person. New chain saws are designed better so they overheat
less often.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, firefighters use aircraft. Many are antiques like
DC-3s retrofitted for the job or military cast-off C-130's. One in
use now in Florida, a Canadair CL-415, a twin-engine turboprop,
skims over a lake or bay at 115 mph and lowers two probes that
scoop up 1,600 gallons in 12 seconds. Aloft gain, it can mix a
fire-retardant thickener into the water, so the foam it drops will
cling to vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   If the water source is near the fire, the Canadair can make 20
drops an hour or more, compared with one drop every 45 to 60
minutes for planes that must land at an airport, taxi to a loading
point, fill up and take off again. The plane, on loan from North
Carolina and operating this week out of Deland, Fla., can soak an
area 440 feet long and 50 feet wide, or 350 feet long and 80 feet
wide, depending on how the pilot drops his slug of water.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters can be even more precise and can dunk buckets into
water sources as small as swimming pools for quick runs back to the
target zones.
</P>
<P>
   But the fires can easily dwarf the resources. ``Even when we're
working with hoses and aircraft, we're only working the outer edge
of the fire,'' said Greenlee, the fire agency director, who works
part of each year as a smoke jumper. ``Once you get a fire
contained, maybe the order of the day will be, we're going to mop
up 100 yards in from the fire line. The next day, it might be 150
yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell, the agriculture department forester, said that in an
average year, firefighters could hope to surround some fires and
then march in and put some out. But, with a dry year and lots of
fuel available because of paucity of fires in the last few years,
he said, ``we cannot overwhelm this part of the natural process
with personnel and equipment and expertise.'' &QL;

APPEALS COURT RULES SECRET SERVICE OFFICIALS MUST TESTIFY IN
LEWINSKY INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dealing a sharp setback to the Clinton
administration, a federal appeals court on Tuesday ordered Secret
Service officials to testify before a grand jury about what they
knew of any relationship between President Clinton and Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision handed down with unusual speed, the
three-judge panel rejected the Clinton administration's claim that
the Secret Service enjoyed a special privilege that was essential
to the president's safety and that shielded its officials from
having to testify. The judges said it was up to Congress to decide
whether to grant such a privilege.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision broadly dismissed the administration's claim
of a novel ``protective function privilege,'' it is not known
whether the ruling would have any practical effect on the inquiry
into whether anyone lied or obstructed justice about the
president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment suit. The independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, who
has suffered some legal setbacks in recent weeks, has been pressing
for months for the testimony of two uniformed officers and the
service's chief counsel. His investigators want to determine if the
officers discussed Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern, with
the counsel, according to lawyers involved in the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Secret Service have said that they know of no
witnesses to anything improper involving Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky.
But with Tuesday's ruling, Starr's investigators can begin to
question more closely all of the guards and agents who watch over
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said on Tuesday that they had not
decided whether to seek an appeal of the decision by the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia .
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Service and the Justice Department are disappointed
by the D.C. Circuit's decision,'' said Bert Brandenburg, the
Justice Department's chief spokesman. ``We continue to be concerned
that any action that could distance the Secret Service from the
president increases the danger to his life and that of future
presidents. We are reviewing whether to appeal, and hope to have a
decision soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service had argued that if Starr established a legal
precedent by compelling agents to testify about the private lives
of the first family, Clinton and future presidents would push their
guards away, making protection impossible and risking future
assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision rejected that argument, noting that former
Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter had said that agents should
testify in a criminal case and that a federal law obliges all
presidents to accept protection.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing concerns raised by the director of the Secret Service
and many current and retired agents, the judges said concern over
whether a president keeps Secret Service agents at a distance was
unnecessary because of the president's own self-interest in having
his bodyguards stay close, regardless of the law governing
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has a profound personal interest in being well
protected, and the president knows that effective protection
depends upon proximity to his protectors,'' the judges said,
paraphrasing a lower court decision that was affirmed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel, Judges Douglas Ginsburg, A. Raymond Randolph
and Stephen Williams, appeared to craft a carefully written opinion
that did not address some of the broader issues on the law
governing privileges. As such, the opinion does not appear to have
any direct impact on a second legal dispute, widely regarded as a
closer case, that is now before a different federal appeals panel
here. That case involves whether one of Clinton's closest aides,
Bruce Lindsey, can refuse to answer some grand jury questions on
the ground that they are protected by the lawyer-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which has said that it is not involved in the
dispute between the Secret Service and the independent counsel,
declined to comment about Tuesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Starr hailed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fundamental in our country that all law enforcement
officers cooperate fully in responding to requests for relevant
information in a federal grand jury investigation,'' he said in a
brief written statement. ``The Court of Appeals today reaffirmed
that bedrock principle, emphasizing that the rule of law is not
incompatible with the profound national interest in protecting the
life of the President. We trust that the Secret Service will now
join us in helping the grand jury gather information that is
relevant to this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr has sought grand jury testimony from John Kelleher, the
chief counsel of the Secret Service, and from two uniformed
officers, Gary Byrne and Brian Henderson, according to lawyers
involved in the appeal. They said that investigators want to know
whether Byrne and Henderson discussed Ms. Lewinsky with Kelleher.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported that Byrne told Evelyn Lieberman, then
deputy chief of staff at the White House, in the spring of 1996
that he had seen Ms. Lewinsky in the West Wing when he did not
believe she was authorized to be there. Ms. Lieberman has said she
removed Ms. Lewinsky from her White House job at around that time
because of ``immature and inappropriate behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The precise issue before the appeals court was whether Rule 501
of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the main rule on privileges,
should be interpreted so as to shield Secret Service officials and
agents from testimony about the president. The Secret Service has
already testified about a wide variety of matters at the White
House in the Lewinsky matter not directly involving Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks ago, federal district Judge Norma Holloway Johnson,
who is overseeing the grand jury inquiry into the Lewinsky
investigation, ruled that the agents can be compelled to testify.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In affirming that decision on Tuesday, the appeals court judges
found that the administration had failed to show by a clear and
convincing standard ``both the need for and the efficacy of the
proposed privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As for need, the greatest danger to the President arises when
he is in public, yet the privilege presumably would have its
greatest effect when he is in the White House or in private
meetings,'' the court said. ``As for efficacy, we suspect that even
with a protective function privilege in place, conscience might
impel a President to distance himself from Secret Service agents
when engaging in wrongful conduct, as might a simple desire for
privacy at other times.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges rejected the administration's claim as to which
official can invoke the privilege, how long such a privilege might
last, whether the administration could use it to limit the
testimony of retired agents and how broadly it could be applied.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that the Secret Service does not require its agents
to sign confidentiality agreements and that it was unusual for the
administration to claim that the secretary of the Treasury holds
the privilege, not the president. The Treasury oversees the Secret
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Secret Service have been the most forceful
advocates of the proposed privilege, making it clear that, were it
up to them, they would take the matter to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But the final decision about an appeal rests with Attorney
General Janet Reno and the solicitor general, Seth Waxman. With the
administration having to rely on policy arguments because of the
dearth of legal precedent for such a privilege, some Justice
Department officials had previously cautioned against any appeals.
</P>
<P>
   If the administration does decide to seek a further review, it
has three options.
</P>
<P>
   It has seven days to decide whether to seek a rehearing before
the three judges or a hearing by the full appeals court. Or it
could file an appeal to the Supreme Court. The rules gives the
Justice Department 90 days to seek such an appeal, although the
independent counsel could try to force the issue by once again
calling Secret Service officers to the grand jury.

1.2 MILLION IN HOUSTON AREA HAVE NO HEALTH INSURANCE, STUDY
INDICATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional trims) 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Almost one-third of the Houston-area population has
no health insurance, the highest percentage of uninsured among the
nation's largest metropolitan areas, a recent study indicates.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by the Employee Benefit Research Institute,
used 1996 census bureau samplings to determine that about 1.2
million people, or 30.1 percent of the people in the eight-county
Houston metropolitan area, did not have health insurance. That
compares to a 18.2 percent average for 18 metropolitan areas
included in the study, and a 17.7 percent average nationwide. The
study excludes the elderly, who receive federal health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The large number of uninsured in the Houston area is due to
factors common in a number of southern and southwest states that
traditionally have large numbers of uninsured, said Ken McDonnell,
an analyst with the Washington-based institute.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor, which has been successful in bargaining for
health-care benefits for its members, does not have a major
presence in Houston, he said. By contrast the Detroit area, with
its large number of unionized automotive workers, has an uninsured
rate of 9.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the region has a high percentage of Hispanics, many of
them noncitizens who do not qualify for public programs such as
Medicaid. Los Angeles and Miami, the metropolitan areas in the
study with uninsured rates approaching Houston's level, also have
large Hispanic populations.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, state and local governments in Texas have not
traditionally provided for the poor and unemployed as generously as
governments in other parts of the country, particularly the
northeast.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the New York metropolitan area, about 14.4
percent of the population is enrolled in Medicaid, the
state-administered health insurance program for the poor. By
contrast about 8.9 percent of individuals in Houston are on
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern states are nonactivists. You don't see Texas
extending a lot of its Medicaid services to a lot of its people,''
McDonnell said.
</P>
<P>
   However, those reasons do not explain why the Houston rate is
higher than the 26.7 percent average for Texas and the 21.5 percent
average for the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, a smaller percentage of people are on Medicaid than
in Houston, but a much larger percentage get their health care
through their employers. In Dallas about 66.9 percent have
employer-based coverage compared to 57.2 percent in the Houston
area.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the federally defined Houston Consolidated
Metropolitan Statistical Area included Brazoria, Chambers, Fort
Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery and Waller counties.
</P>
<P>
   Health and insurance officials in Texas could not explain the
high rates for the Houston area, with several saying that earlier
studies showed the region ranked average among large cities. Those
studies could have encompassed larger or smaller areas and used
different census samples, McDonnell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why Houston would be higher than the rest of the state, that's
a tough one,'' said Lee Jones, a spokesman for the Texas Department
of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year the state started a high-risk insurance pool for those
who have trouble getting health insurance. The program was set up
to comply with a new federal law that prohibits insurance companies
from dropping people with medical conditions or when they change
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in January the program has enrolled 1,202
people _ a number not likely to make much of a dent in the
uninsured in the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jones suggested that there are various reasons why people don't
have health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people don't want it,'' he said, relating how some
workers would rather have bigger paycheck than benefits.
</P>
<P>
   However a union official said that the Houston area has long
been known as a low wage region where employers shun paying
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there is a union presence you will have benefits and
where there isn't one you likely will not find them,'' said Richard
Shaw, the secretary treasurer of the Harris County chapter of the
AFL -CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said there are about 60,000 unionized workers in Harris
County, all of whom have health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hickman, who works for Watson Wyatt &AMP; Company, a benefits
consulting firm in Houston, speculated that the region may have a
high number of uninsured because of the large number of small
businesses that either offer no benefits or require an extremely
high co-payment by employees.
</P>
<P>
   Even though people may not have health insurance many still get
medical treatment and end up in taxpayer-funded facilities such as
those run by the Harris County Hospital District.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of health insurance was a major issue during
President Clinton's first two years in office when he proposed a
complex and ambitious plan to guarantee that all Americans have
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   That plan was buried after it met fierce opposition from
employer groups and the insurance industry. However, the issue has
not gone away.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the booming economy, about 3 million more people are
without health insurance now than when Clinton first took office,
according to the EBRI analysis, for a total of 41.4 million
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell said that many individuals who were laid off by large
corporations during the last recession had to settle for new jobs
that did not offer the same health care benefits. However, since
1993, the biggest reason for the increase in the uninsured has been
the decline in public sources for health insurance, such as the
military.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton announced he was moving to penalize
insurance companies that are not complying with a 1996 law that
bars health insurers from dropping people who change jobs or have
certain medical conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Government Accounting Office study found that some of
the large insurers were either charging exorbitantly high rates or
discouraging consumers from applying for policies under the new
law.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that insurers found to be violating the law would
be barred from participating in the Federal Employees Health
Benefits Program, which covers nine million people through 350
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The health care issue will be high on Congress' agenda next
week, when the House GOP leadership expects to introduce
legislation that provides some regulation of managed care plans,
including giving individuals more ability to appeal decisions made
by their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   That GOP bill also is expected to give trade associations the
ability to offer health plans to many of their members who may not
now be able to afford health care benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have signaled they intend to make health care an
election year issue, charging that Republicans are not sufficiently
responding to the public's dissatisfaction with managed care.

BEING A GOOD CITIZEN IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Employers, whose low opinion of American public education has
generated much alarm in recent years, have come under growing
pressure to get involved with their local high schools by offering
everything from materials to tutorials about the world of work.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the first nationwide study of corporate participation in
schools shows that by doing good, companies are also doing well.
Those that have worked closely with their local high schools show a
turnover rate among young employees that is as low as half that of
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the study shows, companies with close school
involvement look far more carefully at high school transcripts as a
basis for hiring decisions, something educators have been pushing
to raise their students' achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental question that keeps being asked is, `Is being
a good corporate citizen good for business?''' said Robert Zemsky,
director of the Institute for Research on Higher Education at the
University of Pennsylvania, which carried out the study. ``This is
the first broad-based demonstration that employers who fit a common
definition of good citizen run their businesses differently, in
particular with regard to how young workers view them, and benefit
from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The data are from the 1997 National Employer Survey,
administered by the Bureau of the Census, and involved a
representative sampling of all private businesses with 20 or more
employees. About 5,400 establishments responded to a telephone
survey, a response rate of 78 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study classified about 25 percent of businesses as strongly
involved with schools, meaning they engaged in at least eight
activities listed by the researchers, like visiting classes,
tutoring, sponsoring clubs and assisting with curriculum
development.
</P>
<P>
   When comparing the annual rates for resignations and dismissals
of workers 18 to 25 years old within that group of companies, the
researchers said, the involved companies had ``a young-worker
turnover rate that is half the youth turnover rate for employers
that do not actively participate with high schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By actively engaging their local education systems,'' the
researchers said, ``establishments may be helping to generate a
future labor force that is more stable, more work-ready, and
presumably better matched to the workplace of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The data show a gradual drop in the rates of youth employee
turnover to 25 percent for companies with extensive involvement
from 50 percent among companies with little or no school
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The paper, written by Daniel Shapiro of the University of
Pennsylvania and Maria Iannozzi, an education writer, is to be
published in the September issue of The Annals of the American
Academy of Political and Social Science.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Census Bureau's survey was taken with guarantees of
anonymity, the researchers have not been able to follow up with
specific employers. The scholars said they needed to focus future
research on whether certain kinds of involvement produced the
retention results.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Phyllis Eisen, executive director of the Center for
Workforce Success at the National Association of Manufacturers,
said the study was significant. Many people have been arguing for
the value of corporate involvement in schools but there have been
virtually no data demonstrating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our organization's top priority _ to close the skills
gap and disconnect between school and work,'' Ms. Eisen said. ``In
this tight job market, we have seen a continuing trend of companies
worrying about the pipeline of future workers. Given their ongoing
anxiety about what high schools are producing, they are realizing
that they have to get more involved.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that companies were also motivated to help improve
local schools because potential employees being recruited from
other cities considered the quality of local schools to be among
the most important criteria in deciding whether to accept a job
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, employee turnover, especially among young workers, is
a source of great concern for businesses. Most transitions from
school to work are rocky with wasted time and many mismatches,
producing problems for young people and for the national economy.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much attention in recent years to school-to-work
programs modeled on apprenticeships in Europe. But Zemsky said
Americans seemed to require a different model. Instead of systems,
he said, Americans build informal networks.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, businesses have tended to run apprenticeships through
powerful guilds or chambers of commerce. But in this country, there
has been little appetite for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we find works is flexible and nonformulaic,'' Professor
Zemsky said. ``We want to make these young people more purposeful
and explicitly show them that if they want to work they have to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Milton Goldberg, executive vice president of the National
Alliance of Business, a nonprofit pro-business organization, said
he was pleased to hear about the emphasis on high school
transcripts. His group has started a campaign to increase the
importance of high school transcripts in hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early evidence suggests that, as a result of the campaign,
course-taking patterns are changing and schools' knowledge of what
companies want is improving,'' Goldberg said. ``We are also trying
to change transcripts so they give more information useful to
employers, like attitudes and teamwork skills.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that evidence was growing that when companies sent
representatives to schools, students were more motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly algebra and geometry in constructing a tractor become
real,'' Goldberg said. ``It is clear that when schools and
businesses communicate with one another and provide opportunities
for one another, it makes learning for youngsters far more relevant
to the world outside. Businesses are beginning to understand that
the quality of education is strongly related to the quality of life
in a community and that, in turn, is crucial for businesses.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the abrupt death Tuesday of Nigeria's most prominent
civilian politician, Moshood K.O. Abiola, Nigeria has suddenly lost
in the space of only one month the two leaders whose rivalry has
locked this country in a costly four-year stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   When Abiola's one-time friend and, more recently, jailer and
tormentor, President Sani Abacha, died last month, many Nigerians
were relieved, saying that finally, with the steel-fisted dictator
gone, political life could at last move forward.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition wanted Abiola proclaimed the rightful president
because he was clearly winning the 1993 elections before the
military annulled them. But the seemingly more moderate generals
who succeeded Abacha balked at the idea of Abiola as president.
Instead, the new government and, Nigerian opposition figures say,
some Western diplomats appeared set on persuading Abiola that he
had no claim on the presidency and should gracefully fade from the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   At one level Abiola's death, apparently after a heart attack,
would seem to settle the issue neatly.
</P>
<P>
   But in a country where few events _ especially sudden deaths _
rest on their readiest interpretations, where ethnic and regional
divisions remain immense and where the military's history of
dominating politics is so complete, Abiola's surprising end is only
likely to further complicate matters, at least in the turbulent
short term.
</P>
<P>
   There is already considerable resentment in Nigeria about what
is seen as a failure on the part of Western powers to demand that
the military turn over government tg civilian democratic rule. Add
to this Abiola's death, and the main result is a potentially
explosive situation in which everyone distrusts everyone else,
including the outside brokers who come to help ease the country
forward.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance the outsider is the U.N. secretary-general,
Kofi Annan, who came to Nigeria last week and announced after a
meeting with Abiola that the politician wanted to ``get on with his
life'' and would no longer insist on claiming the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola's family and close supporters immediately disputed these
statements and asked bitterly why the jailed politician had not
been allowed to speak to the nation directly, or even meet with his
own advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's visit was followed on Tuesday by that of Thomas
Pickering, the U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs
and a former ambassador to Nigeria, who met with Nigeria's new
leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, and was with Abiola when he
became ill.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats in Pickering's delegation said they had come to
Nigeria to insist on the release of all political prisoners, a
return to civilian rule and an early date for new elections.
Conspicuously absent, however, was any demand for a formal
political role for Abiola, the presumed winner of what have been
widely called the country's most democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
   In comments not intended for attribution, Western diplomats have
told journalists that Abiola's 1993 election can no longer be
considered valid, and it is widely assumed that they, like Annan,
were seeking to ease Abiola from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of these missions was good in theory if they were
aimed at pressuring the government to release Abiola and the other
prisoners and get on with elections,'' said Walter Carrington, a
recent U.S. ambassador to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``But starting with Annan's statements about renouncing a claim
to the presidency, any effort to get Abiola to relinquish his
mandate was very wrong. We should have insisted on his
unconditional release and that he be allowed to meet with his
supporters and not be forced to make agreements under duress.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the opposition have said Washington's policy is more
concerned with oil interests than with democracy. Nigeria is an
important supplier of oil to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although its source is hard to pinpoint, Western ambivalence
toward Abiola is longstanding. After the 1993 elections were
annulled, Washington and London protested for a time, but then
stopped short of seeking validation for the results.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Western diplomats routinely urged the government to
release Abiola on humanitarian grounds, but never dwelled on his
presumed mandate or political legitimacy. The reasons for this
ambivalence, always invoked off the record, ranged from his
supposedly mercurial character to the demands he made for Western
reparations for the African slave trade, to his supposed contacts
with Nigerian drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his shady business dealings with military leaders,
including Abacha himself, and high-level involvement in the heavily
corrupt civilian politics of the 1980s, Abiola's more recent
democratic credentials were as solid as they come in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian government officials and Western diplomats alike
acknowledge that in the 1993 race, Abiola, a millionaire
businessman, was winning in every region of this traditionally
polarized country. This included leading his rival, Bashir Tofa, in
his heavily Muslim native city, Kano, in the far north.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola's acceptance outside his native southwest was helped by
his conversion to Islam long ago, and a history of deep-pocket
philanthropy that spread to every region.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerian reaction to Abiola's death, and to the latest
diplomacy, has been swift and powerfully bitter, particularly in
the southwest, where his Yoruba ethnic group _ one of the nation's
three largest _ deeply resents what it sees as yet another chapter
in its deliberate exclusion from power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in Nigeria will believe that M.K.O. Abiola renounced
the presidency,'' said Gani Fawehinmi, leader of the Joint Action
Committee of Nigeria, a major umbrella group of anti-military
opposition forces. ``What people will rather believe is that all of
the pressure being placed on him killed Abiola. But those who
wanted to be rid of Abiola will soon wish that he was back.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with reports of scattered unrest spreading through Lagos
and other parts of the Yoruba southwest, the liability of not
having Abiola around as a calming factor is already apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chief Abiola was the closest thing this nation had to a
leader,'' said Emanuel Ibru, a member of the opposition alliance
Nadeco. ``We are not just in shock and mourning; we are leaderless
now, and that is a very dangerous thing.''

MOTOROLA CITES SMALL PROFIT, AFTER FORECASTING LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Motorola Inc., which warned Wall Street last month
that it was headed for its first losing quarter in 13 years, said
late Tuesday that it had instead managed to eke out a small
operating profit.
</P>
<P>
   Before a one-time charge, the company earned $6 million, or 1
cent a diluted share, in the second quarter, which ended June 27.
Analysts had expected a loss of 4 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was little sign behind the numbers that Motorola's
woes in its semiconductor and wireless communications markets had
bottomed out. Total revenue was $7.02 billion, down 6.6 percent
from $7.52 billion in the second quarter of 1997, and new orders
were down even more than sales in most of Motorola's major business
segments.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we indicated last month, the second-quarter results reflect
the further slowing of demand and continuing global pricing
pressure,'' said Robert Growney, Motorola's president and chief
operating officer, adding that the declines were ``driven primarily
by economic conditions in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola chief executive Christopher Galvin warned that Asia
would continue to hurt the company for at least the remainder of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The company released its results after the stock market closed.
Earlier, its shares rose $1.4375, or 2.7 percent, to $55. For the
year, its shares are down 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola had been regarded as a bellwether for the entire
technology sector and a major influence on the stock market because
it is among the first companies to report quarterly earnings. But
its results have increasingly been regarded as a suspect indicator
by analysts because many of its earnings disappointments in recent
quarters have been linked to a failure to keep up with innovation
in its key businesses rather than to general market conditions. The
company is still seen as a barometer of conditions in Asia because
it is among the leading multinational investors there, and
Tuesday's news was not very cheerful.
</P>
<P>
   Growney reported, for instance, that sales of Motorola's
semiconductor products fell nearly 11 percent, to $1.81 billion
from $2.03 billion, but that new orders fell 25 percent, led by a
large drop in Japan and Asia. The segment of the company that
includes paging took an even larger hit, with sales falling 35
percent, to $771 million. The decline hit North America but was
worse in the huge Chinese market, where pagers are often used as an
alternative to the primitive phone system.
</P>
<P>
   A similar pattern held in the cellular phone business, where
sales fell 1 percent, to $2.78 billion, while new orders tumbled 11
percent, led down by Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orders in their core businesses were pretty ugly,'' said Mark
McKechnie, an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian economic woes hit Motorola in two ways, cutting demand
for products in a region where it once enjoyed booming growth while
also weakening Asian currencies enough to make Asian electronics
manufacturers more competitive with Motorola all over the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Mo4orola said that its previously announced plans to cut its
work force, close some semiconductor and paging operations and sell
off money-losing operations resulted in a $1.91 billion pretax
charge against earnings in the quarter, resulting in a net loss of
$1.3 billion, or $2.22 a fully diluted share, compared with
earnings of $268 million, or 44 cents a share, in the comparable
quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The year-earlier quarter included a charge against earnings of
$190 million, or 20 cents a share after taxes, to cover the cost of
exiting memory chip operations.
</P>
<P>
   Growney repeated the company's projection that a planned
revamping should produce annual saving of $750 million a year once
it is completed next summer. Motorola has also told analysts to
expect news soon about the long-awaited introduction of a new
generation of digital cellular phones. &QL;

ALFRED FROMM, 93, EARLY LEADER IN THE CALIFORNIA WINE INDUSTRY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alfred Fromm, a leader in the early days of the California wine
industry, died at his home in San Francisco on Thursday. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Fromm was born in Kitzingen, Bavaria, the fourth generation of a
family of wine makers at Bingen on the Rhine. Fleeing from the
Nazis, in 1936 he came to the United States, where he founded Fpomm
&AMP; Sichel Inc. with Franz Sichel, another expatriate scion of an old
German wine-making clan. Fromm &AMP; Sichel distributed the Christian
Brothers wine and brandy worldwide and in the 1950s took over the
Paul Masson vineyards, a pioneering California wine maker in
Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   Fromm, who was also known as a philanthropist, founded the Wine
Museum of San Francisco and co-founded the San Francisco Jewish
Community Museum. In 1976, with his wife, Hanna, he founded and
financed the Fromm Institute for Lifelong Learning, a program of
courses at the University of San Francisco taught by emeritus
professors for retired people over the age of 50. For this work,
the Fromms were awarded honorary doctorates of public service in
1979, the same year they established a sister program, the Fromm
Institute at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Though he built his fortune on jug wines such as California
chablis, and Paul Masson's slightly sweet champagne, Fromm was
among the first to predict that California wines would come to
rival those of France in both quantity and quality. In the late
1950s, he predicted the emergence, within five years, of a dozen or
more nationally distributed wines with consistency and brand
recognition to equal any consumer product.
</P>
<P>
   Fromm was a director of the San Francisco Opera Association,
trustee of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, governor of the
Jewish National Fund and a member of the board of the Culinary
Institute of America. He was appointed a regent at St. Mary's
College in Moraga, Calif., where he was awarded an honorary
doctorate of humane letters. He established scholarships at
Brandeis University and Hastings College of Law and served on the
advisory board of the California State University of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Fromm is survived by two children,
David Fromm, of Detroit, who is chief of surgery at Wayne State
University, and Caroline Fromm-Lurie, of Ross, Calif., a
psychotherapist and president of the Friends of the Fromm
Institute; five grandchildren; and great-grandchildren.

BEHIND THE CURTAIN AND INTO THE BRUTAL LAND OF 'OZ' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 12.)  
 (JT)  
 By PAULA SCHWARTZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't look for Dorothy or Toto. That's the other place. This is
Oz, short for Oswald Maximum Security Penitentiary. Emerald City,
the high-tech experimental prison-within-a-prison _ referred to as
Em City _ stresses rehabilitation. It's run by Tim McManus (Terry
Kinney), a 1960s throwback who believes even the most hardened
criminal can change. Ernie Hudson plays his boss, the warden, a
forceful authority figure who knows better.
</P>
<P>
   The critically acclaimed HBO drama series begins its second
eight-episode season July 13 at 10 p.m. (after sneak previews July
11 and 12.) All the episodes are written by Tom Fontana, who is
co-executive producer with Barry Levinson. They are also
responsible for NBC's ``Homicide: Life on the Street.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Homicide'' is gritty, ``Oz'' is off the charts. It has full
frontal nudity, four-letter words and lots of sex and violence and
specializes in relentlessly gruesome details (like a close-up of a
charcoal-broiled prisoner or a man with a fork stuck in his neck).
There's a strong cringe factor.
</P>
<P>
   Things got difficult for the inmates last season. There were
warring ethnic groups and scores to settle, along with outside
forces like budget cuts and political backstabbing. Then officials
took away conjugal visits. A riot in the final episode left six
prisoners and two guards dead.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months later, as the new season begins, Oz reopens. Who
survived? At the beginning of last season no one would have banked
on Tobias Beecher (Lee Tergesen). The meek yuppie lawyer, jailed
for vehicular manslaughter, was almost normal. But that was before
he was beaten, sodomized, branded with a swastika and forced to
sing ``I've Got It Bad and That Ain't Good'' in drag. That's bound
to make a man mean. And the angel dust didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   Only one man was not laughing while Beecher was forced to sing
his torch song in front of the entire prison population. That was
Ryan O'Reilly, standing in the shadows, leaning against a wall,
scheming, trying to figure out how he could use Beecher to his
advantage. The angel dust was his gift.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly is smart. He's easily the most dangerous character in
Oz. And not only because he forced a prisoner to eat ground-up
glass. He's Iago to Beecher's Othello.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who died at Oz died directly or indirectly because of
O'Reilly,'' explains Dean Winters, the young New York actor who
plays the role. Yet if Internet interest is any indication,
O'Reilly is clearly the series' most popular character.
</P>
<P>
   Winters never expected that kind of fan adulation. ``I'm amazed
at the reaction to the character, especially on the street,'' he
says. ``They come up to me and profess their undying love for
O'Reilly. I mean, you have to wonder about those people.''

CHANCELLOR MAKES A FORAY INTO TV WITH LIN PURCHASE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CAROL MARIE CROPPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Chancellor Media Corp., the second-largest radio
company in the country, announced Tuesday that it would enter the
television industry with the acquisition of Lin Television Corp.
for about $902.7 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Lin, about 70 percent of which is owned by the buyout firm
Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, owns or operates 12 network-affiliated
stations in places like Connecticut, Buffalo, N.Y., and
Indianapolis, and has minority interests in NBC affiliates in
Dallas and San Diego. It is the 22nd-largest television broadcaster
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor owns and operates 108 radio stations in 22 of the
largest markets in the nation and has a combined weekly listener
base of more than 46 million people. Only the CBS collection of
radio stations is larger.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, Muse, which is based in Dallas, holds stakes in both Lin
and Chancellor and will have an 18 percent ownership in Chancellor
if the acquisition of Lin is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition comes on the heels of an announcement last month
that Chancellor, which is based in Irving, Texas, would buy the
outdoor advertising business Martin Media LP. With the addition of
Lin, Chancellor can offer advertisers radio, television and
billboards in individual markets.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Chancellor can now combine Martin Media's outdoor
advertising in Hartford with Lin's two television stations in that
market. Hicks, Muse also owns 55 percent of Capstar Broadcasting
Corp., which also holds radio interests in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Marcus, who became president and chief executive of
Chancellor on June 1, said that the Lin acquisition ``gives us our
first leg in the television business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at our business as a three-legged stool,'' he said.
``Radio, television and outdoor.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, 51, came to Chancellor after a controlling interest in
the company he founded, Marcus Cable, was sold in April to Paul
Allen, co-founder of Microsoft Corp. He remains president and chief
executive of Marcus while he manages Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor will issue 17.7 million shares of stock to acquire
Lin. The exchange ratio is based on a price for Chancellor common
stock of $51 a share, which was the closing price on July 1, for a
total of $902.7 million. Chancellor will also assume $769 million
of Lin debt.
</P>
<P>
   The $902.7 million is less than Hicks, Muse paid last year for
Lin but represents a double-digit profit after including $815
million that the buyout firm recouped from selling a majority stake
in two Lin television stations to NBC, according to Joseph Jaffoni,
a Chancellor spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Chancellor fell $3.0625 Tuesday, closing at $50.75.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   James Marsh, a senior broadcasting and publishing analyst at
Prudential Securities, said investors might be squeamish about the
taking on of television assets, which have generally had slower
growth than either radio or outdoor advertising, and therefore have
been trading at lower multiples.
</P>
<P>
   He added that some might question the deal because of Hicks,
Muse's connection to both the acquirer and the acquiree. ``I think
people are a little concerned when you're merging companies that
you own into a public company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Marsh called Lin a ``jewel'' in the TV broadcasting
industry, with high margins and esteemed management. Lin's
president and chief executive, Gary Chapman, will become president
of Chancellor's television operations and will take a seat on the
company's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``They paid a full price but a fair price,'' Marsh said of the
transaction. Whether the deal benefits investors in the end depends
on whether Chancellor can push up the growth rate for its new
television segment, he said, adding, ``It's a tough call at this
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was scrutinized by Wasserstein Perella &AMP; Company for
fairness, said Jaffoni, the Chancellor spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus said that his company would continue to look for good
television and outdoor advertising acquisitions, but that he
expected radio to remain its focus. After the Lin purchase, about
80 percent of the company's cash flow will still be from radio, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase also includes Lin's preferred stock position in the
Dallas Stars hockey team and the Texas Rangers baseball team.
Whether the company keeps that interest will depend in part on the
sale price paid when a company holding the teams goes public, as is
now being planned, Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter advised Chancellor Media on the
transaction. Greenhill &AMP; Co. advised Lin Television. The
transaction is subject to a vote of Chancellor stockholders. &QL;

JUDGES REJECT SIERRA BLANCA NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL SITE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional trims) 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a stunning setback to proponents of a
low-level radioactive waste disposal site near Sierra Blanca, two
administrative law judges Tuesday recommended against issuing an
operating license for the project in the West Texas desert.
</P>
<P>
   They cited two factors: the uncertain potential for earthquake
damage to the proposed repository and unanswered questions about
the socio-economic impact on Sierra Blanca if it becomes home to a
second dump for imported toxic wastes.
</P>
<P>
   The judges from the State Office of Administrative Hearings said
the license applicant, the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal
Authority, failed to prove that the Sierra Blanca site would not
pose an ``unreasonable risk to the health and safety of the public
or have a long-term detrimental impact on the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision said the disposal authority ``failed to adequately
characterize the fault directly beneath the site'' and failed to
``adequately address potential negative socioeconomic impacts from
the proposed facility.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonbinding recommendation was submitted to the three-member
Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, which by autumn is
expected to accept or reject the judges' ``proposal for decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling resulted from a series of tedious, technical hearings
spanning 10 weeks that pitted the state disposal authority and
nongovernmental backers, including utilities and medical centers
that generate low-level wastes, against a tiny band of Sierra
Blanca protesters who were backed by a few scientists and
anti-nuclear celebrities and even fewer politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the $34 million project site were planning to
accept waste beginning in 2000 for disposal in concrete canisters
that were to be placed in deep trenches designed not to allow
seepage into underground water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But fears that water in the Rio Grande, about 16 miles away,
could be contaminated caused Mexican officials to join vocal Texas
opposition, which centered on fears that Sierra Blanca would become
the ``nation's pay toilet'' because it already disposes of sewage
sludge from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The low-level waste site is needed, state officials said,
because of federal mandates that states find long-term burial plots
for the waste they generate. Texas, however, has plans to accept
waste from Maine and Vermont to help underwrite the expenses. Both
states are in the process of decommissioning nuclear plants and are
seeking final resting places for some large components.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Alvarado, the Texas disposal authority's chief engineer,
said officials were huddling to map their strategy in the wake of
the judges' recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very surprised and disappointed,'' Alvarado said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that throughout the hearing we met our burden of
proof, that we demonstrated that there was a need for this facility
and that the location proposed for the facility near Sierra Blanca
was technically suitable. We still believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said the TNRCC staff issued an environmental assessment that
concluded the license should be granted. That, he said, and the
fact that ``we don't feel that we are alone in this view'' could
cause the disposal authority to ask the commission to override the
judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to sit down and go through this and re-double our
efforts to satisfy whatever these concerns are and try to move
forward with this again,'' Alvarado said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elated Sierra Blanca resident Bill Addington, a leader among
Hudspeth County residents who oppose the license, likewise
registered surprise at the recommendation. He had already drafted a
press release based on a finding in favor of a license.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't believe it,'' Addington said. But, he added,
``it's still not over. I still believe that politics has a major
role in this _ politics has been kicking this around for 14
years.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that the commission, made up of appointees of Gov.
George W. Bush, ``could still say `yes,' and they probably will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is supposed to be about science and about protecting
human health and safety. I just hope the governor will keep his
promise and listen to the administrative law judges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reiterated his vow not to go through with the project if it
is deemed unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am troubled that two administrative law judges, who spent a
great deal of time reviewing the facts and listening to the
arguments in this case, do not feel the applicants have proven the
safety of the Sierra Blanca site,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said all along that if the site is not proven safe, I
will not support it. I urge the TNRCC to thoroughly review this
recommendation and the facts and to make their decision based on
sound science and the health and safety of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Generators of low-level radioactive wastes were meeting late
Tuesday to map their next move. Eddie Selig, director of Advocates
for Responsible Disposal in Texas, a group including utilities,
universities and medical centers, said ``we were disappointed and
surprised by the judge's decision. The TNRCC itself, the staff,
concluded that the issuance of a license for this proposed project
will not pose an unacceptable risk to public health.''
</P>
<P>
   A test trench has been dug at the proposed site, about five
miles east of Sierra Blanca and a few hundred yards from Interstate
10. But no other major construction has taken place, pending the
outcome of the licensing process.
</P>
<P>
   The administrative law judges noted that, ``no preferable
alternatives to the proposed facility have been established.'' But
they said the Sierra Blanca site might be suitable if it accepts
far less radioactive material than planned.

 &HT;    Human Rights Watch study: Police monitors no more than
ineffective 'paper tiger'
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An international human rights organization said
Tuesday that citizen review of police conduct in Atlanta is the
weakest of 14 cities it examined.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch said the citizen panel that monitors the
Atlanta Police Department is a lackadaisical and ineffective
``paper tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   The human rights watchdog released a report Tuesday that also
found problems with the department's internal affairs division,
calling it biased and secretive when investigating complaints of
police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   HRW said it found evidence of unchecked police brutality in all
the cities it surveyed. In virtually every city, at least one
officer was allowed to remain in his department despite numerous
brutality complaints, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The group also said Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard was
vague in her responses to written questions from HRW about the
internal affairs unit and its procedures for receiving police
brutality complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can be said is that the complaint-intake process is
flawed, which discourages even legitimate complaints,'' researcher
Allyson Collins wrote about Atlanta. ``The police department
resists revealing information about the cases it has received and
investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said cities were chosen because they made news with
police brutality reports. Collins based the report on interviews
with people who are part of or come in contact with police
departments in the cities evaluated, which included Chicago, Los
Angeles, New York and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard also responded only to written questions about the
report from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The mayor's office
did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report certainly strikes the wrong chord that we would be
a department that is not concerned about police brutality,''
Harvard said. ``Certainly I would be concerned about any officer
that uses unnecessary and excessive force. The report gives no
credit or credence to the fact that maybe we are a police
department that is not saddled with a great number of brutal police
officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins discounted the department's claim that it has a low rate
of police brutality complaints, noting that the department's Office
of Professional Standards, its internal affairs division, chooses
which complaints merit investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard said she was surprised by that statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely not true that we pick and choose which
complaints to investigate,'' she said. ``We investigate all
complaints that come to OPS. I get a lot of feedback from the
public in various meetings and OPS and the way it handles
complaints, is not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a citizen has a complaint about how an OPS investigation
was handled, that citizen can contact me and I always review those
complaints myself,'' Harvard added.
</P>
<P>
   But the HRW report painted a different picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to police abuse experts in the city, there is a
perception that the internal affairs unit is not interested in
pursuing complaints against police officers, resulting in distrust
of OPS in many affected communities,'' Collins wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And Atlanta's Civilian Review Board of 29 citizens is an
ineffective alternative, she wrote.
</P>

 &HT;    Patent suit could bring ISS down
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A California company has unleashed a potentially
lethal legal salvo at Atlanta-based Internet Security Systems,
charging Tuesday that the key software used by the highflying young
firm is taken from someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The suit by Santa Clara, Calif.-based Network Associates could
threaten the rocket-sled start of ISS, setting up a legal
confrontation as both companies compete for a potentially huge
market in the systems that protect computer networks. The action
filed in federal court for the Northern District of California
alleges that the software called RealSecure from ISS infringes on a
patent for technology that lets managers protect computers from all
manner of computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates is asking the court to assess the amount of
damages done to it and then to award it triple that amount. But if
Network Associates has its way, the court would also forbid ISS
from making or selling RealSecure, and that move would virtually
cut the heart out of ISS _ and its ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ISS rejected the allegation Tuesday, firing back a
countercharge. William Larson, Network Associates' chief executive,
last week told a group of analysts that he would sue ISS in an
effort to slow down its market momentum, according to Tom Noonan,
ISS president and chief executive officer. ``We believe these
tactics are inappropriate. We think the facts will show that this
suit is frivolous and without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   ISS, which last year had revenues of $13 million, sees itself as
a David facing the Goliath of $612 million-a-year Network
Associates. However, ISS believes that its size is less critical
than its sudden spate of successes. ``Competitive people do not
like losing,'' Noonan said.
</P>
<P>
   The news that the suit had been filed came the same day ISS won
a multiyear contract to provide the Army with RealSecure software
to defend 400 of its facilities from computer assault. Noonan
declined to say how much revenue the deal will produce except to
say the sale is significant and extends the ISS relationship with
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army views ISS as a trusted security adviser. This is a
long-term relationship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Network Associates also sells its security software to the
Army, as well as to Microsoft and various banks, said Art Wong,
Network Associates' director of intrusion protection.
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged off Noonan's charges. ``This is not about the CEO
and what the CEO says. It's about protecting intellectual property.
We own it, and we owe it to our shareholders to protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   ISS got its start with software developed by founder Christopher
Klaus in a Georgia Tech dorm room. The company seemed to have a
headstart into a potentially multibillion-dollar market, since
virtually every organization that uses computers worries about
security.
</P>
<P>
   While Network Associates is much larger, it has only recently
entered the same markets targeted by ISS. Moreover, much-smaller
ISS has gobbled nearly one-third of the growing market, according
to a report released this week by the Yankee Group. That report
gives ISS 30 percent of the market, followed by Axent Technologies
with 19 percent. Network Associates and Cisco Systems follow with
11 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee Group predicts the security market will grow from $45
million last year to $747 million in 2003 _ a compounded annual
growth rate of 49 percent. Should ISS maintain its current market
share in such a market, its revenues would be $224 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Network Associates alleges that ISS has taken a ``method and
system for detecting intrusion into and misuse of a data processing
system,'' Wong said. It said the patent had been owned by Haystack
Labs of Austin, Texas, which was bought by Maryland-based Trusted
Information Systems, which was purchased by Network Associates in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Scrutiny of the newly acquired company revealed the
infringement, Wong said. ``We just want to make sure that we
protect what is ours.''
</P>
<P>
   ISS asserts that the suit is more about market maneuvering than
technology or legality. Network Associates is simply anxious to
take the steam out of ISS, he said. Noonan accuses Network
Associates of having ``cobbled'' together smaller companies that
can offer network security. He declined to say whether ISS had been
approached as a potential acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   But Noonan denied any infringement. ISS has worked with
Haystack, he said. ``We are very familiar with the patent. But we
invented that type of technology and we clearly don't infringe the
patent.''
</P>
<P>
   ISS landed in the spotlight with its first public offering of
stock. On the first day of trading in March, ISS raised $66 million
and its stock price nearly doubled. On Tuesday, company stock rose
62 1/2 cents to close at $44.12 1/2 in slightly heavier than normal
trading. Shares of Network Associates were also up 62 1/2 cents to
$48.75 a share, just $3 shy of its 52-week high.

FACE TO FACE WITH AN UNDERWATER PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 12.)  
 (JT)  
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happens at night in the summertime when the moon is full and
the tides are just right. The coral reefs of Palau, some of the
world's richest, go into a spasm of reproductive surrender, sowing
warm currents with trillions of eggs and sperm that swirl and dance
and ultimately merge to form new life. The orgy is so wild that in
some places, eggs rise through the sea like snowflakes, blizzards
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Even sea cucumbers get into the mood. Ugly by human standards,
these creatures are normally slow and sedentary, looking like fat
worms and seemingly incapable of lust. But in the moonlight they
suddenly rise up and dance in hypnotic rhythms, swaying back and
forth to seed a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the remarkable sights of ``Palau: Paradise of
the Pacific,'' to be shown on Wednesday at 9:00 p.m. on the PBS
series ``The Living Edens.''
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong documentary ranks Palau high among the contemporary
Edens. But romantic cliches are no match for actually seeing the
archipelago's beauty, through the eyes of this documentary. Palau's
200 isles of the equatorial Pacific, heavily forested and lightly
populated, are surrounded by endless miles of coral reefs that teem
with exotic forms of life. It is one of the world's richest
assemblages of species.
</P>
<P>
   The show is the handiwork of Al Giddings, a legend of undersea
photography who helped film underwater scenes for the megahit
``Titanic'' and has made many oceanic dramas and documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   People often see fish as healthy meals. But Giddings' portrait
of undersea Palau puts intriguing new faces on a riot of sea
creatures, revealing complex lives of surprising depth and
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a female titan triggerfish as she tends her eggs. A
male triggerfish, fearing that her hatchlings will compete with his
own, lures her from her nest with a mock attack. She returns too
late. Her eggs have been pillaged by an army of small predators,
and she darts away, clearly upset.
</P>
<P>
   Or, on a lighter note, consider the unusual goings-on near a
large outcrop of coral. Here the war between predator and prey is
suspended by a truce of mutual benefit as small fish called wrasses
remove the parasites that annoy larger fish. Signaling their
readiness by assuming a relaxed pose, bigger fish allow the
cleaners to enter gills and mouths to eat away parasites and
fungus.
</P>
<P>
   At these cleaning stations, even sharks open their fearsome jaws
wide with no menace. ``In this special zone,'' the narrator, James
Coburn, remarks, ``the lords of the reef come out not to hunt small
creatures but to seek their help.''
</P>
<P>
   Painlessly, as befits a tropic dream, yet with thoroughness and
preciseness, the show explores the scientific basis of the
archipelago's abundant life. Overall, the narrative carefully
disentangles the elements and rhythms that make up Palau's biologic
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The coral of Palau comes in a bewildering variety of shapes and
sizes and, we learn, represents more than 300 species, a staggering
number by world standards. These colonies of tiny animals feed on
the microscopic drifters of the sea that continuously float by.
</P>
<P>
   Fields of tiny eels rise from seabed burrows to eat the rain of
plankton, as do giant, 15-foot-wide manta rays, their wings flying
them gracefully, their mouths wide and cavernous.
</P>
<P>
   The tropic sun is the power behind this feast, fueling both the
flotillas of tiny drifting plants and the microscopic algae that
dwell inside each coral polyp. The algae live on coral wastes and
in turn produce food, abetting meals that the corals grab from the
sea with tiny tentacles of bold coloration.
</P>
<P>
   Palau's reefs are underwater cities, providing food and shelter
for crabs and shrimps and giant clams and fish and all kinds of
gooey invertebrates. The reefs are also nurseries. We see a female
cuttlefish, a deadly predator related to the octopus, deposit her
eggs for safekeeping. More than a month later, tiny hatchlings
wiggle out of egg cases, revealing themselves to be perfect
miniatures of their parents and knowing instinctively that the
recesses of the reef offer safety.
</P>
<P>
   At night, strange animals wary of sunlight emerge to join the
reef's pandemonium. A five-foot-long sea cucumber feeds itself,
using feathery tentacles. A nudibranch, a snail without a shell,
flies through the water. It seems to be dressed in a ruffled skirt
and is known as the Spanish Dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Most striking of the nighttime denizens is the lion fish.
Clothed in an outrageous costume of feathery fins and poisonous
barbs, it moves slowly to stalk its prey. With lightning speed that
the filmmakers slow down and show from several angles, the lion
fish snaps up its meal and then moves stealthily forward looking
for another.
</P>
<P>
   The islands of Palau are unusual not only for their opulent
corals but also for more than 70 saltwater lakes, which are fed by
the nearby sea through an underground maze of tunnels and cracks.
Tangles of mangrove roots cover the banks and harbor saltwater
crocodiles. One remote lake is home to more than a million
jellyfish that migrate endlessly as a giant herd. Over time they
have lost their stingers and now, instead of killing, live in
symbiosis with algae. At night the jellies descend to fertilize
their captive algae with the rich nutrients of bottom waters and
during the day rise to absorb the sun's rays. Such jellyfish are
not known to exist anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   With unromantic clarity, the show reveals how these gelatinous
peacemongers can be ruthlessly attacked by predator fish and sea
anemones, who wrap them in pedallike tentacles and feed with
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   The show also teaches us something of Palau's people, who live
on the reef's bounty and know the sea's rhythms intimately. A boy
gathers up a sea cucumber and squeezes out its gooey discharge to
form makeshift shoes. The sticky threads, normally used to entangle
enemies, here protect the boy's feet from sharp coral. Such
cucumbers, the show notes, are returned to the sea, stressed but
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Palau, as in few other places,'' the narrator says, ``human
life is not dominant over nature, but still part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the filmmakers have erred, it is here, seeing people through
a romantic lens that ignores the troubles in paradise, which are
startling in their range and seriousness. Like people elsewhere in
the Pacific, native Palauans set off dynamite charges to fish en
masse, blasting holes 10 or 15 feet wide in coral reefs. Meanwhile,
tourists and scuba divers, often in luxury dive boats, are
descending on reef areas that are still pristine.
</P>
<P>
   And commercial boats scoop up fish for the live trade centering
on restaurants and aquariums, a booming global business fueled by
staggering sums of money. Rumors suggested they were doing so
illegally with cyanide, which stuns the fish into submission and
kills coral reefs. This poison, the same stuff used to execute
human prisoners, has already cut a wide swath of destruction
through Pacific coral.
</P>
<P>
   The human excesses around Palau are shown by Carl Safina in his
1997 book ``Song for the Blue Ocean,'' which devotes three chapters
to the lush isles. Safina, a scientist with the National Audubon
Society, recounts visits there to experts fighting to conserve the
archipelago's wonders.

 Apple Ripe For N.Y. Macworld   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
New York 
 
Is Apple ready for a revival in the Big Apple?
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the personal computer-maker prepares for its first Macworld
Expo trade show here this week, many contend the worm has already
turned.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by cost-dicing measures and a hike in PC shipments, Apple
has reported back-to-back profitable quarters this year, and
sources said interim chief executive Steve Jobs will announce a
third straight profit _ about $50 million _ in a keynote speech
today. Jobs is making the presentation via satellite from
Cupertino, &UR;  &LR; where he has a previous commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, a consummate showman, might pull Mickey Mouse out of his
hat for the event: Reportedly, Apple is close to inking a deal with
Walt Disney Co. to install thousands of Apple's new iMac computers
in Disney hotel rooms, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial news gets better: Orders of the iMac home computer
are booming more than a month before they hit retailers' shelves,
and market researchers predict the company could ship as many as
400,000 machines by the end of September. That should be good
enough for Apple to squeeze out yet another quarter in the black,
industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All indications are the company will turn its first annual
profit since (fiscal year) 1995,'' said analyst James Staten of
Dataquest Inc. in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a company that lost almost $2 billion the previous
two years and has seen its Lilliputian market share scare away
software developers in droves. A year ago this week, former Apple
CEO Gil Amelio was jettisoned, and Jobs was ushered in as de facto
leader. Jobs was later named interim chief in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese have a wonderful phrase: You sweep the stairs
from the top down,'' said Phil Schiller, Apple vice president of
worldwide product marketing at Apple. ``We first had to make
changes at the top before we worked on new products and made Apple
a viable business.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl England, publisher of MacAddict, a monthly magazine in
Brisbane, said: ``Amelio was billed as the adult supervisor, but
there was utter chaos and he exacerbated the problem. What's
amazing is that Steve Jobs, who has the public image of a brat, has
been able to bring a calming, practical influence to Apple.''
</P>
<P>
   The Machiavellian Jobs _ who was ousted from Apple in a power
play more than a decade before he orchestrated the overthrow of
Amelio _ has adopted an addition-by-subtraction management style.
Jobs has spiked more than a dozen computer models from the
company's product line; performed surgery on operating costs with
staff cutbacks at the Claris and Newton divisions; introduced the
sleek new iMac PC; and effectively killed off the Rhapsody
operating system and melded it into the new Mac OS X.
</P>
<P>
   ``The levels of bureaucracy have been stripped away,'' England
said. ``He has made the best of a bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple executives also credit Chief Financial Officer Fred
Anderson, sole high-ranking holdover from the Amelio era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred has the knack for working with Steve's powerful
personality,'' said Jerry York, former chief financial officer of
IBM Corp. and Chrysler Corp. and a current Apple board member. ``He
(Fred) has the ability to bring matters to Steve's attention
without attracting fireworks.''
</P>
<P>
   The austerity program and a new management team stacked with
Jobs' cronies have done wonders for Apple's stock. Shares, which
bottomed out at $12.94 in December, closed at $30.50 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve has done a bang-up job,'' Adobe Systems CEO John Warnock
said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Yet others think the changes are superficial and don't go far
enough to sustain Apple beyond the next 12 months. Despite rumors
of an Internet set-top box, handheld computers and a Disney
partnership, &UR;  &LR; Apple has done little to establish itself in markets
other than education and desktop publishing. The computer-maker is
catering to the latter crowd this week by situating Macworld in New
York, the heart of the publishing world, instead of its regular
Boston haunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a comeback. It's more of a Band Aid strategy designed
to stem the bleeding,'' said analyst Tom Rhinelander, of Forrester
Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``Basically, they've been reining in
the core of their business without improving revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Vadim Zlotnikov, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co. in New
York, said Apple has ``demonstrated a spectacular ability to reduce
costs and build profit margins, but must prove they have the
ability to achieve significant revenue growth.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, sales for Apple's second quarter ended March 27
were down 12 percent from the year-ago quarter, to $1.4 billion
from $1.6 billion. Even though the company has sold more than
500,000 of its speedy Power Mac G3 computers since they were
introduced in the fall, its overall market share has stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's 4.1 percent take of the domestic PC market hasn't budged
from a year ago, according to Dataquest. If anything, the numbers
are down because they don't include Macintosh clone sales, which
accounted for 1.8 percent of the U.S. market last year. Last
summer, Jobs scotched clone agreements with PC-makers because he
feared they were siphoning sales away from Apple.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of (Apple) is 100 times better than a year ago, but
everything is relative,'' Forrester's Rhinelander said. ``Last
year, everyone thought a great icon was dead. Now, they have some
inkling what they want to do and people are willing to give them a
shot. But Apple better do something dramatic _ fast.''

 KKR Rings Up Profits as It Slowly Takes Safeway Off Its Shelves   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
It has taken more than 12 years, but buyout specialist Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. is slowly but surely cashing out what remains
of its stake in Safeway.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the investment firm's latest unloading of shares is yet
another example of savvy investors taking money off the table
before the game breaks up.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Safeway filed documents with the Securities and
Exchange Commission indicating that the grocery giant plans to sell
about 25 million shares owned by KKR and affiliates. After the
proposed secondary offering is completed, KKR and friends will be
left holding only 17 percent of the nation's second-largest food
and drug chain. (That's down from 22 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   That still may seem like a lot, but it's nothing compared with
the whole enchilada that it owned after its leveraged buyout of the
Pleasanton company back in 1986. The investment group, led by Henry
Kravis and George Roberts, has demonstrated eminent patience with
their Safeway turnaround, which included taking the company public
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   And as they say in supermarket parlance, KKR &AMP; friends have made
out well at the register. They paid about 50 cents a share for
Safeway and have been selling those shares for anywhere from $43 to
$58 over the past year or so, according to Bloomberg LP of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad trade, to say the least. KKR should be credited with
``making a great investment,''says high-yield bond analyst Robert
Lupo of BancAmerica Robertson Stephens in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Lupo says the timing of the secondary offering isn't surprising
because KKR has to cash out sometime. And the stock has been
trading near its 52-week high of $42.94 reached on June 30. (The
price is adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 split earlier this year.)
But what does KKR's bailing mean for current and future holders?
</P>
<P>
   Investors weren't thrilled with the news of a secondary
offering. Safeway closed yesterday at $41.56, down $1.31. And while
the offering shouldn't dilute the value of existing Safeway shares,
at least one sell-side analyst has a ``hold'' rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Charles Cerankosky of McDonald &AMP; Co. in Cleveland is
still a fan of the company and of chief executive Steven Burd, to
whom he attributes much of the company's success. However,
Cerankosky says Safeway is ``fairly valued'' and not exactly a
bargain. Under Burd's leadership, Safeway grew its operating profit
margins from 3.29 percent in 1994 to 5.69 percent in 1997. And
Cerankosky contends that there is more margin growth to come,
mostly from continued assimilation of the Vons merger that was
completed in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, which has been deemed a success by most industry
observers, now has some analysts anxiously awaiting the next deal.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway is ``out there looking for another nice acquisition. I
would say they would love to do something in the East'' where the
company has a presence in the Baltimore-Washington, D.C., corridor,
Cerankosky says. Safeway officials did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you're not willing to pay a premium for the prospect
of another merger, then you might do so on the basis of Safeway's
second-quarter earnings due out tomorrow, says analyst Mark Husson
of Merrill Lynch in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Husson expects Safeway earnings to be up 33 percent to 36 cents
a share (not accounting for a labor strike in the comparable
period).
</P>
<P>
   Husson isn't alone. The Street as a whole is bullish on Safeway
(88 percent of the analysts rate the stock a ``buy'') despite the
fact that KKR, its largest shareholders, are at the checkout
counter.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as little surprise then that more than 10 Wall
Street firms _ many of whose sell-side analysts cover the company _
have lined up to manage Safeway's secondary offering.

THIRD OF BABIES AREN'T REGISTERED, UNICEF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Perhaps one-third of all babies do not have
their births registered, leaving them in an official limbo that can
mean missed educational opportunities and health care, UNICEF says
in a new report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without proof of birth, a child cannot be legally vaccinated
in at least 20 countries,'' said the report, to be published
Wednesday by UNICEF, the U.N. children's fund. ``More than 30
countries require birth registration before a child can be treated
in a health center. Most countries demand to see a birth
certificate before enrolling a child in school.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``The Progress of Nations 1998,'' calls the birth
certificate a crucial piece of paper, ``proof of what might be
called the `first right,' the right to an official identity.''
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said in an interview
Monday that the organization began to focus on birth registration
because of a series of experiences. UNICEF officials saw Rwandan
refugee children being thrown into adult camps with men who had
carried out genocidal attacks, but UNICEF found it hard to separate
them because they had no proof of ages.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, immunization campaigns often uncovered
previously uncounted children, she said. And work with street
children revealed the difficulties inherent in finding them schools
if they did not have birth certificates. The missing information
locally led to the worldwide survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a third of the children who are born every year are in
essence nonexistent in the eyes of states, then it puts them at
risk,'' Ms. Bellamy said. ``Not having a birth certificate is the
functional equivalent of not having been born.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of certificates allows children to be more easily
exploited as child labor or sex workers, she added.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF found that registration was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa
and some Asian nations, notably India and Myanmar, where a half to
a third of births were registered, and Cambodia, which had no
registration system at all. Vietnam did not have enough data to
make even an educated guess.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty alone does not determine the level of registration, the
report found, citing high registration rates in most of Latin
America, central Asia and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bellamy acknowledged that many figures in the study, which
point to 40 million unregistered births a year, were based on
estimates. ``These are guesstimates, but these are the best
guesstimates we have,'' she said. ``It is always interesting to me
when we say we had a national immunization day and we had 105
percent coverage. How do you get 105 percent coverage? Because
X-number more children came than the official statistics indicated
existed.'' &QL;

 North Face's Stock Skids 17% On HQ Move   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The stock of North Face Inc. dropped nearly 17 percent yesterday,
one day after the outdoor apparel-maker said it will move its
headquarters to a Colorado site near its chief executive's home.
<TEXT>
<P>
   North Face said Monday that it will spend millions of dollars to
establish a new home base in Carbondale, Colo. About 70 workers
will be relocated from the current San Leandro headquarters, while
some 175 staffers will remain in San Leandro.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things don't look good'' said a Wall Street analyst who
follows the stock. ``Not only are people concerned about the
self-interests at work here, but (North Face is) also splitting up
the company, which raises some risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The move allows North Face President and Chief Executive Officer
James Fifield, an avid skier, to be close to his home near Aspen.
Fifield joined North Face in May.
</P>
<P>
   James Reilly, the company's chief operating officer, said the
decision to move was made after an extensive cost-based analysis of
several locations. The Carbondale move will save significant labor
and other expenses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company decided to leave functions such as retailing, buying
and information systems in San Leandro because people in those jobs
prefer living in the Bay Area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   North Face expects to accrue costs as high as $7 million to
relocate its workers, house them in a temporary headquarters and
expand its sourcing operations in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   That amount does not include a pending purchase of 36 acres of
land in Carbondale and construction of a headquarters there, said
Reilly, who added that the company got good location incentives
from Carbondale.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Colorado move, investors are unhappy about
North Face's acquisition of Italian footwear-maker La Sportiva
S.r.L. announced Monday because that deal will lower earnings in
the near-term, said Shawn Milne, a securities analyst with
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   Milne said he has lowered his 1998 earnings expectations for
North Face to $1.13 per share from $1.21. However, the La Sportiva
deal should help the company in the long-term, he said.
</P>
<P>
   North Face shares yesterday dropped $4 to $20.13.

MARKHASEV FOUND GUILTY IN COSBY MURDER TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A jury took less than six hours on Tuesday to find
19-year-old Mikail Markhasev guilty of murdering Ennis Cosby, the
son of the entertainer Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   Markhasev smiled briefly in the packed courtroom as the verdict
was read, then stood expressionless as Cosby's family members began
to sob and hug. Markhasev was found guilty of both first-degree
murder and attempted robbery under circumstances that could bring
him a sentence of life in prison without parole. Superior Court
Judge David Perez scheduled the sentencing for Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   While prosecutors lauded the verdict, Henry Hall, one of the two
public defenders who represented Markhasev, said he believed the
intense media scrutiny and fame of Cosby's father had contributed
to an unfair judgement by turning attention away from a sober
analysis of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference after the verdict was read, Hall said the
``societal presumption was that there would be a conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Cosby, who was 27 and studying for a Ph.D in
education at Columbia University at the time of his killing on Jan.
16, 1997, was shot once in the head while changing a flat tire late
at night alongside a highway here. Police said it appeared to have
been a crime of opportunity, an unplanned but botched robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the entirely circumstantial nature of the prosecution's
case, which relied on a hair found with the murder weapon, letters
handed over by a convicted forgerer, and a tip to the National
Enquirer, the jury seemed to have dispatched quickly with
Markhasev's defense that a friend of his had actually shot Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   Markhasev's mother had testified that her son had been with her
the night of the murder, and his attorneys had argued that the
incriminating letters, supposedly written by Markhasev to a friend
from jail, had been forged. In one of the letters, Markhasev wrote
that he had killed a black man _ he used an epithet in referring to
Cosby's race _ during a robbery turned bad.
</P>
<P>
   The trial began with several claims that were ultimately
unsubstantiated. Early in the trial the prosecution made the
sensational claim that Markhasev was a member of a notorious prison
gang, and Markhasev's attorneys said they would prove that Eli
Zakaria, a friend of Markhasev, had committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   None of the those assertions were proved. Ultimately, the case
boiled down to the accidental and ultimately tragic crossing of the
paths of the two young men, one who slid into a life of crime after
immigrating here from the Ukraine, and the other working to build a
career as an educator out of the shadow of his wealthy and famous
father.

 &HT;    Profit Recovery making acquisition
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Profit Recovery Group International said Tuesday it
agreed to buy California-based Loder, Drew &AMP; Associates for $70
million cash and 803,535 shares of unregistered, restricted stock.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's closing price of $32.62 1/2, the stock portion of
the deal would be valued at $26 million. The stock can only be sold
after a specified time.
</P>
<P>
   Loder, Drew ``broadens the universe of clients that we can
provide service to outside of our core businesses of retail,
wholesale and government,'' said Donald E. Ellis Jr., chief
financial officer for Profit Recovery, a Cobb County-based audit
recovery and accounts payable firm. Its clients include retail
giant Wal-Mart Stores. Loder, Drew reported 1997 revenues of $22
million.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is expected to close at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Credit line issued
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Loder, Drew could receive as much as $70
million more, depending on future performance.
</P>
<P>
   Profit Recovery said it received a commitment from NationsBank
NA for $125 million in revolving credit, some of which will be used
in the Loder, Drew deal.
</P>
<P>
   This is the largest acquisition for Profit Recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Loder, Drew, which is based in San Juan Capistrano, Calif., has
a heavy concentration in high-technology, industrial, entertainment
and financial services. Its clients include Walt Disney and Texas
Instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald K. Loder, president and chief executive officer, and H.
Richard Byrne, chief operating officer, will remain in their
current roles. At closing, Loder will join the board of Profit
Recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted favorably to the deal. Earlier in the day,
Profit Recovery's stock reached a 52-week high of $32.75. The stock
closed at $32.62 1/2, up $4.31 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profit Recovery has proven itself pretty adept at identifying,
making and integrating acquisitions,'' said Alexander Paris Jr. of
Barrington Research of Chicago. ``With this acquisition, they
become the undisputed largest player in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Paris said the benefits of the acquisition should be reflected
in the third- and fourth-quarter earnings, adding a cent to each.
</P>
<P>
   Profit Recovery has more than 1,300 employees in 18 nations.
Loder, Drew has 208 employees with offices in the United States,
Canada, England and Switzerland.

 &HT;    Two more metro stocks take tumble
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner and Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two more Atlanta firms that have been Wall Street
favorites stumbled Tuesday on disappointing earnings news.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Atlanta-based Harbinger, which makes software for
electronic commerce, fell 29 percent after it said second-quarter
earnings and revenue will miss forecasts because it failed to ship
$1 million of software by the end of the quarter. Harbinger told
investors to expect second-quarter earnings of 10 cents a share,
below analysts' 12 cents-a-share estimate. Revenue will be about
$35 million, 5 percent below analysts' estimates, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   First Albany analyst Ullas Naik told Bloomberg News he's
reviewing his ``buy'' rating on the stock. ``It should take them
two to three quarters to clean it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the stock of Radiant Systems, an Alpharetta firm that
makes computer systems and software used by restaurants,
convenience stores and movie theater chains, plunged 50 percent
after the company told investors to expect a second-quarter loss of
8 to 10 cents a share. The company blamed the shortfall on higher
operating costs, delays in orders and investments in new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier in the year our revenues were impacted by (the
consolidation of some customers), and that has continued,'' said
John Heyman, Radiant Systems' chief financial officer. Heyman
declined to comment on the stock drop or the company's outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's double wallop follows a string of sharp stock price
drops for several metro Atlanta companies once considered Wall
Street favorites. Shares of health care firms Medirisk and
Theragenics fell last week, 69 percent and 36 percent,
respectively. Medirisk reported its second-quarter results would
fall short of analysts' expectations. Analysts' concern over
competition for Theragenics' cancer treatment device sent its stock
down.
</P>
<P>
   Since late May, eight Georgia companies have warned of a
shortfall in quarterly results. And that has devastated their
stocks, which have lost a combined $3.01 billion in value since
their highs earlier this year, when investors were more
enthusiastic about the companies' earnings prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest loser was telecommunications provider Premiere
Technologies, which had a market value of $1.62 billion on March
25. It's now worth $345.6 million. In the case of Radiant Systems,
analysts remain optimistic because much of the problems are outside
the company's control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of changes occurring that are interrupting the
flow of orders from those customers,'' said Cato Carpenter, a BT
Alex Brown analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're normal changes. But they seem to have bunched up in an
abnormal number in the first half of the year, which has thrown off
the whole year for Radiant. They haven't lost any business,
customers or contracts. No competitors are gaining on them. So I
think they will do better in the future. It's a matter of them
getting through the next six months.''

AGENTS OFFER NEW FORUM FOR COMPLAINTS ABOUT AIRLINES

<P>
   Passengers with gripes about airlines have a new way to
complain, courtesy of the American Society of Travel Agents, which
has issued an Air Traveler's Bill of Rights and is inviting
feedback on flights at a new Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The society plans to publish the results of the Web surveys
periodically.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ``rights'' decreed by the society are the right to
truth in advertised prices, schedules and seat availability; equal
access to unbiased, comparative travel information and all fare and
service options; a comfortable seat, reasonable space for carry-on
luggage, healthful meals and clean lavatories; use of all, part or
none of the segments of a lawfully purchased ticket, and timely,
complete and truthful information regarding delays, cancellations
and equipment changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to hear this rising chorus of unhappiness among
the traveling public about one of the main products our members
sell,'' said Paul Ruden, senior vice president for legal and
industry affairs of the travel agents' group. ``We decided to set
out a set of principles that would address this in the English
language in the hope that the airlines would embrace it.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't happened yet. The Air Transport Association, the
major airlines' trade group, sees the action as a display of
agents' continued anger over carriers' decisions to cut travel
agents' commissions last year. ``Its motivation has nothing to do
with consumers,'' said David Fuscus, a spokesman for the airlines'
association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Planes are fuller than they've ever been, but the system's
handling it well,'' he said, citing a survey in May that showed an
approval rate of 70 percent for the airlines, with 11 percent of
consumers disapproving and the rest having no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Will travel agents be issuing a cruise passenger's bill of
rights or a hotel guest's bill of rights in the future? ``We will
look at that,'' Ruden said. ``We wanted to deal first with the most
obvious problem, and from the standpoint of the business of the
industry, this is the largest segment.'' Travelers can weigh in
with a confidential survey rating their flights at the new Web site
(www.astanet.com/travelersrights).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of complaints about the airlines filed the
old-fashioned way, with the Department of Transportation, jumped in
May: There were 914, almost 30 percent more than in April and 25
percent more than in May 1997, according to the department's Air
Travel Consumer Report for the month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RATES UP, OCCUPANCY DOWN
</P>
<P>
   The average daily room rate at U.S. hotels will rise 5 percent
this year, to $78.94, according to the Price Waterhouse Coopers
Lodging Research Network, even though hotel occupancies are
expected to decline slightly (less than 1 percentage point) for the
second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Occupancies are still very high, and ``hotel operators are
confident the rates will be accepted,'' according to Bjorn Hanson,
a lodging consultant with Price Waterhouse Coopers. Markets such as
New York and San Francisco, where hotel rooms are in great demand,
are also contributing to higher average prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the rate of increase has slowed, from 6.1 percent
in 1997. And increases for 1999 and 2000 are predicted to be
smaller, at 4.6 percent and 4 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   LEAVING THE KEYS
</P>
<P>
   Valet parking has come to Newark International Airport, and
should soon arrive at Kennedy International Airport. At Newark,
passengers can drive to Monorail Station E and drop off their cars
with an attendant, then take the monorail to their terminal. The
introductory rate is $18 a day. The service, operated by Ampco
System Parking of Los Angeles, uses a dedicated 800-space lot to
which only the attendants have access, according to Bill Cahill, a
spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The
authority plans to extend the service to Kennedy ``probably before
the end of July,'' Cahill said.
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   _ Delta Air Lines and UAL's United Airlines will become partners
in each other's frequent-flier programs on Sept. 1. Members of
Delta's Sky Miles program and United's Mileage Plus program will be
able to accrue miles in either account on flights within the United
States and Puerto Rico that are not part of an international
itinerary. The two carriers plan to establish a timetable for
reciprocal redemption of miles shortly.
</P>
<P>
   _ American Trans Air began flying between La Guardia Airport and
Midway Airport in Chicago on Tuesday with introductory
nonrefundable one-way fares starting at $88 for July. Tickets must
be purchased by July 17. &QL;

<P>
   DALLAS _ It took flying halfway around the world, a court
appearance in rural Texas and six long weeks, but Chinese-American
Xiaonan Su Hawke was reunited Tuesday with her only child, whom she
feared she would never see again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very happy. I thought I had lost my son,'' the
38-year-old Beijing resident, a naturalized U.S. citizen, said in
halting English.
</P>
<P>
   On May 21, her American husband left their luxury apartment in
the Chinese capital with their 10-year-old son, Aaron, when their
marriage collapsed amid threats and accusations, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hawke, 45, a longtime Beijing resident fluent in Chinese
and president of a subsidiary of a Chicago-based fertilizer
company, flew to Texas and Arizona, where Aaron participated in
basketball camps and played with cousins.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Xiaonan Su Hawke was granted temporary custody of
her son in 266th District Court in Stephenville, Texas, home of her
husband's brother. But Frank Hawke failed to heed a court order to
appear with the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The father withdrew a petition requesting custody the day
before, and said he thought he was no longer required to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Aaron Hawke arrived on the 42nd-floor offices of a
Dallas law firm with a backpack, an armload of race car toys, an
uncle and a paternal grandfather. But he refused to hug his mother
until a conference room was cleared of TV crews and reporters
called by her attorney's public relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very afraid of the cameras and said, `Give me a bag for
my head,' '' Xiaonan Su Hawke said later. Her son also turned down
an offer to visit Disneyland, telling her, ``I want to go back to
Beijing today.''
</P>
<P>
   She emphasized that whatever the outcome of a divorce action in
China, she would never prevent her son from seeing his father or
having a normal relationship with him.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and son will return to China with a Texas court order
granting her sole custody for 90 days, preventing her husband from
flying on the same plane, and declaring that jurisdiction in the
case rests with the Chinese legal system because all parties are
Beijing residents.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hawke, in the petition filed in 266th District Court, said
he had left China because of his wife's false accusations of
spying, treason and ``heinous capital'' crimes, which were made
``all in the presence and hearing of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   A news release issued by his wife's law firm quotes her as
saying that the marriage broke down after he had an extramarital
affair. Her attorney quoted a statement from Hawke saying the
relationship with the other woman was ``public and above board.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was quite upset at the press release _ that his mom
would do that _ try to embarrass him through embarrassing his
father,'' Frank Hawke said Tuesday. ``So I've been very leery of
getting involved in a public spat with my wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a very private person, and everything I've done since
this whole thing started was, in my mind, done in the best
interests of my son,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``That's
been the spirit of my actions. The reason for my silence was to
protect him. I don't believe this belongs in a public forum. This
is a sensitive family matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In his court filing, Frank Hawke said the influence of his
wife's family in Beijing would prevent him from getting a fair
hearing in a Chinese court. Her father is a retired Red Army
general who accompanied Communist leader Mao Tse-tung on the
1933-34 Long March.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her family's clout, Xiaonan Su Hawke said that in
China, ``everybody is equal.''

CHANCELLOR MEDIA, LIN TELEVISION PLAN HICKS MULTIMEDIA MERGER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The shape and direction of Tom Hicks' media empire became
clearer Tuesday, after the Dallas investor agreed to combine Lin
Television with Chancellor Media Corp. in a stock-and-debt
transaction valued at $1.64 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team and the Dallas
Stars hockey club, is chairman of both Lin Television and
Chancellor Media. His Dallas investment firm, Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP;
Furst, founded Chancellor four years ago by acquiring a string of
radio stations in major markets.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives Irving-based Chancellor, the nation's
second-largest radio company, a foothold in television, and it
moves Hicks closer to his vision of a media conglomerate that can
leverage its size, efficiency and reach.
</P>
<P>
   With holdings in TV, radio and billboards, Chancellor expects to
heavily cross-promote its properties and entice advertisers with
one-stop shopping that gives them an easy way to establish their
brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Hicks is a great visionary, and this is a vision we've
been talking about for a long time,'' said Jeffrey Marcus, chief
executive for Chancellor Media and an investor with Hicks. ``It's a
great opportunity to sell across many mediums. And in this
business, you sell impressions, and the more you make, the better
off you are.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Marcus said, an advertiser could tout a movie on
billboards and in broadcast ads, and then put the film's stars on
local radio and TV programs _ all properties controlled by Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a year ago, Hicks, Muse announced plans to buy Lin, and
closed on that $2 billion deal in March. In North Texas, Lin owned
KXAS/Channel 5, but Hicks has since dealt 80 percent of that
station to NBC.
</P>
<P>
   If the Chancellor-Lin stock swap is approved by regulators, the
Hicks, Muse stake would double to about 18 percent of Chancellor
Media.
</P>
<P>
   Because Hicks is directly involved in both Chancellor and Lin,
Marcus said, Chancellor Media appointed a special committee to
review the transaction. He said Hicks did not participate in the
board discussion Monday, when the deal was approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very much an arms-length transaction,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee approved the deal after an investment firm,
Wasserstein Perella &AMP; Co., reported that the swap was fair to
Chancellor shareholders. A separate firm, Greenhill &AMP; Co., advised
Lin shareholders, who are primarily Hicks, Muse investors.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, expected to close this year, calls for Lin
shareholders to get 0.03 share of Chancellor for each share of Lin
stock, and for Chancellor to assume $769 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor will issue 17.7 million shares of stock, and the
company said the acquisition would boost after-tax cash flow by 6
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The total value of the deal is $1.64 billion, Marcus said,
representing 12.7 times Lin's projected cash flow for 1999.
Although the total sales figure is lower than what Hicks, Muse paid
for Lin, most of KXAS/Channel 5 and the NBC affiliate in San Diego
have been dealt to NBC.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Chancellor-Lin deal closes, Marcus said, the
value of the Lin property would have increased 13.6 percent since
Hicks, Muse first committed to buying it.
</P>
<P>
   Lin's holdings include 12 TV stations _ eight are network
affiliates, and four are independents that have local marketing
alliances with affiliates. Among the markets served are
Indianapolis; New Haven, Conn.; Buffalo, N.Y.; and Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Lin's operating assets account for almost $1.5 billion of the
sale price. Additional assets include a 20 percent stake in
KXAS/Channel 5, valued at $75 million, and a limited stake in
Southwest Sports, valued at about $50 million, Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Sports includes the sports enterprises that Hicks has
acquired independently, separate from his investment firm. That
includes KXTX/Channel 39, the Rangers, the Stars and some real
estate around The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, if Hicks succeeds in taking the sports venture
public, Marcus said, Chancellor would either cash out its stake or
continue as a major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Radio will continue to be the dominant element in Hicks' media
play, accounting for roughly 80 percent of a projected $1.8 billion
in 1999 revenue for Chancellor, Marcus said. Hicks, Muse also owns
55 percent of Capstar Broadcasting, an Austin-based company that
has more than 300 stations in smaller markets.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, who joined Chancellor in April after agreeing to sell
most of Marcus Cable to software billionaire Paul Allen, repeated
Tuesday that Capstar will make a good fit under the Chancellor
umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically, it makes sense, but we have to make the numbers
work,'' Marcus said, adding that the deal will require special
review committees and protracted negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But observers expect it to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of if, it's a question of when,'' said
Paul Leonard, managing director of Star Media Group, a Dallas
investment firm that specializes in radio deals.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said the combinations make sense for the Hicks team,
because they offer the chance to make synergies work. For all the
talk about combining operations, many companies fail to commit
fully to the concept so they don't reap the benefits, Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor could be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need common ownership to make it work,'' Leonard said.
``When you're just sister companies, trying to work together, it
can be a lot of talk. But when you're under one umbrella _ formally
_ it can really bear fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street may be more skeptical. Chancellor's stock, traded as
AMFM, fell $3.0625 Tuesday, closing at $50.75.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The General Assembly voted overwhelmingly
Tuesday to give the Palestinians a larger role in the United
Nations and a voice in many of its peripheral activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, already members of several groups of
developing nations, hailed the vote as a first step toward full
U.N. membership.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution cites elections in Palestinian territories in
January 1996 and the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, a
self-governing entity in the West Bank and Gaza, as evidence that
Palestinians are now responsible for administering territory on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's representative, Dore Gold, denounced this link as a
``transparent effort'' to influence talks about the final status of
disputed territories. His comments reflect growing fears in Israel
that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is likely to declare a
Palestinian state next year, raising the possibility of new
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   The vote _ 124-4, with 10 abstentions and 26 countries not
present _ overcame the strong opposition of the United States.
There are no vetoes in the Assembly and the majority vote carries.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution in effect creates a new ``super-observer'' status
for the Palestinians _ or Palestine, as the delegation has been
known officially since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians will now have the right to take part in General
Assembly debate and reply to other speeches; to co-sponsor
resolutions on Middle East issues, and to take part in a range of
U.N. conferences and meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians will not have the right to vote in the General
Assembly, however. And nothing in Tuesday's actions affects the
work of the Security Council, which already allows the Palestinians
to speak in formal sessions when the interests of the Palestinian
people are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the U.S. representative, said before the vote
that the move is ``the wrong resolution at the wrong time.'' He
said it would set a precedent for other observers or non-members.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this resolution passes, it will undermine our efforts to
get the peace process back on track and hurt everyone's interests,
including those it most intended to help,'' Richardson said in a
speech. ``Exchanging momentum toward real progress on the ground
for symbolic progress in this chamber does not strike us as a good
bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department condemned the vote in strong
terms. Spokesman James Rubin said the Clinton administration
considered the vote an unnecessary and untimely mistake that could
lead to unilateral actions on the part of the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that this decision undermines the chances of bringing
peace to the Middle East,'' Rubin said. ``It undermines those very
people who it was presumably designed to help. And it may be a
symbolic victory for some, but it makes it harder to prevent the
two sides from taking unilateral actions that can harm the peace
process. This is a unilateral action that we believe was
unnecessary and untimely.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Congress is at its most critical toward the
United Nations, Tuesday's vote is sure to intensify the antagonism
on Capitol Hill. Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the
House international relations committee, described the vote as ``a
slap in the face'' of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is deplorable that, despite the Palestinians' having failed
to meet many of their commitments under the Oslo accords, they
should be rewarded in such a manner,'' he said in a statement. ``It
recalls for many of us the abhorrent resolution equating Zionism
with racism that this very same General Assembly once adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   After making some progress earlier in this decade in reducing
the isolation of Israel at the United Nations, the United States
has been increasingly sidelined more recently on Middle East
issues, which it tries to keep out of the United Nations as much as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday only Israel, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia voted
with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union countries, Canada and Russia were among those
voting for the resolution, which was first introduced in December,
then deferred for further study.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst Sucharipa, the representative of Austria, which holds the
presidency of the European Union, said that the Europeans had
concluded that the resolution would not set new legal precedents
for the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Europe supported the move, he said, in recognition of the
``practical difficulties'' the Palestinians were having in their
work as observers at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, having finally won this round, intend to press
for full General Assembly membership, their delegation leader,
Nasser Al-Kidwa, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small victory was achieved for Palestine today and we thank
you for that,'' he said in a speech after the vote. ``However, we
do want to say that it is our hope that our reliance on this
resolution passed today will not last for a long time, as we hope
that the United Nations will accept Palestine as a member state in
the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Kidwa said he hoped to see Palestine accepted as a full
member in the next General Assembly session, beginning in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shall be the big victory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's resolution was sponsored by a group of Arab nations,
joined by Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cuba, Malaysia, Vietnam and
several African countries.
</P>
<P>
   American Jewish Committee spokesman Arthur Berger said the
effort by the Arab and Third World nations was a step back for the
United Nations. ``Unfortunately this reminds a lot of people of the
way the U.N. General Assembly used to be when an absolute majority
of members would vote for anything that was anti-Israel,'' he said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, what this does is try to influence the final status
of negotiations while the Palestinians and the Israelis are at a
critical moment. That's not helpful. In fact, it can be quite
unhelpful.''
</P>
<P>
   David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish
Committee, said: ``The U.N. member states might one day regret this
decision because it could establish a precedent that could return
in the form of other disgruntled political movements bypassing the
negotiating framework and establishing facts through U.N.
maneuvering.'' &QL;

   DALLAS _ It took flying halfway around the world, a court
appearance in rural Texas and six long weeks, but Chinese-American
Xiaonan Su Hawke was reunited Tuesday with her only child, whom she
feared she would never see again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very happy. I thought I had lost my son,'' the
38-year-old Beijing resident, a naturalized U.S. citizen, said in
halting English.
</P>
<P>
   On May 21, her American husband left their luxury apartment in
the Chinese capital with their 10-year-old son, Aaron, when their
marriage collapsed amid threats and accusations, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hawke, 45, a longtime Beijing resident fluent in Chinese
and president of a subsidiary of a Chicago-based fertilizer
company, flew to Texas and Arizona, where Aaron participated in
basketball camps and played with cousins.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Xiaonan Su Hawke was granted temporary custody of
her son in 266th District Court in Stephenville, Texas, home of her
husband's brother. But Frank Hawke failed to heed a court order to
appear with the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The father withdrew a petition requesting custody the day
before, and said he thought he was no longer required to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Aaron Hawke arrived on the 42nd-floor offices of a
Dallas law firm with a backpack, an armload of race car toys, an
uncle and a paternal grandfather. But he refused to hug his mother
until a conference room was cleared of TV crews and reporters
called by her attorney's public relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very afraid of the cameras and said, `Give me a bag for
my head,' '' Xiaonan Su Hawke said later. Her son also turned down
an offer to visit Disneyland, telling her, ``I want to go back to
Beijing today.''
</P>
<P>
   She emphasized that whatever the outcome of a divorce action in
China, she would never prevent her son from seeing his father or
having a normal relationship with him.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and son will return to China with a Texas court order
granting her sole custody for 90 days, preventing her husband from
flying on the same plane, and declaring that jurisdiction in the
case rests with the Chinese legal system because all parties are
Beijing residents.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hawke, in the petition filed in 266th District Court, said
he had left China because of his wife's false accusations of
spying, treason and ``heinous capital'' crimes, which were made
``all in the presence and hearing of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   A news release issued by his wife's law firm quotes her as
saying that the marriage broke down after he had an extramarital
affair. Her attorney quoted a statement from Hawke saying the
relationship with the other woman was ``public and above board.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was quite upset at the press release _ that his mom
would do that _ try to embarrass him through embarrassing his
father,'' Frank Hawke said Tuesday. ``So I've been very leery of
getting involved in a public spat with my wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a very private person, and everything I've done since
this whole thing started was, in my mind, done in the best
interests of my son,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``That's
been the spirit of my actions. The reason for my silence was to
protect him. I don't believe this belongs in a public forum. This
is a sensitive family matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In his court filing, Frank Hawke said the influence of his
wife's family in Beijing would prevent him from getting a fair
hearing in a Chinese court. Her father is a retired Red Army
general who accompanied Communist leader Mao Tse-tung on the
1933-34 Long March.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her family's clout, Xiaonan Su Hawke said that in
China, ``everybody is equal.''

 &HT;    Longhorns are No. 1 - at least in media guides
 &HT;    (EDS: Resending due to incomplete transfer)
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It is no cause for an orange Tower, riotous
swarming of the Drag, parades or gaudy trophies.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're a proud University of Texas alum who needs
something in the athletic program to be proud about, there's this
recent development:
</P>
<P>
   In 1997-98, the Longhorns won six national titles, including a
sweep of the three big men's sports _ football, basketball and
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   For media guides.
</P>
<P>
   When bragging, that last part's on a need-to-know basis.
</P>
<P>
   At its recent convention in Spokane, Wash., the College Sports
Information Directors of America also honored the UT guides for
men's swimming and diving and men's track and field as tops in the
nation. The women's basketball guide cover was also chosen No. 1;
the guide itself No. 2 behind Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Of the school's 15 media guides, 11 finished in the top 10
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   It's believed that the Longhorns' sweep of the top three men's
sports was the first ever. Judges, one each from print and
electronic media and one with a graphics background, rate the
guides on content, convenience, organization and appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've become more than a media guide,'' said Mary Elliott,
UT athletic publications director. ``They're also used for
recruiting and marketing. But we still make sure it has everything
the media needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with publications specialists Mary Elliott and Donna
Seago on the guides were sports information staffers John Bianco
(football), Dave Saba (men's basketball), Mike Forcucci (baseball),
Mark Olsen (track), Penny Abrahams (swimming) and Barb Kowal
(women's basketball).
</P>
<P>
   In winning the football honors, the Horns nudged past perennial
media guide titan Notre Dame, which has won top honors seven times
in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's football guide has already been sent to the printer
and will include new sections on year-by-year statistics and a
comprehensive look at All- America halfback Ricky Williams'
records, rankings and stats.

 &HT;    Weiss family get All-Star treatmen
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Everything has been a rush these days for Braves
shortstop Walt Weiss and Tuesday was more rushed than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we got a game tonight?'' Weiss responded, somewhat
sarcastically, when a reporter asked him about his upcoming
All-Star appearance. ``To be honest, I haven't even thought about
it , nothing about it. I just haven't had a chance it's been so
crazy around here. But I think when I get in there it will all hit
me, that I am an All-Star.''
</P>
<P>
   And little Brody was right there to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The spunky 3-year-old who last week at this time was in an
Atlanta hospital bed fighting E. coli, was in section 126 at Coors
Field watching old dad play in the midsummer classic.
</P>
<P>
   At such a young age, Brody probably doesn't have any idea of the
significance of Walt being on the field and his son being in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   But said a proud father, ``I think when all this is over we will
look back at this and really appreciate it as a family. But right
now things are still pretty hectic, I still feel right in the
middle of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Brody was at the game with mother Terri and brother Blake. They
were treated like royalty as this has become a national story, one
that has been written in almost every major-league town. In
Tuesday's Rocky Mountain News, one of two hometown newspapers, the
headline read: ``Weiss still feeling son's illness.'' The city has
welcomed the Weiss' with open arms and well they should with Weiss
having spent four years as a Colorado Rockie. Owner Jerry McMorris
even sent out his private jet to pick the family up in Atlanta and
bring them to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something that I will never forget, that he reached
out to me and my family'' he said. ``Collectively, this city has
been amazing. I can't tell you how nice everyone had been.''
</P>
<P>
   The Weiss' have been staying at their home in a Denver suburb,
something they kept despite Weiss signing with the Braves. And
while Weiss will be heading to Miami tonight where the Braves open
up the second half of the season on Thursday, the family will
remain in Denver as Brody will continue to be checked by their
family doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are out of the woods as far as Brody is
concerned,'' Weiss said. ``There may be some long terms things but
nothing serious.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite all, Weiss has been very patient, answering one
question after another, doing radio and television interviews. He
never said an ugly word, never snapped at anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But for several hours Tuesday night, Weiss' attention shifted
back on the field. When he was introduced to the crowd, he received
a standing ovation. It was the longest of the pregame activities,
even longer than that of fan favorite Cal Ripken Jr. And on the big
screen television, there was Brody sitting on Terri's lap, both
smiling away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what to expect out there,'' he said. ``I
haven't thought about what it would be like. But I have always
wanted to be an All-Star.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, both on and off the field.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Datek Online, one of the nation's fastest-growing
online brokerage firms, has postponed an initial public offering of
stock because of widening investigations into its trading
practices, according to people close to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has won praise in recent years from Wall Street and
federal regulators for its innovative technology, including a
flourishing electronic stock exchange, the Island E.C.N.
</P>
<P>
   But in May, Datek's practices came under question after the
office of Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said it was
investigating whether Datek had participated in a money-laundering
operation.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the Securities and Exchange Commission appears to be
going beyond an initial investigation into off-shore transactions
involving Datek and looking into whether the firm offered customers
guaranteed stock returns, a practice that could run afoul of SEC
antifraud provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is also investigating whether Datek encouraged
illegal trading practices by some of the more than 200 day traders
on its desks in the 1990s, according to people who said they were
interviewed by the SEC two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations could be a big setback for the company, now
the fifth-largest online brokerage firm, with 95,000 customers and
$2 billion in assets under its watch. Datek, whose online unit is
not a target of any investigation, has won high ratings from
publications like Barron's and Smart Money in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly which parts of the once-sprawling company
are being investigated, but the inquiries cover activities as
recent as 1997, when Datek had both trading and online units,
according to those who have been interviewed by law enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Datek, which is based in Iselin, N.J., said in a statement
Tuesday that it ``does not comment on its capital-raising or
financing activities,'' such as a public stock offering, or on
press reports about investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The company has in recent months distanced itself from its old
trading unit, which was spun off in March to Heartland Securities,
a money management firm. Still, in Tuesday's statement, Datek
denied guaranteeing stock returns to its customers or engaging in
illegal trading activity.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, law enforcement officials say that two
investigations into possible stock manipulation and fraudulent
off-shore deals intersected and that Datek's activities were found
at the crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   One of those cases, they said, involved A.R. Baron &AMP; Co., a
brokerage firm, now defunct, whose top executives pled guilty or
were convicted in the last year of defrauding investors in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Although the details are sketchy, officials in one investigation
are looking into whether Datek and at least one person in the A.R.
Baron case were involved in manipulating the stocks of companies
that sold unregistered shares to overseas investors in Regulation S
offerings, which have been the subject of numerous investigations
in recent years by the SEC and Morgenthau.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate investigation, the SEC filed suit three months ago
against Sheldon Maschler, who once headed Datek's trading
operation. The suit contended that he took part in a scheme to
manipulate the shares of Alter Sales Co., an auto company based in
Miami. Datek was not named in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has also been investigating whether Datek manipulated
shares of Fortune Petroleum Co. in conjunction with a Regulation S
stock offering, according to people interviewed by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street stock analysts say that Datek continues to tighten
its controls under the leadership of Jeffrey A. Citron, the
27-year-old chairman and chief executive. Datek, they say, is
hoping that its profitable online operation can survive, and indeed
thrive, unscathed by the investigations, making a public offering
possible at a much later date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an attractive company in an attractive market,'' said
James Marks, an online analyst at CS First Boston, which has held
discussions with Datek about a public offering. ``But these issues
under investigation have to be resolved for a successful IPO.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, SEC investigators met or spoke with several
former traders about trading practices at Datek, and several months
ago traders told officials from the district attorney's office that
for several years Datek's trading operation had orally guaranteed
customers a return of 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, they said, encouraged traders to sign up relatives and
friends to invest large sums of money to bolster trading
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew some shady dealings were going on,'' said Dale A.
Tucker, a trader who recently left the firm to go to graduate
school. ``We didn't understand the accounts up there, but I think a
lot of people didn't care because we were making a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Datek, which was founded in 1970, began as a small brokerage
firm serving customers in Brooklyn. In the mid-1980s, it opened a
Manhattan branch. Citron, who was hired as a clerk just after
graduating from high school, helped transform the small firm, which
had trading profits of $2 million in 1991, to one with profits of
more than $94 million in 1996. The company used computers to
exploit the Nasdaq stock market's small-order execution system, and
its people became known on Wall Street as ``SOES bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Datek moved into online trading, and quickly
established itself as a leader there, winning acclaim for its $9.99
trading fees and its fast executions. When profits in that area
soared, Maschler _ who Datek says is no longer an employee _ led
the push for an initial public offering, according to his
associates.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have been enthusiastic about the company's
prospects and some expected Datek to raise $150 million in an
offering this year. Piper Jaffray was one of the investment houses
prepared to take Datek public, according to analysts, before the
investigations tabled those plans. &QL;

BRAZIL THWARTS NETHERLANDS BID IN SHOOTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSEILLE -- Maybe they should have just gone on until dawn.
There was a full moon in a clear sky and a cool breeze off the
Mediterranean and nobody had anything scheduled until the weekend.
Why did the best match of the World Cup have to come down to
penalty kicks? And why, the Dutch moaned, did they have to be the
ones standing around numbly at the end? Maybe the Almighty really
is a Brazilian.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was God helping me,'' insisted keeper Taffarel after he'd
blocked two shots to thwart the Netherlands 4-2 in a shootout
(after a 1-1) tie and put his mates into Sunday's final for the
second straight time with a chance to win their fifth Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Brazilians had beaten Italy for the Cup in a
shootout when Roberto Baggio's kick sailed over the bar in the Rose
Bowl. Tuesday in the Stade Velodrome, they escaped when Taffarel
knocked aside the last two shots by Phillip Cocu and Ron de Boer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should go in,'' shrugged de Boer, after he'd watched
Taffarel come up exulting and pointing his index fingers to the
heavens. ``It's a very dreadful feeling. We could have won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch had also gone out to the Brazilians last time, 3-2 in
the quarterfinals, after coming from two goals down to tie. But
this time hurt much worse. This time, the Dutch were one step
closer to winning the prize that had eluded their Clockwork Orange
teams in 1974 and 1978. This time, the Dutch had tied the match in
the 87th minute on a Patrick Kluivert header and had twice kept
Ronaldo from beating them in overtime, only to see it come to
nothing. ``After we tied it, I truly believed we'd win,'' said de
Boer.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians, who'll become the first team since 1962 (also
Brazil) to repeat as champions if they beat Wednesday's
France-Croatia victor in the final, dodged a bullet last night and
they knew it. The Dutch had them backed into their half for most of
the game, attacking and attacking and attacking some more. And yet,
because of one moment of brilliance from the 21-year-old Ronaldo,
the Brazilians thought they had it won before overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch had tied them in knots for the first half, closing
down the midfield, tripping up Ronaldo whenever he came near the
ball and nearly scoring themselves on shots by Dennis Bergkamp and
Kluivert that just went over the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Then, half a minute into the second half, Ronaldo had Brazil on
the board. Taking a deft through ball from Rivaldo, he dashed into
the area, as Cocu desperately tried to get a piece of him, and put
the ball past keeper Edwin Van Der Sar for his fourth goal of the
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Dutch had been behind in the
tournament and they came back with a fierce resolve. In the 53rd
minute, here was Kluivert heading a corner down to Wim Jonk, whose
point-blank shot Taffarel barely managed to block. In the 65th,
Kluivert just missed on another header off a corner, covering his
face in dismay.
</P>
<P>
   In came Denilson for Bebeto, and Brazil came back to life.
Rivaldo sent in Ronaldo again, five yards in the clear this time,
but Edgar Davids and Van Der Sar combined to thwart him. Then
Denilson crossed nicely for Rivaldo, who was sitting on the turf
but managed to poke a shot at Van Der Sar.
</P>
<P>
   So it went, with the Brazilians eager to put the Dutch away and
the Dutch, who had won their last two matches with Yugoslavia and
Argentina in the final minute, confident they could find a way to
stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kluivert, the 22-year-old whippet from AC Milan, had
been misfiring, his mates kept looking for him. Finally de Boer,
alone on the right side, sent over a high cross and Kluivert,
skying above three yellow jerseys, knocked it in.
</P>
<P>
   So it came to overtime, with Ronaldo trying to win it by
himself. He nearly did, twice in a minute, on a bicycle kick that
Frank de Boer headed away with Van Der Sar out and a blast that Van
Der Sar knocked away.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo had one last burst in him, two minutes into the second
overtime period, but Frank de Boer managed to get the ball from
behind in the area, narrowly averting a foul that could have
finished the Dutch there.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, for another 30 minutes of this. But referee Ali Mohamed
Bujsaim called for a shootout -- the third of the tournament -- and
now everybody was in the circle, the Brazilians kneeling, the Dutch
standing with their arms around one another.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians, who've now been in shootouts in three of the
last four Cups, calmly slammed home four shots -- first Ronaldo,
then Rivaldo, then Emerson, then Dunga. Frank de Boer and Dennis
Bergkamp cashed theirs for the Dutch, but Taffarel dove left to
deny Cocu. Now came Ron de Boer, stutter-stepping to throw Taffarel
off, then watching in shock as the keeper dove right and knocked
the ball awry.
</P>
<P>
   For a long while, the Dutch stood on the pitch, hands on hips,
reluctant to leave. It had been 20 years since they'd been this
close. ``The dream is over,'' said Ron de Boer. ``It's a pity.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Brazilians, the only non-European team to win the Cup in
Europe (in 1958), the party continues. ``In Brazil, people are
already celebrating,'' said coach Mario Zagallo. ``But will we only
celebrate after the final. We are here only to win -- and we will
win.''

SCIENTISTS SAY PAKISTANI DEFECTOR IS NOT CREDIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOHN KIFNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of scientists who questioned the Pakistani claiming to
be a defector from his country's nuclear weapons program have
concluded that he knows nothing about nuclear physics.
</P>
<P>
   The story told by Iftikhar Khan Chaudhry, who is seeking asylum
in the United States, ``just seems to be made up out of whole
cloth,'' said Frank von Hipple, a professor of public and
international affairs at Princeton University who helped organize
the questioning, which was conducted both in English and in Khan's
native Urdu.
</P>
<P>
   Khan had told a series of news conferences last week that as a
research scientist in Pakistan's nuclear arms program he had been
present at a meeting on April 25 _ weeks before India and Pakistan
drew international alarm with dueling nuclear tests _ at which the
military high command, fearing a strike by India, authorized a
pre-emptive nuclear attack on New Delhi within 48 hours. He said he
was ready to disclose sensitive secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But the story is now being greeted with skepticism. In the
ensuing days, Pakistani officials said he was actually a low-paid
accountant for a bathroom tile manufacturer and experts on the
region expressed considerable skepticism over the details he
provided. His story, however, was front-page news in India,
increasing strain in the already tense subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking to him, in the first few sentences, it was clear his
story was not quite credible,'' Dr. Abdul Nayyar, a professor of
physics at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad and a visiting
research fellow at Princeton, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave either no answers or very wrong answers,'' Nayyar
said, adding in a cricket metaphor common to Pakistan, ``He
completely bowled out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nayyar, who graduated from Karachi University, which Khan also
claimed as his alma mater, said he could not describe courses there
and that when he was asked about his teachers ``he was just
concocting names.'' Indeed, he said, Khan put a physics building in
the wrong place on campus.

   Zia Mian, a Pakistani physicist and research associate at the
Woodrow Wilson school at Princeton who asked questions in Urdu with
Nayyar during a telephone conference call on Monday to the
Manhattan office of Khan's lawyer, Michael Wildes, was also
unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked him what is a reactor and after much hesitation he
said it's where a reaction takes place,'' Mian said. ``We asked him
what a moderator was, and he didn't know. Now anyone who has been
reading a newspaper there the past few months would know that,
there has been so much written. He just had no comprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview with Khan was set up by the Federation of American
Scientists, an organization concerned about the spread of nuclear
weapons. The group tries to support nuclear ``whistleblowers''
against persecution by their governments, and wanted to be sure the
purported defector was treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
   But, said von Hipple, ``when we got into specifics, it was clear
he didn't know anything about physics or nuclear weapons.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Gonzalez on pace for the impossible
 &HT;    By Dan Graziano
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ He's quiet and relatively unobtrusive, and he trails
Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey both in home runs and interview
requests.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Rangers right fielder Juan Gonzalez was the only
player walking around this year's All-Star Game with 101 RBI, and
that's amazing to everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely unbelievable,'' said McGwire, whose 37 home runs
lead all of baseball. ``It's so remarkable for anybody to have over
100 RBIs by the All Star break. He's a great, great hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   The record for RBI by the All-Star break is 103, by Hank
Greenberg in 1935. How unappreciated a statistic is the RBI?
Greenberg wasn't selected to the All Star team that season.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez is on a pace to challenge Hack Wilson's
single-season record of 190 RBI, set in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different thing than trying to hit home runs,''
Gonzalez said. ``Mark McGwire is the big guy right now in baseball.
If he stays healthy all season, he has a good chance to break the
home run record. I'm in the race for the RBI record, so I have to
stay healthy, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has played 87 games this season. After 87 game sin
1930, Hack Wilson had just 89 RBI. Of course, he hit 53 in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never think about the record,'' Gonzalez said. ``I just
think about getting the runs in.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, as Griffey points out, is something he has a lot of
chances to do since he hits in the middle of that Texas lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really Juan that's impressive, it's the guys in front
of him,'' Griffey said. ``Those getting on base and being in
scoring position, that's what is impressive about the whole thing.
The guys they have hitting one, two and three, they're on base all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact that only six players have ever had as many as
170 RBI in a season (Lou Gehrig did it three times and Greenberg
did it twice), and that no one's done it since 1938 (Jimmie Foxx),
makes it a stat beyond comprehension in today's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one (record) I want to see broken, or at least
somebody make a run at,'' Dodgers and former Marlins outfielder
Gary Sheffield said. ``Because that's...190 RBI? That's
impossible.''

JAILED NIGERIAN DIES DURING ENVOYS' VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nigeria's most prominent political prisoner,
Moshood Abiola, died Tuesday, apparently of a heart attack, further
complicating an already turbulent political situation in Africa's
most populous country.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, who was 60 years old, became ill while meeting with U.S.
and Nigerian officials at a government guest house in Abuja, the
capital. He died shortly afterward in a hospital, U.S. and Nigerian
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said in Washington
on Tuesday, ``We do not have any reason to believe this is anything
but natural causes.'' But at least one of Abiola's children said
the death was suspicious and another said that the government that
had kept her father imprisoned and denied him medical care was
culpable in his death. The Nigerian government promised a full,
prompt autopsy in cooperation with Abiola's personal physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola's death was the second stunning development in Nigeria in
less than a month. On June 9, Gen. Sani Abacha, the unrelenting
dictator who had thrown Abiola into jail in 1994, died suddenly,
also of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, Abacha's successor, had been expected
to free Abiola, the apparent victor in Nigeria's aborted 1993
elections, soon. The U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, said after
meeting Abiola in Nigeria last week that he had promised to
forswear his claim to the presidency and work toward a smooth
transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that Abiola fell ill Tuesday while speaking to Thomas
Pickering, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, and
Susan Rice the assistant secretary for African affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first 10 minutes, Abiola starts wheezing and coughing
and then collapsing in some form,'' Rubin told reporters here. ``I
don't know if he lost consciousness. They get him in an ambulance
or car. They get him to the hospital, where he dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering told National Public Radio that when Abiola came into
the meeting he appeared to be in good health and good spirits, but
that his condition quickly deteriorated and that he began to cough
and was ``clearly disturbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering, speaking by telephone to NPR, explained that Abiola
excused himself from the meeting, went to a restroom, and returned
in more distress. ``When he came out of the toilet, he asked for
painkillers. And then sat on a couch and was overheated and asked
for the room to be cooled, and removed some of his garments, and
then clearly began to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said he took Abiola's pulse and said he was ``clearly
very cold and very disturbed and in some significant pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Abiola was taken to a hospital, accompanied by the U.S.
officials, who watched as doctors worked to save him, Pickering
told the radio program ``All Things Considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering's delegation extended its stay until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hafsat Abiola, the 23-year-old daughter of Abiola, blamed her
father's death on the Nigerian military. In a telephone interview
from suburban Maryland, where she lives with five of her 18
siblings, Ms. Abiola said: ``My position is simple. My father was
in their custody. Anything that happened to him while he was in
their custody is their responsibility. I can't believe they did
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father had not been well lately, Ms. Abiola said, adding
that she had repeatedly asked Nigerian authorities to let a doctor
see him. A U.S. official involved in African policy said that
Abiola suffered from high blood pressure and swollen limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Another daughter, Wura Abiola, told CNN that the family
considered the death ``very suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan said Tuesday he had attempted to inquire about Abiola's
health when he met with him last week. ``He was alert and asked
questions. But it was obvious from the questions that he was in
isolation,'' Annan said. ``For example, he didn't know who I was. I
walked in, shook hands and smiled and started asking about his
health. He asked, `Who are you?' And I explained that I'm the
secretary-general of the United Nations. And then he asked, `What
happened to the Egyptian, is he gone?''' in a reference to Annan's
predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who spoke at an impromptu news conference at the United
Nations on Tuesday, said: ``I'm not in a position to describe the
conditions under which he was kept. But he did say that he had been
in solitary confinement and was allowed no television, no press, no
media except the Bible and the Koran.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan added, ``I hope the government of Nigeria will make good
on its pledge to release all remaining political prisoners
unconditionally and to define a credible process for the transition
to civilian rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Abiola's release had been delayed, in part because Abiola's
followers, mainly members of the Yoruba tribe in southwestern
Nigeria, around the old capital of Lagos, insisted that he should
be permitted to take office. In Lagos on Tuesday some rioting and
looting were reported after the news of Abiola's death, Reuters
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which is dominated by Hausa officers from
Northern Nigeria, now faces the possibility of severe tribal
tensions. In the late 1960s, the Ibo and their allies in
southeastern Nigeria precipitated a civil war when they proclaimed
the independent state of Biafra. Diplomats have expressed fears in
the last few weeks that violence may lie just beneath the surface
now.
</P>
<P>
   Any fighting in Nigeria, which with its oil and natural
resources has the potential for being the richest country in
sub-Saharan Africa, could destabilize the weaker neighboring
countries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

   nn
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by Annan and Western leaders to move his country onto
the road to democracy, Abubakar has already released Gen. Olusegun
Obasanjo, a former military ruler, and 25 other political
prisoners, but 250 or more remain in Lagos jails, intelligence
officials said. Many of them are not nearly as prominent as Abiola,
a wealthy businessman and tribal chief.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that Pickering ``had not received agreement in terms
of a firm timetable to let Abiola out, but the government did make
clear that he would be out soon.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a written statement released Tuesday,
said, ``I was deeply saddened to learn of the sudden and untimely
death of M.K.O. Abiola, a distinguished citizen and patriot of
Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria remains in economic chaos, ravaged by corruption and
incompetence. Despite the country's immense oil reserves _ it is
the fifth-largest supplier of petroleum to the United States _
motorists are forced to wait for hours at the small number of
filling stations that function.
</P>
<P>
   Limited sanctions imposed by the United States and others have
compounded the country's difficulties. Abacha ignored the rest of
the world but Abubakar has appeared eager to reach out to friendly
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's mission to Nigeria, which was not announced in advance,
followed several telephone conversations with Abubakar and a secret
meeting with the Nigerian foreign minister, according to William
Shawcross, a British journalist who covered the Annan visit.
Shawcross said Abubakar told the secretary-general that he wanted
to hand power back to a democratically elected government but
implied that some other generals were not so sure.

MOSHOOD K.O. ABIOLA: FROM WEALTH TO TROUBLED POLITICS TO FLAWED
SYMBOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NIGERIA-ABIOLA. Also moving in `i' news file.)

<P>
   Moshood Kashimawoo Olawale Abiola, who died Tuesday at the age
of 60 just as his release from prison appeared imminent, apparently
won Nigeria's presidency in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of serving in office, he endured years in detention,
in increasingly bad health, and he collapsed Tuesday just as he met
with officials of the United States and of the new Nigerian
government.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola entered the 1993 race as a millionaire businessman and a
traditional leader, with a base of support in the south.
</P>
<P>
   He had attended the Baptist Boys School in his home town,
Abeokuta, in Ogun State, and studied accountancy at the University
of Glasgow. On his return he had lucrative posts with Pfizer of
Nigeria, where he was chief accountant, and with International
Telegraph and Telephone of Nigeria. In 1969 he was named a regional
vice president for ITT and chairman of ITT Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   His wealth grew and so did his holdings. He was the publisher of
Concord Press, a chain of newspapers; the founder of Africa Ocean
Lines; chairman of the Abiola Bookshop, Abiola Farms and Concord
Airlines. He married four women, had many children and lived in a
large home in Lagos on a street bearing his name. Critics said some
of his fortune came from shady deals with both military and
civilian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Then he ran for president and his life changed.
</P>
<P>
   On June 12, 1993, after a decade of military rule, the strongman
then presiding, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, called an election with
civilian candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, a candidate of the center-left Social Democratic party,
ran against Bashir Tofa, a similarly rich businessman, who
represented the center-right National Republican Convention. Both
parties had been established by Babangida, who had stipulated that
there should only be the two new parties, ``one a little to the
left and the other a little to the right.``
</P>
<P>
   Abiola unexpectedly took an early lead and Babangida, who had
been friendly with both candidates, annulled the election. No real
explanations were given. But Tofa was a northerner from the Muslim
Hausa Falani areas, like Babangida and much of the military elite,
while Abiola was from the south and held many traditional African
titles, among them basbortun of Ibadanland and baba adini of
Yorubaland.
</P>
<P>
   After the protests and strikes that followed, Babagida stepped
down, but an interim government was ousted by Gen. Sani Abacha, the
defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola kept a low profile until the first anniversary of the
annulled elections, when he announced that he was ready to claim
the presidency. He was then imprisoned on the orders of Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola had been in detention for almost two years when, on May
8, 1996, his second wife, Kudirat, was seized by police and
questioned after asserting her husband to be Nigeria's rightful
leader. She was ordered to stand trial, but less than a month later
she was shot to death by six armed men who attacked her car.
</P>
<P>
   During his imprisonment, Abiola's family had expressed concern
about his failing health. Such concerns were repeated even as hopes
for his release were raised after Abacha's sudden death from a
heart attack June 8.
</P>
<P>
   At that time Hafsat Abiola, a daughter of Kudirat and Moshood
Abiola who graduated from Harvard and lives in the United States,
spoke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Monday General Abacha, my father's jailer and my mother's
murderer, died, reportedly of a heart attack,'' she wrote in an
Op-Ed piece in The New York Times. ``His successor, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, has called for acceptance as Nigeria's legitimate ruler.
But before the world acknowledges him, some changes must be made.
General Abubakar must release all political prisoners, including my
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Nigerian leader has freed a number of detainees,
but the government seemed to vacillate about Abiola. Just last
Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Nigeria's
leaders and declared that they had pledged to release all political
prisoners, including Abiola.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who had met with Abiola two days earlier, said the
prisoner had agreed to drop his claim to the presidency. But after
Annan left Nigeria, a government statement said Abiola's release
could be delayed if his followers continued to clamor to have him
installed as president. &QL;

leaders and declared that they had pledged to release all political
prisoners, including Abiola.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who had met with Abiola two days earlier, said the
prisoner had agreed to drop his claim to the presidency. But after
Annan left Nigeria, a government statement said Abiola's release
could be delayed if his followers continued to clamor to have him
installed as president. &QL;

 &HT;    Weiss family gets All-Star treatment
 &HT;    (Eds: Corrects headline)
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Everything has been a rush these days for Braves
shortstop Walt Weiss and Tuesday was more rushed than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we got a game tonight?'' Weiss responded, somewhat
sarcastically, when a reporter asked him about his upcoming
All-Star appearance. ``To be honest, I haven't even thought about
it , nothing about it. I just haven't had a chance it's been so
crazy around here. But I think when I get in there it will all hit
me, that I am an All-Star.''
</P>
<P>
   And little Brody was right there to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The spunky 3-year-old who last week at this time was in an
Atlanta hospital bed fighting E. coli, was in section 126 at Coors
Field watching old dad play in the midsummer classic.
</P>
<P>
   At such a young age, Brody probably doesn't have any idea of the
significance of Walt being on the field and his son being in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   But said a proud father, ``I think when all this is over we will
look back at this and really appreciate it as a family. But right
now things are still pretty hectic, I still feel right in the
middle of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Brody was at the game with mother Terri and brother Blake. They
were treated like royalty as this has become a national story, one
that has been written in almost every major-league town. In
Tuesday's Rocky Mountain News, one of two hometown newspapers, the
headline read: ``Weiss still feeling son's illness.'' The city has
welcomed the Weiss' with open arms and well they should with Weiss
having spent four years as a Colorado Rockie. Owner Jerry McMorris
even sent out his private jet to pick the family up in Atlanta and
bring them to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something that I will never forget, that he reached
out to me and my family'' he said. ``Collectively, this city has
been amazing. I can't tell you how nice everyone had been.''
</P>
<P>
   The Weiss' have been staying at their home in a Denver suburb,
something they kept despite Weiss signing with the Braves. And
while Weiss will be heading to Miami tonight where the Braves open
up the second half of the season on Thursday, the family will
remain in Denver as Brody will continue to be checked by their
family doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are out of the woods as far as Brody is
concerned,'' Weiss said. ``There may be some long terms things but
nothing serious.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite all, Weiss has been very patient, answering one
question after another, doing radio and television interviews. He
never said an ugly word, never snapped at anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But for several hours Tuesday night, Weiss' attention shifted
back on the field. When he was introduced to the crowd, he received
a standing ovation. It was the longest of the pregame activities,
even longer than that of fan favorite Cal Ripken Jr. And on the big
screen television, there was Brody sitting on Terri's lap, both
smiling away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what to expect out there,'' he said. ``I
haven't thought about what it would be like. But I have always
wanted to be an All-Star.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, both on and off the field.

   Hillary Rodham Clinton will visit Pittsfield, Mass. next week as
part of a four-day bus tour of ``America's Treasures.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady's press office said she will kick off the tour in
Washington next Monday, but would not confirm the sites to be
visited. However the Berkshire Eagle reported Tuesday that it would
be Pittsfield's historic Colonial Theater.
</P>
<P>
   An official announcement of the trip will be made Wednesday,
said Julie Mason, a Clinton spokeswoman. ``She's hoping to
highlight some of these pieces of our heritage,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   On the four-day trip, the First Lady will visit potential
preservation sites, Mason said. Mrs. Clinton is honorary chairwoman
of the Millennium Committee to Save America's Treasures, a
public-private partnership created to preserve historic sites and
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The trip will begin Monday at the Smithsonian's Museum of
American History, where the President and Mrs. Clinton will view
the original copy of ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   The culmination of the trip will be in Seneca Falls, N.Y., for

JENNIFER DUNN FINDS A RARITY ON HER CAMPAIGN TRAIL: A DETERMINED
CHALLENGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ With her name increasingly mentioned as a
post-Gingrich Speaker of the House, Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., is
campaigning across the country and opening her ample coffers to
worthy GOP candidates for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In her district east of Seattle, however, Dunn faces something
unusual _ a determined opponent in Heidi Behrens-Benedict.
Democrats are trying to convince themselves that Dunn, who hasn't
had a serious challenge in years, is ripe for an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, 57, vows never to be caught napping. ``I don't mess around
with campaigns,'' she said. ``I always take my opponents seriously
and run full bore campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Behrens-Benedict, 50, is a political novice, drawn into the 8th
District race by her outrage at the recent shootings at a
Springfield, Ore., high school and the feeling that she needed to
take a stand against gun violence and the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I researched Jennifer's votes in the House and found her
record so polarizing, 100 percent for the National Rifle
Association and zero for children, that it does not represent folks
in this district,'' she said. ``I think Dunn is voting the straight
right-wing party line. She is out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``As mothers and parents, it is our obligation to protect our
children, not only the children of our body but the children of our
community and country. I am the person to make that case against
Jennifer Dunn.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a shot aimed directly at the core of Dunn's efforts these
days. Dunn has spearheaded an extensive post-1996 Republican effort
to uncover and remedy the party's weakness with women voters, which
doomed Bob Dole's presidential candidacy two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn has also been given increasing public exposure as a
comforting presence in a House GOP leadership known for its harsh
public statements on social policy. ``They bring her in to be the
picture of what today's Republican woman should be,'' said Cathy
Allen, a liberal Seattle political consultant who has, nonetheless,
been courted in Dunn's effort to make the Republican Party more
appealing to women.
</P>
<P>
   One shot by a challenger does not win a war. Dunn has already
gone over the $1 million mark in her fund raising.
Behrens-Benedict, a small business owner, has raised about $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, a three-term House member, has enjoyed only token
opposition in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, Democratic-aligned constituency groups, while
opposed to Dunn, are muted in their support for Behrens-Benedict's
side.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Cooper, state director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, has long argued that Dunn talks a pro-choice line
while voting to restrict abortions for poor women. ``We'll probably
endorse _ What's her name? Heidi? _ but the resources, I don't
know,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Arthur, the Sierra Club's Northwest director, gets mad
every time he sees one of Dunn's TV spots featuring herds of elk or
the congresswoman in a canoe. Dunn's latest rating on environmental
votes by the League of Conservation Voters is 6 (out of 100).
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't looked particularly at that race, no,'' Arthur
said. ``Whether or not we will, I don't know. I'm going to be
hard-pressed to move beyond the races we have already staked out.
We try to be in places where we can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn is leaving nothing to chance. Last week, at the Bellevue
Botanical Garden, she assembled a powerful lineup of
conservationists and good-government activists to announce
legislation designed to preserve commercial forest lands at a time
of rapid population growth.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would allow local governments to issue bonds, which
would be used by non-profit groups to buy up forest land. Trees
would be cut, but at less intensity and with more preservation of
recreation land and streamside habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an environmental policy that is out of the lands of
government and into the hands of local communities,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   James Ellis, a Seattle civic leader whose causes have ranged
from cleanup of Lake Washington to the Mountains-to-Sound Greenway,
praised Dunn as ``a national leader of significant ability and
prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn has the power to push such ideas. She has a seat on the
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, and is vice chairwoman
of the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn is promising that the GOP-run 105th Congress will be able
to point to accomplishments by the time it adjourns at the end of
September. She predicts a ``narrowly focused tobacco bill,'' reform
of the Internal Revenue Service, and a limited patient's bill of
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn has a knack for making controversial leadership positions
palatable. On patients rights, House GOP chieftains torpedoed a
sweeping accountability plan for health maintenance organizations
submitted by Republican Reps. Greg Ganske of Iowa and Charlie
Norwood of Georgia. Ganske is a surgeon, Norwood a dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they wanted was too many regulations,'' Dunn said. And,
as on many other issues, she promised that the leadership's
scaled-back health plan ``will have no new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn is a poised picture of power. Behrens-Benedict is
passionate but unschooled in what has been her opponent's
profession for two decades. ``Lack of experience is like natural
childbirth,'' the challenger joked. ``Lots of this I do not know,
but I am not naive.''
</P>
<P>
   Behrens-Benedict bristles at the suggestion that Democrats may
be using her to tie down Dunn and keep Dunn's fund-raising prowess
from deployment in other, closer races. ``I am in this for the long
haul and I actually expect to win,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One symbol of Dunn's leisurely 1992, 1994 and 1996 races was an
oft-aired TV spot showing her canoeing with one of her two sons. As
if to acknowledge that Dunn has a serious foe, she has retired the
canoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my favorite commercial of all time, but we're going to do
something different this year,'' she said.

COMMENTARY: IN ALL HIS FEATHERED GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Erik Tarloff's mother cut a deal with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Frank Sinatra ever came on to her, she was allowed to go
with him for one night, with no repercussions in the marriage,'' he
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Tarloff, a writer who saw Washington from a rare perspective as
the husband of a Cabinet-level official, the former Clinton chief
economic adviser Laura D'Andrea Tyson, thought of his mother's
groupie exemption when he wrote his new Washington novel,
``Face-Time.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, not yet published, is about a young woman who works in
the White House, along with her boyfriend, a speechwriter. She
succumbs to the advances of a Clintonesque president because she
feels it is an experience that transcends infidelity, and even sex.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Marilyn Monroe mused to her psychiatrist about her
relationship with JFK: ``Marilyn Monroe is a soldier. ... The first
duty of a soldier is to obey her commander in chief.''
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, Bill Clinton's biggest legacy may not
be in politics, but in letters. Aside from the flock of fiction and
nonfiction books written about our intriguing president, he has
inspired one entirely new and remarkable genre: feminist erotic
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   After decades spent trying to dissuade powerful men from
thinking they can have their way with less powerful women,
feminists now have a terrible confession: They pant for power. They
crave droit du seigneur. Take me! Take me!
</P>
<P>
   First, Larissa MacFarquhar wrote of Monica Lewinsky in The New
Yorker that ``It would be a rare young woman who could resist ... a
chance to sleep with a man who is (a) the president and (b) a
babe.''
</P>
<P>
   Then 10 women, including some feminists, a fashion designer and
a retired dominatrix, participated in a panel for The New York
Observer that resulted in a story headlined ``New York Supergals
Love That Naughty Prez.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there has been a shift in the cultural climate since
the time of the Anita Hill hearings,'' said Katie Roiphe, adding:
``Now, this virile president is suddenly fulfilling this forbidden
fantasy of this old-fashioned, taboo aggressive male. I think women
are finding that appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tina Brown wrote her bodice-ripping dispatch from the Tony Blair
state dinner about Clinton: ``His glamour is undersung ... a man in
a dinner jacket with more heat than any star in the room (or, for
that matter, at the multiplex) ... his height, his sleekness, his
newly cropped, iron-filing hair, and the intensity of his blue
eyes. ... He is vividly in the present tense and dares you to join
him there.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest swooner is Nina Burleigh, a former White House
reporter for Time, who writes in Mirabella about a game of hearts
with Clinton on Air Force One flying to Jasper, Ark., that made her
tingle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's foot lightly, and presumably accidentally,
brushed mine once under the table. His hand touched my wrist while
he was dealing the cards. When I got up and shook his hand at the
end of the game, his eyes wandered over my bike-wrecked, naked
legs. And slowly it dawned on me as I walked away: He found me
attractive. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when the hormones of indignant feminism raged
in my veins. An open gaze like that, at least from a man of lesser
stature, would have annoyed me. But that evening ... I felt
incandescent. It was riveting to know that the president had
appreciated my legs, scarred as they were. If he had asked me to
continue the game of hearts back in his room at the Jasper Holiday
Inn, I would have been happy to go there and see what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Nina outflutters Tina, casting Bill as Zeus in ``Leda
and the Swan'': ``Yeats honored the magnetic sexual pull a powerful
male can have on a weaker female. The beating wings of the giant
swan enwrap the helplessly infatuated woman, whose `terrified vague
fingers' cannot push the `feathered glory from her loosening
thighs.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Burleigh may have presidential affairs on the brain since
she just wrote a book about Mary Meyer, a JFK paramour who was
murdered. Defending her piece to The Washington Post, she noted
that she would have happily had a certain kind of sex with Clinton
``just to thank him for keeping abortion legal.''
</P>
<P>
   We should stop blaming Ally McBeal for killing feminism. We
should even stop blaming Bill Clinton. It is clearly a mass
suicide. &QL;

 (Subs for rewriting throughout. Story is now complete in 1
take) MARKHASEV FOUND GUILTY OF MURDERING ENNIS COSBY 
 (sw) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A jury took less than six hours on Tuesday to find
19-year-old Mikail Markhasev guilty of murdering Ennis Cosby, the
son of the entertainer Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   Markhasev smiled briefly in the packed courtroom as the verdict
was read, then he stood expressionless as the slain man's mother
and sisters hugged each other and began to sob.
</P>
<P>
   Markhasev was found guilty of first-degree murder and attempted
robbery under circumstances that could bring him a sentence of life
in prison without parole. Judge David Perez of Superior Court in
Santa Monica scheduled the sentencing for Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   While prosecutors lauded the verdict, Henry Hall, one of the two
public defenders who represented Markhasev, said at a news
conference afterward that he believed the intense media scrutiny
and fame of Cosby's father had turned attention away from a sober
analysis of the evidence and had brought about an unfair verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Hall made a fine distinction. He said the jury was not directly
tainted and that ``the celebrity of the Cosby family I don't think
had a direct impact on the trial.'' But he also insisted, ``The
societal presumption was that there would be a conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Ingalls, the deputy district attorney who prosecuted the
case, vigorously dispute Hall's assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the jury was extremely responsible in what they
did,'' Ms. Ingalls said. ``I think that the evidence convicted Mr.
Markhasev. I think that Mr. Markhasev convicted Mr. Markhasev and
not the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cosby attended the trial for the first time on Monday, the
day the closing arguments concluded. He was there with his wife,
Camille, and his daughters Erika and Erinn.
</P>
<P>
   He was not present on Tuesday, but through a spokesman he issued
a statement after the verdict was read, saying, ``The Cosby family
is satisfied with the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   Ennis Cosby was 27 and a doctoral student of education at
Columbia University when he was fatally shot once in the head while
changing a flat tire alongside a highway in the early morning hours
of Jan. 16, 1997. The police said it appeared to have been an
unplanned but botched robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the entirely circumstantial nature of the prosecution's
case, which relied on a hair found with the murder weapon, letters
handed over by a man facing unrelated forgery charges and a tip to
the National Enquirer, the jury seemed to have dispatched quickly
with Markhasev's defense that a friend of his had actually shot
Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   In the letters prosecutors said Markhasev wrote after his
arrest, to the forgery suspect and others, a fellow inmate in the
county jail, he referred to the Cosby killing as a ``robbery gone
bad.'' DNA evidence showed that the hair, found inside a cap
wrapped around the murder weapon, was almost certainly Markhasev's.
And Christopher So, who was paid $40,000 by The National Enquirer
for interviews and stands to get a $100,000 reward from the
magazine if Markhasev is convicted because he led the police to the
murder weapon, testified that Markhasev had said he shot a black
man, and that ``It's all over the news.''
</P>
<P>
   But Markhasev's mother testified that her son had been with her
the night of the murder, and his lawyers had argued that the
incriminating letters had been forged.
</P>
<P>
   The trial began with several claims that were ultimately
unsubstantiated. Early in the trial the prosecution made the
sensational claim that Markhasev was a member of a notorious prison
gang, and Markhasev's lawyers said they would prove that Eli
Zakaria, a friend of Markhasev, had committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   None of the those assertions were proved. Ultimately, the case
boiled down to the accidental and ultimately tragic crossing of the
paths of the two young men, one who had done reasonably well in
school after immigrating here from the Ukraine before sliding into
a life of crime, and the other apparently working hard to build a
career as an educator out of the shadow of his wealthy and famous
father.
</P>
<P>
   Markhasev was arrested in March, 1997, after a highly publicized
police search following what appeared from the start to have been a
senseless crime. Ennis Cosby had apparently been driving in his
father's Mercedes-Benz to visit a friend when the car got a flat
tire. He pulled off the highway at a quiet spot and called a friend
to help him change the tire.
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Stephanie Crane, showed up and witnessed a man
threatening Cosby. She was forced to leave, then came back to find
Cosby dead, she testified.
</P>
<P>
   The police used her description to create a sketch of the
murderer, but they were unable to make an arrest until The National
Enquirer received a tip from So, a friend of Markhasev, who hoped
to claim the $100,000 reward. So led the police to a field where
they found the gun that seemed to have been used in the killing.
Markhasev was arrested and charged with the crime shortly
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Markhasev never took the witness stand. His lawyers argued that
the witnesses against him were motivated by greed and a desire to
receive more favorable treatment from police in unrelated charges
that each of them faced.

BRAZIL GOALIE HAS ANSWER FOR BRAZIL FANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSEILLES, France _ Without a job as recently as 1995, Claudio
Taffarel was fully employed Tuesday night, and when he had finished
his long evening's work in the Brazilian goal, his gift for getting
in the way of penalty kicks had made him a soccer hero at home
again.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he stopped three in a semifinal victory over the
Germans at the Summer Olympics in Seoul. In 1994, he stopped one
and watched attempts by Franco Baresi and Roberto Baggio sail over
his crossbar in the victory over Italy in the World Cup final.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, he was back in the crucible against the Dutch in
the semifinals, and after his more famous teammates Ronaldo,
Roberto Carlos and Rivaldo failed to make the difference in 120
minutes of conventional soccer, Taffarel calmly took his spot on
the goal line and took over.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch captain, Frank de Boer, and the star striker Dennis
Bergkamp, who took the first two penalty kicks for the Netherlands,
both scored, but Taffarel had still guessed the direction of their
shots correctly. He would do better against the next two Dutchmen:
diving to his left to block Philip Cocu and diving to his right to
deflect the shot of de Boer's twin brother, Ronald.
</P>
<P>
   What he proved unable to fend off was the human wave of
Brazilian players and officials who quickly engulfed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so very happy, and I hope that the Brazilian people now
will trust me and the team more,'' Taffarel said. ``They have been
very hard on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Taffarel owes his place on the national team to the trust of
coach Mario Zagallo, who chose to ignore Brazilian critics who
believed Taffarel was too old and slow at 32 to play in a third
consecutive World Cup. There were calls for Dida, a 24-year-old who
plays for the Brazilian club Cruzeiro; calls for Carlos Germano, a
28-year-old who plays for the Brazilian club Vasco de Gama.
</P>
<P>
   But Zagallo held firm, and Tuesday night, with a reflex save off
a Bergkamp blast early in the second half and his two educated
guesses in the penalty kick phase, Taffarel returned the favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud that I was able to show my gratitude for the
opportunity that Zagallo gave me,'' Taffarel said.
</P>
<P>
   The goalkeeper also showed his gratitude to God. Since 1988, he
has been a member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes _ a group
to which teammate Cesar Sampaio also belongs _ and after stopping
De Boer's shot, he stared into the summer sky and said a few words.
</P>
<P>
   Faith has long proved important to Taffarel, and he said last
week that it seldom helped him more than in November 1994, when,
after playing a key role in Brazil's run to an unprecedented fourth
World Cup title, he found himself out of a job after failing to
impress his employers at the Italian first division club Reggiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``World champion and no club,'' he said. ``It's incredible but
true. For seven months, I was unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   But not inactive. To occupy his ample free time, he played
striker for a church team in the suburbs of Reggiana, wearing No. 9
instead of his customary No. 1. Though he scored 15 goals in seven
matches, he eventually found work in the Brazilian first division,
and he has now found more profitable work beginning this fall with
the Turkish club Galatasaray, which recently signed him to a
two-year contract worth $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeepers are seldom the focus in Brazil, a nation where
strikers and playmakers are the heroes that youngsters imitate on
the beaches and in the city streets. But after Tuesday night, it is
possible that young Brazilians may be busy imitating Taffarel along
with Ronaldo this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite becoming a goalkeeper at the advanced age of 17,
Taffarel and the team captain, Dunga, now have appeared in more
matches in the World Cup finals than any other Brazilians before
them: 18. Taffarel only hopes his 19th on Sunday in the final does
not have quite so thrilling a finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more penalty kicks,'' he said. ``I know the Brazilians
suffer too much when we get to that stage.'' &QL;

BRAZIL DEFEATS NETHERLANDS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSEILLE _ Brazil's dream of an unprecedented fifth World Cup
title appeared in danger so many times Tuesday night that when it
lived on, thanks to two tremendous saves by Claudio Taffarel, there
seemed to be more to it than what was readily apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Taffarel, never the most capable of goalkeepers, was
otherworldly when it mattered most, stopping the Netherlands in the
shootout as the Brazilians, despite spending much of the match on
their heels, earned the chance to defend their title with a
semifinal triumph at Stade Velodrome in Marseille.
</P>
<P>
   Diving left to stop Phillip Cocu, then right to halt Ronald de
Boer, Taffarel handed the world's most respected team a 4-2 victory
on penalty kicks following an often stirring 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't me,'' he protested when it was over. ``This was God
helping me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians, despite a superb Ronaldo goal seconds into the
second half, needed supreme guidance to survive as Holland,
outplaying them at their own game, created chance after chance
after chance.
</P>
<P>
   That only one of them, an 87th-minute header by Patrick
Kluivert, found the net had more to do with Dutch inaccuracy
Brazil's defensive brilliance, although the South Americans in a
move that seemed to go against everything they espouse spent most
of the second half bundled up in front of their net, using a
counterattack as their only weapon.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wise tactic that nearly paid off with a regulation
victory; Kluivert's goal, Holland's fourth late tally of the
tournament, ended that, and the 30-minute overtime period that
followed brought the sort of soccer anticipated from these powers:
attacking, entertaining, often enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over after penalty kicks had determined the
Brazilians would play on, against France or Croatia at the Stade de
France, and that Holland would meet the other in Saturday's
third-place game Brazil coach Mario Zagallo wept openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penalties are a lottery,'' he said, ``but I went to the
players one by one and told them we are going to win this
championship. ... In Brazil right now people are celebrating. We're
only going to celebrate at the final.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch, he admitted, ``were superior, but they didn't know
how to translate this into goals.'' The inability of Dennis
Bergkamp, Holland's top forward, to make any impact whatsoever,
didn't help, but they had plenty of chances in the second half and
overtime to take control.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil had the upper hand once Ronaldo fired it ahead with his
fourth goal of the Cup. It occurred off the second-half kickoff,
with Rivaldo sending a ball into the box from the left flank,
curling it ahead of the onrushing striker, who took it on the
outside of his left foot, then placed it neatly under goalkeeper
Edwin Van der Sar all the while fending off Cocu.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, the Brazilians sat back and let the Dutch
own the ball, limiting most of their attacks to counters. Unable to
penetrate, the Dutch created just two strong chances a Jaap Stam
blast off a corner kick that Taffarel stopped, and a Kluivert
misfire off a fine give-and-go with substitute Pierre Van Hooijdonk
before Kluivert evened things with only three minutes plus injury
time to play.
</P>
<P>
   The counter nearly served up a handful of Brazilian goals. Twice
Ronaldo bore down on Van der Sar, once in overtime, but Edgar
Davids and Frank de Boer the two best players on the field took him
out of the play. On the former, Davids was fortunate not to pick up
a second yellow card or surrender a penalty kick, and Ronaldo fired
inches wide of the post.
</P>
<P>
   Rivaldo, too, nearly tallied, but Stam redirected a Denilson
feed under the Brazilian; by the time Rivaldo got his shot off, Van
der Sar was there to bury it.
</P>
<P>
   Kluivert's goal was superb. It came off a turnover, a poor
clearance off Davids' chest that Cocu headed down, then sent to
Ronald de Boer on the right wing. De Boer's cross found Kluivert
all alone about 8 yards out, and his header left Taffarel no
chance.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded chances in overtime, with Ronaldo twice coming
close Frank de Boer making the big stop and Kluivert firing just
wide of the far post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extra time,'' Zagallo said, ``was all heart, disposition,
determination.''
</P>
<P>
   That sent the game to the shootout, in which Brazil has had
notable success before. In its triumph over Italy in the 1994
final, Taffarel had little to do, watching two Italians Franco
Baresi and Roberto Baggio clearing the crossbar with shots.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he came up big.
</P>
<P>
   The first five shooters Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Emerson for Brazil,
and Frank de Boer and Bergkamp for the Dutch connected, but Cocu
put his shot too close to center, and Taffarel easily knocked it
away.
</P>
<P>
   Dunga followed with a drive over the diving Van der Sar to make
it 4-2, and then Ronald de Boer's attempt to the lower left found
an outstretched Taffarel instead of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like lotto,'' Ronald de Boer said. ``It should go in
there. It's a very dreadful feeling; that's all I can say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream is over. It's a pity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutch coach Guus Hiddink, who was missing two starters injured
winger Marc Overmars and suspended defender Arthur Numan as well as
Numan's planned replacement, injured Winston Bogarde, tried to keep
from making excuses for losing and failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hide behind excuses,'' he said. ``It's always
rather cheap to (bring up players who can't play). I don't want to
look at this as an excuse. I think we have a good squad. ... You
must not look for excuses like injuries or a day less rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Taffarel didn't need to look for reasons for the win, and he
acknowledged it wasn't victory enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't won anything yet except a very tough battle,'' he
said. ``This Brazil is ready to be five-times champion. And we'll
do everything we can to win it. The team is very much ready for the
final.''

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Surrounded on a beach by 10,000
Brazilians as obsessed and captive to soccer as she was, Daniele
Fernandes Monteiro, a 23-year-old saleswoman, exhorted the painted,
flag-draped fans to form a human chain and beam luck to the
national soccer team playing in Marseilles, France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's send them strength,'' she shouted over the fans staring
at the big television screen on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   When the Netherlands scored its only goal 42 minutes into the
second half, tying the game at 1-1, Maria de Lourdes Carvalho, a
68-year-old grandmother, threw her hands over her face and wept.
``I felt the world collapse at my feet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of her family had traveled to France to watch
to the Brazilian team attempt to win its fifth World Cup. Her
sister, Maria Victoria de Carvalho, clasped her hand. ``It's like
the end of the world,'' the older de Carvalho said.
</P>
<P>
   As the game went into sudden death, Monteiro formed a tight
circle with her friends, one of them already red-eyed and
disconsolate, to pray for victory, which came, excruciatingly,
after Brazil scored on 4 penalty kicks to the Netherlands' 2.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how victory came, Brazil was awash in celebration
Tuesday night, with tens of thousands turning out for parties that
would last until dawn, triggering an instant, spontaneous Carnaval
in the middle of the Southern Hemisphere's winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fanaticism; it's patriotism from the heart,'' said
Maria Vasconcelos, a 39-year-old psychologist who showed up
dripping from a swim to watch the game.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto da Matta, an anthropology professor at the University of
Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind., sees the country's love affair with
soccer as a drama in which the cultural qualities that define
Brazil _ the inventiveness, energy, optimism, the mixture of the
races and utter lack of orthodoxy _ compete and, increasingly, win.
``It gives the Brazilian people an experience of victory that we
know very little about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides us with this incredible view of the possibilities
of the body,'' he added. ``Here we have the body encompassing the
soul and bringing the soul back, reborn. Victory is public, it's
not a secret, so this experience of victory, this collective
orgasm, is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from the smallest towns like Tatajuba in northeastern
Brazil, where residents gather in the main square to watch the
town's only television set, to the bars where fans forget to order
beer and chips, to this enormous beach gathering in Niteroi, across
the bridge from Rio, all of Brazil has been riveted by the
country's quest for another title.
</P>
<P>
   Green and yellow streamers flutter over streets, while the
Brazilian flag _ whose main feature is a globe that, these days,
looks much like a soccer ball _ cascades over entire apartment
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   All the major Brazilian dailies have sent not only their sports
columnists to report on the games, but also their gossip writers
and political analysts. Nelson Rodrigues, the late Brazilian
journalist, once wrote that all Brazilians feel a stake in the game
because it represents ``the nation in soccer shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, that nation is dancing. &QL;

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Pete Wilson began his tenure here
seven summers ago with the largest budget gap that any state ever
faced, a $14.3 billion shortfall that forced him and the
Legislature to raise $7 billion in new taxes and slash spending by
the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   The budget was finally passed 17 days after the July 1 deadline,
and the next year the wrangling was even worse, with a record
63-day standoff over how to spread the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wilson is in his last year in office, contemplating another
run for the White House and eager to leave a legacy _ and
California is once again without a budget one week into the new
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, as in other state capitals buoyed by a strong
economy this season, the fight is over what to do with a surplus _
$4.4 billion generated by the Golden State's booming economic
recovery _ and while the question now is about cutting taxes and
expanding services, the debate is proving just as bitter as before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bigger problem, in a way,'' said John Burton, the
beleaguered Democratic leader of the state Senate, who noted that a
surplus _ in an election year to boot _ inspires less cooperation
and more partisanship than in tough times.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson agreed, saying dryly of his adversaries in the
Democratic-controlled Legislature, ``They seem to find it more
difficult to come to grips with plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurred on by states like Virginia and Arizona, where the issue
has proved to be political catnip, Wilson and his fellow
Republicans want a $3.6 billion cut in the state's vehicle-license
tax over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   That would amount to a 75 percent reduction in the unpopular
tax, a Depression-era relic that is based on 2 percent of a
vehicle's value (adjusted by a set depreciation schedule) and
translates into several hundred dollars a year for owners of newer
cars. Such a cut would also allow Wilson to claim that, overall, he
has reduced taxes more than he has raised them in his two terms in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Because the car tax revenues go to cities and counties to
finance local services, the Democrats contend that cutting the tax
could jeopardize police protection if the economy took a turn for
the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in what was regarded as no more than an opening bid,
the Democratic-controlled Senate unanimously passed an alternative,
a one-year, one-quarter-cent cut in the state's 6 percent sales
tax, and on Monday, the Assembly followed suit. But Wilson derided
the idea as ``much too little and much too brief'' and vowed to
veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said in an interview that he expected face-to-face
negotiations with the governor and the Democratic Assembly speaker,
Antonio Villaraigosa, to begin soon, but the Assembly and Senate
have yet to agree on an overall budget plan of their own.
</P>
<P>
   And Burton and Villaraigosa have held their posts for just a few
months, replacing colleagues forced to move on by term limits,
while Wilson, himself barred from seeking a third term, is a
veteran with a proven stomach for budget standoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And despite being in his last year as governor, Wilson is
provided with strong advantages by the state Constitution. It
requires a two-thirds vote in each house for the budget to be
passed, making it hard for the Democrats to peel off enough
Republicans to force the governor's hand, and it gives the governor
line-item veto power to punish legislators by cutting their pet
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart money is looking at late August now,'' said Dan
Schnur, a former top aide to Wilson who is a political consultant
in San Francisco. ``In the past, the choices have been so painful
that they led to paralysis. It takes two or three months to decide
whether you're going to take guide dogs away from blind people. But
there isn't any road map for what they're dealing with now.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Wilson said that it should not take so
long to reach agreement, but he added that he would not be
surprised if it did, noting that ``there doesn't seem to be even
common direction'' among the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And the governor dismissed any notion that the surplus is a
sort-term phenomenon. Beginning two years ago, with the recovery
reaching full force, the state's revenue collections started
exceeding forecasts, and there was a somewhat smaller surplus last
year, though Wilson curtailed debate over how to spend it, by
unilaterally using most of it to replenish a state pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep having these nonrecurring surpluses,'' he said
sardonically, adding that this situation means ``California's tax
structure takes too big a bite.'' Wilson argues that the vehicle
tax, which costs the average car owner $185 a year, is particularly
onerous and affects almost everyone in a state with 24 million
registered vehicles, more than there are houses. His proposal would
save the average owner $135 a year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nineteen states and the District of Columbia impose no
value-based taxes on motor vehicles, opting for flat annual
registration fees. But the 31 remaining states impose either a
personal-property tax on cars or, like California, a value-based
tax in lieu of property tax.
</P>
<P>
   In California's case, the car tax is the sole legacy of the
state's old personal-property tax, in which assessors visited homes
each year to survey the value of contents. But cars were always
mysteriously absent from driveways on assessment day, so in 1935
the state abandoned the personal-property tax in favor of a tax on
cars, imposed at annual registration.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures
found considerable support around the nation for rolling back such
taxes, after the successful candidacy for governor of James Gilmore
III in Virginia, who campaigned last year on a platform of reducing
that state's local property tax on automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, states including Kansas, Kentucky, Rhode Island,
South Carolina and Arizona have either passed reductions or are
considering them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tax is particularly disliked,'' said Mandy Rafool, a
conference policy analyst who conducted the study. ``People hate
property taxes in general, and this is a big chunk at once.''
</P>
<P>
   All the players here agree that there will be a tax cut, with
the only question being how big. Both sides are also proposing more
spending on education, with the Democrats demanding more than
Wilson has offered. But the governor repeated Tuesday that he was
``not interested in temporary relief'' from taxes and said that the
Legislature had so far offered no more than ``this little drill.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Burton _ an old Sacramento hand who is on his
second career after a stint here and in Congress collapsed as a
result of alcohol and drug abuse _ confessed in an interview, ``All
I want is to get out alive.'' &QL;

TEEN PLEADS GUILTY IN EYE GOUGING, IS SENTENCED TO MILITARY SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MEDE NIX 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Just before a judge expected to declare a mistrial
Tuesday because of a deadlocked jury, a high school wrestler agreed
to a plea bargain for gouging the eyes of a gang member during a
fight and will be sent to a military school in Pennsylvania until
he turns 18.
</P>
<P>
   The swift and surprising conclusion to 21/2 days of
deliberations by a jury that repeatedly declared it could not reach
a decision left female friends of the former wrestler, Daniel G.
Johnson, 17, in tears and friends of the almost-blinded
16-year-old, Jason Prickett, shocked that Johnson was headed to
Glen Mills School in a Philadelphia suburb instead of a Texas Youth
Commission facility.
</P>
<P>
   But District Judge Hal Gaither, who called prosecutors and
defense attorneys together Tuesday afternoon to tell them he
expected a mistrial Wednesday, said it was the best solution. The
military academy is renowned for dealing with gang members and
youths with anger and aggression problems.
</P>
<P>
   Gaither told Johnson that if he gets into trouble at Glen Mills,
he faces 20 years in prison, the maximum sentence for the
second-degree felony of aggravated assault. But if he successfully
completes the program at Glen Mills, it will be as if he never had
a criminal record. Johnson will turn 18 on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he would agree to anything that would get him back
in school,'' defense attorney David Scoggins said of his client.
``The state wanted TYC, and we wanted probation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gaither declined both, noting that juvenile courts will have
jurisdiction over Johnson only until he turns 18. Gaither said he
has sent about ``10 kids'' to Glen Mills, which costs about $96 a
day, compared to about $120 per day to keep a youth in a Texas
Youth Commission facility, he said. Texas will pay for his
Pennsylvania stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen Mills is run just like West Point is run,'' he said. ``It
is very discipline-oriented. It costs somewhat less to go to Glen
Mills, but the issue is what's best for the community. I'm
satisfied that this is best for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Ward, 16, a friend of Prickett, said: ``I don't feel that
his sentence was strong enough. It should have been a lot stronger.
Jason is blind for life and (Johnson) is going to a military school
for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Prickett's mother, Beverly, who testified that her son's medical
bills are up to about $20,000, asked the judge to sentence Johnson
to a Texas Youth Commission facility. She said she cannot pay the
bills and she has applied for help from a victim's assistance fund.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was a glimpse into the haves and have-nots of suburban
teen life in Richardson, a suburb of Dallas. Friends of Prickett,
with unusual hairstyles, multiple earrings and baggy clothes, held
an uneasy truce in the halls of the Henry Wade Juvenile Justice
Center with Johnson's well-dressed upper-middle-class friends from
J.J. Pearce High School.
</P>
<P>
   The defense made much of Prickett's status as a ninth-grade
dropout and leader of a street gang called Third Power, contending
Prickett precipitated the fight with threats against Johnson and
other Pearce students. But the prosecution made no apologies for
Prickett's lifestyle. Prosecutor Denise Hale said Prickett ``is
what he is'' but did not deserve what he got. Prickett lost sight
in his left eye and has impaired vision in his right, injuries that
prosecutors said went far beyond self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson testified Wednesday that he gouged Prickett's eyes in
self-defense during a confrontation between gang members and Pearce
athletes in a Richardson field April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Prickett, who was not in court when the compromise was reached,
told his friends that he is upset with the outcome and didn't want
to talk, said another friend, Shawn Smith, 20.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were pleased that Johnson pleaded guilty but were
disappointed with the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like he was a candidate for TYC,'' said Charlie Martin,
another prosecutor. ``It was vicious. But at least he won't be in
Richardson, Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen's father, Jerry Johnson, said he is relieved that the
matter was resolved, but said his son should have been cleared of
the charges. He said his son was trying to protect others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected Danny to be released. He was righting everything
that they were doing. He stood up for his friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Johnson said his son regrets that Prickett was so badly
injured. ``He is sorry the boy was injured. He is not an
optometrist. He didn't know how much damage he did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors did not talk to the media, but Gaither said they told him
they were hung up over the issue of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some confusion over the testimony and who did what
and when,'' Gaither said. ``They were solidly entrenched, but they
were willing to work through it.''

   On Thursday, before last week's holiday break, jurors told the
judge they were deadlocked at 9-3. On Monday, it was a 10-2
deadlock, but notes to the judge never indicated which verdict the
majority favored. Gaither said he wouldn't reveal that either,
although defense attorneys speculated that the majority was in
favor of a finding of delinquent conduct, which is equivalent to a
guilty verdict in adult court.
</P>
<P>
   Gaither said that if he had declared a mistrial, he would have
rescheduled the trial for July 20. In a second trial, the
prosecution would have had an advantage because it would have seen
all the defense's case and bolstered its weaknesses, Gaither said.

   Glen Mills School is a private, nonprofit, all-male residential
treatment program in Concordville, Pa., specializing in treating
tough, gang-oriented youths from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   All students must compete in sports and are pushed hard to earn
their high school diplomas and complete courses in vocational
skills. The school, which has no fences or bars, has produced
numerous college graduates and even Rhodes Scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which was modeled after West Point, operates on the
philosophy that changes in behavior come from peer pressure,
positive staff members and role models and recognition of personal
effort. Students have to earn privileges, such as going home for
holidays.

TEEN ENTERS PLEA IN EYE GOUGING, IS SENTENCED TO MILITARY SCHOOL

<P>
   DALLAS _ Just before a judge expected to declare a mistrial
Tuesday because of a deadlocked jury, a high school wrestler agreed
to a plea bargain for gouging the eyes of a gang member during a
fight and will be sent to a military school in Pennsylvania until
he turns 18.
</P>
<P>
   The swift and surprising conclusion to 21/2 days of
deliberations by a jury that repeatedly declared it could not reach
a decision left female friends of the former wrestler, Daniel G.
Johnson, 17, in tears and friends of the almost-blinded
16-year-old, Jason Prickett, shocked that Johnson was headed to
Glen Mills School in a Philadelphia suburb instead of a Texas Youth
Commission facility.
</P>
<P>
   But District Judge Hal Gaither, who called prosecutors and
defense attorneys together Tuesday afternoon to tell them he
expected a mistrial Wednesday, said it was the best solution. The
military academy is renowned for dealing with gang members and
youths with anger and aggression problems.
</P>
<P>
   Gaither told Johnson that if he gets into trouble at Glen Mills,
he faces 20 years in prison, the maximum sentence for the
second-degree felony of aggravated assault. But if he successfully
completes the program at Glen Mills, it will be as if he never had
a criminal record. Johnson will turn 18 on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he would agree to anything that would get him back
in school,'' defense attorney David Scoggins said of his client.
``The state wanted TYC, and we wanted probation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gaither declined both, noting that juvenile courts will have
jurisdiction over Johnson only until he turns 18. Gaither said he
has sent about ``10 kids'' to Glen Mills, which costs about $96 a
day, compared to about $120 per day to keep a youth in a Texas
Youth Commission facility, he said. Texas will pay for his
Pennsylvania stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen Mills is run just like West Point is run,'' he said. ``It
is very discipline-oriented. It costs somewhat less to go to Glen
Mills, but the issue is what's best for the community. I'm
satisfied that this is best for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Ward, 16, a friend of Prickett, said: ``I don't feel that
his sentence was strong enough. It should have been a lot stronger.
Jason is blind for life and (Johnson) is going to a military school
for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Prickett's mother, Beverly, who testified that her son's medical
bills are up to about $20,000, asked the judge to sentence Johnson
to a Texas Youth Commission facility. She said she cannot pay the
bills and she has applied for help from a victim's assistance fund.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was a glimpse into the haves and have-nots of suburban
teen life in Richardson, a suburb of Dallas. Friends of Prickett,
with unusual hairstyles, multiple earrings and baggy clothes, held
an uneasy truce in the halls of the Henry Wade Juvenile Justice
Center with Johnson's well-dressed upper-middle-class friends from
J.J. Pearce High School.
</P>
<P>
   The defense made much of Prickett's status as a ninth-grade
dropout and leader of a street gang called Third Power, contending
Prickett precipitated the fight with threats against Johnson and
other Pearce students. But the prosecution made no apologies for
Prickett's lifestyle. Prosecutor Denise Hale said Prickett ``is
what he is'' but did not deserve what he got. Prickett lost sight
in his left eye and has impaired vision in his right, injuries that
prosecutors said went far beyond self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson testified Wednesday that he gouged Prickett's eyes in
self-defense during a confrontation between gang members and Pearce
athletes in a Richardson field April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Prickett, who was not in court when the compromise was reached,
told his friends that he is upset with the outcome and didn't want
to talk, said another friend, Shawn Smith, 20.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were pleased that Johnson pleaded guilty but were
disappointed with the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like he was a candidate for TYC,'' said Charlie Martin,
another prosecutor. ``It was vicious. But at least he won't be in
Richardson, Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen's father, Jerry Johnson, said he is relieved that the
matter was resolved, but said his son should have been cleared of
the charges. He said his son was trying to protect others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected Danny to be released. He was righting everything
that they were doing. He stood up for his friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Johnson said his son regrets that Prickett was so badly
injured. ``He is sorry the boy was injured. He is not an
optometrist. He didn't know how much damage he did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors did not talk to the media, but Gaither said they told him
they were hung up over the issue of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some confusion over the testimony and who did what
and when,'' Gaither said. ``They were solidly entrenched, but they
were willing to work through it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, before last week's holiday break, jurors told the
judge they were deadlocked at 9-3. On Monday, it was a 10-2
deadlock, but notes to the judge never indicated which verdict the
majority favored. Gaither said he wouldn't reveal that either,
although defense attorneys speculated that the majority was in
favor of a finding of delinquent conduct, which is equivalent to a
guilty verdict in adult court.
</P>
<P>
   Gaither said that if he had declared a mistrial, he would have
rescheduled the trial for July 20. In a second trial, the
prosecution would have had an advantage because it would have seen
all the defense's case and bolstered its weaknesses, Gaither said.

2 IN L.A. TENTATIVELY LINKED TO N.Y. WOMAN'S DISAPPEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Utah)  (bl)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Officially, the disappearance of Irene Silverman, an
82-year-old Upper East Side socialite, was still listed Tuesday as
a missing-persons case, an incident without motive, witness or
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an elderly female who has disappeared very
mysteriously,'' said Police Inspector Joseph Reznick.
</P>
<P>
   But as a team of detectives fanned out across the city, seeking
traces of Ms. Silverman, they also sought clues about two people
already in custody _ an unlikely mother-son team of con artists who
have been convicted of crimes as varied as stealing fur coats and
enslaving Mexican immigrants and who are wanted for questioning in
a Los Angeles murder.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Silverman, whose home decor was inspired in part by the
palace of Versailles, was last seen walking through her town house
in a nightgown Sunday morning and was reported missing by her
housekeeping staff Sunday night. Monday evening, after finding
blood outside Ms. Silverman's apartment, police released a sketch
of a tenant who was wanted for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   A New York City detective who happened to see the sketch on
television immediately alerted Manhattan investigators to a
fortunate coincidence: the man, known to Ms. Silverman as Manny
Guerin and to investigators as Kenneth Kimes, was already behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes, 23, had been arrested along with his 63-year-old mother,
Sante Kimes, on an unrelated federal warrant Sunday evening that
accused him of passing a bad $14,000 check in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   That discovery led to more intriguing clues. The Kimeses were
carrying Ms. Silverman's identification at the time of their
arrest, said an investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity,
and detectives said their curiosity was further piqued by a call
from Los Angeles police, who want to question the Kimeses in
connection with the murder of a man whose body was found in a
garbage bin in Venice on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Los Angeles Police Department declined to
identify the victim or discuss the case. But another law
enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
victim was a Granada Hills, Calif., man whose home was sold after
his death and the proceeds apparently stolen.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department, Officer
Eduardo Funes, said police were investigating the death of the man,
David Kazdin, 63, but said there were no suspects and declined to
discuss details of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Another law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Kazdin's home was sold after his death and the
proceeds were apparently stolen, and detectives want to question
the Kimeses to determine whether they have information about the
case.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan on East 65th Street on Tuesday, neighbors,
employees and acquaintances said they were worried for Ms.
Silverman's safety, and they related incidents and anecdotes from a
unique and intriguing life.
</P>
<P>
   Professor James Schenton, who befriended Ms. Silverman 20 years
ago when she took his history course at Columbia University,
described her as a sprightly octogenarian with a storied past and
passionate interest in the arts and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   She was a former dancer with the corps de ballet at Radio City
Music Hall in the early 1930s, who gave up the stage for society
and later married. Her husband Samuel died in 1973, and friends
said that in her later years, Ms. Silverman had channeled her
enthusiasm toward her multi-million dollar limestone home, half a
block from Central Park, which she had divided into lavish
apartments and operated as a sort of boarding house for the
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a woman who has a fascinating propensity to become
involved in all kinds of things,'' Schenton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after Ms. Silverman's disappearance, police
immediately grew concerned, because it was unheard of for her to
leave the home unaccompanied by a member of her domestic staff,
Reznick said. A search of the property brought another chilling
discovery, an investigator said _ a trail of blood on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator said one servant told detectives that Ms.
Silverman had recently argued with Kimes and had threatened to
evict him from his $6,000-a-month apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He apparently kept watching her, and that rubbed her the wrong
way,'' said an investigator. ``She had very high standards and
occasionally threw people out if they weren't up to snuff. And the
thought of a guest keeping her under surveillance, that was just
too much.''

Michael Roth, curator of the Library of Congress exhibition called

``But it will show that Freud was responding to issues that remain

CAREER OF CNN STAR HANGS IN THE BALANCE OVER A REPUDIATED REPORT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one man can make a network. But if it is possible for one man
to give a network a recognizable face, Peter Arnett did that for
Cable News Network when American bombs began to fall on Baghdad in
1991. It was his kind of story _ ``action'' is the word he comes
back to, over an over, in describing what has been the signature of
his career for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not an action story that left his career in limbo and
put him on a plane Tuesday for Atlanta for a meeting Wednesday with
network executives. That meeting could determine how long CNN's
most famous face will remain with the network.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, for Arnett's colleagues, goes to the heart of the
inner workings of television news _ how much responsibility he, as
a correspondent, bears for a now-repudiated CNN report that the
U.S. military used nerve gas in a secret 1970 mission, ``Operation
Tailwind,'' to kill American defectors in Laos.
</P>
<P>
   For CNN executives, the issue has further complexity. They are
struggling with how to stanch a public relations wound and how to
deal with perhaps their most visible star and an important asset.
The network lacks the stable of heavyweight stars of CBS, NBC and
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   There is internal dissension, too. At a meeting on Monday, some
CNN staff members who questioned Arnett's role were asking,
according to one who spoke on the condition of anonymity, why he
should be treated differently.
</P>
<P>
   If the lead producer on the report, April Oliver, can be
dismissed, if her immediate supervisor, senior producer Jack Smith,
can be dismissed, if the resignation of senior executive producer
Pamela Hill can be accepted, what about the correspondent?
</P>
<P>
   The issue, for Arnett, is how much responsibility he can be
expected to take for the investigative work of others, when he
spends his days shuttling between war zones, media conferences at
which he represents the network and magazine reports like the
repudiated one on the June 7 premiere broadcast of ``Newsstand: CNN
and Time.'' His byline appeared with Ms. Smith's on a version of
the report in Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be terribly disappointed if they saw that I had failed
the network in my relationship with this story,'' Arnett said in a
telephone interview. ``I hope they don't saddle me with the blame.
I think it's a cop-out.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnett said he would not argue that his long service under fire
should save his 17-year career with the network, but rather that
``they should judge me on the totality of this story and my
involvement in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to bring up Baghdad,'' he said, in a reference
to the moment that, for many, made his reputation as a television
journalist and marked the end of any derisive references to CNN as
``Chicken Noodle News.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnett's reputation, however, was made earlier. After graduating
from high school in Bluff, New Zealand, the correspondent _ with
the body of a fireplug and the face slightly skewed by an early
career as a boxer _ began to irritate the people he covered early
on.
</P>
<P>
   He was thrown out of Indonesia by its government in the early
1960s. He went from there to Vietnam, where he became one of the
best known reporters in that conflict, winning a Pulitzer Prize in
1966 while working for The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   It was his Vietnam experience that made him an obvious candidate
to work on the Tailwind piece.
</P>
<P>
   It was not his idea, Arnett said, to lean so heavily on the work
of others. ``In Central America, in Baghdad during the Gulf war,
even today on action stories like covering the Baghdad crisis,'' he
said, ``we do have some producers and some assistants. But on
deadline you write the story. You're directly involved in getting
the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any choice but to be fully conversant with what
we're covering.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arnett said _ and a network spokesman confirmed _ that
although news magazine programs like CNN's ``Impact'' and its
successor, ``Newsstand,'' had some correspondents permanently
assigned to them, other correspondents, like Arnett and Christiane
Amanpour, would be called in to narrate reports developed by
others.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliver and Smith, well-regarded veterans in the business
before this episode, have defended their reporting repeatedly since
their dismissals. Both say they believe that the network caved in
to pressure from former top officials, like Henry Kissinger and
Gen. Colin Powell. Network executives deny this.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett said he first heard about Ms. Oliver's research into
allegations of nerve gas use in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was traveling a lot,'' he said. ``She would call and say,
`I've got a great one. Do you want to be a part of it?' '' The two
had earlier worked on a report about units devoted to secret
operations in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was part of the team,'' he said, ``but I didn't have
supervising authority.''
</P>
<P>
   There were signs that something might be amiss. He did three
interviews, including a crucial one with a pilot who flew the
mission but said he dropped tear gas, not nerve gas. Arnett said he
flew to San Diego from Oregon to do the interview with the pilot,
Art Bishop, then immediately flew to a conference in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-second clip of the interview was cut at the last minute in
Atlanta because of time constraints. When asked if he had pushed to
have this interview included in the final script, he said: ``They
gave me the list. I asked these questions. The producers took the
tape and I was gone. I was the face.''
</P>
<P>
   But the implication that on-air correspondents are simply
mouthpieces for hardworking producers who do all the work is
infuriating to some of Arnett's colleagues. ``There are a hell of a
lot of correspondents in this business who do our own work, who ask
questions, who read, who talk to people who conduct interviews,''
said Ralph Begleiter, CNN's world affairs correspondent and, like
Arnett, a 17-year veteran of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing I could do to halt the onward rush of this
story,'' Arnett said. He did say he had called an old source, a man
who was once the second in command to Gen. Creighton Abrams in
Vietnam, and was told that the officer had never heard of the use
of nerve gas, or of Operation Tailwind. He passed this information
on to the producers, he said. But he did not use it to question the
basic premise of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Any questions Arnett raised _ and he did not say he had raised
many _ brought crisp, sure answers. ``They had the goods,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And at another point, he noted, ``Obviously, I felt like an
idiot that I'd been in Vietnam for years and never heard about
this. But I'm also willing to believe that there are things that
happened in Vietnam that we didn't know.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BENITO, Texas _ A young man armed with military assault
rifles killed the mother and sister of a woman with whom he had had
a lover's quarrel and then fatally shot two Border Patrol agents
pursuing him here Tuesday, law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials say the shootings in the lower Rio Grande valley,
in which a local sheriff's deputy was seriously wounded,
illustrates the growing risks Border Patrol agents face in a
territory transformed into a combat zone as officers pursue drug
smugglers, as well as people moving illegal immigrants across the
border.
</P>
<P>
   The ranks of the Border Patrol have swollen to fight these
crimes and now its agents are also summoned to aid the local
authorities in other situations.
</P>
<P>
   A suspect, Ernest Moore, 24, was also wounded in the shootout
and died early Tuesday night at Valley Baptist Medical Center in
Harlingen, the police said, adding that he was the son of a police
officer in Harlingen, a larger city northwest of San Benito.
</P>
<P>
   The two agents, one of whom is the first woman slain while on
duty, were the third and fourth to die this year. Eighty-one agents
have died in the Border Patrol's 74-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Meissner, the head of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the agency that oversees the Border Patrol, said at a
local news conference that she had attended a service for another
slain agent only a month ago. ``I had hoped that it would be the
last,'' she said. ``Now, so soon, two more courageous and heroic
officers have fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   While the greatest risk to agents usually lies along the border,
they are increasingly being summoned by local police and sheriff's
departments.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:20 Tuesday morning, deputies in the Cameron County
Sheriff's Department investigated a report that shots had been
fired in Rio Hondo, another Harlingen suburb. Sheriff Omar Lucio
said they had found Margarita Flores, 53, and a daughter, Delia
Morin, dead, and a son seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio said later that Moore had been looking for another
daughter. Leaving behind what deputies said was an AK-47 assault
rifle, he fled before dawn in a white pickup truck, in which he was
seen with two other men. The authorities are investigating whether
those men also played a role in the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the Border Patrol, deputies spotted the pickup
about a half-hour later in the driveway of a San Benito house the
police said Moore had shared with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies and agents were searching the home and then the
nearby cornfields, when they heard rifle fire. Ricardo Salinas, 24,
a Border Patrol trainee, and Susan Rodriguez, a 28-year-old agent,
were fatally wounded. Officers later found an AR-15, a civilian
version of the M-16 assault rifle used by the military.
</P>
<P>
   After taking Moore into custody, more than 150 law-enforcement
officials combed the fields and dusty roads for the two men spotted
in the truck. In 100-degree heat, assault teams from several
federal, state and local agencies advanced in helmets and flak
jackets, as a helicopter whirred overhead. Even the police from
Edinburg, a nearby city, rumbled up in an armored vehicle.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By early afternoon, the officers began wrapping up their search,
saying they had scoured the area and would pursue other leads.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded deputy, Raul Rodriguez, 32, was in critical
condition at Valley Baptist Medical Center. The wounded brother,
Danny Morin, 22, was reported to be in serious condition at the
same hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said that they had no reason believe
that drugs were involved in the disputes, and that the suspect
appeared to have no criminal record.

<P>
   PHOENIX _ No one knows why Samuel Ambrose was beaten bloody and
left to die on the floor of his condominium near Metrocenter.
</P>
<P>
   But the man convicted of his murder says he wants to die for the
crime, even though prosecutors didn't seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   And when the man's own defense attorney formally requested the
death penalty _ then pledged to seek it again on appeal _ the case
sparked an uproar in the Phoenix area legal community that is still
bubbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit in here 24 hours a day, seven days a week, having
nothing to think about but it,'' Douglas Alan Smith, 34, said
during a jail interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the rest of my life, every time I look in the mirror, this
will confront me.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, his public defender, Jamie McAlister, asked a
judge to do just that: sentence Smith to death even though county
prosecutors never sought it.
</P>
<P>
   Even chain-gang inmates waiting in the courtroom looked
dumbstruck when McAlister asked Superior Court Judge Bernard
Dougherty to give Smith death.
</P>
<P>
   In her motion, McAlister called Ambrose's 1995 death
``especially cruel,'' stating, ``He was beaten over and over with
anything defendant could grab _ bottles, vases, what-have-you.
Samuel sustained a torrential rain of blows, 60-plus by one count.
. . . He had time to feel fear and terror.''
</P>
<P>
   McAlister told the judge that she was suffering a ``great deal
of schizophrenia'' over the motion, but that it was her duty to
follow her client's instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty promptly denied the request.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as promptly, McAlister abruptly reversed course and
asked for a hearing to argue for her client to receive the shortest
sentence possible.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, McAlister and co-counsel Robert Ellig were
removed from the case by the head of the public defender's office,
Dean Trebesch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of criminal-defense attorneys arguing for the death
penalty is disturbing and unacceptable to me and the vast majority
of, if not all, public defenders and other criminal-defense
attorneys,'' Trebesch said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   McAlister left the office to go into private practice. Within a
matter of days, she was reassigned to Smith's case upon his request
over another public defender's protests that her representation
could later be considered ``ineffective'' by an appeals judge.
</P>
<P>
   Although she plans to argue for a light sentence, McAlister said
she will continue to fight for her client's death if that is his
wish when the case is appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Which has angered many in the Phoenix area legal community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the old-fashioned way where the county attorney asks
for the death penalty,'' said one defense attorney, who asked to
remain unidentified.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Baich of the federal public defender's office, said, ``I
think it's outrageous that a lawyer would ask for the death penalty
when the state did not believe it was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others _ including county prosecutor Juan Martinez _
called the request akin to allowing a client to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Mr. Smith has insisted that he be put to death, the
state is not in the business of assisting in suicide,'' Martinez
said.
</P>
<P>
   McAlister, dismayed by her peers' reaction, said she and Smith
agonized over the decision for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the death penalty is an abomination. I think it is a
sin before God. Period,'' McAlister said. But Smith should be
allowed to die, she said, because of his mental disability _ a type
of epilepsy that causes the brain to go into seizures and
deteriorate without state-of-the-art treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Being deaf and disabled herself, McAlister said she was able to
relate to Smith's fears about deteriorating into a ``vegetative
state'' in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Because Smith can become violent when he is having a seizure, he
likely will end up in solitary confinement permanently, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he would rather die than ``end up living with a bunch
of monkeys throwing feces at each other'' in a prison mental ward.
</P>
<P>
   His death also might bring solace to Ambrose's surviving
relatives who asked for the death penalty, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost feel like I know them,'' Smith said about Ambrose's
widow and family. ``I sit in bed at night and think about them. I
can't wait until my sentencing. I finally get to open my mouth and
say I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was suffering from seizures in July 1995 and can
remember only being picked up by Ambrose, going home with him and
being locked in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show that after the slaying, Smith turned off the
stove in Ambrose's kitchen, grabbed Ambrose's wallet and keys and
took off in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Smith in Flagstaff after stopping him in
Ambrose's car and noticing blood on his clothing. Checking
Ambrose's address, police found the bloody body of the 68-year-old
man and evidence of a struggle. Smith was convicted of first-degree
murder; a motive has never been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Smith does not believe he killed Ambrose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not voluntarily end up in this mess,'' he said. ``I'm a
victim, too. It makes me very sick. I'm very ashamed.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Another Democrat backs Gov. Bush for new term
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON, Texas _ Another day, another Democratic endorsement for
Republican Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In an event becoming almost as routine as polls showing him as a
top presidential contender, Bush on Tuesday collected high praise
from a high-profile Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Former Houston Mayor Bob Lanier said backing Bush over
Democratic challenger Garry Mauro in the November general election
was an easy call, and should be for all voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Garry Mauro and I like him fine,'' Lanier said at a
news conference in his 34th-floor Houston penthouse apartment.
``But my goodness, in the private sector if you had a chief
executive who makes you lots of money and was well-regarded and
business was going great, you wouldn't seek to replace him with a
fellow who was going to learn the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanier also said he would support Democrats John Sharp, who is
running against Rick Perry for lieutenant governor, and Paul Hobby,
who faces Carole Rylander in the comptroller race.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mauro was unimpressed by Lanier's endorsement of
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most popular Democrat in Texas _ Ann Richards _ and the
biggest Democrat in the world _ President Bill Clinton _ are
working to elect Garry Mauro governor, and that type of support is
significant,'' said Joe Cutbirth.
</P>
<P>
   But Lanier said he is confident that, as a Democrat for Bush, he
is in the majority among top Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, collecting and showing off Democratic endorsements like
trophies, said Lanier's support would have a ``huge effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Bob would have been leader of this city for a long, long
time if people had their way,'' Bush said of Lanier, who remained
overwhelmingly popular here last year when he hit the six-year term
limit and could not seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Lanier, who backed Richards in 1990 when she defeated Republican
Clayton Williams for governor, declined to say whether he voted for
Bush or Richards in 1994. As a mayor elected in nonpartisan
balloting, Lanier did not endorse candidates while he was in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Lanier is lining up this time with Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, House
Appropriations Chairman Rob Junell of San Angelo and scores of
lesser-known Democrats who have jumped the party ship. Mauro, polls
show, could be headed for a November disaster of Titanic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro also has been stung by the refusal of Sharp and Hobby to
back his candidacy. A long-time player in state politics, Lanier
was appointed to the state highway commission in 1983 by then-Gov.
Mark White, a Democrat he backed. In 1980, however, Lanier
supported Republican Ronald Reagan's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Lanier said, he backed Democratic candidates about 75
percent of the time. Lanier has raised money for Clinton's
presidential campaigns, but noted that he has also hosted events
for the Republican National Committee. His goal, Lanier said, was
to ``develop sort of an ambidextrous ability'' while mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Elyse Lanier, the ex-mayor's wife, was a Richards appointee on
the University of Houston System Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   The Lanier endorsement comes a week before Bush and Mauro file
campaign finance reports expected to show that Mauro also is
getting buried in the money chase. Bush said he has about $14
million on hand. Cutbirth declined to say how much Mauro has. The
challenger spent heavily on spring TV ads that failed to move poll
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Texas Poll showed Bush with a 53-point lead.

MOST POTENTIAL JURORS FAMILIAR WITH CADET CASE (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By ROBERT THARP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ Even 250 miles from the site of Adrianne
Jones' slaying more than two years ago, the story lingers in the
minds of many residents.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 57 prospective jurors for David Graham's capital murder
trial interviewed Tuesday, seven indicated that they are unfamiliar
with the charges against the former Air Force Academy cadet.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Comal County residents questioned individually by
Tarrant County District Judge Don Leonard, who moved the case here
in an effort to diminish the effect of heavy publicity, said they
know basic details about Jones' slaying and the arrests of Graham
and his former fiancee Diane Zamora. Two of the panelists said they
had watched a TV docudrama based on the case, and one said he had
read one of the two books written about the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they had formed opinions about Graham's guilt or
innocence but said that they could set their feelings aside and
rule solely on the evidence. Eighteen of the 57 were excused from
jury service because they said they could not be impartial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember there were two people with outstanding capabilities
that I wished I'd had,'' said one prospective juror who was excused
from service. ``Something went dreadfully wrong, and no one won in
my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Dan Cogdell said jurors who are familiar with
the case can still be valuable for the defense if they are
``free-thinkers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a bunch of lambs being led to slaughter by what
the press thinks they ought to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 21, watched and took notes during the questioning, which
lasted three to five minutes for each panelist. Cogdell said Graham
was observing the potential jurors' reactions toward him, such as
looking away, frowning or staring.
</P>
<P>
   During a break in the questioning, Cogdell lashed out at news
media accounts that the case against Graham is ``open and shut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense quite simply is that David Graham is not guilty,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant District Attorney Mike Parrish said Cogdell is
``trying to get sympathy'' and perhaps create jurors with a
``hidden agenda'' partial to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are that David Graham confessed to murdering
Adrianne Jones,'' Parrish said. ``That's evidence that the jury
will hear next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said he's optimistic that a pool of 114 jurors can be
assembled by the end of the week. The potential jurors completed an
83-page questionnaire that will be analyzed by prosecutors and
defense attorneys before final jury selection takes place Monday
and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Leonard will consider several pretrial hearings,
including a prosecution motion to use a written confession that
Zamora made to investigators before her arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Another motion would allow Graham's mother, Janice Graham, to be
taken off the prosecution witness list in exchange for her pretrial
testimony identifying her son's handwriting in 13 letters to Zamora
after their arrests. If Janice Graham remains on the witness list,
she will not be allowed to watch the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Graham faces life in prison if convicted of the December 1995
abduction and slaying of Jones, a Mansfield High School sophomore
who was found beaten and shot to death along a rural southwest
Grand Prairie road. Zamora was convicted in February for her role
in the slaying and is serving a life sentence.

 &HT;    Ohioans shortchanged by Medicare, report says
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Only two states are shortchanging low-income
Medicare beneficiaries more money in federal subsidies than Ohio,
according to data released Tuesday by Families USA, a non-partisan
health advocacy group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Close to two-thirds of Ohioans entitled to have their Medicare
premiums paid for are not receiving such assistance, the
organization's report said.
</P>
<P>
   The result, said Families USA, is more than 233,000 Ohioans are
losing between $122 million and $138 million a year in unpaid funds
from the state-administered programs.
</P>
<P>
   That money is coming from seniors and disabled people who can
least afford it, the report said. They're unnecessarily paying
Medicare premiums of $1,051.20 a year for low-income couples and
$525.60 for those living alone. The singles' premiums are scheduled
to rise 140 percent to $1,268.40 in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the problems are resolved, the federal government will
take an even larger bite out of the meager Social Security checks
of widows and widowers in years to come,'' said Families USA
executive director Ron Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   Congress established programs in 1988 and 1990 to pay Medicare
premiums for beneficiaries with incomes below 120 percent of the
poverty level, and also to pay deductibles and co-payments for
those living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But the Social Security Administration is withholding about $2
billion a year nationally from people entitled to these subsidies
but apparently unaware of them, according to Families USA's
estimate. President Clinton responded with plans to reach the
affected 3.3 million to 3.9 million Americans through a publicity
campaign involving mass mailings, field workers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that eligible beneficiaries either aren't finding
out about the programs or are reluctant to pursue them, said
spokesmen for Ohio's departments of Human Services and Aging. The
subsidies are paid only to those who apply for them through the
state's Medicaid program in the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage people not to feel any type of negative view
about these programs,'' said Randy Leffler of the Department of
Aging, which operates a joint program with the Department of
Insurance in every county to educate Ohio seniors about insurance
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the report said only Texas and Florida have more
eligible beneficiaries missing out on the subsidies, and only six
states are leaving out higher percentages of eligible people.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, Families USA estimated that 59 percent to 67 percent of
those eligible for the benefits aren't receiving them. The figures
range from 9 percent to 80 percent among individual states, with
the national estimate at 42 percent to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ohioans can find out if they're eligible for federal funding of
their Medicare premiums by answering a questionnaire through the
Department of Aging's Benefits Eligibility Screening Service. Ohio
has the only Internet-based screening service at
www.state.oh.us/age/, and the service also can be called toll-free
at (800) 282-1206.
</P>
<P>
   The departments of Aging and Insurance manage the Ohio Senior
Health Insurance Information Program to answer questions about
insurance issues. Professionals answer the toll-free number at
(800) 686-1578 and volunteers in every county meet with groups or
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Applications for the federal Medicare subsidies are available at
each county's Department of Human Services, listed in the
blue-bordered government pages of the phone book.

PLAINTIFF'S LAWYER CALLS BRAWLEY'S ADVISERS SELF-PROMOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ In the final argument before the jurors
consider the Tawana Brawley defamation case, the lawyer for the
plaintiff called Ms. Brawley's three advisers evil men and
self-promoters who destroyed the lives of others for their own
advancement.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, William Stanton, delivered a staccato summation of
an hour and 20 minutes that seemed intended to return the focus to
what he said was the simple injustice done to his client, Steven
Pagones.
</P>
<P>
   Distortions, falsehoods and calculated efforts at
self-promotion, Stanton said, were behind the advisers' accusations
a decade ago that Pagones, an assistant district attorney who is
white, was guilty of the rape and kidnapping of a black teen-ager.
Stanton urged the jurors to cut through the ``baloney'' and find
against the advisers, the Rev. Al Sharpton, C. Vernon Mason and
Alton H. Maddox Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men are dangerous,'' Stanton said. ``They are bad. They
are evil. Don't let them get away with this.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the advisers used a tactic that reminded him of Josef
Goebbels, the Nazi propagandist who he said believed that ``if you
repeat the lie often enough, people will believe it.'' He added,
``Don't fall into that trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations are expected to begin Wednesday after the judge
gives legal instructions to the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton spoke in terse phrases, reminding the jurors that Ms.
Brawley, at the center of the case, never testified. ``Where's
Tawana?'' he asked. ``Why isn't she here?''
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly returned to the theme of trying to hold the
advisers accountable. That was the theme Pagones set by filing the
civil suit after a grand jury discredited Ms. Brawley's account a
decade ago. ``These people have no conscience,'' Stanton said.
</P>
<P>
   After more than seven months in the courtroom, Stanton said he
was keeping his remarks short because ``there's nothing more to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   But his summation seemed to rekindle the passions of a case that
had dulled over the months. The courtroom, which is usually packed
with black supporters of the advisers, was dominated Tuesday by
rows of white supporters of Pagones.
</P>
<P>
   As Stanton finished, the Pagones supporters burst into applause,
which was quickly squelched by the court officers. But the outburst
seemed to be a declaration that Pagones supporters were back in the
courtroom, which has sometimes seemed to be the advisers' domain.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Dutchess County Courthouse, as well, there was a
return of the impassioned rhetoric that marked the case when it
began in November. Sharpton's lawyer, Michael Hardy, said it was
not the defendants but Ms. Brawley's attackers who had relied on
Nazi tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Mason said Stanton's remarks amounted to a racist appeal to the
Dutchess County jurors. Two of the six jurors are black and four
are white. ``Why don't you just use the N word, you racist, because
you did it impliedly,'' Mason said to the assembled reporters, with
his supporters cheering him on.
</P>
<P>
   By keeping his remarks in court so short, Stanton seemed to
assume that the jurors were already persuaded by the evidence and
needed little more than a framework.
</P>
<P>
   He spent much of his time ridiculing the defense's dark
suggestions that Pagones was part of a large conspiracy including,
as Maddox put it in his summation, ``fat cats from New York City.''
Who else was in the conspiracy, Stanton asked with a sneer, the
Queen of England? The Rockefellers? ``Who else do you want to throw
in, Ronald McDonald?''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton gave short shrift to the defense assertion that the
advisers were civil rights leaders who needed the freedom to speak
openly about official misdeeds. ``This case is not about
Mississippi in 1955,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton picked out a few facts to quarrel with the defense
interpretation. Maddox, for example, said on Monday that the lack
of any powder residue on the hands of Harry Crist Jr., a friend of
Pagones who died of a gunshot wound, proved that Crist had not
committed suicide, as a grand jury found in 1988, but had been
murdered. Maddox said Pagones was the murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrably false, said Stanton on Tuesday. The grand jury
report included evidence that there was powder residue. Crist
committed suicide, Stanton said, and the advisers had committed a
new injustice by subjecting Crist's family to new speculation about
his death during the trial in State Supreme Court here.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, Stanton left the tangle of the case's
facts alone, instead drawing the sorts of expansive conclusions
about the advisers that have attracted widespread attention to the
case.
</P>
<P>
   They ignored information, he said, that would have raised
questions about their assertion that Pagones had been part of a
group of white men who attacked Ms. Brawley. ``We don't want to
know that,'' Stanton suggested was their approach.
</P>
<P>
   Because the case is civil, only five of the six jurors will have
to agree on any of the more than 100 questions they are to be asked
on a verdict sheet. The jurors are not to be sequestered.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict sheet will include sections for each of the 22
separate statements that Pagones says defamed him. For each
statement, the jurors will have to answer questions like whether
that statement was defamatory and whether it was made with
knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for whether it
was true.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, over defense objections, the jurors will be asked
whether the advisers acted in a conspiracy. If the jurors answer
yes, each of the advisers could be held liable for the statements
of the others.
</P>
<P>
   While the advisers have portrayed themselves as separate
entities, Stanton worked Tuesday to cast them as a single unit,
sharing responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three of them were joined at the hip,'' Stanton said.
``They were self-promoters. They didn't care who they stepped on or
stepped over. They destroyed lives for their own
self-advancement.'' &QL;

Tuesday for two young agents cut down at the beginning of what were
expected to be long, successful careers.
</P>
<P>
   The agents _ Susan Lynn Rodriguez, 28, and Ricardo Guillermo
Salinas, 24 _ were felled by gunfire from an assault rifle fired by
a suspect in a double homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, immigration authorities said, was the first woman
Border Patrol agent killed in the line of duty and the daughter of
a former high-ranking Border Patrol official. Salinas was a
well-regarded rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were two of our finest. This is a very dark day in the
history of the Border Patrol, the Border Patrol family,'' said Joe
Garza, chief of the McAllen Border Patrol sector, at an afternoon
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   It was in January that Garza swore in Salinas as a new agent,
one of hundreds of trainees assigned to the Texas-Mexico border
under an enhanced border control effort known as Operation Rio
Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Garza and other officials were telling reporters about
Salinas _ and the fiancee and family in San Antonio the young agent
had left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Salinas has been with us for less than a year, just out
of the academy,'' Garza said. ``He was going to take his 10-month
probationary examination on Thursday, so he was a relatively new
agent. He was doing well, and was very well thought of.''
</P>
<P>
   Garza noted that Rodriguez, who joined the Border Patrol in
1992, was married to an immigration officer stationed in Harlingen
and the couple had a 1-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an outstanding young agent, one of our training
officers,'' Garza said. She is the daughter of retired Deputy
Border Patrol Chief Steve Williams of the El Paso Sector.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Meissner, the commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service who also attended the press conference,
remarked on those connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from a strong immigration law enforcement family, this
saddens us even more because she is the first woman Border Patrol
agent we have lost in the line of duty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas and Rodriguez became the third and fourth Border Patrol
agents killed in the line of duty this year, and the first in Texas
since Jan. 19, 1996, when Senior Agent Jefferson Barr was shot to
death by a suspected drug trafficker near Eagle Pass. In all, 81
agents have died in action since the border force was established
in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said Border Patrol agents are part of the local
communities, and are frequently called to help local law
enforcement authorities, as they were Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men and women of the United States Border Patrol put their
lives on the line every day and, as this tragedy illustrates, not
just protecting the nation's borders,'' the INS chief said. ``We
will miss agents Salinas and Rodriguez, they were a part of the INS
family. We will remember them for the dedication and hard work here
in Harlingen, and the other places they served.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Meissner attended a memorial service for an agent
shot in the head by a suspected drug smuggler just north of the
Mexican border near Nogales, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped it would also be the last,'' Meissner said
Tuesday. ``Now, so soon, two more courageous and heroic officers
have fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   Garza said his agents frequently find themselves in
confrontations with well-armed assailants along the border and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of crime in the Valley, and the Valley is
growing very rapidly,'' said Garza. ``We constantly encounter
people who are armed, heavily armed. This is just another example
of how quickly a tragedy like this can occur.''

AD COLUMN: YOUTH-INFLUENCED ANTI-SMOKING EFFORT DOESN'T MINCE
WORDS 
</HEADLINE>

 By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next phase of an ambitious anti-smoking campaign, created
for and in part by teen-agers, is as audacious as any tobacco
company advertisement featuring anthropomorphic animals, fit and
healthy athletes or models who flash sparkling white teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising, by Crispin Porter &AMP; Bogusky in Miami, is the
continuation of an effort formally known as the Florida Pilot
Program on Tobacco Control, which is being financed by the tobacco
industry under a settlement reached last year with Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The new installments of the television, print, outdoor and
interactive campaign, carrying over a theme centered on ``truth,''
boldly assert that youngsters can resist the imagery that sells
cigarettes if they understand the mendacious ploys being foisted
upon them by the denizens of Tobacco Road, Madison Avenue and
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message that smoking is bad for you has been out there for
so long, but it's obvious that message is not getting through,''
said Jared Perez, 17, who will be a senior at Palm Harbor
University High School in Palm Harbor, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is the marketing director for Students Working Against
Tobacco, or SWAT, a youth advocacy group that was formed by
teen-age Floridians to funnel advice and ideas about the campaign
to Crispin Porter and the Florida Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to use our ads to pitch a different message,'' Perez
said, ``not that smoking is bad for you _ because we know that _
but that the industry is manipulating and targeting youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Other states sponsoring anti-tobacco ads include Arizona,
California, Massachusetts and New York. Interestingly, as the money
spent to advertise cigarettes declines, the money spent on
counter-campaigns _ often financed by tobacco settlements or
cigarette taxes _ is increasing. So agencies may decide they would
rather switch than fight.
</P>
<P>
   The states' ads have met with widely divergent responses. The
California campaign, for instance, has been praised for such
unconventional approaches as showing limp cigarettes to symbolize
impotence caused by smoking. A recent campaign from New York, by
contrast, has been roundly criticized as conventional and
formulaic; one spot shows Attorney General Dennis Vacco, who is up
for re-election, standing next to an American flag and lecturing to
the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking campaigns need to be ``guerrilla advertising, a
little under the radar,'' and ``using the kids' language,'' said
Alex Bogusky, partner, vice chairman and creative director at
Crispin Porter.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is ``part of a review board to which we send the ads in
rough form,'' he added, ``and then we get suggestions back to help
us avoid any large missteps.''
</P>
<P>
   One important lesson ``from working with the kids,'' Bogusky
said, is that ``the subject is a big deal to them, but the ads
don't have to be heavy; they should be kept light and fun.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea behind a new television commercial about the
perils of secondhand smoke that offers a dead-on parody of the
opening credits and theme song of ``The Brady Bunch'' sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   The tune has been rewritten to tell ``a story of a chain-smoking
lady'' and a man ``who was busy with three packs of his own.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple's children are shown coughing and wincing as their
parents puff away. At the end of the spot, a nurse who looks like
Alice, the Brady housekeeper, places an oxygen mask over one boy's
face.
</P>
<P>
   Print ads and posters take a similar tack in tackling other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost,'' the headline on one ad reads. ``Goes by the name of
`Conscience.''' The text continues: ``Belongs to advertising agency
executive. It was lost while he was creating tobacco ads.'' At the
bottom of the ad are names and telephone numbers of agencies with
tobacco accounts; they are designed to resemble the tear-off strips
usually found on ads on bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 agencies cited include the Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago,
Gyro Worldwide in Philadelphia and Mezzina/Brown in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A second ad, carrying the headline ``Help wanted,'' says:
``Looking for talented Hollywood screenwriters. Most possess the
ability to create cool, sexy or rebellious characters without
copping out by having them smoke.'' That ad has at the bottom, also
in the style of tear-off strips, the telephone number of the Motion
Picture Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   And a poster for shopping mall kiosks mimics the rating advisory
in a movie ad. But it presents an imaginary rating of ``L'' for
``Lazy'': ``The makers of this film couldn't think of a way to make
their characters seem cool or sexy or rebellious. So instead
they'll just smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mitchell, marketing director for the pilot program at the
Florida Department of Health in Tallahassee, said: ``No one who
smokes as much as an action character in a movie could run a mile
in six minutes. He'd get three feet and then he'd cough.''
</P>
<P>
   The television commercial is running on stations in Florida. The
print ads are scheduled to appear in the August and September
issues of national magazines such as Rolling Stone, Seventeen,
Spin, Teen and YM. The kiosk poster is appearing in malls
throughout Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the current part of the campaign is more than
$5.1 million; the total campaign, which began in April, has an
initial budget of $25 million.

FUND-RAISER IS INDICTED IN TAX CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A California Democratic fund-raiser who has already
been charged with disguising illegal campaign contributions to
President Clinton's re-election campaign was indicted Tuesday on
federal tax charges.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Hsia, a Los Angeles immigration consultant, was accused of
failing to file a 1994 tax return, underreporting her income in
1995 and 1996 and helping to file a fraudulent corporate tax return
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hsia, (pronounced shaw) a naturalized U.S. citizen born in
Taiwan, has been free on bond pending her trial on the political
fund-raising indictment that was returned in February. Since then,
she has traveled to China with judicial approval to work with
clients seeking help in immigrating to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The tax charges were filed in a federal court in California, but
will be prosecuted by the Justice Department's campaign-finance
team, which operates from Washington under the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hsai's lawyer, Nancy Luque, said Tuesday that the charges
were false and represented an effort by federal prosecutors to
pressure Ms. Hsia into pleading guilty to the campaign-finance
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This indictment is totally bogus,'' said Ms. Luque. ``These
are technical violations with no loss to the government. I thought
we'd seen the last of IRS cases brought for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, a grand jury here charged Ms. Hsia with disguising
$65,000 in illegal campaign contributions from a California
Buddhist temple to the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign and other
politicians between 1993 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Hsi Lai Temple, in the Los Angeles suburb of Hacienda
Heights, Calif., was named as an unindicted co-conspirator. Three
temple nuns told a Senate committee last fall that the temple
illegally reimbursed donors after an April 1996 fund-raiser
attended by Vice President Al Gore. Gore has said he did not know
it was a fund-raising event, but a Senate panel said he should have
known.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's charges appear unrelated to Ms. Hsia's political
activities. The charge of failing to file a 1994 federal income-tax
return carries a maximum penalty of a year in prison and a $100,000
fine. Each of the three charges involving false returns carries a
maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accuses Ms. Hsia of underreporting her income in
1995 and 1996 and underreporting the gross receipts of her
immigration consulting business, Hsia &AMP; Associates Inc., in
Arcadia, Calif., on its corporate tax return. Ms. Hsia incorporated
the company and owned 20 percent of its stock, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said that Ms. Hsia had a gross income of more
than $8,050 in 1994, but did not file a tax return. In addition,
the indictment said that Ms. Hsia reported total income of $16,314
for 1995 and total income of $10,026 for 1996 although she made
more than that each year. The government did not disclose how much
income it believes she actually earned during the years in
question.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also said Hsia &AMP; Associates reported 1995 gross
receipts of $240,189, although Hsia knew its receipts were
``substantially greater.'' The documents filed Tuesday did not
provide any government estimate of Ms. Hsia's actual income. &QL;

VW AGREES TO COMPENSATE WARTIME SLAVE LABORERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs 3rd graf to note many of the ex-slave workers are dead;
adds 4 new grafs at end)  (bl) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In an abrupt reversal from a decision a
month ago, Volkswagen AG has agreed to set up a fund to compensate
workers who were forced into slave labor in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse announcement three weeks after the company had been
threatened with a lawsuit, Volkswagen said that its decision was
``in recognition of the historical and moral obligations'' to those
who were forced to work in its factories under the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen has acknowledged that it used slave labor. According
to a history financed by the company two years ago, it employed
15,000 slave laborers in the war. By now, many of them are dead.
</P>
<P>
   But Volkswagen executives had until Tuesday insisted that
compensating victims was a government responsibility, because the
company had been acting on government orders. When a group that
represents former workers from Hungary threatened last month to
sue, a Volkswagen spokesman said that any direct compensation by
the company was simply ``not possible'' under current law.
</P>
<P>
   Though reversing its position, the Volkswagen board declined to
say how much it would pay or whether it would make payments to
victims' families. The company said it would announce details in
September.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those who campaigned against the company declared victory
Tuesday. ``It is an unconditional surrender,'' said Klaus von
Muenchhausen, a lecturer at the University of Bremen who began to
campaign last month on behalf of 30 former factory workers.
</P>
<P>
   Von Muenchhausen, who threatened to sue Volkswagen if it did not
offer compensation by the end of July, said the company's decision
was quite likely to strengthen those who pursued similar complaints
against other German wartime companies.
</P>
<P>
   Von Muenchhausen said the workers he represented had been Jewish
teen-agers who were captured in Hungary and taken to Auschwitz.
From there they were sent by rail to Volkswagen factories in
Wolfsburg. Today the former workers all live in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen apparently came under pressure from the government of
Lower Saxony, whose governor is Gerhard Schroeder, the Social
Democratic candidate for German chancellor. The government of Lower
Saxony owns 20 percent of Volkswagen, and Schroeder is on the
supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Von Muenchhausen said state officials had pressed Volkswagen
because they did not want to be dragged into a unpopular court
battle, particularly in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen may have had its reasons for choosing to sidestep an
ugly controversy. The company has just completed the acquisition of
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the British manufacturer of luxury cars,
and it is acquiring Lambourghini, the Italian sports car company.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Volkswagen's new flash and success in the
marketplace, some local political leaders were unwilling to stick
out their necks to defend the wartime record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is paradoxical to buy the world's luxury brands and on the
other side be so miserly,'' the head of the Lower Saxony
parliament, Rolf Wernstedt, said several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Slave labor provided a vital element of the German war machine.
Some estimates put the number of slave laborers as high as 10
million, chiefly from Russia, Poland, the Netherlands, Norway and
other countries, and many were Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen made rockets, military vehicles and other materiel.
Some big German companies of the early postwar years like I.G.
Farben and Krupp made payments to slave laborers, sometimes under
pressure from contractors overseas.
</P>
<P>
   A recent court decision opened the way for foreigners to claim
reparations. In March, a weapons maker, Diehl Stiftung &AMP; Co.,
reached an out-of-court settlement to pay $700 a month to former
slave laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Von Muenchhausen said he was asking for more than $2,000 a month
from Volkswagen. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fretting about how much the cost of college will have soared by
the time your kids are ready for four years in ivory-tower bliss?
</P>
<P>
   One increasingly appealing strategy is a prepaid-tuition plan,
which lets parents lock in tuition money now _ regardless of what
the costs are by the time Junior matriculates.
</P>
<P>
   The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 made many attractive adjustments
to these plans, so this is a good time to look them over.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, prepaid-tuition plans and tuition-savings plans are
state-run programs that allow families to pay a fixed sum of money
(in either monthly installments or a lump sum) for as many as 17 or
so years before a child is ready to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   With a prepaid plan, the money is guaranteed to cover tuition
later, regardless of the cost when a student is ready to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   With a savings plan, money is socked away now for college, but
if tuition has increased beyond what the plan anticipates, the
parents or student are responsible for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   With both plans, the money grows tax-deferred and, upon
withdrawal, is taxed at the student's income rate, not the
parents'. Since most students will fall into the 15 percent
bracket, there can be considerable tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   The key advantage to a prepaid-tuition plan is that parents lock
in a specific tuition price for a state school at the time they
begin investing, regardless of how much tuition increases for
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the amount parents pay is based on the age of their
child and the projected year of college entrance. Parents also
select how many years of college they would like to save for and
for which type of school, but there is no need to specify a school
at the time investing begins.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of a newborn in Mississippi, for example, can pay a lump
sum of $9,141 now or make 216 payments of $80 a month to cover four
years at a state university that begin in the year 2015 (based on
the average tuition and fees at public colleges, with a factor for
inflation).
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of the lump-sum payment is that you start earning
interest on the entire amount right away.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 1998, 14 states had prepaid-tuition plans, and five
had savings plans. According to the College Savings Plans Network,
in Lexington, Ky., another 20 states intend to launch programs this
year.
</P>
<P>
   To find out more about a specific plan, call CSPN
(606-244-8175), or visit its Web site at www.csg.org/cspn.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the 1997 tax bill, states are now allowed to accept
money to prepay room and board in addition to tuition. The law also
loosened the rules for which type of school and for which state the
money can be used.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the plans were once good only for publicly
supported schools in the state in which the family lived, many
states now allow families to use the money at any accredited two-
or four-year school _ public or private _ in the country.
</P>
<P>
   If Junior ends up at Harvard or Bennington, you'll simply have
to pay the difference in cost. Grandparents are also allowed to set
up a plan in the state where their grandchild lives.
</P>
<P>
   The savings plan will prove too conservative for some investors
_ the plans shoot for just a 5 percent to 6 percent gain, though
the tax advantages shouldn't be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid-tuition plans offer more of a hedge against runaway
inflation. ``States monitor tuitions and make sure earnings keep up
with tuition inflation,'' says Kathy Tyson, research manager at
CSPN. ``With savings plans, states try to earn as much money as
they can on them, but there's no guarantee they'll keep up with
inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   If your child decides to pursue his or her acting dream and
forgo a college education together, there may be a considerable
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, such as Wisconsin, charge a 1 percent fee to
withdraw money from the plan. Others, such as Florida, will return
your money but without the interest it accrued _ a considerable
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Just one more reason to insist that the little ones finish their
education. &QL;

<P>
   Fretting about how much the cost of college will have soared by
the time your kids are ready for four years in ivory-tower bliss?
</P>
<P>
   One increasingly appealing strategy is a prepaid-tuition plan,
which lets parents lock in tuition money now _ regardless of what
the costs are by the time Junior matriculates.
</P>
<P>
   The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 made many attractive adjustments
to these plans, so this is a good time to look them over.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, prepaid-tuition plans and tuition-savings plans are
state-run programs that allow families to pay a fixed sum of money
(in either monthly installments or a lump sum) for as many as 17 or
so years before a child is ready to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   With a prepaid plan, the money is guaranteed to cover tuition
later, regardless of the cost when a student is ready to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   With a savings plan, money is socked away now for college, but
if tuition has increased beyond what the plan anticipates, the
parents or student are responsible for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   With both plans, the money grows tax-deferred and, upon
withdrawal, is taxed at the student's income rate, not the
parents'. Since most students will fall into the 15 percent
bracket, there can be considerable tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   The key advantage to a prepaid-tuition plan is that parents lock
in a specific tuition price for a state school at the time they
begin investing, regardless of how much tuition increases for
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the amount parents pay is based on the age of their
child and the projected year of college entrance. Parents also
select how many years of college they would like to save for and
for which type of school, but there is no need to specify a school
at the time investing begins.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of a newborn in Mississippi, for example, can pay a lump
sum of $9,141 now or make 216 payments of $80 a month to cover four
years at a state university that begin in the year 2015 (based on
the average tuition and fees at public colleges, with a factor for
inflation).
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of the lump-sum payment is that you start earning
interest on the entire amount right away.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 1998, 14 states had prepaid-tuition plans, and five
had savings plans. According to the College Savings Plans Network,
in Lexington, Ky., another 20 states intend to launch programs this
year.
</P>
<P>
   To find out more about a specific plan, call CSPN
(606-244-8175), or visit its Web site at www.csg.org/cspn.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the 1997 tax bill, states are now allowed to accept
money to prepay room and board in addition to tuition. The law also
loosened the rules for which type of school and for which state the
money can be used.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the plans were once good only for publicly
supported schools in the state in which the family lived, many
states now allow families to use the money at any accredited two-
or four-year school _ public or private _ in the country.
</P>
<P>
   If Junior ends up at Harvard or Bennington, you'll simply have
to pay the difference in cost. Grandparents are also allowed to set
up a plan in the state where their grandchild lives.
</P>
<P>
   The savings plan will prove too conservative for some investors
_ the plans shoot for just a 5 percent to 6 percent gain, though
the tax advantages shouldn't be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid-tuition plans offer more of a hedge against runaway
inflation. ``States monitor tuitions and make sure earnings keep up
with tuition inflation,'' says Kathy Tyson, research manager at
CSPN. ``With savings plans, states try to earn as much money as
they can on them, but there's no guarantee they'll keep up with
inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   If your child decides to pursue his or her acting dream and
forgo a college education together, there may be a considerable
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, such as Wisconsin, charge a 1 percent fee to
withdraw money from the plan. Others, such as Florida, will return
your money but without the interest it accrued _ a considerable
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Just one more reason to insist that the little ones finish their
education. &QL;

 By PETER L. BERNSTEIN  
 c.1998 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When an argument misses the whole point, the result is likely to
be irrelevant, confusing, or just plain wrong. Much of the debate
about the future of Social Security misses the whole point.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not whether Social Security is fundamentally sound
or fundamentally bankrupt, or whether privatizing Social Security
with some kind of giant 401(k) plan would provide us with a more
comfortable old age. At its core, the risk we face has nothing at
all to do with what we now call financial planning.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement has become a central issue of national concern
because the number of retirees is going to grow more rapidly than
the number of people of working age, and that problem intensifies
with the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   The great uncertainty, then, is whether the economy will be able
to produce sufficient goods and services to support the retired
baby boomers in the style to which they have been accustomed, while
still leaving enough for the younger working members of society to
live in the style to which they would like to become accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the real risk is in the productivity of our economy.
</P>
<P>
   All the money in the world piled up in retirement funds will be
worthless unless the economy can provide the stuff we will want to
buy.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing accomplished by money flowing in and out of
retirement funds is the determination of who gets what, not how
much is available. Money is the ticket to the show but does not
determine what the show will be.
</P>
<P>
   The important point is that more people can enjoy the show if we
can increase the number of available seats. That is why I emphasize
that the standard of living the aging baby boomers can enjoy will
ultimately depend far more on the productivity of the nation than
on the financial arrangements we concoct to fund their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Then how do the financial arrangements enter the picture?
Consider the process by which we finance our everyday spending or
pay off our creditors.
</P>
<P>
   If we are regularly writing checks to pay our bills, or drawing
cash by check or from the ATM, we must be sure to have some way of
replenishing our bank accounts. Money has to come in from
somewhere, or we will go belly-up.
</P>
<P>
   People with jobs bank the wages and salaries they receive from
their employers. People who do not work must look elsewhere to
raise cash _ welfare, monthly pension-fund receipts, a friendly
relative, interest and dividends on investments, or the proceeds
from liquidating assets that have been accumulated over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Note that every one of those sources depends in turn on payments
from somewhere else. For example, the government will not mail
welfare benefits or pay the interest on its bonds unless citizens
pay their taxes or buy the bonds issued to cover budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend payments on equities won't be forthcoming unless
corporations can find a market for their output. The accumulated
assets cannot be liquidated if there are no buyers for those
assets.
</P>
<P>
   This illuminates the true function of retirement funds. A
retirement fund owns stocks and bonds and other investments but
cannot itself finance the spending of the retirees unless the fund
has money in the bank first.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, no matter how much shares of stock and no matter
how many bonds the fund owns, no pensions can be paid unless the
bonds and stocks are paying an income or unless the market is
receptive to buying the investments the fund chooses to liquidate.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, then, retirement benefits are financed from outside
the fund rather than by the fund itself. Retirement funds are
merely conduits; they determine who gets what, not how much is
available _ which means that the true function of the assets in
these funds is to serve as collateral to secure the claims of
future retirees on future production.
</P>
<P>
   But no restructuring of Social Security, no privatization or
other type of reform, will do the trick unless the economy is
prosperous _ unless taxpayers have jobs, corporations can pay
dividends, borrowers can meet their interest payments when due, and
the capital markets are buoyant.

<P>
   When an argument misses the whole point, the result is likely to
be irrelevant, confusing, or just plain wrong. Much of the debate
about the future of Social Security misses the whole point.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not whether Social Security is fundamentally sound
or fundamentally bankrupt, or whether privatizing Social Security
with some kind of giant 401(k) plan would provide us with a more
comfortable old age. At its core, the risk we face has nothing at
all to do with what we now call financial planning.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement has become a central issue of national concern
because the number of retirees is going to grow more rapidly than
the number of people of working age, and that problem intensifies
with the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   The great uncertainty, then, is whether the economy will be able
to produce sufficient goods and services to support the retired
baby boomers in the style to which they have been accustomed, while
still leaving enough for the younger working members of society to
live in the style to which they would like to become accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the real risk is in the productivity of our economy.
</P>
<P>
   All the money in the world piled up in retirement funds will be
worthless unless the economy can provide the stuff we will want to
buy.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing accomplished by money flowing in and out of
retirement funds is the determination of who gets what, not how
much is available. Money is the ticket to the show but does not
determine what the show will be.
</P>
<P>
   The important point is that more people can enjoy the show if we
can increase the number of available seats. That is why I emphasize
that the standard of living the aging baby boomers can enjoy will
ultimately depend far more on the productivity of the nation than
on the financial arrangements we concoct to fund their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Then how do the financial arrangements enter the picture?
Consider the process by which we finance our everyday spending or
pay off our creditors.
</P>
<P>
   If we are regularly writing checks to pay our bills, or drawing
cash by check or from the ATM, we must be sure to have some way of
replenishing our bank accounts. Money has to come in from
somewhere, or we will go belly-up.
</P>
<P>
   People with jobs bank the wages and salaries they receive from
their employers. People who do not work must look elsewhere to
raise cash _ welfare, monthly pension-fund receipts, a friendly
relative, interest and dividends on investments, or the proceeds
from liquidating assets that have been accumulated over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Note that every one of those sources depends in turn on payments
from somewhere else. For example, the government will not mail
welfare benefits or pay the interest on its bonds unless citizens
pay their taxes or buy the bonds issued to cover budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend payments on equities won't be forthcoming unless
corporations can find a market for their output. The accumulated
assets cannot be liquidated if there are no buyers for those
assets.
</P>
<P>
   This illuminates the true function of retirement funds. A
retirement fund owns stocks and bonds and other investments but
cannot itself finance the spending of the retirees unless the fund
has money in the bank first.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, no matter how much shares of stock and no matter
how many bonds the fund owns, no pensions can be paid unless the
bonds and stocks are paying an income or unless the market is
receptive to buying the investments the fund chooses to liquidate.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, then, retirement benefits are financed from outside
the fund rather than by the fund itself. Retirement funds are
merely conduits; they determine who gets what, not how much is
available _ which means that the true function of the assets in
these funds is to serve as collateral to secure the claims of
future retirees on future production.
</P>
<P>
   But no restructuring of Social Security, no privatization or
other type of reform, will do the trick unless the economy is
prosperous _ unless taxpayers have jobs, corporations can pay
dividends, borrowers can meet their interest payments when due, and
the capital markets are buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   The people who miss the whole point worry that the Social
Security trust fund will be depleted before most of the baby
boomers can claim their rightful share. Yes, if that dread moment
were ever to arrive, the collateral held to secure the promise of
Social Security would no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean society would necessarily let its senior
citizens starve; it means only that their needs could not be met by

<TEXT>
<P>
   Will it be different this year? Will both the market and the
Wall Street strategists who backed it last year run out of gas in
the second half of 1998? Don't count on that yet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the market was scaling then unprecedented
heights, the optimistic voices on Wall Street loudly proclaimed,
``This time it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical comparisons that showed the market to be way
overvalued were irrelevant, announced the group, led by Abby Joseph
Cohen of Goldman Sachs. American corporations had become the most
efficient in the world, inflation was vanquished, and interest
rates were on their way down, Cohen and the others pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disturbingly low dividend yields and disturbingly high
price-to-earnings rations, the stock market is cheap, they
preached.
</P>
<P>
   And they were right. For the 12 months ended April 24, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index had appreciated a stunning 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But now, by all historical measures, the stock market is even
more stunningly overvalued. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 trades at
slightly less than 28 times trailing earnings _ a year ago many
experts called the market expensive when the price-to-earnings
ratio ran past 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average trades at 64 times dividends _
the yield on these stocks is a Japan-like 1.55 percent. A year ago
it seemed the height of insanity when the index traded at 55 times
dividends and the yield was 1.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. In late April, with 381 of the 500 companies in
the S&AMP;P 500 having reported their earnings for the first quarter of
1998, the average year-to-year growth rate was a meager 3.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what could possibly be left of the ``This time it's
different'' case? The case now rests almost completely on continued
low inflation and continued declines in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Steve Slifer, chief U.S. economist for Lehman
Brothers, believes that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond will
fall to 5.25 percent in 1998 from about 6 percent now and then dip
even lower, to 5 percent, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation remains under control and bond yields fall, stock
prices will rise. In interest rates fall, the yield on the S&AMP;P 500
won't look quite so piddling.
</P>
<P>
   Slower earnings growth will be less of a problem, too, since
investors will compare any increase with the decline in bond
yields. A lower inflation rate will also make each dollar of
earnings more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, equities will become an even more attractive
alternative to bonds and other types of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Delightful to ponder, but just how likely is that? After all,
interest rates have already dropped awfully low, haven't they?
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury was 7.1 percent in April 1997.
The April 1998 rate of 6 percent represents a 15 percent drop in
one year. Isn't it just wishful thinking to imagine that interest
rates will fall another 17 percent by the end of 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, if you look at real interest rates instead of the
nominal figures that everybody follows. The real interest rate
takes inflation into account _ it's what the interest from a bond
or other interest-paying asset is actually worth after you subtract
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April, for example, the nominal interest rate on a
30-year Treasury bond was 6 percent. The real rate was 6 percent
minus the current inflation rate of 1.4 percent, or 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates have actually climbed during the market's
recent seven-and-a-half-year expansion. In October 1990, the long
bond yielded almost 9 percent. But with inflation for the year at a
little over 6 percent, the real yield was just under 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as the fall in interest rates has been since 1990
(from 9 percent to 6 percent), the decline in inflation has been
even steeper (from 6.1 percent to the current 1.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates, consequently, haven't fallen at all.
They've actually risen, to 4.6 percent from 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of real rates, argues the ``This time it's
different'' crowd, is a result of scars from the horrendous
inflation of the 1970s and 1980s. Prices rose at an annual rate of
6.3 percent from 1971 to the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Once investors finally admit that inflation is under control for
the foreseeable future, real interest rates and thus nominal rates
will fall. Getting to a 5 percent nominal yield on the 30-year bond
is easy if inflation stays at 1.4 percent and the real rate falls
to a still-hefty 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another way to interpret the stubbornly
high real rate of interest. Investors may be justifiably skeptical
about the death of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in 30-year bonds may be demanding a 4.6 percent real
yield because they believe that the Federal Reserve won't hold the
line, that Congress won't be able to resist spending its way back
into deficit, that the current collapse of global inflation is a
temporary respite before Asian consumers renew their demand for
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run investors ignore those arguments at their
peril. But these dangers don't look capable of derailing the ``This
time it's different'' case in the short run _ for the rest of 1998
and into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office is now projecting just an $8
billion surplus for the fiscal year ending in October _ a small
enough margin to discourage Congress from letting loose its most
expansive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is perched on the verge of another and deeper recession.
That will slow Asia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is unlikely to tighten dramatically.
Chairman Alan Greenspan knows that increasing U.S. interest rates
will create bigger problems in Asia, and he vividly remembers the
last time the Federal Reserve set off a financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the ``This time it's different'' crowd still seems
to be betting the winning hand. In that way, at least, this time
it's the same. &QL;

 &HT;    Beanie Babies the real star attraction at All-Star game
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ To heck with the All-Star paraphernalia Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Fans that came through the turnstiles at Coors Field wanted
Beanie Babies, a giveaway that got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball decided to give away ``Glory,'' the red,
white and blue All-American Beanie Baby from the Ty Collection. It
was a gift from the owners and the players association, a gesture
the two had never done together before. Ty made only 100,000 pieces
with close to 60,000 being given away at the game.
</P>
<P>
   But numerous Beanie Baby addicts showed up outside the park to
try to buy them, and the negotiating began. They had signs telling
what they would give up for them. Some were offering as much as
$150.
</P>
<P>
   One buyer ran down a fan and said, ``Give you $75.''
</P>
<P>
   Said the seller, ``Oh, yeah, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   The players also received Beanie Babies, and one was overheard
to say, ``This is the best thing I can bring home.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves arms
</P>
<P>
   With Greg Maddux on the mound Tuesday, it marked the ninth start
for a Braves pitcher in the midsummer classic, matching the
Cardinals, Phillies and Reds for third most of any team.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sixth start for a Braves pitcher in the last eight
years. Tom Glavine was on the mound in 1991 and '92, John Smoltz in
1996 and Maddux in 1994, '97 and this year.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Spahn had the starting assignment in 1949, '58 and '61.
Maddux is the 13th pitcher to start consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star bits
</P>
<P>
   David Wells became the first pitcher to throw a perfect game and
start an All-Star Game in the same season. ... Is there a true
rivalry between the leagues when it comes to the All-Star Game?
``It's fun, and that is really the way you approach it,'' said
11-time All-Star Frank Robinson. ``You enjoy meeting players from
the other league, talking and joking with them. Then when the game
starts, you get serious.'' ... Jay Leno-imitator Arsenio Hall was
doing interviews for the Tonight Show and put a container in Kenny
Lofton's locker labeled ``Viagra.'' It got a laugh from everyone,
even the cranky Lofton. ... Through the break, major-league
attendance is up 2.8 percent over last year at this time. ... The
media and players continue to pull farther and farther fapart.
Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr., a late addition to the home run derby
after the fans booed him in batting practice, took a shot at Rocky
Mountain News columnist Bob Kravitz: ``Now I'm a spoiled brat, a
punk, and I don't think I deserve that. I'm a villain. All because
of what some guy in Denver wrote about me.'' ... This is the first
year a city has hosted an All-Star Game and won a Super Bowl in the
same calender year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Will it be different this year? Will both the market and the
Wall Street strategists who backed it last year run out of gas in
the second half of 1998? Don't count on that yet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the market was scaling then unprecedented
heights, the optimistic voices on Wall Street loudly proclaimed,
``This time it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical comparisons that showed the market to be way
overvalued were irrelevant, announced the group, led by Abby Joseph
Cohen of Goldman Sachs. American corporations had become the most
efficient in the world, inflation was vanquished, and interest
rates were on their way down, Cohen and the others pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disturbingly low dividend yields and disturbingly high
price-to-earnings rations, the stock market is cheap, they
preached.
</P>
<P>
   And they were right. For the 12 months ended April 24, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index had appreciated a stunning 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But now, by all historical measures, the stock market is even
more stunningly overvalued. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 trades at
slightly less than 28 times trailing earnings _ a year ago many
experts called the market expensive when the price-to-earnings
ratio ran past 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average trades at 64 times dividends _
the yield on these stocks is a Japan-like 1.55 percent. A year ago
it seemed the height of insanity when the index traded at 55 times
dividends and the yield was 1.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. In late April, with 381 of the 500 companies in
the S&AMP;P 500 having reported their earnings for the first quarter of
1998, the average year-to-year growth rate was a meager 3.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what could possibly be left of the ``This time it's
different'' case? The case now rests almost completely on continued
low inflation and continued declines in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Steve Slifer, chief U.S. economist for Lehman
Brothers, believes that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond will
fall to 5.25 percent in 1998 from about 6 percent now and then dip
even lower, to 5 percent, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation remains under control and bond yields fall, stock
prices will rise. In interest rates fall, the yield on the S&AMP;P 500
won't look quite so piddling.
</P>
<P>
   Slower earnings growth will be less of a problem, too, since
investors will compare any increase with the decline in bond
yields. A lower inflation rate will also make each dollar of
earnings more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, equities will become an even more attractive
alternative to bonds and other types of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Delightful to ponder, but just how likely is that? After all,
interest rates have already dropped awfully low, haven't they?
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury was 7.1 percent in April 1997.
The April 1998 rate of 6 percent represents a 15 percent drop in
one year. Isn't it just wishful thinking to imagine that interest
rates will fall another 17 percent by the end of 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, if you look at real interest rates instead of the
nominal figures that everybody follows. The real interest rate
takes inflation into account _ it's what the interest from a bond
or other interest-paying asset is actually worth after you subtract
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April, for example, the nominal interest rate on a
30-year Treasury bond was 6 percent. The real rate was 6 percent
minus the current inflation rate of 1.4 percent, or 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates have actually climbed during the market's
recent seven-and-a-half-year expansion. In October 1990, the long
bond yielded almost 9 percent. But with inflation for the year at a
little over 6 percent, the real yield was just under 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as the fall in interest rates has been since 1990
(from 9 percent to 6 percent), the decline in inflation has been
even steeper (from 6.1 percent to the current 1.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates, consequently, haven't fallen at all.
They've actually risen, to 4.6 percent from 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of real rates, argues the ``This time it's
different'' crowd, is a result of scars from the horrendous
inflation of the 1970s and 1980s. Prices rose at an annual rate of
6.3 percent from 1971 to the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Once investors finally admit that inflation is under control for
the foreseeable future, real interest rates and thus nominal rates
will fall. Getting to a 5 percent nominal yield on the 30-year bond
is easy if inflation stays at 1.4 percent and the real rate falls
to a still-hefty 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another way to interpret the stubbornly
high real rate of interest. Investors may be justifiably skeptical
about the death of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in 30-year bonds may be demanding a 4.6 percent real
yield because they believe that the Federal Reserve won't hold the
line, that Congress won't be able to resist spending its way back
into deficit, that the current collapse of global inflation is a
temporary respite before Asian consumers renew their demand for
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run investors ignore those arguments at their
peril. But these dangers don't look capable of derailing the ``This
time it's different'' case in the short run _ for the rest of 1998
and into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office is now projecting just an $8
billion surplus for the fiscal year ending in October _ a small
enough margin to discourage Congress from letting loose its most
expansive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is perched on the verge of another and deeper recession.
That will slow Asia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is unlikely to tighten dramatically.
Chairman Alan Greenspan knows that increasing U.S. interest rates
will create bigger problems in Asia, and he vividly remembers the
last time the Federal Reserve set off a financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the ``This time it's different'' crowd still seems
to be betting the winning hand. In that way, at least, this time
it's the same. &QL;

CASE OF ACCUSED GENERAL LEADS ARMY TO ALTER RETIREMENT PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army said Tuesday that it had revised its
procedures for allowing generals to retire, a result of a
controversy over the deputy Army inspector general who was allowed
to retire quietly in February even though he was under
investigation for sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said that under the new
procedures, an Army general would be allowed to retire only after
there was ``full disclosure,'' to the highest reaches of the
service, ``of any problems or allegations that a person may be
facing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the changes were ordered last month by Army Secretary
Michael Walker as a result of the circumstances surrounding the
retirement of the deputy inspector general, Maj. Gen. David R.E.
Hale. Pentagon officials said the other armed services would
consider similar changes in their retirement policies for senior
officers.
</P>
<P>
   A Defense Department report given to members of Congress on
Monday said Hale had engaged in a pattern of ``inappropriate
behavior'' or adulterous affairs with the wives of four officers
under his command in a previous assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by the Pentagon's inspector general, found that Hale
had also ``sanctioned the misuse of government resources'' to pay
for international travel by one of the women and that he had lied
``in an effort to deceive others concerning his conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale, who has denied the accusations, was allowed to retire in
February even though other senior Army officials were reportedly
aware of some of the charges against him. In an interview earlier
this year with NBC News, the Army's chief of staff, Gen. Dennis
Reimer, acknowledged that he knew about some of the accusations
when he approved the retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Reimer declined to comment on the case
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But at a regular news conference at the Pentagon, Bacon offered
a spirited defense of the chief of staff, reminding reporters
repeatedly that ``Gen. Reimer's actions are not under review
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's under review,'' he said, ``are the Army's procedures
for dealing with retirement requests by general officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Defense Secretary William Cohen ``has complete
confidence in Gen. Reimer.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy surrounding Hale's retirement has led to
sentiment on Capitol Hill and among lawyers who specialize in
military justice that the Army has a double standard in which
senior officers accused of wrongdoing are treated with leniency
while the careers of accused enlisted personnel or junior officers
are destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Army, alleging 18 counts of sexual misconduct,
vigorously prosecuted its senior enlisted soldier, Sgt. Maj. Gene
McKinney, whose lawyers insisted that they knew of Army generals
who had been allowed to retire quietly rather than face trial on
similar charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the prosecution, the Army refused to grant
McKinney's request for retirement. He was convicted of only one
charge, of obstruction of justice, and was eventually allowed to
retire with full benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon denied that the Army had a double standard, and said this
would become clear once all the details about the case against Hale
were known.
</P>
<P>
   The Army announced last week that it was opening a criminal
investigation of Hale, 53. The accusations against him involve a
period from 1996 to 1997, when he was stationed in Turkey as deputy
commanding general for NATO land forces in southeastern Europe. &QL;

JUSTICE TAKES ITS SWEET TIME IN SON'S DEATH  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reynold Jordan waited three years to see his son
Trevor's killer convicted. During that vigil, he and his family
were frustrated by the knowledge that although two of them had seen
Patrick Stephens kill 19-year-old Trevor outside their Brooklyn
home, the gunman was living in the relative refuge of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan knew this because while he grew impatient with the pace
of the investigation in New York, he did a little digging of his
own. A friend who lived in one of the identical brick houses that
line the streets of his East Flatbush neighborhood gave him reports
on Stephens' whereabouts. He passed that information to
investigators, he said, only to have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the delay was caused by conflicting reports
from witnesses who had offered different accounts of whom they saw
at the scene. Nor did it help that during the course of the
investigation two detectives retired from the force and another
died. Finally, last December, the police arrested Stephens and
charged him with second-degree murder. After a brief trial in June,
he was convicted and sentenced last week to 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a Pentecostal minister who also drives a delivery truck
for The New York Times, feels a mixture of relief and restlessness
over how things took so long to be resolved. He was determined not
to be silenced by grief over the murder of his son, a young man
whose musical talent made him sort of a one-man band at his church
in Brooklyn. And he refused to allow his East Flatbush street,
where his family had been among the first black homeowners, to be
desecrated by violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man needs to protect his home,'' Jordan said. ``I am a
person who does not give up on anything. I know things don't happen
one-two-three. It took Moses 40 years to make it. Things take time.
But I say here, after all this evidence, my wife would not lie
about seeing Patrick shoot my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevor was shot a few days after arguing with some girls who
were friendly with Stephens, his father said. Trevor had tried to
break up a fight, Jordan said, and one girl had cut the young man.
They were arrested, he said, and one of them was jailed. She
returned to the neighborhood, where Jordan said she and friends
goaded his son and threatened his life.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor was killed on the morning of June 6, 1995, shot first as
he got out of his car, and then again, in the head, after
staggering down the street. His younger brother, Reynold, ran
outside when he heard the gunfire, and his mother also ran to the
window. Both said they saw the gunman, whom Reynold identified as
Stephens. Another witness, prosecutors said, identified someone
fitting a different description.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecutors made a judgment that these conflicts presented
a substantial barrier in the search for the truth,'' said Patrick
Clark, a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney. ``The
barrier was surmounted when we were able to obtain evidence from
the defendant.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after Trevor's death, the brother of one of Stephens'
friends was involved in the commission of a triple murder in a
nearby housing project. Jordan, looking for the slenderest of
threads on which to hang his hopes for justice, vowed he would go
on television to say the triple murder was preventable. By his
reasoning, the brother would have been deterred from committing any
crime had he known that justice was swift and unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan never went public with his complaint. Prosecutors and
investigators assured him they would move on the case, and they
did. When Stephens came to trial, the jury deliberated mere hours
before convicting him. ``It was an easy case,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was thinking about numbers the other day, and not the
kind Trevor used to play on the piano. He would have preferred the
death penalty for the killer, rather than the prison sentence that
was mandated by the law. The Bible, he said, talked about avenging
death with death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should not be in jail eating my tax dollars,'' he said.
``If you find 25 to life in the Bible, I'll accept that. That's why
we have chaos. Twenty-five to life is not God's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Another number offered consolation. The conviction came almost
three years to the day of Trevor's death. Jordan reached for a
well-worn book on numerology and the Bible, paging quickly to the
entry for the number three.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens to be good,'' he said. ``Three means completion.
Resurrection time.''

INVESTORS SNAPPING UP INTERNET-RELATED STOCKS, OFTEN SIGHT UNSEEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- And you thought the Beanie Babies craze was bad.
</P>
<P>
   With a fervor that would put the most aggressive doll collector
to shame, investors in recent weeks have scrambled to buy
Internet-related stocks, often with little regard for the
companies' earnings or prospects for long-term success.
</P>
<P>
   Typifying this rush toward online issues, investors this week
sent shares in Lycos, a developer of Internet search engine
software, up 26 percent to $99.56 on news that the company planned
a 2-for-1 stock split.
</P>
<P>
   While increasing a company's shares, a split has no impact on
underlying business and, therefore, should have little effect on
overall price. But not only did the announced split give Lycos a
major boost, competitor Excite enjoyed a collateral gain on mere
speculation that it would be the next Internet stock to split.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when lunacy starts, when investors start bidding up a
company 20 points based on a stock split alone,'' said Abhi Gami,
an Internet analyst at investment bank William Blair &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Like most in the Internet sector, Lycos and Excite both lost
ground Tuesday as the market took a breather. But since June 1,
Lycos is up 69 percent, Excite has gained 87 percent, America
Online is up 38 percent and online bookseller Amazon.com is ahead a
staggering 185 percent. While these companies are clearly market
leaders, a wider index of Internet-related stocks compiled by
Interactive Week magazine has risen 29 percent since June 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these stocks are on tremendous momentum,'' CIBC
Oppenheimer analyst Henry Blodget told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Industry trackers say a combination of fear, ignorance and greed
is fueling the rush toward Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors are partly to blame, arguably waiting
too long to get into Internet stocks and then, fearing they've
missed the boat, throwing large sums of money at a few key players.
Monday's surge, for example, was led by reports that two big mutual
fund companies, Fidelity Investments and PIMCO Advisors, would
heavily invest in Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   But mom-and-pop investors bear some responsibility, too. With
the growth of online trading through companies like E-Trade, DLJ
Direct and others, armchair investors have turned to what they know
when buying stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this,'' Gami said, ``has been on the backs of retail
investors -- people who aren't listening to financial advisers, but
are using Yahoo every day and reading in their newspaper about the
growth of the Internet. They're not focusing on fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   But even for the professional trader, valuing an Internet stock
can be tricky. With most companies lacking a track record of
earnings, old standards like price-to-earnings ratios prove nearly
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Super-investor Warren Buffett summed up the feelings of many
earlier this year when he challenged anyone to explain how to
accurately value an online firm. Buffett said that if he worked as
a business professor, he would ask that question of all his
students. Any who deigned to offer an answer, Buffett said, would
immediately flunk his class.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few of my colleagues on Wall Street are like that, saying,
we don't know how to value these firms, only it's a big market,
it's going to get bigger and you want to own these stocks,'' Gami
said.
</P>
<P>
   One way to judge the value of a company is to see what price
suitors have paid for its competitors. The Walt Disney Co. and
General Electric's NBC recently handed out substantial premiums for
stakes in Infoseek and Cnet, respectively. Analysts say speculation
that remaining Internet companies will enjoy similar gains if and
when they are bought by larger media players also has contributed
to the sector's inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Also, by entering the Internet market through acquisitions
rather than building their businesses from the ground up, Disney,
GE and others are securing spheres of influence in cyberspace, Gami
said, making it harder for newcomers to get established. The flip
side of that, he added, is that existing Internet companies share
that buffer against new competitors, making their stock arguably
more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, Gami said, the lather investors have found
themselves in over existing Internet companies probably won't abate
any time soon. Besides, he said, ``so many people have bought on
guesses and momentum that even after today's hiccup, there's still
a lot of guys out there who want to play with their positions. I
don't know if this is it.''

   In late 1994 a film was made that centered on me and my dark
whimsies about romance and heartbreak: ``The Sadness of Sex,'' from
my book of the same name. Here's my sorry tale of how this odd
independent movie was brought briefly to the screen _ and then to
the shelf, where it now sits, maybe for good. The story is my two
cents toward the updating of ``Candide'' that famously takes place
when a neophyte like me gets involved in the mad, bad world of
glamour-grabbing and economic hardball that is the film business.

   And it even stars Peta Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spalding Gray is like Woody Allen; you're like _ Fellini!''
cried Rupert Wainwright, a director of big-money television
commercials, that night in February 1994. He had just seen my
spoken-word act at the Luna Park club in Los Angeles and had been
inspired then and there to scratch notes for a performance movie.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I remember his effusions exactly. As a bicoastal bohemian _
a creature of Paris Review salons and hipster cabarets like Luna
Park and New York's Fez, plus a few minutes on ``MTV Unplugged'' _
here I was finally going to draw my ticket to the commercialization
of a career: my own ``Swimming to Cambodia.'' At 45, I made a
somewhat hoary Candide.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, for Rupert, in his mid-30s, the project was a
mad pure-hearted stroke to save his esthetic soul from Ballpark
Franks spots, Michael Jackson promos and ``Home Alone'' knockoffs.
Sure, he had a Grammy for his Hammer videos. But big, blond Rupert
was also an Oxford English-literature grad.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, I see that the pathos surrounding both our
ambitions wags the tale of ``The Sadness of Sex'' _ as do our
brands of hubris and naivete. Yet credit Rupert for a real miracle,
which is the one of getting our unconventionally unconventional
movie made at all.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we began so miraculously, before the farce to come last
year in Los Angeles, where the film had a short run, and the shock
in New York this spring, when to top everything I got called a
``smug lecher'' in a review, even though the film ended up not
opening at all.
</P>
<P>
   For two glorious, brutal weeks we shot in Toronto's chill fall
of '94. A Canadian commercials-production firm had put up half a
million dollars _ finally, in what I would come to know well as the
film business' puckish, yes-no, yes-no style. Under Rupert's lash I
took to the stage and hammed to the camera the stories he and I had
shaped into my surreal romantic history.
</P>
<P>
   Then on location for story re-enactments, I did a screen kiss,
heart pounding, with a young blond Australian ex-model. A couple of
years later, she would be widely known as the star of television's
``La Femme Nikita.'' To my shock _ that word again (the script
called for body doubles) _ Peta Wilson and I wound up in a
closed-set naked love scene. I had another shock, on another closed
set. Outdoors, dressed like Sam Spade, I climbed a shaky fire
ladder to fetch a runaway vagina up a tree . I shook, myself, in
fear and authorial jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This film makes `Swimming to Cambodia' look like an
infomercial,'' some bumptious soul cackled in post-production.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, indeed. Fully assembled, it was a cross between MTV and
``Aida,'' plus a splash of Hallmark cards. The photography was
sumptuous, with Peta blazing in negligee and angels' wings; an
editor from ``Natural Born Killers'' had kaleidoscoped my 90-minute
solo with live-action sequences, animation, video footage and photo
stills, and Rupert and the big-time music supervisor from
``J.F.K.'' had brought in a marquee-worthy original soundtrack for
a pittance.
</P>
<P>
   On screen, ``The Sadness of Sex'' was a grandiose, double
oddity: a quirky little art film cranked to a fare-the-well by
loving Hollywood-savvy hands. It blinded any grainy indie
stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   Was I, the author, happy with this extravagant movie version of
me and my whimsies? Today, I might hem about sensibilities. At the
time, happy wasn't the word. I was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   The film festivals weren't. All the majors and many minors _
including the hometown event in Toronto _ turned us down.
</P>
<P>
   Because we didn't look cheap enough, snorted one of our
distribution agents, trying to steady my distress. These agents had
been crucial in attracting financing. They were big in
feature-to-television rights (``Robocop'' the series); at selling
movies like ours, they were new.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the Hamptons festival threw open its arms. Rupert jetted
in from the Great Wall of China, where he was filming a commercial.
We had buzz, a journalist told me (though he hadn't seen the film).
A wisecracking 20-year-old from Brooklyn who showed part of a
rough-cut on video got one of the extra jury awards. The glories of
``The Sadness of Sex'' got no award _ and no distribution offer.
Rupert could have taken the boat.
</P>
<P>
   He and I sat our version of an indie post-mortem at a TriBeCa
restaurant, with Richard Harris, father of Peta's boyfriend. The
Irish film star stroked the tiny dog that was snuggling inside his
shirt, gave Rupert thumbs up and burred on about ``the great Joe
Losey.'' Misty-eyed, Rupert swore to me that whatever it took, he
would find us a distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Such grand moments fortified for a while, until the mixed review
in Variety. I barely registered ``original and often provocative,''
``excessive MTV-like style,'' ``commercial prospects skimpy'' and
``tech credits nothing short of stunning'' because I found myself
referred to, prominently, as Peta Wilson. First I had given up
credit, on screen, as an author (no mention of the underlying book,
only ``written by Barry Yourgrau and Rupert Wainwright'') _ and
now, in the industry trade paper, I had vanished as a performer!
Who'd God put in charge of movies, Don Rickles?
</P>
<P>
   But what's a few flying pies, when a whole cruel bakery awaits.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing came of Slamdance, the counter-festival to Sundance;
nothing of San Jose, where our sumptuous reels showed in wrong
order. Rupert perched away gallantly in distributors' offices with
a line about ``another `Il Postino.''' No one agreed, for months on
end.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't handling it well. I hadn't the nerves. I couldn't
understand: we had people who loved the film whenever we screened
it; why wouldn't somebody take a chance on us?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because, Barry,'' blurted David Lancaster, our senior
producer, ``it's still essentially 90 minutes of one guy talking.
Spalding Gray already had a name, from theater!'' I could feel my
Big Break slipping away. Frantic, I became someone who showed up at
dinner parties with a video clip.
</P>
<P>
   Enter, magically it seemed, Tara Releasing, with the original
Dutch thriller ``The Vanishing'' to its release credit. It was, of
course, a so-called ``micro-distributor.'' Its president mainly ran
a canoe-rental business.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sadness of Sex'' opened in its glory at a reputable Los
Angeles art house in the spring of '97, right after April Fools'
Day _ appropriately so, given the wincing Hollywood sendup of
independent-film ambitions to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Comic highlights: Rupert rushing the two of us, plus cell phone,
around Sunset Strip in his new Jag convertible, to Scotchtape our
homemade deluxe mini-posters onto mailboxes and lamps, beneath the
towering billboard of my ``Sadness'' lovemate, now far off being
Nikita to millions; literary bohemian movie star riding public
transport daily to Rupert's grand suite on the Sony lot, to
publicity-monger on the phones, which was all the author-performer
really did anymore.
</P>
<P>
   More comic highlights: director and movie star roaming
supermarket lots and pedestrian malls with Xeroxes of glowing
review (``a striking film'' _ The Los Angeles Times), getting
chased at high speed out of the Directors' Guild parking garage for
plastering windshields; anguished studio-lot conference calls to a
northern California canoe-rental shop, pleading for posters, ads,
promotional help; hangdog bohemian movie star (``ideal for the
camera'' _ The Los Angeles Times) and resolute linen-suited
millionaire director (``expands the boundaries of cinema'' _ New
Times) trudging side by side, night after night, from windshield to
windshield down the winding curbsides, the Hollywood sign looming
in the dark behind them.
</P>
<P>
   It was, altogether, a triumph of leafleting. ``Thought you guys
already had a distributor,'' someone wondered at the Los Angeles
Independent Film Festival, as we worked the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Tara drifted out of business, slowly and over dim months of
nothing, without announcement. ``The Sadness of Sex'' became ours
again. Lucky us. We had a jazzed-up one-man movie with a great Los
Angeles Time review, other fine blurbs _ and a feeble
couple-of-weeks run featuring a box-office gross to make any
distributor laugh and claw his hair.
</P>
<P>
   By now Rupert and I were the only ones with anything really to
gain from an opening in New York, instead of going right to video,
with Peta on the box cover. But Rupert and I would not give up on
the New York prestige, the attention. I was desperately sure we'd
find our audience here, where our incorrect blend of high gloss,
absurd poetic poignancies and young beauties in lingerie would be
treated as, say, a sexy European-style vision (more like Fellini,
perhaps, than ``Il Postino'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Not European,'' a Spanish journalist friend calculated subtly.
``Australian.''
</P>
<P>
   Rupert finagled a small self-release budget from our television
sales to eastern Europe (as part of a package with ``The Last Don''
mini-series). Screen space in Manhattan art houses is a jungle,
ruled by Miramax and other big beasts. But there we were, booked
prettily at a venerable showcase for quality unaffiliated
eccentricities and sexy European features. Peta agreed to fly in
for promotion. I went into hyping overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 13, a Friday (when else?), the polling came back from
our first press screening. ``Shocking'' won't do it. Few major
reviewers had attended, and none had tipped their hands, but the
viewers who did were united in a hiss of contempt. It was as if our
glam literary bauble had committed a cultural outrage of criminal
pretentiousness. The second screening was hardly better. We were
aghast.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert _ Rupert, who I would boast had switched agents to make
this film, who had never given up, who had kissed me at the end of
filming for giving him back his life _ Rupert, my champion, had
just been green-lighted for a big-budget Hollywood movie. It was
his first studio project since Disney's ``Blank Check'' in '94. I
could hear the struggle in his voice. Tortured conference calls
revealed his overriding concern: a bad review of ``The Sadness of
Sex'' must not appear in The New York Times on the Friday we
opened. He would not risk a review then _ at all.
</P>
<P>
   I heard myself sputtering heroic cliches: he was captain of our
ship (I'd just seen ``Titanic''); we were proud of what we'd done,
should ride it to its end and keep courage. Rupert informed me,
tautly, that those metaphors meant nothing to him.
</P>
<P>
   Finally he gave in to having ``The Sadness of Sex'' open _ on
the condition that no reviewer from The Times would see it in time
for Friday review. He canceled the remaining screenings (which he
had been paying for; he had already called off the premiere party),
and schemed a delay in screening cassettes going out to the news
media. Our publicity agent informed me that she was in the business
of publicizing films, not hiding them.
</P>
<P>
   I had always cleaved to Rupert, out of gratitude and because I
felt that he had the most power of us all and that his ambition
ultimately served mine. Now I found myself in a nightmare, joining
with the producer Lancaster, who was as appalled as I was, in not
interfering as screening cassettes went out as normal. I waited in
mutinous double-dread for the premiere.
</P>
<P>
   The theater, which knew none of this, trumped all this amateur
gore by canceling on us, four days to go. I heard the punch line as
I stood with The New Yorker in my hands: ``The Sadness of Sex'' was
featured in its film listings that week with ``The Big Lebowski.''
I was due on radio in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It was something about us not spending enough on ads and missing
a round of them. There was nothing we could do or say. Another film
was already in or slot. Imploring got us nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   So, ads had to be pulled frantically; desperate calls had to be
made, appealing that reviews be held _ especially to the weeklies,
which were already going to press. ``If a bad review shows up in a
weekly, no one else's going to book us; it's over!'' cried
Lancaster. What a setup line.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, on cue, The Village Voice finished its review in
this way: ``Yourgrau hogs the camera, oozing lecherous
self-satisfaction.'' On line, the headline was positively waggish:
``15 Short Films About a Smug Lecher.'' Some epitaph for a movie
about a man walking around sighing and being sad a lot.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, the owners of the theater, as distinct from
its booker, were chagrined to learn what had happened. They have
offered an open, certain date. But our release budget has been
pretty much exhausted. I'm informed that Anthology Film Archives
seems interested. And a video deal may be forthcoming. I told an
indie-filmmaker friend from Los Angeles the whole story, and she
laughed and said she would probably have done as Rupert did.
</P>
<P>
   I rang him up just now, to note that I was writing my candid
take on our movie-to-screen experience, and wondering what his
reflections might be. We hadn't spoken since early March; he had
been busy, I gathered, with ``Toby's Story,' his religious thriller
for MGM.
</P>
<P>
   I must say our talk wasn't pleasant. Rupert insisted vehemently
that his New York actions were solely to give ``The Sadness of
Sex'' a chance in the theater, before the critics tore it to bits,
as seemed their wont. What's more, after all the toil, all the
money he had spent on our film, he felt hurt and outraged at what
he saw as the possibility of my stabbing him in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Which shows that a sense of betrayal in the movies is a feeling
not exclusive to anyone. That grand Hollywood term ``lawsuit''
floated over the telephone wire.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the inevitable place to end a film-world tale. But
let's try for a happier finis. Me, I've actually had another book
optioned _ by a studio. Dennis Hopper tantalized briefly, on
something else. Billy Bob Thornton, too. No new Candide-ian
miracles yet. But at least I get to change topics from
you-know-what.

MERCURY, SHOCK HAVE LEAGUE'S AUSSIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Say today's Mercury game at Detroit was at
a tennis venue instead of The Palace of Auburn Hills.
</P>
<P>
   And say there were about 8,000 fewer people in attendance, the
drabber uniforms said ``Adelaide'' and ``Sydney,'' the pay was
minuscule and, well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, the WNBA isn't. But it may feel a bit like Down Under
on the court tonight when six of the league's seven active Aussies
will be playing, with another working the bench as an assistant
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, we've all played our best for and against each
other, and it'll be nice to catch up,'' said Mercury point guard
Michelle Timms, who began her professional career in 1984 with the
Bulleen Boomers of Australia's Women's National Basketball League
and has played professionally for 13 years. ``But as soon as we
cross the lines there, it's going to be white-line fever and it
won't matter. It is definitely indicative of how far Australia
basketball has come.''
</P>
<P>
   Timms was joined this summer on the Mercury (7-3) by her
Australian national team backup, Kristi Harrower, reigning WNBL
Most Valuable Player Michelle Griffiths and national team assistant
coach Carrie Graf, a Mercury assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, they joined forces with the Shock's Sandy
Brondello, Rachael Sporn and Carla Porter to bring Australia a
bronze medal at the World Championships, with an eye peeled for the
2000 Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the Phoenix Aussies will try to derail their Detroit
counterparts, who had won six straight until a Monday loss at New
York dropped the Shock to 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Timms, Griffiths, Brondello and Porter likely will start in the
WNBA's biggest cultural fest to date. Both teams have seven
international players, tops in the league, but the other eight
non-Americans are from eight different nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to playing them in a different environment
outside Australia,'' Griffiths said. ``It's an advantage and a
disadvantage. We know them, and they know us.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths and her fellow Opals, as the national players are
called, are not strangers to the idea of pro basketball. The WNBL
was established in Australia in 1981, but despite its 17 years of
existence, it is nowhere near WNBA standards.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA's minimum salary ($13,000) is equal to some Australian
teams' payrolls. Most of the WNBL arenas hold about 7,000 people,
but even those look empty. Game crowds start with a few hundred and
normally crawl up to about 1,000 only because they are played as
doubleheaders, with the men's league teams playing in the later
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Final championship game draws an average of 7,000 to
the 15,000-seat Melbourne Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd in Phoenix is so loud to me,'' said Griffiths, who
works for an employment agency despite her elite status at home.
``I had an ear infection my first game and my ears were ringing. I
had goose bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Australians work as basketball players the way American kids get
jobs at the mall. Most of them start playing professionally when
they are teenagers. Porter was 15 when she started, while nearly
all of the others began later in their teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would freak out about that here (in the United States),''
said Porter, who joined the WNBA expansion Shock this year with
Brondello and Sporn. ``No one was being paid anything when I
started (eight years ago). It's changed to reasonable money and has
become more professional. Our profiles are lifted because we are on
TV now.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter remembers holding raffles and carwashes to fund her first
pro team. Timms used to attend college, work the 9 p.m. to 7 a.m.
shift at Denny's and train at night while holding down other
off-season jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never professional in regard to the financial part, but
it was always a full-time commitment,'' Timms said.
</P>
<P>
   Timms is the Australian women's basketball icon. She put stars
in the eyes of kids such as Harrower, who has evolved from grade
school admirer to her backup. Harrower left her native island for
the first time ever because Timms put in the word to acquire her.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Australia, Timmsy is like a Cheryl Miller,'' Harrower said.
``She put Australia on the map. When we were in New York, somebody
came up and asked, `Are you Michelle Timms?' In New York? That's
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Basketball still fights for its place in Australia. Cricket,
tennis and Australian Rules Football are the nation's passions.
Basketball just recently has become the nation's favorite women's
sport, Graf said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty surprising considering how well we do on the
international level,'' said Graf, whose duties as an Australian pro
team coach included landing sponsors and writing press releases.
</P>
<P>
   Timms, Brondello and Sporn were the only Australians that the
WNBA actually recruited. The rest were signed or drafted by teams,
mostly because they were looking to increase their tempo of play.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a language barrier doesn't hurt, although many
American players will tell you they could use a translator when
speaking with the Australians.
</P>
<P>
   With 33 WNBA players from outside the United States, only
Bulgaria comes even close to Australia's seven-player
representation, with three Bulgarians in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to run and play aggressive defense,'' Timms said.
``That's why so many Australians play here compared to others
because the game is so similar to the style here. Our game is more
disciplined, though. If you don't make it through the offense at
home, you're dragged off the court.'' &QL;

TKACHUK WANTS TALKS TO RESUME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There has been no contact between the Coyotes and team
captain  &UR; Keith Tkachuk in the eight days since General Manager
 &UR; Bobby
 &UR; Smith pulled the team's latest offer on a contract extension off
the table.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk's agent,  &UR; Bob Murray of Boston, said he is still willing
to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   If negotiations are not re-opened before training camp begins in
early September, Tkachuk could be headed for a lengthy holdout
despite the fact he has two years remaining on his current deal
worth $5.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful he will agree to play out those final two seasons
as is, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, however, might not make any more offers beyond the
three-year extension Tkachuk rejected worth a total of $33 million
_ an average of $6.5 million a year for five years. There are no
guarantees that offer still exists, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't cut the talks off, they did,'' Murray said. ``We're
prepared to negotiate and we have been, but we can't force (Smith)
back to the table. . . . If he wants to, fine. That's his choice.
We've never shut the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, however, has indicated Murray and Tkachuk won't budge
from their $8 million-per-year asking price, a restructured,
five-year deal worth $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a question of ``if'' they can pay it,''
Murray said. ``I think it's a question of do they ``want'' to pay
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray wouldn't say if he will attempt to re-open talks himself
by calling Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get hung up on who calls who,'' he said.
``We're here. We've been here. We're prepared to negotiate at any
time and hopefully, it'll happen.'' &QL; 
Quint on trading block &QL; 
Defenseman  &UR; Deron Quint, who was expected to be promoted to the
Coyotes' everyday six-man rotation next season, apparently is on
the trading block and could be dealt within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   At least three teams have entered negotiations with Phoenix,
sources said, to land the 22-year-old offensive defenseman, who
scored four goals and 11 points in 32 games last season. It isn't
known whom the Coyotes are seeking in return.
</P>
<P>
   Quint, the franchise's first pick in the 1994 draft, never
really meshed with Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld despite his potential.
Four years ago, during his last year of juniors, he scored 29 goals
and 89 points in 65 games for Seattle in the Western Hockey League.
Since then, he's split his time between the NHL and the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Quint, a restricted free agent who earned $400,000 a year ago,
must clear waivers if he is sent to the minors at any point next
season. &QL; 
Baron ready to move &QL; 
The agent for Coyotes unrestricted free agent defenseman  &UR; Murray
Baron said his client is close to signing with another team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could happen as early as (today),''  &UR; Steve Mountain said
Tuesday, ``but I'm not going to be in any hurry now that I've seen
some of these recent deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, who could have re-signed Baron for $1.3 million per
year last season, won't attempt to pay him the $2 million Baron now
likely will get on the open market. He also became expendable when
Phoenix shocked several NHL teams Friday by signing free-agent
defenseman  &UR; Jyrki Limme of Vancouver to a five-year, $17 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Baron, who likely will sign a three-year deal worth at least
$6.6 million, is being courted by several teams. &QL;

 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Utah, Okla.) (bl) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Officially, the disappearance of Irene Silverman, an
82-year-old Upper East Side socialite, was still listed on Tuesday
as a missing-persons case, an incident without motive, witness, or
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an elderly female who has disappeared very
mysteriously,'' said Police Inspector Joseph Reznick.
</P>
<P>
   But as a team of detectives fanned out across the city, seeking
traces of Ms. Silverman, they also sought clues about two people
already in custody _ an unlikely mother-son team of con artists who
have been convicted of crimes as varied as stealing fur coats and
enslaving Mexican immigrants and who are wanted for questioning in
a Los Angeles murder.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Silverman, whose home decor was inspired in part by the
palace of Versailles, was last seen walking through her town house
in a nightgown on Sunday morning and was reported missing by her
housekeeping staff on Sunday night. On Monday evening, after
finding blood outside Ms. Silverman's apartment, police released a
sketch of a tenant who was wanted for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   A New York City detective who happened to see the sketch on
television immediately alerted Manhattan investigators to a
fortunate coincidence: the man, known to Ms. Silverman as Manny
Guerin and to investigators as Kenneth Kimes, was already behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes, 23, had been arrested along with his 63-year-old mother,
Sante Kimes, on an unrelated federal warrant on Sunday evening that
accused him of passing a bad $14,000 check in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   That discovery led to more intriguing clues. The Kimeses were
carrying Ms. Silverman's identification at the time of their
arrest, said an investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity,
and detectives said that their curiosity was further piqued by a
call from Los Angeles police, who want to question the Kimeses in
connection with the murder of a man whose body was found in a
garbage bin in Venice on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Los Angeles Police Department declined to
identify the victim or discuss the case. But another law
enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that the victim was a Granada Hills, Calif., man whose home was
sold after his death and the proceeds apparently stolen.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department, Officer
Eduardo Funes, said that police were investigating the death of the
man, David Kazdin, 63, but said that there were no suspects and
declined to discuss details of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Another law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that Kazdin's home was sold after his death and the
proceeds were apparently stolen; detectives want to question the
Kimeses to determine whether they have information about the case.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan on East 65th Street on Tuesday, neighbors,
employees, and acquaintances said that they were worried for Ms.
Silverman's safety, and they related incidents and anecdotes from a
unique and intriguing life.
</P>
<P>
   Professor James Schenton, who befriended Ms. Silverman 20 years
ago when she took his history course at Columbia University,
described her as a sprightly octogenarian with a storied past and
passionate interest in the arts and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   She was a former dancer with the corps de ballet at Radio City
Music Hall in the early 1930s, who gave up the stage for society
and later married. Her husband Samuel died in 1973, and friends
said that in her later years, Ms. Silverman had channeled her
enthusiasm toward her multi-million dollar limestone home, half a
block from Central Park, which she had divided into lavish
apartments and operated as a sort of boarding house for the
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a woman who has a fascinating propensity to become
involved in all kinds of things,'' Schenton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after Ms. Silverman's disappearance, police
immediately grew concerned, because it was unheard of for her to
leave the home unaccompanied by a member of her domestic staff,
Reznick said. A search of the property brought another chilling
discovery, an investigator said _ a trail of blood on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator said that one servant had told detectives that
Ms. Silverman recently argued with Kimes and had threatened to
evict him from his $6,000-a-month apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He apparently kept watching her, and that rubbed her the wrong
way,'' said an investigator. ``She had very high standards and
occasionally threw people out if they weren't up to snuff. And the
thought of a guest keeping her under surveillance, that was just
too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kimes and his mother both declined to answer questions
from investigators, their extensive criminal records painted a
portrait of a family with a long history of swindles.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kimes, an Oklahoma native who has used eight aliases, has a
handful of arrests for theft, using forged credentials and fraud,
according to police records. She once sued a San Diego doctor for
malpractice, but according to court documents, she herself was
forced to pay a damages because the charges were untrue.
</P>
<P>
   She was found guilty of stealing a $6,500 mink coat from the
Mayflower Hotel in Washington in 1985, court records show. In 1986,
Ms. Kimes was convicted of enticing young women from Mexico across
the border to her home in La Jolla, California, then preventing
them from leaving and forcing them to work in virtual slavery. Ms.
Kimes served a five-year sentence in federal prison, according to
law enforcement records.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two years, Ms. Kimes had apparently begun
operating with her son Kenneth, who had robbery and assault
convictions in Florida, police said. The pair had lived together
briefly in California and have been sought by federal officials
since April, when they allegedly used a bad check to purchase a
Lincoln Town car.
</P>
<P>
   Although some investigators held out hope that Ms. Silverman
would be found alive, the grim reality of police work forced them
to explore the worst possibilities. Officers searched Central Park
early on Tuesday but found no signs of Ms. Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   On two separate occasions they were also called to a recycling
center in the Hunt's Point section of the Bronx, where human body
parts were discovered. After conferring with the city medical
examiner, detectives determined that neither the human arm nor the
human leg discovered there could have belonged to Ms. Silverman,
though it was not clear whose they were.

INFUSION OF CAPITAL LIFTS OUTLOOK FOR MUSTANGS

<P>
   PHOENIX - Minor league hockey has apparently gotten a reprieve
in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Mustangs of the West Coast Hockey League appeared to
be headed toward extinction after only one season because of
financial problems. But a local hotel developer has stepped up to
purchase 50 percent of the team and keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jenkins, president of Phoenix-based Hotel Development
Corp. and partner in Seattle-based West Coast Hotels, which
includes among its holdings the Executive Park on North Central,
has purchased half of the club from owner Mike Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   WCHL President Mike McCall said the transaction has been
approved, and the deal will be completed by the middle of July.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, McCall said Jenkins will be managing
general partner of the club and also will manage Veterans Memorial
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Jenkins has a solid background,'' McCall said. ``He's an
outstanding businessman and a good person. I'm ecstatic. The
capital is there to really operate the team properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be someone there with hands on locally, which has
to happen in this business. It just doesn't work any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think money will be a problem anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a huge problem last season.
</P>
<P>
   The club amassed about $250,000 in debt, some of it the result
of a league policy that requires the home team to pay for hotel
accommodations for the visiting clubs.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said Jenkins will address the debt and put the franchise
back on firm footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's responsible for a hotel business with 12,000 employees in
the western United States,'' McCall said. ``That ($250,000) is a
substantial debt if you don't have any money. But he's taking care
of that immediately. He has total credibility. He will enhance the
team's integrity immensely. He'll take care of those (financial)
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said he ultimately could become involved in an
arena-hotel project in Mesa as well. He has developed and is in the
process of developing similar projects in other areas of the West,
including one in Boise, Idaho, which houses another WCHL team.
</P>
<P>
   Another group is working on a plan for an arena-hotel complex in
Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see what that group is going to do, and I'd love to talk
to them about being a tenant there,'' Jenkins said. ``If they don't
(go forward), we would be willing to step in, or do a joint
venture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs, who played their games at Veterans Memorial
Coliseum, were competitive in their first year, going 36-25 before
getting swept by San Diego in the first round of the playoffs. But
the business end of the organization was in such disarray ownership
cleaned out the entire front office staff, including General
Manager Adam Keller, at the end of last season.
</P>
<P>
   It was the club's first season in the fledgling 10-team league,
which includes a franchise in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affordable hockey can go here (in Phoenix),'' Jenkins said.
``You can take a family to a Mustangs game for what you pay for one
person to go to a Coyotes game. And you can see all the game from
our seats.''

SEMTECH PAINTS POOR QUARTERLY PROFIT PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Chip producer Semtech Corp., in a move likely to
further hammer its already-slack stock price, announced after U.S.
stock markets closed that quarterly profits will fall far short of
Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Semtech blamed weak demand from the personal computer and
automated test equipment markets. It added that those trends have
been aggravated by the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which sells to the communications, computer and
industrial markets, said profits in its second quarter ending Aug.
2 will be 40 percent to 50 percent lower than first-quarter
earnings of $4.7 million, or 30 cents per diluted share. Wall
Street's consensus estimate of five analysts polled by IBES called
for second-quarter profits of 30 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Arun Veerappan of Bancamerica Robertson Stephens said
the announcement caught him off guard. ``We knew that the industry
was in a slowdown, but the magnitude of this decline is a
surprise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan said the company remains fundamentally sound and
should be able to improve its results in subsequent quarters. He
added that he retains his ``buy'' rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Semtech said second-quarter sales will be down 15 percent from
first-quarter revenues of $23.2 million. It also announced it will
take a $2.5 million pretax restructuring charge to cut production
capacity and write off the value of those assets.
</P>
<P>
   Semtech stock has lost more than half its value since February,
when it hit $29.75, as chip issues have fallen out of favor because
of the Asian crisis. On Monday it lost 3] to $14.375 as analyst
Douglas Lee of NationsBanc Montgomery cut his quarterly estimate to
27 cents from 30 cents, citing weak industry conditions from excess
inventory and slowing in Europe. The issue gained 1/16 to $14.4375
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said Tuesday that he will keep his ``buy'' rating. ``The
magnitude of the earnings shortfall is surprising, so they'll have
to take a near-term hit, but they are taking the right steps to
position themselves for long-term growth,'' he added, citing bright
prospects in Semtech's circuit protection products.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Newbury Park in neighboring Ventura
County, did not disclose on Tuesday whether it will cut any jobs.
It also said the computer market might improve slightly in the
third quarter with sustainable growth in the fourth quarter; flat
results in the test equipment market for the rest of the year, with
growth resuming in the first quarter of 1999; and a fundamentally
solid performance in communications.

COMPANY LED BY TOP ADMIRAL BUYS VACCINE LAB

 (ATTN: Mich.)  (lb) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The state of Michigan on Tuesday approved the sale of the United
States' only licensed manufacturer of anthrax and rabies vaccine to
a company led by Adm. William Crowe Jr., a former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and the U.S. ambassador to Britain until last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the Michigan Biologic Products Institute, the last
state-owned vaccine laboratory in the United States, gives Crowe's
newly formed company, BioPort Corp., an inside track on at least
$60 million in Pentagon contracts for anthrax vaccine to protect
the nation's 2.4 million members of the armed forces and reservists
against an anthrax attack.
</P>
<P>
   The rickety plant, which has been run by the Michigan Department
of Community Health, has lost millions of dollars annually for
years. So in 1996 Michigan decided to sell it to the highest
bidder. No one was seriously interested, even after the Pentagon
announced it would pay for a $1.8 million renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The situation changed in December 1997 when the Clinton
administration threatened to go to war over Iraq's intransigence in
giving free access to U.N. inspectors. Defense Secretary William
Cohen announced that all U.S. troops and reservists would get
anthrax shots _ a first for the military.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the old plant was a hot property. Michigan reopened the
bidding in January and a dozen companies considered the plant. Five
made firm offers and, in late May, the Pentagon made the deal even
sweeter by announcing plans to invest an additional $15 million to
double the plant's vaccine output. The plant is currently closed
for renovation.
</P>
<P>
   BioPort, whose headquarters are in Lansing, Mich., is made up of
several partners besides Crowe. One is Fuad El-Hibri, a German
citizen of Lebanese descent who has marketed drugs and succeeded in
turning a British government plant for vaccine production into a
successful private venture.
</P>
<P>
   The other partners are Neogen Corp., a Lansing-based company
that develops and markets diagnostic tests, and Michigan Biologic
Products Inc., which is made up of seven managers of the
state-owned plant, including the laboratory's director, Robert
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   State employees were specifically permitted by the Michigan
Legislature to bid on the sale; the legislators hoped that
retaining local management as investors would help keep the
money-losing plant and its 174 jobs in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said that on June 2 the state commission
responsible for selling the plant chose BioPort over four other
bidders. BioPort, it said, offered nearly $25 million in cash,
secured notes, product donations and royalties. On Tuesday, a board
under the chairmanship of Michigan's governor, John Engler,
approved the decision, the final stage of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also disclosed that BioPort's bid included only
$3.5 million in up-front cash payable at the closing, but also
$12.1 million in secured notes, product donations valued at $4.6
million and $5 million in royalties to be paid over five years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Defense contractors often hire retired officers like Crowe. The
practice, as old as Washington's revolving door, gives companies
insights into the often Byzantine workings of the military
bureaucracy. But it also has been faulted for the favoritism that
can arise when officers deal with former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1985
to 1989, when he retired after 47 years in the military, said in a
recent interview that he was aware of the risk of favoritism and
the perception of it, but that he believed a move to strengthen the
nation's defenses against an anthrax attack was more important.
</P>
<P>
   The 73-year-old retired Navy admiral, who resigned as ambassador
to Britain last year, was one of the most senior military figures
to support Clinton in the 1992 presidential campaign. Crowe said he
had not discussed with the president the vaccine issue or his
effort to buy the plant. Crowe also said he had not received any
favorable consideration from senior Defense Department officials
who had met with the final bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The former ambassador said he had put no personal assets into
the plant's purchase and would be compensated only when, and if,
the plant made money. And he acknowledged that his personal
experience in pharmaceuticals was limited to once having served on
the board of Pfizer, one of the world's leading drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that his knowledge of the Defense Department would
prove useful, because BioPort would soon be negotiating with the
department over the purchase price of future batches of vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The profitability of their venture hinges largely on whether
BioPort can cut a favorable deal with the military, the
laboratory's main customer.
</P>
<P>
   State officials called the sale a good deal for Michigan. A 1996
estimate of its value _ done before plans were announced to
vaccinate all troops and to expand and renovate the plant _ put its
value at anywhere from ``nominal'' to $10.5 million, depending on
how much anthrax vaccine was sold at what price.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe said that he was not sure if his team's investment would
make money in his lifetime, and that his main motive was to
preserve a national asset. ``The Michigan lab cannot be allowed to
go under,'' he said, adding that its success is ``imperative for
the country.''

SANDERS WANTS SWINGS AT BOB

   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Diamondbacks outfielder  &UR; David Dellucci remembers
a lanky outfielder who helped Auburn to the College World Series
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That outfielder, Cardinals wide receiver  &UR; Frank Sanders,
remembers Dellucci as a ``crusher, a guy who can hit'' from when
Dellucci played against him in the Southeastern Conference at
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sanders would like to show Dellucci his swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to go (to Bank One Ballpark) and take batting
practice,'' said Sanders, who hit .270 his junior year and was
named All-SEC Western Division.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is running out of time if he wants to take batting
practice. The Cardinals open training camp July 23 in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, meanwhile, return to Bank One Ballpark on
Friday for a three-game series against the Cincinnati Reds. &QL; 
Quick healer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals defensive end  &UR; Brad  &UR; Ottis, who suffered a broken bone
in his left foot two months ago, has started running.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials think Ottis might be limited at the beginning of
training camp but should be at full strength for most of camp.
</P>
<P>
   Ottis was scheduled to start at left defensive end during
minicamp before the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie  &UR; Andre Wadsworth, the team's first-round draft choice
from Florida State, replaced Ottis as a starter during minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth and second-round pick  &UR; Corey Chavous, a defensive back
from Vanderbilt, are unsigned. &QL; 
Joining the club &QL; 
Cardinals quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer is the newest member of the NFL
Quarterback Club, an exclusive group of league quarterbacks who
market themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer joined Tuesday along with  &UR; Brad Johnson of Minnesota,
 &UR; Danny Kanell of the New York Giants and rookies  &UR; Peyton Manning of
Indianapolis and  &UR; Ryan Leaf of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   A few non-quarterbacks are in the group, including  &UR; Terrell
 &UR; Davis, the Denver Broncos running back who was the Most Valuable
Player of Super Bowl XXXII.
</P>
<P>
   The group was formed in 1991 and, according to league officials,
``offers corporate America a chance to tap in the popularity and
power of the NFL's biggest stars.'' &QL; 
Versatile performer &QL; 
Navy offensive tackle  &UR; Mike  &UR; Wahle, one of the top players
available in Thursday's supplemental draft, continues to receive a
lot of interest from teams around the league.
</P>
<P>
   Wahle, pronounced ``Wall,'' visited an undisclosed team Monday
after coming to Tempe last month to meet with Cardinals officials.
</P>
<P>
   His agent,  &UR; Neil Cornrich, said ``numerous'' teams have brought
Wahle in for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Wahle, 6 feet 5, 302 pounds, played left tackle at Navy, but
Cornrich said he could play any position on the line.
</P>
<P>
   He recently bench-pressed 225 pounds 35 times. He also has run
the 40-yard dash in 4.9 seconds. &QL; 
Historical perspective &QL; 
Chavous, who has 400 videotapes of NFL games in his personal
library, continues to wow people with his sense of league history.
</P>
<P>
   He stole the show at last week's NFL symposium during a session
about dealing with the media.
</P>
<P>
   Chavous questioned the moderator, former New York Giants
quarterback  &UR; Phil Simms, who will be a CBS-TV analyst this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil, in 1990 when the Giants started 11-0 and (Jeff)
Hostetler took over and (the Giants) won the Super Bowl, how did
you handle the media pressure the next year in training camp?''
Chavous asked.
</P>
<P>
   Chavous also asked Denver Broncos quarterback  &UR; John Elway about
his disastrous debut in 1983 in Pittsburgh. Elway completed only 1
of 8 passes, was sacked four times and was intercepted. &QL;

TEXAS MAN KILLS 4, INCLUDING BORDER AGENTS, BEFORE BEING FATALLY
SHOT

<P>
   SAN BENITO, Texas _ A Rio Grande Valley man, reportedly enraged
over a broken love affair, went on a rampage Tuesday with assault
weapons, killing his rival's mother and sister and two U.S. Border
Patrol agents before being fatally wounded by lawmen's bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The victims included the first woman Border Patrol agent killed
in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Also injured in the early morning shootings were the man's
romantic rival, who was in critical condition after six hours of
surgery at a Harlingen hospital, and a Cameron County sheriff's
deputy, who was in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   The first gunfire, which erupted shortly after 5 a.m. at a Rio
Hondo residence, was followed by a shootout between the suspect and
law officers about two hours later south of San Benito, about 15
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings launched a massive land and air search for
additional suspects in the San Benito area. For almost eight hours,
more than a 150 officers from at least a dozen federal, state and
local agencies probed a field of head-high corn in search of
additional gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The search was called off shortly after 2 p.m. when authorities
concluded that there were no other suspects in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities identified the gunman as Ernie Moore, 24, the son of
a Harlingen police detective &UR;  &LR; and the brother of a San Benito
police patrolman.  &UR;  &LR; Surgeons worked for four hours Tuesday
afternoon in an attempt to repair the damage caused by multiple
gunshot wounds, but Moore died about 5 p.m. at Valley Baptist
Medical Center in nearby Harlingen.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's purported rival, Dan Morin, 22, remained in critical
condition late in the day. The sheriff's deputy, Raul Rodriguez,
32, was in stable condition after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Killed by Moore's hand, police said, were Morin's 53-year-old
mother, Margarita Flores, his sister, Delia Morin, 31, and Border
Patrol agents Susan Lynn Rodriguez, 28, and Ricardo Guillermo
Salinas, 24, both of Harlingen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy. It's unexpected as well, but we do live in a
changing world,'' said Rio Hondo Police Chief Carlos Gonzalez.
Gonzalez, who has been chief law officer in the town of 2,500 for
seven years, said Tuesday's killings are the first he's been called
upon to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the Rio Hondo victims who gathered at the hospital
Tuesday said Dan Morin had been dating Moore's former girlfriend,
Julie Cox, for about a month. Authorities said Cox had been hiding
out from Moore at the family's home at the time of the incident.
She was not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Morin's brother, Donald Morin, said he woke up about 5 a.m. and
was going into the garage to retrieve a fan when he saw Moore pull
up in his pickup. Moore entered the home through the unlocked
garage door.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he saw me, he pointed that gun at my head,'' Donald Morin
said. ``He came prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore then demanded to see his ex-girlfriend. When Donald Morin
returned from a rear room with his brother and Cox, Moore demanded
that the woman leave with him.
</P>
<P>
   When Flores unexpectedly emerged from a bathroom, Moore turned
and opened fire. Delia Morin, apparently alerted by the noise, then
walked from the living room and also was fatally shot. Then Moore
turned his weapon on Dan Morin and shot him four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked at me and he was fixing to shoot me and I had to do
something,'' Donald Morin said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Donald Morin and two other men in the house
attacked Moore and disarmed him. After a brief struggle, Moore fled
the house and sped south in a white Chevrolet extended-cab pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio said deputies, alerted to the
crime, chased the vehicle a short distance before losing sight of
it west of the San Benito city limits. About 30 minutes later,
deputies spotted the truck parked at the home of the suspect's
father and called for assistance. The Border Patrol agents and
others responded.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Ranger Ray Cano said officers briefly talked with the
man's father. As they returned to their patrol cars, Moore rose
from a nearby corn field and opened fire with a .223-caliber
semiautomatic rifle, striking the sheriff's deputy and the two
Border Patrol agents. Other deputies returned fire, striking Moore
four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Border Patrol agents) didn't even get a chance to take
our their weapons,'' said Harry Beall, assistant chief agent for
the McAllen Border Patrol sector. ``This guy hopped out right by
the Border Patrol vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the guns _ a Chinese-made version of an AK-47
and the semiautomatic rifle _ were part of a private family gun
collection and were not police department property.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a deputy's report that Moore had been accompanied by
two other individuals, authorities sealed off the area around the
senior Moore's home and began the intensive search.
</P>
<P>
   For hours, Border Patrol airplanes and helicopters circled the
area as officers on horseback and on foot and bloodhounds scoured
the rugged terrain. The area is marked by cotton and corn fields,
and waterways surrounded by dense brush. At one point, authorities
contemplated leveling the corn fields with a tractor, but
ultimately decided against that option.
</P>
<P>
   The search was abandoned by mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only suspect we have right now,'' Sheriff Lucio said a
short time later, ``is the one in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, authorities have not discounted the deputy's
assertion that three people occupied the truck. ``We're still
investigating,'' Lucio said.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Morin said his family was unaware that Cox had come to
their home for protection. She had been living there for the past
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just said that today (at the hospital),'' he said. ``If I
had known that, I'd have thrown her out of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Cox told him Tuesday that Moore had threatened her
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had always made threats that he was going to rob banks,
that he was going to do this and that, that he was going to kill
her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol spokesmen said Susan Rodriguez, the daughter of a
retired deputy chief patrol agent with the Border Patrol who had
been an agent for six years, and Salinas, who had been with the
organization since last year, were the third and fourth agents to
die in the line of duty this year.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-one agents have died while on duty since the agency was
founded 74 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of Rodriguez and Salinas, both federal agents, will
lead the FBI to enter the investigation, Roderick Beverly, special
agent in charge of the San Antonio FBI office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Border Patrol's
parent Immigration and Naturalization Service, cut short a tour of
Laredo INS facilities to go to the lower Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   She described Rodriguez and Salinas as ``courageous and heroic
officers,'' and decried violence directed at the agency's officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message should be loud and clear,'' she said. ``Those
cutting down law enforcement officers will be brought to justice.''

LIFETIME NETWORK FEATURES ALL-FEMALE PRODUCTION FOR WNBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Having an almost all-female team involved in the
production of WNBA telecasts might seem to be a strategic decision
by the Lifetime Television Network, but in reality, it was just
luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the interesting thing,'' said Doug McCormick, president
and CEO of Lifetime. ``We didn't plan it this way. When we put out
the word that we were looking for people for the crew, it attracted
the best women in the business. A lot of them wanted to work on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wound up getting the best people in the business, and they
happened to be women. This is a classic example of not setting out
to do that. That was no gimmickry involved at all, just the luck of
the draw.''
</P>
<P>
   And even the lone male member of the crew, broadcaster Reggie
Miller, fits right in. His sister, Cheryl, is the coach of the
Mercury, whose game Friday against the Rockers will be broadcast on
Lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The on-air team is headed by Michelle Tafoya, who previously
drew good reviews for her work for CBS-TV. Meghan Pattyson, a
former assistant coach at the University of Connecticut, joins
Miller as an analyst. Others on the team include courtside reporter
Summers Sanders; halftime host Maura Driscoll; and Mary Murphy,
former coach of the Monarchs, who offers insights in a ``Murphy's
Law'' segment.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the telecasts is Lisa Seltzer. Others in the
background include line producer Amy Rosenfeld, sideline producer
Denise Cavanaugh, and halftime producer Maureen Hassett.
</P>
<P>
   In the overall scheme, `this is a significant step in televised
sports production,'' McCormick said. ``There are many excellent
women in sports production who've never been given the helm.''
</P>
<P>
   So how did Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers wind up in this
group?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, putting aside my feelings of being a New York Knicks
fan, Reggie brings a wonderful presence to the air,'' McCormick
said. ``Secondly, with his connection to Cheryl, he brings good
input into the sport, and he's a very strong proponent of women
athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime also televised WNBA games in the inaugural 1997 season,
and its ratings are up slightly, according to McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone as high as 1.0, but mostly we're in the .6 range,''
he said. ``We're not as high as we are when a movie is on, but the
good news is that we are bringing new women (viewers) to the sport.
We know that because if you take a look at ESPN and NBC, for
example, the majority of viewership is male. Only on Lifetime is
the majority of viewership women.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime will televise 16 WNBA games, including playoffs, this
season. One other Mercury game, July 31 in Los Angeles, is part of
the package.
</P>
<P>
   The network also will air women's college basketball, a women's
triathlon and the LPGA Tournament of Champions for Breast Cancer
Awareness. In addition, Lifetime is an official sponsor of the
Women's World Cup soccer championship, to be contested next year. &QL;

TEXAS MAN KILLS 4, INCLUDING BORDER AGENTS, BEFORE BEING FATALLY
SHOT

<P>
   SAN BENITO, Texas _ A Rio Grande Valley man, reportedly enraged
over a broken love affair, went on a rampage Tuesday with assault
weapons, killing his rival's mother and sister and two U.S. Border
Patrol agents before being fatally wounded by lawmen's bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The victims included the first woman Border Patrol agent killed
in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Also injured in the early morning shootings were the man's
romantic rival, who was in critical condition after six hours of
surgery at a Harlingen hospital, and a Cameron County sheriff's
deputy, who was in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   The first gunfire, which erupted shortly after 5 a.m. at a Rio
Hondo residence, was followed by a shootout between the suspect and
law officers about two hours later south of San Benito, about 15
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings launched a massive land and air search for
additional suspects in the San Benito area. For almost eight hours,
more than a 150 officers from at least a dozen federal, state and
local agencies probed a field of head-high corn in search of
additional gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The search was called off shortly after 2 p.m. when authorities
concluded that there were no other suspects in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities identified the gunman as Ernie Moore, 24, the son of
a Harlingen police detective &UR;  &LR; and the brother of a San Benito
police patrolman.  &UR;  &LR; Surgeons worked for four hours Tuesday
afternoon in an attempt to repair the damage caused by multiple
gunshot wounds, but Moore died about 5 p.m. at Valley Baptist
Medical Center in nearby Harlingen.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's purported rival, Dan Morin, 22, remained in critical
condition late in the day. The sheriff's deputy, Raul Rodriguez,
32, was in stable condition after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Killed by Moore's hand, police said, were Morin's 53-year-old
mother, Margarita Flores, his sister, Delia Morin, 31, and Border
Patrol agents Susan Lynn Rodriguez, 28, and Ricardo Guillermo
Salinas, 24, both of Harlingen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy. It's unexpected as well, but we do live in a
changing world,'' said Rio Hondo Police Chief Carlos Gonzalez.
Gonzalez, who has been chief law officer in the town of 2,500 for
seven years, said Tuesday's killings are the first he's been called
upon to investigate.

COURT BACKS REMOVAL OF JUDGE WHOSE LENIENCY LED TO OUTRAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Lorin Duckman, the New York City judge who became
a favorite target of politicians' complaints about a fuzzy-minded,
too-lenient judiciary, lost his final bid to retain his job Tuesday
when the state's highest court ruled that a state commission was
right to remove him from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   For Duckman, the ruling completes an unusual and abrupt journey
from obscure Criminal Court judge in Brooklyn to political pariah
because of his decision to lower the bail of a man jailed on
domestic abuse charges who was then released and who subsequently
killed his former girlfriend, Galina Komar, and himself.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Benito Oliver, had been jailed on charges that he beat
and threatened Ms. Komar and violated court orders to stay away
from her. Although prosecutors strenuously objected to a lower
bail, Duckman ruled otherwise and said all would be well if Ms.
Komar would just return Oliver's dog.
</P>
<P>
   The case brought declarations of outrage from Gov. George
Pataki, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and others and led to an
investigation by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct. The
commission did not find fault with Duckman's handling of the Oliver
case, but did find that in many other cases he had shown a
pro-defense bias, breaking rules to benefit the accused and roundly
abusing prosecutors. Last October, on a 7-4 vote, it ordered him
removed from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was highly unusual, in that few judges in New York
are removed for the way they conduct cases in court, and when they
are, it is almost always for unfairly favoring the prosecution, not
the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Court of Appeals, in a 5-2 decision, upheld the
commission's decision. Duckman was moved to the Civil Court after
Ms. Komar was killed, and was put on paid leave after the
commission's decision. Tuesday's ruling removes him from office
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   At his home in Brooklyn, a drawn-looking Duckman said, ``I had
faith in the process, and I feel it failed,'' but he refused to be
drawn into a discussion of the politics of his case.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he had acted improperly in some cases. ``I
am not an ideologue or judicial ogre,'' he added. ``There are
things I said in court that should not have been said, and in
retrospect, had I had an opportunity to say them, I would not.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know what he would do next.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the court found that Duckman refused to hear
prosecutors' arguments when he decided to dismiss cases, dismissed
cases in which the defense had not requested dismissal and did not
give prosecutors notice before dismissing cases, all in violation
of the rules of criminal procedure.
</P>
<P>
   He was often derisive toward prosecutors, telling one, ``You
don't have an objection, you are just mouthing some words that
somebody told you, for no reason, and insulting me,'' and asking
another if he had got his law license ``on the back of an orange
juice carton.'' He told one prosecutor that she was ``too sexy'' to
wear flat shoes, and another that she looked better in short
skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki welcomed the ruling. ``By upholding the removal of Judge
Duckman, the Court of Appeals has also upheld my belief that there
is no room on the bench for judges who willfully disregard the law,
abuse their judicial powers and demonstrate a pattern of bias
against the prosecution and police,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Commission on Judicial Conduct was created in its
current form in 1979, it has removed 124 judges from the bench,
many of them part-time town and village justices. Of those, 55 have
appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals, where 47 have lost.
Judges have been removed for misconduct out of court, like
falsifying credit applications or drunken driving, for sexual
harassment and for lying to the commission's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The commission administrator, Gerald Stern, said that ``maybe a
dozen'' judges had been removed, like Duckman, for willfully
ignoring the law in their handling of cases, abusing their
discretion or mistreating people in the courtroom. Most of those,
he said, were part-time judges in small towns. No judge in New York
City has been removed for such reasons since 1983, he said. &QL;

 OWEN McGIVERN, 87, JUDGE WHO LED N.Y. APPELLATE COURT  
 (bl)  
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Owen McGivern, the son of an iceman who with the
backing of Tammany Hall rose through the ranks to become presiding
justice of the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court, July 6 at
New York University Medical Center. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said Joan, his wife of 43 years.
</P>
<P>
   McGivern grew up in Hell's Kitchen when the lives of Irish
immigrants revolved around two institutions: the parish church and
the local Democratic club. With the encouragement of the Rev.
Francis Duffy, his parish priest and the World War I military
chaplain, he attended Regis High School, Holy Cross College,
Columbia University and St. John's University Law School. He was
elected, at 25, to the state Assembly, moved on to a municipal
court judgeship and then state Supreme Court, all with Tammany's
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was proud of it,'' said Jim McManus, who heads the McManus
Democratic Club, one of the city's oldest local political clubs.
``Owen would say, `A man in dark glasses made me a Supreme Court
judge,' '' McManus said, a reference to Carmine De Sapio, the
Tammany Hall boss who decided which candidates the party would
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a product of the West Side,'' said James Gill, a lawyer
and friend. ``He never forgot where he came from.''
</P>
<P>
   McGivern favored the old system of political patronage, said
Timothy P. Sullivan, former secretary of the Society of the
Friendly Sons of St. Patrick. ``He wouldn't want any young man he
knew to go into politics now,'' Sullivan said. ``He would say,
`There's no organization, no strong leadership. How can you have a
political career that way?' ''
</P>
<P>
   From his election to the state Assembly in 1938, he was known
for his strong, persuasive and witty public speaking. ``He was
master raconteur,'' former Mayor Ed Koch said. ``He had the gift of
the leprechaun. He beguiled audiences with his humor and
intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a gift he used in the service of issues that he supported
throughout his career: improved schools and centers for juvenile
delinquents and mentally handicapped children and renovation and
refurbishing of dilapidated court buildings.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked several times to speak at the city's two biggest
dinners, attended by hundreds of people: the Alfred E. Smith Dinner
and the Society of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick event. ``People
would make a point of coming to just hear him,'' Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Crotty, a lawyer, Bell Atlantic executive and lifelong
friend, called McGivern one of the city's two best speakers. The
other, he said, was William Hughes Mulligan, a dean of Fordham Law
School and a former judge who died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never cracked a smile,'' Crotty said. ``He would get up and
make quick one-liners. He was self-deprecating, kidding the Irish
and the Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge's wife, Joan, put it succinctly: ``He would say that
the best speaker is a finished speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, he was elected a judge of the old City Court of New
York, and three years later, he won election to state Supreme
Court, where he served for 14 years. He ran in 1965 for judge of
the state Court of Appeals but lost to former U.S. Sen. Kenneth
Keating.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, he was appointed by Gov. Nelson Rockefeller to the
Appellate Division. Eight years later, he was designated the
presiding justice. He resigned in 1976 after saying that continuing
with an annual salary of $55,266 would `'work a financial
deprivation on my family.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the year that New York City was facing possible
bankruptcy. Appointed by Mayor Abraham Beame to study the fiscal
problems, he and his committee members produced hundreds of pages
during two years of study. They concluded that the city was
spending far too much on city personnel benefits. Furthermore, its
high taxes on businesses were driving them from the city.
</P>
<P>
   The study recommended wide-reaching budget cuts that, McGivern
wrote, ``will dramatically increase tomorrow's employment and
revenues.'' It also proposed that the city cede control of its
welfare programs, prisons and higher education institutions to the
state. The downsizing that it recommended was a foreshadowing of
the reduced government services of the present.
</P>
<P>
   After he resigned from the bench, he joined the law firm of
Donovan, Leisure, Newton &AMP; Irvine, where he had started as a lawyer
in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled throughout his career by the rundown conditions of
courthouses, he once described the Bronx County Courthouse as
having ``filth and squalor of which are surpassed only by some
chapters out of Dickens novels, or perhaps by the conditions of an
18th-century sailing ship.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, he formed a committee of lawyers to contribute
money to redo the flaking, peeling murals painted on the inside of
the State Supreme Courthouse dome.
</P>
<P>
   At home, his wife said, he rarely talked of work. ``His passions
were Shakespeare and Churchill and his family.'' Well into his 80s,
he continued to work on keeping himself in shape. As a judge, he
kept a chinning bar in his office. Until about two years ago, he
rode a bicycle. ``My mother took my bike away,'' he would say after
his wife asked him to quit after a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be organized about life,'' she remembered him
saying often. When he bought a table at a dinner, he would ``place
and replace the cards 92 times,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Joan
Morgan McGivern, of Upper Montclair, N.J., Tara Lynn, of New York
City; three sons, Owen, of New York City, Thomas, of San Francisco,
and Morgan, of East Hampton, N.Y.; and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, Mrs. McGivern said, he planned every
detail of his funeral: a low Mass with no incense; a eulogy by one
daughter and one son, not to exceed five minutes each; the singing
of two hymns, ``Amazing Grace'' and ``A Mighty Fortress Is Our
God,'' followed by a reception at the Union Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was afraid I wouldn't get it quite right,'' she said. ``He
would say, `You can't leave it to chance.' ''

 GUILTY PLEA EXPECTED IN DEATH OF NEWBORN AT PROM  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT HANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rather than risk a murder conviction and life in prison, the New
Jersey teen-ager accused of killing her newborn son at her senior
prom 13 months ago has decided to plead guilty to a lesser charge,
a person familiar with the case said.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of plea negotiations, the teen-ager, Melissa
Drexler, of Forked River, has agreed to plead guilty to a charge of
aggravated manslaughter in exchange for the prosecutor's
recommendation that she serve no more than 15 years in prison, said
the person familiar with the case, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Drexler, now 19, is expected to enter the plea Thursday
morning before Judge John Ricciardi of New Jersey Superior Court in
Freehold, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Her court appearance would coincide, by chance, with the
sentencing in Delaware on the same day of Amy Grossberg and Brian
Peterson, the two 19-year-old former sweethearts from Wyckoff,
N.J., who are the principals in another widely publicized case of
suburban teen-agers accused of killing their newborns. Both Ms.
Grossberg and Peterson have pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the
death of their infant son at a motel near Ms. Grossberg's dormitory
at the University of Delaware in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware's sentencing guidelines suggest a 30-month prison term
for first-time offenders who plead guilty to manslaughter. But the
sentencing judge, Henry duPont Ridgely of Delaware Superior Court,
is not bound by the guidelines and is free to impose anything up to
the maximum possible term, 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage of proceedings against the three teen-agers, it
seems possible that Ms. Drexler could receive a stiffer jail
sentence than Ms. Grossberg or Peterson, even though New Jersey
prosecutors were more lenient than their Delaware counterparts in
the early handling of the cases. The New Jersey charge is the more
serious, and the minimum possible penalty in the New Jersey case is
10 years, the same as the maximum in the Delaware case.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of Ms. Grossberg's and Peterson's arrests, officials
in the Delaware attorney general's office talked openly about the
possibility of seeking the death penalty. In New Jersey, on the
other hand, John Kaye, the Monmouth County prosecutor, ruled out
seeking the death penalty for Ms. Drexler, characterizing her as a
``frightened young kid'' at the time of the birth. She is accused
of either strangling or suffocating her newborn son after
delivering him in a bathroom stall at her prom on June 6, 1997. She
was under ``extreme mental or emotional disturbance,'' Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware prosecutors have not publicly discussed Ms. Grossberg's
mental state. Although they eventually softened their talk about a
death penalty, calling it one of several sentencing options, the
possibility was not formally eliminated until the state dropped a
murder charge against her in early April, three weeks after
Peterson pleaded guilty to manslaughter and agreed to testify
against her. Ms. Grossberg soon agreed to plead guilty to the same
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye has said Ms. Drexler's case was the fourth infanticide he
has prosecuted in 16 years in office. In the others, he eventually
allowed the mothers to plead guilty to lesser charges, including
aggravated manslaughter in two of the cases and manslaughter in the
other.
</P>
<P>
   A murder conviction in New Jersey carries a life sentence with
no chance of parole before 30 years. Aggravated manslaughter is the
state's second most serious homicide charge and carries a penalty
of 10 to 30 years. During the plea bargaining, Ms. Drexler pressed
for a limit to her sentence, and Kaye agreed to propose 15 years,
the person familiar with the case said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey law does not require a minimum sentence for those
convicted of aggravated manslaughter. Generally, a convict becomes
eligible for parole after serving a third of the sentence. If Ms.
Drexler is sentenced to 15 years, parole hearings could start after
she serves five years.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye and his top aides have refused to discuss Ms. Drexler's
case, other than to say that she will appear in court Thursday and
that Kaye will hold a news conference afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Steven Secare, declined through an office assistant
to comment.

LINING UP FOR HUGS FROM A GURU OF TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The line of people seated crosslegged on the floor
snaked the length of the Universalist Church on Central Park West
on Tuesday, as young and old, healthy and infirm waited their turn
for a hug from a sari-clad woman with a diamond in her nose.
</P>
<P>
   But it was no ordinary hug of affection that drew admirers from
Manhattan's Upper West Side to California to Colombia to Mata
Amritandandamayi, an Indian guru whose name means ``mother of
immortal bliss.'' Rather, she enveloped her admirers in much the
way a mother comforts her crying child. But her hug is meant to
impart divine inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   As individuals or family groups, her followers laid their heads
in her lap for the hug, accompanied by a back massage and blessings
spoken gently into their ears. Always she ended by throwing rose
petals at the supplicants and giving them Hershey's Kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Commonly known as Amma or Ammachi or simply Ma, the 43-year old
woman rose from an impoverished childhood in southern India to
become a ``living saint'' in her homeland. She has established or
inspired the organization of hospitals, schools, orphanages and
hospitals there and soup kitchens in the United States. Funds for
Amma's projects are raised from donors and from the sale of books,
recordings, jewelry and clothing at her hugging sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay Amma, stay Amma, stay Amma, please stay,'' a young man
wept Tuesday into her lap. But even as she comforted him, she could
not fulfill his wish. Her three-day visit to New York, part of a
nine-city tour of the nation, ends with two sessions Wednesday. By
then she will have hugged thousands.
</P>
<P>
   She never seems to tire. Speaking in Malayalam, the language of
her native state, Kerala, and translated by her chief disciple,
Swami Amritaswarup, she said, ``People's happiness is my rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a poor fisherman in southern India, she was said
to have been born with a bluish hue to her skin and became an
outcast. Her father withdrew her from school in the fourth grade
and she was made to serve as a family slave.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, ``I had direct experience with the suffering of
others and visited neighboring elderly, sick and starving,'' she
said. ``I always wanted to know the cause of misery and thought if
sorrow is a truth then there must be a cause and a way out. I
realized my purpose is to console, to personally wipe away tears
through selfless love, compassion and service.''
</P>
<P>
   Though brought up a Hindu, she does not believe in the supremacy
of any single religion. ``Love is a universal religion and what
society really needs,'' she said. ``Religion is just a means and
once you attain that goal, you don't need the means.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the line and in the pews agreed, saying that they were
seeking a spirituality that is broader than any single set of
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought up as a nice Jewish girl, celebrating the
holidays,'' said Holly Liebman, a yoga teacher from Dobbs Ferry,
N.Y., who now uses the first name Brahmani. ``I still celebrate the
holidays, but this has brought me back to honoring all
traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman named Janani gave up her given name, Beverley Noia, and
her possessions to follow Amma and live in her ashram in the
village of Vallickau. She said: ``All religions are there. We come
around her because this is how God's word comes through in the 20th
and 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Janani, who is 53, accompanies Amma on all her travels.
``Before, I had everything I ever dreamed of,'' Janani said. ``I
was a teacher in a prep school in Denver and at a university and
had tenure. I had a Victorian house in the city, a weekend house in
the mountains and a camper. People say to me, `What a sacrifice you
have made.' I answer, `What a sacrifice it would be not to do
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though Amma is not considered a faith healer, some people say
that she can alleviate physical illness. ``She has done miracles
for my child,'' said Sadhana Barriere, who lifted her blind
6-year-old son, Prasad, who has cerebral palsy and epilepsy, into
Amma's lap for a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to have 400 seizures a day,'' Ms. Barriere said.
``After he saw her it went to twice a week and then to once every
seven months.''
</P>
<P>
   When Paula Lajaunie, the director of Tibetan rug shop in SoHo,
left the church, she said: ``My reaction is very mixed. The kernel
of the experience was very deep. I could feel her deep love but I
am a spiritual seeker so there was not anything done here that I
haven't experienced in deep meditation.''
</P>
<P>
   German Castillos, an import-export company executive who
traveled from Bogota to persuade Amma to come to Colombia, had no
such reservations. ``We need someone spiritually powerful to give
us lessons,'' he said. ``We need love and compassion to see if we
can get out of violence, drugs, criminality. That is the only
salvation for us.''
</P>
<P>
   For Anthony McShane and his partner, Pamela LaFrance, who live
in Cooperstown, N.Y., the encounter seemed some sort of epiphany
and they sat weeping in a pew afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even know she existed till a month ago,'' Ms.
LaFrance said. ``Now I am more peaceful than I can express. Being
in her arms was like being a baby who totally loses herself in her
mother's arms.''
</P>
<P>
   McShane, who owns a shop specializing in spiritual books in
Oneonta, N.Y., nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something was released,'' he said. ``I feel I don't deserve
what I've gotten. I don't even know what it is, but honey, I know
you can't buy it.''

MAN CONVICTED IN COSBY DEATH; FACES LIFE TERM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf to delete reference to Ennis Cosby's mother being
present in court and for other changes throughout. Adds four grafs
at end of story.)  (sw) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A jury took less than six hours on Tuesday to find
19-year-old Mikail Markhasev guilty of murdering Ennis Cosby, the
son of the entertainer Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   Markhasev smiled briefly in the packed courtroom as the verdict
was read, then he stood expressionless as the slain man's sisters
hugged each other and began to sob.
</P>
<P>
   Markhasev was found guilty of first-degree murder and attempted
robbery in the death of Cosby, who was fatally shot in an apparent
robbery while changing a flat tire on Jan. 16, 1997. Markhasev
could receive a term of life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Judge David Perez of Superior Court in Santa Monica scheduled
the sentencing for Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   While prosecutors lauded the verdict, Henry Hall, one of the two
public defenders who represented Markhasev, said at a news
conference afterward that he believed that the intense publicity
and the fame of Cosby's father had turned attention away from a
sober analysis of the evidence and had brought about an unfair
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the jury had not been directly tainted and that ``the
celebrity of the Cosby family, I don't think, had a direct impact
on the trial.'' But he also insisted, ``The societal presumption
was that there would be a conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Ingalls, the deputy district attorney who prosecuted the
case, disputed Hall's assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the jury was extremely responsible in what they
did,'' Ms. Ingalls said. ``I think that the evidence convicted Mr.
Markhasev. I think that Mr. Markhasev convicted Mr. Markhasev and
not the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cosby attended the trial for the first time on Monday, the
day the closing arguments concluded. He was there with his wife,
Camille, and his daughters Erika and Erinn.
</P>
<P>
   While Cosby's daughters were in court on Tuesday, he and his
wife were not, but through a spokesman he issued a statement after
the verdict was read, saying, ``The Cosby family is satisfied with
the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   Ennis Cosby was 27 and a doctoral student in education at
Columbia University when he was shot in the head while changing a
flat tire alongside a Los Angeles highway in the early morning of
Jan. 16, 1997. The police said it appeared to have been an
unplanned but botched robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the entirely circumstantial nature of the prosecution's
case, which relied on a hair found with the murder weapon, letters
handed over by a man facing unrelated forgery charges and a tip to
The National Enquirer, the jury seemed to have dispatched quickly
with Markhasev's defense that a friend of his had actually shot
Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   In the letters that prosecutors said Markhasev wrote after his
arrest to the forgery suspect and others, he referred to the Cosby
killing as a ``robbery gone bad.'' DNA evidence showed that the
hair, found inside a cap wrapped around the murder weapon, was
almost certainly Markhasev's. And Christopher So, who was paid
$40,000 by The National Enquirer for interviews and stands to get a
$100,000 reward from the newspaper if Markhasev is convicted,
testified that Markhasev had said he shot a black man, and that
``it's all over the news.''
</P>
<P>
   But Markhasev's mother testified that her son had been with her
the night of the murder and his lawyers had argued that the
incriminating letters had been forged.
</P>
<P>
   The trial began with several claims that were ultimately
unsubstantiated. Early in the trial the prosecution had made the
claim that Markhasev was a member of a notorious prison gang, the
Mexican Mafia, and Markhasev's lawyers had said they would prove
that Eli Zakaria, a friend of Markhasev, had committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Neither assertion was proved. Ultimately, the case boiled down
to the accidental and ultimately tragic crossing of the paths of
the two young men, one who had done reasonably well in school after
immigrating here from Ukraine before sliding into a life of crime,
and the other apparently working hard to build a career as an
educator out of the shadow of his wealthy and famous father.
</P>
<P>
   Markhasev was arrested in March 1997 after a highly publicized
police search following what appeared from the start to have been a
senseless crime. Cosby had apparently been driving his father's
Mercedes-Benz to visit a friend when the car got a flat tire. He
pulled off the highway at a quiet spot and called the friend to
help him change the tire.
</P>
<P>
   The friend, Stephanie Crane, showed up and was threatened by a
man who came up to the window of her car. She fled and came back
minutes later to find Mr. Cosby dead, she testified.
</P>
<P>
   The police used her description to create a sketch of the
murderer, but they were unable to make an arrest until The National
Enquirer received a tip from So, a friend of Markhasev, who hoped
to get the reward.
</P>
<P>
   So said that two days after the murder Markhasev took him and a
friend to a field where Markhasev said he had thrown the gun. So
said they tried to find the gun but could not. So later led the
police to the field, where they found a .38-caliber handgun,
wrapped in the knit cap. Ballistic tests later showed the weapon
had been used to kill Cosby. Markhasev was arrested and charged
with the crime shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Markhasev never took the witness stand. His lawyers argued that
the witnesses against him were motivated by greed and a desire to
receive more favorable treatment from the police in unrelated
charges that each of them faced. They also insisted that Zakaria,
who had been with Markhasev on the night of the murder, was the
actual killer.
</P>
<P>
   Zakaria was called to testify, but he refused, citing his Fifth
Amendment right against forced self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution insisted there was nothing to support this
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence that Eli Zakaria had been involved in
this,'' Ms. Ingalls said at the news conference.

BIRMINGHAM URGES SIGNING BONUSES FOR TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham proposed Tuesday
using part of the newly &UR;  &LR; realized budget surplus to entice new
teachers with whopping $20,000 signing bonuses, by far the largest
of any school system in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would be the state's most dramatic step toward
raising teaching, which some consider a virtual vow of poverty, to
the ranks of a respectable _ and remunerative _ profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never going to pay teachers what corporate lawyers get,
but that doesn't mean you can't do something to attract better
people,'' Birmingham said. ``The convergence of the teacher
training debate and the budget surplus is a convenient one.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a small number of school districts across the
country have offered small signing bonuses as a way of luring
prospective teachers. Dallas enticed 200 teachers this spring with
$1,500 bonuses. Baltimore offers new teachers $5,000 toward a new
house.
</P>
<P>
   But Birmingham's proposal would set up the fattest rewards. The
$20,000 carrot would rival the signing bonuses high-powered
financial companies are paying out to new recruits; at Cornell
University, the average signing bonus for an MBA this spring was
$17,500.
</P>
<P>
   While more money isn't the only way to better teachers,
Birmingham says, it would go a long way toward doing what many say
is necessary: make smart college graduates see teaching as an
esteemed profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-thousand dollars is a big hunk of money, and it's going
to get people's attention,'' said Elizabeth Fideler, vice president
for policy and research for the Recruiting New Teachers, a national
non-profit group based in Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``States aren't competing just with one another, they're
competing with other fields. This is the kind of thing that can tip
the career decision for someone who's weighing teaching against
another field,'' Fideler said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, ``I'd hate to think this is going to be $20,000
for a warm body to sign up. I'd like to think there would be some
qualifications involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's schools are fighting for quality as well as
quantity as they face the replacement of 2 million of their 2.7
million teachers over the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The results of Massachusetts' first teacher test _ in which 59
percent of prospective teachers could not pass a basic skills
portion _ raised concerns about low qualifications of teachers in
Massachusetts, but a range of studies before that had chronicled
the same dismal news nationwide: Prospective teachers have poorer
grades in high school, lower SAT scores going into college, and
lower grade-point averages than students entering other
professions.
</P>
<P>
   The field has suffered in quality as more lucrative careers have
become available for women, the traditional backbone of the
profession.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The average starting teacher salary in Massachusetts is
$26,000, compared with an average of at least $35,000 in all other
professions, according to the state department of education.
Salaries rise to about $60,000, but studies show that in recruiting
better teachers, it's more important to have high salaries at the
entry level to the profession.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 15,000 teachers documented in his book, ``Who Will
Teach,'' Harvard economist and education professor Richard Murnane
found that as teachers stayed longer in the profession, they cared
less about how much money they earned. Yet, low salaries often
deterred talented graduates from going into teaching in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   The state already has a program to forgive the student loans of
top college graduates who go into teaching. But candidates can get
only $7,200 in loan forgiveness, and state officials widely admit
the program has not been as successful as they hoped when it was
set up by the 1993 Education Reform Act. One-thousand people have
entered through the program, but last year the state spent only
about half the money the Legislature had set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham, a co-author of the reform act, said that the loan
forgiveness appealed to people already interested in teaching. He
hoped the signing bonuses would attract college students who would
go into other professions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the signing bonus has to be reasonably generous,''
he said. ``If it's only $1,000, it's not going to significantly
change the behavior of a significant number of people. Some people
will not have a lifetime career, others will have a rewarding
experience and stay. In any event, we'll have some talented people,
who otherwise would not go into teaching, for at least some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who study teacher recruitment and training say the way to
a better teaching force is to improve training. States need to
convince people from other professions to bring their expertise to
the classroom. And they note that teachers, if they can't expect
high salaries, often report higher intrinsic rewards than more
lucrative fields.
</P>
<P>
   But still, they agree, states won't get better teachers without
offering them more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a function of whether the work is worth it, it's a
function of being able to compete in the labor market,'' said
Richard Elmore, professor of education at Harvard. ``The part of
the labor market which was willing to supply high quality work for
less money isn't there. Entering salaries in particular need to
reflect the competition for talent.''
</P>
<P>
   While Birmingham's proposal would require the approval of the
Legislature and the governor, several observers Tuesday said it
would do well in the current climate. The teacher-testing debacle
has set off a frenzy of attacks and calls to action: Birmingham's
counterpart in the House, Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, condemned
teachers as ``idiots,'' and Acting Governor Paul Cellucci demanded
that teachers take the test and be fired if they fail.
</P>
<P>
   While Birmingham said the details were yet to be worked out, he
proposed setting up a trust fund with $100 million of the budget
surplus. Even with a modest yield, he said, that fund would earn $5
million in interest the first year, or enough to pay for 250
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Where such programs exist, they have seen teachers of a broader
and better range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten inquiries from all over the country,'' said
Phillip Peregrine, chief of human resources for the Fort Worth
Independent School District, which lured about 200 teachers with
bonuses of between $500 and $2,000. ``It's been attractive to
people, and we've absolutely gotten a better pool.''

STATE BOARD TO CONSIDER NAME CHANGE FOR SQUAW PEAK
</HEADLINE>
   By RUBEN NAVARETTE JR.  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX _ A little-known state board Wednesday will consider
changing the name of one of Phoenix's best-known land marks from
Squaw Peak to Iron Mountain.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But even if the Arizona Board of Geographic and Historical Names
adopts the new name, which is the English translation of the Akimel
O'odham word for the site, the names of the Squaw Peak Parkway and
other sites would not change.
</P>
<P>
   The board, intent on not involving itself in what has become, at
times, a heated public debate over the word's offensiveness, is not
going to allow any public comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be discussing whether the word is offensive,'' Norton
said.
</P>
<P>
   But others disagree with that approach and claim that the board
cannot divorce itself from the con troversy that produced the
proposal in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't say that this isn't political,'' said Michele
Curran, a historian hired by the American Indian Movement. ``It's
all politi cal.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal before the board has its origins in a public
campaign by a pair of teenage girls to expunge ``squaw'' from the
Arizona vernac ular.
</P>
<P>
   Delena Waddle and Siepe Flood, both 17, were inspired by a
success ful movement in Minnesota in 1995 to remove ``squaw'' from
place names in that state. After research ing the origin of the
word, Waddle and Flood concluded that it was offensive and sexually
explicit, den oting female genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   In July of 1997, Waddle and Flood petitioned the nine-member
board to change the name of Squaw Peak, which had been known as
Iron Mountain until 1910.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has to take a look at the research, the historical
origins of the word, and weigh public senti ment on the issue and
then decide,'' said board chairman Tim Norton.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said that, despite rumors to the contrary, renaming the
moun tain after late U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater was not possible.
Federal regulations require that an individ ual be dead for at
least five years before something can be named after him.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater died in May and would not eligible for such a state
honor until 2003, Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Deep passion has long sur rounded the name-change issue.
</P>
<P>
   For Waddle, the passing of time has not changed her mind that
``squaw'' is a word that wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know why we want to change it,'' she said. ``I just hope
they see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddle brushed aside claims by some that other Native Americans
do not object to the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten tons of support from Indian people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And some of that support has come from people who initially saw
nothing wrong with the term.
</P>
<P>
   ``That word has been around forever,'' said Leona Kakar, Ak-Chin
tribal chairwoman. ``We didn't care before because we really didn't
know what it meant in another language.''
</P>
<P>
   Kakar said that since she became aware of just how strongly the
word is objected to by tribes in other parts of the country,
especially in the Midwest and Northeast, she has become more
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is an offensive word to other tribes, then we would also
be opposed to it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For others, charges that there is dissension in the Native
American community on the issue are reminis cent of a familiar
strategy of undermining Indian unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just divide and conquer,'' said Lisa Foster, a Lakota
whose husband, Vernon, is director of AIM's southwest region.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Foster also faults Native American people for breaking
ranks too easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stuck together, we'd have a stronger voice.'' &QL;

<P>
   SAN BENITO, Texas _ A young man armed with military assault
rifles killed a mother and daughter, and then fatally shot two
Border Patrol agents pursuing him here Tuesday, law-enforcement
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials say the shootings in the lower Rio Grande valley,
in which the gunman died and a local sheriff's deputy was seriously
wounded, illustrates the growing risks Border Patrol agents face in
a territory transformed into a combat zone as officers pursue drug
smugglers, as well as people moving illegal immigrants across the
border.
</P>
<P>
   The ranks of the Border Patrol have swollen to fight these
crimes and now its agents are also summoned to aid the local
authorities in other situations.
</P>
<P>
   A suspect, Ernest Moore, 24, was also wounded in the shootout
and died early Tuesday night at Valley Baptist Medical Center in
Harlingen, the police said, adding that he was the son of a police
officer in Harlingen, a larger city northwest of San Benito.
</P>
<P>
   The two agents, one of whom is the first woman slain while on
duty, were the third and fourth to die this year. Eighty-one agents
have died in the Border Patrol's 74-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Meissner, the head of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the agency that oversees the Border Patrol, said at a
local news conference that she had attended a service for another
slain agent only a month ago. ``I had hoped that it would be the
last,'' she said. ``Now, so soon, two more courageous and heroic
officers have fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   While the greatest risk to agents usually lies along the border,
they are increasingly being summoned by local police and sheriff's
departments.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:20 Tuesday morning, deputies in the Cameron County
Sheriff's Department investigated a report that shots had been
fired in Rio Hondo, another Harlingen suburb. Sheriff Omar Lucio
said they had found Margarita Flores, 53, and one of her daughters,
Delia Morin, dead, and her son seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said later that Moore had been looking for a
woman staying in Ms. Flores' home. Leaving behind what deputies
said was an AK-47 assault rifle, he fled before dawn in a white
pickup truck, in which he was seen with two other men after the
shootings at the house. The authorities are investigating whether
those men also played a role in the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the Border Patrol, deputies spotted the pickup
about a half-hour later in the driveway of a San Benito house the
police said Moore had shared with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies and agents were searching the home and then the
nearby cornfields, when they heard rifle fire. Ricardo Salinas, 24,
a Border Patrol trainee, and Susan Rodriguez, a 28-year-old agent,
were fatally wounded. Officers later found an AR-15, a civilian
version of the M-16 assault rifle used by the military.
</P>
<P>
   After taking Moore into custody, more than 150 law-enforcement
officials combed the fields and dusty roads for the two men spotted
in the truck. In 100-degree heat, assault teams from several
federal, state and local agencies advanced in helmets and flak
jackets, as a helicopter whirred overhead. Even the police from
Edinburg, a nearby city, rumbled up in an armored vehicle.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By early afternoon, the officers began wrapping up their search,
saying they had scoured the area and would pursue other leads.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded deputy, Raul Rodriguez, 32, was in critical
condition at Valley Baptist Medical Center. The wounded brother,
Danny Morin, 22, was reported to be in serious condition at the
same hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said that they had no reason believe
that drugs were involved in the disputes, and that the suspect
appeared to have no criminal record.

OLYMPIC BID FOR ARLINGTON REMAINS ALIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now, they were supposed to be out of the Olympic business.
</P>
<P>
   Snickered out of the U.S. Olympic Committee meetings. Made to
look homely. And sent to their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But the garbage guy with the Olympic dream, Grady Hicks, just
won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Au contraire, in fact. The unflappable Mr. Hicks charged through
one USOC deadline last week and eagerly awaits another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, even more so,'' Hicks said yesterday, when asked if he was
just as enthused now as he was last fall about an Arlington area
Olympic bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fantastic thing for our area.''
</P>
<P>
   In true Olympic spirit, Hicks sounds determined to go the
distance _ or, like the legendary Phidippides, keel over at the
finish line.
</P>
<P>
   What sounded like a frivolous publicity stunt nine months ago
took another conspicuous step last week by meeting the USOC
deadline for formalizing its bid committee and having it recognized
as a nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Arlington-Fort Worth-Dallas group was joined by similar
dreamers from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Tampa,
Cincinnati and Baltimore-Washington. They all are competing to be
the U.S. bid city for the 2012 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   To give credit where due, it should be noted that Hicks and his
committeemen have impressively done their homework. They have read
the 80 pounds of binders and etiquette books that the USOC has
issued them.
</P>
<P>
   They can now talk the talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dallas-Fort Worth area has the best base _ corporately _
of all the bid cities to pull off an Olympics,'' said Dallas' Ken
Luce, who is helping serve as the group's spokesman. ``You look at
Penney's, NationsBank, American Airlines, Pier One, Tandy. They are
all based here. And that's our biggest asset, by far.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine months ago, alas, the Arlington group didn't have any
assets. It had a receipt for Hicks' six-figure bid deposit. It had
a couple of handshakes. It had a roll of the eyes from the USOC
people, who tried hard to take Hicks' bid seriously.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond that, it didn't have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of bid-city seminars, workshops and Olympic
protocol cramming sessions seem to have turned Hicks and Luce into
deft Olympi-bidders.
</P>
<P>
   They can talk the talk. But can they walk the walk?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people in this area realize that we're only a
couple of facilities short of being able to host a major sports
festival right now,'' Luce said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, true. Sort of. But one of those ``facilities'' would have
to be a $200 million-plus stadium for track and field and the
opening and closing ceremonies. Somebody would have to pay for that
_ Dallas? Fort Worth? Arlington?
</P>
<P>
   But Luce's greater point is that the Olympic idea isn't all
half-baked. Again, they've done their homework. The notion of
recruiting the area's corporate community to aid in the bid would
give the Arlington group an advantage that most of the other
bidders can't match.
</P>
<P>
   Without Coca-Cola, would Atlanta have gotten the 1996 Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   A good question. But the fact is that with Coke, Atlanta did.
</P>
<P>
   Amusingly, the Arlington bid committee still exists in briefcase
form only. They plan to open a real office in September, but in the
meantime, the workbooks, mail and phone calls are being shuffled
between Hicks' office and periodic committee meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The idea won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Douglas of the Dallas Chamber of Commerce has met with the
committee and has been quietly working to gather support of the
corporate community. The next step _ a major one, as far as the
USOC is concerned _ would be a formal endorsement from the Dallas
mayor's office. It likely will come by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   And then what?
</P>
<P>
   It has been written and suggested that Atlanta schmoozed its way
to the '96 Games. The Atlanta bid people unfurled a provocative red
carpet for visiting International Olympic Committee members.
</P>
<P>
   Wining and dining, Luce shrugged, is right up this area's alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people in this town who would be very good
at that,'' Luce said.
</P>
<P>
   They have done their homework. Hicks wisely spoke yesterday
about the ample consolation prizes that are out there for cities
who don't make the USOC's final cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to stop tomorrow dead in our tracks,'' Hicks said,
``what this has done for our area is fantastic. Every one of the
amateur sports federations across the country know the Dallas-Fort
Worth area now. They know we're an Olympic-bid city.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know we're a player now for some of their best events.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, indeed, sounded even more enthusiastic than the naive
soul who unveiled his Olympic dream last autumn.
</P>
<P>
   At USOC headquarters in Colorado, they're not rolling their eyes
anymore. To them, Arlington is like Cincinnati, which is like San
Francisco, which is like all the other eight cities who dream of
holding the 2012 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Stunning as that may sound here, that's a major step.

DISSENT WITHIN NCAA BECOMES EASY TO SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Construction is under way on the NCAA's new offices in
Indianapolis, which are scheduled to open in August 1999. But
cracks are beginning to show in the collegiate sports
organization's figurative foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the NCAA has been around for a century, there has
been talk like that before, that the association is falling
apart,'' NCAA president Cedric Dempsey said. ``And historically,
the NCAA has adapted and moved on. All of these recent occurrences
shouldn't be construed as everything is falling apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this is the summer of the organization's
discontent.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has settled a lawsuit with basketball coach Jerry
Tarkanian (price: $2.5 million); lost a lawsuit concerning
restricted earnings for basketball assistant coaches (price: $67
million, under appeal); and has reached an agreement with the U.S.
Justice Department regarding admissions of student-athletes with
learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a controversial rule that allows student-athletes
to work and earn up to $2,000 during the school year goes into
effect Aug. 1. And, the NCAA is considering proposals to lower SAT
and American College Test scores for initial eligibility for
freshmen athletes. This after spending a decade enacting
legislation requiring higher test scores.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's new governance structure is less than a year old, but
already is being fitted for a new suit. Designed to streamline the
legislative process, several commissioners and athletic directors
have registered vocal complaints about the new system's
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   And there continues to be rumbling that 60 to 80 elite
football-playing Division I schools will secede from the union and
form their own college sports organization.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it appears the NCAA's lists of negatives far
outweigh the positives.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these things came to a head at the same time, but
were not related to each other at all,'' Dempsey said. ``I think
there are a lot of positives and I think we have a structure in
place that will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissent within the organization is not hard to find, however.
</P>
<P>
   Big Ten Conference commissioner Jim Delany believes that the
NCAA has become too cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have reasonable and defensible rules to give us
structure,'' he said. ``We don't need rules that are as extensive
as they are now. We need rules regarding the number of
scholarships, coaches, games, decipherable recruiting rules, some
minimum academic standards. We don't need micro-management.''
</P>
<P>
   Division I-A schools _ the major football programs _ in the big
conferences want more control and say over the legislation that
directly affects them. That, along with the splitting of the
16-team Western Athletic Conference, has some envisioning a
Darwinian evolution in the upper echelon of college sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been a certain survival of the fittest issues
in intercollegiate athletics,'' Texas A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen said.
``The importance of TV revenue as we try to manage our budgets may
continue to create problems for some schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds is more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere, somehow there's going to be a Division IV or
something, a weeding out of Division I-A,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinning out, expansion, controversy are a part of any
meaningful organization,'' said Syracuse Chancellor Kenneth Shaw,
chair of the Division I board of directors. ``By that standard the
NCAA must be a very meaningful organization. ... There will always
be rumors of members bolting.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotions have been stirred within the NCAA because of the
restricted-earnings ruling and frustration about the new governance
structure.
</P>
<P>
   If the NCAA fails in the appeals process in the
restricted-earnings case _ and it plans to take it to the Supreme
Court if necessary _ Division I schools will foot the bill. It
could cost each school between $200,000 to $300,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Delany said the NCAA should learn from what went wrong with the
restricted-earnings case.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, the membership should get the strong message that you
can't solve every problem legislatively,'' Delany said. ``Two, the
NCAA staff leadership, lawyers, need to do a better job of
filtering out and advising on rules that could have consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third, I think we need to re-examine the NCAA function. What
can it do that conferences do not? Conferences can't do our own
enforcement and we can't stage national championships. We need the
NCAA to provide a forum for reasonable recruiting and academic
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The restricted-earnings rule was passed during an NCAA
Convention, a delight for Roberts Rules of Order fans but a
confusing and unwieldy vehicle for rule-making. The new governance
structure has eliminated the convention as a rules-making entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of our people believe it's working quite well,
but they're finding it's hard to keep up with the flow of
legislation,'' Pacific-10 commissioner Tom Hansen said. ``I know
some people are frustrated, but there are more people involved with
things than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten away from 3,000 people sitting in a ballroom
trying to write sentences in legislation. That wasn't working.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the new structure in service less than a year, several
college sports leaders are frustrated with how it functions.
Difficulties in tracking legislation and changes to legislation are
the most common complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restructuring is a work in progress,'' Shaw said. ``For any
viable social institution, that is the case. We will always be
getting suggestions for improvement. All will be taken seriously.
Good suggestions will be dealt with _ and the process guarantees
that all will be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA, which has about $3 million budgeted for the upcoming
year for legal fees, plans on retaining a law firm that specializes
in anti-trust legislation. The restricted-earnings ruling was based
on anti-trust rulings and there is thought that the rule allowing
student-athletes to work but capping their income also could be
vulnerable to an anti-trust suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering what we've been through recently, we're concerned
about all of our legislation,'' Dempsey said, referring to the
NCAA's strategy for legal aid.
</P>
<P>
   After a string of court victories that extended through three
decades, the NCAA is on a losing streak. The defeats have hurt the
organization's image, which has always been hazy. As Dempsey points
out, the NCAA is merely an organization of 933 schools whose
representatives make up the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the concept of the NCAA has a big-spending, rule-making,
probation-rendering Big Brother lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey recently received a raise of about $150,000. With the
restricted-earnings settlement looming and athletic departments
struggling to make financial ends meet in this era of Title IX
equity, Dempsey's $650,000 salary raises eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the NCAA has hired a public-relations firm to affirm
the organization's image and to put a positive spin on the news the
NCAA considers good.

</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the NCAA has been around for a century, there has
been talk like that before, that the association is falling
apart,'' NCAA president Cedric Dempsey said. ``And historically,
the NCAA has adapted and moved on. All of these recent occurrences
shouldn't be construed as everything is falling apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this is the summer of the organization's
discontent.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has settled a lawsuit with basketball coach Jerry
Tarkanian (price: $2.5 million); lost a lawsuit concerning
restricted earnings for basketball assistant coaches (price: $67
million, under appeal); and has reached an agreement with the U.S.
Justice Department regarding admissions of student-athletes with
learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a controversial rule that allows student-athletes
to work and earn up to $2,000 during the school year goes into
effect Aug. 1. And, the NCAA is considering proposals to lower SAT
and American College Test scores for initial eligibility for
freshmen athletes. This after spending a decade enacting
legislation requiring higher test scores.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's new governance structure is less than a year old, but
already is being fitted for a new suit. Designed to streamline the
legislative process, several commissioners and athletic directors
have registered vocal complaints about the new system's
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   And there continues to be rumbling that 60 to 80 elite
football-playing Division I schools will secede from the union and
form their own college sports organization.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it appears the NCAA's lists of negatives far
outweigh the positives.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these things came to a head at the same time, but
were not related to each other at all,'' Dempsey said. ``I think
there are a lot of positives and I think we have a structure in
place that will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissent within the organization is not hard to find, however.
</P>
<P>
   Big Ten Conference commissioner Jim Delany believes that the
NCAA has become too cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have reasonable and defensible rules to give us
structure,'' he said. ``We don't need rules that are as extensive
as they are now. We need rules regarding the number of
scholarships, coaches, games, decipherable recruiting rules, some
minimum academic standards. We don't need micro-management.''
</P>
<P>
   Division I-A schools _ the major football programs _ in the big
conferences want more control and say over the legislation that
directly affects them. That, along with the splitting of the
16-team Western Athletic Conference, has some envisioning a
Darwinian evolution in the upper echelon of college sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been a certain survival of the fittest issues
in intercollegiate athletics,'' Texas A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen said.
``The importance of TV revenue as we try to manage our budgets may
continue to create problems for some schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds is more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere, somehow there's going to be a Division IV or
something, a weeding out of Division I-A,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinning out, expansion, controversy are a part of any
meaningful organization,'' said Syracuse Chancellor Kenneth Shaw,
chair of the Division I board of directors. ``By that standard the
NCAA must be a very meaningful organization. ... There will always
be rumors of members bolting.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotions have been stirred within the NCAA because of the
restricted-earnings ruling and frustration about the new governance
structure.
</P>
<P>
   If the NCAA fails in the appeals process in the
restricted-earnings case _ and it plans to take it to the Supreme
Court if necessary _ Division I schools will foot the bill. It
could cost each school between $200,000 to $300,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Delany said the NCAA should learn from what went wrong with the
restricted-earnings case.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, the membership should get the strong message that you
can't solve every problem legislatively,'' Delany said. ``Two, the
NCAA staff leadership, lawyers, need to do a better job of
filtering out and advising on rules that could have consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third, I think we need to re-examine the NCAA function. What
can it do that conferences do not? Conferences can't do our own
enforcement and we can't stage national championships. We need the
NCAA to provide a forum for reasonable recruiting and academic
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The restricted-earnings rule was passed during an NCAA
Convention, a delight for Roberts Rules of Order fans but a
confusing and unwieldy vehicle for rule-making. The new governance
structure has eliminated the convention as a rules-making entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of our people believe it's working quite well,
but they're finding it's hard to keep up with the flow of
legislation,'' Pacific-10 commissioner Tom Hansen said. ``I know
some people are frustrated, but there are more people involved with
things than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten away from 3,000 people sitting in a ballroom
trying to write sentences in legislation. That wasn't working.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the new structure in service less than a year, several
college sports leaders are frustrated with how it functions.
Difficulties in tracking legislation and changes to legislation are
the most common complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restructuring is a work in progress,'' Shaw said. ``For any
viable social institution, that is the case. We will always be
getting suggestions for improvement. All will be taken seriously.
Good suggestions will be dealt with _ and the process guarantees
that all will be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA, which has about $3 million budgeted for the upcoming
year for legal fees, plans on retaining a law firm that specializes
in anti-trust legislation. The restricted-earnings ruling was based
on anti-trust rulings and there is thought that the rule allowing
student-athletes to work but capping their income also could be
vulnerable to an anti-trust suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering what we've been through recently, we're concerned
about all of our legislation,'' Dempsey said, referring to the
NCAA's strategy for legal aid.
</P>
<P>
   After a string of court victories that extended through three
decades, the NCAA is on a losing streak. The defeats have hurt the
organization's image, which has always been hazy. As Dempsey points
out, the NCAA is merely an organization of 933 schools whose
representatives make up the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the concept of the NCAA has a big-spending, rule-making,
probation-rendering Big Brother lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey recently received a raise of about $150,000. With the
restricted-earnings settlement looming and athletic departments
struggling to make financial ends meet in this era of Title IX
equity, Dempsey's $650,000 salary raises eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the NCAA has hired a public-relations firm to affirm
the organization's image and to put a positive spin on the news the
NCAA considers good.

 &HT;    Border Patrol agents ambushed
 &HT;    By Chuck Lindell and Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BENITO, Texas _ A suspect in the predawn slaying of a mother
and daughter ambushed officers from a field of tall corn early
Tuesday, fatally shooting two Border Patrol agents, including the
first female officer slain in the agency's 74-year history.
</P>
<P>
   A sheriff's deputy also was wounded before officers could return
fire, hitting suspect Ernest Moore four times.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 25, of San Benito, died about 10 hours later after
extensive surgery at Valley Baptist Medical Center in Harlingen,
Texas. The Cameron County deputy, Raul Rodriguez, was in stable
condition at Valley Baptist's critical care unit Tuesday night, a
hospital spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to express how saddened we are today,'' said
Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner,
who traveled to Harlingen after the shooting. ``We extend our most
sincere and heartfelt condolences to their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents Susan Lynn Rodriguez and Ricardo Guillermo
Salinas were killed in the surprise attack. Both lived in
Harlingen.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the mother of a 1-year-old girl, would have turned 29
Saturday. She had been an agent almost six years and was married to
an immigration officer. Salinas, 24, had graduated from the Border
Patrol academy in January and was preparing to take a probationary
exam this week. ``This is a very dark day in the history of the
Border Patrol family,'' said Joe Garza, chief of the Border
Patrol's McAllen sector.
</P>
<P>
   The events began at 5:30 a.m. when two women were killed and a
man critically injured about five miles northeast of Harlingen in
the small farming community of Rio Hondo, home to 1,700 people and
two traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Public Safety, Border Patrol and
other agencies, here's what happened:
</P>
<P>
   Moore arrived at the home of Fidencio Jaramillo and Margarita
Flores before sunrise in search of his ex-girlfriend, who had been
a guest in the Flores home. Met at the door by members of the
Flores family, Moore opened fire with an AK-47 assaultrifle,
hitting Margarita Flores, 52, and her daughter, Delia Morin Flores,
31.
</P>
<P>
   Moore threw the semiautomatic weapon aside and fled in a white
pickup. A 911 call summoned police, who arrived a short time later
to find the women dead in the front hallway of their home. It was
Rio Hondo's first murder since 1987, said Carlos Gonzalez, Rio
Hondo police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Jaramillo, married to Margarita Flores for 15 years, was
awakened by the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I got up and went to the hall, I saw my wife and
stepdaughter shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling for his wife's pulse, Jaramillo, 62, learned she was
dead. He then pushed his stepdaughter's 8- and 9-year-old children
out the home's rear window so they would not see their mother's
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Morin, Margarita Flores' 23-year-old son, also was shot
several times, including a bullet to the back that required several
hours of surgery to repair. Morin was in critical condition Tuesday
night at Valley Baptist Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Alerted by Rio Hondo police, a Cameron County sheriff's deputy
spotted Moore's white pickup and began pursuit, reporting there
appeared to be three people in the truck. That report would add a
great deal of confusion over the next several hours.
</P>
<P>
   After a short pursuit, the deputy lost sight of the vehicle and
radioed for help. Three Border Patrol officers joined the search.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 7 a.m., the Border Patrol agents and other
officers arrived at the home owned by Moore's father near San
Benito, about 10 miles south of the Rio Hondo shooting scene. Moore
has lived with his father since 1992, records show.
</P>
<P>
   When officers arrived, they found the white pickup parked
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking to the father, the officers began walking to
their cars when Moore popped up in a nearby field of corn and, from
about 30 to 40 yards away, began firing a .223 semiautomatic rifle.
Border Patrol officers Rodriguez and Salinas were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other officers had arrived by that time, and they returned
fire and wounded the man,'' DPS spokesman Mike Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next seven hours, about 200 law enforcement officers
and two helicopters searched the cornfield and surrounding areas
for two other suspects erroneously reported to be in Moore's
pickup.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, authorities announced the arrest of a second
suspect in the cornfield. Officials later recanted the mistaken
report without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   When the confusion was finally resolved, the search was called
off shortly after 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol spokeswoman Letty Garza said it is common for
agency officers to help other agencies along the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement agencies work very closely with each other
down here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The last on-duty Border Patrol agent killed in Texas was
Jefferson Barr, 33, who was shot near Eagle Pass, about 60
southeast of Del Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Four Border Patrol officers have been killed in the line of duty
this year. Most recently, Border Patrol agent Alexander Kirpnick
was killed June 3 _ shot in the head by a suspected drug smuggler
near the Arizona border town of Nogales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just last month I went to a memorial service,'' said Meissner,
``I had hoped it would also be the last. Now, so soon, two more
courageous and heroic officers have fallen.''

 &HT;    Motorola posts $1.3 billion loss
 &HT;    By Omar Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Motorola Inc. on Tuesday posted a second-quarter
loss after taking a $1.98 billion charge to pay for a large
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., said weak economic
conditions in Asia and the slumping semiconductor market continued
to hurt the company, as revenues fell 7 percent during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Galvin, Motorola's chief executive, said the
negative effect of the Asian crisis would continue for the rest of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   During the second quarter, Motorola had said it would eliminate
15,000 of its 150,000 jobs worldwide to reduce costs. No further
announcements were made on Tuesday, but a spokesman in Austin said
a ``lot of people'' have taken the voluntary severance package the
company is offering. He declined to say how many workers have taken
the package. For the quarter, the company lost $1.3 billion, or
$2.22 per share, compared with a profit of $268 million, or 44
cents per share, in the 1997 second quarter. Revenue for the 1998
quarter was $7 billion, down from $7.5 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Without the charge, Motorola would have posted a $6 million
profit, or 1 cent per share. Stock analysts had expected the
company to post an operating loss of 4 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's shares rose in trading Tuesday, $1.43 3/4 to $55 a
share. Earnings were released after the market closed.
</P>
<P>
   AMD Inc., another chip maker with Austin operations, is to
announce its results today after the market closes. Motorola's
stock has hovered near its 52-week low for several weeks, and
analysts have cited everything from bad leadership to a slow
introduction of digital communication products for the company's
woes.
</P>
<P>
   In the announcement Tuesday, Galvin confirmed that Motorola
would soon announce a restructuring that is expected to divide its
communications business into two segments _ one catering to
consumers, and the other focusing on corporate, internal and
network clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next few days we will announce a more collaborative and
market-focused Communications Enterprise that links together all of
Motorola's communications businesses so they can easily share
resources and cooperate on key business and technology issues,''
Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, analysts have not been impressed with Motorola's
restructuring efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors want to see concrete evidence'' of a turnaround,
said Rick Berry, an analyst at JP Turner. ``The investor community
is getting a little anxious with Motorola's performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's semiconductor business posted an operating loss in
the quarter, compared with a profit a year ago. Sales dropped 11
percent in the quarter to $1.81 billion _ from $2.03 billion for
the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Hurst, a Motorola spokesman in Austin, said the company
would continue to offer its severance package through July, then
continue looking at cuts and consolidation as it has for the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to determine the operations we're going to phase
out. We're going to take a look at every operation and every piece
of every operation. We're not just looking at this as 'let's get
rid of bodies.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Motorola was once Austin's largest private employer with about
11,000 employees here. Currently, the company has between 9,000 and
10,000 workers in the area, Hurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies that have announced layoffs in Texas attributed
to the Asian economic crisis include Compaq, Intel and Applied
Materials, which said it would cut about 1,000 jobs in Austin and
in California over the next year.

MAYOR PLACES AN ALLY'S SON IN BUDGET POST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani appointed Robert Harding as
his budget director Tuesday, choosing to fill a critical position
with a lawyer who has strong political skills but little experience
in fiscal matters, and who is the son of one of Giuliani's closest
political allies.
</P>
<P>
   Harding, who has served the last four years as the
administration's chief lobbyist in Albany, succeeds Joseph Lhota,
who was promoted last week to deputy mayor for operations. Harding
will direct a staff of about 350 and oversee the city's $34 billion
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Harding, 40, has little experience with municipal budgets
compared with his predecessors, and his selection surprised many
fiscal experts, government officials and government watchdog
groups. Several critics dismissed the appointment as a payoff to
Harding's father, Liberal Party leader Raymond Harding, who has
supported and advised Giuliani since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor defended his decision as being based on pure merit,
arguing that Harding possessed other strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a mayor and a deputy mayor for operations who have
great detailed knowledge of the budget after five years in
government,'' Giuliani said. ``And frankly, we needed to add to the
team someone who has a really sophisticated knowledge of
government. I think it's the best balanced team you can put
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani made the announcement at a news conference in City
Hall, sharing the lectern with Harding. The room was filled with
many of the mayor's top aides and commissioners. Harding's wife and
their two daughters sat near the stage, but his parents _ Raymond
and Elizabeth Harding _ chose to sit in the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of you know my mother, Liz, and next to her is her
husband, Ray,'' the new budget director said as he pointed them
out, clearly anticipating the inevitable questions about his
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared remarks, Harding talked little about the
direction of the city's budget. But two props given to him made
clear that he was expected to pursue the Republican mayor's fiscal
policies: a black binder with a single sheet of paper that read
``Just say no,'' and an oversized pair of scissors that the mayor
handed him.
</P>
<P>
   Harding takes over the city's budget in a period of
unprecedented plenty _ fueled by Wall Street's boom, the city ended
the fiscal year in June with a record surplus of at least $2
billion _ as well as unusual political hostility inside City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations over the city's budget for the new fiscal year
collapsed this spring after City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, a
candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor, proposed a
referendum that would ask city voters whether public funds should
be used to help pay for a new Yankee Stadium on Manhattan's West
Side. The move enraged the mayor, who accused Vallone of raising
the issue only to further his gubernatorial ambitions. Amid
recriminations, the council adopted its own budget over the mayor's
veto for the first time, and the battle is expected to go on over
the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani praised Harding's knowledge of government and called
him ``one of the most talented people'' he had worked with. But
critics said that whatever Harding's skills, the overriding reason
for his appointment was his father.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest
Research Group, a good-government organization, said Giuliani, who
has often accused former mayors of cronyism, was being
hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a mayor who excoriated his predecessors for political
patronage,'' Russianoff said, ``and now he behaves the same way by
putting his allies in top posts.''
</P>
<P>
   Harding had been director of New York City's Office of State
Legislative Affairs since 1994. After getting his law degree from
Brooklyn Law School in 1982, he worked as counsel to Assemblyman
William Passannante from 1983 to 1990. From 1991 to 1993, he was
general counsel to the New York State Science and Technology
Foundation, and in 1993, he was counsel to the New York State
Facilities Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's appointment came a few weeks after Giuliani promoted
Russell Harding, 34, another son of the Liberal Party leader, to
run the city's Housing Development Corp., a public authority that
issues bonds for housing projects. That selection also raised
eyebrows because Russell Harding, a college dropout, had no
experience in housing finance.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Giuliani has faced criticism because Raymond
Harding built a prosperous business lobbying city agencies
controlled by the mayor, though he held back from the practice last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Harding said his relationship with the mayor was not a
factor in his son's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody thinks Rudy Giuliani would turn over the management
of a $34 billion budget for political considerations, they don't
know Rudy Giuliani,'' he said.

RIVALS IN HOME DESIGN CLASH OVER STREET SIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just before an annual design and furnishings trade
show in Manhattan last fall, a block of East 58th Street sprouted a
new, chintz-draped street sign proclaiming it ``Designers Way,''
and East 59th Street was transformed into ``Decorators Way.''
</P>
<P>
   The new look was temporary, but now the managers of the
Decoration and Design Building at 979 Third Ave., home to 130
showrooms serving the high-end interior-design business, have asked
the city to make the designation permanent. They say signs flanking
the building would be a fitting recognition of a swatch of the East
Side that is the heart of their industry _ really the only place to
turn if you need $4,000 worth of suede to cover a client's sofa,
say, or some very nice hand-embroidered silk for $2,000 a yard.
</P>
<P>
   And who could object to such a harmless bit of industry
boosterism? Well, the management of a competing design building,
for starters. The owners of the New York Design Center, located at
200 Lexington Ave. at 32nd Street, say the designation would give
an unfair advantage to the Upper East Side building, and have
enlisted the aid of a city councilman who vows to block the new
names.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the rival buildings, known in the industry
as the D and D Building and 200 Lex, has led to some nasty
exchanges, with designers and wholesalers taking sides and
questioning the motives _ or worse, the taste _ of their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm looking for things, it would never enter my mind to
go to 200 Lex,'' said Robert Bray, a Manhattan interior designer.
``It's so middle-class to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed, retorted another Manhattan designer, Adam
Dolle. ``Decorating was an Upper East Side kind of phenomenon,'' he
said. ``But that's not true anymore. Everyone goes everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The street-sign debate is one small indication of broader
changes roiling the world of interior design. Once almost entirely
concentrated on the Upper East Side, showrooms sporting a ``to the
trade'' sign _ the signal that, in theory at least, a customer must
be accompanied by a decorator _ have migrated to neighborhoods like
Chelsea, SoHo and the Flatiron District.
</P>
<P>
   And the D and D Building's effort to market itself and other
nearby establishments as the center of the design universe comes as
the industry is trying to broaden its reach. The showrooms are
seeking to draw a new class of customers who can afford fine
furnishings but may have found the idea of hiring a decorator
intimidating or simply unnecessary, given the growing number of
high-end furniture stores that sell directly to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The D and D Building and 200 Lex, for example, both offer
referral services for customers without a decorator in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that a lot of people have good taste, but they
don't know how to put it all together,'' said Michael Love,
president of Interior Options, the referral service at 200 Lex.
``We want to make them feel comfortable about using professional
help.''
</P>
<P>
   In another break with the industry's fustier traditions, a major
fabric house with a showroom at the D and D Building, Brunschwig &AMP;
Fils, began accepting credit cards, mainly from decorators who in
turn bill their clients, a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Paying with plastic is still unheard of at most showrooms, which
have traditionally demanded payment in advance by check, an
arrangement that offers less protection for dissatisfied customers.
``We decided to do it because more and more clients of ours were
asking for it,'' said Hans Denbroeder, showroom manager at
Brunschwig.
</P>
<P>
   James Druckman, president of the New York Design Center,
contended that the changes in the industry rendered the notion of a
designated design corridor obsolete. ``I think the story is that
New York itself is a design center,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Steven Cohen, president of Cohen Brothers Realty
Corp., which owns the D and D Building, professed astonishment at
the reception his proposal had received. ``I never in a million
years suspected that 200 Lex would take umbrage,'' he said. ``We
are the center of the design industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Buatta, a New York decorator whose clients have included
Barbara Walters and Malcolm Forbes, agreed with Cohen that there
really was no room for debate. ``The D and D Building is
perfection,'' he declared. ``I'm not going to mention names, but if
it's not in the D and D Building, you never remember to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Druckman has found an unlikely ally in Councilman Andrew
Eristoff, a Republican whose district includes the D and D Building
but not 200 Lex. Eristoff said he moved to block the name change _
which requires council approval _ when he concluded that the D and
D Building was trying to gain an unfair advantage over its
long-standing competitor. ``This is an attempt to trump a rival in
a highly commercial dispute,'' said Eristoff, who added that he had
received complaints about the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The more D and D officials have pressed for the signs, the more
they have antagonized Eristoff. He said he was outraged when Cohen
asked state Sen. Roy Goodman, another East Side Republican, to
intervene. Now Eristoff said he would oppose even another temporary
renaming for this fall's design show, which D and D has sought from
the city Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a number of prominent designers agree with Cohen that the
neighborhood surrounding the D and D Building is the focal point of
their industry, and they credit the booming economy and the current
management for the building's success after several lean years.

</P>
<P>
   In the two years since Cohen Bros. Realty bought 979 Third for
$67 million from Travelers Group, which had acquired it in a
foreclosure, occupancy has risen from 70 percent to 100 percent,
with a waiting list of about 50 companies, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, many designers looked down on 200 Lex, saying it
catered mainly to the lower end of the market. Built in 1926 as the
New York Furniture Exchange, the building was converted in 1981
from a marketplace for retail stores into showrooms for decorators
and designers. It includes a number of office furniture showrooms,
some of them refugees from the ill-fated International Design
Center in Long Island City, Queens, which emptied out after the
stock-market crash of 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But 200 Lex, which has 87 showrooms, is taking steps to burnish
its image. Druckman, whose family has been involved with the
building since it opened, has attracted new, prestigious tenants
like Wood &AMP; Hogan, which sells English period furniture and
reproductions. Other longtime high-end tenants include Odegard,
which carries hand-woven Tibetan rugs and Venetian lamps with
hand-painted silk shades inspired by turbans, shields and pagodas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more user-friendly than any other design building in
town, because we were built just to display furniture,'' Druckman
said _ a pointed reminder that the D and D Building was built in
1964 as an apartment house, although it was never inhabited. From
the outset, it has been used as a design house, and tenants and
decorators constantly complain that the elevators are inadequate
for heavy traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Since plans for redoing the living room are often the first
thing to be jettisoned when the economy sours, the D and D's
fortunes have usually depended on the stock market. Robert Lee
Tinker, a former leasing director at 979 Third who now holds the
same position at 200 Lexington, said about a dozen companies were
behind in their rent when Cohen Bros. bought the building and took
over its management from the Merchandise Mart of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those tenants are gone now, and a number of
well-established companies, like Stark, Donghia and Brunschwig &AMP;
Fils, have enlarged their showrooms. Although they also carry
furniture, they specialize in products like carpets and fabrics
that are less vulnerable to swings in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be able to accommodate the expansion of the brand
names and improve the credit-worthiness of the tenants,'' Cohen
said. ``The mom-and-pop showrooms gave way to larger vendors.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has added Astra Cafe, an upscale restaurant managed by
Charlie Palmer, the owner of Aureole, and begun sprucing up the
corridors and the lobby (a perilous undertaking, given that his
tenants tend to have very definite ideas when it comes to
interiors). Not to be outdone, Druckman plans to convert the cafe
in his building into a more elegant restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Druckman, who provides bus service between 200 Lex and the D and
D Building to make it easier for decorators to get to his
showrooms, said he had tried in vain to get Cohen to cooperate with
him by, for example, holding a joint trade fair. ``It would create
a broader market week for the city,'' he said, ``but they want to
do their own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he did not see the value of joining forces on a trade
fair, but he did not rule out other ventures with Druckman. &UR;  &LR; ``I've
tried to work with him,'' he said, ``but he's very interested in
his own personal ends.''

28 ACCUSED OF RACKETEERING AS MEMBERS OF ASIAN GANG 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a case that shows how organized crime continues to
prey on Chinatown, 28 people were accused Tuesday of being members
of a violent Asian gang called Tung On, which federal prosecutors
said had carried out kidnappings, robbery, extortion and other
crimes since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the government charged, the defendants kidnapped
illegal immigrants from China shortly after their arrival in the
United States, and held them for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants described as members and associates of a faction
of the Tung On led by Chen Kevin, 31, who was one of those charged
in the 51-page racketeering indictment unsealed in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Chen and 12 of the defendants remained at large Tuesday,
according to a statement issued by the office of Mary Jo White, the
U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Fifteen other
defendants are already in custody, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges are the latest in a two-year investigation of the
gang in which other accused members have been charged with
kidnapping a 12-year-old boy from his home in Meriden, Conn., on
Nov. 27, 1996, and the murder of a rival gang member at the Hong
Kong Supermarket on East Broadway in Chinatown that same month.
</P>
<P>
   In the kidnapping, the boy was held for six days and was
released unharmed in Queens after his father paid his abductors
$88,000.
</P>
<P>
   The charges announced Tuesday are the broadest filed by federal
prosecutors in Manhattan against a Chinatown gang since 1996, when
Ms. White's office charged 64 people of being members of a gang
called the Fukienese Flying Dragons.
</P>
<P>
   Those defendants were accused of robbery and other violent
crimes, including smuggling illegal Chinese immigrants into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The charges announced Tuesday do not include smuggling
immigrants, but in some cases, the defendants were accused of
carrying out kidnappings of immigrants shortly after they were
smuggled in to the United States by others.
</P>
<P>
   Some abductions took place at Kennedy International Airport,
court documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Ko-lin Chin, a professor at Rutgers University in Newark, N.J.,
who has written two books on Chinese gangs, said Tuesday that the
Tung On is one of four well-established gangs in Chinatown.
Although the new charges may briefly slow the pace of organized
criminal activity, he said, they are unlikely to eradicate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later new members will be recruited,'' Chin said,
``and the younger members will be promoted, simply because the
political economy of Chinatown remains the same.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There are still a lot of businesses to be extorted.
There are still a lot of people being smuggled into the United
States. And when you have a lot of illegal immigrants living in a
community that's small, congested, isolated, it gives the gangs
additional opportunities to victimize the illegal immigrants. They
are more vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges were the result of a joint investigation by the FBI,
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and the New York
City Police Department, Ms. White's office said.

AT TRIAL IN BOMB PLOT, OFFICER RECOUNTS RAID 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Testifying Tuesday in the trial of two men accused of
plotting to bomb a subway station last year, a police officer who
took part in the violent predawn raid that led to their arrests
said he fired at the two defendants after one of them tried to take
his gun and the other lunged toward a bag he believed contained a
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the stand on the trial's second day in U.S. District
Court in Brooklyn, Officer David Martinez, a member of the New York
Police Department's Emergency Services Unit, described to rapt
jurors how he stormed into a bedroom in a apartment in Park Slope,
Brooklyn, just after 4:30 a.m. last July 31 after the police
received a tip of a bomb plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I entered the room and the individual to the right lunged at
me to the right, which is where I hold my gun,'' Martinez said. ``A
struggle ensued, and I fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he fired a total of six shots at the two
defendants, Ghazi Ibrahim Abu Maizar, who is now 24, and Lafi
Khalil, now 23, both of whom face up to life in prison if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers have contended that neither defendant moved when
the police rushed into the bedroom. Instead, they say the officers,
nervous after being told that two Arab men were in the bedroom with
a bomb, entered the room firing.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by one of the defense lawyers, Michael
Padden, Martinez said he fired only after one of the defendants
tried to grab his weapon and that he felt no unusual amount of fear
before the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said that just as the raid began, his partner
accidentally locked the apartment's front door instead of opening
it with a key given to them by Abdel Rahman Mosabbah, the roommate
who flagged down police officers in the street and reported the
bomb plot.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he did not fear that the brief conversation after
the gaffe alerted the men inside. ``I actually thought it relieved
some of the tension,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Martinez's testimony, prosecutors told the judge that
Mosabbah complained that Abu Maizar made a threatening gesture
toward him. Throughout the court proceedings, Abu Maizar has
grinned during hearings. He also made two crude escape attempts
that have drawn angry criticism from Judge Reena Raggi.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, during a conference between lawyers and
Judge Raggi, the judge told defense lawyers that several court
staffers had told her that Abu Maizar tried to make faces in court
Tuesday at Mosabbah. And an assistant U.S. attorney, Bernadette
Miragliotta, said that Mosabbah complained to prosecutors that Abu
Maizar raised his finger at him. ``In the Middle East, raising your
finger is viewed as a threat.'' Ms. Miragliotta said.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Maizar's lawyer, Jan Rostal, said her client has been
animated while in court, but she did not see him make faces or
raise his finger at Mosabbah.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Maizar's behavior inside and outside the courtroom was also
an issue during pretrial hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials confirmed that Abu Maizar has made two crude
escape attempts within the last month. In one, first reported in
Newsday, he jumped onto a courtroom table in the midst of a
pretrial hearing in an apparent attempt to make a run for the
courtroom door.
</P>
<P>
   In the other attempted escape, reported in The New York Post on
Tuesday, Abu Maizar tore a section of ceiling down in a court
building holding cell in an apparent effort to find a crawl space
or air duct. He found no escape route and stopped when a court
officer confronted him.
</P>
<P>
   While Abu Maizar, who refuses to stand when the jury enters the
courtroom, appears to mock the court at times, his co-defendant
seems dejected. Khalil has appeared morose during court
proceedings. He rarely speaks to his lawyer and frequently stares
at the floor.

5 INDICTED IN SEX ABUSE OF 3 CHILDREN IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a case that has raised questions about the city's
monitoring of abused and neglected children under its watch,
prosecutors in Brooklyn handed down a multiple-count indictment
Tuesday charging five adults with a variety of sex offenses
involving three minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victims in this case are children who were violated
sexually in a reign of terror,'' Brooklyn District Attorney Charles
Hynes said in announcing the indictments. ``These charges are
deeply disturbing, because the innocence of children is precious.
These defendants are accused of attacking children who had a right
to be loved and cherished.''
</P>
<P>
   The children _ an 8-year-old boy and two girls, sisters ages 13
and 14 _ were raped and sodomized during a five-year span between
1993 and last month, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Those named in the indictment were Ezra Fremgen, 25, Vincent
Fremgen, 28, both of 149 Starr St., Brooklyn, and Daniel Robacker,
40, Theresa Fremgen, 35, and Curtis James, 35, all of 232 Linden
St., Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Robacker and Ms. Fremgen are the parents of the girls. James is
the father of the boy. And Ezra and Vincent Fremgen are Ms.
Fremgen's brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Among other charges, Ezra Fremgen is accused of forcing his
nieces to engage in oral sex with each other and forcing them to
have oral sex with a dog. Ezra Fremgen is also accused of
videotaping James engaging in sodomy with his son.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Fremgen is charged with incest in the rape, sodomy and
sexual abuse of his nieces, and Robacker is charged with incest in
the rape, sodomy and sexual abuse of his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fremgen is accused of videotaping her brother, Ezra,
sexually abusing James' 8-year-old son, and James is accused of
raping and sodomizing both girls, sexually abusing his son and
directing him to have sex with a dog while being videotaped.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious charges, rape and sodomy in the first degree,
carry a maximum prison term of 12{ years to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these defendants are convicted,'' Hynes said, ``I will ask
for maximum consecutive sentences so that they will never again be
free to threaten or harm another child.''

YEAR AFTER VANDALISM, REPAIRS BEGIN IN HISTORIC BLACK CEMETERY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A year after vandals destroyed a historic black
graveyard on Staten Island, church members Tuesday began restoring
26 marble and granite stones that were toppled like dominoes and
smashed to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The workers were from the Rossville AME Zion Church, whose
cemetery was established in the early 1800s by free black oystermen
who moved to Staten Island from the Eastern Shore of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The community, known as Sandy Ground, and the cemetery, which
has long been renowned as the United States' most significant black
burial ground, were both Underground Railroad stops in the 1800s
and have since been symbols of strength for many blacks. Among
those who have made pilgrimages there are poet Maya Angelou, writer
Alex Haley and civil rights activist Julian Bond, now chairman of
the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   The vandalism was discovered Aug. 23, 1997, after what the
police said was a night of drinking by local youths, who
neighborhood residents have said often take over the cemetery on
summer nights. Two teen-age boys were charged with criminal
mischief, trespassing and aggravated harassment. While a judge
instructed one of the boys to research the history of Sandy Ground,
the boys' cases are pending in juvenile court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very, very upset when this happened, both as the
congregation and those who had loved ones there,'' said Yvonne
Taylor, the chairwoman of the church's board of trustees. ``And we
are certainly glad that these repairs are happening. It has made us
content.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining descendants still living in Sandy Ground expressed
grief about the vandalism. ``Wouldn't you be upset if you spent
$2,000 on a headstone, only to see in toppled over?'' said
Christopher A. Moody, who is a descendant of the Dutch, Indians and
free blacks from New Jersey, New York and Maryland who lived on
Staten Island. ``The kids go up there on weekends and are drinking
and fill up on dope, and they cause senseless damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody, 83, said his grandparents, parents, sister and brother
are all buried in the cemetery. ``Why can't they just let them rest
in peace?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration was made possible by a $4,000 grant from the
Sacred Sites fund of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, a group
dedicated to the preservation of historic landmarks throughout the
state. The grant pays for all but $1,200 of the repairs to the
stones, which have to be cleaned, pieced back together with steel
rods and, in some cases, planted back into the ground. The church
is raising the $1,200 on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a critical part of Staten Island's history,'' said Peg
Breen, the president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy. ``And
from the preservationist point of view, cemeteries are very
important and are often overlooked in the scheme of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Ground was founded in the 1830s by oystermen from Maryland
fleeing laws that forbade freed slaves from congregating and
required all oyster boats to have a white navigator. At its peak in
the mid-1880s, the settlement had about 150 families. The community
had been slowly shrinking for many decades, but developers began
buying the available land and houses in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Now fewer than 10 original Sandy Grove families remain, their
wooden homes like driftwood in a sea of recently built town houses.
Older residents say newcomers have shown little respect for
history.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Moody Lewis, the president of the Sandy Ground Historical
Society, said that some good had come out of the vandalism. She
noted that the cemetery had been long overdue for a cleaning and
that one of young men accused of the destruction had stopped by _
on a court order _ to learn more about the neighborhood's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes negatives can become positives,'' Ms. Lewis said.

DOCTORS BATTLE TO SAVE TINY VICTIM OF FLESH-KILLING BACTERIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- An 11-month-old girl underwent surgery as she
struggled against an infection from flesh-killing bacteria, which
already has taken one-fifth of her skin.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl, identified only as Baby Rosa, was listed in
critical but stable condition Tuesday after an operation during
which surgeons covered her wounds with cadaver skin to guard
against further infection.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said they believe they have stopped the rampaging
bacteria that has destroyed so much of her small body.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the signs are that this child's ability to fight this
infection is getting better, so I would think her prognosis is
good,'' said Dr. John Alexander, head of the hyperbaric treatment
unit at Northridge Hospital Medical Center in suburban Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors aren't sure how Rosa caught the illness. Her parents,
who requested anonymity, rushed her to a hospital in Ventura, in
neighboring Ventura County, last week after watching the skin on
the left side of her chest and back turn burgundy red, doctors
said.
</P>
<P>
   When she was admitted to Ventura County Medical Center with a
fever of 104 degrees, the child was in shock, her body overwhelmed
by a virulent strain of a normally harmless bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Several kinds of germs can cause this condition, commonly
referred to as ``flesh-eating bacteria'' even though tissue is
killed rather than consumed. The germs often are found on healthy
people who show no sign of infection, but they can wreak havoc if
they get under the skin through a cut or sore.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are standard organisms,'' Alexander said. ``It is really
the host, in this case a baby, not handling what should be an
easily handled infection.''
</P>
<P>
   On Rosa, doctors found no obvious breaks in the skin that could
have ushered in the infection.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of trouble came when Rosa's parents noticed that
their only child had a sore throat. Then came the discoloration,
spreading from her chest to midway across her back.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had to cut away one of her back muscles, about 20
percent of her skin and the fatty tissue beneath to stop the
infection. In another two weeks, they hope to begin transplanting
some of her own skin, perhaps from her scalp, to replace the
cadaver skin applied Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, they noted that Rosa probably faces years of
reconstructive and cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa's infection is rare in many ways. The disease strikes few
people -- about 500 to 1,500 nationwide each year -- according to
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Few of its
victims are children, although some as young as 6 months old have
been known to catch the disease through sores caused by chickenpox.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa's illness also appears to have been caused by a strain of
the staphylococcus bacterium, not the streptococcus behind most
cases. Duc Vugia, medical epidemiologist with the state Department
of Health Services, said the bacteria may be working in concert
with others in Rosa's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of staph causing this by itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of young children should watch for several of the
disease's warning signs: red and swollen skin around a cut,
vomiting, a lack of appetite and a sore throat accompanied by high
fever, Vugia said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Northridge Hospital Medical Center said Rosa's
parents were stunned by her illness. Because they have no medical
insurance, the hospital has paid for her treatment -- more than
$100,000 so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't turn your back on a child,'' said Dr. Stephen
Bresnick.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, however, might be eligible for emergency Medi-Cal
funds, doctors said.

2 IN L.A. TENTATIVELY LINKED TO N.Y. WOMAN'S DISAPPEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (expands 18th graf to refer to fugitive warrant; changes Ms.
Silverman to Mrs. throughout)  (also see sidebar, ny-missing-woman) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Officially, the disappearance of Irene Silverman, an
82-year-old Upper East Side socialite, was still listed on Tuesday
as a missing-persons case, an incident without motive, witness, or
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an elderly female who has disappeared very
mysteriously,'' said Police Inspector Joseph Reznick.
</P>
<P>
   But as a team of detectives fanned out across the city, seeking
traces of Mrs. Silverman, they also sought clues about two people
already in custody _ an unlikely mother-son team of con artists who
have been convicted of crimes as varied as stealing fur coats and
enslaving Mexican immigrants and who are wanted for questioning in
a Los Angeles murder.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Silverman, whose home decor was inspired in part by the
palace of Versailles, was last seen walking through her town house
in a nightgown on Sunday morning and was reported missing by her
housekeeping staff on Sunday night. On Monday evening, after
finding blood outside Mrs. Silverman's apartment, police released a
sketch of a tenant who was wanted for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   A New York City detective who happened to see the sketch on
television immediately alerted Manhattan investigators to a
fortunate coincidence: the man, known to Mrs. Silverman as Manny
Guerin and to investigators as Kenneth Kimes, was already behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes, 23, had been arrested along with his 63-year-old mother,
Sante Kimes, on an unrelated federal warrant on Sunday evening that
accused him of passing a bad $14,000 check in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   That discovery led to more intriguing clues. The Kimeses were
carrying Mrs. Silverman's identification at the time of their
arrest, said an investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity,
and detectives said that their curiosity was further piqued by a
call from Los Angeles police, who want to question the Kimeses in
connection with the murder of a man whose body was found in a
garbage bin in Venice on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Los Angeles Police Department declined to
identify the victim or discuss the case. But another law
enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that the victim was a Granada Hills, Calif., man whose home was
sold after his death and the proceeds apparently stolen.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department, Officer
Eduardo Funes, said that police were investigating the death of the
man, David Kazdin, 63, but said that there were no suspects and
declined to discuss details of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Another law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that Kazdin's home was sold after his death and the
proceeds were apparently stolen; detectives want to question the
Kimeses to determine whether they have information about the case.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan on East 65th Street on Tuesday, neighbors,
employees, and acquaintances said that they were worried for Mrs.
Silverman's safety, and they related incidents and anecdotes from a
unique and intriguing life.
</P>
<P>
   Professor James Schenton, who befriended Mrs. Silverman 20 years
ago when she took his history course at Columbia University,
described her as a sprightly octogenarian with a storied past and
passionate interest in the arts and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   She was a former dancer with the corps de ballet at Radio City
Music Hall in the early 1930s, who gave up the stage for society
and later married. Her husband Samuel died in 1973, and friends
said that in her later years, Mrs. Silverman had channeled her
enthusiasm toward her multimillion-dollar limestone home, half a
block from Central Park, which she had divided into lavish
apartments and operated as a sort of boarding house for the
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a woman who has a fascinating propensity to become
involved in all kinds of things,'' Schenton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after Mrs. Silverman's disappearance, police
immediately grew concerned, because it was unheard of for her to
leave the home unaccompanied by a member of her domestic staff,
Reznick said. A search of the property brought another chilling
discovery, an investigator said _ a trail of blood on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator said that one servant had told detectives that
Mrs. Silverman recently argued with Kimes and had threatened to
evict him from his $6,000-a-month apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He apparently kept watching her, and that rubbed her the wrong
way,'' said an investigator. ``She had very high standards and
occasionally threw people out if they weren't up to snuff. And the
thought of a guest keeping her under surveillance, that was just
too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kimes, an Oklahoma native who has used eight aliases, has a
handful of arrests for theft, using forged credentials and fraud,
according to police records. She once sued a San Diego doctor for
malpractice, but according to court documents, she herself was
forced to pay damages because the charges were untrue.
</P>
<P>
   She was found guilty of stealing a $6,500 mink coat from the
Mayflower Hotel in Washington in 1985, court records show. In 1986,
Ms. Kimes was convicted of enticing young women from Mexico across
the border to her home in La Jolla, California, then preventing
them from leaving and forcing them to work in virtual slavery. Ms.
Kimes served a five-year sentence in federal prison, according to
law enforcement records.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two years, Ms. Kimes had apparently begun
operating with her son Kenneth, who had robbery and assault
convictions in Florida, police said. The pair had lived together
briefly in California and have been sought by federal officials
since April, when they allegedly used a bad check to purchase a
Lincoln Town car.
</P>
<P>
   Although some investigators held out hope that Mrs. Silverman
would be found alive, the grim reality of police work forced them
to explore the worst possibilities. Officers searched Central Park
early on Tuesday but found no signs of Mrs. Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   On two separate occasions they were also called to a recycling
center in the Hunt's Point section of the Bronx, where human body
parts were discovered. After conferring with the city medical
examiner, detectives determined that neither the human arm nor the
human leg discovered there could have belonged to Mrs. Silverman,
though it was not clear whose they were.

MALNOURISHED BOY ALSO HAD BROKEN RIBS, DOCTORS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 2-year-old malnourished boy who was taken from a
Staten Island foster home over the weekend also had seven fractured
ribs, a hospital doctor who examined him said Tuesday. And
officials familiar with the investigation say doctors have also
found scars and scabs all over his body.
</P>
<P>
   Leonora Wiener, a spokeswoman for the Administration for
Children's Services, declined to comment on the injuries, but said
the agency was investigating whether the boy had been physically
abused by his foster mother or someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we're gathering all the medical evidence,'' Ms.
Wiener said.
</P>
<P>
   His foster mother, Deanna Allston, was arrested on Sunday and
charged with neglecting the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Teresa Lemma, a pediatrician at St. Vincent's Medical Center
in Staten Island, said doctors were trying to determine when the
boy broke his ribs.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was taken from his biological mother and placed in Ms.
Allston's home when he was 4 months old, in January 1996, officials
say. His mother, who was accused of abusing drugs, lost her rights
to the boy in May. Ms. Allston agreed to adopt the child, a
decision approved by lawyers for the child, city officials and the
foster care agency, Catholic Home Bureau. Ms. Allston had no record
of abusing or neglecting children in her care, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But in May and June, prosecutors say, Ms. Allston failed to seek
medical attention for the boy, who suffered from severe diarrhea
and weight loss. The boy's caseworker, who said the child seemed
healthy in May, failed to visit the child in June, as required by
state law. Another caseworker, who was visiting other children
living in the home on June 15, noticed that the boy was thin, but
did not think anything was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the boy was rushed to the hospital on Saturday, he
was dehydrated, ``bony, and his skin was sagging,'' Dr. Lemma said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Licitra, Ms. Allston's lawyer, declined to comment
Tuesday. A law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said Ms. Allston has said that the boy was lactose
intolerant and suffered from stomach problems. Dr. Lemma said the
hospital had yet to determine whether that was true.
</P>
<P>
   She said lab tests showed that the boy's protein levels were
satisfactory, but he is seriously underweight. He weighed 18 pounds
when he was brought to the hospital, less than 97 percent of
children at his age, Dr. Lemma said. He also exhibits many classic
symptoms of victims of abuse and neglect, said Dr. Lemma, who heads
St. Vincent's Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect.
</P>
<P>
   When the boy arrived at the hospital, he refused to walk or
speak and avoided eye contact. He started walking on his own on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's clearly been neglected,'' Dr. Lemma said.

A LIFE OF GRAND ADVENTURE IN A BELOVED TOWN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (sidebar with NY-MISSING)  
 (bl)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Irene Zambelli Silverman once airily described the
unconventional setup at her Upper East Side town house, where she
rented luxuriously decorated apartments to wealthy strangers, as
``something between posh hotel and grand boardinghouse.''
</P>
<P>
   To the elderly widow, it was a grand adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interesting tenants _ short term,'' she explained in a 1990
letter to Christopher Gray, a New York architectural historian and
contributor to The New York Times, who wrote about Mrs. Silverman's
home.
</P>
<P>
   When she disappeared from her home at 20 E. 65th St. last
Sunday, Mrs. Silverman was 82 years old and still the energetic
landlady to an ever-changing galaxy of tenants who rented her
furnished suites and office space _ maid service included _ for
thousands of dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a funny environment, kind of catch as catch can,'' said
Alan Alpern, an entrepreneur who rented part of the ground floor
about 12 years ago as an office for himself and for the consulting
business of his then-wife, Marife Hernandez. ``There were always
strange people going and coming and staying over.''
</P>
<P>
   During his three or four years as a tenant, Alpern said, he
twice visited Mrs. Silverman for tea in her duplex apartment in the
building. ``She was a very nice lady,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Silverman had divided the stately mansion into
self-contained apartments, some with kitchens, about 15 years ago.
Once she set it up, friends said, she ran the rental business with
the same meticulous attention to detail that she devoted to the
upkeep of her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always did credit references and would check people up and
down,'' said Harry Papaioannou, 39, a carpenter who said he has
known Mrs. Silverman for more than 10 years. ``She helped
everybody. She was a very nice lady _ maybe too nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they were tenants, Mrs. Silverman's renters also
thought of her as a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Sinkel, who rented an apartment with a marble fireplace and
large armoires for 18 months, described the atmosphere as somewhere
between that of a friendly Parisian hotel and a salon, with Mrs.
Silverman sometimes lending her antique silver for a dinner party
and slipping a bottle of champagne into his dining room before an
important date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irene had interesting people _ business people, people in the
arts,'' said Sinkel, who stayed in touch after moving out six years
ago. ``I think she just liked having people she liked around.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Silverman also was a font of amusing stories about her
years in New York City, regaling acquaintances about her
experiences living in a walkup apartment with an active brothel on
the floor above.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, she and her husband, who was active in the real estate
business, purchased the East 65th Street house. Years later, she
once said, she became fascinated by its history and found it had
once been the home of the Sherrill family, socially prominent in
the golden age of the East Side, at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   An avid gardener who kept the roof terrace of her limestone
mansion planted with lush foliage and lighted up at night, Mrs.
Silverman spoke with passion about her home, with its garden and
its memories and its first-class address. She once said she knew
its ``every screw and nail'' and kept the interior of the
four-story building buffed and polished.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband hated the idea of this house. He said it's a big
white elephant _ it will just weigh us down,'' she recalled in a
letter to Gray a few years ago. She said she even briefly
considered selling it in 1968 but found she couldn't do it.
``Fortunately,'' Mrs. Silverman wrote, ``I chickened out!''

<P>
   Will it be different this year? Will both the market and the
Wall Street strategists who backed it last year run out of gas in
the second half of 1998? Don't count on that yet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the market was scaling then unprecedented
heights, the optimistic voices on Wall Street loudly proclaimed,
``This time it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical comparisons that showed the market to be way
overvalued were irrelevant, announced the group, led by Abby Joseph
Cohen of Goldman Sachs. American corporations had become the most
efficient in the world, inflation was vanquished, and interest
rates were on their way down, Cohen and the others pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disturbingly low dividend yields and disturbingly high
price-to-earnings rations, the stock market is cheap, they
preached.
</P>
<P>
   And they were right. For the 12 months ended April 24, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index had appreciated a stunning 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But now, by all historical measures, the stock market is even
more stunningly overvalued. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 trades at
slightly less than 28 times trailing earnings _ a year ago many
experts called the market expensive when the price-to-earnings
ratio ran past 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average trades at 64 times dividends _
the yield on these stocks is a Japan-like 1.55 percent. A year ago
it seemed the height of insanity when the index traded at 55 times
dividends and the yield was 1.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. In late April, with 381 of the 500 companies in
the S&AMP;P 500 having reported their earnings for the first quarter of
1998, the average year-to-year growth rate was a meager 3.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what could possibly be left of the ``This time it's
different'' case? The case now rests almost completely on continued
low inflation and continued declines in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Steve Slifer, chief U.S. economist for Lehman
Brothers, believes that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond will
fall to 5.25 percent in 1998 from about 6 percent now and then dip
even lower, to 5 percent, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation remains under control and bond yields fall, stock
prices will rise. In interest rates fall, the yield on the S&AMP;P 500
won't look quite so piddling.
</P>
<P>
   Slower earnings growth will be less of a problem, too, since
investors will compare any increase with the decline in bond
yields. A lower inflation rate will also make each dollar of
earnings more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, equities will become an even more attractive
alternative to bonds and other types of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Delightful to ponder, but just how likely is that? After all,
interest rates have already dropped awfully low, haven't they?
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury was 7.1 percent in April 1997.
The April 1998 rate of 6 percent represents a 15 percent drop in
one year. Isn't it just wishful thinking to imagine that interest
rates will fall another 17 percent by the end of 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, if you look at real interest rates instead of the
nominal figures that everybody follows. The real interest rate
takes inflation into account _ it's what the interest from a bond
or other interest-paying asset is actually worth after you subtract
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April, for example, the nominal interest rate on a
30-year Treasury bond was 6 percent. The real rate was 6 percent
minus the current inflation rate of 1.4 percent, or 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates have actually climbed during the market's
recent seven-and-a-half-year expansion. In October 1990, the long
bond yielded almost 9 percent. But with inflation for the year at a
little over 6 percent, the real yield was just under 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as the fall in interest rates has been since 1990
(from 9 percent to 6 percent), the decline in inflation has been
even steeper (from 6.1 percent to the current 1.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates, consequently, haven't fallen at all.
They've actually risen, to 4.6 percent from 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of real rates, argues the ``This time it's
different'' crowd, is a result of scars from the horrendous
inflation of the 1970s and 1980s. Prices rose at an annual rate of
6.3 percent from 1971 to the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Once investors finally admit that inflation is under control for
the foreseeable future, real interest rates and thus nominal rates
will fall. Getting to a 5 percent nominal yield on the 30-year bond
is easy if inflation stays at 1.4 percent and the real rate falls
to a still-hefty 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another way to interpret the stubbornly
high real rate of interest. Investors may be justifiably skeptical
about the death of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in 30-year bonds may be demanding a 4.6 percent real
yield because they believe that the Federal Reserve won't hold the
line, that Congress won't be able to resist spending its way back
into deficit, that the current collapse of global inflation is a
temporary respite before Asian consumers renew their demand for
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run investors ignore those arguments at their
peril. But these dangers don't look capable of derailing the ``This
time it's different'' case in the short run _ for the rest of 1998
and into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office is now projecting just an $8
billion surplus for the fiscal year ending in October _ a small
enough margin to discourage Congress from letting loose its most
expansive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is perched on the verge of another and deeper recession.
That will slow Asia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is unlikely to tighten dramatically.
Chairman Alan Greenspan knows that increasing U.S. interest rates
will create bigger problems in Asia, and he vividly remembers the
last time the Federal Reserve set off a financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the ``This time it's different'' crowd still seems
to be betting the winning hand. In that way, at least, this time
it's the same. &QL;

   What a great time to be selling a house. Buyers are manic over
low interest rates. The new tax law lets sellers pocket up to
$500,000 in tax-free gains.
</P>
<P>
   But you're hardly the only seller on the block, so your chalet
could probably use, say, a grand's worth of attention. You'll
recoup the investment many times over when your house sells faster,
at the price it's really worth.
</P>
<P>
   Have a trusted friend walk through the property and point out
everything that's wrong, says Diane Shrewsberry, a real-estate
agent with Coldwell Banker.
</P>
<P>
   It'll hurt, but it's important, because you've stopped noticing
the tear in the screen, the lock that sticks, and the, uh, aroma.
</P>
<P>
   Take a walk yourself through a few builders' models, then steal
ideas, says Michael Holigan, host of the television series ``Your
New House.'' If white interiors are the rage now and you've got
busy wallpaper, start painting.
</P>
<P>
   Many buyers drive up to a house then refuse to go in because
something minor about the exterior turns them off, says
Shrewsberry.
</P>
<P>
   A new mailbox is an inexpensive way to make a good first
impression. So is a new welcome mat or even a new front door (or a
coat of paint on the old one.)
</P>
<P>
   Some more tips:
</P>
<P>
   Unclog the driveway. If your cars don't fit in the garage, park
in the street, says Ralph Roberts of Ralph R. Roberts Real Estate
in Detroit, Mich. Keep the garage door closed and trash cans out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Landscape. Plant whatever should be blossoming that time of
year, says Daryl Jesperson, president of RE/MAX International in
Denver, Colo. De-landscape, too: Overgrown trees make a house look
small; overgrown bushes block light.
</P>
<P>
   For indoor improvements, concentrate on the kitchen and master
bath, ``where people picture they'll spend most of their time,''
says Holigan. Essential: Wallpaper bathrooms. Re-caulk around tubs
(yellow caulk shows sales). Hang new shower-curtain liners.
</P>
<P>
   Think bright. Install higher-watt bulbs in low-light areas, like
closets. Make sure every single bulb in the house works. ``It's
quite a blooper when the lights don't come on,'' says Holigan.
</P>
<P>
   Simplify. Clear kitchen counters. De-junk closets, drawers and
medicine cabinets. If the space doesn't look big enough for your
stuff, it won't look big enough for theirs, says Jesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Don't rely on a realtor to provide info on schools in your area,
says Holigan. Leave information packets from local schools on your
kitchen counter, with your name, address, and phone number on top.
</P>
<P>
   Create a packet about your house, too, says Roberts. Have a
mortgage broker write out the cost of buying your home with various
percentages down. A buyer who might have considered the place too
expensive could realize that it is within range.
</P>
<P>
   By including the amounts of your monthly tax and utility bills,
you'll make buyers suspicious of homeowners who don't.
</P>
<P>
   A final caution: Once you've restored the house to its original
glory, be prepared to start wondering why you're moving out in the
first place. &QL;

   What a great time to be selling a house. Buyers are manic over
low interest rates. The new tax law lets sellers pocket up to
$500,000 in tax-free gains.
</P>
<P>
   But you're hardly the only seller on the block, so your chalet
could probably use, say, a grand's worth of attention. You'll
recoup the investment many times over when your house sells faster,
at the price it's really worth.
</P>
<P>
   Have a trusted friend walk through the property and point out
everything that's wrong, says Diane Shrewsberry, a real-estate
agent with Coldwell Banker.
</P>
<P>
   It'll hurt, but it's important, because you've stopped noticing
the tear in the screen, the lock that sticks, and the, uh, aroma.
</P>
<P>
   Take a walk yourself through a few builders' models, then steal
ideas, says Michael Holigan, host of the television series ``Your
New House.'' If white interiors are the rage now and you've got
busy wallpaper, start painting.
</P>
<P>
   Many buyers drive up to a house then refuse to go in because
something minor about the exterior turns them off, says
Shrewsberry.
</P>
<P>
   A new mailbox is an inexpensive way to make a good first
impression. So is a new welcome mat or even a new front door (or a
coat of paint on the old one.)
</P>
<P>
   Some more tips:
</P>
<P>
   Unclog the driveway. If your cars don't fit in the garage, park
in the street, says Ralph Roberts of Ralph R. Roberts Real Estate
in Detroit, Mich. Keep the garage door closed and trash cans out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Landscape. Plant whatever should be blossoming that time of
year, says Daryl Jesperson, president of RE/MAX International in
Denver, Colo. De-landscape, too: Overgrown trees make a house look
small; overgrown bushes block light.
