<HEADLINE> Indian Foundation To Open Medical University In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- An International Meical
University (IMU), the first private university to be established
in the country, is scheduled to open its doors in July.
</P>
<P>
The university, to be run by an educational foundation based
in India, will start with some 550 students in various medical
disciplines leading to the award of a Bachelor of Medicine and a
Bachelor of Surgery, Xinhua learned today.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding was signed here last December
between the Vighnan Educational Foundation (VEF) of the city of
Bangalore in India, and the ministry of Science, Technology and
Higher Education of Tanzania, an information official in the
Indian High Commission here told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Indian official said the university would follow a
syllabus applicable for universities in India, which he said
contains certain features not available in medical studies in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Some four to five years should be needed for students pursuing
the Bachelor of Medicine, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
According to the memorandum, the university to be wholly owned
by the foundation, will run a medical college taking 250
students, a dental college with 100 students, a pharmacy college
with 100 students and colleges of engineering and business
management with 100 students each.
</P>
<P>
Gender and dental hospitals will also be established to afford
the students access to practical skills as well as rendering
medical services to city residents and others.
</P>
<P>
The Indian official said the initial investment for the
opening of the institution was estimated at over 10 million US
dollars, and would start operating in a hired building in the
city.
</P>
<P>
He further said the idea to start the university had been
readily accepted because of its benefits to the country.
</P>
<P>
"First, it will be run without using government money," he
said, "second, we have been assured that 25 percent of the total
enrolment will be reserved for Tanzanian students who will pay in
local currency."
</P>
<P>
The reserved places for local students should be paid by the
government on a cost-sharing basis, while other local students
whose parents can afford the costs could compete for the rest of
the places available and pay in foreign currency, the official
said.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Watch Export Down First Time in a Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's export of watch
and watch parts saw its first decline in a decade in 1995, which
totalled 7.67 billion Swiss francs (6.39 billion U.S dollars),
down 3.6 percent from 7.96 billion Sfs (6.63 billion dollars) in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The watch-making industry was in last year ranked as the third
largest export industry in Switzerland, accounting for 8 percent
of the total value of the country's industrial exports, said a
bulletin released Wednesday by the Federation of Swiss
Watch-Making Industry.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Swiss watch-makers sold some 35.8 million pieces of
watches and watch parts in the major importing countries and
regions of Asia, the United States, Western Europe and the Middle
East, down 4.4 percent in volume from 1994.
</P>
<P>
Except for a 4.3 percent increase in value on the U.S. market,
declines in value of 5.5 percent, 3.3 percent and 11.15 percent
were respectively recorded in Asia, Western Europe and the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
The watch-making industry federation in the bulletin blamed the
change in consumers' psychology for the less luxury medium-grade
products and the adverse effect of the strong Swiss francs for the
decline in watch export.
</P>
<P>
The federation reported a reduction in market demand of the
Swiss-made luxury watches last year and meanwhile increased demand
of medium- and low-grade mechanical watches.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Swiss watch-makers exported 5.7 million pieces of
medium- and low-grade mechanical watches, up 23.4 percent over
1994, totalling 1.35 billion Sfs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a sharp decline was registered in the export value of
non-metallic low-grade watches including Swatch, following a 22
percent reduction in 1994.

<HEADLINE> UNITA to Continue Quartering Fighters at Assembly Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) pledged today to continue
quartering its fighters at the UN-supervised assembly camps.
</P>
<P>
This was said by UNITA delegate to the joint commission on
Angola's peace process Isaias Samakuva to reporters here after
the 31st regular session of the commission.
</P>
<P>
He promised to continue camping UNITA guerrillas although he
said his organization failed to quarter 16,500 fighters at
assembly camps as scheduled today.
</P>
<P>
Samakuva disclosed that up to February 7 or Wednesday UNITA
had sent more than 8,000 fighters to four camps.
</P>
<P>
The United States Ambassador to Angola, Donald Steimburg, said
here today he was "disappointed" over the slow pace of camping
former UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations peace monitors, only 8,200
UNITA armed soldiers have gathered at the U.N.-supervised
assembly camps.
</P>
<P>
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi earlier pledged to disarm 16,500 of
his estimated 60,000 troops ahead of Thursday's Security Council
decision on a three-month extension of U.N. peacekeeping mandate
in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. envoy said he was "happy" about Savimbi's
commitment to the camping plan.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community ought to bear part of the
responsibilities for the delay of the UNITA assembly in that some
of the assembly camps are short of logistic suppliers and funds.
</P>
<P>
However, Steimburg said the U.N.'s three-month extension of
Observers Mission in Angola is a "right decision."
</P>
<P>
"If the U.N. peacekeeping operation was to be trimmed down,
this country would be back at war within a month," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Samakuva held that the UN decision showed the international
community's concern for Angola and its "belief that the Angolans
will continue to honor the peace accord reached in Lusaka."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. operation costs one million US dollars a day and
hickups in the peace process have frustrated the international
community.
</P>
<P>
More than two million people have been displaced by the
Angolan civil war, which erupted on independence from Portugal in
1975, and aid groups provide food for about 1.1 million displaced
Angolans.
</P>
<P>
The government will incorporate 26,000 former rebels into a
new army, but ways of including UNITA's generals into the single
army are still being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
President Dos Santos has agreed to meet Savimbi outside Angola
for a fourth time to discuss organization of an unity government
and a single army.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Extends Angolan Peacekeeping Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Thursday extended a peace-keeping mission in Angola for
three months until May 8.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Angola Verification, the largest peacekeeping mission
of 6,600 troops, is to verify the disengagement of forces under a
1994 agreement ending the most recent fighting.
</P>
<P>
Buy the extension fell short of six months suggested by U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his recent report to
the council.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Source said that this was intended to the exert pressure
on the Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA the
guerrilla group led by Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi had promised to send 16,500 of his 62,500 troops to
demobilization centers by Thursday. Only a quarter of that number
had been assembled by the beginning of this week.
</P>
<P>
In its unanimously adopted resolution, the council urged
UNITA to proceed immediately with the orderly, large-scale and
verifiable movement of its troops to the quartering areas.
</P>
<P>
It also called upon the government of Angola and UNITA to
cease the dissemination of hostile propaganda.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Cyprus to Strengthen Cooperative Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis and visiting Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides pledged
here today to further strengthen the existing cooperative
relations between the two countries, in an effort to bring about a
permanent solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters this afternoon following a meeting
between the two leaders, Simitis said they discussed the joint
defence doctrine between Greece and Cyprus, which according to
Simitis constitutes "the dominant feature" in the course of the
two states.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the meeting took place in order to
review the course of the Cyprus problem and coordinate action in
an effort to bring about a permanent and just solution to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus president Clerides stressed the desire of both countries
to continue their close cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the proposed American initiative, the European
initiative as well as the good offices of U.N. chief Boutros
Boutros Ghali on the Cyprus issue, but stressed that the security
framework for the Cypriot people was set by Athens and Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
"Within this framework all deliberations on the Cyprus problem
will take place, independently of initiatives," Clerides told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Arrived here today for an official visit, Clerides also met
with Greek President Kostis Stephanopoulos.

<HEADLINE> Report: US to Send $100 Million Arms to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
considering transferring 100 million U.S. dollars in arms and
other military equipment to the Muslim and Croat-dominated Bosnian
federation, the Washington Post quoted American officials as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
The plan is part of a U.S. effort to help the federation to
counter Bosnia's Serbs once the 60,000-strong NATO peace
implementation forces pull out from the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is waiting on a final Pentagon
assessment of the Bosnian federtion's needs before it identifies
what type of weapons will be transferred.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that they have already decided to give the
federation large amounts of excess U.S. uniforms, including coats,
pants and shirts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army has been asked to see if it has weapons that
could be made available "with minimal impact on the Army's
operation," a defense official said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is also hoping to solicit money and equipment
from European and Muslim countries for the plan.
</P>
<P>
Washington has insisted that Muslims are victims of the
43-month bloody conflict in the Balkan State. About 250,000 people
were killed in the war, the worst in Europe since the World War
II.

LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister Dick
Spring Had talks with US President Bill Clinton in Washington
today in a bid to secure support for Ireland's proposal for the
Northern Ireland peace process, reported BBC TV this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Spring proposed on Wednesday in his talks with British Ulster
Secretary Patrick Mayhew that the two governments and political
parties hold proximity talks to break the impasse in the peace
process andd this proposal followed Clinton's idea of the
proximity talks which brought all Bosnia's warring groups to a
negotiating table in Dayton, Ohio last year.
</P>
<P>
Mayhew rejected this proposal, insisting that his government
favoured holding elections to a convention or assembly in Ulster
so as to pay the way for all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Clinton today, Spring said that Clinton had
been very supportive.
</P>
<P>
Spring explained that the plan would for all sides involved to
meet in the same building, rather than in the same room, for
intensive talks.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signed Telecommunications Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today signed a historic bill to change the way Americans receive
telephone, television and computer service.
</P>
<P>
"This law is truly revolutionary legislation that will bring
the future to our doorstep," the president said at a ceremony in
the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
The bill is a rewrite of 1934 Communications Act, which
President Franklin Roosevelt signed 62 years ago and opened
unimaginable doors of opportunity and lead the way to the
emergence of Ma Bell, television, the Internet, and much else to
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Under the new bill Clinton signed today, federal controls on
many cable TV rates will end in three years in large communities
such as the Washington D.C. area, in small communities they will
end immediately.
</P>
<P>
Television makers will be requested to install chips that
would let parents screen out violent shows; competitors will be
allowed to enter the now-monopolized local phone business. The
seven Bell companies will gradually be freed to enter the
now-forbidden long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
For on-line computing, criminal penalties will be imposed on
people or companies making certain indecent material available to
children on-line.

<HEADLINE> CBI Survey Fuels Evidence of Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Demand for manufactured goods
weakened in five out of 11 regions of Britain over the past three
months as some companies suffered their worst winter for three
years, a survey showed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A new Confederation of British Industry (CBI) quarterly survey
of the UK's regional industrial trends showed that poor domestic
demand and a sharp slowdown in export orders, as overseas market
conditions worsened, hit manufacturers in East Anglia, the north,
and Yorkshire and Humberside hardest.
</P>
<P>
The survey, published jointly with Business Strategies, the
consultancy, provided further confirmation of the slowdown in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Factory output fell or slowed in seven out of the 11 economic
regions of Britain in the three months to January, and companies
in all but one region, the south-west, said they expected to lay
off staff in the next four months.
</P>
<P>
Business confidence varies widely, the survey found. Companies
in only four regions, Northern Ireland, East Anglia, Scotland and
the east Midlands, said they were more optimistic now than four
months ago.

<HEADLINE> Likud, Tsomet Initial Election Bloc Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli opposition
parties, the Likud and Tsomet, today initialed an agreement to
run together in the upcoming general elections, which are likely
to be advanced to May.
</P>
<P>
Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu and Tsomet leader Rafael
Eitan signed on the revised agreement, allying their parties in a
joint list and common platform for the 14th Knesset (Israel's
parliament) elections.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Netanyahu was forced to renegotiate with Tsomet
after his own Knesset faction refused to approve the agreement
which two parties had worked out earlier.
</P>
<P>
It took five hours for Netanyahu and Eitan to iron out the
kinks which prevented the initialing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
In the end, it was agreed that neither of the two partners
would join a coalition without the other and that, through the
term of the 14th Knesset, neither party will withdraw from the
bloc.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said at a press conference after the signing
ceremony today in Tel Aviv that the agreement of the two parties
was a "revolution" for "the national camp" (right-wing factions)
in the Israeli politics.
</P>
<P>
"Division is not good for those who are divided in the
politics of Israel," he said, "and unification is good for those
who are united, and we have just been united."
</P>
<P>
However, not all the Likud members were happy about the
agreement, some strong opponents, like Knesset Members Dan Tichon
and Meir Sheetrit, even stayed away from the Likud's pre-signing
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the opposition to the agreement in his own party,
Netanyahu said that the agreement will prove itself in the very
near future and in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Eitan will get the second spot on the joint
ticket, and Tsomet would get seven places on the list up to the
42th slot, while, Tsomet will remain an independent party and keep
its own government financing.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the two parties resulted chiefly from
Likud efforts to end Eitan's candidacy for premier, which
Netanyahu viewed as particularly detrimental to his chances
against Israeli Prime Minister and Chairman of the Labor party
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that besides removing Eitan from the
prime ministerial race, the agreement is geared to giving the
opposition parties in the Knesset a morale boost, and its actual
electoral value is hard to gauge.
</P>
<P>
Eitan stressed at the press conference today that the aim of
the agreement is to maintain the two partners together before,
during and after the elections.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be signed and sealed after the central
committee of each party approves it, and work will now begin to
draft out a common policy platform which is expected to be made
public soon.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Peres told U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher during their meeting that the Knesset elections,
which were scheduled to be held on October 29, will be moved up
to May 28.

<HEADLINE> Heath Criticises Tory Privatisation "Dogma" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain's former prime
minister Sir Edward Heath has warned the Conservative
government against the "dogma" that everything could be
privatised, reported the Times today.
</P>
<P>
Heath criticised the idea of selling off prisons and the
Post Office on Wednesday in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He was particularly opposed to the provatisation of the
police, saying that "I think that's an absolute horror that
it should even be mentioned."
</P>
<P>
Heath said the government was seeking to dispose of
Britain's heritage with its plans for the Royal Yacht, the
Royal Train and the Greenwich Royal Naval College.
</P>
<P>
The government accused Labour of dogma while believing in
unlimited privatisation. "That is the real dogma", he told
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said that he opposed selling off the Post Office
because his constituents were against it.
</P>
<P>
"For the people, post offices were not just a service
dished out, as people at the top think. It is a way of life.
It means much more to them than just using stamps or drawing
pensions," he said.

Commenting on the U.S. initiative on the Cyprus problem,
following the cancellation of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Holbrooke's visit to the region, Pangalos said that
"Greece is willing to have talks with the U.S. provided they

<HEADLINE> US Cautious Over Slow Camping Of UNITA Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States Ambassador to
Angola, Donald Steimburg, said here today he was "disappointed"
over the slow pace of camping of former UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations peace monitors, only 8,200
UNITA armed soldiers had gathered at the U.N.-supervised
assembly camps.
</P>
<P>
UNITA leader Savimbi had earlier pledged to disarm 16,500 of his
estimated 60,000 troops ahead of Thursday's Security Council
decision on a three-month extension of U.N. peacekeeping mandate
in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. envoy said he was "happy" about Savimbi's
commitment to the camping plan.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community ought to bear part of the
responsibilities for the delay of the UNITA assembly in that some
of the assembly camps are short of logistic suppliers and funds.
</P>
<P>
However, Steimburg said the U.N.'s three-month extension of
Observers Mission in Angola is a "right decision".
</P>
<P>
"If the U.N. peacekeeping operation was to be trimmed down,
this country would be back at war within a month," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. operation costs one million US dollars a day and
hickups in the peace process have frustrated the international
community.
</P>
<P>
More than two million people have been displaced by the
Angolan civil war, which erupted on independence from Portugal in
1975, and aid groups provide food for about 1.1 million Angolans.
</P>
<P>
The government will incorporate 26,000 former rebels into a
new army, but ways of including UNITA's generals into the single
army are still being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
President Dos Santos has agreed to meet Savimbi outside Angola
for a fourth time to discuss organisation of an unity
government and a single army.

<HEADLINE> Amnesty International Warns Israel against Interrogation Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Amnesty International Pierre Sane warned today that Israel will
set a sinister precedent if it legalizes forms of torture against
Palestinian detainees.
</P>
<P>
Sane issued the warning during a meeting with Israeli Justice
Minister David Liba'i here, urging Israel to stop such legislation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following the meeting, Sane criticized
Israel's continued use of torture and other inhumane methods
in interrogating Palestinian detainees suspected of being
involved in violent attacks.
</P>
<P>
On the first visit ever by head of Amnesty International to
Israel in nine years, Sane said that he has come to the region to
ensure that human rights guarantees be respected by both Israel
and the Palestinians as the peace process advances.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that both Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) ban policies that violate human rights.
</P>
<P>
Israel must ban the use of torture against all the
detainees and revise open-fire guidelines established by the
military, he said, adding that administrative detention must
also be stopped and the Israeli authorities must ensure that the
trials are fair.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sane demanded that the PNA halt methods of torture
and put an end to arbitrary political arrests in the autonomous
areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he made a request that the PNA stop unfair trials
and abolish death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Sane and his delegation arrived here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation met with PNA President Yasser Arafat and four
Palestinian Council members in the Gaza Strip Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Sane warned that human rights can not be
ignored in the rush to attain peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was concerned that human rights issues
are being pushed aside in favor of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the priorities of the various parties,
their priority is peace, not human rights," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK's Small, Medium Firms Encouraged to Use Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
called on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to employ more
graduates, according to the news release issued by the Department
of Education and Employment.
</P>
<P>
Education and Employment Secretary Gillian Shephard said on
Wednesday that small and medium enterprises are the largest single
growth area in Britain and Graduates can bring a creative energy
and flexibility to these firms.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the +Better Business through People+ Conference at
the University of Sunderland, Shephard stressed that SMEs are
essential to Britain's international competitiveness, but they are
still a fairly untapped labour market for graduates.
</P>
<P>
Graduates can help SMEs sustain growth and they will also bring
contacts with universities, allowing companies to tap into their
resources. The universities will win from that too, she added.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, she went on, Graduates need to hit the ground
running when they start work. SMEs can offer an opportunity for
graduates to develop a broad range of experience which they can
take with them into other sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary said that it is needed to look at those
industries which have put graduates into what traditionally were
not graduate jobs and have exploited their potential by making
those jobs more important and more productive.
</P>
<P>
For an example, she said, the steel industry attributes much of
its economic success to a junior and middle management which is
increasingly staffed by graduates.
</P>
<P>
The increase in graduate numbers provides an opportunity for
employers to restructure work to take advantage of newly available
high level skills, he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of newly qualified graduates gaining first degrees
in Britain since 1979 has almost doubled. The graduation rate is
one of the highest in Europe, second only to Denmark within the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2001, the number of graduates in Britain's
workforce is projected to be well over three million. That is some
40 percent higher than in 1991, and twice as high as in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Government Urged To Control Unlicensed Trade Mark Posters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government
was urged today to establish a legal body to control unlicensed
trade mark and advertisement posters in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted Muhaba Muzeyin, Chairman of
the Trade Mark and Advertisement Licensing Committee of the Addis
Aababa Region, as saying that about 80 percent of trade mark and
advertisement placards placed at parking lots, cross roads and
squares of Addis Ababa were unlicensed.
</P>
<P>
Muhaba said even taxis bearing trade mark and advertisement
posters were marking business without obtaining licenses.
</P>
<P>
He said his committee was unable to either oversee or curb the
illegal business as there has been no advertisement proclamation
leading to measures against individuals and organizations involved
in the activities.
</P>
<P>
The government has lost a significant amount of revenue as
individuals and organizations failed to legalize their
advertisement, the chairman added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Eurotunnel Bankers Split over Refinancing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Bankers owed 8 billion pounds
(12 billion US dollars) by Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel
tunnel, are split over whether to take a hard line in negotiations
over Eurotunnel's crucial refinancing, Financial Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel has been in talks with its 225 banks about a
refinancing since it suspended interest payments on its 8 billion
pounds of debt in September last year.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the negotiations have been with the six banks in
the so-called steering group, National Westminster, Midland,
Credit Lyonnais, Banque Nationale de Paris, the European
Investment Bank and the European Coal and Steel Community.
</P>
<P>
A hardline group of banks, the "hawks", was insisting that it
should eventually receive full repayment of principal and
interest, together with penalties for late payment.
</P>
<P>
A more moderate group of banks, the "doves", had accepted the
need to take some of the pain and was prepared to negotiate with
the company about the level of debt or interest forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
The company had suggested schemes to its bankers which would
reduce its debts to such a level that it could meet its interest
payments on a daily basis in about 10 years' time, negotiators
said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed solution involves the company using its cash flow
over the next 10 years to pay down the debt rather than the
interest due on it.
</P>
<P>
The unpaid interest would be dealt with through a number of
possible methods, such as conversion of interest payments into
shares, the issue of equity-type instruments, including a possible
share issue, etc.
</P>
<P>
However, several hawks among the leading banks are said to be
holding out against agreeing to such a plan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the disagreement means Eurotunnel is likely
to tell its shareholders soon that any resolution of its financial
crisis is still a long way off.

<HEADLINE> More Americans Own Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The rate of Americans buying
houses was higher last year than any time since 1981, according to
the latest figures from the country's Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the last three months of 1995, 65.1 percent of U.S.
households owned their homes, according to the figures carried by
the newspaper "USA Today".
</P>
<P>
That is nearly 1 percentage point higher than a year ago. And
"it means 1 million people moved from being renters to owners,"
said Michael Carliner, economist at the National Association of
Home Builders.
</P>
<P>
It was the highest rate since 65.2 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1981. The rate fell to 63.5 percent in the
correspondent quarter of 1985.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the increase to declining mortgage rates
and more positive lending from banks.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage rates are at two-year lows. This week, 30-year
fixed-rate mortgages averaged 6.98 percent, down from 9.10 percent
at the beginning of 1995, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
It said that banks have been under pressure to lend to
low-income borrowers. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, banks
are required to meet the credit needs of all the neighborhoods in
which they do business. This has spurred banks to offer more
flexible loans. Low-down-payment mortgages, it said, are
increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
In addition, many people born in the mid-1950s, years of baby
booming, delayed buying a home until now, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the surge in homeownership has been driven by
first-time buyers. After declining since 1981, homeownership rose
last year for Americans under the age of 50, the paper reported.

<HEADLINE> Credit-Card Fraud Ring Broken in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A New York district attorney
announced Wednesday an indictment of eight people who run the
largest credit-card fraud ring in the United States, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ring had a highly structured operation with contacts
throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. It stole credit
cards, made its own and assumed the credit identities of thousands
of unsuspecting card holders, said Queens District Attorney
Richard Brown on announcing the indictment.
</P>
<P>
In ten months the organization stole 650,000 U.S. dollars in
goods and cash advances and had credit-card numbers with access to
8 million dollars, the New York Times quoted officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The indictment was made after five-month investigation
conducted by state, federal and city law enforcement officers
following the arrests last September of the Nigerian ring master,
Olushina Godwin Adekanbi, and his ring members.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the arrested crime group members face up to 25
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Investigators has found a mini-credit-card factory at
Adekandi's home, seized hundreds of stolen and counterfeit Visa,
Mastercard, American Express and Discover credit cards. Equipment
to make counterfeit cards was also recovered.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that banks and credit card companies lose an
estimated 3 billion dollars worldwide each year from counterfeit
and stolen credit cards.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Over 120 Million People Infected with Filariasis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 120 million people in
73 countries are infected with filarial parasites, which can cause
lymphatic filariasis resulting in permanent and long-term
disability, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently
reported.
</P>
<P>
In much of Asia, Africa and the Western Pacific, as well as in
certain regions of the Americas, said WHO in a report, the
mosquito-borne disease persists as a major cause of clinical
morbidity.
</P>
<P>
It is listed as the world's second leading cause of permanent
and long-term disability. WHO also reported growth in cases of the
disease chiefly as result of rapid unplanned urbanization in many
endemic areas, despite of availability of safe and cost-effective
methods to control and eliminate it.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO report, filarial parasites can lead to
damage to the lymphatic ducts. Among the resulting disease is
elephantiasis, which causes one or more limbs to become grossly
swollen and covered with sores.
</P>
<P>
Infection with filarial parasites can also cause acute fevers,
inflammation of the lymphatic system, and the bronchial-asthmatic
condition known as tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE).
</P>
<P>
In addition, WHO said that lymphatic filariasis has already
been identified by the International Task Force for Disease
Eradication as one of the world's six "eradicable" or "potentially
eradicable" infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
According to the world health body, the goal could be achieved
through the two general strategies of chemotherapy programs and
vector control activities with a view to reduce transmission.
</P>
<P>
Through mass distribution among populations of drugs against
the parasite, reducing mosquito populations and other measures,
Japan, Chinese Taiwan and South Korea have eliminated lymphatic
filariasis and China has seen a dramatic reduction in infection
levels during the past decade, WHO added.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Consultations Held in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States
described as useful the three-day political talks held here on
February 5-7 between their vice foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
During the consultations, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Li
Zhaoxing and his U.S. counterpart, Undersecretary of State for
Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff, had a frank and serious exchange
of views on Sino-U.S. relations and international issues of mutual
concern.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agree that a broad range of common interests
exists between the two countries and that a stable and healthy
development of bilateral relations is not only in their
fundamental interest, but also conducive to peace, stability and
development in the Asia-Pacific area as well as the world.
</P>
<P>
Both sides believe the consensus reached between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton at their New
York meeting last October, that Sino-U.S. relations should be
viewed strategically and with an eye toward the 21st century, will
shape the development of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are pleased with recent progress and cooperation in
a number of areas and they hope that joint efforts will be made to
improve and expand bilateral relations in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhaoxing made it clear that Taiwan remains the most
sensitive and important issue in Sino-U.S. relations and will
determine whether the relationship will develop smoothly this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side demands that the U.S. side strictly adhere to
the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and handle the Taiwan issue
with care so as to avoid reviving tensions in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Peter Tarnoff said U.S. policy towards China is one of
"comprehensive engagement" and not "containment." The U.S. side
hopes to work with China in constructive cooperation for a stable
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the U.S. side understands the importance and
sensitivity of the Taiwan issue. He reaffirmed that the United
States will continue its "One China" policy, abide by the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques, oppose Taiwan's entry into the United
Nations and its independence.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, the Chinese vice foreign minister also
met with other senior U.S. government officials, including Samuel
Berger, acting Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs, Strobe Talbott, acting Secretary of State, Lynn Davis,
Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International
Security Affairs, Walter Slocombe, Undersecretary of Defense, John
Holcom, Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and
Charlene Barshafsky, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today called for a decent voter turnout in the general
elections scheduled for March 16-17.
</P>
<P>
"If there is voter apathy, it will be misinterpreted by the
international community," Mugabe, who is also the leader of the
ruling Zanu (PF) party, told 7,000 supporters in a rally in Mount
Darwin, 160 km north of Harare.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that I will win but it is not much of the
winning that matters, but that we should turn up in our
millions," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Mugabe said Zanu (PF) must ensure there was no voter
apathy in the presidential elections, which will also be
contested by opposition Zanu (Ndonga) leader Ndabaningi Sithole
and United Parties leader Abel Muzorewa.
</P>
<P>
Only 57 percent of registered voters cast their ballots in
last year's parliamentary elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- British Telecommunications (BT)
and RWE and Viag, two of Germany's largest industrial groups, plan
to spend about 1.5 billion pounds (2.3 billion US dollars)
building a German telephone network over the next four or five
years.
</P>
<P>
The investment, which is expected to be mainly in
infrastructure and will be divided broadly equally between the
three groups, was disclosed Wednesday as the companies confirmed
plans to create a third consortium vying for position in the
German telecom market, Europe's largest.
</P>
<P>
The three groups signed a letter of intent to work on the
provision of the full range of telecom services to corporate and
residential clients.
</P>
<P>
BT said that the alliance's goal was to capture 10-15 percent
of the German market over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The consortium will compete with Deutsche Telekom, the state
telecommunications group that will lose its monopoly in 1998,and a
second alliance of companies which includes Veba and Mannesmann of
Germany, AT and T of the US and Cable and Wireless of the UK.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Not Qualified to Lecture China on Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States, which has the
world's largest and most advanced nuclear arsenal, is in no
position to lecture China on its nuclear testing, Chinese
Disarmament Ambassador Sha Zukang said in Geneva today.
</P>
<P>
Sha made the statement in an impromptu speech at today's
session of the Conference on Disarmament after U.S. Representative
Stephen J. Ledogar criticized China for its nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador told the meeting: "As known to all, it
is the United States that possesses today the largest and most
advanced nuclear arsenal in the world. It will still be the
United States that possesses the largest and most advanced nuclear
arsenal even after its implementation of the START II treaty in
2003.
</P>
<P>
"And it has been the United States that for all the past
decades stuck to its policy of nuclear deterrence based on its
first use of nuclear weapons against all other countries. Owing
to these reasons, the United States is not qualified to point its
finger to China's extremely limited number of nuclear tests."
</P>
<P>
Looking back on history, the Chinese ambassador drew attention
to the fact that the international community has since the 1950s
demanded the cessation of all nuclear tests. Yet the Conference
on Disarmament was only able to set up the Nuclear Test Ban Ad Hoc
Committee and start negotiations on a Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) several years ago.
</P>
<P>
"How many nuclear tests were conducted by the United States
during these decades? " asked Sha.
</P>
<P>
"For all these years, whenever the United States chose to test,
it would not allow test ban negotiations. And now, when the
negotiations have started, the United States is demanding all
other countries to follow the American approach and timetable and
making irresponsible comments on the extremely limited number of
nuclear tests of others."
</P>
<P>
At the session, the Chinese ambassador reiterated China's
support for a quick completion of the CTBT no later than 1996,
adding that meanwhile, China wishes to "conclude a good CTBT that
is acceptable to all parties so as to achieve an early entry into
force of the treaty."
</P>
<P>
"Proceeding from this position, the Chinese delegation has all
along objected to the attitude of political expediency of some
delegations toward the CTBT negotiations" and opposed the
imposition of domestic political factors by certain countries onto
the multilateral treaty negotiations, Sha said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China has conducted only a limited number of
nuclear tests and has exercised utmost restraint on testing.
</P>
<P>
"China has never intended nor it will continue nuclear testing
indefinitely. Once the CTBT enters into force, China will cease
all nuclear testing", he added.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The UN special envoy to
Afghanistan, Mehmud Mestiri, held talks today with Afghan faction
leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in the eastern Afghan city of
Jalalabad.
</P>
<P>
During Mestiri's day-long visit to Jalalabad, "both sides
expressed unanimous opinion on many issues," Hekmatyar's aide
Ghairat Baheer was quoted as saying by the Associated Press of
Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
He said Hekmatyar, chief of his own faction of Hezb-i-Islami,
told Mestiri that both the Kabul government and the Taliban
militia are preparing for another showdown.
</P>
<P>
But "Hezb has not yet decided to support which of the two," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We will take position later," said Hekmatyar's son-in-law who
also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said Hezb wants a peaceful settlement of the conflict and
hopes for the formation of a mutually acceptable interim set-up
which should undertake to arrange general elections for the future
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Allauddin Broujerdi
and Rashid Dostum, chief of Junbush-e-Milli Afghanistan who
controls northern Afghanistan, held talks on the Afghan peace

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
here today that Britain has handed over one of its research
stations in the Antarctic to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the two government reached in 1995,
Ukraine promised to ensure the Faraday station would continue to
be used for scientific research, the British Antarctic Survey said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ukraine has agreed to provide British scientists
free data for at least ten years, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Faraday station, oldest of Britain's oldest research stations
in the Antarctic, has been used for studying weather, the Earth's
magnetic field and the ozone layer since its was set up in 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol on protection of the Antarctic environment
reached recently, old stations must be dismantled and removed.
</P>
<P>
The handover would save one million pounds (about 1.5 million
U.S. dollars) in dismantling costs.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- China faces severe challenges
in this summer's Olympic Games in Atlanta, the United States, with
very few sports capable of bringing any medals, a Chinese sports
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhitao, deputy director of the Training Bureau of the
State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, made the comment
before a delegation he led left here for home this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zhang picked up table tennis, gymnastics, diving and shooting
out of the nine events under his administration in their
preparations for the Atlanta Olympics. "And we are stronger in
some events in athletics, badminton, swimming and weightlifting."
</P>
<P>
He blamed the decline of badminton in China as a result of
succession of old, experienced coaches by younger ones. "But
we're recovering," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China has been qualified for all Olympic events
except men's basketball.
</P>
<P>
The official declined to elaborate on the gold medal target if
any for the Chinese Olympic teams. "Of course we want to win and
win more, but things change all the time and every factor in
between could affect the performance of our athletes in Atlanta,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
And he confirmed that, according to the regulations set by the
sports commission, China's Olympic medal winners at the Atlanta
Games would be awarded with prize money. "But we've not figured
out how much they should be," he said.

<HEADLINE> Three Percent of Thai Workers at Health Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- About 150,000 out of five
million industrial workers in Thailand nationwide are at risk of
contracting occupational illnesses caused mainly by polluted
working environments, according to a health expert.
</P>
<P>
Leaks and diffusion of toxic substances such as lead, textile
and silicon dust in factories are the major health threats to
industrial workers, said Oraphan Methadilokkul, president of the
National Occupational and Environmental Medicine Association.
</P>
<P>
However, she told an annual meeting of the association
Wednesday that medical treatment is available to only one percent
of them, or about 1,500 people per year.
</P>
<P>
Medical treatment for job-related patients is scarce because of
the limited number of doctors specializing in occupational health.
</P>
<P>
Most patients are forced to consult general practitioners and
are treated for immediate symptoms such as headaches and muscle
pain.
</P>
<P>
This is not effective because it does not deal with the root
cause of job-related sicknesses, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Most of the patients who seek treatment of their job-related
sicknesses are textile factory workers infected with byssinosis
which causes chest pain resulting from textile dust residue in the
lungs.
</P>
<P>
Many others are infected with lead poisoning in electric
factories.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of occupation-related illness cases have led
to an increasing amount of litigation between factories and
workers.

<HEADLINE> EC Sets Definition for European SMEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
tried to clear up confusion over what constitutes small and
medium-sized enterprises (SME) by issuing a definition of the
terms.
</P>
<P>
From now on, a "medium-sized" enterprise is one with between 50
and 250 employees and annual turnover of less than 40 million ECU
(52 million U.S. dollars) or balance sheet assets of under 27
million ECU.
</P>
<P>
A "small" enterprise must have fewer than 50 employees and an
annual turnover under 7 million ECU (9 million dollars) or a
balance sheet under 5 million ECU.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises with fewer than ten employees will be considered
"very small".
</P>
<P>
A further basic distinction of an SME is that a large
enterprise cannot hold a stake of more than 25 per cent of the
business.
</P>
<P>
"This definition gives the SMEs an opportunity to benefit from
better targeted Community actions and initiatives under a common
and coherent definition based on a combination of several
criteria," said an EC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
An official definition will also avoid "the creation of any
inconsistencies or distortion of competition".
</P>
<P>
The definition also provides a reference framework for EC
programs, policies and legislations concerning SMEs.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the great disparities currently existing among
member nations, these recommended thresholds are only maximum
ceilings.
</P>
<P>
"There is the need to allow for some flexibility so that local
and regional circumstances can be taken into consideration," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A variety of measures targetted at SMEs have been introduced in
recent years, both at EU and at national levels.
</P>
<P>
But the lack of a common definition of an SME meant some of the
financial benefits intended for SMEs went to large enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Water, Power Supplies Restored in Lijiang Quake Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kunming, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Water and power supplies in
earthquake-hit Lijiang County in southwest China's Yunnan Province
were restored today thanks to the army's assistance.
</P>
<P>
An emergency team of soldiers working with locals spent three
days repairing water pipelines and power lines, with the problem
of more than a thousand aftershocks endangering their efforts.
</P>
<P>
When their work was accomplished, 70,000 residents of Lijiang
were able to use tap water today.
</P>
<P>
No new casualties were reported today and the death toll stood
at 255, while most of the 3,800 seriously injured had taken a turn
for the better.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures show that losses were estimated at more than
4.2 billion yuan in Lijiang alone and that more than 14,000 people
were injured and 340,000 houses or buildings destroyed.
</P>
<P>
All foreign tourists in Lijiang County have been confirmed
safe, and only one, an American girl, was slightly injured on the
head by flying debris.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that various organizations and people
from both China and abroad have donated either cash or relief
goods to the area.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial government, a total of more than 83
million yuan and 150 tons of emergency goods from other
regions have so far been donated for disaster-relief work.
</P>
<P>
Some 640,000 yuan worth of medicines donated by the Red Cross
societies of Hong Kong and Taiwan were delivered to Lijiang today
by a team from the Red Cross Society of China, led by Sun Baiqiu,
vice-president of RCSC.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that more than 200,000 residents in Lijiang
are still living outside because of housing damage and
aftershocks, and the supply of daily necessities is insufficient,
although the provincial government has helped transport more than
300 tons of emergency goods to the area.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- China faces severe challenges
in their preparations for this summer's Olympic Games in Atlanta,
USA, with very few sports capable of bringing any medals, a
Chinese sports official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhitao, deputy director of the Training Bureau of the
State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, made the comment
before a delegation he led left here for home this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zhang picked up table tennis, gymnastics, diving and shooting
out of the nine events under his administration in their
preparations for the Atlanta Olympics. "And we are stronger in
some events in athletics, badminton, swimming and weightlifting."
</P>
<P>
He blamed the decline of badminton in China as a result of
succession of old, experienced coaches by younger ones. "But
we're recovering," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China has been qualified for all Olympic events
except men's basketball.
</P>
<P>
The official declined to elaborate on the gold medal target if
any for the Chinese Olympic teams. "Of course we want to win and
win more, but things change all the time and every factor in
between could affect the performance of our athletes in Atlanta,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
And he confirmed that, according to the regulations set by the
sports commission, China's Olympic medal winners at the Atlanta
Games would be awarded with prize money. "But we've not figured
out how much they should be," he said.

<HEADLINE> Techniques Promoting Farming Sector in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Agro-science has helped the Tibet
Autonomous Region to reap bumper grain crops, the eighth good
harvest in a row, a local government official has reported.
</P>
<P>
The official with the Regional Agricultural Department said
that agro-science has increased the region's total grain
production by 24 percent to 700 million kg.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Tibet Institute of Agricultural Science
have developed and spread new techniques for the selecting and
breeding of fine seeds. They have also devised new farming
techniques.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have also bred seeds which can grow well in the
cold and dry areas of Tibet and introduced many fine seeds from
other countries with ecological conditions similar to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The institute has now developed 208 varieties of new seeds, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the region has 95 varieties of fine seeds sown on
over 130,000 hectares of farmland, he said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the suburbs of the regional capital of Lhasa and
Xigaze, a major city in Tibet, are planting potatos and corn in
the same fields. Output from one hectare of such fields is worth
102,000 yuan, 61,200 yuan more than fields planted with only one
crop, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The institute has also taught local farmers how to make and use
organic fertilizers and manures.
</P>
<P>
He said that farmers applied an average of 30,000 kg of such
fertilizers on every hectare in the Xigaze Prefecture. As a
result, the region reported a record harvest of 290 million kg.
</P>
<P>
Local agricultural departments have paid great attention to the
spreading of agro-science, he said.
</P>
<P>
Agro-science and technology spreading centers have been set up
in more than a dozen cities and counties including Doilungdeqen,
Nedong and Nyingchi counties.

<HEADLINE> EC Expresses Support to EU Administrator of Mostar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today expressed its full support for Hans Koschnick, the EU
administrator of the divided Bosnian town of Mostar, and appealed
to the Bosnian Croat leadership to accept his plan for new
municipal boundaries within Mostar.
</P>
<P>
Koschnick's car was attacked Wednesday by angry Croat
demonstrators protesting against his plan to redraw the city's
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
The violence erupted after Koschnick announced his decision on
the future structure of the city following the failure of Moslems
and Croats agree on boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Koschnick said Mostar would be divided into six districts,
three Moslem and three Croat, with the center of the town a
neutral territory. But Croat officials said the plan favored
Mostar's Moslem inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
The EC expressed "great regret" at the "serious harassment" of
its official whose car was attacked outside the EU's offices in
the city. Protesters jumped on the car and tried to flip it over.
</P>
<P>
The EC statement said Koschnick's decision was made with the
authority given to him under the Memorandum of Understanding
establishing the EU Administration in Mostar which was signed by
all parties concerned in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
The EC appealed to the Bosnian Croat leadership to exert its
influence to prevent reoccurrence of similar acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
"The Bosnian Croats should realize that they not only endanger
the future of Mostar, but also seriously threaten the foundations
of the Federation," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The EU fears that a breakdown in communications between the EU
and the two communities in Mostar could irreparably damage the
fragile Moslem-Croat federation created in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Industry Up 16.9 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial output for
last month reached 129.9 billion yuan, up 16.9 percent over the
same month last year, announced the State Statistics Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
State-owned companies and enterprises with the state as major
shareholder completed 77.8 billion yuan worth of industrial output
in January, up 11.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Collectively-owned enterprises had 38.8 billion yuan worth of
industrial output last month, up 20.7 percent over the same month
last year, while the private sector had 23.4 billion yuan worth of
industrial output, up 16.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last month, China's output value for light industry was 54.3
billion yuan, compared with 75.6 billion yuan for heavy
industry. The two sectors grew 17.8 percent and 16 percent
respectively over the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Primary energy production in January hit 94 million tons of
standard coal, 13.7 percent more than the same month last
year. China produced 101 million tons of coal last month, 17.1
percent more than in January of 1995.
</P>
<P>
China saw a steady growth in raw materials production last
month, a report by the bureau said, while rolled steal production
grew 5.1 percent. Copper and aluminum production rose 15.6 percent
and 31.2 percent respectively in January over the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
Chemical products and tractors, fertilizers also witnessed
quick growth last month.
</P>
<P>
The bureau pointed out that the major problem last month was
decreased efficiency in marketing. Last month the sales rate
against production was 91.65 percent, 0.53 percentage points lower
than the same month of 1995. The sales rate against production for
light industry dropped 1.87 percentage points from that of a year
ago to 89.92 percent.

<HEADLINE> Round-table Meeting Called for on Bangladesh's political  crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's business apex body
today called for a round-table conference to be held under the
country's president to discuss the prevailing political crisis
over the contentious coming elections.
</P>
<P>
At an emergency meeting of its executive committee, the
Federation of Bangladeshi Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(FBCCI) proposed that the president initiate the conference with
people from all walks of life attending.
</P>
<P>
Those to be invited to the proposed round-table meeting on a
solution to the political crisis should include the country's
political leadership, professionals, lawyers, doctors, engineers,
representatives of non-governmental organizations, businessmen,
academicians, civil servants and security forces, the FBCCI said.
</P>
<P>
In the present situation in the country, not only was all
economic activity being stifled, but the country was being divided
sharply along the partisan line, the FBCCI leaders said. The
country's economy had already been badly impaired and the coming
February 15 national elections would not lead to political
stability, they added.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has got ready for
the polls together with some small parties. But the mainstream
opposition parties have boycotted the election process from the
very beginning, as their demand for the election to be held under
a neutral caretaker government has not been met.
</P>
<P>
The FBCCI said there was still enough time for everyone to make
the necessary effort to come together at a round-table conference
and try to resolve the current crisis, although there are only
eight days to go before polling day.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on the Role of Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Running the country in
accordance with the law is significant for sound economic and
social development in China and national stability, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Increasing the role of law in running the country, an important
part of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, is an important principle of managing state
affairs, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a lecture on law here today held by the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, attended by dozens of
senior party officials including Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Liu Huaqing
and Hu Jintao.
</P>
<P>
The lecture was delivered by Wang Jiafu, a 63-year-old
professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the lecture, Jiang said that China has made great
progress in legal construction since 1978, with legislative work
having been sped up to formulate a series of laws and regulations
on politics, economy, culture, and social life.
</P>
<P>
However, Jiang said, the current situation still lags behind
the needs of China's modernization drive and needs to be improved.
</P>
<P>
China is establishing a socialist market economy, a move that
should go along with a comprehensive legal system that is suited
to the market mechanism and the country's actual conditions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
As both the economy and society develop, new problems will
emerge, so it is necessary to keep improving and strengthening the
legal system, Jiang said, emphasizing that it is necessary to make
the public aware of the law so that they will stick to the law and
safeguard state interests as well as their own rights and
interests in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also urged officials at all levels to acquire more
knowledge about the law to increase their ability to manage
economic and social affairs legally.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Loses to Bangkok in GM Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has lost to
Thailand in biding a one-billion-US-dollar investment of General
Motors (GM) Corp. of the United States, which filed an application
with Bangkok's Board of Investments last week.
</P>
<P>
News about the GM application disappointed the Philippine
government, which has prepared a special incentive package to lure
the US automaker, and government officials today sought to
downplay it.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Melito Salazar quoted
visiting GM executives as saying, "the Philippines is still very
much in the running."
</P>
<P>
Salazar today accompanied the GM officials to check possible
plant sites in Alaminos, Pangasinan and Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac
province.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos recently wrote to John Smith, GM's
chairman and chief executive officer, to make another pitch for
the project.
</P>
<P>
Among the incentives dangled by Manila are an income tax break,
duty-free importation of capital equipment, tax credit on local
purchases of capital goods, exemption from real estate tax and
possibly, rent-free use of land for three to five years.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the GM plans to pursue a different
project in the Philippines, but reports interpreted the GM
application in Bangkok as an indication that Manila had lost to
its ASEAN partner.
</P>
<P>
An AP-Dow Jones report, quoting an official of Thailand's BOI,
said the GM had filed an application to build a 500 million US
dollars plant there.
</P>
<P>
The proposed facility will assemble 180,000 cars a year and
could require up to one billion US dollars in investments.
</P>
<P>
The GM is choosing between the Philippines and Thailand the
site of its Asian manufacturing base.
</P>
<P>
Because of the huge investment involved, both countries have
tried to outdo each other in the granting of incentives.
</P>
<P>
Even at the onset, the odds heavily favored Thailand, according
to some industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
They said that Bangkok has the largest car market in the region
and is a neighbor of most of Asia's emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
Top GM executives who visited the country last year reportedly
favor locating a former Vietnamese refugee center in Bataan
province.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Ice Hockey Side Takes Silver in Winter Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, China, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Akihito Sugisawa and
Makoto Kawahira each hit two goals to pace Japan to a 7-1 victory
over China, taking the men's ice hockey silver medal at the Winter
Asiad on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan had grabbed the gold medal by trouncing the win-less
South Koreans 9-1 in its last game early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, making a debut to the games which drew only four
ice hockey teams, won all the three matches in the round-robin
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Runner-up Japan, who placed sixth in the World Championship
Group B, proved its power in its lopsided win over defending
China, who was fifth at the World Championship Group C.
</P>
<P>
Forward Sugisawa gave the Japanese a 2-0 lead by scoring
one goal apiece in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
Then Kawahira added two straight goals to widen the Japan's
leading margin to 4-0 in the third period.
</P>
<P>
After Japan shot its fifth goal, the Chinese six, cheered on by
a home crowd in the 5,000-seat Harbin Ice Hockey Rink, used a
break-fast offense to find the net through Zhang Fengyuan with
3:20 to play.
</P>
<P>
Japan answered with two more goals in four minutes.
</P>
<P>
China placed third with one win against two defeats, with South
Korea fourth.
</P>
<P>
The three-team women's ice hockey tournament will start on
Friday with Kazakhstan against Japan.

<HEADLINE> Fire Destroys Refugee Camp In South Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Three people died and nine
others were wounded in a refugee camp in southern Mogadishu
Wednesday night when a huge fire gushed into their huts.
</P>
<P>
So far there are no aid agencies coming to the rescue of the
destroyed refugee camp, where 183 houses of nearly 915 people
were lost to the fire which lasted for more than five hours.
</P>
<P>
Neither was here any sign of fire services whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
Some of the seriously wounded were sent to a nearby hospital
by other homeless refugees who were now cleaning the debris in an
effort to install new homes.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Abdinasir, chairman of the camp, which has altogether
718 houses, today told reporters that the fire was caused by
children who were trying to cook food outside their hut.
</P>
<P>
"They left the fire open and during the windy season it easily
caught their houses and then spread to the nearby ones," said
Abdinasir.
</P>
<P>
The worst hit family was Aden Gab's, who died for his effort
to rescue his family. His three-year-old son, Osman Abdi, also
died in the fire.
</P>
<P>
Gab's wife, Habiba Ahere, and her youngest child are now left
unconsciously in a hospital after being trapped by the fire in
their hut at the corner of the camp.
</P>
<P>
According to the camp official, only neighbors of the camp
came out with buckets, blankets and sand to distinguish the fire.
</P>
<P>
Abdinasir said he had visited several aid agencies such as the
French aid agency AICF and some U.N. agencies including UNICEF,
but none had responded to the camp's needs as yet even though
they made pledges of assistance.
</P>
<P>
Refugees of the camp, which situates in the old Coca-Cola
factory near the 21 October Parade Ground, were earlier fed by a
Saudi Arabian aid agency, Rabida Al-Almai Al-Islamia.
</P>
<P>
But the camp depended on no agency since the international
community withdrew from Somalia early March, 1995.
</P>
<P>
These internally displaced people have been in the camp since
1992. They came mainly from the districts of Baidoa and Kismayu
during the height of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
They not only suffer from the lack of food but also face
sanitation problems since they don't have latrines.
</P>
<P>
The refugees also suffer from inadequate shelter, potable
water and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria.

BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Waigaoqiao Bonded

American Depositary Receipts (ADR) Program in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Starting today, Waigaoqiao's ADRs will be traded

Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) told Xinhua in a telephone

</P>
<P>
Waigaoqiao will use no more than half of its B-shares, which
are targeted at foreign investors, to build the ADR program. One
Waigaoqiao ADR represents five B-shares, and carries a moderate
price.
</P>
<P>
Building ADR programs in the United States is intended to
strengthen overseas influence of Chinese companies that issue
B-shares, to help them raise funds on the international capital
market, analysts here point out.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Not to Beg Peace From Dudayev: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
is working on ways to settle the Chechen conflict but will not beg
Chechnya's separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev for peace, Yeltsin's
Press Secretary Sergei Medvedev said here today.
</P>
<P>
"President Boris Yeltsin is not a man to humbly ask Dzhokhar
Dudayev for peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev made the remarks a few minutes after Yeltsin told
reporters in the Kremlin that he had ordered Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin to come up with an acceptable peace plan to settle
the conflict in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"We have seven variants on how to end the war in Chechnya,"
said Yeltsin, who gave Chernomyrdin two weeks to work out a plan.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev told reporters that the Wednesday meeting of the
Russian Security Council focused on the Chechen issue and that
Yeltsin "is ready to sign any appeal for ending the war in
Chechnya," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, a withdrawal of Russian troops from the region could
lead to a heightening of tension, he warned.
</P>
<P>
"Soldiers with submachine-guns will go, but rebels with
submachine-guns will stay, and they will use their
weapons...against civilians," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Neither Grigory Yavlinsky (leader of the Yabloko bloc),
nor...other politicians can tell what the result of the troops'
withdrawal from Chechnya will be.
</P>
<P>
"This is why the president is in no hurry to take resolute
steps, because he is analyzing all possible consequences of the
troops' withdrawal," Medvedev added.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky and several other prominent Russians have called on
the president to take urgent steps to end the war in Chechnya
which has lasted more than a year.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 65, has made it clear that if the war continues, he
has no chance of winning the presidential elections scheduled for
June 16.
</P>
<P>
Although he has so far stopped short of a formal announcement
of his intention to run for his second term of office, but few
people doubt that he plans to enter the race. His peace initiative
is widely seen as paving the way for his bid.

XI'AN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Niu Maosheng, minister of water
resources, has paid a two-day visit to Dali County of northwest
China's Shaanxi Province, an area that has been hit by ice floods
on the Yellow River since January.
</P>
<P>
Acting on behalf of Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun, who is also a
member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party, Niu and his team inspected the disaster area and
expressed concern for victims yesterday and today.
</P>
<P>
Because of the accumulation of ice in the river, the section
flowing through Dali has burst dams in several places since late
January, with ice floods inundating more than 13,000 ha of
farmland and affecting the lives of over 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Central authorities have been paying much attention to the
flooded areas, and Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun demanded that local
governments relocate flood victims and handle the flood situation
properly.
</P>
<P>
Over 7,000 civilians and servicemen stationed locally have
participated in rescue work in both Dali and Weinan city, another
flood-stricken area. Aircraft from an air force base in
neighboring Gansu Province have helped to break up the ice in the
main course of the river, which was cleared as of press time.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- People from all walks of life
in Hong Kong have shown their concern and care for the quake
victims of China's Yunnan Province by donating money and materials
to aid the relief and reconstruction efforts in the
quake-stricken area of the province.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Xinhua News Agency HK Branch said that by this
noon the branch has received donated relief funds of over 63
million HK dollars (8.15 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
This include 50 million HK dollars (6.47 million US dollars)
from Ho Ying-chie, chairman of Hong Kong Tobacco Co. Ltd., and 10
million HK dollars (1.29 million US dollars) from Li Ka-shing,
head of Cheung Kong (Holdings).
</P>
<P>
Ho Ying-chie, 86, had donated huge sums of money to
disaster-stricken people in the mainland several times before. In
1991, he donated 54 million HK dollars (6.99 million US dollars)
to the seriously-flooded areas in east China; and last year when
Yunnan was shaken by strong earthquakes, he donated 50 million HK
dollars for the people there to build new homes.
</P>

<HEADLINE> hke020874-- News Analysis: APEC to Shape Future at Manila Meeting (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum will shape its future in its leaders'
informal meeting to be held here in November, economic analysts
predicted today.
</P>
<P>
If it succeeds, it could put pressure on the European Union
(EU) to dismantle tariff and non-tariff barriers to free trade,
thus hastening the global liberalization of trading arrangements,
according to the analysts.
</P>
<P>
Professor Julius Caesar Parrenas of the University of Asia and
Pacific said today: "It will be a test of whether APEC is going to
be successful."
</P>
<P>
Parrenas, who is on a team of economists advising the
government, warned that the grouping could lose momentum and
degenerate into a "talkers' club" unless the 18 member economies
match their rhetoric on free trade with concrete actions.
</P>
<P>
Since commitments are carried out on a best efforts basis, the
analysts said, the APEC members cannot be compelled to open their
economies sooner than they want to.
</P>
<P>
It is their economic interests that will push them to bat for
the success, they added.
</P>
<P>
At last year's meeting in Osaka, the APEC leaders approved an
action agenda, which sets 1997 as the start of the liberalization
measures.
</P>
<P>
Member economies are to submit no later than November this year
individual action plans outlining specific measures toward
creating a regional free trade area by 2020.
</P>
<P>
Parrenas said that if the APEC leaders' informal meeting is
successful, that would put a lot of pressure on the Europeans to
liberalize.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which protects its agriculture and garments and
textiles sector with high tariff walls and generous subsidies,
could not afford to disregard calls for freer trade.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders are preparing for a first ever meeting with 10 Asian
countries' leaders in March in a bid to forge a broad economic and
political partnership with the world's most dynamic region.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li Peng Meets With French Foreign Minister (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He pointed out that China and France complement each other
economically, in spite of the fact that they are at different
development levels and have their own advantages and demands.
</P>
<P>
He said that France has strengths and technical advantages in
some fields that are important to China's economic development,
and that the two have cooperated well in the power industry and
have good prospects in other fields, such as aviation.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government will encourage its enterprises to
expand economic, trade, and scientific exchanges and cooperation
with France, and we hope French enterprises will take steps to
increase their competitiveness, in order to have a bigger share of
the China market," Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
De Charette expressed his thanks for Li's remarks and positive
attitude towards French-Chinese economic and trade cooperation,
and added, "China's development bears global significance. France

to participate in China's economic development in various forms."
</P>
<P>
French industrialists and business leaders present at the
meeting also expressed their hope for continued equal and mutually
beneficial economic and trade relations.
</P>

As for the international situation, Li said that contradictions
and uncertainties still exist even in the wake of the Cold War,
and that hegemonism and power politics are still the main
obstacles to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The development of multi-polarization is conducive to peace,
stability, and development in the world, Li said. "One of the
fundamental goals of China's foreign policy is to create a
peaceful international environment," he added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Briefs Lebanese Leaders on Latest US Peace Efforts (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
Al-Shara said here today that he conveyed a message to Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi from Syrian President Hafez al-Assad which
deals with results of the latest peace efforts by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his talks with the Lebanese president, Shara said
he delivered the message to Hrawi in the presence of Lebanese
House Speaker Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and
Foregin Minister Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in the Beirut Presidential Palace,
the Syrian foreign minister said the message deals with the latest
developments in the peace process, and especially results of a
peace shuttle mission in the region by U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher and his talks with Syrian President al-Assad in
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
On a recent Israeli proposal that it would conditionally
withdraw its troops from south Lebanon without waiting for a
breakthrough with Syria, Shara pointed out that Lebanese officials
had "clearly" responded the Israeli suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said in the Israeli
self-styled security zone in south Lebanon Tuesday that Israel
"would not wait for the negotiations with Syria and would
withdraw" its troops only if the Beirut government made a "real
attempt to guarantee that there will be just one government, just
one army and peace and security."
</P>
<P>
Shara underlined that the two positions of Lebanon and Syria
are "one position," and an interlock between the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks is well-known for all including Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli Prime Minister Peres' statement has been clearly
responded by the Lebanese officials," said the Syrian foreign
minister, adding that, "we believe that Lebanon's response is
suitable and correct."

<P>
"Any attempt to derail the peace process from its road is
doomed for failure, and a comprehensive peace is the goal of
Lebanon and Syria which we will never give up and we will
continuously work for its success," Shara said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri and Foreign Minister Boueiz on
Wednesday described Peres' proposal on the conditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon as "a new maneuver and an attempt to
put forward an impossible condition in the negotiating process."
</P>
<P>
Hariri accused the Jewish state of "releasing test balloons" to
cause a confusion in Lebanon and to put a wedge between Lebanon
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that peace is a strategic choice for the Arabs,
reiterating a Lebanese demand of an implementation of
U.N. Security Council resolution 425, which calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from the Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
The syrian foreign minister underlined the "basical role"
played by the United States in the Middle East peace process,
saying that it is "natural" for the United States to pursue a
comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"It is natural that the United States concerns and desires the
realization of a comprehensive peace in the region," he said. "And
the comprehensiveness of peace without Syria is impossible."
</P>
<P>
Shara pointed out that in seeking a realization of its goals in
the region, a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East
based on relevant U.N. resolutions, Washington must promote good
relations with all the concerned countries and consolidate its
position as a "neutral mediator and active partner."
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the region on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher announced in Tel Aviv that Toni
Verstandig, assistant secretary of state, stayed behind in
Damascus to explore Syria's economic priorities, its hopes and
aspirations and also to gather information about its economy.

also increase cooperation in political and diplomatic fields.
</P>
<P>
Li said he felt happy that Sino-French relations have recovered
from the ups and downs of the past and are on a normal development
track.

Charles de Gaulle, with foresight and sagacity, opened the door to
China for western countries.
</P>
<P>
"China and France have many interests in common, and are able
to have extensive exchanges and cooperation between themselves and
in international affairs," Li emphasized.
</P>
<P>

the world, and that France attaches great importance to its
relations with China.

relations in all fields to a new development stage," he pointed
out, saying that Paris is willing to increase exchanges and seek
common ground with Beijing in international affairs, joining hands
to play a positive role.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China's economy has had sustained development
since the policy of reform and opening up was initiated in 1978,
and it is expected to keep this good trend up for the next 15
years.
</P>
<P>
"As the biggest developing country, China has enormous consumer
demand and needs for investment, providing excellent conditions
and opportunities for economic cooperation between China and

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cultural Exchanges Between Macao and  Mainland Help Ensure Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Cultural exchanges between Macao
and China's mainland have surged since early last year, and the
exchanges are expected to be expanded further as the year of 1999
approaches.
</P>
<P>
Mainland's artistic performances, exhibitions and academic
seminars in Macao all increased last year, compared with previous
years. Meanwhile, cultural and artistic troupes and organizations
from Macao made frequent visits to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of people coming from China's
mainland to Macao for the purpose of cultural activities and
exchanges topped 1,600, and the number of Macao cultural and
artistic people going to the mainland reached several hundred.
</P>
<P>
Since early last year, a series of large cultural activities
were conducted in Macao with the cooperation of mainland
performers. Most of those activities have been warmly received by
the local people.
</P>
<P>
The China Acrobatics and Circus Troupe, for instance, made a
stir in Macao during last Chinese Lunar New Year when it gave out
nine performances and attracted some 30,000 viewers.
</P>
<P>
Major events in Macao also include the performance of mainland
players. Those events include the celebrations of the 50th
anniversary of the ending of the Second World War and the War of
Resistance Against Japanese Invasion, the official opening of the
Macao International Airport, which was inaugurated last December.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Macao drama and play troupes staged many
performances in the mainland. Macao Artists' works were exhibited
in many mainland cities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a film was shot with joint efforts of both
sides. It was the first time that a film had been made with actors
and actresses from the mainland, Macao and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Experts here say that the cultural exchanges and cooperation
between the two sides have played a positive role in improving
mutual understanding, and helped ensure a smooth transition of
Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The exchanges will have bright future as the year of 1999
approaches," said an expert. China will resume its exercise of
sovereignty over Macao on December 20, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Seeks Peaceful Settlement of Chechen Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has ordered Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to come up with a
peace plan for the rebel republic of Chechnya in a move widely
seen as paving the way for his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has said he will announce whether he will run for a
second term of office on February 15. But he admitted to
reporters that if the war in Chechnya continues, he has no chance
of winning.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of the Security Council on Wednesday, the
president told Chernomyrdin, a strong supporter of a peaceful
solution to the Chechen war, to select "the most acceptable peace
plan" and submit it for consideration in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with a number of regional leaders in the
Kremlin, Yeltsin told reporters, "We have seven variants on how to
end the war in Chechnya and the Security Council created a group
on Wednesday headed by Viktor Chernomyrdin which will group all
the variants together or select one of them which would suit
everybody," the president said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that a rapid and complete withdrawal
of Russian troops could trigger clashes between Chechen
separatists and pro-Moscow forces.
</P>
<P>
"Withdraw the troops from the whole of Chechnya and a massacre
would begin. Keep them and I should not even aspire for
presidency. The people would not understand me. Therefore, it is
necessary to find such a compromise which would suit everyone and,
mostly, the people of Chechnya," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president, 65, has so far stopped short of a formal
announcement of his intention to run his second term of office in
June, but few doubt he plans to enter the race.
</P>
<P>
He has said he will announce his decision on February 15.
</P>
<P>
His position has been severely weakened by the war in Chechnya
and other mistakes in foreign and economic policies. The speedy
move toward a peaceful solution to the war is seen as paving the
way for his entry into the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, known as a strong supporter of a peaceful
solution in rebel Chechnya, was the man who peacefully settled the
hostage drama in the Russian city of Budennovsk last summer, when
a group of Chechen terrorists headed by Shamil Basayev took some
3,000 people hostage.

<HEADLINE> HK Stock Exchange, SFC in Dispute Over Corporate Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong has slammed the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) over
its newly published corporate plan, claiming that it confused the
markets as to the proper roles and functions of the exchange and
the SFC.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported today that the exchange expressed deep
concern yesterday that the SFC was losing sight of its proper and
primary role as a regulator.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very surprised that the SFC presents itself as the market
development initiator, with the exchanges and market
intermediaries as doers," Edgar Cheng, chairman of the exchange,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the role of the SFC should be as an overseer,
monitoring the exchanges and practitioners and ensuring that their
development was in the best public interest.
</P>
<P>
The SFC published its third corporate plan on Monday, which
aims at enhancing Hong Kong's competitive edge as a financial
center. A series of studies and surveys are to be conducted to
further this goal.
</P>
<P>
The SFC issued a statement last night, saying there was no
suggestion of the SFC initiating any market development, and all
the studies relate to the SFC's desire to find out what the
regulatory issues are.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said the exchange would collect views from the markets
and make a formal submission to the government and the SFC.
</P>
<P>
He added that this incident would not sour the relationship
between the SFC and the exchange.

</P>
<P>
Officials attribute the improvements to an improved legal
framework for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
A provincial regulation on the protection of the environment
was adopted and went into effect last year, and 534 environmental
cases were handled, 26 enterprises were closed for pollution, and
four ventures were penalized for illegally importing foreign
wastes.
</P>
<P>
A certification system for discharging waste has been
established in southeastern coastal areas of the province, with
3,300 enterprises having registered so far.
</P>
<P>
Yang Mingyi, director of the provincial environmental
protection bureau, said that Fujian will use legislative,
economic, and administrative measures to control the discharge
volume of major pollutants, and that no increase will be allowed
in the future, based on 1995's figure.

<HEADLINE> FIA to Expand World Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- FIA president Max Mosley
announced in Karlstad, Sweden on Thursday a major expansion of the
World Rally Championship.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the eve of the Swedish
Rally, opening round of the 1996 world championship, Mosley
said: "In 1997, we will have 14 events. That will be increased to
16, as we have in Formula One. We've got to get it out of the
little club level."
</P>
<P>
Mosley said that extra rallies would raise the world
championship's profile and dismissed suggestions that it would
impose too severe a burden on top drivers.
</P>
<P>
"Most of us spend half the year or a little more in the
office, which is the equivalent. If you cut the number of
rallies, they'd just increase the amount of time testing," Mosley
said.
</P>
<P>
"Left to their own devices, they'd spend three weeks doing a
reconnaissance, which is why you didn't have more than 10
rallies. I think it's going to work very well."
</P>
<P>
Top drivers declined to make comments, but fear their future
workload will be too great.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore International
Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) of
the United States announced today that they had reached an
agreement to expand their landmark mutual offset system (MOS).
</P>
<P>
The exchanges said that on March 6, the CME will add the
successful SIMEX Euroyen futures to the CME's menu of interest
rate products, building on the history-making system that has
enabled the two exchanges to mutually trade and offset the
Eurodollar futures contract for the past 12 years.
</P>
<P>
The CME and SIMEX established the world's first MOS in 1984,
enabling traders to take positions on one exchange and offset them
on the other.
</P>
<P>
Today's launch, the SIMEX said, will mark for the first time
the world's most active non-US interest rate futures contract is
traded in the US and European time zones. Currently, the Euroyen
trades only during Asia Pacific trading hours.
</P>
<P>
"We are excited about the expanding on the world's most
successful exchange linkage, which helped make our Eurodollar
contract the most actively traded futures contract in history,"
Jack Sandner, CME Chairman said.
</P>
<P>
"Traders worldwide will now have immediate access virtually 24
hours a day to a Euroyen contract that is already well established
and liquid on the SIMEX," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Adding Euroyen to the mutual offset system will provide the
world's financial community with a cost-efficient, global risk
management tool that has withstood the test of time," SIMEX
Chairman Elizabeth Sam commented.

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, February 8 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build an advanced
light source that is at least 100 million times brighter than X-ray
light.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new synchrotron light source is to be built in
China's largest industrial city, Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The facility is expected to cost at least 100 million US
dollars and the Shanghai municipal government has agreed to put up
nearly half of the estimated cost, according to the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
"The proposed new machine will operate at energy levels of from
2.2 to 2.5 GeV to provide a brighter source of synchrotron light
for researchers in fields ranging from advanced materials, life
sciences, nuclear physics, medical science to electronics, medicine,
petroleum and the chemical industries," researchers from CAS said.
</P>
<P>
China already operates two synchrotrons: a first-generation
machine that acts as an ancillary facility to the Beijing
Positron-electron Collider, and an 800-MeV, second-generation
accelerator at the University of Science and Technology of China
in Hefei, Anhui province.
</P>
<P>
A recently published article in the leading international
scientific magazine "Science" describes the Shanghai machine as "a
broader plan to give Chinese scientists greater access to
synchrotron radiation to conduct both basic and applied research
across a range of fields." enditem

<HEADLINE> Private Groups Form Poll Watchdogs in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- As the date for the 1997
general elections draws nearer in Indonesia, several private
groups have formed their own election monitoring committees with
the proclaimed objective of ensuring fair polls.
</P>
<P>
The government has said it does not have the authority to
prevent private organizations from establishing their own
independent election watchdogs, as the constitution guarantees
that people are free to form their own election monitoring
committees.
</P>
<P>
However, H.S.A. Jusacc, the spokesman for the Minister of Home
Affairs, was quoted by Antara news agency as saying on Wednesday
that "We cannot stop those who want to form these committees, but
I think if the official Election Inspection Committee, which has
already been set up, is already doing an effective and efficient
job, there is no need for any other institutions."
</P>
<P>
Jusacc also noted that certain rules must be followed in
forming those election monitoring committees.
</P>
<P>
Politicians from the two minority parties, the United
Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI),
welcomed the initiative of forming other independent election
watchdogs.
</P>
<P>
The two parties complained of rampant cheating during the last
five elections.
</P>
<P>
But Golkar, the ruling functioning group, which won all five
elections with a huge majority, opposes the idea.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Home Affairs Yogie S.M. heads the National Election
Committee, which also includes a cross-party board that will
monitor the way the election is conducted.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, only three political parties, namely the ruling
Golkar, the PPP and the PDI, are allowed to take part in the
general elections which are held every five years.

ISLAMABAD, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Sensitive Price
Indicator (SPI) for the week ending February 4 showed an increase
of 0.06 percent over the previous week, said the Federal Bureau of
Statistics today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Statistics Bureau, the SPI for the last week
stood at 362.93 against 362.72 for the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The upward movement is mainly due to rise in the prices of
sugar, bananas and garlic.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Bureau compiled these figures after analyzing 46
essential items in 12 major urban centers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the price index of 19 kitchen items consisting of
flour, pulses, rice, mutton, beef, edible oils, potatoes,
tomatoes, red chillies and garlic, etc. for last week showed an
increase of 0.07 percent over the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Decision to Raise Rice Price in Favor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government's
decision on a 12.5 percent increase for the floor price of
unhusked rice received wide-ranging favor in the public, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the rise will improve the terms of trade
for farmers as long as prices of other commodities do not follow
suit, some food analysts believed.
</P>
<P>
The price increase was "quite high" and exceeds last year's
inflation rate of 8.46 percent and would boost farmers' real
income by about three percent.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information Harmoko announced that the government
increased the floor price of unhusked rice from 400 rupiah (17 US
cents) to 450 rupiah (19 US cents) per kilogram as of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 50 rupiah (2 US cents) rise is the highest since the
government implemented the floor price system for rice in 1969.
The increase is designed to help farmers benefit from the new
price and to match the country's inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
According to observers, farmers are often in a cornered side as
the government always maintains the price of rice flat while
letting prices of other goods continue to increase.
</P>
<P>
Changes in the floor prices of rice are usually announced by
the government in October and go into effect in January next year
when the planting season begins.
</P>
<P>
The prices of other goods generally start escalating shortly
after the government announces the increase of the floor price of
rice.
</P>
<P>
However, the National Logistics Agency (Bulog) considered it
too early to predict the impact of the new floor price on price
stabilization efforts by the Bulog which is responsible for
controlling the distribution of several sensitive commodities
including rice, soybean and flour.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, the Bulog has imported rice to
guarantee adequate stocks for market operations and routine
distributions for civil servants and members of the armed forces,
because farmers have been reluctant to sell their rice to the
agency, whichs set the buying price under the market, the analysts
said.

CAIRO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will form a committee
headed by Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri to probe ways of
reviving the country's film industry, the Middle East News Agency
(MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Mohamed Fareed Khamees, Chairman of the
Federation of Egyptian Industries, as saying that the move was
approved at a meeting between Ganzouri and businessmen Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
The committee will discuss reducing the taxes and customs
duties imposed on the film industry, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was once dubbed "Hollywood of the Middle East" when it
exported more than 200 films annually. Egyptian films contributed
greatly to making the Egyptian dialect the most widely understood
in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
However, the film industry in Egypt has degenerated over the
past years. Egypt now exports only about 15 films each year.
</P>
<P>
Many art critics have blamed fundamentalism for the crisis of
the Egyptian film industry.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Both Pakistan and Iran are
working for restoring durable peace in the war-torn Afghanistan, a
senior Pakistani official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen at the Foreign Office, Pakistani Foreign
Office Secretary Najmuddin Sheikh said he had fully exchanged
views with visiting Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Allauddin
Broujerdi on the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Broujerdi arrived here today after meeting Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani in Kabul and some other Afghan factional
leaders in the Afghan eastern city of Jalalabad.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh said both Pakistan and Iran agreed on such a peace
process in which a broadbased government should be set up in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Both Pakistan and Iran wanted all the Afghan groups to have
representation in the future government, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Sheikh quoted Broujerdi as saying that some factors in
the process needed to be thought about thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
The process might move slowly, Sheikh said, adding, "but we are
moving in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
"Now, we are waiting for the Afghan groups to put forward their
concrete proposals for the composition of the future government,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that Pakistan and Iran, the two important
neighbors of Afghanistan, have different views on how to realize
peace in the war-ravaged Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Sheikh said Iran still maintained that
whoever control the Afghan central government, Iran would deal
with them.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan does not recognize the legitimacy of Rabbani whose
term of office expired at the end of 1994 according to several
agreements reached by Afghan groups.
</P>
<P>
However, Sheikh did not say clearly if Pakistan's stand would
be changed.
</P>
<P>
Broujerdi is scheduled to leave Islamabad this evening.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the 18
member economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
have agreed on the procedures to be followed in the preparation of
the action plans for the final reports to APEC ministers in
November.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Trade and Industry Assistant Secretary Edsel
Custodio told a press briefing, "It is very important that as a
first step, we have been able to agree on this ... (because) there
should be common elements for better understanding of what we are
talking about."
</P>
<P>
The senior officials, who are here for the first of the four
meetings, also agreed to have the Committee on Trade and
Investment (CTI) come up with a common format and meetings for
reporting individual action plans.
</P>
<P>
So far, only Singapore and Hong Kong have submitted format
prototypes of their individual action plan. Both submissions
focused on areas of deregulation and non-tariff measures since
they are free ports.
</P>
<P>
Custodio said he thinks five economies may be ready to turn in
their individual action plans in May, eight more submissions
between July and September, and probably three in October.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the individual action plans, a collective and
multilateral action plan will be prepared by the APEC toward
implementing its vision of open trade and investments in the
Asia-Pacific region by the year 2010 for developed economies and
2020 for developing economies.
</P>
<P>
Results of the four senior officials meetings will form the
substance of the 1996 Manila Action Plan for APEC (Mapa '96) to be
drafted by APEC's foreign and economic ministers in November.
</P>
<P>
This will be the basis for the declaration to be issued by APEC
leaders after their meeting in Subic also in November.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan problem can be
solved through establishing a broadbased central government, a
senior Pakistani official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the Foreign Office this
afternoon, Pakistani Foreign Office Secretary Najmuddin Sheikh
said there appeared some progress towards the solution to the
lingering Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the durable peace requires to set up an
interim mechanism in Kabul, subsequently to establish a broadbased
central government," Sheikh said.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't see any signs that Afghan groups opposed the
suggested peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistan is not in a position to say anything about
the composition of the interim mechanism and the future
government, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Afghan people should make decisions themselves," he added.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Sheikh said many Afghan parties asked
the present Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani to step down
before setting up any kind of interim mechanism or government.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani's term of office expired at the end of 1994 according
to several agreements reached by Afghan rival groups.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Control Remains China's Macro-economic Control Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to take
control of inflation as its chief goal in its macro-economic
management and regulation this year, the State Planning Commission
(SPC) announced today.
</P>
<P>
Commission spokesman Bai Hejin said that problems facing the
country's efforts in easing inflation centered on money supply and
strong investment incentives.
</P>
<P>
"To guarantee a healthy economic development, China will adopt
appropriately tight monetary and fiscal policies not only this
year but for the whole Ninth Five Year Plan Period (1996-2000),"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Bai, who is also deputy secretary-general of the SPC, said that
to curb investment demand, China will mainly resort to controlling
the scale of fixed asset investments this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the country will continue to be strict in approving
fixed asset investment projects and will speed up the
establishment of mechanisms to highlight the responsibility of
investors against risks and losses.
</P>
<P>
"We will strive to lower the investment rate on fixed assets
from around 34 percent last year to 32 percent this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China will "spend more efforts in strengthening
agriculture," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although China reaped a bumper harvest this year, he added, the
per-capita grain occupation was not only just the same as the 1993
level but six km lower than that for 1990.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that another measure to be taken against
inflation is the strengthening of supervision over the markets.
</P>
<P>
"To provide a solid basis for nudging the country's inflation
rate below its economic growth rate, we shall try to decrease the
growth rate of the retail prices further from last year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China will endeavor to realize an overall balance of important
commodities, make an ample stock in state reserves, improve the
grain risk fund and by-food products prices regulation fund
systems to strengthen the country's power in market control."
</P>
<P>
China's retail prices index grew 14.8 percent over last year,
compared with 21.7 percent growth rate for 1994.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the other target for China's
macro-economic policies this year will be to sort out the basic
economic relations and form a new economic mechanism. That means
to change the mode of economic growth from quantity to quality.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, China will try to raise its economic
efficiency, invest more in the improvement of the technological
content of its industrial products and develop a modern means of
circulation.
</P>
<P>
"China will also try to score achievement in experimental
reforms by establishing modern corporate systems," he added.

HANOI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- An international optical fiber
cable network linking Thailand, Vietnam and Hong Kong (TVH) was
put into actual operation today.
</P>
<P>
The 3,400-kilometer-long TVH cable will provide a total of
15,000 channels, almost trebling the existing satellite channels,
and will be able to transmit more than 60,000 phone conversations
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Manh Hung, deputy director of Vietnam Telecom International
(VTI) said the system is able to meet communication demands and
help to reduce obstacles that occur through the operation of
satellites.
</P>
<P>
The high-quality system is also expected to help the
transmission of data, television and radio services throughout the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The TVH constitutes a new step in the development of Vietnam's
telecommunications on the world-wide information highway.
</P>
<P>
The part of the system in Vietnam began construction on March
30 last year and had been undergoing trial operation since January
1 by the VTI.
</P>
<P>
The cable, the biggest international telecommunications system
to have been installed in Vietnam, cost Vietnam 160 million
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Parties Oppose One-Person, One-Vote Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian political parties
believe that the one-person, one-vote election law should be
replaced by a new one based on proportional representation, an
opinion poll said.
</P>
<P>
The poll carried out by Al Urdun Al Jadid Research Center on 23
political parties in the Kingdom showed that those parties prefer
a completely different election law than the one-person, one-vote
law that was introduced in 1993, local daily Jordan Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the study also showed that 86 percent of
the parties want the voting age to be reduced from 19 to 18.
</P>
<P>
The poll revealed that 77 percent of the parties in the
Kingdom are against the allocation of a quota for women in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The quota specified for minorities in the current law should
be eliminated, half of the parties believed.
</P>
<P>
And 81 percent agreed to the formation of a special court to
look into cases filed by citizens contesting the results of the
elections, reported the study.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-nine percent of the parties want the number of the seats
in the Lower House be raised to 100 from 80.
</P>
<P>
Hani Hourani, director of the research center, was quoted as
saying that "there is a unanimous rejection to the current law."
</P>
<P>
However, the study did not give the margin of error.
</P>
<P>
A draft election law, which was prepared by former Prime
Minister Shrif Zeid Ben Shaker's government, included some of the
changes that political parties called for but was not officially
presented to the Lower House for discussion.
</P>
<P>
The draft law, which was based on the one-person, one-vote law,
has been shelved due to severe criticism from various political
parties.
</P>
<P>
In consultations with parliamentarians last week before the
announcement of the new government, new Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti stressed that a new election law would be introduced.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said the law will be based on the ideas and
aspirations of the Jordanian people and it will not be officially
presented before the conclusion of a nationwide debate on the
issue.

<HEADLINE> Enviromental Degradation Threatens Kenya's Main Lakes : Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- An offical from the Kenya
Marine and Fisheries Research Institute has warned that wanton
environmental destruction threathened the survival of the main
lakes of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
George Kinoti, the Chairman of the Kenya Marine and Fisheries
Research Institute's (KMFRI) management board, described Lake
Nakuru as "virtually dead' as a result of serious environmental
destruction.
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech to researchers and the KMFRI board members,
George Kinoti said that Kenya's other lakes like Victoria,
Baringo and Naivasha are also seriously affected by human
activities.
</P>
<P>
He said the degradation of Kenya's fresh water and marine
resources is part of the extensive destruction of the natural
resources now in progress throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Kinoti, who is also a university don, cited cutting down of
trees, soil erosion and pollution as the major factors for
enviromental destruction.
</P>
<P>
He said Kenya's lakes are mostly affected by the problems of
overfishing, pollution and introduction of exotic fish and weeds.
</P>
<P>
Lower levels of Lake Victoria shared by Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda, are "practically dead" with some important species of
fish having disappeared or become extinct over the last 20 to 30
years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Kinoti called on the three East african countries to cooperate
in restoring the fame of Lake Victoria as a "rich fishery".

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian-Israeli trade
agreement signed last October will take effect by mid-March this
year, according to the local daily Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Smadi, Secretary General of Ministry of Industry and
Trade was quoted as saying that the two countries are expected to
exchange the instruments of ratification of the trade agreement
in the coming few days to open the way for normal economic, trade
and transport operation between them.
</P>
<P>
The trade agreement is expected to be applied within one month
of the exchange of the ratification instruments.
</P>
<P>
Although the trade agreement was signed last October, trade
exchange between the two countries did not materialize last year
due to the postponement of the signing of the transport agreement
between them.
</P>
<P>
The trade agreement provides for the exchange of different
types of commodities included in three lists: the first offers a
100 percent exemption of customs duty, the second 50 percent and
the third 20 percent.

<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Three regional information
networks of labor markets in south China, east China and north
China have been linked up by computers with the Labor Market
Network Center at the Ministry of Labor, ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
The three regional networks were put into operation separately
at the end of January this year. The overall network covers 21
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, which make up 40
percent of the country's territory and involve 500 million
workers, said Wang Dongyan, director of the ministry's Information
Center.
</P>
<P>
The overall network will consist of networks at national,
regional, provincial and city levels, with each network focusing
on cities which have a large labor turnover.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of information networks on labor markets
will help transfer the information on labor supply and demand
accurately and timely, so as to provide correct guidance for labor
flows and reduce random flows," said Zhang Xiaojian, director of
the ministry's Employment Department.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta,
Beijing and Tianjin have become China's main economically-booming
areas, and have been attracting large numbers of workers from the
countryside, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, French Foreign Ministers Hold Talks (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking of the international relations, Qian said that China
is against the bi-polar confrontation during the cold war period
and the establishment of a new world order with one country as
leader in the post cold war period.
</P>
<P>
China stands for carrying out extensive exchanges and mutually
beneficial cooperation on an equal footing on the prerequisite of
acknowledging the diversity and multi-polarization of the world,
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks de Charette reaffirmed the French government's
"one China policy".
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the French government for its stand in
pursuing an independent foreign policy, Qian said, adding that
China and France shared views in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
Qian also expounded the significance of the forthcoming
Asian-European Meeting, saying that it signifies that the Asian
and European continents want to develop not only economic
relations and trade but also political relations, for they are
conducive to the balance and stability in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
China has taken a positive attitude toward the convening of the
meeting and is willing to join all participants to contribute to
the political contact and economic cooperation between the two
continents.
</P>
<P>
Sharing Qian's view, de Charette said, France hopes to see that
Europe plays its due role in international affairs. France and
China, both permanent members of the UN Security Council, should
strengthen cooperation and play their corresponding roles in
international affairs, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
de Charette said mutual understanding, trust and cooperation
between Asia and Europe is of particular significance.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Qian Qichen reiterated China's principle
stand on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
de Charette reaffirmed French government's "one China" policy,
saying his government would limit its relations with Taiwan within
economic and cultural exchanges. The French government would
strictly abide by the commitment it made in the joint communique
of the two governments issued on January 12, 1994, and in the
exchanged notes between the foreign ministers of the two
countries. This stand of France will not change, he stated.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
higher against major currencies today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar rose to 75.47 US cents from 75.25 US
cents on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was not affected by the employment figures
released today. But it was pushed higher by overseas factors.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government surprised international financial
market by announcing de-regulations measures for the banking
sector ahead of schedule today.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Ministry of Finance lifted the restriction on
banks to keep their offshore investment under 30 percent of their
equity. This means that Japanese banks can invest more in foreign
bonds and stocks.
</P>
<P>
The US dollar went up against the Japanese yen at 106.89 yen in
Sydney from 106.98 yen on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar rose against all major currencies on the
back of a firmer US dollar.
</P>
<P>
The major concern of the local financial market is whether
Japanese investors will put their money into Australia after the
de-regulation. If Japanese investors decide to buy Australian
bonds, they will need a large amount of the Australian currency.
Japanese buying will in turn push the Australian dollar higher.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 80.57 yen against the Japanese
yen from 79.61 yen on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was also firmer against the German mark, ending at 1.116
marks from 1.0095 marks yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls on Bulgaria to Ease Ethnic Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has called on the
Bulgarian government to ease the tensions regarding the ethnic
Turks in the country, the Turkish Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Turkey expressed its great concern after Kircaali Court took a
decision to annul the result of the municipality election in
Kircaali, a town mainly populated by ethnic Turks of Bulgaria,
where Rasim musa, the candidate of the pro-Turkish Movement for
Rights and Freedoms, won the elections. The court decision was
made late Monday, following a two-month long trial.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel said Wednesday
that the "anti-Turkish elements" had been dominant in the campaign
since the local elections.
</P>
<P>
Akbel expressed his hope that people who have been part of the
inhuman assimilation campaign in the past would not be permitted
to raise tensions again through anti-Turkish campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Turkey and Bulgaria worsened in the late
1980s, when ethnic Turks, forced to change their names under a
severe assimilation over the lack of economic opportunities, were
forced to turn back.
</P>
<P>
Later, bilateral relations between Turkey and Bulgaria and the
standard of living of the ethnic Turks improved. Last year's
elections, however, caused a new friction between the two
neighboring countries when Bulgaria accused Turkish diplomats of
interfering in the local elections in the country.

HARBIN, China, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan, making a
debut to the Asian Winter Games here, on Thursday jumped from
Wednesday's fourth place to top the medal tally after amassing
nine gold medals.
</P>
<P>
This central Asian country, which had placed third overall in
the last national games of the former Soviet Union, is expected to
stay in the top three which had been the domain for Japan, China
and South Korea in the previous two games.
</P>
<P>
It won't be too surprising if Kazakhstan, serious contender for
the remaining seven ski golds, perchs atop the games' final medal
tally.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, with one gold to its credit on Thursday, placed
second with eight golds while overnight leader China, with eight
golds yet less silvers than South Korea, was third.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan won four more events on Thursday, three from the
snow and one from the men's ice hockey.
</P>

Dmitri Pantov, bronze medalist in the men's 20-km biathlon
three days ago#,claimed the 10-km biathlon race in 30 minutes
59.04 seconds.

<P>
Pantov, who had finished third at the 1994 World Cup, beat his
countryman Valeri Ivanov, winner of the 20-km biathlon, by 4.2
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's Inna Chechkil snatched the women's 7.5 kilometers
biathlon in 25 minutes 56.8 seconds, adding to her 15 kilometers
title, while her compatriot Olga Vediacheva registered a two-run
total of 1:44.71 to win the women's giant slalom event.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan clinched its third straight victory to lift the
men's ice hochey trophy after beating South Korea 9-1 on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Urged to Facilitate Further Improvement of Sino-US Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman today urged the United States to make joint efforts with
the Chinese side to facilitate the further improvement of Sino-US
ties by removing the disruptions and reducing troubles.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Shen Guofang, made the statement when he was
asked at a weekly press conference to comment on the recent
vice-ministerial consultations between China and the United States
and on the development of bilateral ties in the new year.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings in New York and Osaka last year, Shen said,
leaders of China and the United States reached extensive common
understanding on major issues in bilateral relations, which was
followed by the emergence of certain momentums of improvement of
such relations.
</P>
<P>
In the new year, he added, there are both the opportunity for
improvement and development and destablizing factors in the way of
Sino-US ties.
</P>
<P>
"The most urgent task at the moment is to translate the common
understanding of leaders of the two countries into tangible
actions of cooperation," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The question concerning Taiwan is always the most sensitive
and most important one in Sino-US relations and is also the key
issue to decide whether Sino-US relations can be kept stable this
year," Shen added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the US side will, drawing due lessons from (the
incident of) Lee Teng-hui's visit, abide by the principles set
forth in the three Sino-US joint communiques to the matter, and
work with the Chinese side to remove disruptions and reduce
troubles so as to facilitate the further improvement and
development of Sino-US relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told the press conference that Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister
Li Zhaoxing held the vice-ministerial political consultations
between China and the US with US undersecretary of state for
political affairs, Peter Tarnoff, in Washington recently.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on Sino-US relations and international
issues of common concern, Shen said, adding that this round of
consultations was "frank and useful."

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Athletes Lack Funds Before Atlanta Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan athletes have lost
financial support form their government before the Atlanta Olympic
Games and the its best long-distance runners have threaten to pull
out of the world cross-country championships.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no government funding for any national teams
before the Atlanta engagements," according to a statement issued
on Wednesday by the Kenya National Sports Council (KNSC), the main
government sports liaison agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The KNSC decision would mean the national teams relying on
government sponsorship would miss all events before the Athlanta
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
It even effected Kenya's participation in the world
cross-country championships.
</P>
<P>
"If we are included in the KNSC directive we shall withdraw
from the world cross-country championships. We may also cancel
the national trials that lead to the championships," said Isaiah
Kiplagat, chairman of the Kenya Amateur athletics Association
(KAAA).
</P>
<P>
The world cross-country championships are to be held in Cape
Town on March 23. Kenya's national championships are planned for
Nairobi on February 17.
</P>
<P>
The KNSC has already asked three of the country's soccer
clubs, Gor Mahia, Rivatex and AFC Leopards, to seek their own
funds if they want to take part in the African clubs'
championships in which they have been entered.
</P>
<P>
With their funding problems, Kenya pulled out of staging the
continent's premier soccer event, this year's African Nations'
Cup, citing a shortage of funds that had been required to renovate
a stadium.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Refuses Israel's Proposal on Conditional Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has refused Israel's
recent proposal on a conditional withdrawal from Lebanon before
breakthrough in talks with Syria, describing the proposal a new
"maneuver" and reiterating the demand for an unconditional
Israeli withdrawal, local media reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres Tuesday visited Israel's
occupied zone in south Lebanon, saying he would withdraw troops
if the Beirut government made a "real attempt to guarantee that
there will be just one government, just one army and peace and
security."
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri accused Israel of
releasing "test balloons" to cause confusion in Lebanon and to put
a wedge between Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The peace is a strategic choice for the Arab," the prime
minister announced at an Al-Iftar (breakfast in the Islamic
fasting month of Ramadan) in his residence in honor of dozens of
Beirut families and senior officials.
</P>
<P>
"But Israel persists in maneuvers and releases test balloons
to cause the confusion in this country and to put a wedge between
us and between the Syrian brothers," Hariri underlined.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the Lebanese demand for implementation of
U.N. Security Council resolution 425, which calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, reaffirming
that Lebanon's army and security forces will be ready to take
responsibilities to guarantee the peace and security on the
border after an Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
He warned against "diplomatic or political games or maneuvers"
by "going out of the resolution 425 and attempting to envelop the
resolution with a collection of treacheries."
</P>
<P>
Hariri ruled out the possibility that his country accepts this
kind of ideas.
</P>
<P>
Expressing optimism on the prospect of the Middle East peace
process, he emphasized that Lebanon, along with its ally Syria,
upholds the just and comprehensive peace which will return the
rights and honor to the Arab.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz was quoted by
the state-run National News Agency as saying that Peres' remarks
were "a new maneuver and an attempt to explore an intentional
difference between Lebanon and Syria."
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that Israel is attempting to put forward an
impossible condition in the negotiating process," the foreign
minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Peres reiterated in the occupied
southern Lebanese town of Marjayoun Tuesday that his country does
not have any ambition to perpetuate the occupation.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that in Lebanon you have armed groups which
don't take orders from the central government, like Hezbollah,"
he said after meeting General Antoine Lahd, commander of Israel's
client militia the South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is an Iranian-backed
fundamentalist Shiite organization which, allegedly having 5,000
fighters in the south, spearheads a guerrilla warfare against the
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Peres added that a peace deal with Damascus should be followed
by talks with Beirut.

cover such infrastructural sectors as agriculture, education,
public hearth, transportation, communications and urban
construction.
</P>
<P>
The funds have greatly boosted the economic growth and social
development of Hebei, a provincial official said.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Development Project, backed by a World Bank
loan of 150 million US dollars and completed by the end of last
year, have enabled 53 counties to produce an additional crop
harvest worth more than 200 million US dollars each year, the
official cited.
</P>
<P>
The Tuberculosis Prevention Project, with a World Bank fund of
6.2 million US dollars, has cut the province's incidence of
tuberculosis by more than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Another hygiene project financed by the World Bank has enabled
Hebei to establish public health agencies at the township level
and to train medical personnel in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Hebei imported 2.29 million
program-controlled telephone lines with overseas loans between
1991 and 1995, about 70 percent of the total installed during that
period.
</P>
<P>
Overseas loans were also used to fund sewage disposal projects
in Hebei's largest cities of Shijiazhuang, Handan and
Baoding. They were also used for technical renovations in the
province's key sectors of steel, medicines, textiles and
chemicals.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Ready to Establish Greater Trade Links  With Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Yang di- Pertuan
Agong (king) Tuanku Ja'afar said today that the government would
encourage the country's private sector to explore the possibility
of establishing greater trade and economic links with its
Venezuelan counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the credentials of Venezuelan ambassador to Malaysia
Eduardo Morreo Bustamente here today, the Malaysian king said
Venezuela, with its population of 20.6 million and import volume
of about 11.6 billion US dollars in 1995, remained a potentially
attractive market for Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Tuanku Ja'afar said both countries could for example cooperate
in areas such as the petroleum industry, where Venezuela has
achieved a high standard of technological advancement, and in the
oil palm industry, where Malaysia had attained competence in
production and research.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, he said Malaysia welcomed the emphases the
Venezuelan government gave to the Asia Pacific region, adding
close economic ties should be developed between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Boost Service Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- the Chinese capital will speed
up the growth of the service sector over the next five years in a
bid to turn itself into an international metropolis.
</P>
<P>
An official of the municipal government said that the city's
service sector is projected to grow at an annual rate of 10.5
percent during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The sector's ratio to Beijing's gross domestic product (GDP) --
the value of goods and services produced -- is targeted to rise to
50 percent in 2000, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the municipal government has decided to
concentrate development of the sector on such expanding industries
as commerce, banking, insurance, tourism, transportation,
telecommunications, information services and real estate.
</P>
<P>
In the commercial sector, efforts will be made to build more
wholesale and retail markets, supermarkets and cut-price stores,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The city's annual retail sales are projected to rise to 200
billion yuan in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks will be encouraged to open branches or
representative offices in Beijing, he said, adding that
construction of a financial street and an insurance network will
be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that Beijing will receive at least 2.4 million
overseas tourists and earn 2.5 billion US dollars in 2000.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period Beijing's service sector grew at an
annual rate of 13.5 percent, higher than that of the farming
sector and manufacturing industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
The service sector contributed nearly 48 percent to Beijing's
GDP in 1995, up from 38 percent in 1990. It now employs 710,000
people.

<HEADLINE> Thai Finance Minister Prepared to Leave His Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The embattled Finance Minister
of Thailand, Surakiat Sathirathai, has said that he was prepared
to leave his post if the prime minister so decides.
</P>
<P>
Surakiat has been heavily criticized by the opposition after he
sacked Ekamol Khiriwat, secretary general of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and deputy governor of the Bank of Thailand,
from both positions, accusing him of leaking state financial
secret to his friends.
</P>
<P>
The opposition said Surakiat failed to present evidence to back
his charges against Ekamol.
</P>
<P>
Surakiat recently has also been attacked for his decision to
drop attempts to levy back-dated income tax from Agriculture
Minister Montri Pongpanich.
</P>
<P>
Montri had been accused of tax evasion by military leaders who
staged a coup in 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, Surakiat said he was also prepared to clarify all
charges against him by the opposition in parliament in March.
</P>
<P>
Surakiat, a dean of the law faculty at Chulalongkorn University
and legal adviser to Chart Thai party leader Banharn Silpa-Archa
before the general election of July last year, was considered
inexperienced for his ministerial post and had been a target ever
since he was nominated for the cabinet position.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The breeding of
insect-resistant cotton through genetic engineering, which was
developed by the Bio-Technology Research Center under the Chinese
Academy of Agricultural Sciences, passed assessment by experts on
Wednesday, according to today's "People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
After five years of experiments led by Guo Sandui, researchers
have for the first time in China transplanted an insect-killing
gene into two major varieties of cotton in the Yangtze River and
Yellow River valleys and obtained five breeds of cotton that carry
the gene.
</P>
<P>
Experiments show that the cotton has a strong resistance to
insect infestation and this quality can also be passed to later
generations.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the technology meets the international
advanced standards in the same field.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Agrees Departure of Palestinians Fighters to Gaza, West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has agreed in principle
on a departure of hundreds of Palestinian fighters in Lebanon to
the Gaza Strip and West Bank to join the police of Yasser Arafat's
self-rule authority.
</P>
<P>
Today's Paris-based daily Al Hayat quoted Sultan Abu Al-Ainin,
head of the pro-Arafat Fatah Movement in Lebanon, as saying that
there is a Lebanese principled agreement on a transfer of a batch
of Palestinian fighters in Lebanese refugee camps to the self-rule
areas to join the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat announced last weekend that
Israel agreed on an entrance of 300 Palestinian fighters from
Lebanon to Gaza and West Bank to join the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that a list of 1,200 names, whom the Palestinian
Authority wants to transfer to the Palestinian self-ruled areas,
had been originally handed over to the Israeli administration for
approval.
</P>
<P>
Abu Al-Ainin told the daily that a Lebanese-Palestinian meeting
was held recently to work out the final arrangements preparing for
a departure of the Palestinian fighters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the transfer will be finished before the end of
this month.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks Told Not to Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Thailand, the central
bank of the country, wants to encourage Thai business people to
invest overseas, said Rerngchai Marakanond, deputy governor of the
bank.
</P>
<P>
Rerngchai said the Central Bank wants to encourage Thai
companies to invest abroad.
</P>
<P>
Capital outflow increased 56.6 percent from 1994 to 1995, with
total capital outflow reaching 758.6 million baht (30.34 million
US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Thai investors have invested most heavily in Europe, the United
States, China and other members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Vietnam and Brunei.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic front, he said the Bank of Thailand does not
want local interest rates to become volatile, warning that
commercial banks not to lower interest rates before the Chinese
new year since demand for funds will increase during that period.
</P>
<P>
If commercial banks do decide to lower their interest rates
right now, they will have to raise them again before the Chinese
new year when demand for funds will surge, Rerngchai said.
</P>
<P>
He said commercial banks should not overreact to foreign
capital inflow since the situation in global money markets is
constantly changing.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand is satisfied with the Interbank Rate of
5-7 percent. The Central Bank considers a figure of 3-4 percent
to be too low and will keep interest rates below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
As large foreign inflow has resulted in high liquidity in the
money market, the Bank of Thailand has been continuously absorbing
that liquidity by issuing government bonds.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has also dictated that a capital reserve fund
for non-resident baht accounts be set at seven percent in its
effort to control capital inflow.

Local officials want the growth of the non-state economic
sector to exceed the State sector by the end of the century,
according to the new Five-Year plan (1996-2000) released by the
province.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, all departments involved have pledged to
give assistance and help to individually-owned and the private
businesses. They want to ensure that the enterprises will be able
to overcome difficulties in development processes.
</P>
<P>
The relatively less-developed non-state sector in Yunnan is
considered as one of the reasons hindering the economic growth of
the province when compared with booming coastal regions of
China. Inferior transportation and telecommunication facilities
are also singled out as reasons, say provincial officials.
</P>
<P>
Government policies set in the previous Five-Year plan period
(1991-1995) have already pushed forward the development of the
non-state sector.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, there were 630,000 individually-owned
industrial and commercial firms employing over one million people
and 4,563 private enterprises with over 93,000 people on their
payrolls. The sector paid 2.712 billion yuan (326.7 million US
dollars) of taxes in 1995.

<HEADLINE> "Image Project" Promotes Police-People Ties (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the beginning of this year drivers and pedestrians, whether
on Beijing's Chang'an Avenue or busy crossings in south China's
Shenzhen City, were deeply impressed by traffic policemen who used
standard gestures to direct traffic, changing their previous
sluggish appearance.
</P>
<P>
Unlike some policemen who used to shout at traffic regulation
violators, they always gave salutes and spoke politely while
fining or advising them. Many of them also prepared traffic maps,
bicycle pumps, first-aid kits and other things for drivers,
cyclists and pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
This change was brought about by a decision issued by the
Ministry of Public Security, asking traffic police in 36 big
cities, such as Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou, to "provide warm
service while strictly performing duties".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 174 cities have put police patrols on the streets to
guarantee safety in public places and assist those who need help
at all times and all places.
</P>
<P>
Some cities, such as Zibo, also have some 24-hour police posts.
</P>
<P>
"We've done lots of work in the past five years to improve
police-people relationships," said Minister of Public Security Tao
Siju.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts have proved fruitful," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's top legislature, the National People's Congress, passed
the Law on the People's Police last year, in which the obligation
of the police to serve the people was particularly stressed.
</P>
<P>
China has about one million policemen involved in cracking down
on crime or performing duties such as household registration,
traffic control, entry and exit security, fire-fighting and
computer virus tracking and killing.

<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Born only three months ago, Li
Jingjing is too young to understand the real meaning of her name.
</P>
<P>
But Li Mingyin and Tian Qinglan, living in Zibo City in east
China's Shandong Province, will tell their daughter later that her
given name means "gratitude to the police" in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"I feel grateful to the police because they saved our family,"
said Li, who was helped by two patrolmen when he had to send his
expectant wife to hospital at midnight. The policemen did not
leave the hospital until the infant had been born safely.
</P>
<P>
"Now I have come to believe that one really must turn to the
police for help whenever one is in difficulty," Li said.
</P>
<P>
But things were quite different only a few years ago. Surly
expressions, harsh words and a sluggish working style of some
policemen aroused many complaints from the public.
</P>
<P>
The change started when the local authorities started the
"Image Project" last year in an attempt to improve the work of the
police and their relationship with the local residents.
</P>
<P>
The more than 3,500 policemen in this city of three million
people were banned from saying rude words and abusing rights. They
also tried to improve work efficiency and to maintain closer ties
with local people in order to give them convenience and helps as
much as possible.
</P>
<P>
"More and more people have found that policemen are becoming
more reliable and helpful since we improved our work," said Wang
Zhenhua, director of the Zibo Public Security Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Zibo people's experiences have been shared by people around
the country.

<HEADLINE> China to Formulate, Revise IPR Protection Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials revealed here
today that a package of laws involving intellectual property
rights (IPR) protection are to be formulated or amended.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on China's IPR law enforcement,
Jia Mingru, director of the State Legislation Bureau, said the
regulations to be formulated include those on film markets,
protection of new plant species and integrated circuits.
</P>
<P>
Liu Peizhi, deputy bureau chief of the country's trademark
monitoring body, said the Trademark Law is expected to be amended
to include an article on the protection of well-known foreign and
domestic trademarks.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhengwu, secretary-general of China's Patent Office, said
the office has been authorized to enter two international
agreements related to intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
The agreements are the Strasbourg International Agreement on
Patent Classification and the Locarno Agreement on the
Establishment of Industrial Design Models.
</P>
<P>
The Patent Office is planning to help draft regulations which
will provide the patent offices at various levels with the right
to investigate, seize and hold, or freeze the distribution of
pirated goods.
</P>
<P>
A package of regulations has been drawn up in the past few
years on IPR protection, and an inter-governmental body has been
set up to supervise the clamping down on IPR violations.
</P>
<P>
Duan Ruichun, director of the State Council's Working
Conference on Intellectual Property Rights, told the press
conference that China drew up an "action plan for effective
protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights" last
February in a bid to fight against such infringements of
intellectual property rights as copyright piracy, patent
infringement, trademark counterfeiting and unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the working conference show that no less
than 800,000 pirated records and video-tapes have been seized and
destroyed as well as over 20 million pirated LDs, over 40,000 sets
of software and 480,000 copies of pirated publications.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on IPR infringement and copyright piracy has
become a routine task of the localities and related departments,
Duan said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese government launched a "winter
offensive" at the end of last year to crack down on illegal
publications, including copyright piracy.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will extend
loans of 10 million US dollars for technical renovations in six
non-governmental Chinese enterprises, according to an agreement
signed here earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The loans, to be re-lent by China's Bank of Communications --
the country's first and largest national joint-stock commercial
bank -- are the first provided for China's non-governmental sector
by the international financial body.
</P>
<P>
The non-governmental sector is one of the most dynamic element
of the fast-growing Chinese economy and is badly in need of funds.
</P>
<P>
"Though small in total amount, the bank's first loans to this
sector will have far-reaching significance," Jiang Peilu,
vice-chairman of All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce,
said at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Daud Ahmad, an official at the World Bank's resident mission in
China, said that the international financial organization supports
China's efforts to commercialize its economy, noting that
commercialization is not privatization.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad promised that the World Bank will support China's efforts
to commercialize agricultural enterprises in the areas of breeding
seeds and manufacturing animal fodder, to restructure industrial
enterprises in Chongqing and Wuhan cities, to develop containers,
as well as to accelerate the commercialization of the state-owned
People's Construction Bank of China.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Drops Sharply in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
narrowed dramatically in November 1995 to 7.06 billion dollars,
the smallest in nearly two years, according to the Commerce
Department today.
</P>
<P>
The Department said the trade deficit in goods and services
dropped a sharp 13.6 percent to 7.06 billion dollars from a
revised October figure of 8.16 billion dollars. It was the
smallest imbalance since a 6.5-billion-dollar deficit recorded in
March 1994.
</P>
<P>
The monthly improvement reflected a big jump in exports of
capital goods such as aircraft and computer parts to a record
level of 20.8 billion dollars. Sales of military goods, including
Patriot missiles to Saudi Arabia and helicopters to Greece, also
showed a remarkable increase.
</P>
<P>
For November, the trade deficit with Japan dropped to 4.13
billion dollars, the lowest level since May 1993.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Canada, America's biggest trading partner,
narrowed to 1.8 billion dollars in November, but the imbalance
with Mexico, the other member in the North America Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), surged to 1.67 billion dollars, the highest
figure since last March.
</P>
<P>
The narrowing trade deficit in November reflected a 0.9 percent
increase in exports of goods and services, which rose to 67.36
billion dollars, and a 0.7 percent drop in imports, which dropped
to 74.41 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in the overall deficit came despite the fact
that spending on oil imports jumped 7.5 percent to 4.59 billion
dollars. The average price per barrel of crude oil went down to
15.13 dollars in November.
</P>
<P>
The monthly trade deficit peaked in June last year at a record
11.39 billion dollars and since then has been showing a gradual
improvement.
</P>
<P>
However, even with the November improvement, the deficit for
the year is on track for an all-time record with the imbalance in
merchandise trade alone expected to reach some 162 billion
dollars, surpassing the old record of 152.1 billion dollars set in
1987.

COLOMBO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Morimura Brothers of Japan
has invested 5 million US dollars in a joint venture with Aristons
of Sri Lanka for the manufacture of Silica Quartz, official
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly Sri Lanka becomes the first among developing
countries and the fourth in the world to produce fused quartz.
</P>
<P>
Production is scheduled to commence in the middle of this year
and around 200 persons are expected to be employed.
</P>
<P>
The project which will use high technology envisages the
construction of a plant to process silica quartz primarily for
export.
</P>
<P>
In the first stage silica quartz will be crushed and processed
to grain size. Later it will be crushed further into a fine powder
and finally fused through a specialized heat treatment.
</P>
<P>
Free silica occurs in nature in many forms. In Sri Lanka it
occurs as vein quartz, silica sand and quartzite.
</P>
<P>
Morimura Brothers is a world famous company and are the holding
company of Noritake Ltd which has been producing internationally
famous crockery in Sri Lanka for the past 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Not Every LD Factory Produces Pirated Goods: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Some of China's laser disc
factories have been cleared by officials of producing pirated
goods.
</P>
<P>
 The all-clear follows foreign claims that every laser disc
production plant in the country had manufactured illicit discs.
</P>
<P>
Wang Huapeng, director of the State Copyright Administration's
Copyright Department, refuted the allegations that all of the 34
Chinese LD factories have been making pirated products.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks at a press conference today at the
Working Conference on Intellectual Property Rights under the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has no reason to close those factories
that are being run lawfully," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that some factories are still having their equipment
installed and have never had a chance to produce one disc.
</P>
<P>
Only a dozen factories have been identified as copyright
violators. But the piracy has been halted after government
crackdowns.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the government has revoked business licenses of
several factories in Guangdong and other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors have been sent to monitor production at a number of
factories, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another official told the press conference that a high-level
investigation had found no signs of piracy in those factories.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that there will be a continuing battle ahead to
totally eliminate LD piracy.
</P>
<P>
China produced 54 million LDs in 1995, according to the Press
and Publication Administration.

WELLINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jim Bolger expressed confidence today New Zealanders will opt for
continuity and security at the country's first MMP (Mixed Member
Proportional representation system) election later this year.
</P>
<P>
In his State of the Nation address delivered at the Auckland
Chamber of Commerce, he focused the speech on the economic gains
made after his National Party came to power in the past five years
and more.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out New Zealand is now in good shape, he said "we now
enter an era where the overall level of prosperity will continue
to rise and it's our duty to see that all have an opportunity to
share in it."
</P>
<P>
Bolger believed the gains can be secured under MMP, providing
the process is well managed.
</P>
<P>
He said his party can provide stability but needs support of
like- thinking parties.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the rival parties of the Labor and the Alliance,
he warned that a coalition of what he called left-leaning parties
will signal a rerun of failed policies.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister claimed the National offers a mix of sound
economics with decent social aims.

<HEADLINE> Development Program to Be Launched in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government will
launch a new development program based on the participation by
local people from next week, according to the Local Development
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the new program is to motivate local
people to be directly involved in development works and extend
government assistance to projects launched by the people, Minister
for Local Development Kamal Thapa said Wednesday at a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
Under the new program, various development projects aiming at
improving the living standard of rural people will be launched on
the basis of sharing the cost between government and people.
</P>
<P>
The government will share 70 percent of the cost of these
projects through grant assistance while the rural people should
deposit 30 percent of the cost.
</P>
<P>
meanwhile, the government will also provide grant assistance
for development projects in urban areas if local residents and
municipalities bear 40 and 30 percent of the cost respectively.
</P>
<P>
investments would be made in rural areas for drinking water
projects, irrigation, small cottage industries and repair of rural
roads, while in urban areas infrastructure projects and programs
for increasing women's income would be launched, the Local
Development Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the new program would help increase
people's participation in development works and contribute to
sustainable development of the country.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Minister on Sino-British Trade Ties (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to China's customs statistics, the Sino-British trade
volume last year hit 4.76 billion US dollars-worth, a 13.8 percent
increase over 1994, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Britain is now China's third-largest trading partner in the
European Union (EU). However, it has been relatively "backward" in
promoting its trade links with China in recent years compared with
other Western European countries, especially Germany and Italy, Wu
noted, adding that the growth of Sino-British trade volume is both
lower than that of the average level of China-EU trade and lower
than the speed of China's foreign trade development.
</P>
<P>
China and Britain have signed 1,306 joint-venture offshore oil
projects, in which British investment is about 8.28 billion US
dollars, Wu said, noting that Britain has taken the lead in the EU
in terms of investment in China.
</P>
<P>
But Britain's investment in China still lags far behind compared
with the scale of its total overseas investment, Wu said, adding
that China welcomes more British entrepreneurs to invest in China
and share the increasingly-improving investment environment in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986 the British government has provided China with three
batches of government loans totalling 755 million pounds sterling,
Wu noted, adding that the two sides will sign an agreement on the
fourth batch of British government loans to China amounting to 100
million pounds sterling, which will not only benefit China's
economic construction but also help enhance the competitive
ability of British products in the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
She also mentioned that her entourage will include some Chinese
entrepreneurs who hope to sign important trade contracts with
their British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that China's sustained and rapid
economic growth and its huge market potential provide good
opportunities for Sino-British economic co-operation, while the
two complementary economies also offer the necessary conditions
for such collaboration.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic about the prospects for Sino-British economic
co-operation", Wu concluded.

<P>
DHAKA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The stage was set to put the
South Asian Development Fund (SADF) into operation, according to a
source here today.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Bangladesh, represented by its state-run
Investment Corporation (ICB) Manager Director Khairul Huda, has
been selected as the first chairman of the governing board of the
fund for a 2-year term.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the governing board to mark the operation
of the fund is likely to be held either at the end of April or in
the middle of May in Dhaka, the source said, adding that the ICB,
now offering secretariat services to the SADF, is working to
finalize the date in consultation with the secretariat of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and its
members.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the SADF proposed by Bhutan was approved
in principle by the SAARC Council of Ministers in its meeting held
in New Delhi on April 30, 1995.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Minister on Sino-British Trade Ties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese trade official
has expressed the hope that China and Britain will strengthen
collaboration in the areas of energy, environmental protection,
electronics, chemical industry, aviation, automobile parts and
finance.
</P>
<P>
The statement came in an interview with Xinhua by Minister Wu
Yi of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation
(MOFTEC), who is expected to pay a five-day visit to Britain next
week as a guest of British Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry Ian lang.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that her British visit is aimed at exploring fresh
ways of expanding bilateral economic and trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-British economic and trade committee will be set up for
the two governments to conduct regular consultations, Wu said. She
revealed that the first meeting of the committee will be held
during her visit, which indicates bilateral economic and trade
relations have entered a new phase of stable development.
</P>
<P>
Sino-British relations underwent a difficult period from late
1992, when Britain adopted a confrontation policy on the issue of
Hong Kong, Wu said, noting that the loss in bilateral trade has
been kept to the minimum in the past three years owing to the
repeated stress by the Chinese side that it would not discriminate
against British enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Wu emphasized that a good political relationship between
countries can create a favorable atmosphere and conditions for
bilateral economic and trade co-operation.
</P>
<P>
She went on to say that new impetus has been put into bilateral
economic and trade ties since last year, with the increase of
exchanges of high-level visits, which indicates the improvement of
Sino-British political relations.
</P>
<P>
Wu said she believed that the good momentum in Sino-British
economic relations will be maintained so long as the two sides
make joint efforts.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Makes Tax Changes to Become Financial Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has approved a number
of changes in tax levy to become a key financial hub in the
region.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Wednesday of major government institutions chaired
by Finance Minister Surakiat Sathirathai, it was agreed that tax
on profit remittance of out-out loans of offshore banking services
should be waived to encourage foreign financiers to undertake
out-out transactions in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate growth of offshore lending, financial institutions
could lump their revenue from branches together for tax purposes.
This measure will shield them from shouldering too high a tax
burden.
</P>
<P>
Tax on foreign financial instruments issued in Thailand should
be cut to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taxation on offshore financial services will be adjusted. Both
local and foreign banks will compete against each other on an
equal footing. Currently local banks have the upper hand because
they can deduct 30 percent of corporate income before appraising
tax, while foreign banks could deduct only 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taxation on the over-the-counter market will be simplified. Tax
can be paid at the end of the year rather than in the form of
withholding tax.
</P>
<P>
Taxes on short term loans taken by financial institutions from
each other to ease liquidity will be revised, and taxation on
financial instruments will also be simplified. The Finance
Ministry will cut redundancy on marking coupons that have been
taxed.
</P>
<P>
Duty stamps on over-the-counter market trading would also be
waived.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand to Curb Overspending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Household debts in Thailand are
increasing as people spend more money on luxury goods such as cars
and other imported consumer items.
</P>
<P>
The growing amount of household debts signals that household
savings are declining, widening the gap between savings and
investment.
</P>
<P>
If spending is not slowed down, inflation and current account
deficit would be aggravated, according to Nimit Nontapunthawat,
executive vice president of the Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is now working out measures to discourage
people from spending extravagantly in order to bring down
inflation growth from about 5.8 percent last year to 5 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
Household debts are now snowballing. Households have to pay
interest to commercial banks of over 52 billion baht (2.08 billion
US dollars) and payment is expected to further grow.
</P>
<P>
Household savings have been halved from 15 percent of gross
domestic product in 1980 to only 7.8 percent now.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand recently raised the minimum income of
credit card applications to 20,000 baht (800 dollars), limited the
payment period for car hire purchase to 48 months and raised the
minimum down payment to 25 percent of the value of the car.
</P>
<P>
These measures have not discouraged people from continuing
their spending spree.
</P>
<P>
The central bank would issue additional measures to discourage
household spending, according to Nimit.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's savings are about 34 percent of its gross domestic
product, which is considered high compared with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the bank fixed the loan-to-deposit ratio at 112
percent, which has proved to be the most effective action, leading
to a slow growth in lending.
</P>
<P>
If local commercial banks want to abide by the central bank's
ruling, they must achieve 21 percent growth in mobilizing savings.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that an increase of local savings is one of the
most important objectives to build up the country's economic
stability and to help cut the current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Charl Kengchon, chief researcher at the Thai Farmers Research
Center, said an effective way to boost local savings is to develop
a provident fund.
</P>
<P>
The government could also entice local savings by implementing
a surplus budget.
</P>
<P>
To encourage savings, interest rates may not recede further
this year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls on Colleges to Open Wider to Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday called on college presidents to find innovative ways to
reduce costs and open college doors wider to students from poor
families.
</P>
<P>
"I would ask you all to think especially about those kids that
are coming out of homes in the bottom 20 percent, who are afraid
that they can't make it," Clinton told about 600 people at an
annual meeting of the National Association of Independent Colleges
and Universities.
</P>
<P>
Department of Education statistics show that almost 80 percent
of high school graduates from the top 20 percent income brackets
entered colleges in 1993, while only half of the high school
graduates from the bottom 20 percent income level were enrolled in
the same year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton advocated enlarging the college work-study program,
which provides part-time jobs and pays most of the salaries for
students, usually on campus.
</P>
<P>
The president expects to expand the program over the next five
years from 700,000 to over 1 million students.
</P>
<P>
In his State of Union address on January 23, Clinton proposed
1,000-U.S.-dollar merit scholarships for the top 5 percent of
graduates in every high school.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, China, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese speedskater
Yusuke Imai, who broke the Asian mark to win the men's 1,500
meters race on Wednesday, made it a double with an Asian record
time at the men's 1,000 meters at the Asian Winter Games on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Imai timed 1:14.27 to finish first, beating the Asian mark of
1:15.43 set by South Korean Bae Ki-Tae in 1992.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Kim Yoon-Man placed second in 1:14.32 and Vadim
Chakchabaev of Kazakhstan came third in 1:14.53 with Chinese Liu
Hongbo in fourth spot.
</P>
<P>
"What a surprise win," said the 18-year-old Imai. "Kim is the
top skater in the world and I am around number ten in Japan. I had
never imagined a gold medal, not mention an Asian record."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Imai led teammate Shinya Tanaka to a 1-2 finish
at the 1,500 meters.
</P>
<P>
Yusuke's winning time of 1:56.18 was 02.64 seconds faster than
the Asian record held by Japanese Toru Aoyange.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Chun Hee-Joo shattered the women's 1,000 meters
Asian record with a time of 1:23.30.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Chun, a sophomore majoring in journalism, beat
the four-year-old mark of 1:24.39 held by Japanese Kyoko Shimzaki.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Aki Tonoike and Chishiro Monda came in second and
third with a respective time of 1:23.42 and 1:23.44.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Xue Ruihong, the 500 meters gold medalist on
Wednesday, finished fourth at 1:23.58.
</P>
<P>
""The two Japanese are very strong over the 1,000 meters," Chun
said. "If they had not strained themselves on Wednesday, I could
hardly win over them."
</P>
<P>
Chun, the South Korean top skater at the 1,000 meters whose
personal best is 1:21.80, said she had tried to have a shot at a
1,500 meters medal on Wednesday but only finished a disappointing
fourth.
</P>
<P>
The 1,500 meters title went to Kazakhstan's Lioudmila
Prokacheva with Tonoike in second place.

<HEADLINE> EU Social Security Benefits Rose in 1989 to 1993 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Social security benefits on
average increased by 3.4 percent in European Union (EU) countries
between 1989 and 1993 and exceeded a quarter of their gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Expenditures on social security averaged a 26.6-percent share
of EU nations' GDPs in 1993, up 3.4 percent over 1989, according
to figures released today by the EU Statistics Agency (Eurostat).
</P>
<P>
Social welfare benefits in Denmark, the Netherlands, France,
Belgium and Germany were above the 26.6 percent average, while
those in Italy, Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal were below
that level.
</P>
<P>
EU countries boast enormous social welfare benefits, which
mainly cover pensions, health care, subsidies for the jobless,
child-raising, housing and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
Old-age insurance during the period under review made up 44.7
percent, or the largest share, of total social security benefits
in the EU, although decreasing by one percentage point compared to
the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
Italy spent 62.8 percent of its social security funds on
old-age insurance, the highest among the then-12 EU member
nations, while Ireland spent only 28.1 percent on the elderly, the
Eurostat said. Austria, Finland and Sweden joined the EU on
January 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
EU health care benefits accounted for 24.4 percent of the total
in 1993, a slight fall from 24.7 in 1989, followed by subsidies for
the unemployed at 8.4 percent, child-raising at 7.6 percent
and housing at 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment benefits went up by nearly two percentage points
in 1993 compared with the figure for 1989 due to the continued rise
in the jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
Among the then-12 EU members, only Portugal and France faced
social welfare deficits from 1989 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
Most EU countries including France and Belgium are now trying
to reduce their budget deficits by implementing austerity measures
in efforts to meet conditions for a single European currency zone
due to be set up in 1999. Central to their austerity drive is the
slashing of social welfare spending.
</P>
<P>
However, a planned overhaul of the social welfare system has
provoked widespread protests in France and Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Cotton Crop Estimated at 10 Million Bales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The final size of Pakistan's
cotton crop in 1995-96 was estimated at between 10.35 and 10.65
million bales, said local press here today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting of the standing committee on cotton crop
assessment held in Karachi in southern Pakistan, participants
expressed their satisfaction over the crop size which is 0.9 to
1.1 million bales above the target fixed by the government.
</P>
<P>
They said cotton crop should be large enough to provide about
30 to 35 percent surplus over and above the local mills'
requirement.
</P>
<P>
The All Pakistan Textile Mills Association has estimated the
total requirements of the local textile mills at 8.6 million
bales.
</P>
<P>
Exporters, who have commitments for about 1.9 million bales,
will buy another batch of 0.5 million bales to fulfill their
contracts since they have exported 1.5 million bales so far.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the season, it was estimated the size of cotton
crop would cross 11.5 million bales.
</P>
<P>
The figure was reduced due to a new variety of cotton sown this
year, which was less productive, and warm weather which also
reduced the production.
</P>
<P>
Cotton is the most important agriculture product in Pakistan,
which is a major exporter of cotton in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, due to leaf curl virus, cotton crops
were severely damaged in Pakistan, bringing serious effect on the
national economy.

<HEADLINE> Italian Lower Chamber Adopts Tougher Rape Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Chamber of Deputies today
approved a tougher bill on rape, but the proposed law, nearly 20
years in the making, has to be adopted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Deputies voted 239-39 with 15 abstentions to
approve the bill, proposed by Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's
government in May last year, who had vowed to combat increasing
rape crimes in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new law, if adopted in the Senate, will raise the minimum
sentence for a rape convict from three to five years, with the
maximum to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed law, rape, which used to be considered only
a moral offense, will be regarded as "a crime against person."
</P>
<P>
Italy began efforts to toughen the rape law in 1977, but the
bill had since been shelved due to squabbling between liberals and
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Most Italian parties hailed the bill's passage as one of the
important steps toward social reforms in the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sporting Companies Sued for Using Olympic Symbols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Five U.S. sporting goods
companies were charged with illegally bearing official Olympic
trademarks on their merchandise on sale, according to U.S. Olympic
officials in Atlanta on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, teams of special investigators have warned 33
sports apparel and sporting goods manufacturers to stop offering
"counterfeit" Olympic merchandise for sale in Las Vegas and
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The five companies were not identified in a joint statement
issued by the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) and
the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC).
</P>
<P>
The companies, which are facing a federal lawsuit, were
allegedly selling and distributing sports equipment, apparel and
other accessories bearing Olympic trademarks and copyrighted
designs.
</P>
<P>
The USOC and ACOG claimed in the statement they will seek
injunctions and monetary damages against the companies.
</P>
<P>
"Illegal use of Olympic trademarks and counterfeit activity
amounts to nothing more than stealing from our athletes and from
the American people. It's a serious problem that we are taking
serious action to stop," USOC deputy secretary-general John
Krimsky said in the statement.

RIO DE JANEIRO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Careless driving was to
blame for most of last year's 95,499 road accidents, traffic

<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- New measures will be taken to
protect wild animals in northeast China's Jilin Province, today's

staff will help enforce the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Management will be strengthened to stop the entry of
terrestrial wild animals and their products into the market.

</P>
<P>
The provincial decision also ruled that hotels, restaurants,
medicine manufacturers and any other organizations or individuals
should not buy, reproduce or sell non-artificially bred wild
animals and their products.

Without the three designated licenses, all breeding, deals or
transportation of animals will be considered illegal.
</P>
<P>
Heavy punishment will be imposed on those who harm terrestrial
wild animals resources during the moratorium.

PORT-AU-PRINCE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Rene Preval was sworn in
as the 54th president of Haiti today, succeeding Jean Bertrand
Aristide.
</P>
<P>
It was the first peaceful transfer of power between two
democratically elected presidents in a nation whose history has
been marked by military coups.
</P>
<P>
Preval was sworn in after Aristide placed the presidential sash
on him in front of the parliament buildings. The inaugural
ceremony will be held later in the National Palace.
</P>
<P>
Apart from consolidating his country's young democracy,
Preval's biggest challenges as president are poverty and
illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
He was the prime minister of Aristide's government before
winning the presidential election in December last year.
</P>
<P>
He went into exile with Aristide in the United States after the
coup that deposed Aristide in 1991. They returned to Haiti in 1994
after a U.S.-led multinational force returned Aristide to power.

<P>
A joint declaration, which opens a new stage in the contacts
between the two caribbean countries, was signed Tuesday night by
the foreign ministers of the two nations in the presence of
outgoing Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide, in
Port-au-Prince, capital of Haiti.
</P>
<P>
This was the last decision made by the Haitian government
headed by Aristide, who handed over his power to his successor
Rene Preval Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the signing ceremony, Aristide expressed satisfaction
with what he described as the most important decision of his
government.

<P>
According to the declaration, both countries have decided to
conduct negotiations over the arrangement of diplomatic and
consular representatives in Havana and Port-au-Prince,

<HEADLINE> Australian Unemployment Rate Rebounces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Australia's unemployment rate
bounced back to 8.6 percent in January after falling in December
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released today by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics, total employment fell by 24,200 to 8.3173 million in
January on an seasonally adjusted basis.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate jumped 0.5 percent in January from 8.1
percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed the volatile state in the Australian job
market, which saw the unemployment rate fell by a record 0.5
percent in December from 8.6 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
Today's figures proved twice as high as market expectations.
Local forecasters used to predict that employment would fall by
10,000 and the unemployment rate rise by 0.2 percent to 8.3
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The lower-than-expected employment figures damaged the rosy
picture paint by the Labor Government, which promised to cut the
unemployment rate to five percent by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks before the federal election, the volatility of the
job market will give the Labor party a harder time to persuade
voters of its ability to secure the employment goal.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a slack job market is expected to prompt the
Reserve Bank of Australia to cut interest rates. A lower interest
rates will benefit Australian households and be a election bonus
for the Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Paul Keating denied that today's figures were
indication of deterioration of the employment environment.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is that the unemployment is trending
down," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rise of unemployment in January was due to an
increase of the number of people joining the workforce.
</P>
<P>
But Opposition member Tim Fischer said that Labor had failed
the young Australians because the unemployment rate of young
people remained high.
</P>
<P>
In his first election policy launch last week, Keating promised
209 million Australian dollars (156.8 million US dollars) to cut
youth joblessness to five percent by 2000 from the present 21
percent.

PARIS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- France's population hit 58.3
million by the end of 1995, two million more than at the beginning
of 1990, according to a report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The population increased by 200,000 last year, France's

Life expectancy averaged 81.9 years for French women and 73.8
for men in 1995, nearly one year more than in 1990.

<P>
Women of child-bearing age have an average of 1.7 children,
slightly more than the 1.65 children they had in 1994.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Important Progress in IPR Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- China made important progress
in carrying out the "action plan for effective protection and
enforcement of intellectual property rights" in 1995 to
effectively crack down on the infringement of intellectual
property rights, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Duan Ruichun, director of the State Council's
Working Conference on Intellectual Property Rights, the
authorities of more than 20 provinces and cities as well as
intellectual property rights administration departments have drawn
up action plans in this respect.
</P>
<P>
"Law enforcement concerning intellectual property rights has
been markedly improved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Duan said that China drew up its "action plan for effective
protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights" last
February in a bid to fight against such infringements of
intellectual property rights as copyright piracy, patent
infringement, trademark counterfeiting and unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
According to the Working Conference on Intellectual Property
Rights, all the measures have been fully and effectively put into
practice. During the special enforcement periods in the first
eight months of last year over 4,200 inspections were carried out
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the working conference show that no less
than 800,000 pirated records and video-tapes have been seized and
destroyed as well as over 20 million pirated LDs, over 40,000 sets
of software and 480,000 copies of pirated publications.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, industrial and commercial departments at
various levels have handled more than 9,000 cases of trademark
infringement, involving fines of over 25 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on IPR infringement and copyright piracy has
become a routine task of the localities and related departments,
Duan said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese government launched a "winter
offensive" at the end of last year to crack down on illegal
publications, including copyright piracy.
</P>
<P>
A joint inspection group of the State Council inspected
Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hunan and Jiangxi provinces last
year, where major intellectual property rights infringements have
occurred. The group consisted of officials from the National
Copyright Administration, State Administration for Industry and
Commerce, the Patent Office, the police and customs departments,
and officials in charge of cultural undertakings, the press,
science and technology, and foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The Working Conference also briefed the press on China's
efforts to protect patents, trademarks, audio-video products and
computer software, and on the customs' copyright verification
system.

ROME, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Mark Foster of Britain

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Liberalize Motorcycle Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's long-protected
motorcycle industry, with a market value exceeding 50 billion baht
(2 billion US dollars) a year, will soon be liberalized by the
Thai government, according to the Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The freeing of the industry was seen as a move by the Thai
government to pursue world trade liberalization trends agreed on
by the World Trade Organization of which Thailand is a member.
</P>
<P>
Imports of both used and new motorcycles are controlled under
the 1979 import-export control act because the Thai government
wanted to protect local industries.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government believes the local industry has fully
matured and is ready for competition, Commerce Minister Chucheep
Harnsawat was quoted today by local newspaper Bangkok Post as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said liberalization will encourage local industries to
improve their products and import more technology to manufacture
quality products.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 1.45 million motorcycles were sold in Thailand,
compared with 1.2 million in 1994. The market this year is
forecast to expand to 1.5-1.6 million units.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 7 (Xinhua) -- All 189 people aboard a
Boeing 757 may have been killed after the plane crashed into the
sea off the Dominican Republic on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital, said that
Red Cross workers and the Dominican Civil Aviation Department had
recovered 59 bodies at the crash site up to noon today.
</P>
<P>
The chartered jetliner took off from Puerto Plata International
Airport at 22:43 local time (03:43 GMT) Tuesday, but plunged into
the ocean a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was bound for Frankfurt, Germany, with 13 crew
members (11 Turkish and two Dominican) and 176 passengers, most of
them German tourists.
</P>
<P>
Two members of the Polish parliament were on the passenger
list, Polish radio reported.

Luis Flores Mota, director of the Dominican Republic's Civil
Aviation Department, said that the control tower lost contact with
the Boeing 757 five minutes after takeoff.

Naval and air units from the United States, Puerto Rico and the
Dominican Republic are taking part in the search for survivors but
rescue efforts have been hampered by rain, high waves and sharks

<HEADLINE> Poland's Left-Wing Cabinet Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Poland's reshuffled left-wing
government, headed by Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, was sworn in today,
promising to continue the policies of economic growth and European
integration.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz, the new prime minister and the leader of the
ruling coalition comprising the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and
the smaller Polish Peasant Party (PSL), and his 20 ministers took
the oath of office before President Aleksander Kwasniewski.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz, 45, a member of SLD, said his government would
continue the economic, social and foreign policies of its
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
The new government will be "open for dialogue with different
political groups" and "will make sure that all Poles have a
greater feeling of security ... (and) a more justified hope for a
better tomorrow, for a better future," said Cimoszewicz.
</P>
<P>
President Kwasniewski also stressed the new government is a
proof of stability and consistency and a proof that "we can act
effectively." He hoped the government will last until 1997 when
parliamental elections are held.
</P>
<P>
Among the main changes from the former cabinet, Zbigniew
Siemiotkowski was appointed as new interior minister, Leszek
Kubicki as justice minister, Zdzislaw Podkanski as cultural
minister, and Andrzej Boczkowski as labor minister.
</P>
<P>
Former Vice Prime Minister Aleksander Luczak was also replaced
by Miroslaw Pietrewicz, the chief of the central planning office.
</P>
<P>
President Kwasniewski asked Cimoszewicz last week to form a new
government after Prime Minister Jozef Oleksy resigned amid
allegations that he passed secrets to Moscow for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
The Cimoszewicz cabinet, Poland's seventh since 1989, has two
weeks to win the approval of the parliament, where the coalition
partners enjoy a majority.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has decided that
lawyers in the city must timely defend clients in criminal cases
to help maintain stability and reverse the trend in which some
attorneys prefer cases involving civil and economic affairs
because the latter earn them bigger profits, "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcing the importance of the role of lawyers in political
and social life, Beijing Justice Bureau Director Zhang Xuming
yesterday declared that every attorney in the city should accept
criminal-defence cases assigned to them by the people's court.
</P>
<P>
"Each new lawyer during the first year of practising law must
handle at least five criminal cases," he told the close of the
three-day Beijing Judicial Administration Conference.
</P>
<P>
The newly appointed director affirmed that a legal aid clinic
will be established in Beijing this year to fully ensure citizens'
rights and interests by providing legal assistance to those who
cannot afford normal legal fees.
</P>
<P>
The director also called on Beijing's lawyers to enlarge their
practices beyond the standard areas of real estate, securities,
finance, and intellectual-property rights.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Zhang also disclosed that the city will
strengthen the work of resettling ex-criminals who have been newly
released from prisons to help avoid the temptation to commit new
crimes.
</P>
<P>
At present, Beijing has some 8,000 grass-roots organizations
with 30,000 employees working to resettle former criminals. Last
year, 88.9 percent of the city's former criminals were resettled,
and only 2.2 percent went on to be convicted of new crimes.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The 13-year-old French boy
Dimitri Flamme on Wednesday returned to his hometown Lille after a
15,000-kilometer cycling tour around the Sub-Indian continent.
</P>
<P>
In his hometown, the teenage was warmly welcomed by his
friends.
</P>
<P>
"I have grown up," he said. "I know a lot more about the
foreign countries."
</P>
<P>
Flamme started his biking tour with his sports teacher Philippe
Masselis on January 27, 1995. They cycled around India, Nepal,
Sri Lanka and Bangladesh during the one-year tour.
</P>
<P>
With 1,500 Francs (about 300 dollars) a month from Flamme's
father, they can only live in the homes of local residents instead
of hotels.
</P>
<P>
But they also won the support of the municipal government of
Lille and the Provincial Parliament.
</P>
<P>
This is Flamme's second cycling adventure since 1993, when he
toured 12,000 kilometers from North Ireland to Egypt at the age of
10 with Masselis.
</P>
<P>
They will make speeches on the Sub-Indian trip in schools,
libraries and children's clubs, then Flamme will go to the United
States to learn English.
</P>
<P>
Masselis will choose another partner aged between 10 and 13 to
continue his cycling tour across Australia and New Zealand.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and Yugoslavia today
signed a military cooperation accord involving the resumption of
arms dealings between them on a hopefully large scale.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Bulgarian Defense Minister Dimitr
Pavlov and his Yugoslav counterpart Paavle Bbulatovic early today.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral arms dealings had a good time before the war in
former Yugoslavia when the sales volume reached 540 million
U.S. dollars in 1989. The arms cooperation was ceased under an
U.N. embargo in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Prime Minister Zhan Videnov told the Yugoslav defense
chief that the military accord laid a good foundation for boosting
the bilateral economic cooperation as well.
</P>
<P>
Videnov said that both countries are interested in lowering
military antagonism, enhancing mutual understanding and
maintaining peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bbulatovic said his country needs Bulgaria's help
in economic, political and financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
Bbulatovic met with Bulgarian President Zheliu Zhelev on
Tuesday soon after his arrival for his first visit to the country
as defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Videnov is scheduled to visit Yugoslavia next week for further
discussions on bilateral cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The foreign trade of this,
China's largest metropolis has maintained an average annual growth
rate of 16.84 percent over the past five years, 2.8 percentage
points above that of the average local gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade has become the locomotive for the local economy,
Xu Kuangdi, the city's mayor, told a recent working conference on
the sector.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years the city's gross domestic product has
kept rising at an annual rate of 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade, consumption and investment are the three
propellants of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
With the foreign trade volume mounting up, the optimization of
export product mix has also brought incentives to local industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year the value of electronics and machinery exports stood
at 2.6 billion US dollars, up 37.5 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Technology export value also saw a 15 percent increase, with
1,452 transactions concluded.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade companies have lost their monopoly in export and
import, and about 1,000 industrial enterprises were given
self-managing rights of export.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in south
China reported a 12 percent increase in the number of its
overseas-funded enterprises in 1995 over the previous year,
sources at the provincial Bureau of Commerce and Industry said.
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the bureau show that the province now has
59,600 overseas-funded enterprises, with a total investment of
204.63 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone, the province registered 8,139 overseas-funded
enterprises, involving foreign investment worth 16.55 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The sources attributed the remarkable growth of overseas
investment to the improvement of the investment environment,
including the simplification of the complicated approval
procedures.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the authorities have improved the supervision
of foreign businesses. In 1995 the authorities canceled the
registration of some 960 overseas-funded enterprises and closed
down nearly 1,000 overseas businesses for breaking related laws
and regulations.

<P>
JAEN, Spain, February 7 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Defending champion Xie
Jun of China drew with Hungarian challenger Zsuzsa Polgar in the
sixth game of the women's chess world championship here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Xie, playing white pieces, initiated the game with her king and
Polgar answered with the Sicily defences.
</P>
<P>
Xie, who lost the fifth game on Tuesday, showed a consistent
play and tried to simplify the situation while Polgar also played
the game carefully.
</P>
<P>
The draw came when both sides had three pieces remained after
28 moves and neither could win the game after two hours and four
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Xie trailed the Hungarian 2.5-3.5 after the first six games.
</P>
<P>
This was the third draw of the first six, with Xie winning the
opener and Polgar taking the fourth and fifth ones.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Ye Jiangchuan said, "Xie is not in good form.
She can win the championship only after she manages to halt the
momentum of attacks from Polgar."
</P>
<P>
The draw in the sixth game meant a victory for Xie after two
consecutive defeats, Ye said, adding that Xie will make a comeback
to retain her crown.

<HEADLINE> Housing Prices Continue to Climb in Auckland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The booming housing market
in New Zealand's largest city Auckland has shown no sign of
slowing down, reported Television NZ today.
</P>
<P>
In the last six months of 1995 the average housing price in the
city rose to 291,000 NZ dollars (190,000 US dollars), nearly twice
the average housing price in New Zealand as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The new rise followed an increase in the previous two years,
when the city's average housing price climbed by one third.
</P>
<P>
The report said there is no sign of a slowdown this year, with
most Auckland real estate agents kept busy in January.
</P>
<P>
Economists see the housing market there as an overheated sector
of the economy. They blamed the high housing prices for pushing up
the country's consumer price index.

<HEADLINE> Ferry Runs Aground Outside Stockholm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A passenger ferry en route
from Stockholm to Helsinki ran aground in icy waters near Stockholm
on Wednesday but there was no danger to the 1,300 passengers on
board.
</P>
<P>
The passengers are likely to spend the night on the stranded
ferry, the Finnish-owned Silja Symphony, which was leaking at the
bow but appeared in no danger of sinking, rescue officials said.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear what caused the accident, which occurred at
around 7:20 p.m. (local time) off the island of Vaxholm in the
Stockholm archipelago.
</P>
<P>
A rescue official, Lennart Johansson, ruled out an immediate
evacuation, saying that they would recommend no evacuation be made
on the ground that "It is dangerous to take people over the ice in
the dark."
</P>
<P>
He said an attempt would probably be made to pump water out of
the front of the ferry in order to get it off the ground and then
return it to shore.
</P>
<P>
Divers were inspecting damage to the vessel, which carries 200
crew and ran aground only 50 to 60 metres from land.
</P>
<P>
Ferry safety has been a sensitive issue for Nordic nations
ever since the ferry Estonia sank in the Baltic in September
1994, with the loss of more than 800 passengers and crew.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Wine Exports Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's wine exports
continued to soar in volume and value despite the Government's
failure to remove the excise tax.
</P>
<P>
In the six months to December 31 last year, exports rose 30
percent in value to 30.8 million NZ dollars (20.33 million US
dollars), and 15 percent in volume to 5.2 million liters compared
with the corresponding period in 1994, Wine Institute chairman
John Buck was quoted by a local press report today as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rise reflects the large quantities of quality wine
available from the 1994 and 1995 vintages, Buck said.
"Particularly pleasing is the rise in average value of exports
from 5.25 dollars per liter to 5.93 dollars per liter at a time
when the New Zealand dollar is performing so strongly."
</P>
<P>
The wine industry aims to earn 100 million NZ dollars a year
from exports by 2000.
</P>
<P>
But Buck said the government has yet to resolve the issue of
its intervention through excise tax, which "continues to reduce
confidence of the industry, distort investment and deny wine
makers the opportunity to participate in the free-market economy."

<HEADLINE> Croatia Protests to Germany Over Mostar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Chief-of-staff of the Croatian
president Ivo Sanader today protested to German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel on the European Union's redrawing of Mostar's map, a
statement from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking by phone, "Mr Sanader said that the decision of the EU
Administrator of Mostar, Hans Koschnik, on the organization of the
city was in opposition to the Dayton Agreements and the agreement
Mr Koschnik reached with the Croatian side some 10 days ago," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Sanader asked Kinkel "to do all that is necessary so that the
decision mentioned above could be harmonized with the agreement
between Mr Koschnik and the Croatian side as well as with the
Dayton agreements."
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Kinkel called on the Croatian
government to exert its influence and ease the tensions in the
city.
</P>
<P>
A demonstration involving thousands of Croats occurred in
Mostar today following Koschnik's announcement of his arbitration
which would create three Croat municipalities, three Muslim
municipalities and one mixed central district.
</P>
<P>
The Croats rejected the map on the ground that the central
district does not fit with terms of the Dayton agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian president's chief-of-staff also spoke on phone
with Italian Foreign Minister and head of the EU Ministerial
Council Susana Agnelli, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Croats Protest EU Decision On Mostar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Several thousand Croats gathered
in Mostar Wednesday afternoon to protest against EU
administrator's decision on the new city structure, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Some protesters stormed into the Ero hotel and ransacked the EU
offices inside, while others turned over cars parking outside and
tramped the car for EU administrator Hans Koschnick.
</P>
<P>
The western (Croat-controlled) city Mayor Mijo Brajkovic, who
also joined the rally, announced that Croats rejected Koschnik's
arbitration which would establish 3 Croat districts, 3 Muslim
districts and one mixed central district.
</P>
<P>
Brajkovic said: "we consider the existence of a common district
contrary to the Dayton peace accords which foresaw only three
Croat and three Moslem districts".
</P>
<P>
However, commenting on Brajkovic's claim that the map is not in
accordance with the peace accords, Koschnick said that he has
"legal basis for this decision," and that he has support from the
EU and the U.S. state department.
</P>
<P>
Koschnick imposed the new map when negotiations between Croats
and Muslims failed to hammer out their agreement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Credit Up 9.3 Percent in Dec. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer credit
rose at a 9.3 percent annual rate in December, including a hefty
14.2 percent increase in credit card use during the holiday
shopping season.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve said in a report today that consumer
borrowing increased 7.9 billion U.S. dollars in the last month of
1995, compared with 9.8 billion dollars in November, which was an
annualized gain of 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said that the new borrowing boosted the total amount of
consumer instalment credit to 1.049 trillion dollars at the end of
1995, an increase of 13.4 percent from 925 billion dollars a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The report said revolving credit including credit card totaled
394.8 billion dollars in December, up from 390.1 billion a month
earlier and automobile loans were up at a 13.8 percent rate or by
353.1 billion, compared with 15.3 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
But the category that includes loans for education, mobile home,
trailers and vacation fell at a 3.2 percent rate to 275.1 billion
from 275.8 billion, a first drop from last July.
</P>
<P>
The quick increase in household debt has been the reason given
by some banks that have begun tightening terms for loan approvals.
</P>
<P>
A recent Federal Reserve survey has shown that many banks had
started to tighten standards for approving a wide variety of loans
over the last three months, citing the increased household debt
burdens as one of the main reasons.

NEW YORK, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The New York stock market shot

Declining issues edged out advancers by less than 70 issues.
Big Board volume was heavy at over 400 million shares, but still
down from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
Technology stocks were declining from gains earlier in the
week. IBM, Texas Instruments, Compaq, Intel, Sun Microsystems and
Applied Materials were all lower.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UN Encourages More Female Education to Lower Fertility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A survey conducted and
released here today by a United Nations department shows that the
more women receive education, the lower fertility rate is.
</P>
<P>
The Population Division of the Department for Economic and
Social Information and Policy Analysis says that the pattern of
lowest fertility among the most educated women holds for all
societies.
</P>
<P>
In a cross-national study, the department surveyed 26
developing countries and found women with 10 or more years of
schooling have much lower fertility than women having no formal
schooling.
</P>
<P>
The survey made in Africa, Asia and Latin America indicates
that female education influences fertility in a number of ways. It
is associated with later age at marriage, desire for smaller
families and increased acceptance of and access to contraception.
</P>
<P>
For instance, in Burundi, Liberia, Mali, Senegal and Uganda,
the percentage of married women using contraception is four times
higher among women with 10 or more years of education than among
women having no formal schooling.
</P>
<P>
The department suggested that education be promoted primarily
as a matter of human rights and social justice.

<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit Further Narrows in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
narrowed dramatically in November, 1995 to 7.06 U.S. dollars, the
smallest in nearly two years, according to the U.S. Commerce
Department today.
</P>
<P>
The department said the deficit in goods and services dropped
a sharp 13.5 percent from a revised October figure of 8.16
billion dollars. It was the smallest imbalance since a 6.5
billion dollar deficit recorded in March 1994.
</P>
<P>
The monthly improvement reflected a big jump in exports of
capital goods such as aircraft and computer parts climbed to a
record level of 20.8 billion dollars. Sales of military goods,
including Patriot missiles to Saudi Arabia and helicopters to
Greece, also showed remarkably.
</P>
<P>
For November, the trade deficit with Japan dropped to 4.13
billion dollars, the lowest level since May 1993.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Canada, America's biggest trading partner,
narrowed to 1.8 billion dollars in November, but the imbalance
with Mexico, the other member in the North America Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), surged to 1.67 billion dollars, the highest
figure since last March.
</P>
<P>
The narrowing trade deficit in November reflected a 0.9
percent increase in exports of goods and services, which rose to
67.36 billion dollars, and a 0.7 percent drop in imports, which
dropped to 74.41 billion dollars. The improvement in the overall
deficit came despite the fact that America's oil import spending
jumped 7.5 percent to 4.59 billion dollars. The average price
per barrel of crude oil went down to 15.13 dollars in November.
</P>
<P>
The monthly trade deficit peaked in June last year at a
record 11.39 billion dollars and since then has been showing
gradual improvement.
</P>
<P>
However, even with the November improvement, the deficit for
the year is going on the track for an all-time record with the
imbalance in merchandise alone expected to reach some 162
billion dollars, surpassing the old mark of 152.1 billion
dollars set in 1987.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
launched on Wednesday an inter-agency appeal for the humanitarian
assistanceprogras in Sudan during 1996.
</P>
<P>
The appeal which updates emergency humanitarian assistance
requirements for war-affected and displaced populations throughout
that country, reflects the requirements of six United Nations
agencies and programs, among them are Food and Agriculture
Organization and U.N. Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
They will implement projects in seven main areas: food aid,
nutrition, health and water, agriculture, education, information
and coordination.
</P>
<P>
These programs proposals are based on the results of annual and
joint needs assessments missions carried out late last year by
several United Nations entities.
</P>
<P>
The consolidated inter-agency appeal for the Sudan in 1995 had
called for 101 million U.S. dollars, of which 50.6 million dollars
had been received.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Official Says Not Against Opening Hague Tribunal  Office in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb state is not
opposed to the opening of an office of the Hague tribunal in
Belgrade, a senior Bosnian Serb official said today.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb Vice-president Nikola Koljevic said that the
opening of the tribunal office is in the interest of all and the
Serb authority would not oppose such moves.
</P>
<P>
But he said the establishment of the truth is one thing, and
its use in political purpose is another.
</P>
<P>
He said that was why he had proposed to special U.N. human
rights rapporteur Elizabeth Rehn that future regular meetings on
human rights issues be held at the level of experts.
</P>
<P>
"Every top level meeting of this kind almost always becomes a
subject of propaganda and manipulation, and at the same times has
insufficient expertise," Tanjug news agency quoted Koljevic as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the suspension of relations with the
Muslim-Croat federation following the arrest of 11 Bosnian Serb
Army officers, the Serb official said that such a move was forced
and that the federation leadership was intentionally undermining
the implementation of the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The Serb officers were arrested on the IFOR-controlled
separation zone, and there is no provision in the Dayton agreement
which allows the Muslim-Croat federation to arrest and search for
alleged war criminals," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I nevertheless hope that this case will be resolved very soon
-- of course, provided NATO and IFOR genuinely desire a successful
implementation of the agreement," he added.

LUANDA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A European Union official
visiting here today urged Angolans to "grasp the last
opportunity" for the realization of peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to newsmen, Joao de Pinheiro, EU commissioner for
African, Caribbean and Pacific affairs, said as a rich state in
Africa, Angola will emerge from prolonged civil war and reach the
level it should develop in due time.
</P>
<P>
He urged that strict implementation of a lagging November 1994
peace accord signed in Zambia would provide Angolans with
confidence in their future.
</P>
<P>
This is the "last opportunity" for achieving peace and all
sides concerned should "grasp this opportunity to realize the
lasting peace," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the Angolan government and the Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) which has been blamed
for dragging its feet in sending its fighters to assembly areas
on time.
</P>
<P>
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi promised last month that 16,500 of
a declared total of 62,500 military personnel would report to
UN-sponsored assembly camps by February 8, prior to
demobilization or incorporation into a new army.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi said today increasing numbers of UNITA forces are in
fact going into the various quartering sites ... and pledged that
they would in fact be in the right places, if not on Thursday,
then certainly by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pinheiro arrived here on February 3. The Angolan Joint
Commission on peace process held a special meeting today to
welcome the EU official, in which both sides pledged to strictly
implement the peace agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 330,000 Children in
Angola died during the eight years between 1980 and 1988 when a
civil war were going on in the country, according the "State of
World Children 1996" made public by UNICEF here today.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF annual report notes that the civil war not only
had negative impact on the children's physical development, but
also hurt their feelings as not a few of them had seen killing,
torturing and other horrifying atrocities.
</P>
<P>
The report lists landmines as one of the factors that gravely
threaten the life of children. A UN statistics shows that there
are 110 million landmines in 64 countries worldwide. UNICEF in
its report urges an adoption of a law to ban production, trading,
storing and exporting of landmines in the world.

<HEADLINE> Apple Denies Involvement in Merger Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Apple Computer Inc. today
broke its silence for the last weeks by claiming that it is not
involved in merger talks "with any party."
</P>
<P>
The Cupertino, California-based company said it was abandoning
a policy of not responding to "rumor and speculation" to deny
reports that a merger was being negotiated because the takeover
speculation was having a "destabilizing effect" on its business.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. computer giant also said it expected an operating loss
for the first three months of this year to exceed the loss
reported for the last three months of 1995, usually the best time
of year for sale.
</P>
<P>
The company lost 69 million dollars in the quarter, forecast
another loss for the first three months of 1996 and has begun
laying off 1,300 of its 14,500 employees. There had been reports
for nearly a month that Sun Microsystems Inc., the leading maker
of computer workstations used in engineering and research, was
courting Apple.
</P>
<P>
But the prospect of a deal seemed to dim after Apple appointed
a new chief executive last Friday. The new leader, Gil Amelio, who
stepped down as chief executive of National Semiconductor Corp. to
take the new position in a bid to resuscitate Apple first.
</P>
<P>
However, today's statement did not confirm or deny that Apple
had ever had merger talks with Sun Microsystems Inc.; it only
indicated that "currently" there were no talks under way with
anyone.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Amelio said that despite the company's recent
disappointing performance, "the foundations of our business are
sound."

DAMASCUS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The second batch of the
Japanese troops, comprising of 29 men, arrived in Damascus this
evening to join the U.N. peacekeeping force on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
A first batch of 16 soliders arrived on February 1.

<P>
General Johannes Kosters, commander of the 1,000-strong
Disengagement Observation Force, greeted the 29 Japanese soliders
at Damascus International Airport.
</P>
<P>
In his welcome address, Kosters said although the total number
of the Japanese unit is 45 men, it is of particular importance as
it will provide logistical support through the transport of the
U.N. peacekeeping force. The Japanese contingent is replacing a
Canadian transport unit.
</P>
<P>
The Disengagement Observation Force, formed in 1974, monitors
the cease-fire line between Syrian and Israeli forces. The line
was established following the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.

JOHANNESBURG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's General
Services minister Cris Fismer is to replace Roelf Meyer as
Minister of Provincial Affairs and Constitutional Development.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by South Africa's Deputy President and
National Party (NP) leader F. W. de Klerk in Cape Town today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, De Klerk said Fismer's appointment
would take effect on March 1 when Meyer left his cabinet post to
become the NP's Secretary-General, while NP's Gauteng Provincial
Minister John Mavuso would take over Fismer's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said the appointments were made in accordance with
the constitution and after proper consultation with President
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
However, he reiterated that Meyer would remain the NP's chief
constitutional negotiator and Fismer retain ministerial
responsibility for legislation on the control of gambling and
lotteries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a surprising move, De Klerk announced that
Constitutional Assembly Deputy Chairman and former NP cabinet
minister Leon Wessels would leave public life when the
constitution-writing process ended in May this year.

remuneration, saying they were overworked because of the large
number of committees they had to belong to.
</P>
<P>
they further urged faster progress with investigating a

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bosnian Peace Process in Crisis After Detention of Serb Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The fragile peace process in
Bosnia-Herzegovina has hit fresh problems after the arrest of two
senior Serb officers by the Muslim-led government.
</P>
<P>
The Serb authorities announced on Wednesday they were calling
off meetings with EU High Representative for Bosnian Civilian
Affairs Carl Bildt and with Britain's Prince Charles scheduled for
later this week.
</P>
<P>
Contacts and meetings with the Muslim-Croat federation have
also been cancelled to protest against the detention of two Serb
officers and at least six soldiers in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
General Djordje Djukic, Colonel Aleksa Mrsmanovic and their
driver, were arrested by the Bosnian government on January 30 in a
NATO-controlled area between the suburbs of Lukavica and Ilidza,
en route for talks with NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
The two are not on the list of suspected war criminals indicted
by the Hague International War Crimes Tribunal. But the
Muslim-led government has accused the two officers of murder and
of organizing the killing of civilians during the three and half
year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The incident has aroused strong anger from the Serb leadership
which warned the action would jeopardize the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"General Djukic must be released if peace is to be reached in
Bosnia-Herzegovina," General Milan Gvero, deputy chief of staff of
the Serb army, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Serb Vice-President Nikola Koljevic also accused the
Muslim-Croat federation of undermining the Bosnia peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"By making this move, the Muslim side showed extreme
irresponsibility and recklessness, as if it does not care at all
about the possible consequences of the case," Tanjug news agency
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The detention of the Serb officers and soldiers is likely to
damage the peace process, observers and analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The new row between the two sides, who agreed to end their
bloody civil war only two months ago, will further weaken efforts
by the international community to build confidence between the
three ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
"The recent incident will certainly deepen the existing
mistrust between the Serbs and Muslims and force them to be more
cautious in making real peace in the country," said a western
diplomat who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 Serbs have already moved out of
Serb-controlled suburbs of Sarajevo in fear of retaliation and
discrimination when the area comes under the control of the
Muslim-Croat federation after March 19.
</P>
<P>
This incident is likely to exacerbate those fears and prompt
more Serbs to flee their homes rather than stay in the city after
the March 19 deadline expires.
</P>
<P>
To persuade the Serbs to stay and live alongside their former
enemies, both IFOR commander Admiral Leighton Smith and High
Representative Bildt have made strenuous efforts to calm their
fears by guaranteeing them the security of IFOR troops.
</P>
<P>
They have even pressed the Bosnian government to allow Serb
police to stay in the Serb-held part of Sarajevo until March 19
although they should have withdrawn by February 3 in line with the
Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
A mass exodus of Serbs from Sarajevo would deal a heavy blow to
the peace accord as well as to the Muslim-led government which
wants to see a multi-ethnic capital city.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of the Serb officers may also lead Serbs to take
revenge by seizing Muslims, thus further complicating the
situation and making freedom of movement by civilians in the
country more difficult.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs have blamed IFOR for not pressuring the government to
release the Serb detainees and are threatening to sever contact
and stop cooperation with IFOR if a proper solution is not found.
</P>
<P>
General Zdravko Tolimir, chief of staff of the Serb Army told
the IFOR commander during talks in Pale that IFOR should be held
responsible for the arrests because the two officers were seized
in IFOR-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
The Western diplomat said the Serbs are justified in showing
their anger to the world and are determined to get their men
released.
</P>
<P>
"This is a test bed for more arrests of suspected war criminals
in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the two officers are not won back, then more and senior
Serb leaders indicted by the international war crimes tribunal,
including Serb President Radovan Karadzic and military commander
Ratko Mladic, will be the next targets of the Bosnian government."
</P>
<P>
The Hague International War Crimes Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia has indicted 52 war criminals in Bosnia - 45 Serbs and
seven Croats.
</P>
<P>
To try and cool the dispute, IFOR has urged the two parties to
show restraint and continue to cooperate with IFOR in compliance
with the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
General William Carter, chief-of-staff of IFOR troops in
Bosnia, told reporters Wednesday, "We are extremely concerned
about the impact this action could have on progress toward full
compliance with the Dayton peace agreement."
