<HEADLINE> NAM Remains Recognizing Afghanistan's Rabbani: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Durban, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Non-Aligned Movement will
continue recognizing President Buhanuddin Rabbani as the
legitimate representative of Afghanistan at its meeting, which
kicked off here Saturday morning, an organizer said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
NAM spokesman Marco Boni said South Africa as the host country
of the NAM summit has been guided by the United Nations which
still recognizes Rabbani's government.
</P>
<P>
"So long as the United Nations recognizes the Rabbani
government, the NAM will continue to support the current
Afghanistan government," Boni told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
An informed source, who asked not be named, said that the NAM
had decided to continue its support for the Rabbani government
after a series of debate among NAM organizers on which delegation
should represent the Republic of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Boni said the NAM has officially invited the Rabbani
government to participate in the summit. Rabani's Deputy Foreign
Minister was scheduled to arrive in Durban later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the question whether the Taliban has applied for
the participation of the summit, Boni said, "It is not a matter
of our concern. We only accept application from the legitimate
government."
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of Afghanistan territory is reportedly
under the control of the Taliban Movement.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban earlier this month approached the U.N. to revoke
recognition of Rabbani's government and to allow Afghanistan's
seat in the U.N. General Assembly to be occupied by a Taliban
representative.

ADDIS ABABA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi left here Saturday for a three-day working visit to
the Great Lakes region which comprises Rwanda, Burundi, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency reported that Premier Meles,
accompanied by Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin, will also confer
with officials of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) on ways of resolving the crisis in Democratic Congo.
</P>
<P>
The report did not disclose how many countries the Ethiopian
leader will visit, but said the discussions between Prime
Minister Meles and leaders of the region will focus on the
positions of Great Lakes countries regarding the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The report said the problem in Democratic Congo is a threat to
peace in Africa, adding that Ethiopia will contribute its share
to the peaceful resolution of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Congolese President Laurent Kabila faces a
rebellion that started in the east of the country on August 2.
The fighting is now in suburbs of Kinshasa, capital of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of invading to back the
ethnic Tutsi-led rebels, but the two deny the charge. Angola,
Zimbabwe and Namibia have sent troops to support President
Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Financial, Political Turmoil Likely to Top NAM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, South Africa, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Senior NAM
officials met here behind closed doors Saturday in the shadow of
this week's meltdown on world financial markets and continued
political turmoil in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The officials, representing 113 member states of the
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), split into two committees for
deliberations on economic and political issues.
</P>
<P>
NAM's economic committee is being chaired by Tanzania, while
the political committee is presided over by Iran.
</P>
<P>
In addition to political issues such as terrorism, the
financial crisis would help foster consensus among developing
countries about the threat posed by globalization, an informed
source told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In the past, NAM's member states were not equally affected by
currency crashes and globalization, because their levels of
economic development and sophistication differed considerably,
said the source close to the senior officials meeting which
opened Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
But now everyone was affected adversely, he added.
</P>
<P>
The threat that market forces posed to governments, and what
they should do to try and lessen their impact, is expected to be
hotly debated at the 12th NAM summit, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Other economic issues to be discussed at the NAM summit
include the role of the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Developing nations want these institutions to play a more
benevolent role and to be less prescriptive to countries they
assisted, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Both committees were still meeting late Saturday afternoon,
and details of their discussions were not yet available.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Rebels Not Invited to NAM Summit: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Saturday denied an
allegation that it had invited representatives of the rebel
forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as guests of
the 12th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit.
</P>
<P>
"We as host can only invite NAM member countries. If rebel
movements are interested in coming to lobby, they have to do so
in their private capacity," NAM spokesman Marco Boni told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, foreign mass media quoted a senior Congolese official
in Harare, Zimbabwe, as reporting that South Africa had invited
representatives of the rebel forces in Congo (K) as guests of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
"We reject this absolutely because this gives the rebel
movement legitimacy," the unidentified Congolese diplomat was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
NAM officials believed that the confusion may have arisen
because the name of former Congolese foreign minister Bizima
Karaha appeared on the official list of DRC delegates.
</P>
<P>
At the time of his inclusion, Karaha was still Congolese
foreign minister, but he had since joined the rebel movement, NAM
officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to a Congolese official, who asked not to be named,
President Laurent Kabila of Democratic Congo will attend the NAM
Summit due to be held here between September 2 and 3.
</P>
<P>
However, the official declined to give any details for
"security" reasons.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian police have
impounded 163 stolen automobiles in a special crackdown earlier
this week, the Director of Criminal Investigation Adadi Rajabu
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 82 are alleged to have been stolen in Tanzania,
79 from South Africa, one from Malawi and one from Swaziland,
Rajabu told reporters at the Oysterbay Police Station where the
seized vehicles of different makes are parked.
</P>
<P>
In the swoop, Rajabu said, 17 suspects along with 27 guns were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
Police officers from different Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries have cooperated in the exercise,
carried out during August 24-27, according to the director.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about two to three vehicles are stolen
every week, a rate which Rajabu described as lower than that of
other countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned that "effective measures must be taken
to keep the car theft trend downwards."

U.S. dollars, the official news agency IRNA reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Energy Minister Habibollah Bitaraf was quoted as saying that
Iran's power generation capacity now stands at 25,000 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
He said that some 1,400 megawatts of electricity would be

<HEADLINE> NAM Nations Should Sign Arms Non-Proliferation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will push for the
signing of an agreement banning weapons of mass destruction and
land-mines by member states of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM),
South African Defense Minister Joe Modise said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We will appeal and continue to persuade the world, especially
NAM members to sign the treaty on non-proliferation of arms,"
Modise said in Durban where the 12th NAM summit is to be held.
</P>
<P>
The non-proliferation treaty seems to be bound to fail as long
as there are countries still clinging to their weapons but
expecting others to destroy theirs.
</P>
<P>
"I think the key thing should be a very massive campaign that
will ensure the abolition of these weapons because they maim
people," Modise said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is proud it has managed to destroy its
stockpiles, and will encourage other NAM nations to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
On the continuing conflict between government troops and
rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Modise reiterated
South Africa's position that the conflict would only be resolved
through political dialog, not military means.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of troops by neighboring countries is a
short-term measure, which will result in huge spending and debts,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
South Africa would continue to push for a negotiated
settlement, and would use whatever opportunity available during
the NAM summit to bring the warring parties to the negotiation
table in an attempt to bring lasting peace, said the defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
The latest developments of fighting between rebels and aligned
forces around Kinshasa will have to be given special attention
when United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and Organization
of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim arrived here
for the NAM summit.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Coalition Partners Agree on Joint Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The two ruling parties in
Nepal Saturday reached a 25-point agreement on policies and
priorities of the new coalition government with focus on law and
order in the country, the official RSS news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement said that the present government has been formed
to maintain law and order in the country, preserve territorial
integrity, strengthen multi-party democratic system, guarantee
human rights, hold the forthcoming elections in a free and fair
manner and strengthen the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Girija Prasad Koirala, the prime
minister and president of the Nepali Congress (NC) and Sahana
Pradhan, president of the Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML).
</P>
<P>
Koirala reshuffled his cabinet Wednesday to induct the CPN-ML,
turning the NC minority government into a coalition.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed one day before Koirala is scheduled to
fly to Durban, South Africa for the 12th summit of the Non-Aligned
Movement.
</P>
<P>
It said that the two parties will provide guidelines to the
government in safeguarding the life and property of the people and
maintaining law and order.
</P>
<P>
It promised to bring prices of daily consumer goods under
control and make legal arrangement to have senior political
leaders and high-ranking government officials disclose their
properties so as to control and eliminate corruption and abuse of
authority and other serious social anomalies and crimes.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stated that the policy of promoting liberal,
competitive and just economic structure will be continued and the
government will concentrate its efforts on implementing programs
against poverty and unemployment and expediting the process of
industrialization.
</P>
<P>
The government will be activated to help the Election
Commission by creating a congenial atmosphere for holding free and
fair elections, the agreement stated.
</P>
<P>
The fresh general elections in the country are due before
November 1999.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stated that as per the declared stand of the
government that Kalapani in far-western Nepal is Nepalese
territory on the basis of historical evidences available with
Nepal and that the Indian army should be evacuated from there,
talks should be held to resolve all border-related problems and
other issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It also said that steps will be taken to resolve the issue of
Bhutanese refugees by soliciting the good offices of India.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are staying in eight U.N.-run
camps in eastern Nepal after being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989
and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Seven rounds of ministerial talks between Nepal and Bhutan had
failed to produce any result. India has refused to get involved,
saying it is a bilateral issue.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Condemns Israeli Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Yemen on Saturday slammed Israel's
decision to expand settlements in the occupied East Jerusalem and
Golan Heights, saying it is violating the international law.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Yemeni Foreign Ministry said the
international law bans the occupier from changing the status of
the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
"Based on its total solidarity with the Arab people in
Palestine, Lebanon and Syria, the Republic of Yemen strongly
condemns the Israeli practices that constitute violation of the
international law," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said Israel's decision to build new settlements in the
occupied Palestinian and Syrian territories was a defiance of the
international legitimacy and a grave threat to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The ministry reminded Israel of the fact that the Arabs chose
the path of peace with a sincere will to establish security and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Yemen urges the international community in general and the UN
Security Council in particular to put an end to the Israeli
practices, otherwise they "will inevitably lead to more violence
and destabilization in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Yemen backs the call for holding a full
Arab summit to formulate a strategy to deal with the challenges
posed by the Israeli acts.
</P>
<P>
Israel's continued expansion of Jewish settlements has been one
of the outstanding obstacles blocking the progress of the
Israeli-Arab peace process, which has been stalled on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided in April to extend the municipal boundaries of
Jerusalem to incorporate some Jewish suburbs and eight Jewish
settlements in the West Bank. This was aimed at consolidating its
control over the whole Jerusalem, especially the Arab East
Jerusalem it captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Recent media reports said Israel has decided to build a
settlement in the Ras Amoud Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli government on August 19 approved a plan to
build 4,800 new housing units in four settlements in the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
Before this, the 120-member Knesset (Parliament) in late July
passed the preliminary reading of the so-called Golan Heights
bill, which demanded an absolute majority of 61 Knesset members
and a public referendum majority to approve any territorial
concessions or changes in status.
</P>
<P>
This was seen as an attempt to reject any territorial
compromise on the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in
1967. This has dampened the prospect for a quick resumption of the
Israeli-Syrian peace talks that have been suspended since early
1996.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Peace Overture by Gulf States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran said Saturday it welcomed
the overture made by the Persian Gulf states on improving
relations with Tehran, but adding it stands firm on the disputed
islands in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry's spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi was
quoted by the official Iranian News Agency as saying that "one of
the basic principles of Iran's foreign policy is to promote and
strengthen relations with the neighboring and Muslim countries,
particularly those nations of the Persian Gulf region."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed Iran still insists that the disputed islands in
the Persian Gulf are "an integral part of Iranian territory."
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi made the remarks in response to the communique
issued Friday at the end of 68th ministerial meeting of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic group formed by
Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and United Arab
Emirates (UAE), called for talks to resolve all disputes and
unifying efforts to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said Iran expressed "delight over the steps" taken in
the direction of bolstering relations and mutual confidence
building between the Gulf states and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the GCC members, particularly Saudi
Arabia, warmed up following the election of Iran's moderate
President Mohammad Khatami in May last year. Khatami has expressed
willingness to achieve Iran's peaceful coexistence with the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that broadening and deepening of relations and
regional cooperation are the only way to bring about stability
and security in the strategic Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
"Continued exchange of visits and talks, and promotion of
cooperation between the nations of the region is the best strategy
for improving mutual trust between regional states and eliminating
misunderstanding," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the islands of the Greater and Lesser Tunbs as
well as Abu Musa, he said they are "an integral part of the
Iranian territory" and Iran is willing to hold continued
negotiations with the UAE on settling the disputes.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the islands at the mouth of the strategic Hormuz
Strait in 1971 after the British colonist forces withdrew from the
region. However, both Tehran and Abu Dhabi have claimed full
sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between Iran and the UAE were reduced to
the level of charge d'affaires in 1992 after the UAE lodged a
protest against Iran's full control on the islands.
</P>
<P>
While Iran has urged the UAE to settle the territorial disputes
through bilateral talks, Abu Dhabi calls for international
arbitration over the issue.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Set up Multi-Million Steel Joint Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Saturday sealed an agreement
with three giant international companies on setting up an iron and
steel plant to tap iron sources in the southern tourist resort of
Aswan, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri witnessed the signing
of the agreement by Egypt's Aswan Company for Development and
Mining, Manesman Demag of Germany, the American company U.S. Steel
and Siglik Company of France.
</P>
<P>
The new company, Aswan Iron and Steel Company, which has an
authorized capital of 2 billion Egyptian pounds (588.2 million
U.S. dollars) and 816 million pounds (240 million dollars) in
issued capital, will provide much-needed iron and steel products
in two years to the ongoing development projects in South Valley
area.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of State for Planning and International
Cooperation Zafer el-Beshri said that the Egyptian side will
provide 60 percent of capital of the new firm and 26 percent will
be offered by public subscription.
</P>
<P>
The plant will begin operation in May 2001 with a production
capacity of 1.4 million tonnes of iron in the first stage, 540,000
tonnes of which will be exported. The project will create 3,000
job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The company has been allocated 1 million square meters for
building its production complex, and another 1 million square
meters for housing employees and workers.
</P>
<P>
The company has got a 25-year concession to use mining raw
materials in an area of 2,840 square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Development in Russia Encouraging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Saturday it was encouraged by acting Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin's quick reassurances about his country's crumbling
economy.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, re-appointed by President Boris Yeltsin this
week, earlier Saturday ruled out any return to Russia's Soviet
past and also assembled a group of senior reformers to prepare
urgent measures to halt the country's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to comment at this point until they have a
government, they formally have their economic team and they
formally lay out their economic program, but certainly it is
encouraging," said P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the president's
national security council.
</P>
<P>
"They are going to continue on the path of economic reform
(and) that's clearly what we are encouraging them to do," said the
spokesman, who is with Clinton vacationing on the island of
Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, U.S. officials told a background briefing that the
U.S. has a vital interest in keeping Russia going forward with its
market reforms and democracy.
</P>
<P>
It would be a serious error for Russia to revert to a policy of
central control of its economy, said Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
"It is our belief that a move back towards centralized planning
based on price controls and administrative allocation of goods and
systematic controls would be a serious policy error and very
unfortunate with respect to Russia's economic prospects going
forward," Summers told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Denies Intention to Downgrade Ties With Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Sudan on Saturday denied the
press report that it intends to downgrade its diplomatic relations
with Egypt, the Sudanese News Agency (SNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Relations
Hassan Abdin was quoted by the SNA as saying that Sudan's
Ambassador to Egypt Ahmed Abdul-Halim, who was called back to
Khartoum only for consultations, would return to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
When Abdul-Halim returns to Cairo, he will prepare for
concluding Sudan's presidency of the Arab League, Abdin added.
</P>
<P>
Abdin made the remarks after the Sudanese political independent
daily Alwan reported Friday that "Sudan called in its ambassador
to Egypt in protest against Egypt's hosting of the Sudanese armed
opposition."
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Egypt hosted a three-day meeting of Sudanese
National Democratic Alliance, the umbrella group of all Sudanese
opposition factions in the north and south.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Cairo hosting of the conference of all Sudanese
opposition factions showed its open hostility against Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has not so far nominated any new ambassador to Sudan
since the demise of the late ambassador, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The daily predicted that the Sudanese diplomatic representation
in Cairo would continue at the level of charge d'affairs in line
with the resolutions of the Sudanese National Assembly
(Parliament).
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that the Sudanese-Egyptian
ties are passing through a delicate stage and could turn tense
after the failure of the talks on recovery of the Egyptian assets
confiscated by the Sudanese government in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Sudan have been at odds over a border dispute and
accusing each other of harboring its opposition with the aim to
overthrow the government.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Threatens to Intervene in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Foreign Minister
Anastase Gasana warned Saturday that his country would send
troops into Democratic Congo (DRC) if the latest mediation
efforts led by South African President Nelson Mandela fail.
</P>
<P>
"We will have no choice but to intervene militarily (so as) to
go and rescue Rwandans who are living in the DRC," Gasana told
reporters in Durban here where the 12th NAM conference is being
held.
</P>
<P>
Gasana is here to participate in foreign ministers' meeting,
which is a preparatory one for the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)
Summit scheduled on Wednesday and Thursday of next week.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has for days protested against the harassment and
killings of its citizens in Congo (K), vowing to do everything
possible to save those trapped in the conflict "simply because
they did not support the Congolese government led by President
Laurent Kabila".
</P>
<P>
Gasana called on NAM members and the international Community
to support Mandela's initiative for a peaceful resolution of the
Congolese conflict which has resulted in tense situation in the
former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who took power in Congo after he overthrew the
32-year-old rule of Mobutu Sese Seko in May last year, accused
Rwanda and Uganda of backing the rebels. He has received military
support from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia to quell the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Mandela and his government has been
trying to realize a peace settlement in the conflicts between the
Kabila government and rebel forces in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Mandela initiated a small-range Southern African Development
Community summit in Pretoria, South Africa about two weeks ago in
a bid to persuade the warring parties and their supporters to
cease fire and to start peace negotiations. However, so far there
is no sign of progress after the mediation.

<HEADLINE> Destroyed Sudanese Factory Produces Only Drugs: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The alleged chemical weapons plant
in Sudan destroyed by U.S. air strikes earlier this month in
anti-terrorism operations actually produced only pharmaceuticals,
said German media reports Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the German news magazines Der Spiegel and Focus,
German Ambassador to Sudan Werner Daum had sent a telegram to the
German Foreign Ministry after the U.S. air strikes on August 20,
reporting that the Sudanese plant produced only pharmaceuticals,
like anti-malaria drugs and antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
The factory also had no disguise and had not been kept as a
secret site, the ambassador reportedly said in the telegram.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, however, insisted that they had physical
evidence that the plant, in an industrial district north of the
Sudanese capital of Khartoum, was producing chemicals used in
nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attacks were launched in retaliation against the
August 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which
killed more than 260 people.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has protested the attacks to the United
Nations, calling them an offense against its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The German Foreign Ministry Saturday declined to give any
direct comment on the news reports, but noted that ambassadors'
reports did necessarily reflect government positions.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Stresses Need for Cease-fire in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba stressed in Harare, capital of Zimbabwe, Saturday the
need for a cease-fire in Democratic Congo (DRC) as a way of
resolving the conflict in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint press briefing with his Zimbabwean
counterpart Robert Mugabe before his departure at Harare
International Airport after concluding a three-day visit, Chiluba
said there is need for a cease-fire first before the issue of
foreign troops to pull out can come in, according to Zambia News
Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said at both regional summits held in Zimbabwe and
South Africa earlier this month, the governments that met
recognized the government of President Laurent Kabila of Congo
(K) and therefore at the summit in South Africa on August 22,
they realized the need to secure a cease-fire for Congo.
</P>
<P>
He added that with the recent developments in Congo, he could
see a situation where there would be no need of keeping foreign
troops there.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Mugabe condemned "hypocritical"
countries that talked peace during the day but resorted to war at
night.
</P>
<P>
He said there was evidence that the war in Congo was not as a
result of rebels but was sponsored, in its origin, by its
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He cited Rwanda and Uganda as having the majority troops in
the rebel group, adding these were "hypocritical" countries and
any other country that compromised with them was also
hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean president said there was no need to start with
Congolese President Laurent Kabila to cease fire because he was
not the one that started the war and that it was only reasonable
to ask those who started the war to hold a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also noted that the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
must take up the issue of resolving the Congo conflict because it
was "impossible" for the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) countries to do so with such division.
</P>
<P>
This is apparently referring to the rift among some SADC
members over the attitude to the civil war in Congo which started
on August 2.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia as well as some other members
agreed to help Kabila militarily and the three countries have
sent troops to fight with Kinshasa against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African President Mandela, incumbent SADC
chairman, insisted that there must be a peaceful solution to
ending the war.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Said Not to Be Worried About Iran's Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia
said Sunday that Iran's planned military exercises close to the
Afghan border pose no threat to their country.
</P>
<P>
"Iran will be holding exercises 25 kilometers inside its
territory. Our frontiers are safe and we can deal with any
threat," Saecdur Rahman, the Taliban's representative in Pakistan,
said in an interview with Xinhua on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced Saturday that it will hold military exercises
involving 70,000 troops along the border with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban official said they have no intention to engage in
war with Iran or other neighboring country. Instead, they want
good ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the Taliban abducted 11 Iranian nationals early
this month in northern Afghanistan, an accusation which Iran has
repeatedly made against it, and invited Iran to hold talks on
other Iranian nationals in their detention.
</P>
<P>
He called on Iran to recognize ground realities in Afghanistan
and act impartially in the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
The hard-line militia, which now controls 90 percent of Afghan
territory, accuses Iran of supporting the opposition Northern
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban envoy condemned the recent U.S. missile attack on
alleged terrorist training camps of Saudi billionaire Osama bin
Laden within Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Launching attack on a sovereign country without evidence is a
sheer violation of international and even American own laws. The
Americans made murderous attempt on the life of a person, against
whom they have no evidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Taliban will not hand over Laden to
anybody. "He is our guest. We are obliged to protect him under the
Islamic and Afghan traditions. No question arises to hand him over
to any other country."
</P>
<P>
However, he said his government is against and condemns
terrorism in all forms and everywhere in the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, on Saturday
stressed that Deng Xiaoping ardently advocated the rule of law and
his thoughts on building democracy and a legal framework in China
constitute very important parts of his theory.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a lecture on law and legal acuity held at the Great
Hall of the People, Li said that Deng Xiaoping was seriously
concerned about democratic and legal construction in China and
noted that the late leader repeatly stressed the importance of
establishing rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Deng regarded the rule of law as fundamental and recognized its
lasting reliability once established. The late leader also outlined
the basic characteristics of a system which features a
comprehensive set of laws which combines resolute and rigid law
enforecement and prevents anyone from placing themselves above the
law.
</P>
<P>
Deng emphasized that democratic and legal construction should
be carried out under the leadership of the Communist Party of
China in a gradual and orderly fashion, said Li.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Deng's thoughts on democratic and legal
construction should be the guidelines for perfecting the system of
the people's congresses and urged People's Congresses at all
levels and members of all standing committees of the people's
congresses to resolutely study Deng's theory and fully realize
their duties and responsibilities for introducing the rule of law
in China.

BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Beijing
Guo'an failed to score any single goal at their home turf against
a second-division team, and was mercilelessly kicked out of the
Chinese Football Association tournament here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Against Liaoning Tianrun who scored a 1-0 win in the first leg
of their third round match, Beijing Guo'an, twice champions in
the FA Cup, dispatched their first-string footballers but failed
to slice open the tight defense of their opponents who resorted
to counter-attack tactics throughout the 90-minute competition.
</P>
<P>
Eager to open their account, the Guo'an players dominated the
pitch in their momentum but seldom created any real chances in
front of the visitors' goalmouth.
</P>
<P>
"Our team was plunged into a low mood in the second half of
the year," said Guo'an head coach Shen Xiangfu, "I had to
shoulder the responsibility for the failure."
</P>
<P>
Local fans were forced to yell "resignation" against coach
Shen who said later "I will not hide back and will have my say
for the club and for the fans."
</P>
<P>
However, league champions Dalian Wanda won their away game
against Vanguard Huandao 1-0 and advanced to the semifinals of
the FA tournament together with Shanghai Shenhua and Shandong
Luneng.
</P>
<P>
Despite the absence of injured ace strikers Wang Tao and Hao
Haidong, Dalian Wanda still enjoyed upperhands in the pitch with
the sole goal scored in the 24th minute by Wang Pen.
</P>
<P>
Although the Huandao players accelerated their attacks in the
second half, Dalian Wanda still managed to keep their momentum
and eventually booked their semifinal berth 3-0 in aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Shenhua who won their away game 2-1 three days ago,
routed Sichuan Quanxing 3-1 in their home game, becoming one of
the last four with an aggregated score of 5-2.
</P>
<P>
In the first 12 minutes, Shenhua scored twice through its
Brazilian import Marcelo, and increased their advantage in the
73rd minute before Yao Xia netted in a morale-enhancing goal for
Sichuan Quanxing.
</P>
<P>
Shandong Luneng won their away game 2-0 against the Chinese
Army to advance into the semifinals 5-1 in aggregate, however the
two goals were all netted by their foreign import.

<HEADLINE> Hill Wins Rain-Hit Formula One Belgian GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Damon Hill won Sunday's
Formula One Grand Prix Belgian race at Spa-Francorchamps after 14
drivers were forced one after another to drop out by rain-caused
crashes.
</P>
<P>
The Briton, who won the Belgian stop of the grand prix back in
1993 and 1994 before German rival Michael Schumacher won the next
three races, drove without a hitch for the remaining 14 laps.
</P>
<P>
Ralf Schumacher, younger brother of leader Schumacher at
Sunday's race which had to be re-started after a 13-car collision
on the first start-up, came home second for a one-two finish for
the Jordan Honda team.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher was 0.93 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
Hill, the world driver champion in 1996, clocked an
accumulated time of one hour 43 minutes 47.40 seconds for an
average speed of 177.229 kilometers per hour for the 44-lap race.
</P>
<P>
The Briton's highest speed on the rain-soaked track for the
day was 306.577 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Hill enjoyed a temporary lead after re-start before three-time
Spa-Francorchamps titlist Schumacher grabbed away the lead for
the next 20 laps.
</P>
<P>
But the German driver, who lost last year's world championship
to Canadian Jacques Villeneuve, squandered a 30-second lead to
try to overtake David Coulthard on the 25th lap, only to see his
far-side front wheel snatched off by a collision with Coulthard's
car.
</P>
<P>
Championship overall leader Mika Hakkinen of Finland had to
bow out of the Belgian grand prix due to a first-bend accident on
the re-start.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 cars were involved in a collision within 200
meters after the first start of the day's race which was held in
heavy rains. The re-start was held an hour later.
</P>
<P>
The multiple pile-up was caused by Coulthard who started from
the pole position. Coulthard spun out of control on wet tracks wh
ile the cars behind were unable to avoid crashing into him.
</P>
<P>
Two of the 13 drivers who were involved in the accident, Eddie
Ivrine and Rubens Barrichello, got slightly hurt in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Olivier Panis, Ricardo Rosset, Mika Salo and Barrichello, ho
wever, did not join in the ranks for the second start-up.
</P>
<P>
Hill grabbed an early lead after re-starting but defending
champion Michael Schumacher from Germany snatched back the
leader's position after six laps.
</P>
<P>
The German driver, who is a wet-track expert and back-to-back
winner at Spa-Francorchamps from 1995 to 1997, could have easily
won Sunday's race which saw one more crash that forced two more
drop-outs.
</P>
<P>
Hill and Ralf Schumacher combined to increase their team
points standing to 26 for a fifth position. Hill accumulated 16
driver's points while Ralf got 15 after Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
Mika Hakkinen of Finland still leads this year's championship
with 77 points, followed by Michael Schumacher on 70 points.
</P>
<P>
Teammates had to separate Michael Schumacher who went to
square with Coulthard after the critical crash that cost him the
opportunity to overtake Hakkinen on the championship standing.

<P>
TIANJIN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin resident Zhang Xiulin,
42, recently received 70,000 yuan (8,433 US dollars) in
compensation for her dilapidated 15-sq.m. house which will be
demolished as part of the government housing reconstruction
program.
</P>
<P>
Zhang used the funds and her bank savings to purchase a
50-sq.m. apartment on the local real estate market.
</P>
<P>
"We would still be living in the same old house our family has
lived in for generations without the program," said Zhang, one of the
many beneficiaries of the ongoing housing reconstruction project
in the largest port city of north China.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of citizens in Tianjin, a city with a
population of over nine million, have for decades lived in rundown
single-story houses lacking toilet facilities.
</P>
<P>
The city government plans to dramatically alter the situation
by demolishing dilapidated houses with floor space of over seven
million sq.m. and build new housing between 1994-2000.
</P>
<P>
Families living in dwelling scheduled for demolition will
receive fair compensation from the government and will then be
able to purchase new homes on the open market.
</P>
<P>
The city has already constructed apartment buildings with floor
space of some 12.82 million sq.m. on 5.52 million sq.m. of land
currently occupied by dilapidated structures.
</P>
<P>
The program has benefited 150,000 displaced families, which
account for about 60 percent of people purchasing new homes.
</P>
<P>
The city's per capita living space jumped from 9.86 sq.m. in
1993 to 12.3 sq.m. in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhifeng, an official in the city's construction committee,
said the project will not only improve living conditions for low
income earners, but will also lead to a resurgence in the local
real estate market.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bangladeshi PM Quits NAM Summit, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina left here Sunday afternoon for Makkah, Saudi Arabia, to
perform "Umrah," after canceling her plan to attend the
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit to be held in South Africa in
early September.
</P>
<P>
She would pray to the "Almighty Allah" for blessings for the
flood victims in Bangladesh and meet with Bangladeshi expatriates
in Makkah before returning home on Tuesday, reports said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad said the prime
minister had canceled her scheduled trip to Durban, South Africa,
for the 12th NAM summit slated for September 2 and 3 "for
exigencies of catastrophic floods" in the country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here, however, expressed doubt about the reason the
foreign minister cited for the cancellation. What the foreign
minister said might be true, but the untold was the consideration
of the political conflict between the ruling party and the
opposition, they said.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged flood, starting to hit Bangladesh in early July,
has left nearly 400 people dead and affected more than 20 million
people across the country. While official estimates of immediate
material and infrastructure losses were about 2.5 billion taka
(53.2 million U.S. dollars), unofficial sources put the losses at
220 billion to 300 billion taka (4.68 billion to 6.38 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
As of Saturday, the government had distributed 36.75 million
taka (about 781,900 dollars) and 58,816 tons of rice among the
flood victims, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We are passing days and nights virtually unfed. Whatever
little relief we have so far got was not enough for me and five
members of my family," a report in the latest issue of Dhaka
Courier weekly quoted a flood victim as saying.
</P>
<P>
The inadequate relief operations of the government, the
analysts said, had caused discontent among the flood-hit people,
which in return would diminish support for the present government.
</P>
<P>
As the NAM summit would bring no immediate economic benefit to
the country, a trip to Saudi Arabia to pray for the flood victims
would surely impress Bangladeshis that their prime minister is
showing concern over the miseries of the flood victims, the
analysts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
And Hasina would ask the Bangladeshi expatriates there to
extend assistance in mitigating the problems caused by floods at
home, a practical move that might, to a certain degree, regain
support for her government, according to the analysts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister turned down a call from the
opposition parties to set up an "All-Party Flood Relief Committee"
to ensure corruption-free distribution of relief materials. The
opposition accused the government of failing to deal with the
flood situation and demanded the resignation of the government for
a mid-term election.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition Bangladeshi Nationalist Party even
threatened to have all its lawmakers resign from the parliament to
press for a fresh election under a caretaker government and
opposition leader Khaleda Zia asked the people to get ready for a
massive anti- government movement as soon as the waters recede.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, under such circumstances, had to think
twice before making any decisions, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
As the main concern of the ruling party is to secure support
for itself and maintain its rule, it is easy to understand why
Hasina went to Makkah instead of Durban, they said.

The city completed 1.8 million sq.m. of housing in the first
half of this year, a year-on-year increase of 560,000 square
meters. Housing sales for the period grew by 70 percent to 1.23
million square meters.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin currently resembles a vast construction site, with
cranes rising in every direction and the noises associated with
major projects reverberating throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
Local residents inevitably complain about air and noise
pollution caused by construction, but their eyes nonetheless twinkle
when viewing the numerous advertisements for housing.
</P>
<P>
The preferential policies the city grants to housing developers
has led to an accelerated influx in investments, with housing
funds for the first half of the year hitting 2.85 billion yuan, up
44.6 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong financing represents a major source of investment,
with the total influx thus far approaching three billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 227 new real estate companies were established in the city
in the first five months of this year, bringing the total number
of related ventures to 1,355.
</P>
<P>
A total of 340 intermediate organizations and 1,200 agents have
flourished in the city's real estate sector.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities anticipate that the real estate sector, which
has contributed has over 20 percent of the city's economic growth
over the past four years, will provide yet another major economic
boost during 1998.

<HEADLINE> No Change on Terror Measures, Says UK Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Downing Street on Sunday fiercely
rejected reports that Prime Minister Tony Blair has been forced to
water down the new anti-terrorist legislation going before
parliament when it is recalled on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to some reports a growing backbench revolt has meant
the bill being modified.
</P>
<P>
It has been suggested that the new law enabling people to be
convicted of membership of banned groups on evidence of a senior
police officer will have to be reviewed every year.
</P>
<P>
But a Downing Street spokesman said: "The Prevention of
Terrorism Act is reviewed annually and no one's made the
allegation that the annual review of that act softens it."
</P>
<P>
"The new law may be annually reviewable but it is still
draconian by any stretch of the imagination and is informed by the
RUC and Garda and Irish Government and police in this country," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The draconian new laws against terrorism, announced last week
by Blair while visiting the blast site in Omagh, are expected to
be passed by the parliament on Wednesday when an emergency session
is recalled. In the Omagh explosion two weeks ago, 28 people died
and 220 others injured.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said it had not yet been decided whether the
new law, being passed in response to the devastating Omagh bomb,
would be reviewed annually.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Dam to Play Major Role in Flood Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, Augest 30 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Three Gorges Dam
Project on the Yangtze River will play an increasingly important
role in flood control in the coming years, according to General
Manager Lu Youmei.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the damage and loss of life resulting from this
summer's flooding along the Yangtze River flood would have
been avoided had the dam been operational," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
He said the project contributed to flood control during this
summer's efforts by reducing the flood peak.
</P>
<P>
"The dam will play a major role in flood control by the year
2003 when the water storage capacity during flood season will hit
10 billion cu.m., double the storage capacity of the existing
major Yangtze River flood diversion area," according to Lu.
</P>
<P>
He said the dam's storage capacity will rise even further to 20
billion cu.m. by the year 2007, with the figure rising even
further to 22 billion cu.m. when the project is completed in 2009.
</P>
<P>
"The dam is designed to control a 1000-year flood," said Lu. He
noted the project is proceeding smoothly, with no serious
consequences resulting from summer floods.

<P>
DURBAN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Foreign Minister Gasana
Anastase reiterated here Sunday that his government would reserve
the right to assist the people in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) in their search for a peace solution to the current
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a media briefing in the International Conference
Center, Anastase said while peace and stability in the DRC was
the primary responsibility of the DRC people, the immediate
neighbors of the country should also help them to find a peaceful
solution to the on-going conflict.
</P>
<P>
Stability in DRC will not only benefit the country itself, but
also her neighbors and Rwanda in particular, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anastase is here to participate in Monday's ministerial
meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement Summit.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister criticized Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia
for sending troops to help DRC President Laurent Kabila quell a
rebellion in his country.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that it is out of financial and political
considerations that these three SADC countries are supporting
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the military involvement of certain SADC countries
in the current DRC crisis definitely will not promote a peaceful
resolution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
It serves neither the interest of the Congolese people, nor
that of the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Anastase said Saturday that his country would send troops into
the DRC to rescue Rwandese who are living in the country if the
latest mediation effort led by South African President Nelson
Mandela fails.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Pretoria has been trying to find a
peaceful way to help solve the DRC crisis. Mandela initiated a
small-range SADC summit earlier this month to persuade the
warring parties and their foreign supporters to cease fire and to
start negotiation.

BRUSSELS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The annual Formula One Grand
Prix motor racing was forced on Sunday to re-start at the Belgian
stop at Spa-Francorchamps where championship leader Mika Hakkinen
of Finland bowed out on re-start due a first-bend accident.
</P>
<P>
The multiple collision involving 13 cars that blocked the
track also caused pole's position starter David Coulthard to make
an early exit.
</P>
<P>
The Briton's McLaren spun out of control on the wet track and
the cars behind him were unable to avoid crashing into him.
</P>
<P>
Only two of the 13 drivers who were involved in the accident,
Eddie Ivrine and Rubens Barrichello, got slightly hurt in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Olivier Panis, Ricardo Rosset, Mika Salo and Rubens
Barrichello, however, did not join in the ranks for the second
start-up.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Damon Hill grabbed an early lead after the re-start
by defending champion Michael Schumacher from Germany snatched
back the leader's position after six laps.
</P>
<P>
If Schumacher, who is a wet-track expert and back-to-back winn
er at Spa-Francorchamps from 1995 to 1997, wins on Sunday, he
should have taken the overall leader's position from Hakkinen.
</P>
<P>
The Finn accumulated 77 points for the drivers championship
after the Hungarian Grand Prix race while Schumacher got 70
points.

<HEADLINE> NAM Conference Proceeds Under Tight Security: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The on-going 12th Non-Aligned
Movement conference, which started Saturday, has been proceeding
under tight security, a senior official of the NAM security
services said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, NAM security spokesman Joseph
Ngobeni told Xinhua that everything related to the NAM meeting
security was fine.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this to heavy deployment of police force and
strict security checks around the International Conference Center
where the 6-day NAM meeting is being held.
</P>
<P>
A 1,200-strong security force, consisting of people from the
South African Police Service, the South African National Force
and public security companies, were mobilized and deployed inside
and outside of the meeting center, Ngobeni said.
</P>
<P>
The security services have been performing duties on a 24-hour
basis to ensure that delegates from NAM member states and the
general public involved at the NAM summit are well protected.
</P>
<P>
Referring to security problems during the course of the NAM
conference, Ngobeni admitted that several reports of bomb threats
were received by police, but all proved to be false.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added that several arrests were made Saturday,
noting that none of them was related to the current international
conference.
</P>
<P>
Ngobeni said two people were arrested near the downtown street
after a teargas grenade was found in their car. A further
investigation also led to the arrest of another man, believed to
be owner of the car, for possession of a small quantity of
cocaine and a firearm not belonging to him.
</P>
<P>
In addition, detectives assigned to investigate NAM-related
crimes arrested a suspect Saturday night for stealing a car.

<HEADLINE> Sino-French Cooperation Expected in Financial Computerization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from China and
France expressed hope today for strengthened bilateral cooperation
in the realm of financial computerization.
</P>
<P>
The representatives voiced the hope today during a press
conference sponsored by the organizing committee of the China '98
International Financial Banking Technology and Equipment
Exhibition and the French Embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China is hosting the exhibition which
opened this morning in Beijing. Over 170 domestic and foreign
companies are attending the exhibition, including eight French
companies.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jing, director of the organizing committee and director

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Political Set-Up in Pak Province May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The working relationship
between the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and the ruling Pakistan
Muslim League (N) has finally come to an end after the resignation
of MQM ministers at all levels in Sindh Province.
</P>
<P>
The prickly arrangement in the province between the MQM and PML
(N) had lasted only one and a half years after the general
elections in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
The MQM finally made up its mind to sever its links with the
ruling party on August 26 at all levels and withdrew support from
Sindh Chief Minister Liaquat Ali Jatoi. The decision is reported
to have been endorsed by MQM's chief Altaf Hussain.
</P>
<P>
The decision to walk out of the alliance with the government
was apparently taken after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had said
"no" to the MQM's demand for the release of its workers in the
southern port city of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said some MQM activists were arrested recently in
Karachi and they were accused of having burned the national flag
and mutilated the portrait of the founder of the nation, Muhammad
Ali Jinnah.
</P>
<P>
The PML government is already facing allegations concerning the
release of scores of MQM activists, some with proven criminal
record. Their release in the early phase of the PML (N)
government's tenure is said to have spurred violence in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
The government has learned a bitter lesson, hence it is not
willing to oblige MQM, its alliance partner in the Sindh
government.
</P>
<P>
The MQM cited non-implementation of its accord with the PML (N)
and continued killing of its party activists allegedly by
intelligence agencies and the rival faction of MQM (Haqiqi group),
as the main reasons.
</P>
<P>
"The accord signed with Sharif's ruling PML was not
implemented, none of our demands were met and killing of our
workers and supporters was continuing," MQM Senator Aftab Sheikh
told the media before tendering his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sharif said Friday, however, that MQM quit the
coalition because the government refused to release its activists
allegedly involved in the burning of the national flag in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
"They have done damage to the country by burning the flags,
therefore we will not release them without certain investigation,"
 the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here are of the view that the vendetta between the two
factions of the ethnic party is the main cause of the law and
order problem in the southern port city. According to media
reports, more than 750 people have been killed in revenge killings
this year alone.
</P>
<P>
The MQM which dominates Pakistan's commercial center of Karachi
and other urban areas of southern Sindh Province has said it will
sit on the opposition benches in the parliament but will not join
the main opposition party, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) led
by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, at least for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
With the resignation of MQM ministers from the provincial
government, PPP has now emerged as the largest party in the Sindh
provincial legislature with 35 members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
MQM, earlier named as Mohajir (refugees) Qaumi Movement, joined
the first government led by Benazir in 1988 but pulled out a year
later, charging that PPP did not honor its commitments.
</P>
<P>
Benazir's second government was dismissed in November 1996 on a
host of charges including extra-judicial killings of MQM activists
by her administration in Karachi during her three-year rule.
</P>
<P>
However, political observers have not ruled out the possibility
of the formation of a coalition government in Sindh by MQM and
PPP.
</P>
<P>
"In politics, you keep your options open," The Islamabad-based
major English daily The News quoted the opposition leader as
saying this week.
</P>
<P>
But, some analysts are of the view that there are also
possibilities for the imposition of governor rule in Sindh by the
government to preempt any coalition between PML's arch rival and
its former ally.
</P>
<P>
Benazir has already said the imposition of governor rule, which
stipulates suspension of the provincial legislature and relegation
of all administrative powers to the governor, would be an
unconstitutional act.
</P>
<P>
The pullout of MQM ministers in the provincial assembly has
left Chief Minister Jatoi as the head of a minority government
with only 15 PML (N) members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
"This (MQM resignation) will affect the political set-up in the
Sindh government." the province's governor, Moeenuddin Haider, has
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) Sunday asked the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to
recognize it, according to informed sources here Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that in a six-page letter to South African
President Nelson Mandela, the LTTE asked him to pressure the
Colombo government to seek a negotiated settlement with it.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a war against the Sri Lankan
government since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in the north and
east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE appealed to President Mandela, whose country is to
host the NAM summit this year, to recognize its "aspirations for
national identity and self-determination," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from more than 80 NAM countries including Sri Lanka
began meeting in the South African city of Durban on Saturday
while foreign ministers are due to convene Monday and Tuesday to
prepare for the two-day summit which will begin on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Jonathon Power of Canada
toppled world number one Peter Nicol of Scotland in straight
games to win the 74,000 U.S. dollars Hong Kong Squash Open title
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The left-handed Power who ranked third in the world, savored
his sixth straight victory in the tournament by winning over
Nicol 15-14, 15-11, 15-14.
</P>
<P>
It was a hard win for Power, runner-up in the 1997 Hong Kong
Open, as he edged over his Scottish peer twice on one point, in
the first and third games.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old from Toronto said afterwards he believed he
was ready to steal Nicol's world number one ranking.
</P>
<P>
"I think I definitely had the advantage going in there because
I'd played fewer games," Power said after winning his first major
title since the Qatar International Championship in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very encouraging win for me. I've beaten him six
times in a row now and I feel in my mind that I'm number one ....
I'll have to get a few more wins like this to convince other
people though," Power added.
</P>
<P>
Nicol conceded that he had been unable to win crucial points,
saying that "I just couldn't keep hold of him, every time I tried
to get a point ahead he would get away from me."
</P>
<P>
"It's the crucial points that are the difference -- he seems
to win them and I don't," he said.

BRUSSELS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian Grand Prix was
halted abruptly on the opening lap as the racers bumped each
other for one of the biggest crashes in the Formula One history
in Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But no driver appeared to be seriously injuried in the
accident as David Coulthard who was in third, slammed into the
protective wall and bounced back onto the trace when 22 cars
geared up in the downward section.
</P>
<P>
Coulthard's McLaren-Mercedes was hit by several other drivers
and tires, only 10 cars escaped the crash as the Grand Prix
started in rain after two days of dry conditions.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Irvine was limping slightly and Rubens Barrichello was
holding his arm on the walk back. No other drivers appeared to
have been injured.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time that marred the Belgian Grand Prix with
serious accidents.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, reigning world champion Jacques Villeneuve lost
control of his Williams-Mecachrome on the famed Eau-Rouge corner
and crashed into a protective tire barrier. He was not hurt.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Urges Palestinians to Fight Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Following recent terrorist
attacks against Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday
urged the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
During the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, Netanyahu told
his ministers that there is no intelligent information on any
cooperation between PNA and terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, Israel is continuing to demand the PNA to
fulfill its commitments and curb terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the appeal after the right-wing in his
government asked him to take measures to deal with the terrorist
threats.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, one Israeli settler was stabbed to
death in the West Bank city of Hebron and over 20 Israeli
civilians were wounded in a bombing attack in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The spate of terrorist attacks have dampened cautious optimism
of an imminent agreement between Israel and the Palestinians on
the second redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials blamed the PNA President Yasser Arafat for
failing to condemn the recent attacks.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, in a letter to the United States President
Bill Clinton, Arafat reportedly accused Israel of trying to avoid
agreeing to an American peace initiative, which calls on Israel to
hand over 13 percent of the West Bank in the second withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also urged that more pressure be put on Israel to accept
the plan.

<HEADLINE> Russian Accord of Political Compromise Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia's political leaders Sunday
signed a comprising agreement to redistribute political power
among the president, parliament and government in a bid to defuse
mounting political tension in the country.
</P>
<P>
The accord, reached by the Kremlin, the government and both
chambers of parliament at a meeting held in the State Duma,
provides for a mutual non-aggression pact, the creation within a
month of a commission to revise the Constitution, and the adoption
of a strategy to fight economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft accord, which has yet to be signed by President
Boris Yeltsin, the president shall not dissolve the State Duma
(lower house of parliament) before elections in 1999, and the Duma
shall not urge the cabinet's resignation during the period.
</P>
<P>
The accord marked a major compromise among all sides in the
wake of worsening economic crisis and political uncertainty
following the abrupt dismissal of the four-month-old cabinet of
Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was sacked just five months ago, was
named acting prime minister last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Kiriyenko cabinet was ousted in the aftermath of an
effective devaluation of the ruble and a de facto default of
Russia's foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
The decision on August 17, made by Kiriyenko and the Central
Bank to raise the ceiling of the ruble's exchange corridor from
6.3 to 9.5 rubles against the U.S. dollar, and a 90-day moratorium
on repayments of foreign debts, sent the securities markets diving
to record lows.
</P>
<P>
The ruble, which continued spiraling despite Chernomyrdin's
return, shed more than 40 percent in two weeks as Russians rushed
to banks to withdraw their life savings.
</P>
<P>
At some exchange points in Moscow, the ruble dropped to 12
rubles against the dollar. However, the national currency
rebounded somewhat to around 9 rubles to the dollar following
Yeltsin's assertion Friday night that he would not step down as
rumored.
</P>
<P>
Prices soared, especially for imported commodities such as
high-end electronics and food products.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous financial turbulence that barely touched the
life of ordinary people, most are feeling the pinch of the latest
financial chaos as over half of foodstuff sold in Russia were
imported.
</P>
<P>
However, Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's representative in the
Duma, said it was too early to talk about the future of the draft
document, although "a foundation for accord has been laid and
mutual concession have been made," the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
It would be premature to say that the draft document has set
political reform in motion, Kotenkov said, noting that Yeltsin now
has the final say.
</P>
<P>
The document, drafted by the legislative and executive
branches, has been submitted to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The left opposition parties will meet on Monday over the
agreement, which could pave the way for the State Duma to confirm
Chernomyrdin's nomination as prime minister on the same day.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian constitution, if the State Duma
rejects the nomination of prime minister for three times, the
president would have to either nominate a new prime minister or
dissolve the Duma.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's draft political accord was seen as an attempt to
avert such a scenario and ensure a speedy confirmation of
Chernomyrdin as prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Urged to Be Responsible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Sunday appealed to Malaysians to face the reality
that they have to be responsible in defending and managing their
own country.
</P>
<P>
In his national day address to the nation telecast live over
Radio and Television Malaysia on the eve of the national day which
falls on August 31, Mahathir said Malaysia should never depend on
foreign assistance to overcome the current economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said, "We must strive on our own to revive our
nation's economy and defend our sovereignty and independence."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also called on the people to continue maintaining
racial harmony and political stability in the country to ensure
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also said the people should understand the factors and
pressures resulting from the economic downturn so that they could
take appropriate actions to overcome them.
</P>
<P>
"The government's aim is nothing more than to revive the
economy and to restore the dignity of the race and the nation,"
Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia could most likely revive its economy if the
program of the National Economic Action Council, which has
prepared a complete guideline to reactivate the various fields
systematically, could be fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
The current economic problem has forced the government to
revise the country's growth rate to a contraction of 1 percent or
more for this year compared with an 8-percent growth for more than
10 consecutive years previously, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said attempts to destroy Malaysia's economy through
speculative attacks on the currency and the stock market and
efforts to undermine the nation through so-called market forces,
allegedly to discipline the government, almost succeeded in
causing catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
"Outsiders never wish to see Malaysia recover by continuously
attacking the country's currency and the stock market whenever the
government initiates measures to revive the nation's economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia has resisted all such attempts because the
country's development is based on its own efforts, finances and
system and policies without having to bear the burden of paying
huge foreign debts.

<HEADLINE> China Wins Thai Leg in Volleyball Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China recorded an impressive
3-1 win over Russia to take the Thailand leg of the women's
volleyball Grand Prix here Sunday, the third and last day
competition.
</P>
<P>
Prior to their head-to-head, both China and Russia recorded
two straight wins over Italy and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In their decisive round-robin match, the Russians got off to a
good start against the Chinese and won the first set surprisingly
by 15-5 thanks to their obvious superiority in height.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese, who downed the United States 3-0 and Italy
3-1 in their earlier two meets, stormed back to take the
following three sets in a row with superb spikes from Sun Yue and
Wang Lina.
</P>
<P>
In the second and third sets, the Chinese spikers showed their
top-notched class to beat the Russians 15-7 and 15-10.
</P>
<P>
The fourth set was closely fought but the Chinese eventually
triumphed 15-12.
</P>
<P>
In another match, the Italians displayed their impressive
strength by beating the United States 3-1.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first set 7-15, the Americans hit back to
take the second by 15-13 but failed to stop the Italians from
winning two hard-fought sets 15-13 and 17-15.
</P>
<P>
The Russians, who won the Macau leg earlier, finished second
with two wins against one loss, while Italy edged over the United
States for the third spot as the winless Americans tailed in the
four-member Thailand tournament.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Oil Industry in Critical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Oil production and export
systems in Iraq are in critical conditions due to the delayed
arrival of spare parts and production requirements for oil
installations, said an Iraqi Oil Ministry source.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency on Sunday, the
unnamed source said without spare parts, it is hard for Iraq to
repair any accidental failure now.
</P>
<P>
So far Iraq has signed 111 contracts valued at 100 million
U.S. dollars to purchase oil spare parts, but the U.N. Sanctions
Committee has approved only seven and put on hold five others,
said the source.
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of U.N. oil experts dispatched to Iraq in
mid-April to assess Iraq's production and export capacities, the
U.N. Security Council allows Iraq to import 300 million dollars
worth of spare parts for its oil sector under the fourth phase of
the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of the current fourth phase of the
oil-for-food deal, which came into force on June 3, Iraq has
exported more than 125 million barrels of crude under 57
contracts, the source said.
</P>
<P>
For the past three phases of the oil-for-food deal, the source
estimated that the total value of actual deliveries of spare parts
and oil sector requirements that arrived in Iraq at about 2.5
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the current phase of oil-for-food deal, Iraq is
allowed to import 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil to
buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed the crippling sanctions upon Iraq in 1990
after its invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Lauds Women's Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, the voice of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), hailed the Eighth National Chinese
Women's Congress to be held tomorrow as "a major event in the
political life of the Chinese women."
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow's edition of the paper will carry an editorial of
congratulations on the opening of the congress.
</P>
<P>
"The congress is an important meeting being held at a crucial
period in China's reform, opening and the construction of
socialist modernization," according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the congress will undoubtedly mobilize tens of
millions of Chinese women to uphold the great banner of Deng
Xiaoping Theory, implement the spirit of the 15th National
Congress of CPC and help propel the nation's socialist cause into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Seventh National Chinese Women's Congress was held five
years ago and the great majority of the Chinese women under the
leadership of the Central Committee of CPC with Jiang Zemin at the
core have since made huge contributions to the reform, opening and
socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that Chinese women have fully
displayed the spirit of "self-respect, self-confidence,
self-reliance and self-improvement".
</P>
<P>
The Daily calls on women's organizations at all levels to play
a special role in the eradication of poverty and illiteracy, while
at the same time working to ensure the reemployment of laid-off
workers.
</P>
<P>
"The Party and the government have always recognized the highly
important role Chinese women have played in the past and will
continue to play," according to editorial." It adds that the Party
and people cherish great hope that Chinese women will play an
exemplary role in reform, opening and socialist modernization."
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Jiang Zemin has consistently pointed out that women
have played a great role in creating human civilization and
promoting social development," says the Daily.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that "respecting and protecting women
represents an important landmark in social progress, and should be
the norms of the law and moral practices of a civilized society."
</P>
<P>
However, according to the Daily, indifferences and prejudice
against women continue to exist in reality.
</P>
<P>
"The Party and society as a whole must take a firm stand and
strictly adhere to the Marxist theory on women and resolutely
implement the policies of the equality of men and women.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Accuses Cypriot, Greek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash has warned that the recent Cyprus-Greece joint statement
on the deployment of Russian-made S-300 missiles in Cyrus could
raise tension on this Eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on a summit meeting between Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides and Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis, held in Athens on Thursday, according to Turkish Cypriot
newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Denktash described the joint statement issued after the
meeting in Athens as "attempting to camouflage Cyprus and
Greece's continuing dangerous adventurist stance in the region."
</P>
<P>
He accused the Greek Cypriots and Greece of being responsible
for the escalating tension in Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
In the Cyprus-Greece joint communique, Clerides and Simitis
said the missiles would be deployed as planned and that Greece
would back Cyprus militarily in the event of any strike by Turkey
against their deployment.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders stressed that they did not want tension which
would lead to confrontation, and that the missiles constitute a
threat only to those who dare attack.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey's Foreign Ministry announced Saturday that
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem will pay a visit to the
Turkish Cypriot-controlled northern Cyprus on Monday, during which
Cem will hold talks with Denktash and other officials.
</P>
<P>
Turkey did not reveal the real purpose of Cem's previously
unscheduled visit, which comes following Thursday's talks between
Clerides and Simitis.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus contracted to buy anti-aircraft S-300 missile systems
from Russia in January 1997. The missiles are reportedly scheduled
to be delivered and deployed in November this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has strongly opposed the deal and threatened military
strikes against the missiles if deployed. The U.S. and Britain
have also criticized Cyprus for aggravating the tensions.
</P>
<P>
But the Cypriot government has offered to cancel the deal if
Turkey accepts proposal for demilitarization of the island, or if
there is substantial progress in the U.N.-sponsored talks for
the reunification of the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops landed and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", recognized only by
Ankara.

Colombian won the bout eventually.
</P>
<P>
The IBF ruled that Murillo would be declared champion if he
won while Pastrana would be allowed to try and regain the crown
if he were victorious.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana, now unbeaten in 19 fights, stopped his opponent
after nine of 12 rounds. Murillo's record is now 37-6.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time the 25-year-old had been stripped of
the title. He won it against American Michael Carbajal on points
in January 1997 in Las Vegas only to lose it four months later
for failing to appear for the weigh-in before fighting Dominican
Manuel Herrera.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana reclaimed the title at the end of the same year by
knocking out Herrera.

<HEADLINE> Kotenkov: Yeltsin Has Final Say on Draft Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 30 (Xinhua) -- An agreement designed to
redistribute Russia's political power among the president,
parliament and government was signed here Sunday by all the
participants at a meeting held in the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
The accord, reached by the Kremlin, the government and both
chambers of parliament, provides for a mutual non-aggression pact,
the creation within a month of a commission to revise the
Constitution and the adoption of a strategy to fight economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft accord, which has yet to be signed by President
Boris Yeltsin, the president shall not dissolve the State Duma
(lower house of parliament) before elections in 1999, and the Duma
shall not urge the cabinet's resignation during the period.
</P>
<P>
The accord marked a major compromise among all sides in the
wake of worsening economic crisis and political uncertainty
following the abrupt dismissal of the four-month-old cabinet of
Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was sacked just five months ago, was
named acting prime minister last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's representative in the
Duma, said it was too early to talk about the future of the draft
document, although "a foundation for accord has been laid and
mutual concession has been made," the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
It would be premature to say that the draft document has set
political reform in motion, Kotenkov said, noting that Yeltsin now
has the final say.
</P>
<P>
The document, drafted by the legislative and executive
branches, has been submitted to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The left opposition parties will meet on Monday over the
agreement, which could pave the way for the State Duma to confirm
Chernomyrdin's nomination as prime minister on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin will also participate in the meeting, said
Alexander Shokhin, head of the Our Home is Russia faction.

TEHRAN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Sunday appointed Mohammad Ali Sadooqi as vice
president for legal and parliamentary affairs to replace

<HEADLINE> Indian Vice-President Proposes Rejection Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Indian Vice-President Krishan
Kant Sunday suggested introducing a "rejection vote" in the
elections and making it mandatory for a candidate to secure more
than 50 percent of votes polled to get elected.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the convocation address at the National Law School
of India University, he said the rejection vote proposal would
force political parties to adopt agendas that unite instead of
dividing.
</P>
<P>
The rejection vote has the potential to bring about a
qualitative transformation in the policy and values of society, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian society and policy are fractured into castes and
sub-castes, regions and sub-regions, ethnicity and sub-ethnicity
and harmonizing instruments are getting marginalized, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Competitive politics have sidelined the crying need for
reconciling the diversities of society and a party could win or a
candidate could get elected on the basis of a minority of the
votes cast in her or his favor, he further said.
</P>
<P>
Making securing of a minimum of 50 percent of votes cast
mandatory would force political parties to adopt candidates who
have the ability to unite rather than divide and field the best of
the people as candidates, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bank Calls Productivity Key to HK Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A report just released by the
Standard Chartered Bank said Hong Kong should devote more thought
to enhancing productivity in order to further enhance
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The report said talk about Hong Kong's lack of competitiveness
because of high costs and a strong currency is "misplaced."
</P>
<P>
The export performance of both Hong Kong and the Chinese
mainland has actually been "much better than many people believe,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Drastic depreciation of the Southeast Asian currencies has not
enhanced the competitiveness of the countries concerned, but
destroyed financial stability and wiped out companies and banks,
the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong's success has been built on its ability to
offer quality trade and other services, a threat to Hong Kong's
competitiveness is seen by the report as the "lack of a sense of
urgency amongst some sectors of the local community about the need
to reform and to take a more critical look at how to adjust to
rapid economic and industrial changes."
</P>
<P>
The report urged the government to step up its efforts to
reform the public sector, so that Hong Kong could stand up to the
challenges of a rapidly changing world.

ANKARA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi Kurdish faction has
killed 15 members of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) in a recent military operation in northern Iraq, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a radio report by Iraq's Kurdish Democratic
Party (KDP) as saying that the KDP forces launched attacks against
PKK rebels over the past few days, who were trying to set up camps
in the border areas of northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Many other PKK members were wounded in the armed clashes in
Gusin mountain in northern Iraq, the report said, without giving
details.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey
since 1984, while Turkish troops launch frequent attacks upon it.
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 PKK members have been taking shelters in northern
Iraq since Baghdad was rendered ineffective in controlling the
area in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The KDP has been cooperating with Turkish troops in uprooting
the PKK, which uses northern Iraq as a springboard for attacks
against Turkish targets across the border.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Calls for Europe's Understanding of Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin called on European countries to show
understanding of Russia's current difficulties and not to demand
the impossible from it, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag
Saturday evening, Chernomyrdin said, "There will be no collapse of
Russia."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the problem is the time and ways and
decisions to be made to pull the country's economy out of crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin singled out the countrymen's lower confidence in
actions taken by the authorities, executive or legislative, as
Russia's most difficult problem.
</P>
<P>
This mistrust is generated, above all, from the state's failure
to pay the populace their wages and pensions, which have
considerably increased over the past six months, now in particular
because of price hikes.
</P>
<P>
The main thing is to stabilize the situation and put it back to
a normal and stable channel, the acting prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
As for the West's responsibility for Russia's reform,
Chernomyrdin noted that many politicians in the West displayed
skepticism and passiveness with respect to the West's political
and economic relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
But "this kind of skepticism and passiveness often results in
the fact that support from the West, which is necessary for
Russia's reform, is belated."
</P>
<P>
"Not only loans are needed; joint economic projects are also
necessary. In particular, I think Russia should participate in the
Euro project," Chernomyrdin stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said here that he would make "great efforts" to
advance the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese reporters on the eve of his
upcoming visit to China, Mordechai said that he is "seeking for
every possible way" to break the current deadlock in the peace
talks in order to maintain the stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that China will continue to play a
positive role in the peace process and help Israel and its
neighbor Arab countries achieve peace.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel is ready to return territories to the
Palestinians but on condition that the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) fulfill its commitments to fight terrorism and
assure the security interests of the Jewish country.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai hoped that Israel and the PNA would reach an
agreement over the second withdrawal by the end of next month,
noting that there is desire for peace from both sides as well as
the mediation of the United States.
</P>
<P>
When an agreement is reached, Israel and the PNA would begin
the final status talks to tackle more sensitive issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the tense situation in south Lebanon, Mordechai
said that Israel stations its troops in the area just for
preventing its northern borders from being attacked by anti-Israel
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
He noted that on April 1 this year, the Israeli Cabinet
accepted the U.N. Resolution 425 and expressed willingness to pull
out its troops from Lebanon after reaching a security agreement
with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which has great influence on Lebanon, have
turned down the Israeli offer, saying the withdrawal must be
unconditional to keep in line with the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said the Lebanese people also want to
achieve peace with Israel and he will make efforts to bring about
an agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai is scheduled to leave for China on Sunday for a
five-day official visit. He will be accompanied by a 45-member
delegation, including senior officials, businessmen and
journalists.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that his visit will promote mutual
understanding and enhance cooperation between Israel and China.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that he is willing to share Israel's information
and experience in high technology field with China.

<HEADLINE> European Satellite Launched from Baikonur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 30 (Xinhua) -- An Astra-2A satellite of the
Societe Eureopeenne des Satellites (Luxembourg) was launched from
the Baikonur cosmodrome to a geostationary orbit on Sunday
morning at 4:29 Moscow time, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces, the launch
was carried out under the SES's contract with the International
Launch Services, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin Corp. of
the United States, and Russia's Khrunichev center and RSC Energia.
</P>
<P>
The satellite was made by Hughes, an American company, and is
intended for individual TV broadcasts to Europe.
</P>
<P>
It is said that An Astra-2A is the eighth satellite in the
Astra series. The first five Astra's were put into orbit by
Arian-4 French boosters and two by Proton-K's from the Baikonur
cosmodrome in April 1996 and in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Khrunichev is to launch five satellites of
this series.
</P>
<P>
Khrunichev experts said that SES had refused to use an
improved booster manufactured by RSC Energia because a
temperature increase had been registered on the wall of the
turbine's gas manifold, and demanded that a new booster be
provided for the launch.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the next satellite of this series,
Astra-1H, is to be launched next year.
</P>
<P>
SES, founded in 1985, was the first private company to appear
on the European market of individual satellite TV broadcasting.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army Sunday lifted
a 10-day curfew imposed on the Israeli-controlled areas in the
West Bank town of Hebron, enabling 20,000 Palestinians with work
permits in Israel to return to their works, Israel Radio reported.
</P>

There have been sporadic clashes between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinians since the Israeli army imposed the curfew on the
night of August 20 after a Jewish rabbi was stabbed to death in
his home.

Hebron, home to about 120,000 Palestinians and more than 400
Jewish settlers, has become one of the flash points between the
two sides since it was divided into two areas separately
controlled by Israel and the Palestinians under an interim
agreement signed early last year.

<HEADLINE> Floods to Continue for two More Weeks in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The nearly two-month-long floods
in Bangladesh may continue for two more weeks in any form, the New
Nation newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Any significant change in the overall flood situation during
the period will depend on the tidal effects in the Bay of Bengal
and quantum of rainfall in the uptream areas of the country's four
major river basins, The English daily quoted experts at the Flood
Forecasting and Warning Center saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the flood situation in seven districts further
aggravated on Saturday following heavy rainfall in the Brahmaputra
and south-eastern hill basins and light-to-moderate rainfall in
the Ganges and Meghna basins.
</P>
<P>
The situation, however, remained unchanged in 17 districts and
marked slight improvement in six others.
</P>
<P>
The floods, which started in early July, have hit 45 out of the
country's 64 districts, with about 400 people dead and over 20.4
million people affected in the country.
</P>
<P>
Over 214,000 hectares of crops and about 354,420 houses have
been washed away or damaged by the floods, according to the Relief
Control Room.
</P>
<P>
The floods have also wrecked 3,977 km of embankments, 9,185 km
of roads, and many bridges and culverts, and damaged as many as
10,000 educational institutions.
</P>
<P>
The government has so far distributed around 40 million taka
(850,000 U.S. dollars) in cash, nearly 60,000 tons of rice and
other relief materials among the flood-hit people.
</P>
<P>
The immediate material and infrastructural losses due to the
floods have been estimated at around 2.5 billion taka (53.2
million dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, unofficial sources put the losses at between 220-300
billion taka (4.68-6.38 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government has appealed to donors for assistance, and got
positive response from them. Donors such as The United States,
Britain, Canada, Japan and Australia have provided or agreed to
provide aid to the country.
</P>
<P>
A team from the United Nations is scheduled to come shortly to
assess the needs in the light of the devastating floods.

<HEADLINE> Karl Named as NBA Bucks Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- George Karl, who was fired
by Seattle SuperSonics three months ago despite enormous success,
was named as the head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks today.
</P>
<P>
Karl was introduced at a news confrence by Bucks and was given
a four-year contract, which is worth 20 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He replaced Chris Ford, who was fired three days ago. In two
seasons, Ford was unable to secure a playoff berth for the
Bucks,who now have had five coaches since their last postseason
berth in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Karl was fired May 26 after seven seasons as coach of the
SuperSonics. He had a 384-150 mark with Seattle but absorbed a
pair of embarrassing first round playoff losses and often clashed
with management over his support of players.
</P>
<P>
However, he never missed the postseason and guided the Sonics
to the 1996 NBA Finals, where they lost to the Chicago Bulls in
six games.
</P>
<P>
"When the opportunity here came about, I was very excited," he
said. "I love coaching and I wanted to coach this season more th
an sit out and wait."
</P>
<P>
The Sonics fired Karl two weeks after they were eliminated by
the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference semi-finals in
five games. He was upset that management did not offer him an
extension during the season, which ended in Seattle's third
straight Pacific Division title.
</P>
<P>
He made more than 3 million U.S. dollars in the 1997-98 season
and was replaced by former Phoenix Suns coach Paul Westphal.

<HEADLINE> Dropsy Claims 23 Lives in Indian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 23 people have died
and more than 200 others have been admitted to hospitals in New
Delhi after using adulterated mustard oil, official sources said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But unofficial reports put the death toll at more than 30 and
said the total number of patients suffering from dropsy since the
first case was reported on August 5 has exceeded 1,100.
</P>
<P>
Far from receding, the outbreak of dropsy seems to be spreading
to more areas with fresh cases being reported from South and East
Delhi Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Local governments of the capital city and many Indian states
have issued notices to ban the sale of mustard oil, the main
culprit for dropsy.
</P>
<P>
A city court has issued notices to the authorities concerned
seeking a ban on all adulterated food items in the capital, and
issued non-bailable warrants against 13 traders on charges of
selling adulterated mustard oil.
</P>
<P>
Delhi Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has said that officials of
Prevention of Food Adulteration Department had been told to file
complaints against the seven major manufacturers of mustard oil
whose samples had tested positive to adulteration by next Monday
even if they had not completed their investigations.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Hold Federal Election on October 3: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard announced on Sunday that a federal election will be held on
October 3.
</P>
<P>
"This morning I called on His Excellency the Governor-General
(William Deane) and recommended to him that the parliament should
be prorogued, the House of Representatives dissolved and an
election held on the third of October," Howard told a press
conference in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
"His Excellency has accepted my advice and an election will be
held on October 3."
</P>
<P>
A federal election could have been called as late as May, 1999.
But under the Australian Constitution, the governor-general may
dissolve the House of Representatives for a federal election on
the advice of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"The main issue in this election campaign will be one of
economic competence," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Howard listed the achievements the ruling Australian Liberal
Party and National Party Coalition made during the past two years
and five months, and blasted the main opposition labor party and
their policies.
</P>
<P>
"I am very proud of the record of economic and other
achievement of the government that I lead," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would turn a deficit inherited from his
predecessor Paul Keating of 10.5 billion Australian dollars (5.5
billion U.S. dollars) into a surplus this financial year.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the government had delivered 300,000 new jobs,
maintained the social security safety net and modernized
industrial relations.
</P>
<P>
He also described the legislation on native title, or amendment
to laws on aborigines' land claim rights, as a major achievement.
</P>
<P>
"We resolved the native title impasse, probably one of the most
difficult issues ever to confront any modern government, despite
the negative opportunism and the obstruction of the Australian
Labor Party from start to finish," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister urged voters to support the tax reform plan
unveiled on August 13, and reject the tax reform plan unveiled by
the labor party last week.
</P>
<P>
"We have a plan that says to the Australian people we must
seize the moment to reform this increasingly unworkable (taxation)
system. We must confront the need to have reform as well as
relief."
</P>
<P>
The Howard government's plan, which aims to reform the nation's
70 year-old taxation system with tax cuts to
lower-and-middle-income families totaling 7 billion U.S. dollars,
has been widely welcomed, particularly by business groups.
</P>
<P>
The government's approval rate has improved slightly,
surpassing that of the labor party since then.
</P>
<P>
The labor party also unveiled its own tax reform agenda last
week, which was described by Australian business groups as
short-sighted.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe the timing of the election could not be better
for the Howard government as its approval rate exceeds the labor
party.
</P>
<P>
It is also feared that as time passes by, the effect of the
Asian economic crisis will be greater, reducing the government's
electoral support.
</P>
<P>
Many economists predict the nation's economic growth would
further slow down, or even into a recession while the jobless
rate, which stands at 8.7 percent, will go up as the Asian
economic crisis bites deeper into Australia's economy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, an early election will leave little time for the
labor party to sell its tax plan and attack the government's tax
reform program.

BEIJING -- The China's stock market started a downward trend
last week despite strong rebounding the week before as a combined
result of declining company performance, volatile neighboring
markets, and severe flooding.
</P>
<P>
The unsatisfying company performance revealed in interim
reports has been the basic factor behind the sluggish market,
which made it unlikely for the market to ride on a rising trend in
the near future, according to a stock analyst with the Hubei
Securities Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark index on Shanghai and Shenzhen markets plunged to
1,129.72 points and 3,212 points last Friday, down 65.69 and 190
points from the week before, respectively. Stock turnover
continued to shrink, to 3.08 billion yuan 2.8 billion yuan,
respectively, last Friday.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 percent of the listed companies have complained
about the impact the Asian Financial Crisis has had on their
businesses in interim reports, covering a wide range of sectors
such as transportation, electronics, real estate, light
industries, machinery, foreign trade, agriculture and metallurgy.

BEIJING -- A senior Chinese economist said that rumors about
the possible devaluation of the RMB yuan are intentionally
fostered by certain international fund companies seeking quick
profits.
</P>
<P>
The rumors have escalated recently in a wake of the sharp
devaluation of the Japanese yen, despite the Chinese Government's
expression of confidence and determination to keep the yuan
stable, China Daily (Business Weekly) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Black market traders have also been spreading the rumors,
thinking it is time to make big money, it said.

WASHINGTON -- The United States said Saturday it was encouraged
by acting Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's quick
reassurances about his country's crumbling economy.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, re-appointed by President Boris Yeltsin this
week, earlier Saturday ruled out any return to Russia's Soviet
past and also assembled a group of senior reformers to prepare
urgent measures to halt the country's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to comment at this point until they have a
government, they formally have their economic team and they
formally lay out their economic program, but certainly it is
encouraging," said P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the president's
national security council. (US-Russia-Economy)

<P>
CARACAS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan basket of crudes
and byproducts closed with an average price of 9.96 dollars per
barrel this week, a 13-cent rise over the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The Energy and Mines Ministry's weekly statistics show that the
average quotation of crudes was up to 11.09 dollars per barrel
Friday, still lower than the target for the nation's 1998 budget
of 11.50 dollars by the end of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan basket price rose by 0.40 dollars from Tuesday
to Thursday in what is seen as a positive answer to the agreement
between independent producers and member countries of OPEC on
voluntary cuts of crude production, according to Energy and Mines
Minister Erwin Arrieta.
</P>
<P>
OPEC cut crude output by 2.6 million barrels a day from July 1
this year to June 30 of 1999. Venezuela has announced a cut of
525,000 barrels a day.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Ruling Coalition Urges Fair Trial of Ex-Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Albania's ruling coalition
parties have called for faster and more transparent procedures of
the trial of six former government officials as more social unrest
is looming large in the country.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the government to ensure a professional
international supervision over the trial, according to a statement
issued on Saturday after a late-night meeting by the five
coalition parties led by the Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
On August 22, prosecutors ordered the arrest of six senior
officials of the former Democratic Party government on charges of
crimes against humanity for their alleged role in the violent
insurgency early last year, in which some 2,000 people died.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party, in defiance of a police ban, has held
rallies and marches demanding the immediate release of the six
defendants including former Defense Minister Safet Zhulali, former
deputy chief of the secret service Bujar Rama and former Interior
Minister Halit Shamata.
</P>
<P>
Several people were reportedly injured in clashes between
police and protesters as the Democratic Party threatened to topple
the government, sparking concerns for a possible recurrence of
turmoil in the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the ruling coalition parties accused the
opposition of politicizing the judicial procedures, stressing that
Albania has embarked on the road to separate judiciary from
administration and any efforts to revert the process would lead to
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
The coalition condemned leaders of the Democratic Party for
making unlawful statements seeking to drag the country into chaos
once more by exploiting the arrests of the six former officials.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the office of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe and office of the Council of Europe
stationed in Albania also urged all the parties not to politicize
the trial of the six former officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 29 (Xinhua) -- An executive of South
Korea's LG Electronics reported missing for five days in Panama
was found Saturday, police said.
</P>
<P>
Sun Hak Park, 36, the company's marketing manager for Latin
America, arrived at his home in the city early Saturday, police
chief Jose Luis Sossa was quoted by the AFP as saying.
</P>
<P>
Park was found "safe and sound after spending several days on an
unscheduled vacation," Sossa said.
</P>
<P>
The company's general manager J. J. Lee had confirmed to the
Panamanian technical judicial police that Park disappeared Tuesday
morning and had not reported himself to the company.
</P>
<P>
Park has worked 10 years for LG Electronics and has been
stationing in Panama for four years with his wife and children.

His missing has caused alarm because about two weeks ago
another businessman, Hans Jorg Bosch of the UBS Panama Swiss Bank
manager, was reported missing in the capital.

<HEADLINE> Panamanian President Expects Positive Result of Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian President Ernesto
Perez Balladares predicted that the result of Sunday's referendum
will favor the reform of the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The reform would eliminate the restriction that does not allow
the President to be reelected to another five-year term unless he
sits out two terms.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the reform said the permission of immediate
presidential reelection will assure smooth handover of the Panama
Canal and U.S. military land scheduled for December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
If the reform is approved in the referendum, Perez Balladares,
who came into office in September 1993, would be very likely to
get reelected in May next year, according to political analysts.
</P>
<P>
However, the critics against the reform hold that such reform
would bring back dictatorship to the country.
</P>
<P>
According to an Electoral Court decree, the parties of panama
closed Friday night the campaign for the referendum.

<HEADLINE> More than 10,000 Turn Out for Opposition Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 people took
part in an opposition demonstration Sunday at Phnom Penh Olympic
Stadium without the permission of the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators mostly from outside Phnom Penh and other
provinces gathered at the stadium and marched to the National
Assembly along main roads to join a mass sit-in before the
Assembly which had entered the seventh days. Many stores have to
be closed for security concern.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two main opposition parties, Sam Rainsy and
Funcinpec Parties, led the march. Many people held placards
reading "Down With Hun Sen!" "We want democracy!" "America is the
only hope for Cambodian people!" "USA and U.N. have to find
justice for Cambodia!" alongside slogans against Vietnam and the
Cambodian People's Party (CCP).
</P>
<P>
The government so far had not taken any measures to stop the
demonstration, but the large scale opposition activities caused
many people to worry about the stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
The CPP won the most seats for the new parliament in last
month's election, giving it the right to form a government.
However, the party is far short of the two-thirds majority needed
to confirm the government.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec Party led by Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy Party
(SRP) have so far balked at joining a coalition, insisting that
the CPP first dump powerful Second Prime Minister Hun Sen as its
prime ministerial candidate.
</P>
<P>
But if the CPP were able to change the Constitution, it could
use its majority in the upcoming parliament -- still disputed by
the opposition as being the result of an illegal seat-allocation
formula -- to form a government without Funcinpec.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that it was unlikely the CPP could persuade
enough members of the 120-member Assembly to attend a lame-duck
session. Internal rules of the parliament require 84 lawmakers to
form a quorum.

<HEADLINE> Security Tightened at U.S. Sites in Italy, Says Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Security has been tightened at
U.S. sites in Italy in the wake of this month's bomb attacks on
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and subsequent reprisals by
Washington, Italian Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with La Repubblica daily, Napolitano said, "the
forces of the Italian state have taken all possible measures to
protect American targets from possible terrorist acts."
</P>
<P>
Napolitano stressed the importance of preventing the spread of
terrorism and warned of a possible increase in the activities of
Islamist terrorists in Italy.
</P>
<P>
"The systematic prevention of terrorism counts much more than
reprisals," he said, "We must be on our guard in Italy because the
activity of extremist groups could become more dangerous."
</P>
<P>
He said cooperation between Italy and the United States in this
field was "recognized by both sides as excellent."
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned against appearing to target Islam in
combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The most serious mistake of Western governments would be to
identify Islam with terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
Napolitano stressed that Italy's own Islamic community was
firmly against terrorism. "We are only faced with small nuclei
which have been identified and subjected to judicial
procedures... But we must be very vigilant," he said.
</P>
<P>
Italian police have launched a series of operations against
suspected Islamist terror groups in the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Speculators Cautioned over RMB Rumor Mill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese economist said
that rumors about the possible devaluation of the RMB yuan are
intentionally fostered by certain international fund companies
seeking quick profits.
</P>
<P>
The rumors have escalated recently in a wake of the sharp
devaluation of the Japanese yen, despite the Chinese Government's
expression of confidence and determination to keep the renminbi
stable, China Daily (Business Weekly) said today.
</P>
<P>
Black market traders have also been spreading the rumors,
thinking it is time to make big money, it said.
</P>
<P>
"These fund companies are liars with an axe to grind," Li
Guobin, a senior economist with the State Information Center, was
quoted as saying by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In order to make their rumors sound reasonable, they
exaggerated the impact of the Asian financial crisis and the
devaluation of the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
They also predicted that China's policy to stimulate domestic
demand will not pay off and the eight percent economic growth
target will not be fulfilled, it said.
</P>
<P>
"It is believed that overseas liars could create more
sensational rumors in the future to further their sinister
intentions of speculation," the economist said.
</P>
<P>
Li said these rumors disregard the simplest economic rule,
according to which the exchange rate of a currency is decided by
the relation between its supply and demand.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Hold Federal Election on October 3: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard on Sunday called a federal election for October 3.
</P>
<P>
"This morning I called on His Excellency the Governor-General
(William Deane) and recommended to him that the parliament should
be prorogued, the House of Representatives dissolved and an
election held on the third of October," Howard told a press
conference in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
"His Excellency has accepted my advice and an election will be
held on October 3."
</P>
<P>
Under the Australian Constitution, the governor-general may
dissolve the House of Representatives for a federal election on
the advice of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Howard's meeting with the governor-general follows weeks of
speculation about an election. The Howard government had until
next May to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
"The main issue in this election campaign will be one of
economic competence," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister listed the achievements the ruling
Australian Liberal Party and National Party Coalition made during
the past two years and five months, and blasted the Australian
Labor Party, the leading opposition party, and its policies.
</P>
<P>
"The main issue will be whether the coalition or Labor Party at
a time of economic uncertainty, even turmoil in some parts of the
world, whether the coalition or the Labor Party should be placed
at the helm of economic management in Australia."
</P>
<P>
Howard said the current state of the world economy reinforced
the need for Australia's economic foundations to be as strong as
possible, adding that his government had restored the strength of
Australia's economic foundations.

<HEADLINE> Poor Company Performance Pulls Down China's Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The China's stock market
started a downward trend last week despite strong rebounding the
week before as a combined result of declining company performance,
volatile neighboring markets, and severe flooding.
</P>
<P>
The unsatisfying company performance revealed in interim
reports has been the basic factor behind the sluggish market,
which made it unlikely for the market to ride on a rising trend
in the near future, according to a stock analyst with the Hubei
Securities Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark index on Shanghai and Shenzhen markets plunged to
1,129.72 points and 3,212 points last Friday, down 65.69 and 190
points from the week before, respectively. Stock turnover
continued to shrink, to 3.08 billion yuan 2.8 billion yuan,
respectively, last Friday.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 percent of the listed companies have complained
about the impact the Asian Financial Crisis has had on their
businesses in interim reports, covering a wide range of sectors
such as transportation, electronics, real estate, light
industries, machinery, foreign trade, agriculture and metallurgy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 555 listed companies, or 70.34 percent of
the total have reported sliding per unit yield by August 28, with
436 such companies, or 55.26 percent having shrinking net profits
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
All the listed companies are required to finish publicizing
their interim reports by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
The weak market fundamentals, or the national economy, is
mainly to blame for the bearish market, according to Chen Jinling,
a stock analyst with the Guotai Securities Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The weak domestic consumption demand has had direct impact on
the company performance, resulting in an increasing number in
loss-making companies and climbing deficit, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Also as a result, the institutional investors are sidestepping
the market and most of the institutional capital have been
siphoned off the market, which is clearly indicated in the
shrinking stock turnover, he added.
</P>
<P>
But Chen still views the market with optimism, saying the
investing risks have already been substantially reduced at
present, and the market does not have much downward space in the
coming days based on either political consideration or economic
fundamentals.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie has vowed to severely punish anyone proven to be involved
in corrupt, collusive or nepotistic practices, the Jakarta Post
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a plenary consultation with the Supreme Advisory
Council, Habibie said people who had borrowed or used state funds,
including bankers, were obligated to repay the money.
</P>
<P>
"If they are not able to repay their debts, they will be
punished as severely as possible, not just 5 years or 10 years but
50 years accumulatively," Habibie was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some newspaper reports have said former president Soeharto and
his family controlled assets worth 40 billion U.S. dollars.
Soeharto himself has denied he made a fortune in power.
</P>
<P>
The council's vice chairman, Achmad Tirtosudiro, told reporters
that Habibie used the meeting with the 45-member council as an
opportunity to evaluate his administration's achievements on its
100th day in power.
</P>
<P>
Habibie assumed the presidency on May 21, seconds after
Soeharto resigned amid strong domestic pressure from an escalating
economic and political crisis.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Airliner Crashes in Ecuador, Killing 86 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A Cuban airliner with 90 people on
board crashed shortly after takeoff from the Quito International
Airport Saturday, killing at least 86 people.
</P>
<P>
Among those killed were 76 passengers, six crew members and
four other people on the ground. Eight people on board the plane
survived the crash. More than 10 other people on the ground were
injured.
</P>
<P>
The plane arrived with tourists on earlier Saturday from
Havana. It was supposed to head back to Havana via Guayaquil, a
coastal city in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Airport officials told reporters that the Russian-made
Tupolev-154 plane failed to rise one or two minutes after takeoff
and lost altitude abruptly before crashing at a site 30 meters
from the runway on the northern tip of the airport.
</P>
<P>
Survivors said the plane seemed to have got engine troubles
before the crash. Airport officials said they had not received
any alarm from the crew beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorean television pictures showed that the nose and front
part of the plane disintegrated in the crash.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said,the plane crashed to the ground with huge roar
and burst into flames but did not explode. Some people on board
were still alive when the accident occurred. Several jumped out
of the plane with flames around the body.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters rushed to scene and put out the fire shortly after
the accident. They also doused the plane's turbine with chemicals
in fear of explosion.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that most of those killed were actually burned
to death after the crash.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the victims were Ecuadoreans, but also included
19 foreigners comprising Spaniads, Cubans, Chileans, Italians and
one Argentine.
</P>
<P>
All incoming and outgoing flights at the Quito International
Airport were suspended because of the accident, whose cause is
still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Trust Funds Set Up in Myanmar Hospitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Trust funds have been set up at
three Myanmar hospitals, including the largest and the oldest
Yangon General Hospital, to provide health services to poor and
needy patients.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government is rendering health services nation-wide
including rural and border areas with the aim of uplifting the
standard of health and fitness of the entire nation, Lt. Gen. Khin
Nyunt, first secretary of the State Peace and Development Council,
was quoted by Sunday's New Light of Myanmar newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government is still facing some difficulties in providing
health services for the entire population, Khin Nyunt, who is also
chairman of the National Health Committee, told a ceremony on
Saturday for setting up trust funds of a township hospital.
</P>
<P>
Although the cost-sharing healthcare system is being practiced
for those who can afford the expenses, the government is still
taking responsibility for poor and needy people, he added.
</P>
<P>
The cost-sharing healthcare system was introduced recently on
account of the limited ability of the government to bear all the
national health expenditures alone.
</P>
<P>
Up to March this year, there were 734 hospitals with more than
14,000 doctors in Myanmar, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has worked out a five-year national health plan for
1996-2001 which includes six broad programs and 50 detailed
projects.

<HEADLINE> Action Urged on Antitrust Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Economists are appealing to the
authorities to end the uncertainty over the draft antitrust law,
which they say is essential to set game rules for competition in
the marketplace and break up the state monopolies that have
dominated key sectors for half a century, reported today's China
Daily (Business Weekly).
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers' attitudes have advanced to such an extent that they
have even considered establishing a state fair trade commission,
similar to the US Federal Trade Commission, as an arbitrator to
help ensure implementation of the law, it said.
</P>
<P>
Economists involved are also beginning to consider a system in
which the governmental would be able to file suits against actions
that threaten competition, block market entry and abuse market
power.
</P>
<P>
Work on drafting an anti-monopoly law for China started in the
1980s. In the course of conducting research in competitive
economies such as the United States and Germany, and evaluating
different versions of anti-monopoly legislation, Chinese officials
and experts have come up with several drafts.
</P>
<P>
The law will be the major part of the answer to administrative
monopoly, the economists said.
</P>
<P>
Due to fears that it would hamper the growth of the 1,000
enterprise groups the central government has selected as the key
engines of economic development, the draft has been shelved and
the process towards legislation has come to a halt, it said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Aid for Flood-Stricken Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Saturday called on the international community to
assist flood-stricken Bangladesh in its disaster relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
Annan "is deeply distressed over the widespread devastation"
caused by flooding in the South Asian country, with two thirds of
its land lying under water, a statement issued through his
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"He calls on the international community to respond quickly and
generously to the appeal launched by the Government of Bangladesh
on Wednesday for urgently-required assistance for immediate relief
and longer-term rehabilitation," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, soon to return to the U.N. Headquarters from Africa
after vacation, expressed United Nations readiness to assist
Bangladesh in its relief efforts in very way possible.
</P>
<P>
About 25 million people have been affected by the worst
flooding in 10 years, caused by swollen water in rivers stemming
from the Himalayas, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Since July when floods began, over 400 people have been killed
and crops valued at 300 million U.S. dollars wiped out.

<HEADLINE> Sales Slowdown Squeezes Auto Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The output and sales of vehicles
in July declined sharply, increasing the pressure on car
manufacturers and the central government to take effective
measures to revive the flagging demand.
</P>
<P>
Output of motor vehicles totaled 115,600 units in July, down
one percent from the same month last year, according to the State
Machine-Building Industry Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Sales were down just over nine percent to 105,200, reported
today's China Daily (Business Weekly).
</P>
<P>
Compared to June this year, output and sales crashed by 21.4
percent and 27.8 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of 1998, unsold inventories reached
152,900 units, up 11.5 percent from the same period in 1997, it
reported.
</P>
<P>
Although auto sales are far from being the barometer of China's
national economic situation, the dramatic slump does partly
reflect the stagnant market reality.
</P>
<P>
Besides the impact of the floods, the sluggish situation can be
attributed to many factors: implementation of the anti-corruption
program and institutional restructuring; constraints on individual
purchase of vehicles; environmental concerns; slow expansion of
urban roads; burdens of debts and redundant employees on state
auto firms; and outdated products based on antiquated equipment
and backward technology.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Art Troupe Stages Musicals in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- An ethnic troupe from Lijiang
City, southwest China's Yunnan Province, is scheduled to stage a
series of traditional Chinese concerts of 1,000-year-old religious
music in five European countries.
</P>
<P>
The troupe will stage musical scores from Confucianism,
Buddhism and Taoism for audiences in France, Switzerland, Italy,
Belgium and the Netherlands. The tour begins next week.
</P>
<P>
Ancient Naxi music originated from the Taoist music dating back
as early as the Tang Dynasty (618-907), according to a leading
musician with the troupe.
</P>
<P>
The music matured and gained great popularity during the Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644), said the musician, adding that the Naxi
ethnic group has engaged in an extensive effort to save the art
form which was in danger of disappearing.
</P>
<P>
He added that Naxi musicians have exerted considerable effort
to retain and develop the music which is praised as "orthodox and
unpolluted classical Chinese music."
</P>
<P>
The music has gained a worldwide reputation in recent years,
with audiences in Britain and Norway responding warmly to the
troupe's performances.

<HEADLINE> Graf Beats Novotna to Win Pilot Pen Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Steffi Graf
claimed her first title in over a year today when she beat second
seed Czech Jana Novotna to win the 450,000 U.S. dollars Pilot Pen
tennis tournament in New Haven, Connecticut, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who missed most of the last season due to knee
surgery,found her form to beat reigning Wimbledon champion 6-4,
6-1 to win her first title since May 1997.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long road," said Graf, "I thought I was moving
well, didn't make a lot of mistakes and I was controlling the
points."
</P>
<P>
Graf, the fourth seed, captured her fourth title at this event
and the 104th of her legendary career. The 29-year-old Graf, a
five-time U.S. Open champion, is seeded eighth for the final
Grand Slam event of the year. She currently is ranked 38th in the
world,but with her victory today will jump to 27th in next week's
WTA rankings.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, who fell to 4-27 lifetime against Graf, was seeking
her 24th career singles title and fifth of the year, which would
have tied her with Switzerland's Patty Schnyder for the WTA Tour
lead.
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, Novotna will overtake Davenport as the
second-ranked player in the world in next week's rankings. Both
Novotna and Dawenport have a chance to replace Martina Hingis at t
he top spot following the U.S. Open.

<HEADLINE> Tottenham Score First Win in Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Tottenham Hotspur claimed their
first victory of the season at the English Premier League when
they defeated Everton 1-0 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The win took some pressure off their beleaguered Swiss manager
Christian Gross, who is in serious danger of being sacked after
his team began the season with two defeats following their narrow
escape from relegation last season.
</P>
<P>
A fifth-minute goal from England striker Les Ferdinand helped
the London club defeat Everton who have also started the season
poorly with just one point from three games.
</P>
<P>
The Goodison Park game attracted a great deal of interest
because of Gross's predicament. The British media have already
started speculating about a possible successor.
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the table, unbeaten Aston Villa went top
after a 1-0 victory at Sheffield Wednesday with forward Julian
Joachim scoring the crucial goal in the 37th minute.
</P>
<P>
Promoted Charlton Athletic continued their superb start by
snatching a goalless draw at reigning champions Arsenal, who
played most of the second half with 10 men after French World Cup
player Emmanuel Petit was sent off.
</P>
<P>
Charlton now have five points from three games and have yet to
concede a goal.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, former Dutch international Gullit will be the
center of attention again when Newcastle play Liverpool.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Take up Super League Gauntlet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- UEFA, European football
governing body, launched a counter-offensive against a breakaway
European Super League on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Warning the clubs who have been approached to join an
unsanctioned elite competition that they could face exile, UEFA's
president Lennart Johansson undertook to explore ways of
restructuring the existing continental tournaments to make them
richer and more acccessible for the big names in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Johnsson said in Monaco on Saturday that they will have a
first draft of proposals by early October and a working package
ready before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Among things to be considered are re-distribution of finance
and the possibility of wild cards in the European Cup.
</P>
<P>
"Reforms, if they are carried out, will be for the year 2000,"
said Johannson.
</P>
<P>
While arguing they must look after all echelons of the
game,UEFA recognise they must also satisfy the demands of the
most powerful clubs who have been attracted by the promise of far
greater revenue from the private Super League project.
</P>
<P>
"We must honour what the big clubs have done for us,"Johansson
said. "We must come up with a proposal to guide us into the next
millenium, but we can't be threatened by private proposals."
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference after an executive meeting: "All the
clubs want to remain in the same situation under the umbrella of
UEFA.
</P>
<P>
"We have declarations made by individual clubs and leagues(for
changes) but we must not be hasty in what we are doing."
</P>
<P>
Johansson announced the formation of a UEFA task force to
report to the executive committee at two-week intervals and
present a first draft of its proposals at a meeting in Lisbon on
October 6-7.
</P>
<P>
The task force will be working in close co-operation with five
major clubs, all former European champions -- Juventus,Liverpool,
Bayern Munich, Ajax Amsterdam and Olympique Marseille.
</P>
<P>
Johansson confirmed that next season's Champions' League would
have a change of format with four groups of six instead of six of
four.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of wild cards was under consideration for
major clubs in the Champions' League.
</P>
<P>
"I reacted negatively at first to this, but then found out
teams like Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan were concerned," he
said. This is perhaps something the task force must study ...to
give credit to some teams that have won five titles in 10 years."
</P>
<P>
He also promised: "We will look again at the whole
distribution of money."
</P>
<P>
UEFA indicated last week they might merge the UEFA Cup and Cup
Winners' Cup competitions but did not elaborate on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Johansson warned that if a club attracted by the private Super
League project signed up with Media Partners before UEFA
presented their new plans, they automatically excluded themselves
from the UEFA statutes.
</P>
<P>
UEFA general secretary Gerhard Aigner said that Media
Partners' claim last week that UEFA had agreed to co-operate in
their project was false.
</P>
<P>
"What is correct is that I said we think (the project) is not
in the spirit we would like to see in European competitions and
UEFA will not co-operate with any venture it can't identify
with," Aigner said.
</P>
<P>
World body FIFA's president Sepp Blatter, a guest of UEFA at
their executive meeting, said FIFA would discuss the issue at
their next executive committee meeting on September 24-25."FIFA
are behind the ideas UEFA will develop," Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Media Partners issued a statement on Saturday
saying that contrary to recent "misleading comments" from UEFA
officials, their plans did not include any rule changes to the
game itself.
</P>
<P>
Project leader Peter Ekelund said: "A separate body (not Media
Partners) will be responsible for regulating the EFL.Media
Partners will not propose any rule change to the regulatory body.
</P>
<P>
"Media Partners has invited UEFA to act as the regulatory body
for the new EFL."

<HEADLINE> International Coffee Organization Expanding Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China's millennium-old tea
culture has not shaken the International Coffee Organization's
resolve to develop the coffee market here.
</P>
<P>
In its latest move, the organization of 62 members which
produces over 95 percent of the world's coffee, recently hosted a
wide range of activities to popularize coffee culture among the
residents of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Through these activities, people got to know more about coffee,
its planting, bean roasting and marketing, as well as the
production of coffee machines and the operation of coffee bars.
</P>
<P>
In present-day China, most people, especially the elderly,
prefer tea to coffee. But there are a growing number of coffee
consumers among young people who usually resort to coffee to
freshen up. And some people consider coffee-drinking fashionable.
</P>
<P>
One organizer blames the currently small coffee market in China
on people's limited knowledge about coffee.  He said the
International Coffee Organization only exported 15 million
U.S. dollars worth of coffee to China in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the great coffee market potential in China has
attracted a group of international coffee companies which have
decided to try a long-term strategy to expand the Chinese market,
and chose Shanghai as a production center.
</P>
<P>
New Mandarin Coffee Co. Ltd. of the United States, for
instance, has solely funded a coffee-roasting plant in
Shanghai. This plant, which only recently began production, is
able to produce 3,000 tons of coffee a year.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China does not have its own coffee brands, but
efforts are underway to foster China's own coffee-growing bases.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in some parts of southwest China's Yunnan Province
where soil and climate are close to that in the coffee-growing
areas of Colombia, have started to grow quality coffee which has
been highly praised by experts from the International Coffee
Organization.

</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Two laws concerning higher education and land management
were passed at the Fourth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the
Ninth National People's Congress which ended yesterday. The two
laws will both become valid on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
-- A front-paged commentary published today said that science

</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- The 8th flood crest passed the Cuntan Hydrological Station
in Chongqing in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River yesterday
moring. The PLA army men and residents alongside the river
continued to keep alert and were ready to safeguard the dykes.
</P>
<P>
-- This year's 8th flood crest along the Yangtze River will
reach Yichang, Hubei Province, on August 31, 1998, according to a
circular issued by the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters. High water levels resulting from torrential rains
continue to haunt areas in the upper reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
-- By the end of 1997, China had had 13.833 million women
officials, accounting for 34.4 percent of the country's total

</P>
<P>
-- Economists are appealing to the authorities to end the
uncertainty over the draft antitrust law, which they say is
essential to set game rules for competition in the marketplace and
break up the state monopolies that have dominated key sectors for
half a century.
</P>
<P>
-- Local governments in flooded areas have curbed the inflation
caused by fears aroused by the country's worst floods since
1954. Grain and vegetable prices had doubled in the initial
flooding period in the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and
Heilongjiang, according to local media.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM to Announce Federal Election Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard is set to call a federal election later Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister came to Canberra from Sydney Sunday morning
to make a visit to Australian Governor-General William Deane, the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's office called a press conference at 11:30
a.m. (local time), where Howard is expected to announce either
October 3 or October 10 as the day for a federal election.
</P>
<P>
Under the Australian constitution, the governor-general may
dissolve the House of Representatives for a federal election on
the advice of the prime minister, and there must be the minimum 33
day election period after the prime minister calls a federal
election.
</P>
<P>
Given the minimum 33 day election period, the visit points to
an election on October 3.
</P>
<P>
However, he could opt for a longer campaign, leaving open the
option of an October 10 poll, the Australian Associated Press
said.
</P>
<P>
Howard's meeting with the governor-general follows weeks of
speculation about an election. The Howard government has until
next May to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
Tax reform is expected to be a major issue at the election.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Australian Liberal Party and National Party
coalition, which was swept to power at the 1996 election, has
proposed on August 13 a major overhaul of Australia's tax system
featuring tax cuts and higher welfare payments in return for a 10
percent goods and services tax.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Labor Party, the nation's leading opposition
party, last week countered by releasing a tax package without a
goods and services tax and with tax cuts targeted at low and
middle income earners.
</P>
<P>
An October election would also be the first federal test for
Pauline Hanson's fledgling One Nation Party which made major
inroads into the major parties' vote in the Queensland state poll
in June.

<P>
QUITO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A Cuban airliner with 90 people on
board caught fire during takeoff from the Quito International
Airport and slammed into a soccer field Saturday, killing at least
86 people.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that those killed were 76 passengers,
six crew members and four other people on the ground. Eight
people on board the plane survived the crash. More than 10 other
people on the ground were injured.
</P>
<P>
Airport officials told reporters that the Russian-made
Tupolev-154 plane failed to lift itself one or two minutes after
takeoff and lost altitude swiftly. It narrowly missed a busy
street in a middle class residential area at the end of the
runway, which lies at 2,800 meters in the Andes mountains.
</P>
<P>
Survivors said the plane seemed to have got engine problems
before the accident.  Ecuadorean television pictures showed that
the nose and front part of the plane disintegrated in the crash.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the victims were Ecuadoreans, but 19 were
foreigners, including Spaniads, Cubans, Chileans, Italians and one
Argentine.
</P>
<P>
All incoming and outgoing flights at Quito's airport were
suspended because of the accident, whose cause is still under
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Beats Rusedski to Reach Hamlet Cup Tennis Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Two days before he begins to
defend his U.S. Open title, Australian Patrick Rafter today beat
his opponent in last year's final, Britain's Greg Rusedski, to
reach the final of the Hamlet Cup tennis event in New York, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The second seed Rafter broke Rusedski once in each set in
recording a 6-4, 7-5 victory that moved the Australian into his
third final of the summer.
</P>
<P>
Rafter will face the winner of tonight's second semi-final
match between Russian teenager Marat Safin and eighth seed Felix
Mantilla of Spain.
</P>
<P>
With today's win, Rafter improved to 17-2 in the summer
hardcourt season, winning back-to-back Super 9 titles in Toronto
