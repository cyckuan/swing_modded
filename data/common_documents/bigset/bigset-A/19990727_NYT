SEAGRAM SHEDDING CONCERT OPERATIONS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Entertainment conglomerate Seagram Co. agreed
Monday to sell its 20-site Universal Concerts business to House of
Blues for more than $190 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal moves House of Blues into national prominence as a
concert promoter. The first club opened in Cambridge in late 1992,
followed by 1994 openings in New Orleans and the flagship West
Hollywood site on Sunset Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   House of Blues operates seven nightclubs with capacities of up
to 2,000 while many of the Universal venues are significantly
larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created a powerhouse of a company through this
acquisition,'' proclaimed Grege Trojan, president of House of
Blues.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which will close in September, calls for Seagram to
retain ownership of the flagship Universal Amphitheater while House
of Blues operates the venue as part of a long-term lease. Universal
Concerts owns, operates or exclusively books venues in Atlanta;
Austin, Texas; Cleveland; Denver; Las Vegas; Portland, Ore.; San
Diego; Seattle; Toronto; and Vancouver, British Columbia. It also
promotes nonsymphony events at the Hollywood Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram spokeswoman Anita Larsen said Universal Concerts is
profitable, but its sale is part of Seagram's strategy, announced
in mid-December, to unload $1 billion in noncore assets to cut debt
following its $10.4 billion buyout of PolyGram NV. Seagram has
since sold PolyGram's film libraries for $400 million and its Mumm
and Perrier-Jouret sparking wines business for $310 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has endorsed Seagram's strategy of focusing on its
recorded music business and its stock is up 40 percent from
mid-December. The issue rose 12.5 cents to $51.375 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Marciano, president of Universal Concerts, and his
management team will stay on to run the business. The deal also
gives Seagram the option to buy up to 1 percent of privately owned
House of Blues and provides for GetMusic.com, operated by Universal
and BMG, to become exclusive Internet commerce provider for House
of Blues.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes in the wake of extensive consolidation in the
concert business. New York-based SFX Entertainment Corp., which has
82 venues, has been buying up smaller rivals, including longtime
Los Angeles promoter Avalon Entertainment. Trojan said the deal
will enable House of Blues, which also runs a record label and
retail operation, to become a one-stop shop for artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``HOB is the only live entertainment company that can offer the
artist exposure from the small club level through to an
Amphitheater, partnered with live digital broadcasts over the
Internet,'' he added.

RIOS NOT HIP TO L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ L.A.'s the place for David Wheaton, sort of. But
it's definitely not for Marcelo Rios.
</P>
<P>
   Although he lost to Canada's Sebastian Lareau 6-4, 6-2 Monday,
Wheaton, an All-American at Stanford, was the happiest of
first-round losers. That's because this was the first time this
season he qualified for the main draw.
</P>
<P>
   Rios, the fourth seed and former world's No. 1-ranked player,
pulled out of the Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA on Monday with
tendinitis in both hips, a day before his scheduled first-round
match with qualifier Magnus Larsson of Sweden. Larsson today will
play another qualifier, Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand, his
country's top player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst (year) of my career,'' Rios said. ``It's the
first time I've been so injured in my four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rios also has had back and elbow problems. But his hips started
hurting last week, although he played in the Mercedes Cup in
Stuttgart, Germany. He didn't expect this. Not after flying in
following his third-round exit from the Mercedes Cup. Rios arrived
here Saturday feeling fine.
</P>
<P>
   The pain flared, so on Monday Rios visited Dr. George Fareed,
who suggested rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like a 100-percent player,'' Rios said. ``I'll
have treatment tomorrow and see how it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although clearly frustrated, Rios, who reached No. 1 in March
1998 without ever having won a Grand Slam, found the positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can win the top ones, you can do it again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton would like to prove that true. He once was a top-20
player, having reached the Australian and U.S. Open quarterfinals
in 1990 and the Wimbledon semis in '91.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's fighting age and injuries. He's 30 and has struggled
since having a bone spur in his foot removed two years ago and
elbow surgery in January 1998. His ranking has gone from a high of
12 in 1991 to 300-something now.
</P>
<P>
   `Once you've been hurt, it's a hard climb back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This season serves as proof. Wheaton has played in at least
eight qualifying and challenger tournaments with little success.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, he reached the final of qualifying in doubles.
Playing singles, he lost in the final round at Delray Beach (Fla.),
7-5 in the third and final set. At Newport, R.I., he reached the
final but suffered heat exhaustion. In Birmingham, Ala., he served
for the match in the second round and lost. At Aptos last week, he
had match point in the first round and lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I'm winning,'' he said. ``I'm like 15-11 on the
year. I shouldn't get discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has had his moments when he thought about finding a
new career, only to decide he isn't ready yet. Then came Los
Angeles, which he sees as his latest proof he can again find
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm close,'' he said. ``It's funny, but I'm 30
years old, and I need to get some exposure playing the good guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Lareau, who once won junior doubles titles at Roland Garros and
Wimbledon, is better than anyone Wheaton has played lately in
qualifying. Wheaton also hurt himself with several double faults
and by failing to hold serve four times.
</P>
<P>
   But at least he reached the main draw. He hoopes to continue a
comeback next week in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's as long as I feel like I'm still contending in
matches and not just getting beat in the first round all the time.
. . . If I did it once, I must have it in me to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   In other first-round matches Monday, Frenchmen Anthony Dupuis
handed Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden his seventh first-round exit of the
year 6-4, 6-4. Qualifier James Sekulov of Australia beat Martin
Damm of the Czech Republic, setting up a second-round match with
fifth-seeded Thomas Enqvist, who swept Australian Mark Woodforde.

MAN CONFESSES TO 4 KILLINGS AT YOSEMITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A motel handyman who was dismissed as a suspect
in the deaths of three sightseers last February at Yosemite
National Park has confessed to the decapitation of a park
naturalist last week and to the other three killings, according to
an FBI affidavit and to an official involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Stayner, 37, confessed to the killing of Joie Ruth
Armstrong, 26, and has provided details about the crime that only
the killer could have known, according to the FBI affidavit filed
on Monday in Federal District Court in Fresno, Calif. He has also
confessed to the other slayings, a law enforcement official
confirmed, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner worked as a janitor at the Cedar Lodge in El Portal at
the western edge of Yosemite, where the three sightseers were last
seen alive.
</P>
<P>
   His confession _ or confessions _ mark another turn in a case
that has FBI officials wondering whether the latest killing could
have been prevented. The FBI had said on Sunday that evidence
obtained after Ms. Armstrong's death linked Stayner to the slayings
of the three sightseers and that it was pursuing an investigation
of those killings. The official said the bureau was looking for
evidence to corroborate the confession.
</P>
<P>
   The sightseers' disappearance from the Cedar Lodge in February
set off an extensive search, national headlines and numerous
arrests of ex-convicts whom the FBI has called unofficial suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was arrested Saturday at a nudist resort near
Sacramento, Calif., and charged with one count of murder in the
death of Ms. Armstrong on Monday afternoon in federal court in
Sacramento. At his brief court appearance, Stayner, a muscular,
clean-cut man dressed in an orange prison uniform, said nothing but
nodded repeatedly as the federal magistrate, Judge Peter A.
Nowinski, asked him if he understood the charge and read him his
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Like all other residents living near the Cedar Lodge, Stayner,
who had rented a room above the restaurant adjacent to the motel
for two years, was questioned at the time of the sightseers'
disappearance. The law-enforcement official who would speak only on
the condition of not being identified said Stayner was probaby
dismissed as a suspect, at least in part, because the authorities
believed the slayings could not have been committed by only one
person.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stayner has not yet been charged with the deaths of
Carole Sund, 42, her daughter Juli Sund, 15, and their friend
Silvina Pelosso, 16, the FBI believes he is the only person
responsible, said James M. Maddock, the agency's special agent in
charge of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has refused to discuss details regarding the links among
the slayings. But The Modesto Bee, quoting unidentified sources,
reported that such evidence was found in Stayner's room and that
Juli Sund's throat was slashed almost to the point of beheading,
like Ms. Armstrong's.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Carole Sund and Miss Pelosso were found in the
trunk of their charred rental car more than a month after they
disappeared. Juli Sund's body was found a few days later, off a
little-traveled road.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Armstrong's body was found on Thursday, one day after she
was last seen near the cabin where she lived with her boyfriend and
another roommate, both of whom were away. Until then, the FBI had
maintained that it believed all the people responsible for the
Sund-Pelosso deaths were in custody, though on unrelated charges.
Numerous ex-convicts with either ties to El Portal or Modesto,
where Carole Sund's wallet was found three days after the trio
disappeared, have been held for months for various offenses while
officials have tried to gather enough evidence to charge them with
the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was questioned about Ms. Armstrong twice on Thursday, a
day after his sport utility vehicle was spotted near her cabin
about an hour after she was last seen.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing in the Armstrong case was scheduled for Aug. 6 in
federal court in Fresno, where the case is being moved, but John P.
Balasz, the assistant federal defender who represented Stayner,
said the hearing will probably be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner's arrest has prompted sheriff's detectives in Merced
County, where Stayner lived until moving to El Portal in 1997, to
announce that they were re-examining the unsolved 1990 death of his
uncle, Jerry Stayner, who was shot to death in what authorities had
considered a botched burglary.

Cowboys send urgent message to draft choices
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JODY GOLDSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has a message for his
1999 draft picks:
</P>
<P>
   Get signed and get to camp, or suffer the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an individual or his representative can't see how important
it is to get him in here, we mark that down someplace for the
future,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only three have heeded the warning. Seventh-round pick
Mike Lucky signed a three-year contract last week. Former Texas A&AMP;M
linebacker Dat Nguyen and Texas receiver Wane McGarity signed on
the eve of reporting day.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies and select veterans were due to report to Midwestern
State University on Monday. The first practice is this morning. All
others are due on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, the Cowboys' third-round pick, signed a three-year deal
worth a reported $1.2 million, which included a $350,000 signing
bonus. He will receive $175,000 this year, $250,000 next year and
$325,000 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of McGarity's deal were not released. He was one of the
club's two fourth-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves five draftees unsigned, most notably defensive end
Ebenezer Ekuban and offensive tackle Solomon Page, the top two
picks. The Cowboys hope Ekuban can contribute immediately in
pass-rushing situations. Page is to be groomed to replace nine-year
veteran Erik Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts a rookie not to be in training camp for the very
first practice, the very first meeting,'' Jones said. ``Does it
hurt the team? Yes, it does, but not as much as if we gave him what
the agents for the rookie want us to give him that's keeping him
out of camp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys began negotiating with their draft picks only about
a week ago, a date that was strategically picked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to drive this process; we don't want to be driven,''
Jones said. ``The more compact you can get the negotiating period
to make a decision, the better it is for our football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've negotiated on the clock during the draft. We've had
contracts signed within hours of the draft being over. I've spent
some money that I shouldn't have spent negotiating during the
draft. I'd have been better off negotiating just before we reported
(to camp), and we would have gotten a better deal, which ultimately
would have made us a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   Any or all of the remaining rookies could be signed before the
team takes the field this morning, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very involved with the ones who haven't agreed,'' he
said. ``Don't use the word close for any reason. But the issues
involved should not, in my opinion, prevent a rookie from being
here tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   In other news, the Cowboys are awaiting word on the length of
Leon Lett's suspension. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has not ruled
on how much time the defensive tackle must miss after another
violation of the league's substance abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's on the commissioner's timetable,'' Jones said. ``We had
thought we might have a word early in our training camp. It may
still be, but it's his time frame, and I don't know that he's made
any decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The other mystery time frame concerns the return of cornerback
Deion Sanders, who is rehabilitating after offseason surgery on his
big toe. At this point, Sanders is questionable for the Sept. 12
opener at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's running hard on machines,'' Jones said. ``Beginning right
now, he'll begin running without machines, doing a lot of
straight-ahead running. He's progressing, but I'm told we won't
know anything really until he starts pushing off, starts cutting
and gets into football situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also announced they are resurrecting their tradition
of a blue-white scrimmage. It will take place at 8 p.m. Aug. 5 at
Memorial Stadium in Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys won't scrimmage another NFL team, as they have in
previous seasons.

CART, IRL close to reconciliation
<TEXT>
<P>
   By TERRY BLOUNT
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Officials for CART and the Indy Racing League
have been quiet lately about the prospects of a reconciliation.
Maybe too quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the negotiations say talks between leaders of
the rival circuits have made ``significant progress'' in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And two officials for the CART engine manufacturers say a
compromise proposal might make it possible for the leagues to race
together next year at the Indianapolis 500 before racing as one
league in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   CART president Andrew Craig talked with reporters for more than
45 minutes after Sunday's U.S. 500 at Michigan Speedway. Although
he didn't reveal much concrete information, it was a rare post-race
appearance for Craig.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having one series probably is critical to not confusing the
public,'' Craig said. ``I don't want to comment on any rumors, but
I will say that a lot of elements must be worked out before
anything can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying a lot on the record, but merger rumors were
rampant in every team's garage at Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   One source said the reason talks have become more fruitful
recently is the fact CART team owners Bobby Rahal and Barry Green
have taken lead roles in the negotiations. CART team owner Roger
Penske admitted he has stepped away from the negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal and Green are considered to be a little less
confrontational and more receptive to new ideas. Rahal has been a
hard-liner at times, but he also is a former golfing buddy of IRL
founder Tony George.
</P>
<P>
   One scenario being discussed is for Craig to step down and Greg
Penske, Roger's son, to take over as the president of CART. Greg
Penske is the president of the California Speedway, but Roger
Penske recently sold his tracks in Michigan, California and
Nazareth, Pa., to NASCAR's International Speedway Corp.
</P>
<P>
   There are indications something may be in the works for next
year. CART has tabled discussions of new rules and testing dates
for 2000, something that usually is already being decided. CART
also has yet to name a replacement for retiring chief steward Wally
Dallenbach.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, engine manufacturers say it's too late for the
open-wheel leagues to come together as one league for the 2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about 2001 now, and we're very close to being
out of time for that,'' said Lee White, general manager for Toyota
Racing Development. ``We will have to know by Labor Day if we are
going to go to a completely different (engine) formula. If
discussions drag on until the end of the year, it would be very
difficult for all of us to get ready by 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   The drastic differences between the types of engines the cars
use and how they are distributed has been the biggest obstacle to a
resolution between the two circuits. But Ford Racing executive Greg
Specht said some type of engine equivalency formula might allow the
two leagues to race together at Indianapolis next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something we would want to do over the long haul, but
it could work for this one situation,'' Specht said. ``It might be
fun. We could look at it as the final showdown between the two
leagues while they're still apart.''
</P>
<P>
   CART uses turbo-charged, 2.65-liter motors, while the IRL uses
normally aspirated 4.0-liter engines. But the IRL is switching to
3.5-liter engines next season.
</P>
<P>
   CART has Mercedes, Honda, Ford and Toyota as its engine
suppliers through a leasing program from the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL uses Oldsmobile and Nissan and gets its engines at a
much lower cost per season than the CART system. The CART
manufacturers build and maintain the engines, but the IRL teams are
able to make changes to their motors.
</P>
<P>
   The engine leasing program in CART can cost more than $1 million
a season with the top teams, something the IRL teams say they
cannot afford. But Specht believes that problem can be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the lease situation is a deal-breaker,'' Specht
said. ``That can be worked out. Ford is willing to do whatever is
reasonable. It's high on our agenda because there is a sense of
urgency to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   For the two leagues to race together at Indy next year, some
sort of limit would need to be placed on the CART engines. CART
engines run at 15,000 RPMs while the IRL recently lowered its RPM
limit to 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some type of rev-limiter on the CART engines might enable the
cars to compete equally next year at Indy until new engines could
be built.
</P>
<P>
   White said Toyota is receptive to design changes if it will
bring the leagues together, which might mean some type of normally
aspirated engine for all the cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very willing to consider almost any option in rules as
long as it's within reason,'' White said. ``It's paramount for the
future to have all the open-wheel cars at the Indianapolis 500.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's U.S. 500 was another indication that the four-year
split between the two leagues is hurting the sport. The inaugural
U.S. 500 in 1996 drew more than 110,000 fans to the two-mile oval,
but fewer than 50,000 were in attendance Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth consecutive year that attendance has declined
for the event. The NASCAR Winston Cup race at Michigan one month
ago drew a sellout crowd of more than 160,000.
</P>
<P>
   Said one CART driver Sunday: ``If this doesn't tell (CART and
IRL officials) they have a problem, they'll never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRL event at Atlanta Motor Speedway earlier this month drew
fewer than 30,000, a decrease of more than 20,000 from the Atlanta
race in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It has become clear to everyone in Indy-car racing that
something has to change. For the first time, it appears both
leagues are serious about making those changes.

Armstrong's win draws attention to foundation
<TEXT>
<P>
   By NEIL HOHLFELD
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Even after the initial rush of publicity over Lance Armstrong's
stunning victory in the Tour de France begins to ebb, Karl
Haussmann hopes he's still working 18-hour days.
</P>
<P>
   Haussmann is the executive director of the Lance Armstrong
Foundation, a nonprofit organization established by Armstrong after
he was diagnosed with testicular cancer less than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Haussmann, his one full-time staffer, a couple of interns and a
number of volunteers at the Austin-based foundation were riding the
draft Monday of Armstrong's victory in the world's most prestigious
cycling race. The foundation no doubt will benefit from the
attention Armstrong has received.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, we expect an increase in interest after what Lance
accomplished,'' Haussmann said. ``I mean, we haven't had any calls
from people saying, `Now I know you're there, so here's $1
million.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But there will be a long-term lasting effect. More
corporations will be willing to talk to us. There will be more
sponsorship, which ultimately will lead to more research. More
people will know what we're about. We'll be a little bit more
mainstream, and we want that growth. The more (funds) we generate,
the more we can help.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's mission is to help people manage and survive
cancer through research, education and awareness. It raises money
through an annual cycling event in Austin over Memorial Day weekend
and through other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the foundation awarded more than $250,000 in
research grants to study testicular cancer and urologic cancer.
According to the foundation's Web site (www.laf.org), Dr. Ellen
Gritz of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston received one
grant to lead a study that focuses on the effects of chemotherapy
for the treatment of testicular cancer on neurocognitive function.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the foundation is patient-focused. This is of
particular concern to Armstrong, who wants all those diagnosed with
testicular cancer to have access to the latest advances in
screening, diagnosis and treatment. Armstrong's experience after he
learned he had cancer was the genesis for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a pretty miserable experience in his post-diagnosis
stage,'' Haussmann said. ``He felt there was a severe lack of
information, and he found himself surfing the Net, trying to get
any kind of information about what he was going though.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty scared, and with nowhere to turn for help, it
made it worse. Lance has said he doesn't want anyone to go through
the same experience he had.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 27, grew up in Plano before moving to Austin. He was
a world-class cyclist when, at the age of 25 in 1996, he was told
he had a lethal variety of testicular cancer that had spread to his
lungs, abdomen and brain.
</P>
<P>
   He underwent surgery twice, once to remove his right testicle
and again to have two brain lesions removed. Armstrong also
underwent four rounds of intense chemotherapy. Doctors gave him
less than a 50 percent chance to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeries and chemotherapy eliminated the cancer, and
Armstrong began his cycling comeback. He sat out all of 1997, raced
briefly in 1998 and set his sights on competing in the Tour de
France this year.
</P>
<P>
   During one of Armstrong's last visits with friends and
supporters in Austin this summer, Haussmann admitted talking with
people about how it might be too much to ask of Armstrong to win
the Tour de France. They believed in their man, but they also knew
how difficult it would be to overcome the ravages of chemotherapy
in a sport as demanding as cycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talked to Lance about the possibility of winning the
Tour, there was always the feeling that it might be too soon,''
Haussmann said. ``We believed he could do it _ but maybe not right
now, not so soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he'd have a great Tour, possibly lead a little, win
some stages, maybe finish in the top three. I'd love to say we were
right there with him from the start. Don't get me wrong, we're huge
believers in what he does when he puts his mind to it. But toxic
drugs from chemotherapy can do irreparable damage to the body. You
don't know what kind of effect it will have on the body. We were
unsure of that, not of Lance's desire to win.''
</P>
<P>
   When Armstrong came through in France, the ripple effect was
felt in Austin. Haussmann said Monday it was all he could do to
return the hundreds of phone calls the foundation has received.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you could ever imagine the kind of exposure this
has generated,'' Haussmann said. ``We've got calls from all manner
of media outlets, wanting to know what the foundation does, how
people can find out more about it. We're getting calls from
companies looking to sponsor events rather than having to hunt them
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our Web site, we've already sold out of most of the gear _
hats, T-shirts and cycling jerseys. We've reordered three times,
and we'll reorder as long as we have to. It's the kind of thing
that people all over the world feel good about.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the corporate end of the foundation, Haussmann said
Armstrong's success after his illness has helped lift the spirits
of others undergoing what he went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the hundreds of e-mails that have been sent to Lance in the
last month, the word inspiration shows up nearly every time,''
Haussmann said. ``What Lance has accomplished gives people hope,
which is something they might not have had yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance will tell you that this entire experience is one of the
best things that ever happened to him. It helped get a better
perspective on his life. No longer is cycling the most important
thing in his life, and it shouldn't be to anyone else. Your life
and health and family all come first. He's been humbled by the
cancer, but his determination never wavered.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he wanted to do with the foundation was to fund research,
but also to give people with cancer the information he didn't get.
With research and information and Lance's determination and
accomplishments, maybe we can give people hope.''

Injury won't keep Biggio from playing on
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Astros filled in the blanks Monday regarding the
pain that has lingered in second baseman Craig Biggio's left
shoulder for two months.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, who disclosed Sunday he has been playing with pain since
early June, has a slight tear of the labrum in his left shoulder, a
condition he can play through for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The injury likely will require arthroscopic surgery in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI on Biggio's left shoulder following the All-Star break
revealed a tear in the cartilage surrounding the rotator cuff,
Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to have an MRI just to find out exactly what was
wrong in there,'' Hunsicker said. ``The MRI disclosed a slight tear
of the labrum. It's something he will continue to play with. We
don't anticipate it getting any worse than it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all probability, we will have to surgically repair it when
the season is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, 33, spoke publicly of his injury Sunday but gave few
details, saying only that he would ``probably have it fixed in the
offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker said based on the fact Biggio has played with the
injury for two months, there is little reason to believe the
seven-time All-Star won't be able to continue to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to come out of the lineup unless there is
something really significantly wrong,'' Hunsicker said. ``I'm not
minimizing the fact it's painful. This is something he has a
reasonable chance to play with for the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio has hit safely in 22 of his last 25 games, posting a .369
batting average during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker said former Astros third baseman Sean Berry played
with a torn rotator cuff in his right (throwing) arm during the
entire 1997 season, and Cincinnati righthander Pete Harnisch, also
a former Astro, is currently playing with a torn labrum in his
pitching shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that unusual,'' Hunsicker said. ``(But) any time one
of your star players has a physical problem, it's a concern. I know
he has good days and bad days, some days where it's a significant
factor for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take consolation in the fact he has been able to play with
it and been pretty darn good.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio said he first remembers experiencing pain while
stretching during the Astros' series in Milwaukee June 1-3. The
pain is most evident when he bats _ his left shoulder is his lead
shoulder _ and on certain defensive moves.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker said the MRI was performed to ``satisfy Biggio's
curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to know what was wrong,'' Hunsicker said. ``He said
before he had it, `I don't care what it says. I'm still playing
with it.' That's why we didn't say much about it, because he is
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio has never been on the disabled list in his 10-plus
major-league seasons and has missed only three games since 1996. He
played in a club-record 494 consecutive games between 1995-98.

BID TO RESCUE CITY'S SCHOOL BUILDINGS WAS HARD-WIRED TO FAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change `last March' to `last year' in lede graf. No other
changes.)  (mk) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN, JACQUES STEINBERG and CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A fire that was touched off by a welder working in a
Brooklyn vocational school briefly trapped 150 students last year.
The construction work was not supposed to begin until school was
done for the day, but school administrators and construction
officials could not agree on when classes were actually over.
</P>
<P>
   A new elementary school opened in upper Manhattan in 1995 with
problems ranging from loose floor tiles to a broken elevator. It
took three years to fix all the problems, while officials at the
New York City Board of Education and the School Construction
Authority argued about whose job it was to make the repairs.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the state Legislature created the construction
authority and joined it in a shotgun marriage with the city's
school board, the breakdown in their relationship has been a major
obstacle to reaching the goal that was set for them: mending and
expanding the nation's largest school system by century's end.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators were hoping to rescue a school system whose building
division was taking 10 years, and often a few bribes, to build a
single school, but in their haste to solve the problem they
effectively hard-wired the new arrangement for failure. They made
the board the client and the new authority its builder, but they
never specified where one agency's job ends and the other's begins.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as city and state officials are beginning to pour $7
billion into school construction and repairs over the next five
years, they have done little to fix the broken partnership. The
board is slow to plan, and the authority is lax in policing
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   An almost unfathomable amount of work must be done. An analysis
of the city's most recent school-by-school engineering survey by
The New York Times shows that at least 40 percent of the 1,100
schools are plagued by porous roofs, disintegrating facades or
windows that do not open or shut.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, the board and the authority were overwhelmed by
the job of rebuilding a deteriorating system in which half the
school buildings were built before 1940.
</P>
<P>
   And the construction process became infected by the very
politics that had eaten at the schools for generations. The
construction apparatus is overseen by one appointee each of the
governor, the mayor and the city schools chancellor. Any top
official can take credit for successes, but no one is directly
responsible for failures.
</P>
<P>
   Since the construction budget ultimately has to be approved by
the mayor and the City Council, horse-trading is rampant.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report on the five-year plan that just expired included
hundreds of projects on 43 single-spaced pages _ many for critical
wall, window and roof work _ that had been promised, only to be
deferred. They were replaced by 35 pages of other projects, most
picked by the mayor and the Council.
</P>
<P>
   The changes make for dashed hopes at schools like John Bowne
High School in Queens. In the fall of 1997, the board informed
Bowne administrators that its laboratories would be renovated,
welcome news since three of its labs are 35 years old and the
fourth is a home economics classroom.
</P>
<P>
   But in March 1998, after the new labs were already designed, the
board suspended the project indefinitely, deciding instead to
repair the exteriors of other schools.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the project died matters little at a school where the
advanced placement environmental sciences class is held in an old
kitchen. There, 22 students share two sinks and cannot light Bunsen
burners on the counter tops for fear of setting the wooden cabinets
on fire. Instead, they hold the burners in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The people who run the authority and board are quick to point
out that whatever the shortcomings of the last decade, they have
produced classroom space for 115,000 students, 76,000 within the
last five years. Schools are now erected in as little as three
years, much quicker than the average of 10 years it took in the
1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet fewer than half of the new classroom seats, about 53,500,
are in new, permanent buildings. More than a third, about 42,000,
sit in leased commercial spaces, in makeshift classrooms
partitioned from existing classes and locker rooms, or in factories
and other buildings that the board now owns. The remainder, about
20,000, are in trailers and other portable buildings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A recent survey by the board found that almost a third of the
city's schools had their windows or roofs replaced, their exterior
masonry shored up or some combination over the last five years. But
that yearlong survey also found that one out of four city schools
had seriously deteriorated roofs or exterior walls, and two out of
five had deteriorated windows.
</P>
<P>
   In a more disturbing finding, the survey highlighted significant
problems in a number of schools that were either built or repaired
by the authority within the last five years. Those deficiencies,
often in the very roofs or set of windows that were to have been
fixed, point to any number of shortcomings in the system, from
sluggish contractors to a maintenance budget so paltry that it
allows for little maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this leaves teachers and students waiting, people
like Karina Constantino, the principal of P.S. 22 on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   The authority spent $2 million putting a new roof on the school
and sealing its brickwork from 1995 through 1997. But almost two
years later, the roof leaks in seven places, she said, pointing out
the wide, wet blotches on the ceilings of a number of classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Constantino is hardly surprised, since she said it was often
up to her to bound up to the roof to scrape her fingernails against
freshly set mortar to determine its consistency or to check whether
the chimney was in danger of falling _ tasks, she says, the
authority should have been doing.

CONFUSION REIGNS IN VARGAS ARREST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fernando Vargas, the IBF junior middleweight
champion, was arrested early Sunday for assault, but those close to
him say HE was the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas and four companions were booked for assault with a deadly
weapon, conspiracy to commit a crime and burglary. According to
Santa Barbara County sheriff's Sgt. Bill Turner, the four allegedly
forced their way into a home near Santa Barbara and beat
23-year-old Doug Rossi with blunt objects.
</P>
<P>
   The fighter's representatives claim he was beaten by two men and
was merely defending himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would never do something like that,'' said Shelly Finkel,
Vargas' co-manager. ``This is over a girl. The whole thing is
silly.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident unfolded this way, according to the police report:
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, 21, was visiting a woman when, at about 4 a.m., another
man _ whose name is being withheld by police _ arrived unannounced
to see the woman. The two argued and began to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi, who was in the house, then jumped in to break up the
fight and the unidentified man left.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' companions arrived at about 5 a.m., forced their way
into a room occupied by Rossi and a female companion and beat him
up. He was treated and released at Cottage Hospital in Santa
Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether Vargas took part in the beating.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects were apprehended by deputies about six miles from
the home as they drove in Vargas' car on the Ventura Freeway. They
were identified at the scene of the traffic stop by the women who
were in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard that the suspects were upset with Rossi because
Rossi apparently had let the (unidentified) guy into the house,''
Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' people tell a different story.
</P>
<P>
   They say he was beaten by two men _ it's not clear whether Rossi
was one of them _ before his companions arrived. Police confirmed
that Vargas suffered injuries to his head and back, although none
were serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``They turned the whole thing around,'' said Fernando Flores, a
friend of Vargas' and the older brother of Freddie Flores, one of
those arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat up Fernando, they jumped him, they hit him with
metal bars,'' said Flores, to whom Freddie Flores related what had
happened. ``The cops have a picture of Fernando's back. He's all
marked up and everything. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is (his friends) got there and found Fernando
beaten. Like any friend, they tried to get the guys who did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified man had yet to be interviewed in depth by
police as of late Monday afternoon. Turner said neither he nor
Rossi are suspects but that the investigation is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (unidentified) guy obviously was involved in an
altercation with Vargas,'' Turner said. ``I can't speak for the
investigators, but obviously we want to talk to him about his
involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' representatives are convinced he will be vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, Mr. Vargas was the victim of an assault by two
individuals and merely took action to defend himself,'' Gregory W.
Moreno, Vargas' attorney, said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced that this charge will quickly be rectified by
the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, a 1996 Olympian, is emerging as a star in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   He became the youngest fighter to win a major junior
middleweight title _ five days after he turned 21 _ when he knocked
out Yory ``Boy'' Campas in December. He has successfully defended
his belt twice, the last time stopping Raul Marquez on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas also recently had signed an endorsement contract with
Miller Brewing Co. and was negotiating for other lucrative deals.
</P>
<P>
   Rolando Arellano, Vargas' co-manager, said the fighter _ who has
only a speeding ticket on his record _ is ``devastated'' over this
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at the peak of his career,'' Fernando Flores said. ``Why
would he want to jeopardize his career? He has too much to lose to
be gambling like that. I know Fernando better than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good person, very friendly, not the type of person who
goes around picking fights. That's why I was shocked when I heard
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspects face a maximum penalty of four years in state
prison for assault with a deadly weapon.

PEREZ WOULD BALK AT MOVE TO MINORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If the Los Angeles Dodgers elect to send pitcher
Carlos Perez to Triple-A Albuquerque, which manager Davey Johnson
hypothesized over the weekend, don't expect the left-hander to go
quietly . . . if at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want me to go there, I'll talk to my agent and see
what we can do,'' Perez said after throwing a bullpen session prior
to Monday's home game with Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Perez has said he would welcome a trade if it came to that. He's
2-10 with a 7.43 ERA and said he can stomach being sent to the
bullpen to work out his problems, but he can't take being sent to
the minors. The Dodgers need to create a roster spot for Robinson
Checo, who will start in Perez's place Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm not going to be happy about that,'' Perez said about
a possible demotion. ``It doesn't matter if I go to the bullpen and
work it out. That's different. I can still finish the season here.
I'm not going to be happy if I go to Triple-A.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone acknowledged Perez could be
demoted, but that was only one option (another being Jamie Arnold
sent down). Malone said the decision was a few days away. Perez,
who signed a three-year, $15.5 million contract during the
offseason, points to 41/3 innings of one-run ball he pitched in his
only relief appearance as how he could cure his ills and remain in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they let me pitch in the pen, I know I can do better,''
Perez said. ``I've never been a reliever before, but I know I can
get it back there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The E.Y. Chronicles: Second baseman Eric Young said he wants
to go on the disabled list, but management is balking at the idea,
saying if Young was healthy enough to play a doubleheader Thursday
and start Friday in Arizona, how could he be ailing?
</P>
<P>
   ``If my body is going to heal completely, the 15-day disabled
list will let it heal completely,'' said Young, who's missed games
because of ankle, calf and hamstring injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers don't want to put Young on the disabled list because
players on that list can't be traded. The nonwaiver trading
deadline is Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Young, struggling on both offense and defense, lost his starting
spot over the weekend in Arizona. He said that's because of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   However, Malone and Johnson said that's not the direction the
Dodgers want to go because they think Young can be healthy again in
less time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you're on the disabled list, you're out for 15 days,''
Malone said. ``We'll see where it is after six or seven days and
take it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ This and that: The Reds placed pitcher Steve Avery (strained
left shoulder) on the disabled list and activated lefty B.J. Ryan
before the game. . . . Dodgers team physician Dr. Frank Jobe said
reliever Antonio Osuna (elbow) is in search of a second opinion
before deciding to undergo Tommy John surgery. . . . Dodgers Hall
of Fame announcer Jaime Jarrin was honored before the game for the
one-year anniversary of his induction into Cooperstown. He threw
out the first pitch.

UTILITIES ISSUE CAUTIONS ABOUT ELECTRICITY USE 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Unrelenting heat pushed electricity
consumption to an all-time high for Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co.
on Monday, and the utility asked customers to reduce their usage
for the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   For the ninth-straight day, the high temperature in Kansas City
registered in the 90s, and even hit 100 for the first time since
1991 at Kansas City International Airport. Even though the rain
forecast for today could break that streak, hotter weather is
expected later this week _ a threat that officials at KCP&AMP;L are
taking seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Levetzow, a spokeswoman for the utility, said the record
demand was met without brownouts. Nonetheless, predictions of more
hot weather and tighter supplies of wholesale electricity in the
region spurred the utility to request conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a potential for greater concern,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The demand by KCP&AMP;L customers on Monday reached 3,227 megawatts
between 3 and 4 p.m. The previous hourly record was 3,175 megawatts
last Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Kansas City said they think that heat advisories,
issued daily in the area since the July 4 weekend, are saving
lives. No heat-related deaths have been reported since the latest
wave began, but a 65-year-old Kansas City man died July 8 and an
81-year-old Lee's Summit woman died a day later from heat exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger immediate concern, said state utility regulators, is
the soaring demand for electricity. Consumption has put constraints
on the wholesale electric market, where utilities routinely sell
excess power to one another to help meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   So far demand is being met, but ``everything is tight,'' said
Bill Washburn, manager of the electric department at the Missouri
Public Service Commission in Jefferson City.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L is asking customers to cut consumption between 2 and 8
p.m. by setting air conditioners at 82 degrees, not running large
appliances such as dishwashers and clothes dryers during the heat
of the day, and turning off unnecessary lighting and electrical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Public Service, the Raytown utility with about 200,000
customers in western Missouri, said it was meeting demand. But it
reminded customers of ways to reduce usage, such as taking showers,
cooking only during the early morning and late evening, and raising
the thermostat.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L's large commercial and industrial customers with
interruptible contracts already have reduced consumption. Those
contracts give utility customers cheaper rates when they agree to
reduce use at the utility's request.
</P>
<P>
   All of KCP&AMP;L's plants are running except Hawthorn 5, which was
put out of commission earlier this year by an explosion. The
utility is buying electricity on the wholesale market to help
replace the power that would have been provided by Hawthorn 5.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Kan., the Board of Public Utilities said it was
able to meet Monday's demand, despite a fire last week at its
largest power plant, which had prompted appeals for conservation.
The request remains in effect, said Don Denney, a BPU spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The BPU also got some good news when it was told that a
temporary elevator would be in place by Aug. 16 that would deliver
enough coal to bring the fire-damaged Nearman plant up to 25
percent of its capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Western Resources, which operates KPL and KGE in Kansas, said
Monday that all of its plants were running and that it was able to
meet demand; neither utility set a record for electricity use
Monday. Spokesman George Norton said Western always encourages
customers to conserve and was not yet calling for voluntary cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Such appeals by utilities must be issued with a caveat, said a
health official in Cincinnati, where seven persons died of
heat-related illnesses over the weekend _ including a woman who had
turned off her air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The utility companies always stress power conservation, but we
need to be more careful about issuing that to the public,'' said
Malcom Adcock, commissioner of the Cincinnati Department of Health.
The woman who turned off her air conditioning, Adcock said, was
either trying to save power or save on her utility bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't turn off your air conditioning if you are elderly or
have a health problem,'' Adcock said. ``Most of us don't think of
the heat as being life-threatening. It can very well be.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the temperatures in Kansas City, the Metropolitan
Ambulance Services Trust reports no unusual upswing in runs. In
addition, area hospitals have not reported increases in
heat-related illnesses. And none of the area's eight heat shelters
has opened yet because, even though it has been hot, it hasn't been
hot enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know why we've been so lucky, except maybe we've
learned,'' said Dan Lindholm, chairman of the Kansas City Area Heat
Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 weather was blamed in the deaths of 148 Kansas Citians
when ovenlike heat blanketed the city with 100-degree temperatures
for more than two weeks. That same year, a study of heat-related
deaths was released by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC encouraged cities to coordinate agencies and approach
the heat the same way as any other disaster. The study also
determined that fans alone in 100-degree heat might actually
increase body heat.
</P>
<P>
   Air-conditioned shelters were needed for those who didn't have
it.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City created a plan that same year, Lindholm said. Today
the Heat Task Force is made up of 16 area agencies, including the
Red Cross, police and fire departments and public utilities. The
group has met once this year to talk about preparations, Lindholm
said. ``But we're watching the forecasts this week closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight cooling shelters are ready to be opened if a heat alert is
issued, he said. So far this summer Kansas City has not issued any
heat alerts.
</P>
<P>
   Heat alerts are issued when the heat index reaches 105 degrees
or hotter by 11 a.m. The heat index is a measure combining heat and
humidity, gauging more accurately what the weather actually feels
like.
</P>
<P>
   The task force wants people to know that public libraries are
available for people to escape the heat during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have four homeless shelters where people can go during
the hottest parts of the day to get some relief from the heat,''
Lindholm said.

LACK OF TICKETING HAS ANTI-SMOKERS FUMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles fire inspectors, recently assigned to
enforce the 18-month-old statewide ban on workplace smoking, have
visited more than 80 bars in the past three weeks and found several
smokers _ but issued no tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors said they are trying a more educational approach
to their job, rather than busting violators and slapping them with
$81 fines, especially since the enforcement program has just
started.
</P>
<P>
   That soft approach has Mayor Richard Riordan's support, but it
is not what the City Council had in mind when it approved the
$250,000 enforcement program, said Councilwoman Laura Chick, Public
Safety Committee chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not pleased with what I'm hearing,'' Chick said. ``The
Fire Department presented, along with the city attorney, to the
City Council an enforcement program, not an education program.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire Capt. Mark Gozawa, who supervises the program, said the
inspectors were not instructed to refrain from issuing tickets but
rather to judge each case on its merits. If someone is defiant or a
repeat offender, they should get a ticket, he said, but in other
cases the inspectors should use their discretion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to meet the spirit of the law _ which is trying
to get a smoke-free workplace, not to see how many tickets we can
write,'' Gozawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Chick said such direction is at odds with the council's intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not what they have been directed to do,'' replied
Chick. ``This is about enforcing the law. They are supposed to be
going out and enforcing the law. Those are the instructions they
received from the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Chick's office called the Fire Department recently to register a
complaint, but she has not yet received a response.
</P>
<P>
   Gozawa said there are no changes planned in how the department
conducts its inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he agrees with the inspectors' approach because the
city is just starting to enforce the smoking law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you have quality-of-life crimes, sometimes you're
better off to first educate the public on it and warn them you're
going to be ticketing them after a certain period of time, but to
jump right in I think is not good government,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide ban on smoking in bars and restaurants took effect
18 months ago, although the city's enforcement had been spotty
because it lacked a formal enforcement program and policy. To
address that problem, the City Council recently authorized the Fire
Department to assign two full-time inspectors and a clerk to
smoking enforcement starting July1, saying it was long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors can levy fines of $81 to a smoker on a first time
offense, which doubles on the second offense and doubles again on
the third. Businesses can be fined $100 at first, and then as high
as $7,000 for numerous offenses, at which time the California
Occupational Safety and Health Administration can get involved
because the ban is considered a workplace health issue.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, uniformed fire inspector Brian Jones and
his temporary partner, Luis Jaramillo, visited at least four bars
and restaurants in the San Fernando Valley. Each bar was chosen
because of past complaints received from customers before the city
had a formal enforcement program.
</P>
<P>
   A boisterous customer greeted them warmly as soon as they walked
in _ at first joking, ``Hey, you got a light?'' and then
high-fiving them as he declared, ``These guys are my heroes!''
</P>
<P>
   The customer, Chris Vandoli of Palmdale and his wife, Sherri,
said they are happy to see the inspectors and choose to come to
this particular bar in North Hollywood because it usually enforces
the smoking ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't smoke, so we're glad it's illegal,'' Sherri Vandoli
said. ``That's why we come here.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a bar in suburban Sherman Oaks, Jones caught a woman
smoking at the bar near the front door. And at a Woodland Hills
restaurant, he saw a trio of smokers sitting at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, he let off the smokers and the bartenders with
just a warning, even though they acknowledged they knew smoking
there was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to go to the places and educate the general public and
the owners as to what has to be done to avoid them getting cited,''
Jones said. ``We're not looking, like the CHP, to have 50 tickets
written in an eight-hour day.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and his partner visit Los Angeles bars and restaurants two
nights a week, and visit offices and warehouses two days a week.
With some 3,000 bars and restaurants, they know they can't possibly
visit them all _ especially since they always travel together _ so
they only respond to complaints, some more than 6 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, Jones' approach to smokers and bartenders is fairly
affable and straightforward. When he saw the three smokers in
Woodland Hills, he told them, ``Are you guys from California? You
should know better. You have to put those out _ otherwise we have
to write you a ticket right now.''
</P>
<P>
   They snuff out the butts and then listen to the polite lecture
that Johnson finds himself giving several times a night. He informs
them about the hefty fines they could be subject to, but this time
he is letting them go with a warning.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Although they aren't happy, by the end of the talk they thank
him for not issuing fines and move to the restaurant's outside
terrace to continue smoking where it is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The three smokers complied with the inspectors but said they
think the state's smoking law goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like this Big Brother thing,'' said Jackie Ketcham, a
hotel supervisor from Hermosa Beach. ``They're telling you you
can't do this, you can't do that. It's getting out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have stronger words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's absolutely disgusting,'' said Pat Clark, the
woman who was caught smoking in Sherman Oaks. A Beverly Hills
Realtor, Clark put out her cigarette at Jones' request but argued
with him for some time instead of listening to his lecture quietly.
</P>
<P>
   She told him it didn't seem fair that California has such strong
restrictions when no other state does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go stand outside and have a cigarette,'' she
told Jones. ``Why don't we do it nationwide?''
</P>
<P>
   To which Jones had a quick reply: ``You know what? New York is
coming out here next week. They want to see how the program
works.''
</P>
<P>
   The smoking ban, in effect for the workplace since 1995 but
expanded to bars and restaurants in January 1998, has been enforced
to varying levels in different cities throughout California.
</P>
<P>
   While Los Angeles and San Francisco have been slower to dedicate
resources to the ban, San Diego has been more aggressive, sending
undercover police into bars to ticket smokers and bar owners, and
referring cases to the City Attorney's Office for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the San Diego police issued 134 citations to smokers,
according to the City Attorney's Office. Of those, 101 either
pleaded guilty or were found guilty, while 28 people failed to
appear in court and therefore have warrants outstanding for their
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the San Diego police have issued more than 70 smoking
citations, according to Detective James Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   He said they try to take a discreet approach: They'll hang out
in plainclothes in a bar for a little while, and when they see
someone smoking they will approach them and quietly show their
badges and ask the person to step outside. They always travel in
teams, just in case a drunken patron decides to get rowdy.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett said it is rare for the vice detectives to let people
off with a warning if they catch them smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law went into effect in January of 1998, so it's been over
a year and a half,'' Jarrett said. ``It's been a very publicized
law, so we pretty much allowed a 30-day grace period and then
started enforcing back in February of 1998. There were no warnings
at that time _ we just basically began citing folks.''

ADVERSITY MAKES BORBON BETTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Cincinnati Reds are in town, which means you
walk into the Los Angeles Dodgers clubhouse and make a beeline for
Pedro Borbon Jr.'s locker. You're sure the story you'll find is as
plain as the laminated baseball card resting among the relief
pitcher's personal articles, between his shaving kit and his mitt.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon's father, Pedro Sr., pitched for Cincinnati in the 1970s,
the Reds' decade of riches.
</P>
<P>
   On the mound, Borbon is his father's son, right down to his
fierce focus. So you feel like a batter after whiffing one of
Borbon's impeccably placed fastballs when he tells you the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about blood being thicker than the water in the Ohio
River. In the case of the Borbons, it's barely thick enough to clot
an open wound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk every four or five months,'' Pedro Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   The conversations don't reveal much. Neither one, he said, dares
to delve beneath the now-tranquil surface of their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of fuel there,'' Pedro Jr. said. ``We don't want
to put a match to it because it'll explode. So we talk like we just
talked yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Sr. called the Dodgers clubhouse three weeks ago. It was
the first time he had spoken with his 31-year-old son since Pedro
Jr. made the Dodgers as a nonroster invitee and became the
feel-good story in the franchise's otherwise forgettable season.
</P>
<P>
   After his two-batter stint on Monday, he has a team-best
earned-run average of 1.85 in 39 innings. He has been an unsolvable
mystery to lefties, who are batting .118 against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take pride in my job,'' Borbon said. ``I respect hitters,
but I fear no one. After everything I've been through, I'm just
numb to the feeling of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Borbon's childhood was cut short at the age of 13 by his
parents' divorce. Many times since then he has looked back on his
preteen years and wondered if it wasn't all just his imagination:
the long summers spent hanging out at Riverfront Stadium with Ken
Griffey Jr. and Pete Rose Jr., of being spoiled by his father, of
living ``la dolce vita'' in his native Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the divorce, my dad was so mentally messed up,'' said
Borbon, who had no contact with his father between the ages of 13
and 20. ``He felt like a failure. So he kind of disappeared from my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Borbon's voice betrays no bitterness, no pity. ``I don't carry a
grudge,'' he said. ``If that would not have happened, I'd probably
be a spoiled brat. I would have grown up thinking my dad was going
to take care of me my whole life because he's rich. It was only
when I realized the money wasn't there that I started to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Albeit too fast. At 14, Pedro Jr. left home and settled in New
York with a couple of his mother's brothers. It was an uneasy
alliance with his uncles from the start. They did not believe
education was essential, so they encouraged Borbon to quit school,
get a job and earn his keep.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't, but his heart wasn't in his classes. In the spring of
his freshman year, Borbon cut class, heading for the lunch room. He
was stopped by a security guard, who asked to see his student ID.
The guard did a double-take when he saw the name. ``Are you related
to Pedro Borbon, the pitcher?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The guard also happened to be a baseball coach at the school. He
asked Borbon if he played baseball and refused to take ``no'' for
an answer. He took Borbon outside and had him throw 20 pitches. By
Borbon's recollection, 18 were strikes.
</P>
<P>
   And that's how Borbon came to play organized baseball. He had
his father to thank in only the most peripheral of ways.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon pitched well enough to earn an athletic scholarship to
Ranger Junior College outside Houston but not before parting with
his uncles and living for a while in New York City's ugly
underbelly. He eventually took an awful apartment in the Bronx with
two high school buddies that cost them $540 a month. He worked as a
messenger after school to pay his third of the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Borbon shred the medial collateral ligament in his
left elbow while pitching for Atlanta in August of 1996, he had
gotten the message that life can be hard.
</P>
<P>
   The injury, which came less than a year after he pitched for
Atlanta in the World Series, brought with it new trials. Borbon got
to feeling so sorry for himself, he forgot about his wife Staci.
They separated last year, while he was trekking through the minors
on his comeback tour.
</P>
<P>
   The son, without realizing it, had become his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I created a lot of chaos within my family,'' Borbon said. ``I
kind of shut down my relationship with everybody. I felt like a
failure. I felt like I had lost everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day proves him wrong. His arm is all the way back and he
hasn't given up hope of a reconciliation with Staci, who lives in
Houston with the couple's two young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injury made me a better man,'' Borbon said. ``That's why I
think I'm having such a good year. I don't stress out as much as I
did before. Now everything in my life is coming together.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: ARMSTRONGS EMBODY OUR HEART AND SPIRIT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 10th graf to fix Neil Armstrong quote)  (ms) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``From this Tour de France, we asked for the moon; it gave us
Armstrong,'' wrote the French journalist Claude Droussent, in this
week's issue of L'Equipe magazine. He referred, of course, to Lance
Armstrong, the heart-emboldening and heartbreaking winner of the
world's great bike race, completed Sunday afternoon in Paris, under
the shading trees along the Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moon, in this month of July 1999,'' added Droussent,
``would have been a Tour freed of its doubts and suspicions if not
all doping.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, 30 years ago this month, Earth, in effect, asked for
the Moon, too, and it also gave us Armstrong. That is, Neil
Armstrong, the first man to walk _ or hop about, as it were _ on
our mystical and mysterious rock and metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   Underlining the achievements of each of these strong-minded
Armstrongs was something beyond the science of NASA and the
technology of Lance Armstrong's two-wheeler. It was something
beyond the dark but starry 250,000-mile distance from Cape
Canaveral to the Sea of Tranquillity that Armstrong's Apollo
capsule traveled, and it was something over and above the
three-week, 2,290-mile journey from Le Puy du Fou to Paris, from
the French Alps to the River Seine.
</P>
<P>
   There was the crossing, or exceeding, or simply the stretching
of the indeterminate boundaries of the human mind and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Armstrong, along with his crew, didn't know if he would
return from the Moon _ or get there at all without drifting off
forever into space. Was this curtains?
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong also faced the distinct possibility of death.
Three years ago, at age 25, he was found to have an especially
lethal variety of testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs
and abdomen and brain. He underwent surgery to remove the tumors
and lesions, and doctors gave him no more than a 50 percent chance
of survival. After intense chemotherapy, and still riding his
bicycle 30 to 50 miles a day, the cancer disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``A miracle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other people have recovered from the kind of cancer he had _ he
is cancer free now, with only a 2 percent chance of it coming back
_ but they don't throw themselves into the kind of exhaustive
physical activity that Lance Armstrong has. As Dr. Lawrence
Einhorn, the oncologist who supervised Armstrong's treatment, said,
such survivors may go back to work behind desks, but not behind
handlebars.
</P>
<P>
   When first stepping space boot onto the bald surface of the
Moon, on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong said famously, ``That's one
small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.'' He spoke of the
breaking of barriers of what was heretofore deemed implausible, if
not impossible. And opened up new avenues of the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong broke barriers, too. He seemed to put to rest
talk that he had taken performance-enhancing drugs _ such scandals
had marred that race and other cycling races in previous years _
when it was determined that medication he had used was for
treatment of his cancerous condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of talk, it makes me sick,'' he said of the drug
rumors. ``But when the race is over, that stuff doesn't live. The
victory and the people that I touch and the story that I can tell _
that lives. I'm proud to be a cancer survivor and I'm proud to do
this, I really am. This race and my performance here are going to
affect a lot of people in a positive way, in a wonderful, fantastic
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Having lived with the devastation of cancer in my own immediate
family, the idea of hope _ as remote as it may sometimes seem _ and
symbolized in Armstrong's spectacular accomplishment, cannot be
minimized.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there are miracles, sometimes not. I interviewed Neil
Armstrong some 10 years after his Moon walk. He said he was
disappointed that mankind seemed no more united after the Moon
landing than before. ``I had hoped the Moon shot would take our
minds away from the more mundane and temporal problems that have
face us,'' he told me. ``But we still appear to be tied up with
today's problems.'' However, Lance Armstrong's message exactly 30
years and 5 days after Neil Armstrong's is that we must keep
trying. Lance Armstrong's message is that there is the decided
possibility that mind _ and heart _ can win out over pure matter.
</P>
<P>
   After Lance Armstrong's race was won, he was checked for
unsuitable properties. When Neil Armstrong returned to Earth, he
was quarantined for possibly carrying lunar germs. Both were
cleared, and have entered the pantheon of honored conceivability,
of, by courage and pluck, making dreams come true. &QL;

WOMEN PLAYING SOCCER FOR THE LOVE OF A GAME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 16th graf to correct spelling of Dyckman Park)  (ms) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were career professionals who were also soccer
moms, sideline boosters content to watch smaller versions of
themselves scurrying about soccer fields. They did not fit the
profile of the typical frustrated jock.
</P>
<P>
   Yet every time they helped their children don their jerseys and
strap on shinguards or watched them score a goal and beam in joyous
celebration, the more consumed they were with a desire to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always proud to watch my two sons play soccer,'' said
Joan Madden-Peister, a state Supreme Court judge whose sons, Evan,
18, and Kyle, 14, play in a youth league in the city. ``One day, I
realized I wanted to get a soccer ball and I wanted to have a
uniform and I wanted to score goals. I never had that opportunity
when I was growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, she was not alone.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Madden-Peister and her teammates on the Parlour Moms,
a recreational women's team she helped found three years ago, will
travel to Ireland to play four amateur women's teams in Dublin and
Galway. Their first match is Saturday against the Irish Allied Bank
team. Three more games will be played next week against opponents
they know little about, except that the team in Galway is known as
Castle Celtic.
</P>
<P>
   And after the tournament, there will be no news-media frenzy or
promotional trips to Disneyland for the Americans, as there were
for the U.S. women's team that won the World Cup two weeks ago.
There's nothing more at stake than bragging rights over beer and,
perhaps, a shared sense of personal satisfaction for a group of
women who have come to discover that it is never to late to score a
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little scared, but this will be fun,'' said Jane
Kenney, a magazine editor who is leaving the children behind with
her husband, John.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament was arranged by Maggie Bradley-Cook, a physical
therapist and mother of two soccer-playing teen-agers, after she
was feeling a bit jealous last summer that her 13-year-old daughter
got to play soccer in Sweden and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself: `What's this? Our kids get these
opportunities and we sacrifice,''' Bradley-Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   The Parlour Moms were formed after a youth soccer dinner, when
Madden-Peister had a sign-up sheet asking if there might be other
women interested in playing. More than 100 women signed up.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the days before the U.S. women's national team,
mostly pony-tailed and unified in team spirit, put the sport into
the national spotlight. Through attrition _ injuries, frustration,
other responsibilities _ nearly 60 dropped out. What was left was a
ragtag team that became known as the Parlour Moms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly invigorating,'' said Wendy Hollender, 44, a
home-furnishing designer who continued to play during recent
chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer. ``I see some of my
neighbors walking around half asleep, and I'm coming in after
playing two hours and my adrenaline is pumping.''
</P>
<P>
   The team plays under the auspices of the Bronx Irish League.
Started 10 years ago by newly arrived Irish immigrants, the adult
recreational league sponsors interleague play between teams from
Queens, the Bronx and the only Manhattan-based team, the Parlour
Moms. The name was taken from The Parlour, the Irish pub and
restaurant on the Upper West Side, where members of the team
gathered on Monday and Thursday evenings after practice at Turf
Soccer Field in Riverside Park.
</P>
<P>
   Only nine of the Parlour Moms will be making the trip to
Ireland. Among the missing will be the team's three goalies. To
bolster their roster and their chances of winning, the team
recruited players from a rival team, the Harps, this season's Bronx
Irish league champions. They are younger and more skilled players.
</P>
<P>
   Katie McNeil, an architect, who plays defense for the Harps,
learned that the Parlour Moms were looking for volunteers to make
the trip to Ireland. She changed her vacation plans and persuaded
Karen Rice, a forward, Allison Kaye, who played for Dartmouth
College, and Hillary Potkewitz, a central midfielder, to put aside
interleague rivalry and become a Parlour Mom, even though all four
are single and childless.
</P>
<P>
   The Parlour Moms know they will have to play their best to wrest
a victory from their Irish opponents. For one thing, the teams in
Ireland play regulation 90-minute games, as opposed to the
70-minute games in the Bronx Irish League. In addition, the fields
are expected to be bigger than the ones at Van Cortlandt and
Dyckman Parks and those on Randalls Island where the Parlour Moms
play on Saturday afternoons. And, the amateur leagues in Ireland
are said to be highly organized and the players far more
experienced than their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday evening, John Kelly, co-owner of the Parlour, was
standing on the sideline of Turf Field watching the team practice
and reminiscing about the women in the knee-high socks, T-shirts
and shorts, who dragged themselves into his bar one evening two
years ago shortly after it opened and commiserated about how
terrible they were as players. One year later, with Kelly as their
sponsor, the team won the league's championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude has completely changed,'' Kelly said. Asked in
what way, he replied, ``Oh, they're cutthroat.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley-Cook, a tall, athletic-type who played basketball in
high school and finished the 1979 New York City marathon in 4 hours
4 minutes, said that she and the other women on the team _ which
has an average age of 45 _ have no illusions about the level of
their game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we felt eager to ingratiate whatever experience we could
create for ourselves,'' she said. ``I'm 50 years old. It doesn't
seem like a valid thing to seem so important to me because it seems
very selfish and separate from my family and my work. But it's
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The players say that soccer has become their saving grace.
</P>
<P>
   Hollender said she might have let cancer get the better of her.
As a soccer player, however, she is used ``to taking blows and the
aches and pains.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After I had my surgery, once the anesthesia wore off, I
climbed off the table and was ready to go,'' said Hollender, the
speedy striker who credits her teammates with helping her maintain
her psyche throughout her chemotherapy treatments. ``Heck, I was
bruised up more on the soccer field. Instead of focusing on the
cancer and living in fear, my question to my doctor was when could
I play soccer again.''
</P>
<P>
   By their own admission, they will never play as well as their
children. But at least they will know what it feels like to use
your head to block a shot or to catch a pass on the inside of your
foot, then kick it to another woman streaking down the field, who
steadies it for a moment and sends it sailing toward the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all we need are ponytails,'' Bradley-Cook said.

KING TO FACE TENNIS ROYALTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Phillip King discovered he had a solid chance
of earning a wild-card entry into the Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA, he
was excited. Then he discovered the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called (an event official) and asked, `Who do I play?' ''
said King, a 17-year-old Long Beach resident and top junior player
in the country. ``He said, `Sampras.' I said, `Ha ha ha.' He said,
`No, you really do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Can I give the wild card back?' '' said King's
coach, Eliot Teltscher.
</P>
<P>
   It's true. King plays in the first round tonight at 7:30 against
second-seeded Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   King, who won the prestigious Easter Bowl tournament this
spring, earned the opportunity by being the last name to come out
of the draw on Friday. Instead of being intimidated, King has been
relaxed about his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just trying to be myself,'' the baseliner said. ``Hopefully,
I'll just go out and play my best effort.''
</P>
<P>
   He has two things going for him. King has hit with Sampras at
Riviera. Plus, the last time Sampras played a 17-year-old, Xavier
Malaisse took him to 7-5 in the third set in Philadelphia last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras also remembers what it's like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember playing (Ivan) Lendl and (John) McEnroe the first
time,'' he said. ``It's intimidating. You grow up watching these
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Paying homage: The tournament is honoring Rod Laver, who won
titles here in 1968 and '70. Sampras and Agassi spoke reverently
about the Australian legend who is one of the few to win two of the
four Grand Slam tournaments in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a player who was complete,'' Sampras said. ``He played
well in all surfaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi added: ``Most players feel the same way Pete does. Rod
has impacted the game like no other. To me, his record is
phenomenal. He's the man in the game of tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Back home: Justin Gimelstob loves UCLA. As a Bruin, he led
UCLA to the NCAA team final against Stanford in 1996. Last year as
a pro, he reached the semifinal here.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he started with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over 18-year-old
Taylor Dent, a wild-card qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being in L.A.,'' Gimelstob said. ``I love that court. I
get my friends to support me.'' One such friend was his former UCLA
teammate, Jean-Noel Grinda. The native of France is taking
summer-school classes, so he figured watching the matches would be
fun, especially considering Grinda has faced several of the
participants in junior tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   One such player is Australian James Sekulov, a qualifier who
beat Martin Damm of the Czech Republic on Monday. Sekulov was the
second seed at the U.S. Open juniors and Grinda beat him.
</P>
<P>
   __ Night at the Net: Agassi and Sampras participated with Robin
Williams and Billy Crystal in a fund-raiser for MusiCares, the
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences' charity.
</P>
<P>
   The quips flew faster than the balls Sampras and Agassi hit. A
sampling:
</P>
<P>
   After Williams shows his leg, Crystal said, ``Did you wax?''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, frustrated that his partner, Crystal, kept hitting the
ball at Sampras: ``Six Wimbledons! Hit it to Robin!''
</P>
<P>
   Country singer Clint Black, who sang two songs: ``I've never
opened up for a tennis match. I've got to give credit to my
manager. In the past, I've opened up for Ping-Pong matches.''

VALDES IS GOOD, DODGERS ARE NOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ismael Valdes pitched under the watchful eye of
every contending team in baseball Monday, and he did what he's been
doing most of the season. The Los Angeles Dodgers' most marketable
commodity allowed one run in seven innings in shutting down
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   It still wasn't good enough for the win because closer Jeff Shaw
allowed two runs in the ninth and two in the 10th as the Reds
rallied for a 5-3 win at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It's was Shaw's second blown save in 24 chances and the second
time in 41 games the Dodgers lost when leading after eight innings.
Shaw (2-3) allowed four runs on five hits in two innings.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dodgers an out away from a win in the ninth,
pinch-hitter Eddie Taubensee doubled to the center-field wall to
drive in two runs and tie the score 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Young led off the 10th with a double to right. Shaw
struck out Sean Casey and Greg Vaughn's infield single moved Young
to third before Barry Larkin hit a sacrifice fly to center. Vaughn
stole second and then scored on Aaron Boone's single to make it
5-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' inning further deteriorated when Boone stole second
and went to third on catcher Todd Hundley's errant throw. Hundley
committed his second error of the inning when he dropped Mike
Cameron's foul pop.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the way the Dodgers' season has gone. Whether Valdes
remains entrenched depends on the organization's brain trust, and
whether they're willing to risk dealing one of the best young
pitchers in baseball for prospects that could help the organization
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone said over the weekend that, at the
very least, it had to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains of whether the Dodgers are willing to
deal a guy that's 25 years old and has been the team's most
consistent pitcher. It may also signal the Dodgers could be ready
to pack up the season and look toward next year.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, if the Dodgers were ready to look forward, they
would be hard-pressed to find a pitcher of Valdes' level and talent
on the free-agent market or through a trade.
</P>
<P>
   And though Malone and manager Davey Johnson each acknowledged
moving one of the starting pitchers is possible before Saturday's
non-waiver trade deadline, it still appears unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes has been strong lately, though he suffered through a
career-high five-game losing streak in June primarily because the
Dodgers gave him little run support.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes gave up five earned runs in his last start, his worst
outing of the season. He had yielded two runs in his three starts
before that, all of which he won. In his last five starts Valdes
has allowed eight runs in 35 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield had two hits and drove in two runs for the
Dodgers and Devon White hit a solo homer. The Dodgers (44-55) could
have jumped out of last place with a win.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Reds' Stan Belinda (2-1) recorded the win in
relief.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the first when Jose
Vizcaino scored on Sheffield's double.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds tied it in the fourth on Casey's leadoff homer, but
White countered with a solo shot in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who threw out Jason LaRue at the plate in the
seventh, singled in the eighth to give the Dodgers a 3-1 lead.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Last week many Americans indulged in an orgy of
grief. Ostensibly, they were mourning John F. Kennedy Jr. Yet
people seemed to be lamenting not only the inexplicable demise of a
Diana-like celebrity. They were also grieving for the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The initial shock at the news of the lost plane gave way to a
week-long televised ritual, far too familiar to everyone over the
age of 45.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters were compelled, whatever their political
inclinations, to replay the most heartbreaking disasters of the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   First came the question of whether the hero could survive the
calamity _ whether, as in this case, the impact of an airplane
crash or, in an earlier age, a bullet to the brain. That was
followed by a national wake, with eulogies by pundits and friends.
</P>
<P>
   If memories of the 1960s had in any way dimmed, the networks and
cable channels resurrected the visual symbolism of the decade's
death watches.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers could relive the funeral processions of President John
F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., or stare again at the
picture of Robert Kennedy sprawled in a pool of his own blood on
the kitchen floor of a Los Angeles hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the images of horror, this was a week in which
the various meanings attributed to the 1960s collided.
</P>
<P>
   The week began not with another Kennedy family tragedy, but with
a remembrance of the first landing of men on the moon in 1969, a
feat that was one of President Kennedy's most enduring legacies.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the week, the myth of Camelot was ubiquitous _ a time
presumably full of promise, presided over by a man whose wit,
urbanity and ironic sensibility made him seem less conventionally
American than a citizen of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the week, it was possible to recall a
different 1960s. Friday was not only the occasion of the memorial
service for John F. Kennedy Jr. It was also the 30th anniversary of
Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   Television newscasts showed the clash of symbols that marked the
decade's confident beginning and its convulsive end.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief glimpse of Robert McNamara, the former U.S.
defense secretary, leaving the service, followed by clips from the
movie version of Woodstock. On television, at least, the last
surviving members of the best and the brightest were meeting the
remnants of the counterculture and the anti-war movement.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone shared in the nostalgia for Camelot or Woodstock.
There was an undercurrent of resentment toward the extravagant TV
coverage of the Kennedys, past and present.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the anger was ideological, with conservatives objecting
to the idealization of a family and a decade whose values they had
been trying for 30 years to repel.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of the exasperation was generational. On talk radio,
people in their 20s or 30s voiced complaints that they had no
emotional connections to John F. Kennedy Jr., his father or the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   For people outside the United States, the attention paid to the
death of another Kennedy might have seemed narcissistic. The
upheavals of the 1960s were global, not exclusively American.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam was as much a home of the counterculture as was San
Francisco. The rebellions in Paris, Berlin, Mexico City and Prague
in 1968 were as significant as the anti-war demonstrations in
Berkeley or Boston.
</P>
<P>
   America may have been the epicenter of the political and
cultural earthquakes of the 1960s, but the aftershocks were felt
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that decade haunts many middle-aged Americans. They feel

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Last week many Americans indulged in an orgy of
grief. Ostensibly, they were mourning John F. Kennedy Jr. Yet
people seemed to be lamenting not only the inexplicable demise of a
Diana-like celebrity. They were also grieving for the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The initial shock at the news of the lost plane gave way to a
week-long televised ritual, far too familiar to everyone over the
age of 45.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters were compelled, whatever their political
inclinations, to replay the most heartbreaking disasters of the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   First came the question of whether the hero could survive the
calamity _ whether, as in this case, the impact of an airplane
crash or, in an earlier age, a bullet to the brain. That was
followed by a national wake, with eulogies by pundits and friends.
</P>
<P>
   If memories of the 1960s had in any way dimmed, the networks and
cable channels resurrected the visual symbolism of the decade's
death watches.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers could relive the funeral processions of President John
F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., or stare again at the
picture of Robert Kennedy sprawled in a pool of his own blood on
the kitchen floor of a Los Angeles hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the images of horror, this was a week in which
the various meanings attributed to the 1960s collided.
</P>
<P>
   The week began not with another Kennedy family tragedy, but with
a remembrance of the first landing of men on the moon in 1969, a
feat that was one of President Kennedy's most enduring legacies.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the week, the myth of Camelot was ubiquitous _ a time
presumably full of promise, presided over by a man whose wit,
urbanity and ironic sensibility made him seem less conventionally
American than a citizen of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the week, it was possible to recall a
different 1960s. Friday was not only the occasion of the memorial
service for John F. Kennedy Jr. It was also the 30th anniversary of
Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   Television newscasts showed the clash of symbols that marked the
decade's confident beginning and its convulsive end.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief glimpse of Robert McNamara, the former U.S.
defense secretary, leaving the service, followed by clips from the
movie version of Woodstock. On television, at least, the last
surviving members of the best and the brightest were meeting the
remnants of the counterculture and the anti-war movement.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone shared in the nostalgia for Camelot or Woodstock.
There was an undercurrent of resentment toward the extravagant TV
coverage of the Kennedys, past and present.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the anger was ideological, with conservatives objecting
to the idealization of a family and a decade whose values they had
been trying for 30 years to repel.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of the exasperation was generational. On talk radio,
people in their 20s or 30s voiced complaints that they had no
emotional connections to John F. Kennedy Jr., his father or the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   For people outside the United States, the attention paid to the
death of another Kennedy might have seemed narcissistic. The
upheavals of the 1960s were global, not exclusively American.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam was as much a home of the counterculture as was San
Francisco. The rebellions in Paris, Berlin, Mexico City and Prague
in 1968 were as significant as the anti-war demonstrations in
Berkeley or Boston.
</P>
<P>
   America may have been the epicenter of the political and
cultural earthquakes of the 1960s, but the aftershocks were felt
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that decade haunts many middle-aged Americans. They feel
stigmatized by the assassinations and by the carnage in Vietnam. In
mourning John F. Kennedy Jr., they were expressing their sadness
for a once innocent, now vanished era of youthful adventure and
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, then, the disparate images of President Kennedy playing
with his 3-year-old son, the moon landing and the festival at
Woodstock were not so jarring after all. &QL;

GRIFFEY, RODRIGUEZ AWAIT CLUES FROM M'S OWNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Butch Huskey was on his way to Boston Monday. The
Mariners traded the outfielder for a minor-league pitcher, helping
add to the deal-making fodder of this so-called important week in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   (As if any team other than the Yankees, Mets, Cleveland or
Atlanta is going to win the World Series.)
</P>
<P>
   Trading deadlines are when clubs splurge or purge to set a tone
for what happens next, and the M's, now 11 games out in the AL
West, certainly have reason to start looking to the future.
</P>
<P>
   The M's need pitching. They don't need any more slow-footed,
big-bat outfielders. So Huskey was a logical place to start with
the Safeco Field-necessitated re-tooling.
</P>
<P>
   But more than Huskey's trip to Beantown, one should look at Ken
Griffey Jr.'s solo trip home to Florida Monday for a visit with his
family to get a truer sense of what the future holds for the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey used the Mariners' off day to charter a flight home
between games in Minneapolis and Kansas City. Now that his son Trey
is starting school in Orlando, Griffey has said getting back home
on off days is a priority.
</P>
<P>
   And judging by the 2,700 miles that separate Seattle from
Orlando, that is a pretty tall order, should the superstar center
fielder wish to remain in a Mariner uniform, as most everyone
wishes he would and as he, deep down in his loyal baseball heart,
knows would be a good thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   What could convince Griffey to sign on the dotted line?
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners know the answer _ or at least a big part of it _
and it's pitching. They have had the answer all year, ever since
Randy Johnson was traded away and the Mariners of 1995 started to
become a distant memory and the M's found no free agent pitcher
they felt was worth the investment.
</P>
<P>
   (They'll say hindsight is treating them favorably. Tim Belcher
is hurt and the Angels were toast. Kevin Brown and his $105 million
haven't done anything for the Dodgers. Johnson did not want to be
here, they say.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Mariners' task of convincing their superstars they
are committed to winning is considerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to sign Ken Griffey Jr. We want to sign Alex
Rodriguez. But they have to want to sign,'' club president Chuck
Armstrong said Monday after another discussion about Griffey's deal
failed to produce an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mariners are willing to pay Griffey and Rodriguez top
dollar, money and length of service are again not the issues _ at
least with Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Griffey and Rodriguez have been adamant
about what it will take to get them to consider sticking around. In
fact, at so many points this season when the Mariners' minor-league
call-ups have been battered, Rodriguez has wondered out loud:
</P>
<P>
   How long can this go on? Can't the Mariners fix this leaking
ship?
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, meanwhile, has scoffed at reports that said he gave
Armstrong a list of teams to which he would accept a trade.
Instead, Griffey tendered a few suggestions about how to improve
the Mariners' travel schedule along with other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But certainly Griffey, like anyone else who has tried to
understand the motives and mechanics of this Mariner franchise, is
frustrated by an ownership that has been so distracted by the new
ballpark financing and politics that the team has been left without
a credible flight plan.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, news broke about how Mariners part owner Howard
Lincoln was going to step down as Nintendo of America chairman
early next year. With Mariners CEO John Ellis hinting about
retirement, speculation is that Lincoln, perhaps along with his
chief confidente confidante and fellow Nintendo executive John
Bauer, will take over running the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to see how this will make much difference in the
way the M's pursue free agents or commit to a championship-caliber
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of asking Woody Woodward, the team's vice president of
baseball operations, or Armstrong or Ellis to go out and take a hit
for the team, the job of breaking unpopular news or changing
direction would fall squarely on the shoulders of the men whose
deep pockets own this club.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Lincoln and his cohorts are tough businessmen. They can
hack it, if they want the job.
</P>
<P>
   But if any of the Mariner owners has the notion that just by
stepping into the day-to-day fray makes the organization more
credible and in better control of its destiny, there could be some
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the same owners. They'll just have different
titles. It doesn't make a difference,'' Rodriguez said Monday. ``I
just have to keep playing hard, play out the year and make my
decision after 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is, it doesn't matter who from this current ownership
is running the Mariners. It doesn't matter how many Butch Huskeys
are traded for minor-league pitching help.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the Mariners' future depends on what kind of rather
grand and perhaps impractical reassurances the club can give to two
of baseball's best players. And up until now, those guys are
putting out vibes that they've been given few reasons to believe.

VALDES IS GOOD, DODGERS ARE NOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers right-hander Ismael Valdes
pitched under watchful eyes of every contending team in baseball,
and he showed why so many teams are interested.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, the Dodgers' most marketable commodity in trade circles,
allowed one run in seven innings in shutting down Cincinnati. In
keeping with the theme of the season, he still didn't win.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, closer Jeff Shaw allowed two runs in the ninth and two
in the 10th as the Reds rallied for a 5-3 victory Monday at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was Shaw's second blown save in 24 chances and the second
time in 41 games the Dodgers lost when leading after eight innings.
Shaw (2-3) allowed four runs on five hits in two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Valdes remains entrenched in such a season depends on
the organization's brain trust and whether they're willing to risk
dealing a bright, young pitcher for prospects or left-handed power
before Saturday's trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed unrealistic until general manager Kevin Malone said
during the weekend that moving one of the Dodgers' young pitchers,
at the very least, had to be considered. Valdes understood the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just might be my last game as a Dodger,'' said Valdes,
who's grown up in the system. ``I love this organization. This
organization is first class.''
</P>
<P>
   So it remains to be seen whether Malone is willing to deal a guy
who's 25-years-old and has been the team's most consistent pitcher.
If so, it might also signal the Dodgers' willingness to begin
looking toward next year.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers were ready to do that, they would be hard-pressed
to find a pitcher of Valdes' level on the free-agent market or
through a trade. They also don't have a replacement in the farm
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not many wins around and we gave this win away,''
Valdes said. ``It's tough to accept that. It's tough to live like
that. It's tough this time of the season when your name is in the
air with trade rumors. It's tough (to deal with), but at the same
time it's not impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes signed with the Dodgers when he was 17 and he said he
wants to remain in the organization. Malone admits a deal for one
of the Dodgers' starting pitchers is unlikely. But the threat is
there and Valdes is handling it well because of experience. He was
nearly dealt to Seattle last season for Randy Johnson
</P>
<P>
   And Valdes has been so good this season he could bring an
intriguing group of prospects. He's 8-8 and is tops among Dodgers
starters with a 3.33 ERA. During a five-game losing streak earlier
in the season, the Dodgers scored 10 runs in his starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of way this year has been going,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said. ``Ismael was himself. He pitched a
great ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The stunning part is how hard Shaw was hit. With the Dodgers an
out away from a win in the ninth, pinch-hitter Eddie Taubensee
doubled to the center-field wall to drive in two runs and tie the
game 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Young led off the 10th with a double to right. Shaw
struck out Sean Casey and Greg Vaughn's infield single moved Young
to third before Larkin's fly ball to center. Vaughn stole second
and then scored on Aaron Boone's single to center to make it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Valdes) pitched a good game and put us in position to win and
the offense put us in position to win,'' Shaw said. ``And I had a
bad night.''

BLACK SOUTH AFRICA FINDS VOICE IN FREEDOM FOLLOWING APARTHEID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: ALSO MOVING IN ``A'' CATEGORY)
 &UR; It was night in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Never had the starry sky seemed so large to Lionel Davies until
that instant in 1964 when he was no longer free.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing at the heavens from his cell on South Africa's Robben
Island, this prisoner of apartheid could see the freedom of the
world reflected in the stars, almost taunting him with their
inaccessibility.
</P>
<P>
   He would be in prison for the next 11 years, put there for the
``crime'' of protesting apartheid, one of hundreds of black people
imprisoned during the 44 years of apartheid rule in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Davies only hoped that one day he would again stand under that
sky as a man equal to the world, and not as a black South African
activist imprisoned by cultural fear.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``We were the pariahs of our world,'' Davies says. ``It was
humiliating to be black at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 25 years later, apartheid has ended, Davies and others have
been released and South Africa's art world is waking from its long
night's sleep of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Davies and the country's other black artists, realizing they're
no longer limited by their country's horizon, are celebrating with
an outpouring of art that is being heralded as an African
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The awakening is evident not only in their own country, but
globally; the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., opened
an exhibit this summer, the first significant exhibit in America
ever to be dedicated solely to South African art. That in itself is
an illustration of the renaissance's scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally destroyed by apartheid and prison,'' says
Davies, now 63. ``But I searched for direction, and I discovered
making art. I learned to paint and to draw, and that transformed my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what the idea of an African renaissance is all about:
the divine human gift of creation and the right of a person,
regardless of color, to share the product of that creation with the
world.
</P>
<P>
   It's about excavating a culture strangled by years of white
colonial rule and nourishing and encouraging the remains.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a country that has always hugged tight to the Cape of
Good Hope, dreaming of discovering itself, finding ''fortitude and
soul in time to accompany the world into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   It was once merely about survival. Now it is about claiming
space. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TODAY'S BUZZWORD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``African renaissance'' has been a buzzword in today's South
Africa since newly inaugurated president Thabo Mbeki and former
president and national hero Nelson Mandela adopted it as a mantra
of their administrations.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted South Africa to experience an economic renaissance,
a rebirth into the global economy. They cited it in their speeches,
formed committees to chronicle it and whispered it into the ears of
their citizens until the idea became national ideology, and it
spread to the art world.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Africans, we are the children of the abyss, who have
sustained a backward march for half a millennium,'' said Mbeki in
his inaugural address June 17. ``We have been a source for human
slaves. Our countries were turned into the patrimony of colonial
powers. We have been victim to our own African predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being certain that not always were we the children of the
abyss, we will do what we have to do to achieve our own
renaissance.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
CELEBRATING FREEDOM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The renaissance's dawn is fragmented and still dim in the far
reaches of the country, parts of which are just now receiving
electricity, paved roads, and other modern standbys.
</P>
<P>
   These settlements, where art is chiefly the beadwork of the
Xhosa tribes (an adopted practice fueled by tourism dollars) or the
brightly painted homes of the Ndebele and Venda tribes, are just
poised to enter this century as the rest of the country prepares
for the next.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in juxtaposition, metropolitan South African cities, such as
Cape Town, Pretoria and Johannesburg (where bars even serve a mixed
drink called the ``African renaissance''), are basking in freedom,
experimentation and a celebration of space.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the end of apartheid is evident in the art community,
where contemporary black art increasingly flows: sensory, personal
and free.
</P>
<P>
   Black artists are again sharing exhibition space with white
artists, art supply stores are welcoming patrons of all colors, and
public arts education is again available to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, a culture is being reclaimed and revealed through art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apartheid was a politics of space more than anything,'' says
black Johannesburg painter and curator David Koloane. ``Much of the
apartheid legislation was denying people the right to move.''
</P>
<P>
   During apartheid, blacks were not allowed into museums outside
the company of a white, so Koloane never saw the inside of a museum
until he was in his mid-30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claiming art is also reclaiming space,'' he says. &QL; 
CAN ART HEAL? &QL; 
The millennium will be a tough time for this quivering country, a
place of 11 official languages; a national anthem sung for the
first time in 1995; and two primary cultures, one black, one white,
each adept at avoiding a middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   Yet folks in and out of the country are looking to art as a
beginning way to make this divide become, instead, a tightly woven
seam.
</P>
<P>
   Says Lydia Puccinelli, curator for the Smithsonian Institution
exhibit:
</P>
<P>
   ``By claiming art in its broadest sense, Koloane sees that black
artists as well as white artists have a way to counteract the
restrictions of the past and deal with each other from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Art then provides a place for South Africans to construct
their new, complex and diverse society together,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work coming out now is still politically charged.
South Africans such as Koloane and Willie Bester and his
captivity-themed ``The Notorious Green Car'' simply aren't finished
telling the world of how they suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Gavin Jantjes and his starscapes, are more
thoughtful and retrospective of apartheid; his work is just sheer
celebration of unlimited, uncontrolled space.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Kay Hassan, whose ``First Time Voters'' is featured at
the Smithsonian exhibit, is writing the post-apartheid history
books with her artwork. She has captured the spirit of a country so
excited about democracy that its citizens are willing to travel for
days and wait in line for hours to exercise the right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Now, white South Africans, who always have been the minority,
are left wondering where they stand inside the country's borders;
it is nearly a case of reverse discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Like the black artists, many of the white artists, Sue
Williamson, for example, are fighting to come to terms with the
civil rights movement and are producing work equally critical of
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Others feel they've lost their heritage in the new world order.
The African National Congress, Mandela and Mbeki's party, isn't
saying otherwise. At Mbeki's June inauguration celebration in
Pretoria, the memorial statues of white-minority leaders such as
Barry Hertzog and Louis Botha on the grounds of the Union Building
were covered.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, South African art on both sides of the racial divide
is seeping out of Africa, as evidenced by the Smithsonian's
exhibition. Also, plays by South African Athol Fugard have long
been in the world's consciousness; white artist Norman Catherine is
starting to gain acclaim; and as a filmmaker/playwright, William
Kentridge is a buzzword in and of himself.
</P>
<P>
   On the visual arts front, another black South African exhibit is
planned for the African museum in New York next year, and bits of
art by promising artists are sneaking their way into world-class
museums.
</P>
<P>
   But South Africa has yet to have a space at the Venice Biennalle
(basically the Cannes Film Festival of the art world), and,
according to South African National Gallery curator Marilyn Martin,
the government has yet to provide adequate funding for this
renaissance to occur on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``That freedom remains as empty as the notion of the
renaissance, until the conditions are created for (black artists)
to fully participate,'' she says. ``And with a funding crisis, how
are we going to close the gap between the haves and the have
nots?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Martin, South Africa on many fronts still has
leagues to cover, but it has progressed far from the days of
ignoring black South African art. &QL; 
TROUBLED PAST &QL; 
During the apartheid regime, this art was given only sympathetic
attention, rarely exhibited, and certainly not encouraged with
publicly funded education. School cost dearly, and that was money
black South Africans didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deliberate social engineering,'' says Davies, now
chiefly a painter, ``a way to keep the black person in his place.
We were not given education that would allow us to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Because black South Africans were not allowed to leave the
country without special permission during apartheid, the only
available training was found in workshops like Koloane's, called
``Thupelo'' in South Africa, which means ``teaching by example.''
His workshop has now spread throughout the continent, reaching
would-be artists hungry for training, and even into India.
</P>
<P>
   At clinics like these, artists were trained to create art from
limited means, as finding supplies was a hefty undertaking. During
apartheid, blacks had to use different entrances to art supply
shops, pay at different counters, and were often not allowed inside
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the cost of supplies, which were largely not
affordable by any standard to blacks, most of whom were herded into
large concentration camplike structures on the edges of the cities
called townships: basically large dormitories that cleared the
white cities of those they saw as less than human.
</P>
<P>
   Township residents were bused to jobs in mines or factories and
paid beggars' wages, barely enough for clothing and food, let alone
oil and canvas. Yet the black South African culture triumphed even
over this, using industrial, cast-off material that was nothing
more than urban trash to create a genre called township art that
emerged in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Women and children twisted spent soda cans into miniature
antique vehicles, wove frayed telephone wires into baskets, braided
plastic shopping bags into rugs, and sold them in the cities to
tourists to bring in extra income.
</P>
<P>
   Painted murals decorated the seedy township walls _ one of the
less censored ways many of those inside had to express their
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Theater troupes wrote and performed plays about white government
officials being tortured and killed. A movement called Soweto
poetry emerged that chronicled the horrors of living in townships.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this politically charged artwork was either confiscated,
censored or destroyed, but not before people saw it, and not before
the government heard the message.
</P>
<P>
   In this light, the township art played a key role in
overthrowing apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it was so passionate, so threatening, so overtly
political and hard to ignore, that the white culture, lead by the
National Party's F.W. de Klerk, either began to understand that
black oppression was a crime against man, or became so apprehensive
about the impending civil war intoned in the work and political
climate that they gave in. With this idea in their minds (or gun to
their heads) the National Party dismantled apartheid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, a country breathed. &QL; 
`NO LONGER ASHAMED' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go now into the art world and know I no longer have to
bypass my color,'' says Davies, who spent many of his 11 years in
Robben Island's infamous jail at the side of Nelson Mandela. ``I
can express myself as a person, not just as a a black person.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Koloane, who also was once imprisoned, his crime was not
carrying the card that dictated his access into white-only areas:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I can embrace what my African brothers are doing. I no
longer have those doors closed for me. I can wake up and know that
there's nobody watching me. I can walk in any shop without being
told that I have to use a separate entrance; I am no longer ashamed
to say that I am South African, and that has changed my art.'' &QL;

 FBI PROBE OF YOSEMITE SLAYINGS SCRUTINIZED  &HT;     By SUSAN SWARD and STACY FINZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With an anguished expression on his face, FBI
Special Agent James Maddock posed the question about the Yosemite
killings as clearly as anyone could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask myself if we could have done anything differently that
would have prevented the death of Joie Armstrong,'' said Maddock,
standing before a battery of cameras and reporters in Sacramento on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've struggled with that over the last 24 hours, and I
continue to do so, (but) I'm confident that we've done everything
that reasonably could have been done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maddock's remarks underscored what is already obvious _ that the
FBI's investigation of the Yosemite case is now certain to come
under intense scrutiny by the public and by the FBI itself.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the agency has been reassuring the public that it had
the killers in the Yosemite tourists' slayings behind bars. The FBI
identified the alleged killers as members of a loose-knit band of
Modesto drug users with long criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   Then Monday, Cary Stayner, a 37-year-old maintenance worker, was
formally charged with last week's killing of Armstrong, and
sources, including a San Francisco TV station, say he has also
confessed killing three women touring Yosemite five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The basic facts of the case are well-known: On February 15,
Carole Sund, her daughter Julie and a family friend, Silvina
Pelosso, vanished after last being seen at the Cedar Lodge just
west of Yosemite National Park. In the ensuing days, Stayner _ who
had worked as a maintenance man at the lodge _ was interviewed by
FBI agents, as were dozens of other people living and working near
the park. But Stayner was quickly let go _ and now the public wants
to know why.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public's concern is that the FBI interviewed a guy, let
him go and he commits another crime,'' said Rick Smith, a former
FBI agent who now heads Cannon Street Inc. detective agency in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can feel good about that, but at the time they
interviewed Stayner regarding the Sund murders, in my opinion, they
must not have had probable cause to charge him,'' Smith said. ``I
don't think the public wants to change the Constitution to lean
toward charging someone where the FBI doesn't have enough proof to
charge him.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the FBI in Washington moved to put the handling of the
Yosemite killings in the best possible light. Tron Brekke, deputy
assistant director of the FBI, told The Chronicle that the media
would be overreaching to infer that Maddock's statement indicated
that something was done wrong in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak for him (Maddock), but I think he felt anguish
about putting out something that may have misled people between
Saturday and Sunday (when Maddock initially discounted any link
between Armstrong's killing and the three other slayings),'' Brekke
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his statement that he read and put out Sunday, he (Maddock)
very clearly articulated that he feels and the others on the task
force feel they did everything in their power to investigate the
Sund-Pelosso case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is something to indicate that a person is
involved in a crime, there is very little we can do to prevent that
person from being involved in a future crime,'' Brekke said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major unanswered questions in the case is how the FBI
came to seize on a group of Modesto ``cranksters'' as the killers
of the Sunds and Pelosso.
</P>
<P>
   In March, when the bodies of the three sightseers were found,
the investigation began to focus on a group of parolees in the
Central Valley. They concentrated primarily on half-brothers
Michael Larwick and Eugene Dykes, both convicted sex offenders with
histories of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The men, both arrested on unrelated charges, remain in jail.
While in custody, Dykes allegedly acknowledged playing a role in
the Sund-Pelosso murders, sources said. But his stories changed
each time he was interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a federal grand jury began hearing testimony in the
case and witnesses confirmed that agents were taking a hard look at
the men and an assortment of their associates.
</P>
<P>
   But Maddock later told reporters that they were having a
difficult time making a case _ in large part because their
witnesses were ``cranksters,'' who used methamphetamine and were
regarded as unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   But he attempted to soothe the public by publicly announcing
that all the key participants in the killings were safely behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel we have all the main players in jail,'' Maddock said
last month. ``But we are in no rush to charge them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some federal insiders now believe that the stream of oddball
witnesses, who ranged from jail inmates to known drug dealers, were
just leading investigators on.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, an 18-year-old member of the group, agreed to let
agents set up a recording device on his phone to tape a telephone
conversation between him and a woman who said she had a lot of
information on the case. But instead of giving the tape only to
investigators, the man sold it to a television tabloid show _
tainting its potential use as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's focus on the Modesto group as the only suspects in the
Sund-Pelosso case troubled even some who have worked closely with
law enforcement in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you this: If the FBI didn't have a rock solid case
against all the participants (in the Sund-Pelosso killings), they
shouldn't have put out the information that the killers were behind
bars,'' said one former homicide prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But the ex-prosecutor, who has worked on numerous homicide cases
over the years, added that he believed the FBI's assurances that
the Sund-Pelosso killers were in custody might not have contributed
to Armstrong's decapitation death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sure that made a difference in her killing,'' the
former prosecutor said. ``She more than likely would not have been
suspicious of Stayner in any event _ because of his normal
demeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   While Brekke stressed that ``no one is here to fix blame at this
point,'' others familiar with the FBI say such a high-profile case
is certain to prompt much finger-pointing within the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of case causes nothing but absolute havoc for the
FBI,'' said one source knowledgeable about the FBI's inner
workings. ``From the standpoint of the FBI's Washington management,
it's always hindsight and Monday morning quarterbacking.''

HANDYMAN ADMITS 4 KILLINGS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By STACY FINZ and JAXON VAN DERBEKEN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
(Ed. note: This story is accompanied by a sidebar, slugged
FBI-YOSEMITE)
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The handyman charged Monday with decapitating a
Yosemite naturalist has confessed that slaying as well as the
February killings of three park sightseers, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Stayner _ a 37-year-old maintenance man at the Cedar Lodge,
the motel just outside the park where the three tourists were last
seen _ knew details about the four slayings that only the killer
might know, said one source close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a jailhouse interview Monday with a San Francisco television
station, Stayner said he had dreamed about killing women for 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner told KBWB Television in detail how he killed sightseers
Carole Sund, her daughter Julie and family friend Silvina Pelosso
in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   He said he strangled Silvina Pelosso and Carole Sund in their
rented cabin at the Cedar Lodge in mid-February, then took Julie
Sund to a lake, where he killed her early the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   He said he abandoned the group's car with the bodies of Silvina
Pelosso and Carole Sund in it, returning two days later to burn
evidence and retrieve Carole Sund's wallet, which he dumped in
Modesto to confuse authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner told KBWB he was the person who tipped the FBI to the
whereabouts of Julie Sund's body by sending an anonymous letter.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought he had gotten away with the crimes and did
not leave the area for fear of drawing attention to himself. That
changed when he met Joie Ruth Armstrong, 26, last week and struck
up a chance conversation with her. He said he could not resist the
urge to kill her when he realized she was alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am guilty,'' said Stayner, who was not interviewed on
camera. ``I did murder Carole Sund, Julie Sund, Silvina Pelosso and
Joie Armstrong. ... None of the women were sexually abused in any
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have controlled myself and not done what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI agent Nick Rossi said he could not say whether Stayner's
statements were consistent with what he has told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Stayner stood silently in U.S. District Court in
Sacramento as he was being charged with a single count of murder in
last week's slaying of Armstrong. The tanned, clean-cut defendant
nodded his head when a judge asked whether he understood the
allegation. If convicted, Stayner could be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   John Balazs, an assistant public defender with the U.S.
attorney's office, represented Stayner in court and said his mood
seemed ``fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was arrested Saturday morning at a nudist colony near
Sacramento and questioned for hours about the slaying of Armstrong,
an environmental educator whose beheaded body was found Thursday in
a densely forested area of the national park, just a few hundred
feet from her home and about four miles from the Cedar Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   During the FBI interrogation, Stayner admitted killing Armstrong
as well as Carole Sund, Julie Sund, 15, and Silvina Pelosso, 16,
said the source close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunds and Pelosso visited the park in February and
disappeared from the Cedar Lodge, where they were staying. More
than a month later, Carole Sund's and Pelosso's charred bodies were
found in the trunk of their rental car about 50 miles away in the
hamlet of Long Barn. Julie Sund was discovered on the banks of Lake
Don Pedro a few days later _ and authorities said her head was
nearly severed from her body.
</P>
<P>
   Agents are trying to corroborate Stayner's statements that he
killed the tourists, said a federal official who asked not to be
named. Stayner has not been charged in the three sightseers'
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four months, investigators working on the Sund and
Pelosso killings have focused on a loose-knit group of violent
methamphetamine users living in Modesto. Many in the group,
including two half-brothers, were rounded up and jailed on
unrelated charges.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were hoping that an investigative grand jury in
Fresno would help them gather enough evidence to charge members of
the group with the three slayings. But now they are questioning
whether the men were involved at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not off the hook yet,'' said the source. `'It's very
difficult to believe he (Stayner) did this on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators looking into Armstrong's killing became suspicious
of Stayner when someone reported seeing his blue and white
International Scout near Armstrong's cabin on Foresta Road on
Wednesday about 7:30 p.m. _ an hour after Armstrong was last known
to be alive _ according to a criminal complaint filed Monday in
U.S. District Court in Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was scheduled to visit a friend that night in
Sausalito, but she never showed up. The friend called police early
the next morning to report Armstrong missing, and at 1 p.m. park
rangers and FBI agents found her body. More than three hours later,
a park ranger and a Mariposa County sheriff's detective interviewed
Stayner about the killing.
</P>
<P>
   He denied being anywhere near Foresta Road the evening of
Armstrong's death and let investigators search his truck, according
to court papers. When Stayner refused to let them look in his
backpack, they seized it, fearing that Armstrong's head _ missing
at the time _ might be hidden inside, according to the documents.
The head was later found near her body.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Stayner did not show up for work, which Cedar
Lodge employees said was unusual. Authorities put out an all-points
bulletin, and a woman at the nudist camp who recognized his name
from news reports turned him in the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his statement to the interviewing agents, Stayner provided
details about the (Armstrong) crime that are not generally known
outside law enforcement, and which corroborate his confession,''
court records say.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner is the older brother of Steven Stayner, who was abducted
from a Merced street in December 1972 and sexually abused by his
kidnapper for more than seven years. He escaped in March 1980 and
was reunited with his family, only to be killed nine years later in
a motorcycle crash at age 24.
</P>
<P>
   Merced County authorities say that in addition to the killings
of Armstrong, Pelosso and the Sunds, they want to question Cary
Stayner about the Dec. 26, 1990, shooting death of his 42-year-old
uncle, Jesse ``Jerry'' Stayner.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Sheriff Henry Strength of Merced County said Cary
Stayner had been living with his uncle at the time but had not been
considered a suspect. ``He was somewhere else (when the uncle was
killed),'' Strength said. ``Nothing tied him to the homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Stayner had come home for lunch from his job as a
dispatcher for a hay-chopping operation when he was shot with his
own gun.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner has no criminal record. He was arrested March 28, 1997,
in a drug raid on the home of a friend in Atwater, near Merced, but
was released without being charged.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said little Monday about the killing of Armstrong or the
Sund-Pelosso case. During a press conference Sunday, Special Agent
James Maddock said agents had been unable to make a link between
Stayner and the original suspects in the Sund-Pelosso killings.
</P>
<P>
   But Carole and Francis Carrington, the parents of Carole Sund
and grandparents of Julie Sund, seemed confident that their long
wait for justice may be coming to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Armstrong's family said they were not ready to
comment. An uncle, who asked to be identified only as Jim, said,
``We're exhausted. We're just drained.''

SAFETY PLAN FOR RUNWAYS CALLED A FLOP
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID DIETZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  A Federal Aviation Administration program to avoid accidents
and close calls on runways has flopped, a government oversight
report said Monday.
<P>
   The report, by the Department of Transportation's inspector
general, said the number of ``runway incursions'' remains at a high
level because the FAA has been too slow to fight the hazard.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second major analysis this year to criticize the
FAA's handling of a problem that a White House report identified in
1998 as one of the most pressing aviation dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Incursions are occasions in which aircraft get too close to each
other or to vehicles, people or objects at airports.
</P>
<P>
   The number of close encounters rose from 186 in 1993 to 325 in
1998, a 75 percent increase. Through the first six months of this
year, 149 incursions were recorded, one fewer than the comparable
period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Runway incursions continue to be a serious problem in 1999,''
the inspector general said.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes in the aftermath of two harrowing near-misses
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, a fully loaded Korean Air jumbo jet missed a cargo
plane by 50 feet while taking off at Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport. Last month, an Icelandair 757 passenger jet narrowly
averted an Air France 747 freighter in another takeoff near-miss.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector General Kenneth Mead said the FAA's 1998 plan to
reduce incursions has been ineffective because 15 of 23 proposed
actions still await implementation.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the FAA is between five and 13 months behind in
finishing such projects as installing collision-warning systems in
traffic control towers and developing individual incident reduction
plans at airports.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that unless the FAA oversees the program more
aggressively, it is unlikely to achieve its goal of reducing annual
incursions to 248, a 15 percent cut from the 1997 level, by the end
of next year.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Fraser Jones said the agency agrees with the
report's conclusions and has ``already taken actions to implement
the recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   To see to it that the 1998 plan gets implemented as quickly as
possible, FAA Administrator Jane Garvey has gotten directly
involved through monthly briefings, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, an FAA consultant also accused the agency of
foot-dragging on incursions. Mitre Corp. of Virginia said the FAA
was relying on primitive technology for guiding runway traffic,
despite a surge in air travel.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional committee looked into FAA handling of runway
incidents in 1997, the result of a series of Chronicle articles on
incursions.

 OLD 49ERS COULD EVEN SPELL FINESSE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's official: The 49ers have become the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Al Davis' Raiders were once a refuge for outcasts and misfits,
while the 49ers rejected players who ate their salad with the wrong
fork.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders' bad-guy thing played itself out, and they now seek
men of character. While the 49ers seek ... whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Walsh, new 49ers' GM who coached the team back in the days
of high moral fiber, has signed defensive end Charles Haley and
Monday added running back Lawrence Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers shipped Haley out years ago for very, very unsociable
conduct. Phillips betrayed every American team he ever played for,
college and pro. And then there are his convictions, including a
brutal attack on a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Is Walsh channeling the spirit of Jerry Tarkanian, world's
foremost Outlaws-R-Us college basketball coach? No, on a
technicality: Tark's still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers swear that Haley and Phillips have cleaned up their
acts, and maybe so, especially Haley. But Walsh is doing his best
to dump the team's Boy Scout image.
</P>
<P>
   TODAY ON Creepy Theater, we present: ``Cold Chills in the Hot
Tub.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Geist, ace reporter for KGO radio, checked into the
Cedar Lodge in Yosemite last March to file reports on the search
for three female tourists who would later turn up murdered.
</P>
<P>
   In our opening scene, Mary Ellen works hard and files her
reports, then about 10:30 p.m. decides to take a swim in the lodge
pool and a soak in the hot tub. There's no one around as she swims
her laps, until she senses something, sees a man in a black bikini
suit walk by and sink into the hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to let him ruin my plans,'' Geist says to
herself, and she joins the man in the tub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello,'' he says to her, ``my name is Cary Stayner.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next half hour he tells her the tragic story of his
brother, who spent seven years as captive of a kidnapper-molester,
then died in a motorcycle accident.
</P>
<P>
   Geist now says of her tubmate, ``He was handsome, and very nice,
very polite. But he was looking at me in a way that made me
uncomfortable, so I just got up suddenly and left. I ran up the
steps, double-bolted my door and pushed a table and chair against
it. That's very unlike me, but I got the creeps.''
</P>
<P>
   Stayner has been charged with murdering and decapitating a woman
who worked at Yosemite, and is the prime suspect in the killing of
the three tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still creeped out,'' says Mary Ellen.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Bishop Patrick Ziemann of Santa Rosa, who resigned last week and
admitted having a sexual affair with a priest, was the subject of a
glowing article in the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat last October. The
priest now claims he was forced into the three-year relationship by
Ziemann's threats to report the priest for stealing church money.
</P>
<P>
   From the P-D story: ``(Ziemann's) direct, personal style may
help explain his popularity in the face of the biggest
(molestation) scandal ever confronted by the region's Catholics ...
''
</P>
<P>
   What made Bishop Ziemann so popular? One parishioner told the
P-D, ``He's the most accessible, hands-on bishop that I've ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   CONTINUING today's theme of borderline bad taste: Country Joe
McDonald, the Berkeley music legend who rocked the original
Woodstock with his ``Vietnam Rag'' (``Whoopie, we're all going to
die!''), got bad news Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Guinness Book of World Records rejected Country Joe's formal
bid to be recognized as the person who has made the most people
yell the F-word in public. Country Joe and the Fish used to open
their act with a spell-out, Joe saying, ``Gimme a big F,'' and so
on, then, ``What's that spell?''
</P>
<P>
   He led half a million people in screaming the word at Woodstock.
It had to do with Vietnam, kids, and you had to be there, but many
found the spell-out daring and inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Guinness says its officials have no way of knowing if
anyone might have topped Joe.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's not giving up on his quest, and you have to admire
his ... Gimme a big P ... L ... U ... C ... K.
</P>
<P>
   ``STAY TUNED, folks. Immediately following the figure skating,
we'll have the finals of the drive-by shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun enthusiasts are fighting to have ``combat shooting''
declared an Olympic event. Only they've changed the name to
``practical shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitors armed with assault rifles, semiautomatic handguns
and shotguns blast away at targets shaped like people _ enemy
soldiers, pizza delivery boys, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get behind this movement, a guaranteed gold medal for
America. We'll blow away the competition.
</P>
<P>
   YES, SAN FRANCISCO, you've got the most expensive gasoline in
the country. But stop complaining. It's God's way of evening out
the blessings.

 GETTING AROUND IRA TAX  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I know that if I withdraw money from my traditional
Individual Retirement Account, I will have to pay taxes on the
money. But what if I donate the entire account to a charitable
organization? Can I avoid taxes and claim the donation as a
deduction?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not that simple. In fact, when it comes to tax matters,
practically nothing is simple.
</P>
<P>
   You can't simply pick up your IRA and hand it over to a charity
tax free. Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller says that
under tax law you would be viewed as withdrawing all your funds
from the IRA, and that is ``a taxable event.''
</P>
<P>
   You can, however, do essentially what you want to do if you wait
until you die. If you name the charity as a beneficiary in your
will, you can leave it the entire IRA, and the amount of the IRA
will be exempt from estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to give the money to charity before you die, you are
free to do that, too _ after paying taxes on the IRA withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   You don't indicate how much money is in the account, but bear in
mind that when you claim a deduction for the donation, you are
limited to a maximum of 50 percent of your adjusted gross income
for the year. For example, if you give away $100,000 and your
income is $50,000, you can claim only $25,000 as a deduction on
that year's income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, you are allowed to carry over the excess amount for
as long as five years. In the example above, you can deduct $25,000
more the next year _ assuming that your income remains at $50,000.
You can do the same thing the next year and the year after that, at
which point the full $100,000 deduction will be used up.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing an IRA
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to open two Individual Retirement Accounts, one for me
and one for my husband. Should I open two Roth IRAs, or one Roth
and one traditional?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you are opening a new IRA, I can't think of any reason to
open anything but a Roth. Roths are vastly superior to traditional
IRAs in almost every respect.
</P>
<P>
   However, because you don't mention your income, I don't know
whether you actually qualify for a Roth. Individuals can't open one
if they have income greater than $110,000, while there is a
$160,000 maximum for married couples who file a joint tax return.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest thing about a Roth is that your investment gains
accumulate tax-free. That isn't true of traditional IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   Another big advantage: You don't have to withdraw your funds
when you reach age 701/2, as you must with traditional IRAs. In
fact, you can keep making contributions to the IRA beyond that age,
and you never have to withdraw the funds. You can leave the Roth
account to your heirs, and they won't have to pay estate taxes on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Capital Gains Taxes
</P>
<P>
   Q: I realize that one needs to pay capital gains taxes on
profits one makes trading stocks. But can you tell me whether
capital gains could push me into a higher income tax bracket?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it conceivably could happen _ but only with short-term
capital gains. If you don't sell a stock until at least a year and
a day after you buy it, any profit becomes a long-term capital
gain, and there is no bracket creep. (I'm not calling you names;
that's jargon for moving into a higher tax bracket.)
</P>
<P>
   For example, if your ordinary income places you in the 28
percent tax bracket, any additional income from long-term capital
gains will be taxed at a maximum rate of only 20 percent. If you
are in the 15 percent bracket, your long-term capital gains would
be taxed at 10 percent. Obviously, your long-term capital gains
wouldn't be pushing you into a higher bracket.
</P>
<P>
   But it can happen with short-term gains, which are taxed as
ordinary income. If they are big enough _ or if you already are
close to the next highest bracket _ they could push you over.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, a married couple filing a joint return would move from
the 15 percent bracket to the 28 percent bracket if their taxable
income were to rise above $43,050. A move from the 28 percent
bracket into the 31 percent bracket occurs when income exceeds
$104,050. The 36 percent bracket is reached when income exceeds
$158,550, and you get into the top bracket _ 39.6 percent _ when
your income goes above $283,150.
</P>
<P>
   We should all have such problems.

 SOME EX-GENENTECH SHAREHOLDERS FUMING  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Several former Genentech shareholders complained
Monday that they got the runaround when they tried to act on an
offer to give small investors like them first crack at some of
Genentech's reissued shares.
<P>
   Genentech stock temporarily ceased public trading in June, when
the Swiss firm Roche Holdings acquired Genentech in a deal that
required shareholders to sell their holdings at $4 below market
price.
</P>
<P>
   When Genentech prepared to go public again in July, the South
San Francisco, Calif., company publicized a special deal: It would
set aside some shares in the new offering so small investors who
had sold at a loss could get in on the action.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech, which returned to the stock market July 20 at $97 per
share, closed at $128.38 Monday _ a 32-percent profit for those who
got in.
</P>
<P>
   But after a Chronicle column Monday questioned whether small
investors had a fair chance at any shares, half a dozen readers
called or e-mailed to say they'd tried to follow the procedures
Genentech had laid out, only to get rebuffed in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Kochenderfer of Belmont, Calif., has asked the Securities
and Exchange Commission to investigate her complaint. Kochenderfer,
who had held 200 shares, furnished a copy of the fax she sent to
Genentech before the deadline for getting in on the special
program.
</P>
<P>
   She says Genentech ignored her fax, and when she called the
firm's investor relations department to complain, she was hung up
on.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Malinowski, a San Francisco retiree with 200 shares, didn't
keep as detailed a record of her attempts to get in on the offer.
But she's certain she phoned Genentech investor relations three
times and never got called back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 200 shares aren't going to make me or break me,'' she
said. ``It's the idea it was really a public relations act and was
not sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   Four other former Genentech shareholders contacted The Chronicle
with similar tales.
</P>
<P>
   This follows complaints last week by small shareholders that
Genentech didn't inform them of the offer but relied on the media
to disseminate it.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech spokeswoman Laura Leber repeated that the company had
worked hard to create a special program for former shareholders _ a
rarity in public offerings _ and said any shortcomings owed to the
fact that many people wanted in on the offer, and everything
happened so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the best job we could,'' she said. ``If the stock were
flat, nobody would care.''
</P>
<P>
   Leber repeated that Genentech's underwriters, led by J.P.
Morgan, had set aside a generous 20 percent of the offering _ 4
million shares in all _ for three classes of small investors:
employees, former shareholders and private investors who have
relationships with institutions and brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
   But Leber declined to say how many shares were purchased by each
of the three classes. ``It is not customary to break the figure
down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Gable, a spokesman for Charles Schwab, which handled the
sales to employees and former shareholders, said his company could
put its finger on that number but would not reveal it unless
authorized by Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Taulli, an analyst with the IPO Monitor newsletter, said in
a typical IPO, anywhere from 1 to 10 percent of the shares are set
aside for a ``friends and family program.'' Companies decide who
makes the list. Taulli said underwriters also allot shares to
brokerage houses close to them. Those brokers typically give their
biggest customers a crack at hot IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What might happen is you have a lot of rich private
individuals who had connections to the underwriters'' getting in on
the 20 percent of the shares Genentech dedicated to all three
classes of investors, Taulli said.

 MATTEL TO SELL FURNITURE ONLINE VIA GOODHOME.COM  &HT;     By DAN FOST  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ A new venture spinning out of Mattel Inc.'s Marin
County, Calif., divisions has $50 million in backing and an
audacious goal: to use sophisticated technology to sell home
furnishings over the Internet.
<P>
   The new company, GoodHome.com, will announce its formation
Tuesday, and it plans to launch its Web site by October. In
addition to toy giant Mattel, GoodHome has investments from Hearst
Corp. and leading venture capital firms Thomas H. Lee Co. and
Weston Presidio Capital.
</P>
<P>
   GoodHome will use technology from Broderbund Software's home
design CD-ROMs to allow Web surfers to design a kitchen, a living
room or a bathroom _ and then purchase the items online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the opportunities for e-commerce retailers in home
furnishings are pretty plentiful going forward,'' said analyst Alan
Rifkin, a partner at Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of home goods online should hit $319 million this year,
according to Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., and could top
$3 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the challenges is definitely going to be presenting the
product itself, which is going to make or break some of these
companies,'' said Forrester analyst Seema Williams. The company
will have to present good enough pictures online, Williams said,
``for a consumer to be able to make a purchase decision without
actually making a visit to the furniture store.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Mack, the chief executive of GoodHome, said ``it's a little
bit of a fallacy'' that people need to sit on a sofa before they
buy it. Consumers often order from catalogs, particularly if the
store they're visiting doesn't have the exact item they want, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pottery Barn and Crate &AMP; Barrel are a $7 billion industry,''
Mack said. ``People are already doing it. We got over that concern
very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack, 30, was a vice president at Broderbund when the company
was acquired last year by the Learning Co., which in turn was
bought by toy giant Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   In the new venture, he'll oversee 70 people, with 30 based in
the San Rafael, Calif., headquarters; another 30 in Brea, Calif.;
and 10 in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   While Mattel has provided most of the employees and technology,
GoodHome has plenty of expertise from its other investors. Hearst
is the publisher of such magazines as Good Housekeeping, House
Beautiful and Country Living. Hearst New Media and Technology, the
corporate division leading the GoodHome investment, owns half of
online women's portal Women.com, among other startups.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas H. Lee Co. manages more than $6 billion and helped build
the Learning Co. San Francisco's Weston Presidio Capital is a $900
million fund that helped build Restoration Hardware, Staples and
DigitalChef.
</P>
<P>
   The $50 million is a large amount for a first round of venture
funding, but GoodHome will need it: The company is not only
building a brand from scratch, but it also will have to build a
warehouse for the furniture it plans to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that to offer top customer service, we have to have
direct control,'' said Mack, the CEO. The warehouse will be ``key,
key, key to the success. I can't tell you the number of people who
are disappointed as they redecorate and things are delivered late.
We will spare no expense to make this the best possible consumer
experience in this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   GoodHome will also face competition from companies like
Massachusetts' Furniture.com, which launched this year and is
already racking up impressive sales, according to analyst Rifkin.
But the growing market and a brick-and-mortar industry slow to
change present a great opportunity, Rifkin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furniture in and of itself is a very nonprogressive
industry,'' he said. ``Many manufacturers and some retailers want
to protect their dealer network. It hasn't evolved with the
times.''

 DUTCH AUCTIONS GIVE EVERYONE ACCESS TO STOCK IPOS  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Although he recently underwrote two dull initial
public offerings, famed San Francisco investment banker Bill
Hambrecht makes no apologies _ and promises that a half-dozen more
dull IPOs will follow soon.
<P>
   Last month, his new firm, W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co., used a Dutch
auction via the Internet _ what he calls an ``Open IPO'' _ to sell
shares of Salon.com, an online magazine based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the wild IPO market of the past year, dozens of newly issued
stocks have doubled, tripled or more on the first trading day. That
has been particularly true of companies with an Internet identity.
</P>
<P>
   Not Salon.com. Its stock finished the first trading day 50 cents
below its $10.50 offering price.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it might seem that the IPO was a failure _ and
it was branded as such by much of the media. But it succeeded on
its own terms, insists Hambrecht, who co-founded the Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist investment banking firm three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht explains that the Dutch auction system automatically
causes a stock to be issued at a price near its intrinsic market
value. So it lets a company get full value for its shares, rather
than ``leaving money on the table'' to satisfy the greed of IPO
speculators.
</P>
<P>
   In a Dutch auction, investors specify how many shares they are
willing to buy and at what price.
</P>
<P>
   W.R. Hambrecht's brokerage customers, along with customers of a
few affiliated brokerage firms _ most notably, Fidelity Investments
_ can post their bids online directly.
</P>
<P>
   Customers of other brokerage firms can get in on the auctions as
well, but not directly. They can place bids only if their brokers
agree to submit them through the W.R. Hambrecht Web site at
www.openipo.com.
</P>
<P>
   A computer sorts the bids to determine the highest price at
which the investment banker can sell all the shares offered, and
they are then sold at that price to everyone who bid that much or
more.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch auctions have been used for years to raise money for
companies in the United States and abroad. Hambrecht's special
contribution is to make the Dutch auction available to everyone
interested in an IPO and to conduct it over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Most traditional IPOs are grossly underpriced at the offering,
Hambrecht observes, to provide windfall profits for a small, elite
group of favored investors _ institutions and individuals who have
given the underwriter large amounts of brokerage business. Ordinary
investors have virtually no chance of getting in at the opening.
</P>
<P>
   Once the IPO is completed, many of the initial investors _ with
no desire to own a stake in the company _ quickly sell their shares
in the market as other investors bid the price up.
</P>
<P>
   But with Hambrecht's Open IPO, investors who really want the
stock can get in at the start. In fact, there is scant incentive
for anyone else to buy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a temptation for managers with large stakes in their
own companies to use the old-fashioned, restricted type of IPO. If
the IPO attracts wild speculation and the stock price spikes, it
can make them fabulously rich.
</P>
<P>
   But Todd Hagen, chief financial officer of Salon.com, says his
company was ``very pleased'' with the results of its Open IPO. ``We
maximized the amount of cash that came into the company and placed
the stock in the hands of long-term shareholders,'' he remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Grundfest, a Stanford law professor and former commissioner
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, calls Hambrecht's Open
IPO ``a very exciting, bold, creative idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The Open IPO is designed to attract what Hambrecht calls
``affinity groups'' _ people with a strong interest in a company,
such as customers and suppliers, who are likely to become long-term
holders. That kind of holder keeps the stock from becoming too
volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Low volatility is a good thing for companies, Hambrecht argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volatility is very destructive to a company,'' he remarks.
``It creates a crisis with the employees and their options. Also,
when the price shoots way up, many investors pay too much for their
shares, and when the stock goes down again they think they have
bought a loser _ so you have a lot of discontented shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht says he began developing the Open IPO concept after
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist co-managed the IPO of Boston Beer Co. in 1995.
The company wanted to issue $30 million worth of stock, and the
chief executive insisted that $10 million worth be sold to people
who actually drank his beer, which includes the Samuel Adams brand.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Beer accomplished this by hanging tombstone ads for the
IPO around the necks of the beer bottles before they were shipped
for distribution. The response was tremendous, with customers
placing orders for four times as many shares as were available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of the customers who bought are still shareholders four
years later,'' Hambrecht says.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht, who was then serving as chairman of H&AMP;Q but not as
chief executive, broached the Open IPO idea to Dan Case, the firm's
CEO. Case didn't want to go that route, so Hambrecht quit and
started W.R. Hambrecht in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an organization is very successful the old way, it is
hard to change,'' Hambrecht remarks. He also notes that Case made
``a strategic decision'' to offer IPO shares over the Charles
Schwab Web site, rather than launching a do-it-yourself online
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Newman, a spokeswoman for H&AMP;Q, said that neither Case nor
anyone else at the firm wants to comment on Bill Hambrecht's new
venture.
</P>
<P>
   With a Dutch auction, companies don't see the kind of
after-market enthusiasm that spikes the share prices of ordinary
IPOs. Most of the enthusiasm already has been discounted by the
auction.
</P>
<P>
   Salon.com stock, after the IPO at $10.50, has moved as high as
$15.13 and as low as $9 _ not particularly volatile, compared with
most other Internet IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Even less volatile was W.R. Hambrecht's first IPO, Sonoma's
Ravenswood Winery, which went public in April at $10.50 per share.
In nearly four months of trading, it has never moved higher than
$11.13 or lower than $10.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone transposed our stock chart to a hospital monitor,
they'd say `The patient is dead, tie a tag to his toe and get him
out of here,' '' quips W. Reed Foster, Ravenswood's chairman and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   However, Foster says he is grateful to W.R. Hambrecht for
underwriting the issue, because he was turned down by larger
investment bankers who considered Ravenswood _ with annual revenues
in the $20 million range _ too small to bother with.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their low-key debuts, Hambrecht's Dutch auctions pose a
potentially serious competitive threat to the rest of the
investment banking community.
</P>
<P>
   He says some ``very large'' publicly held companies _ which he
declines to identify _ are considering forsaking their usual
investment bankers and making secondary offerings through W.R.
Hambrecht.
</P>
<P>
   They are attracted not only by the prospect of getting full
value for their shares, but also by W.R. Hambrecht's relatively low
underwriting fee. The firm charges its clients 3 to 5 percent of
the proceeds from a securities sale, compared with the industry
standard of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht says he can scrape by with a lower fee because
Internet-based IPOs entail less labor and other overhead costs than
standard IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts argue that IPOs with scrupulously fair prices might
look good in theory, but that they won't catch on because they are
out of tune with the psychology of today's markets.
</P>
<P>
   Wild swings in the market price are exactly what IPO investors
want these days, says David Menlow, president of IPO Financial
Network, a New Jersey research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a decade ago, Menlow says, stocks that rose a
half-point from their IPO prices on the first trading day were
considered hot. In today's market, he says, ``That would be a major
disappointment. The investors today are spoiled.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only investors, but many companies as well, want their
stocks to surge, because that attracts publicity for the company
and more buyers for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   That is false reasoning, contends Jay Ritter, a professor at the
University of Florida, who is widely considered the top academic
expert on IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly does attract attention when a company doubles on
the first day, but it's incredibly expensive advertising,'' he
observes.
</P>
<P>
   He points to Gadzoox Networks, a San Jose, Calif., networking
company that went public last week at $21 per share and finished
the day at $74.81.
</P>
<P>
   ``They left $188 million on the table _ which is defined as the
number of shares sold times the price jump on the first day,''
Ritter says. ``For $188 million, Gadzoox could have bought every
advertisement on next year's Super Bowl broadcast and it would have
gotten a lot more visibility that way.''

 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ I have just hung up from having a casual chat
with my son. He lives in Philadelphia now. Come Aug. 14, he'll be
married. Casually, he wondered aloud if I'd found a dress for the
wedding. I offered a description that apparently rendered him
speechless _ momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's purple and green with a long purple, ruffled slip that
hangs out in the front.'' Being a little concerned that my
description had fallen short of his expectations (or possibly (SET
ITAL)far(END ITAL) exceeded them), I hurriedly explained that I had
shoes and a hat to match. Silence.
</P>
<P>
   Kristofor is my one and only kid, so I've never married anybody
off before. His father and I (both airline folks) were married in a
minister's study between flights. We had five witnesses _ his
roommate, mine, and a couple of friends, three of whom gave us
coffee pots. My point is, I don't know about wedding stuff.
</P>
<P>
   When friends ask if I'm ready for the big day, I ask them what's
to get ready? His father is handling the rehearsal supper from
Georgia, and if I have a dress and directions to DuBois, Penn., the
bride-to-be's hometown, what else do I need? I'm just the mother of
the groom and I'm quite familiar with my job specifications: Wear
beige and keep my mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   Although I've apparently blown it in the dress department, I'm
doing fine in the ``mouth shut'' area because I'm here and they're
somewhere else. Out of range, so to speak. And the more I think
about it, the more thankful I am for having been clever enough to
have a son instead of a daughter. That way I don't have to toss in
my sleep worrying about tables, cakes, and string quartets.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the kids faxed a copy of their gift registry to me.
I'd never seen one before because when my friends were getting
married back in the '50s, the only registering anyone did was for
crystal, china, and silver. Of course they all ended up with the
usual three sugar shells and a nut spoon nobody knew what in the
hell to do with.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of the kids
wandering into Bloomingdale's or wherever, and living out their
fantasies. ``Umm,'' they'd muse, pointing, ``we'd like two of
these, six of those, and could the Steinway be delivered to a
third-floor walkup?'' Kind of like polite blackmail _ fork over or
you're out of the loop. Giving should be spontaneous. And what's
wrong with three coffee pots? They all break anyway.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, a fax of their wish list arrived. I was
curious. This was a license to snoop _ just about as nosy as an
almost-mother-in-law can get. ``Macy's West celebrates the wedding
of Amy J. Barley and Kristofor C. Schuett on Saturday, August 14,
1999. Amy and Kristofor registered at the Lazarus Tuttle Crossing
store.'' I thought that was kind of nice and personal.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets and towels, and some slotted things (spoons and spatulas)
headed the list. Candlesticks and vases followed. Now I'm thinking,
Isn't that romantic? Visions of these beautiful, starry-eyed
children bringing each other flowers and dining by candlelight fill
my head.
</P>
<P>
   On a more practical note, there's a registry from the local
hardware store in DuBois. Need: muffin tins, cookie sheets, a
vacuum cleaner, a can crusher, and a dual-temp glue gun. I'm not
sure what glue guns and can crushers do, but they sound modest
enough. One item stopped me dead in my tracks _ a circular saw.
Those things cut off fingers! I blew my cool and called the kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``NO ELECTRIC SAWS.'' His reaction was pretty much the same as
with the dress. Then he reminded me he would be celebrating his
32nd birthday three days after the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' I barked, ``and you'll do it with all of your fingers.
You may be old enough to be married but not to have power tools.''
Silence. Stupid! I'm talking to myself now. You're turning into a
goofy old broad in a funny dress (and hat to match). I apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget it Mum, I love you and you're going to make one great
mother-in-law. Now about the green and purple. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Ain't life grand?

 &HT;    Preferred stocks can be attractive
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The stock market is so high now that rational
investors should be at least a little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's true that large-company stocks have averaged a
pleasing 11.22 percent total return over the long term. But it's
also true that when things go wrong, they can stay wrong for a very
long time.
</P>
<P>
   Large-company stocks hit a peak in August 1929. Then came the
Depression. The S&AMP;P 500 index fell 86 percent, and it took 25 years
for it to get back to its 1929 level.
</P>
<P>
   That's a long time indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The market is giving many people the willies, which explains why
more conservative alternatives _ such as preferred stocks _ are
getting more attention.
</P>
<P>
   Preferred stocks, a cousin of the common stocks most of us
usually invest in, are an intriguing possibility. Preferred shares
are bought and sold just like common shares of the same company.
They're listed side by side in the stock tables.
</P>
<P>
   Preferred shares are usually issued by large, mature companies,
such as utilities and auto manufacturers. About a third of the
companies in the S&AMP;P 500 issue preferred stock.
</P>
<P>
   Preferred stock gets its value mainly from the relatively large
dividend it pays. For example, IBM's preferred stock pays an annual
dividend of $1.88 per share, compared with 48 cents for common
stock. The price of the common stock depends not so much on the
dividend as on the performance of the company itself. As sales and
earnings go up, the price of the common stock will usually follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preferred stock can be thought of as a cross between a bond
and a common share of stock,'' said Tish Jackson, chief investment
officer of the Bank of America Private Bank in Georgia. It manages
about $4 billion in assets of affluent customers.
</P>
<P>
   The shares are called preferred because their dividends are paid
before those owed on common shares.
</P>
<P>
   The main advantages of preferred shares are the relatively high
dividends and the more stable price of the stock. The chart
illustrates how much IBM's common and preferred shares differ.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorable element is that preferred shareholders will
get their money back before common shareholders should the company
go bankrupt. That offers a degree of protection, even though
preferred shares stand in line behind bond holders.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the stable price means preferred shareholders
will benefit very little if the company's performance _ and common
stock price _ shoot up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all remember 10 years ago, when everybody thought IBM was
about to go out of business,'' said Jackson. ``Now it's done a
fabulous turnaround. Those who own the preferred shares would not
have participated in that recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Another disadvantage is that preferred shares usually do not
have voting rights. You own a piece of the company, but you have no
say in how it is managed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another potential drawback with most preferred stocks is
that the dividend is fixed. If interest rates go up, the price of
the stock will go down, much like the price of a bond. If inflation
goes up, the purchasing power of the fixed dividend will go down.
One other factor to consider: Your reward is in dividends, which
are taxed as ordinary income. With common shares, you hope to make
money by selling the stock at a higher price than you paid. That
incurs capital gains taxes, which are lower than ordinary
income-tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least four mutual funds that specialize in
preferred stocks. I don't think they are an attractive alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them are closed-end funds with returns from OK to very
attractive. They also have high expenses _ 1.32 percent for the
Preferred Income fund and 1.46 percent for the Putnam Dividend
Income fund. That's too expensive for me, especially when I see
that total returns are between 7 percent and 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The other two funds are structured to appeal to institutional or
corporate investors. Vanguard _ a reliable and customer-friendly
outfit _ offers one of those two. Morningstar, the Chicago-based
mutual fund tracker, gives the Vanguard fund a blunt assessment:
``It is not appropriate for individual investors.'' With all those
variables, the final question is the usual, straightforward one: Is
this a good idea for me? The answer is the usual, complicated one:
It depends on your circumstances and your goals. Experts can
explain the facts, but the selection is up to you.

 &HT;    NBA: Rookie Terry's world a whirl
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since Arizona was eliminated from the NCAA Tournament
in March, Jason Terry's life has been a dizzying experience. Not
until the point guard landed with the Atlanta Hawks last month as
their first-round draft choice did he manage to find any calm.
</P>
<P>
   To get to that point, however, Terry experienced anxiety,
fulfillment, anger, disappointment, confusion and, finally,
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if he can only get some rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person would have to walk in my shoes to understand what
I've been through,'' Terry said. ``It's hard to really explain it.
You have to live it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time in his life one would think would bring only joy,
Terry, 21, made difficult decisions that brought a lot of pain and,
for a time, damaged his most coveted relationship _ the one with
his mother, Andrea Cheatham. He withdrew from college six weeks
before graduating, a decision Cheatham did not like. He was advised
to do so by his former agent, Larry Fox, who would not have been
Cheatham's choice to represent her son. She expressed her concerns
about Fox in a well-crafted letter she sent to the NCAA, the NBA
Players Association, the Pacific 10 and the Arizona coaches.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Cheatham accused Fox of spending ``considerable
time, money and favors (on Terry) laying the groundwork for an
indebted relationship.'' She cited cash gifts and a Caribbean trip
Terry took with two friends at Fox's expense as an attempt to
``enslave them to the point they feel obligated to sign with him. .
. . Two weeks later, my son signs. Surprise, surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry was extremely upset about the letter and told his mother
so. Their relationship, which while he was growing up in Seattle
had been as close as mother and son could be, suffered. ``You have
to understand that his mother has never been through this before,''
Fox said. ``She's very opinionated and has a bad temper. She tried
to blame everything on me. She bad-mouthed me. She got very close
to a woman in San Francisco, and she wanted her to represent Jason.
When he signed with me, she started bad-mouthing me _ even though
that woman had no experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The other agent, Ndidi Opia, countered, ``It serves no purpose
for me to dignify that kind of propaganda. I did not know Larry Fox
is so well-versed in my background. I've been negotiating sports
contracts for the past six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox contends that Cheatham ``regrets writing the letter,'' and
he added, ``All I could do was laugh about it.'' Apparently, he's
the only one laughing. Based on the letter, the Pac-10 is
investigating Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Terry said, he and his mother ``fell out'' after she
distributed the letter but they later reunited. She was among 21
family members in Washington at the June 30 draft, and she visited
Terry here during the rookie and free-agent camp last week.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal ``has made us stronger,'' Terry said. ``There were a
couple of misunderstandings. We hadn't communicated. She wrote some
stuff that wasn't true. Most importantly, we're all right now. Time
heals all wounds. It was difficult for both of us. But you've only
got one mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawks general manager Pete Babcock said he was unaware of
Cheatham's letter. But ``all the research we did was all positive
about Jason,'' Babcock said. ``He was great in the three days
together (for the camp). His college coach, Lute Olson, told me
that when Mike Bibby was a freshman, Jason volunteered to come off
the bench, because he could handle it. That tells you about his
unselfishness right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheatham admires her son's unselfishness, too, but his
withdrawal from school really angered her. Terry was on course to
graduate with his class with a degree in family services. But Fox
said Terry had countless out-of-town obligations that made it
impossible for him to attend classes. He cited appearances around
the country as the CBS and Sports Illustrated National Player of
the Year and pre-draft individual workouts and camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry leaving school is blown way out of proportion,'' Fox
said. ``It's very easy to jump to conclusions. He was very close to
graduating, yes. But he was being flown all over the country
accepting awards. He was being pulled in so many directions. Three
or four times a week he would leave Tucson for a different city.
There were the camps and then the individual workouts. It was
something that he had to put a lot of concentration on, because it
was very important to his basketball future. But he wrote a letter
to withdraw instead of receiving incompletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry said, ``I knew after my last game that I was going to
withdraw. School is going to be there. My family's OK with it. I'm
going to go back in the summer to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   But not this summer. Too much to do. This weekend, his first
basketball camp as an NBA player opens in Seattle. As much as
playing in the country's famous arenas and against the world's best
talent was a dream for Terry, so was having his own camps. Among
the first deeds Terry had Fox do was establish three of them: one
in Seattle, one in Tacoma and another in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to give back, and to do it now,'' Terry
said. ``There's no need to wait. The opportunity is there. Seattle
has been good to me. So (have) Tacoma and Tucson. It was very
important to me to get started on giving back now.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few weeks ago, Terry, whose camps had been set up by Fox,
fired his agent and signed a deal with No Limit Management, the
fledging sports agency owned by Percy Miller, the rapper, producer
and record mogul known as Master P.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was livid. ``It's a very exciting time in Jason's life, but
he's confused about some things,'' he said. ``He's made some tough
decisions on his life. . .. It's bad he's caught up in this
lunacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry said, ``It's not lunacy. The agent (Fox) did his job for
two months. He was good for then. It was time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   No Limit executive Tevester Scott said the company had an
interest in Terry because ``he's a good kid, a great athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said, ``He's clean-cut and about being a role model. Our
first concern is for Jason to get his career together. I don't know
anything about that other agent stuff, and I don't want to know.
He's with us now, and the emphasis is on helping him flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry showed in the three-day series of games at Life College
that he can be a major factor; he scored 30 points in his first
game against No. 3 pick Baron Davis of Charlotte and generally
displayed flashes of brilliance at both ends of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his life has begun to settle. Terry and his fiancee and
21-month-old daughter Jasionna have found a home in the Atlanta
area. He has a three-year sneaker contract with Converse with six
figures and a three-year, $4.73 million deal with the Hawks. He has
representation with No Limit that he's happy with and a
relationship with his mother that he says is stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basketball is the easy part,'' Terry said. ``People can
never understand all that comes with being someone ready to get
drafted, what I had to go through. It was difficult. The agent
situation is difficult for anybody. The family situation is
something to deal with, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm here now, in a city I want to be in and with a team
that I'm happy with. So, finally, I can get on with my career.''

   SEC salaries: Where does it pay to coach football?By Chip Towers
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ The University of Georgia long has been said to be
a a good place to coach football. The Bulldogs coaches now are
taking that notion to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's coaching staff is the second-best paid in the
Southeastern Conference, according to a league-wide salary survey
conducted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Only Tennessee,
which has won the past two SEC championships, pays its coaching
staff better than the Bulldogs, and then by a total of just $31,000
a year. Georgia coaches will make nearly $68,000 more than those at
Florida, the league's winningest team this decade, and almost
$150,000 more than Mississippi State, which played Tennessee in the
conference championship game last season. In fact, Georgia football
coaches will make nearly $101,000 more this year than they did last
year _ an increase of 13.4 percent _ even though the Bulldogs did
not win a championship or play in a major bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The average pay raise for faculty and non-faculty employees at
UGA for the current fiscal year was 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Including head coach Jim Donnan, who will make $160,000 in base
salary this year, the Bulldogs have six coaches earning more than
$100,000 each. Only Tennessee, with six $100,000 coaches, plus a
seventh making $99,662, can match that number.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is anything but apologetic for paying its coaches well.
Acknowledging that such salaries usually follow huge success on the
field, athletics director Vince Dooley said the Bulldogs are doing
what it takes to keep their staff together in anticipation of
championships to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably a little ahead of the game on the salaries,
because we haven't had the production yet. But we think that
production is going to come as a result of the coaches that we
have,'' Dooley said. ``You normally reward production. We are
investing in the anticipation of production, and we believe it's a
good investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan has been the driving force behind the higher salaries. He
has worked hard to assemble the current staff and, perhaps just as
important, keep it in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always going to try to pay our coaches as much as we
can,'' Donnan said. ``I'm not too concerned with what others make.
We just do whatever we can to have the best coaching staff we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the raises can be attributed to ``market-driven''
situations. Coaching can be a transient business, and the best in
the business are constantly tempted by bigger and better deals.
That situation has contributed to Georgia's spiraling payroll
recently.
</P>
<P>
   In order to lure Kevin Ramsey away from Tennessee, which had
just won a national championship, Donnan had to offer the secondary
coach a coordinator's position and a hefty pay increase. Ramsey is
Georgia's defensive coordinator and, with a $130,000 salary, its
highest-paid assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey will make $38,000 more this year with the Bulldogs than
he did last year at Tennessee, an increase of 41 percent. He and
Tennessee defensive coordinator Johnny Chavis are the SEC's
highest-paid assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Three Georgia coaches received raises of more than 20 percent.
Linebackers coach Brad Lambert got a 26.5 percent bump to $93,600,
a ``market-driven'' increase resulting from overtures from Tulane.
Former Georgia coach and longtime Donnan assistant Chris Scelfo,
who was hired as head coach at Tulane in December, wanted to make
Lambert the Green Waves' defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line coach Rodney Garner saw his pay increase from
$95,000 a year to $114,400. Donnan denies that the raise was a
direct result of Auburn's interest in Garner, but the Tigers
approached Garner to return to his alma mater as defensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Five coaches have left Georgia since Donnan became coach in
1996, and all but one of them did so to become a head coach or a
coordinator at another program: Daryl Drake to Baylor as offensive
coordinator; Greg Briner to SMU as offensive coordinator; Mickey
Mathews to James Madison University as head coach, and Scelfo to
Tulane as head coach. The exception was former defensive line coach
George Edwards, who took an NFL job with the Dallas Cowboys after
the '97 season and doubled his salary in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that shows the quality of coaches we like to hire,''
Donnan said, ``and I think that's the kind of coaches we have to
have to be competitive in this league.''

   DROUGHT-LAWNS _ May was drier than normal, according to National

target as far as precipitation goes. Even with normal rainfall,
though, lawns tend to go dormant through the hottest part of the
summer, so your yard is probably showing lots of brown spots unless

furniture. Interest in painted furniture has been soaring for years

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ House Republican leaders are whipping uneasy GOP
moderates into line to pass a massive $792 billion, 10-year tax cut
package. The president, for his part, is tendering $250 billion in

wedding stuff. When friends ask if I'm ready for the big day, I ask
them, what's to get ready? His father is handling the rehearsal
supper from Georgia, and if I have a dress and directions to
DuBois, Penn., the bride-to-be's hometown, what else do I need? I'm
just the mother of the groom and I'm quite familiar with my job
specifications: Wear beige and keep my mouth shut. (Schuett, Cox

HOUSE PASSES ITS OWN ABOMINABLE JUVENILE CRIME BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, the U.S. House passed H.R. 1501, the Juvenile
Justice Reform Act of 1999. The bill contains an amendment authored
by Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, that strips children in jails of
protections against physical or sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time that Congress has shown its nasty side
in regard to children. Last year the Senate passed a bill that
would have allowed young teenagers to be jailed with adults _
despite the overwhelming evidence that when young people are
confined in the same facility with adults, they are beaten and
raped, sometimes killed, and too often commit suicide under such
conditions. Fortunately, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender
Act, S.10, never became law.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest abomination called a reform, section 110
eliminates any consent decree ``that provides for remedies relating
to prison conditions'' and was entered into before the Prison
Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) was passed in 1995. PLRA was passed to
make it difficult for inmates or relatives to sue a prison system
for violations of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, in a consent decree involving incarcerated children,
parents sue a county or state in order to stop the jailing of teens
with adults or to end some mistreatment of imprisoned teens. The
county or state agrees to no longer jail children with adults or
agrees to end some ill-conceived method of dealing with children in
jails _ without admitting wrongdoing. A consent decree is like a
contract between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Center of Juvenile and Criminal Justice provides a striking
example of a consent decree that would be wiped out by H.R. 1501.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Horn's 15-year-old son Robbie was held in Oldham County
jail in LaGrange, Ky., for a minor infraction. He took off his
shirt, wrapped one sleeve around his neck and the other around the
bars of his cell and hanged himself. Rita Horn sued the county for
jailing juveniles with adults. Records show that nearly 1,400
children were held in the county jail in a four-year period _ most
for minor offenses. As a result of the lawsuit, in 1985, the Oldham
County officials signed a consent decree in which they agreed to
never again hold children in the jail.
</P>
<P>
   If DeLay has his way, Oldham County can start jailing juveniles
with adults once more. With the sad predictable results.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 20 news release, Mark Soler, president of the Youth
Law Center in Washington, D.C., commented: ``The DeLay provisions
would immediately wipe out protections in scores of counties around
America where children have been abused and mistreated in adult
jails and juvenile facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of abuses curtailed or ended by these consent decrees
stagger the imagination: Children in juvenile detention in
Philadelphia were regularly beaten with paddles and chains. Unruly
children in juvenile detention in Hannibal, Mo., were strapped to
boards and leaned against a wall _ sometimes upside down. Children
in state institutions in Arizona were stripped naked, hands and
feet tied to the four corners of bed frames and kept in solitary
confinement for days at a time. In Oklahoma, children in one state
juvenile correctional institution were handcuffed, hogtied and
beaten in the dungeon-like ``punishment unit.''
</P>
<P>
   If DeLay has his way, all these obscene practices can begin once
again.
</P>
<P>
   The DeLay amendment, however, raises a significant legal
question. Can a law passed by Congress override consent decrees or
agreements worked out between counties or states and those
individuals who sued? Can a federal law declare null and void a
state's agreement over how a state facility will be run? It's
doubtful. And if the DeLay amendment becomes part of the law, it
will lead to more litigation over this constitutional issue.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic that the GOP flies the banner of local control, yet
this amendment, authored by a Republican representative, would
completely destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   In response to DeLay's amendment to the House juvenile justice
bill, Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., offered an amendment to the
Senate's Commerce and Judiciary Appropriations bill that would
protect children from abuse in all the nation's jails and
correctional facilities.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry, the Children's Defense Fund and 13 other organizations
sent a letter to the U.S. Senate in support of Wellstone's
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The letter states, in part: ``The U.S. Department of Justice
issued a report earlier this year documenting widespread inhumane
and abusive conditions for children with mental illness in jails
and juvenile facilities. The report cited cases of extreme physical
abuse and neglect, including lengthy periods of isolation and the
use of tear gas as chemical restraints. ... The Wellstone amendment
would allow federal courts to protect children, especially those
with mental illness, from danger and mistreatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Wellstone amendment was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill now goes to a House-Senate conference committee
along with another version of a juvenile crime bill which the
Senate passed (S. 254).
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill dismantles the federal mandate to study and
attempt to correct the problem of disproportionate minority
confinement (DMC). In every state of the union, teens of color are
treated more severely by law enforcement and prison officials.
</P>
<P>
   Recent news stories in the Baltimore Sun document that in
Maryland mentally ill delinquents are treated differently,
depending upon race.
</P>
<P>
   White teens who are mentally ill and have committed crimes are
placed in residential centers that specialize in treating mental
illness. Teens of other races who have committed similar offenses
and have similar mental problems are locked up in juvenile jails or
state training schools and given tranquilizers or psychotropic
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun also reported that last year's crime figures show that
one out of every three white delinquents is sentenced to
confinement in a treatment center, while one of six black
delinquents goes to a treatment center. In Baltimore, only one out
of nine black delinquents was sentenced to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland's Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, according to the
Baltimore Sun, has ordered officials of the appropriate agencies to
find out why a much higher percentage of black mentally ill
juvenile delinquents than their white counterparts are sentenced to
jail instead of treatment. ``Race,'' she is quoted as saying,
``must never play a role in placement or providing treatment to
juveniles.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but unless the DMC mandate is kept alive, the racist
policies will continue _ blindly.
</P>
<P>
   A few members of the House and Senate in conference committee
will decide which provisions of the two juvenile crime bills will
be kept and which shucked in order to fashion the legislation that
will then be taken to a vote in both houses. They have only to
think ``equal before the law'' and feel compassion for children who
have taken the wrong path.
</P>
<P>
   And they will shuck right.

   FILM-GORGEOUS-DIRECTOR (Albany, N.Y.) _ ``Drop Dead Gorgeous''
might be Michael Patrick Jann's debut as a director of feature
films, but it isn't the first movie he ever made. For that, zoom
back to the mid-1980s and the hallowed halls of Albany Academy.
Jann, a sophomore, got ahold of a school videocamera and used it to

   WATER-PARK (Sheridan, Texas) _ There were plenty of doomsayers
three years ago when a group of city boosters in the tiny town of
Sheridan decided to push for a locally run water park that could
boost the small-town economy, creating jobs and attracting a few
summer tourists between San Antonio and Houston. Now the park,
about 12 miles south of Interstate-10, has been in business for a

   TRAVEL-METROPLEX (Dallas) _ Like a mismatched couple trapped in
a rocky marriage, Dallas and Fort Worth are constantly at odds.
Folks in Fort Worth often consider their Dallas counterparts
``uppity'' while many Dallasites have been known to look down upon
their Fort Worth brethren as unsophisticated rubes. Still, as
bookends in a sprawling mass known as the Metroplex, they are
joined at the hip by location and by a common desire to impress the
world. By CLIFFORD PUGH
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-DALLAS (Dallas) _ In typical Texas understatement,
tourism officials boast that Dallas offers ``more thrills than
Disneyland, more music than Nashville and more shopping than New
York.'' Strange that they don't mention ``wretched excess.''
Outside of Beverly Hills, probably no other city in the nation
exemplifies showy living and ostentatious displays of wealth. By
CLIFFORD PUGH
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-DALLAS-TREASURES (Dallas) _ Mention Dallas to almost any
adult in the world and two images come to mind: an assassinated
president and a television show.So it's not surprising that two of
the Metroplex's most popular tourist sites are a memorial to John
F. Kennedy and a homage to J.R. Ewing. By CLIFFORD PUGH
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-SUNDANCE (Fort Worth, Texas) _ Fort Worth's Sundance
Square doesn't rate real high on the ``hip quotient.'' But even
without the glitz, it's the liveliest downtown area in Texas _ and
maybe in the United States. By CLIFFORD PUGH

``Membership Certificate and Temporary Membership Card Enclosed.''

 &HT;    Ex-priest admits 1980s sex abuse past sex abuses to
investigators
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla _ Two Nashville police detectives came to
the tidy pink bungalow in Flamingo Park in February bearing dark
burdens for Frank Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some horror stories,'' they told him.
</P>
<P>
   With those words, the life Richards left in Tennessee was
resurrected in his West Palm Beach living room.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, he was known as Father Frank Richards, a Catholic
priest in Nashville who rose in the church to become principal at a
Knoxville high school.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-hour interview, Richards told the horrible
stories the detectives had heard from many of his former altar boys
and students.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, Richards sexually molested dozens of teenage boys
entrusted to his care. He was a pedophile priest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what I was doing was wrong,'' he told detectives. ``It
was a constant struggle _ just like an alcoholic who knows that he
can't drink but does.''
</P>
<P>
   The police took Richards' taped statement back to Nashville but
likely will be able to do nothing with it. All the known offenses
occurred well before he left the priesthood in 1989, and in
Tennessee, the statute of limitation is eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, 52, declined repeated requests to be interviewed for
this story. Last week, he continued to work at the new life he has
forged here in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He is employed by the state as an administrative assistant with
the Palm Beach County Health Department's division of environmental
health and engineering. He is paid $25,081.94 per year to do
computer work _ budgets, accounting and license recording.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is strictly a numbers-cruncher,'' a Health Department
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Richards does no field work and is not involved in the
regulation of day-care centers, which his division oversees, she
said. His computer is linked, however, to databases that hold basic
information _ addresses, staff sizes, class sizes _ on day-care
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Background checked out
</P>
<P>
   Health Department administrators were unaware of Richards' past
when they hired him in November 1996. They had no way of knowing
it.
</P>
<P>
   He has never been convicted of a crime, or even charged. He
apparently has never lost a civil case, or even been sued.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and FDLE background checks the Health Department made on
him came back clean, and Richards answered all questions on his
employment application truthfully: No, he has never been convicted
of a felony or first-degree misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, by his own admissions, by the referrals made by the
Catholic Diocese of Nashville, by the testimony of victims, and by
the evidence uncovered by prosecutors and police, Richards was once
an active and aggressive pedophile.
</P>
<P>
   The police statements given by Edward Joseph McKeown also
confirm this.
</P>
<P>
   Richards' longtime friend and colleague in the priesthood,
McKeown was sentenced to a 25-year prison term last month after
pleading guilty to molesting and raping a Nashville boy, part of
what prosecutors termed a pattern of abuse that involved some 30
victims over more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Both Richards and McKeown resigned from the priesthood the same
day: March 1, 1989. Prosecutors were able to convict McKeown, 54,
because he continued to claim victims in the '90s, within the
eight-year window for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Besieged with calls
</P>
<P>
   When press reports of McKeown's arrest came in February,
investigators were besieged with calls from adult men who claimed
to have been victimized as teens by him and Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had more phone calls than we can count,'' Nashville
police Detective David Zaccola told Richards during the interview
in his home. ``From as far away as Maryland _ just all over the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   During the '80s, Richards and McKeown regularly took students
and altar boys on outings that ended in episodes of sexual abuse,
according to the police statements. Many times the molestation
occurred at a farm outside Nashville that was owned by Richards'
family.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by Zaccola, Richards admitted sexually abusing
``about 25'' boys whose names he could remember. Richards said an
alcohol problem contributed to his abusive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also did a lot of drinking, and that doesn't help because I
don't always remember the things that I had done,'' he told police.
</P>
<P>
   He said he chose only boys that had reached ``physical maturity
... 14, 15, somewhere in there.'' Richards said he wouldn't ``take
kids in grade school out.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, when he was principal of Knoxville Catholic High
School, Richards was confronted by the parents of three of his
victims who complained to the diocese. Gino Marchetti, the diocese
attorney, said Richards was then confronted and admitted the abuse.
Marchetti said the church reported the charges to the state's
Department of Human Services, as required by law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public records are clear that the case was referred,''
Marchetti said. ``There's no dispute on that.''
</P>
<P>
   What is disputed, however, is why state agencies never took the
allegations to police. The state's Human Services officials say
they aren't sure what happened and that some documents about
Richards have since been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement not involved
</P>
<P>
   ``What gives me a lot of concern is that law enforcement never
got involved,'' Zaccola told Richards. ``We never knew.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid possible civil action, Richards and the diocese paid a
settlement to the three victims. He told police he put up $5,000,
the diocese lent him another $5,000, and the diocese paid $30,000
more to satisfy the families.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the charges surfaced, Richards was transferred to
Nashville and named an associate pastor at Christ the King Church.
He was told not to have contact with children and to keep his
office door open at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Richards said he was undergoing psychiatric treatment for
pedophilia during this period and did so for ``three or four
years.'' He told police he no longer has the desire to have sexual
relations with boys because he is now able to live a gay lifestyle
outside the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I wouldn't even come close to touching a kid,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Richards told investigators he moved to Florida because he had
relatives here. He worked as an administrative assistant for AIDS
nonprofit groups in Orlando and Key West before moving to West Palm
Beach in 1994 and taking a job as an admission coordinator for the
Palm Beach Kennel Club.
</P>
<P>
   Richards has received positive evaluations in his 2 1/2 years
with the Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous asset,'' wrote one supervisor. ``Mr. Richards
speaks, writes and expresses himself well,'' wrote another.
</P>
<P>
   A Health Department spokeswoman said no decision has been made
about Richards' future.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time,'' she said, ``we do not know.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards told the detectives he is certain he is no longer
capable of sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't allow myself to be in that kind of situation,'' he
said. ``There's no way I want anything like that to ever happen
again _ for my sake and for everybody else's. It's been 15 years.
I'm very confident.''

SPECIALISTS STEP UP EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE BREAST FEEDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ For too many mothers, going back to work
marks the end of breast-feeding. In some cases, moms give up the
idea, citing frustrations over not having the time or privacy to
pump.
</P>
<P>
   Others never get that far, weaning their babies before they
return to work or never bothering to nurse at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women think they just can't work and breast-feed,'' said
Patty Lane, director of the Delmar, N.Y., chapter of the La Leche
League, an international breast-feeding support and advocacy group.
``It's important for them to know that it can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   As research continues to show the benefits of breast-feeding for
both mother and baby, health specialists are stepping up a campaign
to encourage nursing, not only when babies leave the hospital but
when moms return to work.
</P>
<P>
   A federal initiative known as Healthy People 2000 wants to get
75 percent of all women in the United States breast-feeding by the
time they leave the hospital next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a woman knows that in four or six weeks, she's going to
have to go back to work and her employer won't make any
accommodations, she may have the feeling that it's not worth it to
even start breast-feeding,'' said Dr. Mary Applegate, director of
the Bureau of Women's Health at the New York Health Department,
which is planning to survey companies on their breast-feeding
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is also getting national attention. Rep. Carolyn
Maloney, D-N.Y., recently introduced a bill to Congress that would
support breast-feeding in the workplace. And last year, the
American Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement that
breast-feeding should ideally begin within one hour of birth and
continue for at least 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if your employer doesn't offer a special place to pump
or a designated refrigerator to store milk, both lactation
consultants and working moms say it's still possible to keep
nursing.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the newest electric pumps are small enough to carry in a
handbag and can operate on a battery or plugged into a car lighter,
good for women who are on the road a lot. Many pumps are also
discreet enough that women may have enough privacy at their cubicle
to use them. As for storing milk, an insulated lunch bag with ice
packs will keep the milk fresh until you get home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, it's just thinking ahead and having some
knowledge,'' said Margaret Wilkinson, a lactation consultant at St.
Peter's Hospital in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breast milk and breast-feeding promote good health in babies,
which means their mothers won't have to call in sick as often,''
said Wilkinson, citing one reason companies should be amenable to
the idea. ``It's really a win-win for the employer.''
</P>
<P>
   The health benefits of breast milk are well-documented and
growing.
</P>
<P>
   A study published earlier this month by the British Medical
Journal found that babies are less likely to become overweight
children if they are fed breast milk exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Other research has shown that breast milk helps protect babies
against illnesses, including ear infections, allergies, vomiting,
diarrhea, pneumonia and meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Breast-feeding has also been linked to a lower incidence of
sudden infant death syndrome. And since suckling at the breast is
more challenging for a baby, nursing helps develop the jaw muscles
needed to promote healthy tooth and speech development, Wilkinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides those physical benefits, early childhood experts say
breast-feeding also provides the physical contact, warmth and
closeness that help create a strong bond between mother and baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really special,'' said Dr. Marla Eglowstein, an
obstetrician and gynecologist with St. Peter's Hospital, who has
continued to nurse her 9-month-old daughter, Sophie, since
returning to work earlier this year. ``She looks at me when she's
all done and has a big smile on her face.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eglowstein often uses her own experience to explain how mothers
can both nurse and work at the same time. In her case, she
breast-feeds her baby before leaving her with the nanny in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Eglowstein then pumps at least once during the day in a special
lactation room established by St. Peter's exclusively for nursing
employees.
</P>
<P>
   When she returns in the evening, she nurses again. After putting
Sophie to bed, she'll try to squeeze in another 20 minutes with her
pump.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a private place to pump in the hospital, Eglowstein
said it's not always easy to find time in between patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a juggle,'' she said. ``We're usually just a few bottles
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The key is figuring out a routine and finding a pump that works
well, Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Some women may choose to pump less frequently, using formula to
supplement regular nursing at home. Others may want to pump two or
three times a day so their babies are fed only breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   While using a pump may seem inconvenient, she encourages mothers
to think about how breast-feeding can make their lives easier.
``You don't have to heat up a bottle or worry about sterility,''
she said. ``A lot of times it's much cheaper to breast-feed as well
as better nutrition.''

NEW DIET DRUG IS NO CURE FOR OBESITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The latest weight-loss drug, Xenical, is no
antidote to chronic laziness or a steady diet of cheeseburgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that's going to take off 100 pounds and
keep it off over the long term,'' said Dr. Sharon Alger, a
professor of medicine and clinical nutrition at the Albany Medical
Center. ``It will help you lose five to 10 percent of your starting
weight.''
</P>
<P>
   But health specialists say the newest anti-obesity drug,
approved by the Food and Drug Administration in April, may help the
seriously overweight stick with a diet long enough to alter their
lifestyle and behavior. The drug can be taken for a maximum of two
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about helping someone go through a period of making
changes,'' said Margaret Malone, a professor in the department of
pharmacology practice at the Albany Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike anti-obesity medications that suppress appetite, Xenical
works by blocking the absorption of fat in the intestines.
</P>
<P>
   For someone eating a 1,200 calorie diet, with no more than 30
percent of calories from fat, the number of unabsorbed calories
equals about 300 daily, Malone said. Over a year, studies have
shown that patients treated with Xenical and a reduced-calorie diet
lost an average of 13.4 pounds, while those on a reduced-calorie
diet alone lost 5.8 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Xenical isn't for everyone, and certainly not for people who
need to lose only 10 or 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is approved for those people who meet the federal
government's definition of obese, those who are 30 percent
overweight, or are 20 percent overweight with high blood pressure,
high cholesterol or diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, health specialists say that Xenical shouldn't be
prescribed as a first-line treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to diet and exercise first and if they are
struggling with that and are unable to lose a pound or two a week,
they may be a candidate,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Xenical works, in part, by reinforcing the need for someone to
eat low-fat foods because of potentially uncomfortable and
embarrassing gastrointestinal side-effects, including loose, oily
or accidental stools.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, also known by its chemical name, orlistat, prevents
the body from producing lipase, an enzyme necessary for the
breakdown of fats. For people on a low-fat diet, digestion under
those circumstances doesn't present a problem.
</P>
<P>
   But if you take Xenical and then splurge on cheeseburgers,
pizza, ice cream or other high-fat foods, you're more likely to
regret your decision. ``One-third of the fat you eat doesn't get
digested, so it's got to go somewhere,'' Alger said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the potential side effects, Alger said she's hearing
interest from patients who want to try Xenical, manufactured by
Hoffman-La Roche.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a number of people asking for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, however, may still be skeptical over any diet drug
since the Food and Drug Administration's 1997 recall of Redux and
fenfluramine _ half of the popular ``fen-phen'' diet combination.
The drugs were linked to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   But new pharmacological approaches to treating obesity are
increasingly popular as a tool to help people who can't seem to
lose weight on diet and exercise alone.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists caution, however, that no drug will offer a quick or
easy solution to weight loss. And the age-old remedy of eating less
and exercising more is still the best prescription.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no magic bullet,'' Alger said.

CORNWELL'S `BLACK NOTICE' IS DARK, COMPELLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Black Notice,'' Patricia Cornwell's latest forensic thriller
featuring Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Virginia's chief medical examiner
(G.P. Putnam's Sons, $25.95, 415 pages), is the author's darkest
and perhaps best.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a year since Scarpetta's lover, FBI profiler Benton
Wesley, was tortured and murdered. Barely coping with her grief,
Scarpetta gets a visit from Sen. Frank Lord, who takes her a letter
that Benton had written to her before his death and had asked the
senator to deliver a year after his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loving you was when life began,'' the letter reads. ``Now that
it has ended, your gift to me is to go on. Of course you haven't
dealt with a damn thing, Kay. ... It's time to stop dodging your
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Stubborn, intensely private, Scarpetta finds it hard to reach
out to either her niece Lucy, an ATF agent, or her good friend and
colleague, Homicide Det. Pete Marino, who has recently been demoted
to street patrols.
</P>
<P>
   Called to a crime scene at the Richmond, Va., docks, Scarpetta
discovers that the only detective there has not secured the crime
scene. Unsealing a cargo container on a newly arrived ship from
Brussels, Scarpetta and Marino find a badly decomposed male body.
</P>
<P>
   Scrawled nearby are the French words for werewolf. The only
other clues are strands of very fine hair and a strange tattoo.
After the body is removed, Scarpetta confronts the newly appointed
deputy police chief, Diane Bray, for the lack of professionalism by
the police department.
</P>
<P>
   Because the body likely began its journey in Brussels, Scarpetta
alerts Interpol of her findings. Then another body turns up _ this
one badly disfigured.
</P>
<P>
   Things begin disappearing from the coroner's office. Scarpetta's
e-mail is being intercepted, and someone has started a Dr. Kay chat
room.
</P>
<P>
   But worst of all, Lucy and her lover, Jo, a DEA agent, are
involved in an undercover operation that goes bad. Lucy kills two
drug dealers and Jo is shot. Then Interpol requests that Scarpetta
and Marino travel to Paris to assist in a murder investigation
there.
</P>
<P>
   The more descriptive forensic examination scenes may be too much
for some readers. I had to put the book down during lunch, and the
anger and pain throughout the book is so intense that I often had
to take a break. But this is a fast-paced, first-rate thriller.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Lehane's latest psychological thriller, ``Prayers for
Rain'' (William Morrow and Co., $25, 337 pages), is a taut and
enticing look at pure evil.
</P>
<P>
   Innocent Karen Nichols hires Boston private investigator Patrick
Kenzie to stop a man from harassing her. Months later, he gets a
voice mail message asking that he call her. When a naked Karen
commits suicide by jumping off a building, Kenzie feels guilty
about not returning the call and decides to find out what led her
to kill herself.
</P>
<P>
   As he looks into the last six months of her life, Kenzie
discovers that her fiance was hit by a car and remains in the
hospital in a coma. Trying to pay his medical bills, Karen
eventually lost her car, her apartment, her job and eventually her
sense of self. Believing that someone orchestrated the tragedies,
Kenzie enlists the aid of his former partner and lover, Angela
Gennaro, and his best friend, Bubba Rogowski _ big, mean and
unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Their investigation leads to a super-intelligent sociopath who
doesn't kill his victims, but drives them to the brink of oblivion.
He intercepts their mail, both incoming and outgoing; he bugs their
phones and homes. He knows their every move. But Kenzie, Angela and
Bubba begin to wage counter warfare leading to a terrifying
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides play a cat-and-mouse game in this satisfying
thriller, full of intriguing characters and sharp dialogue.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``The Heroin Factor,'' James McEachin's police procedural (Rharl
Publishing Group, $25, 340 pages), is a very dark, very tense look
at the life of a Los Angeles police lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt W. McKnight has been on the Los Angeles police force for
28 years and has only 13 days to go before he retires. McKnight
``was not a well-liked policeman. He was not known for keeping his
views to himself. Most of the whites in his division considered him
a racist. Most of the blacks thought he was aloof. He was neither.
He was a veteran of the dark streets of Los Angeles, and he was
therefore angry.''
</P>
<P>
   The last eight years McKnight has worked narcotics. He
especially gets angry when racist Capt. Ault pulls him off his
current investigation to check into the murder of vacationing Det.
Sgt. Verneau LeCoultre, one of the department's lowlifes _ a drunk,
a junkie and probably on the take.
</P>
<P>
   LeCoultre first had been attacked by a dog, escaped in his car,
been shot and then crashed the car. Now McKnight must trace
LeCoultre's final days. Eventually, an Englishwoman starts calling
and leaving messages. McKnight learns the Englishwoman is named
Leslie Van Horn. He tracks her down, but before he can arrest her,
she shoots him up with pure heroin from California-grown poppies.
By the time he is found, his mind is practically gone, and for a
year he stumbles in and out of hospitals and drug rehab. Then, he
heads for England to find Leslie and his future, and the past he
barely remembers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heroin Factor'' is a very original tale, full of anger and
yet full of hope. It is not an easy read because much of the
plot-line is very disturbing. The descriptions of heroin addiction
are gut-wrenching and vivid.
</P>
<P>
   An actor who starred in the 1970s detective series ``Tenafly,''
McEachin has successfully changed career directions.

FOX IS ON THE LAUGH TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Forget ``Costello'' and ``Holding the Baby''
for a moment, if you can remember them to start with. The folks at
Fox, home to youthful dramas, as well as animated comedies and
historically horrific live-action comedies, may have finally
figured out how to give us a funny sitcom with real people.
</P>
<P>
   Last year there was a hint of what was to come with ``That '70s
Show,'' a smart and unique take on the days of Peter Frampton and
disco.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Fox is rolling out a pair of sitcoms that stand out among a
thin field of new network comedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first priority for Fox was to come up with a half hour
that was funny, which is something we haven't done in a long
time,'' said entertainment President Doug Herzog, who came to Fox
at the beginning of the year from Comedy Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still learning the ropes but I'm really, really excited
and very comfortable with the kinds of shows we put on the air.''
Comfortable and lucky, because the two solid rookie comedies were
developed for other networks: ``Action'' for HBO, and ``Malcolm in
the Middle'' for UPN (what were they thinking?).
</P>
<P>
   (It should be noted that Fox is the network that passed on ``The
Sopranos,'' which just had a legendary first season on HBO, and
could not find a place this fall when offered ``Roswell,'' whose
pilot was the strongest among the new dramas to air this fall on
the WB.)
</P>
<P>
   The first of the promising Fox comedies is ``Action,'' a coarse
but dead-on satire of the world of Hollywood, where Jay Mohr plays
an almost amoral movie producer, and the noble conscience of the
cast is a prostitute (played deftly by Illeana Douglas).
</P>
<P>
   The other is ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' which will not premiere
until after the football season. It is the story of a regular kid
from a harried family who is unexpectedly discovered to be a
genius.
</P>
<P>
   Among Fox's other offerings: ``Ally,'' a re-cut, half-hour
version of ``Ally McBeal'' (critics have yet to see a finished
version, which will at times include new footage).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is ``Get Real,'' a promising one-hour
drama/comedy.
</P>
<P>
   For years Fox has portrayed itself as the irreverent network.
Now it might be a funny one, too.

SARATOGA SUCCESS BY THE BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saratoga opens Wednesday for a 36-day meeting, which runs
through Labor Day. New England horse players, noted for their love
of The Spa, might want to heed a few tips from Jim Mazur, author of
The Saratoga Handicapper 1999, before making their annual
pilgrimage to upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to accomplish is to provide handicappers
with information that's not out there for the general public,''
said Mazur, who has been collaborating with originater John Angelo
on the guide since 1995. ``I'm a player myself, and I was asking
questions I couldn't get answers to. Who's good with firsters? Who
are the best sires? Who's good on turf? Who's good off a layoff?
Who is this guy from Kentucky I've never heard of?
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through three years, and created a data base. Each
book is based on the last three seasons. If you go past three
years, you lose currency. We want to stay on top of it. Over the
course of three years, some barns go sour, while others get hot. We
cover a lot of ground. Some things we did last year worked, and
some didn't. But we had one of our best meetings, and that was
reflected in our sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that we're missing 90 percent to 95 percent of the
handicappers because they want a quick out. This guide is for
people who want to get into it, who want to look things up and get
a little bit of an edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazur is the author of several handicapping books, including the
Triple Crown Handicapper and Crushing The Cup. He is a frequent
analyst at Gulfstream, Woodbine, Monmouth, and the Meadowlands.
John Angelo, who began The Saratoga Handicapper as Saratoga
Scorecard in 1989, is the turf writer for the Glenn Falls Post-Star
and has been attending the races at Saratoga for more than 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``John started it,'' said Mazur. ``It was a fun thing for him.
He wanted to track what was going on at Saratoga. I had been doing
a similar thing at Gulfstream, when John called me and asked me to
take the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzur recalls a particular score that the publication pointed
out late last season. ``Jonathan Sheppard had a horse going against
Parade Ground (considered the top young turfer at the time) in the
Saranac,'' he said. ``The horse's name was Crowd Pleaser, and he
looked overmatched on the speed figures. But we've learned that
Sheppard's horses always do well at Saratoga, regardless of the
figures, and Crowd Pleaser paid 15-1. Day in, and day out, there
are a lot of little angles you can follow when you're betting. For
example, trainer John Hertler has ridden Jean-Luc Samyn seven times
in New York state-bred races, and they've won three, with three
thirds, with an average payoff of 21-1. Everybody knows about
(trainer Bill) Mott and (jockey Jerry) Bailey, but who knows about
Hertler and Samyn?''
</P>
<P>
   The Saratoga Handicapper has sections dealing with `Spa Hares,'
and `Spa Tortoises,' which divides trainers who start out well at
the Saratoga stand, from those who finish well. Since Wednesday is
Opening Day, Mazur took a look at the hares, and peeked at some
other interesting factors, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious fast starter is John Kimmel,'' said Mazur. ``But I
like to follow Barclay Tagg (who is based in Maryland), as well.
Twenty-four percent of the horses Kimmel sends out win the first
time over the Saratoga track. Michael Hushion is at 21 percent.
Rich Violette is at 25 percent. For a New England angle, Mike Aro
is at 50 percent, three winners from six starters. How's this one
in steeplechase racing? Over the last four years, five trainers
have won 91 percent of the jump races. They are Janet Elliot, Bruce
Miller, Sheppard, Richard Hendricks, and Tom Voss. Sure, they all
battle each other, and you still have to pick the winner. But why
bother with anyone else?''
</P>
<P>
   Mazur follows not only the stats of the jockeys but also their
riding styles. ``Jorge Chavez's best strength is when he's hooked
up with horses that close on the turf,'' he said. ``On dirt, he
senses the usual speed bias, and his winners are on or near the
pace. Robbie Davis is a very patient rider, and he's very good on a
stalker. Unfortunately, the best speed rider, Richard Migliore, is
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a `Bomb Squad' of riders, who average high payoffs.
Samyn averages $17. Chavez $15, which is pretty good for one of the
leading riders, and Aaron Gryder averages $14. As for
jockey-trainer combinations, how's this one? Frank Lovato and
Hushion were 3 for 5 in '98. Samyn and Hertler were 3 for 8, and
Shane Sellers and Dallas Stewart (a Kentucky connection) were 3 for
10.''
</P>
<P>
   Track bias is always a consideration, especially at a short
meet. ``At Saratoga, a lot depends on the temperature,'' said
Mazur. ``If it's hot and humid, the winners in sprints seem to all
come from the front end, with nothing coming from behind. There is
a definite bias against deep closers, especially at 7 furlongs. The
route races can still play pretty fair, because, I think, at a mile
and one-eighth (once around the Saratoga oval), they are so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both turf courses, it seems to me, play the same. Very seldom
do horses carry their speed gate to wire. You'd think speed would
be better on the inner course, because of tighter turns, but over
the last six years, only 20 percent of the winners on the inner
turf have been front-runners. The best chance to catch some
wire-to-wire winners is early in the meet because the courses
aren't chewed up yet. As for post position, going a mile and
one-eighth on the inner, where up to 12 can start, posts outside
No. 8 are 4-157 in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``On an off-track, you have to differentiate between sloppy and
muddy. Slop favors speed, mud favors stalkers. That goes for both 7
furlongs, and a mile and one-eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a few of the things we point out. At least we can
help people eliminate horses, and then they can look at the other
things that might produce a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saratoga Handicapper, which also contains sire angles for
the ever popular 2-year-old racing, is available at the bookstore
at The Spa. If you'd like a copy before you go, call
1-800-272-8039. The guide costs $21.95, plus $4 for handling, and
will be shipped via two-day mail. If you've just got to have it
now, arrangements can be made for overnight delivery.
</P>
<P>
   For a lighter look, the Daily Racing Form has introduced The
Saratoga Players' Guide. The guide, which sells for $4, the same
price as a regular Form, offers handicapping columns, analysis of
key track angles, and the charts of every race run at The Spa in
1998. For serious simulcast players, the Form also offers a likely
guide for the 42-day Del Mar meeting, which opened Thursday. Both
guides are available wherever Forms are sold.

WE'RE BRINGING OUT THE BEAST IN THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CLEA SIMON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decade of wars and genocide, these may be the headlines
that may shock us most:``Evidence Puts Dolphins in New Light, As
Killers,'' trumpeted The New York Times this month. ``Why Your Dog
Pretends to Like You'' snarled at us from the cover of this month's
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Study Exposes Craven Motive of the Brave Meerkat Sentry'' the
paper of record blared last month, picking up a report published in
the journal Science and illustrating it with an adorable picture of
the discredited creature, who looked, quite simply, stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Even discounting humans for a moment, it has been a bad summer
for mammals.
</P>
<P>
   These stories, in all fairness, are complicated reappraisals
that set new science against old misconceptions. All that we are
really learning this summer is that cute little critters can be
nasty, scheming beasts _ rather like their human counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the meerkat, a Kalahari Desert resident that
resembles nothing so much as a Disneyfied land otter, big eyes all
aglow as if awaiting its musical cue. Nothing in that round furry
face ever promised altruism, at least not to the mice and bugs it
feeds on.
</P>
<P>
   But now the meerkat is big news because it has been shown that
he and his fellows do not stand guard for their peers out of any
community spirit, but because those on sentinel duty have the best
chance to spot and escape from predators.
</P>
<P>
   True, the story concludes _ 80 lines in _ that the meerkat shows
some generosity of spirit by whistling a warning to his fellows,
rather than increasing his own chances by allowing the predator to
sate his hunger (take my den mate, please). But this meerkat
warning is dismissed as mere afterthought; ``I'm heading for the
hills, guys, and, by the way, there's a hawk behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   O tempora! O mores! But, worse than this disappointment from a
desert rat with a handsome face, is the apparent betrayal of our
companionate nonhumans, the animals we thought we knew, and that we
thought loved us.
</P>
<P>
   There is Fido, snarling up at us the moment we cease to hold the
alpha position in our home pack. And there is Flipper, not saving
hapless shipwrecked sailors, but, in the words of the gleefully
nasty chart, ``simply . . . playing with the sailors as they would
a piece of debris.'' Debris! We feed and shelter these animals (or
at least train them to carry bombs and set off depth charges), and
this is how we are repaid? It is enough to make some of us eat tuna
again, or at least get a cat, which you know will be straight with
you.
</P>
<P>
   The writers of such stories _ perhaps echoing what many of us
feel _ affect a wounded innocence. The Atlantic's Stephen Budiansky
gasps at the inherently wolfish traits in dogs, as if enlightened
self-interest were not at the core of international relations (and
most marriages) as well. He then describes breeding practices (by
humans, on dogs) dangerous enough to make any purebred petulant.
Readers can draw their own conclusions about what is behind the
sour look on the face of the retriever who graces the magazine's
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists, pet owners obviously, claim the news is not
entirely bad. They point out that we have known for years that our
warm, fuzzy neighbors were not necessarily either of those things _
emotionally speaking, that is _ to us or to themselves.
Chimpanzees, for example, have been found to war among themselves,
and even to practice cannibalism. Certain birds, long thought to be
faithful throughout life, have been caught feathering others'
nests.
</P>
<P>
   They are not noble savages; they are animals. That's their job.
As Trevor R. Spradlin, who was intriguingly identified as a federal
dolphin expert, told the Times with a firm grasp of the obvious:
``Wildlife can be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some would argue that the point in these news stories
is not that familiar creatures are newly nasty, but that we are
finally willing to accept their, well, wild natures and rise above
our innate anthropomorphism. And perhaps we are ready to leave
behind the web-footed nursery tales of Mr. Jeremy Fisher and take
him as he is, warts and all.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be a darker context, one that doesn't make us _
for once _ the mature adults who have learned to accept that
sometimes Santa Claus smells of whiskey and the Tooth Fairy
forgets. No, behind this current string of ``bad animal'' stories,
some savvy analysts have begun to detect a subtle strain of
speciesism.
</P>
<P>
   We are living in a time when ethnic cleansing has reentered our
vocabulary. When war crime tribunals have once again convened, and
something called ``compassionate conservatism'' is gaining
throughout the land. We are at a humanitarian low, and so we are
striking back _ as present-day defendants so often do _ by blaming
our family. Our mammalian family.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the ``Flipper kills baby porpoises, so what do you
expect from me?'' defense; it seems to be working. The grinning
mouth, now so clearly full of razor-edged teeth, looks up at us
from the page just as it once did from our favorite TV show and
seems to say, ``We are all in this together.'' And by imagining an
evil glint in its small and beady eye, we find the perfect
evolutionary excuse for our own beastly behavior.

satellite designed to stay in orbit for 50,000 years. When KEO
plunges back into the atmosphere, its disintegrating heat shield
will generate spectacular streamers of light. As the northern
lights fade, KEO's core, a small titanium sphere, will fall to
Earth somewhere, intact. Inside will be letters from us. A report.

   The Raytheon PRT 2000 transit system is the next best thing to
robot-driven taxis. In this system, small rail stations are spaced
about a third of a mile apart. An escalator whisks the rider up to
the elevated platform, where a vending machine sells tickets to
specific destinations. If a vehicle isn't already waiting at the
station, a central computer dispatches a single car to pick up the
passenger and as many as three companions. Talk about service!

<HEADLINE>
MLS MUST OPEN WALLET TO DRAW NAMES, TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The saga of the Revolution's acquisition of striker Ariel
Graziani highlights some of the deficiencies of Major League
Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The league is centrally controlled from New York, so player
scouting and signing is handled by the personnel department headed
by Ivan Gazidis. The bulk of the signings were accomplished in the
first two years of the league under former deputy commissioner
Sunil Gulati, but since then MLS has become less ambitious in its
pursuit of players.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of attracting names on the level of Jorge Campos, Marco
Etcheverry, and Carlos Valderrama, MLS appears to be going after
lower-profile types who might exceed expectations and establish
their reputations in the United States. A Mauricio Cienfuegos or
Mauricio Wright would be a good example of this type of performer.
</P>
<P>
   The league is apparently not interested in delving too deeply
into the international marketplace but would prefer to arrange
liasons in Latin America and the Caribbean for reasons of
accessibility and cost-effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the Revolution brought in players from England, Ghana,
Ireland, and Portugal for recent tryouts, the team might have been
wasting its time. About the same time, Gazidis was working on
connections in Mexico, and in recent days it became apparent he
could sign Graziani.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, the only MLS team with a foreign player opening,
became the prime candidate for Graziani _ though striker was not
the position they needed filled.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion set in when the Revolution appeared interested in
Joseph Addo, who could not only solve their immediate problems but
could become the best defender in MLS. After flirting with Addo for
several days, however, the Revolution announced Monday that
Graziani would be joining them.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani will likely become one of the best forwards in the
league and may be cost-effective _ if the league actually paid
substantially less than the $2 million that has been published.
Gazidis denied the league paid $2 million for Graziani but would
not confirm a fee.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, questions are raised about priorities. If the league
is interested in cost-effectiveness, it is almost obligated to
acquire Addo, since no transfer fee is required.
</P>
<P>
   The league simply will not improve if it misses out on such
bargains. There are too many weak links on MLS teams for them to be
treated seriously over an eight-month season. While MLS executives
are congratulating themselves for holding the line on costs,
attendance is not improving and will not unless the quality
improves drastically.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Revolution are not a credible team. They are in
third place in the Eastern Conference, but they have earned only 18
points in 18 matches. And they are one injury away from disaster.
They should have realized early on that the defense needs more
athleticism and variety, both in central defenders and defensive
midfielders.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution are now in position to make a trade to bolster
the defense. But they will not be able to find anyone of the
caliber of Addo. In fact, Tampa Bay is interested in Addo and could
rejuvenate itself by signing him.
</P>
<P>
   This is no way to build a soccer team. In fact, just when the
Revolution appear about to fit enough of the right pieces together,
the entire project is diverted. The philosophy _ solid, all-out
defending combined with esprit de corps _ is not being followed.
The team now has five strikers but only two central defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Again, a question is raised: How often does something like this
happen in MLS? Well, in 1996 and '97, D.C. United tried to acquire
Addo. But the league's offer was unrealistically low, no room was
left for compromise, and Addo moved to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kaviedes strikes it rich
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The going rate for top-level Ecuadorian strikers is $5.5
million. At least, that is what Celta paid for Ivan Kaviedes,
another former Emelec player who has been with Perugia in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Kaviedes scored 43 goals in 1998, the best total for any club
player. He is bigger than Graziani, mobile, and has excellent
offensive instincts. Probably no other Ecuadoran player has been
regarded as seriously as Kaviedes since Alberto Spencer in the
1960s. Even if Kaviedes is being overvalued, the trend now is for
clubs to pay for potential, and that means young players. Kaviedes
is 20 years old but mature enough to have survived in Italy.

<P>
   Celta also signed South African Benedict McCarthy, 20, who
played for Ajax last year.
</P>
<P>
   The best bargains, though, are still to be found in Uruguay. The
Uruguayans presented a group of local players, average age 23, in
Copa America and finished second to Brazil last week.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a small country _ 3 million population _ and nearly
every viable player is controlled by Francisco (Paco) Casal, one of
the world's most powerful agents.
</P>
<P>
   Casal, who represents Daniel Fonseca, Fabian O'Neill, Alvaro
Recoba, and dozens of others, has become even more ambitious. He
acquired the passes of five players by paying the club Bella Vista
$4.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Adrian Berbia, midfielder Guillermo Giacomazzi, and
Copa America stars Diego Alonso, Alejandro Lembo, and Leonel
Pilipauskas will continue to perform for Bella Vista but will
answer to Casal.

   The maze of cobalt-blue steel rails, which extends across a
parking lot and into the surrounding woods at a Raytheon test site
in Marlborough, Mass., looks like a roller coaster for the faint of
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Three rubber-tired vehicles with room for four passengers each
move quietly along a 2,000-foot-long circuit of elevated tracks.
There are no thrilling drops, crazy loops or screaming joyriders.
</P>
<P>
   But as the vehicles change tracks independently in response to
commands from a remote computer, visitors get a glimpse of a
revolutionary means of transportation that Raytheon engineers hope
will entice 21st-century suburb-dwellers to leave their cars at
home: personal rapid transit.
</P>
<P>
   The concept behind the Raytheon PRT 2000 system marks a radical
break with conventional notions of mass transit. Small rail
stations would be spaced about a third of a mile apart, a short
walk from any point in the network.
</P>
<P>
   An escalator would whisk the rider up to the elevated platform,
where a vending machine would sell tickets to specific
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   If a vehicle isn't already waiting at the station, a central
computer would dispatch a single car to pick up the passenger and
as many as three companions.
</P>
<P>
   Once loaded, the car would zip along above traffic on a
six-foot-wide guideway running 16 feet above the street, directly
to the station the rider had requested.
</P>
<P>
   The system would be the next best thing to robot-driven taxis. A
passenger would not have to follow fixed schedules or ride with
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And unlike linear systems, it requires no transfers,'' says
Raytheon engineer Steven Gluck. ``Any car can take you anywhere
within the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Advanced computerized dispatching is the hallmark of the PRT
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Miami and Detroit built so-called
``peoplemovers,'' which feature driverless rail cars that carry a
few dozen passengers at a time along elevated tracks. But the cars
are programmed to stop at every station, regardless of whether
there's anyone to pick up or drop off. This slows them to a crawl:
Cars in the Detroit system average a mere 12 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, PRT 2000 dispatch computers would calculate the
route an individual car should take and relay that information
instantaneously to the car.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the processor in the car would monitor the distance
from any car ahead. Unlike peoplemover systems, the Raytheon model
has stations set up as sidings off the main track, so when one car
stops to let off passengers, others can zip past. And because the
system is a network of linked loops, it would be easy to expand by
simply adding more loops.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon and the Northeastern Illinois Regional Transportation
Authority have already spent more than $50 million to test PRT 2000
and, if additional funding is approved, the first operational
system could be erected three years from now in Rosemont, a suburb
of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Personal rapid transit is designed for short-hop trips in the
suburbs, but longer journeys pose different problems. As new houses
_ and new workplaces _ are built farther and farther from the
centers of large cities, the automobile commute has become
increasingly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Congress allocated $30 million to the Federal Transit
Authority (FTA) for feasibility studies of a new rail system that
could whisk passengers between far-flung suburbs or the outer
suburban fringe to the heart of a city in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetically levitated vehicles, fondly known to their boosters
as maglevs, would travel either along above-ground tracks or
through underground tunnels at astonishing velocities. Maglevs
tested in Germany and Japan have been clocked at speeds exceeding
300 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the biggest obstacle to maglevs has been cost. German
and Japanese prototypes use superconducting electromagnets that
operate at subfreezing temperatures, entailing enormous
refrigeration expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Inductrack, a new maglev system developed by the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, could be the answer. Inductrack
relies on a set of conventional magnets mounted on the underside of
a train and arranged in such a way that most of the magnetic force
is placed on one side. That effectively doubles the power of the
magnets.
</P>
<P>
   Small closed coils of insulated wire are embedded under the
track to provide levitation. As the magnets pass over the tracks,
their field induces an oppositely aligned field in the coils. The
two fields then repel, pushing the train off the ground, while a
separate set of magnets accelerates and decelerates the train.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea that has yet to reach the prototype stage would
give suburbanites even more travel options than personal rapid
transit or maglevs.
</P>
<P>
   Palle Jensen, a Danish inventor, hopes to combine the
flexibility of the automobile with the high capacity, efficiency
and safety of rail in a system he calls Rapid Urban Flexible
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen envisions a fleet of small electric cars that can operate
in ordinary traffic as well as in linked trains on elevated
monorails. The cars would ride astride beams, drawing electricity
and central control from them.
</P>
<P>
   Because the longest part of any journey would be on the beam,
the system extends the effective range for electric vehicles.
Passengers would be spare the aggravation and safety hazards of
highway traffic for most of their trip.
</P>
<P>
   With elevated rail tracks crisscrossing the landscape, the
suburbs of the future may begin to resemble something out of a
sci-fi flick.
</P>
<P>
   But the alternative is unthinkable: driving in bumper-to-bumper
traffic, amidst a cacophonous symphony of car horns.

<P>
   If there are human beings on Earth in the year 52,001, and they
happen to look up to the sky one evening and find it filled with a
shimmering aurora, they can thank Jean-Marc Philippe for the light
show.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe, an artist in Paris, is the creator of KEO, a satellite
designed to stay in orbit for 50,000 years. When KEO finally
plunges back into the atmosphere, its disintegrating heat shield
will generate spectacular streamers of light. As the northern
lights fade, KEO's core, a small titanium sphere, will fall to
Earth somewhere, intact. Inside will be letters from us.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe hopes to collect billions of letters, store them on
compact disks in that titanium sphere and launch them in 2001.
Because KEO is meant to be a work of art, it will have giant wings
that will flap for a few years after its launch. Their sole
purpose? To be beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Why send messages to people we're not even sure will exist?
Philippe wants to make us _ the people of the dawning third
millennium _ think. Think about what kind of future we want to
create for our world.
</P>
<P>
   ``An artist has to say what he feels strongly,'' he says, ``and
what I feel strongly is the contradiction between a supremely
gifted species, man, which is able to measure distances in
light-years, manipulate genes, produce a Mozart, and at the same
time is able to behave, on a day-to-day basis, in a way that makes
me ashamed. To raise kids, for example, in our rich society, who
are sorry to be alive. There's a profound incoherence to our
culture. As an artist, what I want to do is stimulate the beauty of
the species, the grandeur of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising thing about Philippe's idea is that
it may actually fly. He has the support of the French aerospace
industry. Dozens of engineers in France are working on his project
for free in their spare time. He does not have billions of letters
yet, but thousands have already poured into his Paris apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe says he has room for every human to send up to four
typewritten pages, or 6,000 characters. The messages, written in
any language, will not be censored.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe is a slight man with graying hair and beard and a warm,
open, focused expression. Thirty years ago he got a Ph.D. in space
physics at the University of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``After graduation I chose to favor intuition over
rationality,'' he says. ``So I became a painter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lying outdoors on his back one summer night, watching the trace
of light left by a satellite, it came to him: Why not use space as
his canvas?
</P>
<P>
   Philippe has conceived several works of space art. In the 1980s
Philippe secured time on a radio telescope near the Loire Valley.
He offered people the chance to send personal messages to
extraterrestrial civilizations. Some 10,500 people sent letters via
MINITEL, the French data-phone network. Philippe converted the
letters to radio signals and beamed them toward the center of the
galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe has been working on KEO for nearly five years now,
without pay. Three years ago his wife, Karin Jestin, quit her job
to help him organize the project.
</P>
<P>
   To make KEO real, Philippe needed the help of engineers. The
first door he knocked on was Aerospatiale, the huge French company
that is a major contractor for the Ariane rocket and Airbus jet.
Philippe met the human resources director there, an engineer named
Patrick Tejedor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him right away that I thought it was an excellent
idea,'' Tejedor says. ``I could see it was a project that was one
part dream, one part passion and one part wonderful _ and that all
those parts might be a little difficult to realize, but that it
could be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The point in launching a time capsule into space, instead of
burying it, was to capture people's imaginations. And that is why
Philippe wants the sphere to have wings. Engineers at Aerospatiale
have helped him figure a way to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Made of a carbon composite and tightly folded to fit into a
rocket's payload bay, the wings will unfold to their full span of
33 feet once the satellite reaches its orbit 1,125 miles above
Earth. The wings will fold each time KEO passes into Earths' shadow
and spread each time the satellite returns to sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Every satellite that flies lower than geostationary orbit
(22,500 miles) is destined to fall back to Earth. And in KEO's
case, according to calculations by Marc Montagne of Aerospatiale,
it should take approximately 50,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   What actually plops to Earth will be the titanium core of the
satellite, a sphere about 18 inches across. Chances are it will
plop in the ocean, float and eventually land on some beach.
Engraved on its surface will be a map of the present position of
the continents. The organism that finds the sphere, Philippe hopes,
may be intrigued enough to crack it open and look inside.
</P>
<P>
   Inside he will find gifts. A glass plaque will show a group
portrait of humanity today. Embedded in an artificial diamond will
be four hollow gold pellets, the size of BBs, containing samples of
air, seawater, soil and human blood. A human DNA sequence will be
engraved on the diamond's surface as a kind of universal signature.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there will be stacks of compact disks, made of special
plated glass to help preserve their digital contents from cosmic
rays. Some of the disks will contain a contemporary ``Library of
Alexandria'' _ a synopsis of current human knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   But in Philippe's view the greatest gift to our descendants will
be our own personal letters. But how likely is it that KEO and its
message will be received? It may get obliterated in space by a
meteor. It may return to Earth but never be found. It may be found
but never understood _ people still argue, after all, about what
Stonehenge means, and Stonehenge is only around 4,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
   But communicating with our descendants is only half the point.
The other half is communicating with ourselves. As soon as KEO is
launched, Philippe and Jestin intend to publish all the messages.
People will learn what other people, of radically different
origins, think is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me the most important moment in all this is that moment of
personal reflection,'' Jestin says. ``You may be a little bit
changed just by having taken the time to question yourself.''

AUSTRALIA TOPS THE WISH LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If cost were not an issue, where would you like to go?
</P>
<P>
   For the third year in a row Australia tops the list of a Harris
Poll taken in June. Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales)
took second place, followed by Germany, which moved up from fifth
place a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries in the top 15 in order of popularity were Italy,
France, Canada, Ireland, Jamaica, Switzerland, Mexico, Greece,
Spain, Japan, New Zealand, and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Harris pollsters say, money is an issue, and
getting to Australia is generally more expensive _ and a longer
journey _ than going to Europe, Canada, or Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you plan an Australian trip right, it can be a
great value. For example, Qantas Vacations is offering specials to
Australia from Oct. 31 to Dec. 8 that include five nights' free
accommodations at $1,248 a person from Los Angles to Melbourne, and
from New York, a $1,648 round-trip package that includes a free
four-day, three-night self-drive Victorian Highlights tour and two
free nights at the five-star Melbourne Hotel. From April 19-May 30,
Qantas Vacations offers a $1,398 package to either Sydney or
Melbourne. For information, call 800-252-6286.

   Old home days were a tradition in Vermont and New Hampshire in
the early 20th century. Now many communities have revived the
tradition with special events, exhibits, culinary treats, and more.
In New Hampshire, these days were also for luring back former
residents to help revitalize the state's economy. New Hampshire
Preservation Alliance offers a history of old home days. For a
copy, call 603-224-2281.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, Calvin Coolidge's birthplace, Plymouth Notch, will
celebrate Old Home Day July 31 with reenactments, music, a kite
parade, a barbecue, and even free Moxie (you haven't lived until
you try this once popular New England ``tonic,'' otherwise known as
soda). Admission is free but evening events and house tours have a
reasonable admission.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Hampstead celebrates 250 years July 30-Aug. 8
(call 603-329-5789); Bethlehem celebrates its bicentennial Aug.
6-Aug. 8 (call 503-869-3386); Washington Old Home Days are Aug. 6-8
(call 603-495-3262); and from July 28-Aug. 1, history comes alive
in Portsmouth as actors playing Daniel Webster, Mary Baker Eddy,

its cafe. And, the card has become a collector's item. Each card is
produced in limited quantity and illustrated with a work from the
current exhibition, ``Cosmos: From Romanticism to the
Avant-garde,'' which celebrates the discovery and search for new
horizons through art. Another card, illustrated with the ``Crown of
Flowers'' by Cilliam Bouguereau, has replaced the museum's gift
certificate. In Europe, Smart Cards rank second after stamps among

   Bermuda dreams
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever wanted to visit Bermuda? Better still, with your
company paying all the bills? That's what happened recently for the
people who work for Jordan's Furniture stores in the Boston area.
All 1,300 employees were flown to the island for a day of fun and
sun. It's a great idea, and now Steve Belkin, president of TNT
Vacations, which arranged the outing, is out to market it to other
companies in the New England area. Belkin, needless to say, thinks
it's a great idea. And to back this up, he's been closing up shop
and taking his employees to Bermuda every five years for the last
20. In case your employer needs a reason to do a similar outing,
Belkin notes that a trip like this helps team building, is a morale
booster, reduces turnover, helps in hiring, and offers great
publicity. Add to this that it's a great value for companies.
Belkin notes it costs about 1 percent of the payroll, about $400 a
person for Bermuda. ``Do something good, and it comes back,'' said
Belkin. Employees like working for a company that does such things.
Bermuda likes the idea, too. Tourism people there feel if people
come for one day, they'll come back. Interestingly, TNT discovered
that 70 percent of Jordan's employees had never been out of the
country.

Through photos, artifacts, television commercials, and interactive

<P>
   The maze of cobalt-blue steel rails, which extends across a
parking lot and into the surrounding woods at a Raytheon test site
in Marlborough, Mass., looks like a roller coaster for the faint of
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Three rubber-tired vehicles with room for four passengers each
move quietly along a 2,000-foot-long circuit of elevated tracks.
There are no thrilling drops, crazy loops or screaming joyriders.
</P>
<P>
   But as the vehicles change tracks independently in response to
commands from a remote computer, visitors get a glimpse of a
revolutionary means of transportation that Raytheon engineers hope
will entice 21st-century suburb-dwellers to leave their cars at
home: personal rapid transit.
</P>
<P>
   The concept behind the Raytheon PRT 2000 system marks a radical
break with conventional notions of mass transit. Small rail
stations would be spaced about a third of a mile apart, a short
walk from any point in the network.
</P>
<P>
   An escalator would whisk the rider up to the elevated platform,
where a vending machine would sell tickets to specific
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   If a vehicle isn't already waiting at the station, a central
computer would dispatch a single car to pick up the passenger and
as many as three companions.
</P>
<P>
   Once loaded, the car would zip along above traffic on a
six-foot-wide guideway running 16 feet above the street, directly
to the station the rider had requested.
</P>
<P>
   The system would be the next best thing to robot-driven taxis. A
passenger would not have to follow fixed schedules or ride with
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And unlike linear systems, it requires no transfers,'' says
Raytheon engineer Steven Gluck. ``Any car can take you anywhere
within the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Advanced computerized dispatching is the hallmark of the PRT
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Miami and Detroit built so-called
``peoplemovers,'' which feature driverless rail cars that carry a
few dozen passengers at a time along elevated tracks. But the cars
are programmed to stop at every station, regardless of whether
there's anyone to pick up or drop off. This slows them to a crawl:
Cars in the Detroit system average a mere 12 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, PRT 2000 dispatch computers would calculate the
route an individual car should take and relay that information
instantaneously to the car.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the processor in the car would monitor the distance
from any car ahead. Unlike peoplemover systems, the Raytheon model
has stations set up as sidings off the main track, so when one car
stops to let off passengers, others can zip past. And because the
system is a network of linked loops, it would be easy to expand by
simply adding more loops.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon and the Northeastern Illinois Regional Transportation
Authority have already spent more than $50 million to test PRT 2000
and, if additional funding is approved, the first operational
system could be erected three years from now in Rosemont, a suburb
of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Personal rapid transit is designed for short-hop trips in the
suburbs, but longer journeys pose different problems. As new houses
_ and new workplaces _ are built farther and farther from the
centers of large cities, the automobile commute has become
increasingly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Congress allocated $30 million to the Federal Transit
Authority (FTA) for feasibility studies of a new rail system that
could whisk passengers between far-flung suburbs or the outer
suburban fringe to the heart of a city in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetically levitated vehicles, fondly known to their boosters
as maglevs, would travel either along above-ground tracks or
through underground tunnels at astonishing velocities. Maglevs
tested in Germany and Japan have been clocked at speeds exceeding
300 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the biggest obstacle to maglevs has been cost. German
and Japanese prototypes use superconducting electromagnets that
operate at subfreezing temperatures, entailing enormous
refrigeration expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Inductrack, a new maglev system developed by the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, could be the answer. Inductrack
relies on a set of conventional magnets mounted on the underside of
a train and arranged in such a way that most of the magnetic force
is placed on one side. That effectively doubles the power of the
magnets.
</P>
<P>
   Small closed coils of insulated wire are embedded under the
track to provide levitation. As the magnets pass over the tracks,
their field induces an oppositely aligned field in the coils. The
two fields then repel, pushing the train off the ground, while a
separate set of magnets accelerates and decelerates the train.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea that has yet to reach the prototype stage would
give suburbanites even more travel options than personal rapid
transit or maglevs.
</P>
<P>
   Palle Jensen, a Danish inventor, hopes to combine the
flexibility of the automobile with the high capacity, efficiency
and safety of rail in a system he calls Rapid Urban Flexible
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen envisions a fleet of small electric cars that can operate
in ordinary traffic as well as in linked trains on elevated
monorails. The cars would ride astride beams, drawing electricity
and central control from them.
</P>
<P>
   Because the longest part of any journey would be on the beam,
the system extends the effective range for electric vehicles.
Passengers would be spare the aggravation and safety hazards of
highway traffic for most of their trip.
</P>
<P>
   With elevated rail tracks crisscrossing the landscape, the
suburbs of the future may begin to resemble something out of a
sci-fi flick.
</P>
<P>
   But the alternative is unthinkable: driving in bumper-to-bumper
traffic, amidst a cacophonous symphony of car horns.

<P>
   The maze of cobalt-blue steel rails, which extends across a
parking lot and into the surrounding woods at a Raytheon test site
in Marlborough, Mass., looks like a roller coaster for the faint of
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Three rubber-tired vehicles with room for four passengers each
move quietly along a 2,000-foot-long circuit of elevated tracks.
There are no thrilling drops, crazy loops or screaming joyriders.
</P>
<P>
   But as the vehicles change tracks independently in response to
commands from a remote computer, visitors get a glimpse of a
revolutionary means of transportation that Raytheon engineers hope
will entice 21st-century suburb-dwellers to leave their cars at
home: personal rapid transit.
</P>
<P>
   The concept behind the Raytheon PRT 2000 system marks a radical
break with conventional notions of mass transit. Small rail
stations would be spaced about a third of a mile apart, a short
walk from any point in the network.
</P>
<P>
   An escalator would whisk the rider up to the elevated platform,
where a vending machine would sell tickets to specific
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   If a vehicle isn't already waiting at the station, a central
computer would dispatch a single car to pick up the passenger and
as many as three companions.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   If there are human beings on Earth in the year 52,001, and they
happen to look up to the sky one evening and find it filled with a
shimmering aurora, they can thank Jean-Marc Philippe for the light
show.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe, an artist in Paris, is the creator of KEO, a satellite
designed to stay in orbit for 50,000 years. When KEO finally
plunges back into the atmosphere, its disintegrating heat shield
will generate spectacular streamers of light. As the northern
lights fade, KEO's core, a small titanium sphere, will fall to
Earth somewhere, intact. Inside will be letters from us.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe hopes to collect billions of letters, store them on
compact disks in that titanium sphere and launch them in 2001.
Because KEO is meant to be a work of art, it will have giant wings
that will flap for a few years after its launch. Their sole
purpose? To be beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Why send messages to people we're not even sure will exist?
Philippe wants to make us _ the people of the dawning third
millennium _ think. Think about what kind of future we want to
create for our world.
</P>
<P>
   ``An artist has to say what he feels strongly,'' he says, ``and
what I feel strongly is the contradiction between a supremely
gifted species, man, which is able to measure distances in
light-years, manipulate genes, produce a Mozart, and at the same
time is able to behave, on a day-to-day basis, in a way that makes
me ashamed. To raise kids, for example, in our rich society, who
are sorry to be alive. There's a profound incoherence to our
culture. As an artist, what I want to do is stimulate the beauty of
the species, the grandeur of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising thing about Philippe's idea is that
it may actually fly. He has the support of the French aerospace
industry. Dozens of engineers in France are working on his project
for free in their spare time. He does not have billions of letters
yet, but thousands have already poured into his Paris apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe says he has room for every human to send up to four
typewritten pages, or 6,000 characters. The messages, written in
any language, will not be censored.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe is a slight man with graying hair and beard and a warm,
open, focused expression. Thirty years ago he got a Ph.D. in space
physics at the University of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``After graduation I chose to favor intuition over
rationality,'' he says. ``So I became a painter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lying outdoors on his back one summer night, watching the trace
of light left by a satellite, it came to him: Why not use space as
his canvas?
</P>
<P>
   Philippe has conceived several works of space art. In the 1980s
Philippe secured time on a radio telescope near the Loire Valley.
He offered people the chance to send personal messages to
extraterrestrial civilizations. Some 10,500 people sent letters via
MINITEL, the French data-phone network. Philippe converted the
letters to radio signals and beamed them toward the center of the
galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe has been working on KEO for nearly five years now,
without pay. Three years ago his wife, Karin Jestin, quit her job
to help him organize the project.
</P>
<P>
   To make KEO real, Philippe needed the help of engineers. The
first door he knocked on was Aerospatiale, the huge French company
that is a major contractor for the Ariane rocket and Airbus jet.
Philippe met the human resources director there, an engineer named
Patrick Tejedor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him right away that I thought it was an excellent
idea,'' Tejedor says. ``I could see it was a project that was one
part dream, one part passion and one part wonderful _ and that all
those parts might be a little difficult to realize, but that it
could be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The point in launching a time capsule into space, instead of
burying it, was to capture people's imaginations. And that is why
Philippe wants the sphere to have wings. Engineers at Aerospatiale
have helped him figure a way to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Made of a carbon composite and tightly folded to fit into a
rocket's payload bay, the wings will unfold to their full span of
33 feet once the satellite reaches its orbit 1,125 miles above
Earth. The wings will fold each time KEO passes into Earths' shadow
and spread each time the satellite returns to sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Every satellite that flies lower than geostationary orbit
(22,500 miles) is destined to fall back to Earth. And in KEO's
case, according to calculations by Marc Montagne of Aerospatiale,
it should take approximately 50,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   What actually plops to Earth will be the titanium core of the
satellite, a sphere about 18 inches across. Chances are it will
plop in the ocean, float and eventually land on some beach.
Engraved on its surface will be a map of the present position of
the continents. The organism that finds the sphere, Philippe hopes,
may be intrigued enough to crack it open and look inside.
</P>
<P>
   Inside he will find gifts. A glass plaque will show a group
portrait of humanity today. Embedded in an artificial diamond will
be four hollow gold pellets, the size of BBs, containing samples of
air, seawater, soil and human blood. A human DNA sequence will be
engraved on the diamond's surface as a kind of universal signature.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there will be stacks of compact disks, made of special
plated glass to help preserve their digital contents from cosmic
rays. Some of the disks will contain a contemporary ``Library of
Alexandria'' _ a synopsis of current human knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   But in Philippe's view the greatest gift to our descendants will
be our own personal letters. But how likely is it that KEO and its
message will be received? It may get obliterated in space by a
meteor. It may return to Earth but never be found. It may be found
but never understood _ people still argue, after all, about what
Stonehenge means, and Stonehenge is only around 4,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
   But communicating with our descendants is only half the point.
The other half is communicating with ourselves. As soon as KEO is
launched, Philippe and Jestin intend to publish all the messages.
People will learn what other people, of radically different
origins, think is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me the most important moment in all this is that moment of
personal reflection,'' Jestin says. ``You may be a little bit
changed just by having taken the time to question yourself.''

</P>
<P>
   Finally, there will be stacks of compact disks, made of special
plated glass to help preserve their digital contents from cosmic
rays. Some of the disks will contain a contemporary ``Library of
Alexandria'' _ a synopsis of current human knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   But in Philippe's view the greatest gift to our descendants will
be our own personal letters. But how likely is it that KEO and its
message will be received? It may get obliterated in space by a
meteor. It may return to Earth but never be found. It may be found
but never understood _ people still argue, after all, about what
Stonehenge means, and Stonehenge is only around 4,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
   But communicating with our descendants is only half the point.
The other half is communicating with ourselves. As soon as KEO is
launched, Philippe and Jestin intend to publish all the messages.
People will learn what other people, of radically different
origins, think is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me the most important moment in all this is that moment of
personal reflection,'' Jestin says. ``You may be a little bit
changed just by having taken the time to question yourself.''

   The maze of cobalt-blue steel rails, which extends across a
parking lot and into the surrounding woods at a Raytheon test site
in Marlborough, Mass., looks like a roller coaster for the faint of
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Three rubber-tired vehicles with room for four passengers each
move quietly along a 2,000-foot-long circuit of elevated tracks.
There are no thrilling drops, crazy loops or screaming joyriders.
</P>
<P>
   But as the vehicles change tracks independently in response to
commands from a remote computer, visitors get a glimpse of a
revolutionary means of transportation that Raytheon engineers hope
will entice 21st-century suburb-dwellers to leave their cars at
home: personal rapid transit.
</P>
<P>
   The concept behind the Raytheon PRT 2000 system marks a radical
break with conventional notions of mass transit. Small rail
stations would be spaced about a third of a mile apart, a short
walk from any point in the network.
</P>
<P>
   An escalator would whisk the rider up to the elevated platform,
where a vending machine would sell tickets to specific
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   If a vehicle isn't already waiting at the station, a central
computer would dispatch a single car to pick up the passenger and
as many as three companions.
</P>
<P>
   Once loaded, the car would zip along above traffic on a
six-foot-wide guideway running 16 feet above the street, directly
to the station the rider had requested.
</P>
<P>
   The system would be the next best thing to robot-driven taxis. A
passenger would not have to follow fixed schedules or ride with
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And unlike linear systems, it requires no transfers,'' says
Raytheon engineer Steven Gluck. ``Any car can take you anywhere
within the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Advanced computerized dispatching is the hallmark of the PRT
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Miami and Detroit built so-called
``peoplemovers,'' which feature driverless rail cars that carry a
few dozen passengers at a time along elevated tracks. But the cars
are programmed to stop at every station, regardless of whether
there's anyone to pick up or drop off. This slows them to a crawl:
Cars in the Detroit system average a mere 12 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, PRT 2000 dispatch computers would calculate the
route an individual car should take and relay that information
instantaneously to the car.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the processor in the car would monitor the distance
from any car ahead. Unlike peoplemover systems, the Raytheon model
has stations set up as sidings off the main track, so when one car
stops to let off passengers, others can zip past. And because the
system is a network of linked loops, it would be easy to expand by
simply adding more loops.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon and the Northeastern Illinois Regional Transportation
Authority have already spent more than $50 million to test PRT 2000
and, if additional funding is approved, the first operational
system could be erected three years from now in Rosemont, a suburb
of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Personal rapid transit is designed for short-hop trips in the
suburbs, but longer journeys pose different problems. As new houses
_ and new workplaces _ are built farther and farther from the
centers of large cities, the automobile commute has become
increasingly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Congress allocated $30 million to the Federal Transit
Authority (FTA) for feasibility studies of a new rail system that
could whisk passengers between far-flung suburbs or the outer
suburban fringe to the heart of a city in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetically levitated vehicles, fondly known to their boosters
as maglevs, would travel either along above-ground tracks or
through underground tunnels at astonishing velocities. Maglevs
tested in Germany and Japan have been clocked at speeds exceeding
300 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the biggest obstacle to maglevs has been cost. German
and Japanese prototypes use superconducting electromagnets that
operate at subfreezing temperatures, entailing enormous
refrigeration expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Inductrack, a new maglev system developed by the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, could be the answer. Inductrack
relies on a set of conventional magnets mounted on the underside of
a train and arranged in such a way that most of the magnetic force
is placed on one side. That effectively doubles the power of the
magnets.
</P>
<P>
   Small closed coils of insulated wire are embedded under the
track to provide levitation. As the magnets pass over the tracks,
their field induces an oppositely aligned field in the coils. The
two fields then repel, pushing the train off the ground, while a
separate set of magnets accelerates and decelerates the train.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea that has yet to reach the prototype stage would
give suburbanites even more travel options than personal rapid
transit or maglevs.
</P>
<P>
   Palle Jensen, a Danish inventor, hopes to combine the
flexibility of the automobile with the high capacity, efficiency
and safety of rail in a system he calls Rapid Urban Flexible
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen envisions a fleet of small electric cars that can operate
in ordinary traffic as well as in linked trains on elevated
monorails. The cars would ride astride beams, drawing electricity
and central control from them.
</P>
<P>
   Because the longest part of any journey would be on the beam,
the system extends the effective range for electric vehicles.
Passengers would be spare the aggravation and safety hazards of
highway traffic for most of their trip.
</P>
<P>
   With elevated rail tracks crisscrossing the landscape, the
suburbs of the future may begin to resemble something out of a
sci-fi flick.
</P>
<P>
   But the alternative is unthinkable: driving in bumper-to-bumper
traffic, amidst a cacophonous symphony of car horns.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nursing student Diane Simard posted pink fliers all over Brigham
and Women's Hospital in Boston recently, advertising a talk titled
``Another Look at Circumcision.''
</P>
<P>
   The lecture was to be presented by Simard and Ronald Goldman,
executive director of the Circumcision Resource Center, a
Boston-based group that opposes the procedure. But a half-hour
before the talk was scheduled to start, Simard was ordered to
remove the signs by Dr. David Acker, chief of obstetrics at the
Brigham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' Simard said. ``I was scared, he was so angry. He
was in my face. He said it was too controversial and he didn't want
parents to see this.''
</P>
<P>
   Acker said he merely thought a little more discretion was called
for. ``We did not stop her. We just suggested an alternative
place,'' he said. ``It was a public area where people walking by
could see in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brigham contretemps underscores how sensitive and
controversial an issue circumcision remains in the United States,
even more so since a March report by the American Academy of
Pediatrics concluded that the medical benefits of circumcision no
longer justify its use. Now, a no-cut consensus is starting to
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time, the academy recommended that if
circumcision is chosen, injections of lidocaine should be used to
prevent ``pain and physiologic stress.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger issue, according to a vocal group of advocates,
is why perform what has been called ``the unkindest of cuts'' at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is the only country in the world that
circumcises most male infants for nonreligious reasons,'' said
Goldman, author of the 1997 book, ``Circumcision: The Hidden
Trauma.'' A circumcision is performed every 25 seconds in the
United States, making it the most common of all surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   But in the rest of the world, 80 percent of males are
uncircumcised, US parents are starting to follow suit. Circumcision
rates in the country have dropped from nearly 90 percent in the
late 1960s to about 60 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the academy estimates that 1.2 million newborn males are
circumcised in the United States each year at an estimated cost of
$150 million to $270 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edgar Schoen, who oversaw the 1989 report that said
circumcision reduced the risks of urinary tract infections and
sexually transmitted diseases, dismissed the new report as ``a step
backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly biased,'' said Schoen, director of the perinatal
screening program at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland,
Calif. ``The AAP report says it is not essential to current
well-being. Well, 90 percent of what we do is not for well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoen also blamed a plethora of anti-circumcision Internet Web
sites for putting pressure on the academy. ``They stacked the
deck,'' he said. ``The AAP should have told the parents, `Here are
the advantages and disadvantages of circumcision,' and let them
make the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Wiswell, a professor of pediatrics at Thomas
Jefferson University in Philadelphia, also criticized the report,
calling it ``very negative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you weigh all the potential benefits, which start
immediately, they far outweigh the risks,'' he says, noting that
circumcision also acts as a preventative against sexually
transmitted diseases. The report agrees that circumcised males have
less chance of contracting sexually transmitted diseases, but it
concludes that ``behavioral patterns'' are far more of a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the circumcision controversy, Goldman thinks, is a lack
of education among doctors about the procedure. ``There's a huge
gap in medical education about this, and by avoiding the knowledge
we avoid the anxiety,'' he said. ``To study it would raise a
conflict, so this is the way we as a society avoid addressing that
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman also said some consent forms, such as the ones used by
Brigham and Women's Hospital, are outdated and loaded with
misinformation. For example, the Brigham's information sheet says
circumcision provides cleanliness benefits. But the report
concludes that circumcision provides no cleanliness benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's entitled to his opinion,'' Acker said. ``Most of the
consent is not in the written consent, it's in the discussion with
the nurse or doctors.''

<P>
   If there are human beings on Earth in the year 52,001, and they
happen to look up to the sky one evening and find it filled with a
shimmering aurora, they can thank Jean-Marc Philippe for the light
show.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe, an artist in Paris, is the creator of KEO, a satellite
designed to stay in orbit for 50,000 years. When KEO finally
plunges back into the atmosphere, its disintegrating heat shield
will generate spectacular streamers of light. As the northern
lights fade, KEO's core, a small titanium sphere, will fall to
Earth somewhere, intact. Inside will be letters from us.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe hopes to collect billions of letters, store them on
compact disks in that titanium sphere and launch them in 2001.
Because KEO is meant to be a work of art, it will have giant wings
that will flap for a few years after its launch. Their sole
purpose? To be beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Why send messages to people we're not even sure will exist?
Philippe wants to make us _ the people of the dawning third
millennium _ think. Think about what kind of future we want to
create for our world.
</P>
<P>
   ``An artist has to say what he feels strongly,'' he says, ``and
what I feel strongly is the contradiction between a supremely
gifted species, man, which is able to measure distances in
light-years, manipulate genes, produce a Mozart, and at the same
time is able to behave, on a day-to-day basis, in a way that makes
me ashamed. To raise kids, for example, in our rich society, who
are sorry to be alive. There's a profound incoherence to our
culture. As an artist, what I want to do is stimulate the beauty of
the species, the grandeur of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising thing about Philippe's idea is that
it may actually fly. He has the support of the French aerospace
industry. Dozens of engineers in France are working on his project
for free in their spare time. He does not have billions of letters
yet, but thousands have already poured into his Paris apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe says he has room for every human to send up to four
typewritten pages, or 6,000 characters. The messages, written in
any language, will not be censored.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe is a slight man with graying hair and beard and a warm,
open, focused expression. Thirty years ago he got a Ph.D. in space
physics at the University of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``After graduation I chose to favor intuition over
rationality,'' he says. ``So I became a painter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lying outdoors on his back one summer night, watching the trace
of light left by a satellite, it came to him: Why not use space as
his canvas?
</P>
<P>
   Philippe has conceived several works of space art. In the 1980s
Philippe secured time on a radio telescope near the Loire Valley.
He offered people the chance to send personal messages to
extraterrestrial civilizations. Some 10,500 people sent letters via
MINITEL, the French data-phone network. Philippe converted the
letters to radio signals and beamed them toward the center of the
galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe has been working on KEO for nearly five years now,
without pay. Three years ago his wife, Karin Jestin, quit her job
to help him organize the project.
</P>
<P>
   To make KEO real, Philippe needed the help of engineers. The
first door he knocked on was Aerospatiale, the huge French company
that is a major contractor for the Ariane rocket and Airbus jet.
Philippe met the human resources director there, an engineer named
Patrick Tejedor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him right away that I thought it was an excellent
idea,'' Tejedor says. ``I could see it was a project that was one
part dream, one part passion and one part wonderful _ and that all
those parts might be a little difficult to realize, but that it
could be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The point in launching a time capsule into space, instead of
burying it, was to capture people's imaginations. And that is why
Philippe wants the sphere to have wings. Engineers at Aerospatiale
have helped him figure a way to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Made of a carbon composite and tightly folded to fit into a
rocket's payload bay, the wings will unfold to their full span of
33 feet once the satellite reaches its orbit 1,125 miles above
Earth. The wings will fold each time KEO passes into Earths' shadow
and spread each time the satellite returns to sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Every satellite that flies lower than geostationary orbit
(22,500 miles) is destined to fall back to Earth. And in KEO's
case, according to calculations by Marc Montagne of Aerospatiale,
it should take approximately 50,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   What actually plops to Earth will be the titanium core of the
satellite, a sphere about 18 inches across. Chances are it will
plop in the ocean, float and eventually land on some beach.
Engraved on its surface will be a map of the present position of
the continents. The organism that finds the sphere, Philippe hopes,
may be intrigued enough to crack it open and look inside.
</P>
<P>
   Inside he will find gifts. A glass plaque will show a group
portrait of humanity today. Embedded in an artificial diamond will
be four hollow gold pellets, the size of BBs, containing samples of
air, seawater, soil and human blood. A human DNA sequence will be
engraved on the diamond's surface as a kind of universal signature.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there will be stacks of compact disks, made of special
plated glass to help preserve their digital contents from cosmic
rays. Some of the disks will contain a contemporary ``Library of
Alexandria'' _ a synopsis of current human knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   But in Philippe's view the greatest gift to our descendants will
be our own personal letters. But how likely is it that KEO and its
message will be received? It may get obliterated in space by a
meteor. It may return to Earth but never be found. It may be found
but never understood _ people still argue, after all, about what
Stonehenge means, and Stonehenge is only around 4,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
   But communicating with our descendants is only half the point.
The other half is communicating with ourselves. As soon as KEO is
launched, Philippe and Jestin intend to publish all the messages.
People will learn what other people, of radically different
origins, think is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me the most important moment in all this is that moment of
personal reflection,'' Jestin says. ``You may be a little bit
changed just by having taken the time to question yourself.''

<P>
   If there are human beings on Earth in the year 52,001, and they
happen to look up to the sky one evening and find it filled with a
shimmering aurora, they can thank Jean-Marc Philippe for the light
show.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe, an artist in Paris, is the creator of KEO, a satellite
designed to stay in orbit for 50,000 years. When KEO finally
plunges back into the atmosphere, its disintegrating heat shield
will generate spectacular streamers of light. As the northern
lights fade, KEO's core, a small titanium sphere, will fall to
Earth somewhere, intact. Inside will be letters from us.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe hopes to collect billions of letters, store them on
compact disks in that titanium sphere and launch them in 2001.
Because KEO is meant to be a work of art, it will have giant wings
that will flap for a few years after its launch. Their sole
purpose? To be beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Why send messages to people we're not even sure will exist?
Philippe wants to make us _ the people of the dawning third
millennium _ think. Think about what kind of future we want to
create for our world.
</P>
<P>
   ``An artist has to say what he feels strongly,'' he says, ``and
what I feel strongly is the contradiction between a supremely
gifted species, man, which is able to measure distances in
light-years, manipulate genes, produce a Mozart, and at the same
time is able to behave, on a day-to-day basis, in a way that makes
me ashamed. To raise kids, for example, in our rich society, who
are sorry to be alive. There's a profound incoherence to our
culture. As an artist, what I want to do is stimulate the beauty of
the species, the grandeur of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising thing about Philippe's idea is that
it may actually fly. He has the support of the French aerospace
industry. Dozens of engineers in France are working on his project
for free in their spare time. He does not have billions of letters
yet, but thousands have already poured into his Paris apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe says he has room for every human to send up to four
typewritten pages, or 6,000 characters. The messages, written in
any language, will not be censored.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe is a slight man with graying hair and beard and a warm,
open, focused expression. Thirty years ago he got a Ph.D. in space
physics at the University of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``After graduation I chose to favor intuition over
rationality,'' he says. ``So I became a painter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lying outdoors on his back one summer night, watching the trace
of light left by a satellite, it came to him: Why not use space as
his canvas?
</P>
<P>
   Philippe has conceived several works of space art. In the 1980s
Philippe secured time on a radio telescope near the Loire Valley.
He offered people the chance to send personal messages to
extraterrestrial civilizations. Some 10,500 people sent letters via
MINITEL, the French data-phone network. Philippe converted the
letters to radio signals and beamed them toward the center of the
galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe has been working on KEO for nearly five years now,
without pay. Three years ago his wife, Karin Jestin, quit her job
to help him organize the project.
</P>
<P>
   To make KEO real, Philippe needed the help of engineers. The
first door he knocked on was Aerospatiale, the huge French company
that is a major contractor for the Ariane rocket and Airbus jet.
Philippe met the human resources director there, an engineer named
Patrick Tejedor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him right away that I thought it was an excellent
idea,'' Tejedor says. ``I could see it was a project that was one
part dream, one part passion and one part wonderful _ and that all
those parts might be a little difficult to realize, but that it
could be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The point in launching a time capsule into space, instead of
burying it, was to capture people's imaginations. And that is why
Philippe wants the sphere to have wings. Engineers at Aerospatiale
have helped him figure a way to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Made of a carbon composite and tightly folded to fit into a
rocket's payload bay, the wings will unfold to their full span of
33 feet once the satellite reaches its orbit 1,125 miles above
Earth. The wings will fold each time KEO passes into Earths' shadow
and spread each time the satellite returns to sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Every satellite that flies lower than geostationary orbit
(22,500 miles) is destined to fall back to Earth. And in KEO's
case, according to calculations by Marc Montagne of Aerospatiale,
it should take approximately 50,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   What actually plops to Earth will be the titanium core of the
satellite, a sphere about 18 inches across. Chances are it will
plop in the ocean, float and eventually land on some beach.
Engraved on its surface will be a map of the present position of
the continents. The organism that finds the sphere, Philippe hopes,
may be intrigued enough to crack it open and look inside.
</P>
<P>
   Inside he will find gifts. A glass plaque will show a group
portrait of humanity today. Embedded in an artificial diamond will
be four hollow gold pellets, the size of BBs, containing samples of
air, seawater, soil and human blood. A human DNA sequence will be
engraved on the diamond's surface as a kind of universal signature.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there will be stacks of compact disks, made of special
plated glass to help preserve their digital contents from cosmic
rays. Some of the disks will contain a contemporary ``Library of

WAR TAKES TOLL ON COLOMBIA'S PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA _ Last July, only two weeks before his inauguration as
Colombia's president, Andres Pastrana shook off his security detail
and sneaked into the Andean jungles for a secret meeting with
leftist guerrilla leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The move instantly sparked hope for an end to the hemisphere's
oldest civil war, and it immediately gave the
journalist-turned-politician an image of a bold and decisive
leader.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, however, it's hard to find a Colombian who still
feels that way about the prospects for peace, or has a good word to
say about Pastrana. In the aftermath of a surge of new violence
between rebels and the army, stalled negotiations and now a failing
economy, last year's optimism has given way to this year's dread.
And Pastrana is getting much of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too soft, that's his main problem,'' said Jose Marcos
Grijalva, 33, a furniture salesman who sat outside a downtown store
that drew just two customers all last week. ``He's been too soft
with the guerrillas, and now he's being too soft with the economy.
Sometimes I wish he would just stand up and say, `Look. I'm
president and this is how things are going to be done.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks to end the conflict have been postponed twice this
year _ once in February when the rebels failed to show up, and
again last week because of disagreements over the role that
international observers will play and for a clearer definition of a
``demilitarized zone'' controlled by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting, meanwhile, has continued at an alarming pace. In a
major offensive last fall, the 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, a guerrilla group known as the FARC that
controls large areas of rural land, blew up one of the country's
main oil pilelines. Then, for a brief moment two weeks ago, another
FARC push came perilously close to the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Its smaller counterpart, the National Liberation Army, known as
the ELN and thought to have 5,000 armed fighters, has resorted to
hijacking airplanes and regularly kidnapping prominent and ordinary
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Colombians' fears about the ongoing violence are second only to
their growing anxieties over the worsening economic situation.
Stung by years of mounting government debt, growing investor fears
over the conflict and record-high unemployment, experts say
Colombia is now in the midst of its worst recession since the Great
Depression of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   As he begins the second year of his term, Pastrana's government
is trying to tackle both the conflict and the economy, but it's
confronting a pessimism as thick as the summer clouds that daily
shroud much of this country.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia has rarely been an easy place to live. For most of the
last three decades, residents have tolerated the guerrillas, the
right-wing paramilitary groups who oppose them, and have lived
cautiously to avoid the bullets, bombs or fast-striking kidnappers
commanded by the world's deadliest drug lords.
</P>
<P>
   But this remarkably resilient population is losing patience, and
more residents are choosing to leave Colombia rather than endure
more instability.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say that demand for visa applications at the
US Embassy in Bogota has reached 50,000 a month, more than double
the number last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the number of tourist visas that we issue,'' one
American official here said last week. ``What we don't know is how
many of them are coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many residents say Pastrana is too lenient on the
rebels _ especially because he gave them control of a demilitarized
area equal to 1 percent of the country's total area _ they also
blame the guerrillas, who launched their Marxist-based revolution
35 years ago but now terrorize farmers and receive most of their
funds for weapons and equipment from drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the country's mounting problems, Pastrana's
administration is still firmly supported by Washington. Unlike his
predecessor, Ernesto Samper, who was publicly linked to drug money
and corruption and roundly criticized by US officials, Pastrana has
bolstered ties to the White House and Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, President Clinton hosted a state dinner for the
Colombian leader, and Congress approved $285 million in emergency
funds, more than double the previous appropriation.
</P>
<P>
   To reinforce its commitment, Washington has dispatched US drug
policy chief Barry McCaffrey on a three-day visit to Colombia this
week to review joint anti-narcotic operations. In the past,
McCaffrey has urged Washington to triple its military aid here to
slow the drug flow from Colombia, the world's top source of cocaine
and a growing supplier of heroin.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how fierce the bloodshed has been between the army and
rebels or drug rings, previous Colombian presidents could always
count on steady growth from an economy long considered a model in
Latin America for its relatively strong middle class and productive
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
   But experts now say that the conflict and the economy have
become intertwined as more businesses close and investors pull
their money out because of concerns over the political climate,
putting unprecendented pressure on Pastrana while strengthening the
rebels' hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless it solves the economic problems, this government won't
have the political capital to negotiate a peace agreement,'' said
Maria Angelica Arbelaez, an economist at Fedesarollo, a leading
think tank. ``The technical capacity is there, but it needs to make
tough decisions and explain them.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice during the past year, Pastrana has devalued the Colombian
peso, the national currency. Earlier this month _ for the first
time in its history _ the government received a $3 billion line of
credit from the International Monetary Fund by agreeing to reform
its constitution and cut spending.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before the Colombian congress last week, Pastrana
proposed a new labor law that would reduce time off and other
benefits for workers in an effort to bring down Colombia's 20
percent unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's headaches have recently extended beyond the country's
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Fujimori, the Peruvian president known for authoritarian
methods that helped wipe out that country's Maoist rebel group, the
Shining Path, has publicly criticized his Colombian counterpart for
not using a ``mano dura'' _ a strong hand. And President Hugo
Chavez of Venezuela, who led an unsuccessful coup seven years ago,
has banned Colombian truck drivers from crossing the border in
retaliation for the terror and assaults that Venezuelan drivers
encounter on Colombian roads.
</P>
<P>
   But Pastrana's most important critics, perhaps, are those who
belong to Colombia's once-thriving middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard a flight on Sunday from Bogota to Caracas, the Venezuelan
capital, one American-educated owner of a fishing company said that
after two failed kidnapping attempts and countless shakedowns by
rebel troops over the last year, he has decided to leave his native
country to invest in a similar business in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's people like me in the middle class who have kept Colombia
stable even through years of civil war and drugs,'' said the man,
who requested anonymity. ``But we can't wait anymore. I have other
friends who have left. I know I won't be the last one.''

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I expected to hear from the folks at the AARP
this year _ just not so soon. It's several more months before I hit
their minimum age requirement of 50.
</P>
<P>
   But, sure enough, a big white AARP envelope was sticking out of
my mailbox: ``Membership Certificate and Temporary Membership Card
Enclosed.'' Inside: ``WELCOME TO AARP!''
</P>
<P>
   Countless friends had told me that part of marking one's big
Five-O in the USA is receiving an invitation to join the nation's
largest senior citizens lobby. Few of these friends were thrilled
to be included, and even fewer chose to become actual card-carrying
members of the American Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   (``You must be 50 or over. You need not be retired.'')
</P>
<P>
   I, however, have been looking forward to signing up. Among other
benefits, AARP membership gets you all kinds of discounts on hotel
rooms, tours, bed and breakfasts, restaurants, rental cars and
cruises. For example, some 3,500 Choice hotels, which include
Comfort Inns and Clarion hotels, knock 30 percent off room rates
for guests of the AARP persuasion. Sheraton shaves 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Who doesn't want a discount? More attractively (for me), the
AARP has 33 million members, making it one of the few little-guy's
special interest groups that can kick butt in Washington. Every
other organization I pay dues to is liberal, left-wing or
tree-hugging _ and about as powerful a lobby as my high school
graduating class.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe best of all, AARP dues are only $8 a year. That's about
two pennies a day, which you can find on the sidewalk if you live
in a city and keep your eyes half-open.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else I know of in life costs 2 cents a day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as I said, I wasn't looking for my invite for another
four months. If I returned my ``Certificate of Admission to
Membership'' by Sept. 1, as instructed, I'd be a cheating
49-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   I called AARP in Washington, D.C. The press office was closed
for the day _ hey, why do you think it's called an association of
RETIRED persons? _ so I asked the operator who answered the phone
what the deal was.
</P>
<P>
   ``You received a membership offer and you're not eligible?'' she
said. ``That happens. Sometimes, when you get on a mailing list, we
buy it. Like, maybe some magazine that you subscribe to.''
</P>
<P>
   I ran through the eclectic list. Who sold my name to AARP? Opera
News? Tricycle, the American Buddhist Quarterly? The Nation?
</P>
<P>
   I'll bet it was Newsweek. The only reason I get Newsweek is
because it was part of a gifts package for joining KQED, the local
PBS television station. (All I'd wanted was the ``Roy Orbison and
Friends'' videotape.)
</P>
<P>
   KQED recently admitted that it twice leased its mailing list to
the Democratic National Committee and twice to Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif. How big a leap is it to suspect Newsweek would hand KQED's
members over to AARP?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our marketing department buys the mailing lists,'' the
operator continued. ``Anything anybody signs for can end up on one.
Like, students sometimes get our offers because they signed for
something for their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   I told the woman that I'd just figured the AARP knew my 50th
birthday was coming and jumped the gun. She laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean like we'd know? It was just a coincidence,'' she
said. ``We have mailing lists but we don't have any mechanism to
determine when you turn 50.''
</P>
<P>
   And all this time I'd pictured a vast computer in the basement
of 601 E Street in Washington, D.C., that is wired into Social
Security or Birth Certificates, Inc., or whatever, and would
automatically spit out the names of the Americans who hit their
official ``You Are Now Entering Geezerhood'' birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. Ask again in a few months, AARP. If you'll kick
congressional butt for me, I'll give you eight bucks a year until I
die.

BIZKIT TAKES LEAD IN RAP-METAL REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget all that hoopla about Latin pop, which is far more pop
than Latin, which will fade long before Ricky Martin stops shaking
his bonbon. What's making the biggest racket these days is
take-no-prisoners, make-your-ears-bleed hardcore rap and heavy
metal, which Limp Bizkit is elevating to new levels.
</P>
<P>
   In the August issue of Spin magazine, the one that has cover
boys Limp Bizkit in an almighty twist, Zev Borow writes of the
band: ``Dredging up youthful anger and rebellion is one thing,
taking it somewhere is another. Simply put, Limp Bizkit have yet to
write a truly good song.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so knuckleheaded charmers like ``Nookie'' and ``Break
Stuff'' aren't exactly ``Stardust'' or ``Hey Jude.'' But Spin's
observations _ however piquant, and perhaps even true _ really miss
the fact that Limp Bizkit is crafting a likely blueprint for
popular music as we careen into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, Limp Bizkit is the Jacksonville, Fla.-based
quintet that made industry types sit up and pay attention when the
band's sophomore effort, ``Significant Other,'' entered the
Billboard Album Chart at No. 1, drop-kicking the insipid Backstreet
Boys out of the penthouse for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Led by gleefully bombastic Fred Durst, the band makes music
that's all battering-ram rhythms, rhymes, and badass attitude,
equal parts Metallica and Tupac.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly other bands, most notably Red Hot Chili Peppers, Korn,
Rage Against the Machine, Kottonmouth Kings, and Biohazard, have
splashed about in these waters before, injecting their metal and
rock with healthy doses of funk and/or hip-hop. Rapper Ice-T
cranked up the volume, and ticked off just about everyone with his
thrash-metal outfit, Body Count, and the Beastie Boys have never
shied from the potent scream of guitars to bulk up their rhymes.
</P>
<P>
   And recently, there have been such
``Hey-you-got-peanut-butter-in-my-chocolate'' collaborations as
Busta Rhymes and Ozzy Osbourne on Busta's ``This Means War,'' which
samples Black Sabbath's ``Iron Man''; Puff Daddy and Jimmy Page's
``Come With Me,'' an unforgivable bastardization of Led Zeppelin's
great ``Kashmir''; and hard-to-find, wickedly slinky ``Bounce,''
which joined Rage Against the Machine and Snoop Dogg.
</P>
<P>
   But more than any other current band, Limp Bizkit, which
performed at last weekend's three-day love, music, and rioting
festival, Woodstock '99, has brought to fruition the delicious
possibilities Run-DMC hinted at more than a decade ago on such
classic tracks as ``Rock Box,'' ``King of Rock,'' and, of course,
their tag team with Aerosmith on the latter's ``Walk This Way.''
</P>
<P>
   With all that background-beat science, the boys of Bizkit _
Durst, along with guitarist Wes Borland, bassist Sam Rivers,
drummer John Otto, and DJ Lethal, who worked the wheels of steel
for House of Pain _ have created a metal album you can mosh and
dance to. It's a recognition of the groove underlying Metallica's
``Enter Sandman'' and Nirvana's ``Smells Like Teen Spirit,'' and a
shout-out to the metal-toothed snarl of N.W.A's ``Straight Outta
Compton'' and DMX's ``Get at Me, Dog.'' They're making records both
derivative and quite unlike anything else.
</P>
<P>
   With his old-school, shell-toe Adidas (bet he knows all the
words to Run-DMC's ``My Adidas'') and backward baseball cap, Durst,
who considers himself more a rapper than singer, has all the
pretty-fly-for-a-white-guy moves down. And unlike the grunge
crybabies of yore who were all bollixed up about the horrors of
fame, Durst, bless his megalomaniacal heart, revels in it, crowing
about his desire to blow up as a rap-metal mogul, comparable to
rapper-entrepreneur Master P. (He may be on his way; his label,
Interscope, recently named Durst a senior vice president, to
oversee producing, remixing, signing new acts, and directing
videos.)
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just Puffed-up posturing. Durst knows he and the
Bizkit boys are onto something with ``Significant Other,'' a
sizable stylistic leap from their debut, ``Three Dollar Bill,
Y'all$,'' and its chainsaw cover of George Michael's ``Faith.''
Durst is serious enough to trade lines with rap luminary Method Man
on ``N 2 Gether Now,'' and while he doesn't embarrass himself, no
one is going to confuse Fred D with Chuck D when it comes to his
flow on the mike.
</P>
<P>
   But that, like Spin's lament, is also beside the point. Limp
Bizkit's influence should not be denied, and while the band is not
the first shot in the rap-metal revolution, it is the most
successful. Other artists such as Kid Rock and Sevendust, both of
whom also played Woodstock '99, are also finding acclaim and
listeners. Perhaps few realize it now, but ``Significant Other''
may come to be regarded as important a musical touchstone as Dr.
Dre's ``The Chronic'' or Nirvana's ``Nevermind.'' And that's not
too bad for a bunch of guys who did it all for the nookie.

STUCK IN DENIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm an honest man, a God-fearing man with a wife and kids. I try
to see things as clear as I can, and I don't mean anybody any harm.
I'm about like any man who goes into the office every day and tries
his darnedest to do the best job he knows how. As a loan officer at
this fine institution, I try day-in and day-out to make the right
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   I've been in this spot before. I've seen men like this wanting a
helping hand from us, and I know full well what I'm thinking, I
know which way I'm leaning. But I'll be as thorough as a man can
be. I'll take my time, step-by-step, so Mr. Childs will know we are
fair, and friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Childs, I see here you had a little trouble with credit at
another institution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir. We missed one payment. But that was five years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh huh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On account of an illness in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is when you run a small business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then we've never missed another single payment. And the
business is growing every year. We'd like to grow some more now
with your help in the way of this small loan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Childs is enthusiastic, charming even. He is probably a good
businessman. But looking into his face, I don't know. I just see
something that scares me. As a loan officer, I have to be sensitive
to my instincts. And there's something there _ something in that
face screaming the one word we in this business can't tolerate:
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, it has nothing to do with the obvious. I am not a
biased man. I am aware of the latest studies, and I give them no
heed. There's that one by a Dartmouth professor who analyzed
Federal Reserve Board data on more than 4,600 small businesses. It
found that 66 percent of blacks were denied loans for their small
businesses, while 27 percent of whites were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Even Alan Greenspan, our superhuman Fed chairman, worries about
the studies. He has said, ``To the extent that market participants
discriminate _ consciously or, more likely, unconsciously _ credit
does not flow to its most profitable uses.''
</P>
<P>
   My response is identical to that of the chief economist of the
American Bankers Association, James Chessen, who calls the studies
inadequate. ``They cannot capture the decision-making of loan
officers,'' he rightly pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   And so I look into Mr. Childs face and, try as I might, I still
cannot get over my fears. ``You have been denied loans on two
occasions, is that right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mystery to me. All I know is I got the one loan and was
denied two others.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous denial _ that worries me. What might I be missing, if I
approve this loan, that others saw. I'm looking into his face
again, and I see what I need to see. I'm convinced now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Childs, you keep your business account at this bank, don't
you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir. I thought it might work in my favor if I came to you
for the loan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted to have your business account. But, Mr.
Childs, I'm afraid we have to deny your application for a loan.
It's really nothing personal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir. I've heard it before. Please don't mind my asking:
If it's not personal, then what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Mr. Childs, it's like this: I'm just not comfortable
with what I see _ on paper, of course.''

READING BETWEEN THE LINES AT AMAZON.COM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Bezos has made losing money fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of Internet retailer Amazon.com has repeatedly said
that his young company shouldn't worry about earning money while it
is in a building stage. ``It would be a terrible mistake to be
profitable now,'' he told CNBC recently.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part Wall Street has bought the argument. Investors
have greeted Amazon's losses as a necessary evil, the price the
company must pay today for future greatness.
</P>
<P>
   But attitudes may be changing. When Amazon last week said it
lost $138 million in the second quarter, and forecast growing
losses in the quarters ahead, the stock lost 15 percent of its
value in a single day. It fell further Monday. At 105 15/16 a
share, Amazon is down 50 percent from its April high.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises an interesting question: When does losing money
stop being a good thing and become something to worry about?
</P>
<P>
   Amazon certainly isn't the first company that has forced
investors to confront the question. Entire American industries have
been built on a foundation of red ink. Cable television is a prime
example.
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies have borrowed billions to wire America's
households. The huge borrowings _ and big interest payments _ all
but guaranteed the companies would lose money. When AT&AMP;T bought
Tele-Communications Inc. last year, the cable giant was still
racking up quarterly losses. Yet that didn't stop AT&AMP;T from paying
$31 billion for TCI.
</P>
<P>
   How come? Like other investors, AT&AMP;T figured that when the
industry's building phase finally ends, cable's losses will morph
into big profits.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T made a similar calculation when it paid $12 billion in 1993
for McCaw Cellular Communications, a big cellular company. As an
independent company, McCaw never made a dime. Once again,
construction costs overwhelmed everything else. But AT&AMP;T bet,
correctly in this case, that cellular would make money down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Few industries have tested investors' patience like
biotechnology. New drugs can take more than a decade to develop,
and during that phase, biotech companies don't even have revenues
to show for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Sepracor, a Marlborough company that tries
to produce safer versions of existing drugs. The firm has lost
money every year in this decade. In its most recent quarter,
Sepracor lost $36 million, twice what it lost in the same quarter a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the firm has a market value of more than $2 billion. In
effect, investors are willing to make a leap of faith that
Sepracor's investments will eventually produce drugs and profits.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Bezos mentioned USA Today and CNN as
examples of businesses that took a long time to produce profits. He
could have mentioned Sports Illustrated, which lost money for a
decade before going on to become a great success.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Anderson, president of Boston's Yankee Group, expects
Amazon.com to evolve in a similar way. ``Bezos is doing exactly the
right thing,'' he says. ``He is building warehouses, he is hiring
the right people. Whether he makes money or loses money is
irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon mentioned big investments in warehouses and a one-third
hike in staff, to 4,200 people, to explain its $138 million loss
last week.
</P>
<P>
   But others aren't so sure the Internet retailer is on the right
track. Put Larry Haverty in the camp of skeptics. A senior vice
president at State Street Research, Haverty can't see where
Amazon's big profits are going to come from. He says there has
never been a retailer in history that reached Amazon's current size
_ over $300 million in quarterly sales _ that didn't make money.
</P>
<P>
   He calls most of Amazon's products ``commodities,'' and
questions the firm's decision to sell such a wide range of wares.
``No retailer in the world is competent enough to master all those
businesses,'' he says. Amazon started out as a seller of books but
has since expanded into music, auctions, toys, and electronic
products.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Moore sees another problem. A money manager with Jurika &AMP;
Voyles in Oakland, Calif., Moore points out that while Amazon's
sales are still growing explosively, the rate of growth is slowing
at a time when expenses are rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give investors time, they will do the arithmetic and
there will be a reversion to sanity,'' he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice if there were some simple way for investors to
sort out the ``good'' losses from the ``bad'' ones. Alas, life is
not that simple.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the investor in fledgling companies is in much the
same position as a scout trying to assess the prospects of young
pitchers. Which hard thrower is going to turn into the next Sandy
Koufax and which ones are going to ruin their arms or never learn
to put the ball over the plate?
</P>
<P>
   Will Amazon.com be the next Koufax or the next overhyped phenom?
It's hard to say _ which is what makes baseball and investing so
much fun to follow.

REVOLUTION ADD GRAZIANI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when it has become obvious the Revolution need high-level
help in central defense, they have acquired a high-scoring striker.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Jose Graziani, who has scored 34 goals in the last two
years in Mexico, was officially assigned to the Revolution by Major
League Soccer Monday and could be available for their visit to
Tampa Bay Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani, 28, is expected to become one of the top offensive
players in MLS.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution should probably be concentrating more on
defensive improvement, both on the back line and midfield,
following home losses to Los Angeles (5-2) and D.C. United (2-0).
They surrendered midfield possession for much of the first half in
Sunday's game, and United capitalized by scoring twice in the first
33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Revolution were apparently moving toward adding
defender Joseph Addo last week, but changed direction after the
league signed Graziani. This leaves the Revolution with five
strikers and two central defenders, and will likely lead to other
moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ariel Graziani is a player we have had our eye on for some
time,'' MLS deputy commissioner Ivan Gazidis said. ``There are a
number of teams interested in him. He is one of the most elegant
strikers in Central and South America and one of the most prolific.
He is great to watch and he will score goals in the MLS.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the assignation seems strange, since Joe-Max Moore
has been on a scoring streak and the Revolution's vulnerabilities
are elsewhere. But Revolution player-coach Walter Zenga can be
faulted for not recognizing the team's need for more athleticism,
experience, and variety in central defense sooner. Yet, there were
no guarantees MLS would have been able to procure the type of
player Zenga requested.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Zenga had hoped to acquire an outside right midfielder
until recently. But after the Revolution were crushed by Los
Angeles, and central defender Dan Calichman suffered a hip injury
against D.C. United, the team's defensive needs have become more
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the Revolution's choice,'' Gazidis said. ``If they
had preferred a defender, we could have helped them. They could
have passed on Graziani. I would have no problem negotiating with
Joe Addo, or whoever they want. It's not an easy choice for them,
because they are hurting for numbers defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziani, a native of Villa Empalme, Villa Constitucion,
Argentina, began his professional career in 1993 with Newell's Old
Boys in Rosario. The next year, he moved to Sport Boys of Peru,
then to Aucas and Emelec in Ecuador. Graziani scored 52 goals in 69
games with Emelec, became a naturalized Ecuadoran citizen, played
for the national team in World Cup qualifying and Copa America, and
has scored 12 goals in 21 international appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Graziani scored 20 goals for Veracruz in Mexico, then
produced 14 goals for Morelia this year. His teammates have
included Diego Maradona in Argentina and Alexi Lalas and Revolution
striker Joe-Max Moore in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no doubt in our minds as an organization
that we want Ariel Graziani on this team,'' Revolution general
manager Brian O'Donovan said. ``We believe that he is a very
big-time player who will have a major impact on whatever team he
goes to. We are celebrating the addition of a high-impact player,
in spite of our defensive weaknesses, which we can correct.''

   CENTERVILLE, Mass. _ Lance Richardson is describing what it's
like to fly on water _ flipping, twisting, and soaring across the
wake of a towboat, pulling off gravity-defying stunts with offbeat
names like ``Bel Air,'' ``Tantrum,'' and ``Air Raley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel my body totally extended,'' said Richardson. ``It's
quiet. I feel weightless looking down at the water . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   His tricks have onlookers gaping as he rides his wakeboard, the
offspring of the surfboard and the water version of the snowboard.
</P>
<P>
   Around large lakes and on rivers where speedboats chalk the
water, wakeboarding is growing quickly, said Michael Reardon, head
of the new wakeboarding department at Sea Sports in Hyannis. ``More
and more people have come in asking for bindings and boards.'' From
winter snowboarders, twitching for a summertime alternative, to
first-timers, wakeboarding is establishing itself as a summer
pastime and a competitive activity.
</P>
<P>
   As in waterskiing, a wakeboarder is towed behind a boat while
holding a length of rope, but the similarity pretty much ends
there. The boarder is towed at 20 to 25 miles an hour (slower than
waterskiing because wakeboards hydroplane easier) about 60 feet
behind the boat. The boarder's feet are in loose toeless boots _ so
he can slip out when he must _ in a skateboard, surfboard, or
snowboard position.
</P>
<P>
   A standard board is 4 feet long and is made of fiberglass,
plastics, and carbons. Because it has neither a front nor a back,
and has fins at both ends, it can be ridden in both directions,
giving rise to dozens of complicated and dynamic tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wakeboards are so much more versatile than water skis,'' said
Reardon. There are front flips, back flips, twists, and spins, and
creative variations on those moves. Many tricks bear the same names
as snowboarding. But instead of half pipes or jumps of
snowboarding, this sport uses the water wake to elevate.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, 24, from Exeter, N.H., even has a sponsor, Hyperlite
wakeboards, an industry leader. He was a gymnast and a snowboarder
when he first tested the waters four summers ago. By his second day
on a wakeboard, he said, he was landing flips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wakeboarding is a totally different feeling than
skateboarding, but it's a lot like snowboarding. The biggest
difference is that you're out in the sun in warm water,'' said
Richardson. He said there are fewer injuries, since the water's a
cushion, ``and you don't have to pay $50 each time you go,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, wakeboarders, like downhill and water skiiers, need to be
cautious, particularly as novices. The combinations of wind, water,
and speed can prove tricky. Instruction can help smooth the
learning process.
</P>
<P>
   A recently established water sports school, Above The Glass, in
Centerville, offers wakeboarding lessons. ``There are so many
people who want to do it . . . even adults are trying it, because
waterskiing can get boring,'' said Marc Morin, shop cofounder and
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I'm trying to get my footing on a piece of ice,''
said first-timer Kevin Connolly, 28, on vacation from Chicago,
``but it's more fun than waterskiing.'' Connolly, who was up on the
water after the first pull of the boat, said he intends to switch
over from waterskiing.
</P>
<P>
   The school uses a Mastercraft X-Star, the boat used for the ESPN
X-Games competition that awards the biggest purses and is the most
publicized of wakeboarding tournaments. The boat has a special
wakeboarding pylon, an arched tower that cradles the middle of the
boat and sits 10 feet high, allowing the boarder to snare even more
air. Depending on how much weight's on the boat, there are four
sacks that can be filled to add 1,000 pounds to augment the wake.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's the snowboarding of watersports, wakeboarding so
far has avoided the hog-the-slope image of some hot-shot
snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's appearance may be on the edge _ right eyebrow
pierced, hair dyed red and black, an earring, a tongue ring, a
tattoo of a harlequin on his right shoulder and a personal design
on his left _ but he's a strong athlete with a commitment to his
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance will try anything. He has no fear,'' said Morin,
describing how Richardson goes to great pains, figuratively and
literally, to learn new stunts. Two years ago, Richardson knocked
himself out when he slammed into the water on his back, trying an
Air Raley _ a trick in which his body is fully extended at least 10
feet over the wake in a Superman pose.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is an amateur but would like to become a
professional. Representing New England, he placed sixth last summer
in the advanced division of the International Novice Tournament in
Austin, Texas. He hopes to compete in pro competitions this season.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of wakeboarding, about a dozen years ago, was
essentially a transition beyond ``skurfing,'' which used a short
one-directional surfboard with bindings, towed behind a boat. The
sports's equipment is being improved all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology of the boards has come up to speed, and it's
just a matter of time before people start investing in the sport,''
said Richardson. Wakeboards with bindings range from $300-$1,000.
Lighter boards are deemed superior because they allow for higher
jumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make it an aggressive sport, or a relaxing sport,''
said Richardson. Either way, wakeboarding is carving a niche.
``Hey,'' Morin said, ``it's the 90s at the brink of the millennium.
Wakeboarding is the new wave of style.''

IT'S A SUMMER JOB FOR CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You had to keep reminding yourself that this was not the real
NBA. Coach Larry Bird was wearing shorts and had his bare feet
slipped into loafers. He signed autographs at halftime. Red
Auerbach spent most of the afternoon sitting at the scorer's table.
Players wore uniforms that appeared to be straight off the discount
racks of a local sporting goods store. Rick Pitino sat in the
bleachers and, during one bizarre moment, was approached by an
extremely tall fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you tell me what leagues I should be playing in?'' the
young man asked Pitino. The coach said he didn't know. ``Well,''
the man followed up, ``can you point out some agents in the
crowd?''
</P>
<P>
   That was just the beginning. There was also a German Select Team
forward named Boniface Ndong, a 6-foot-11-inch, 180-pounder who can
pass for a reed stalk anytime he wants. Not to be overshadowed, the
Nets brought 5-4 Shawnta Rogers to the court. If you can believe
this, Rogers actually looks smaller than 5-4 when he's on the
floor. In fact, if I were a coach, I would put 5-3 Muggsy Bogues on
my team _ I say Muggsy towers over Shawnta _ and have him post up
Rogers on each possession.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the opener of the Celtics' eight-team Pro Summer
League at UMass-Boston. This was the place to come if you wanted to
forget about the limiting boundaries of reality. Unless, of course,
you happen to draw your paychecks from the Boston Celtics. People
associated with the Celtics were the only ones who were constantly
reminded of the outside world, even when everything inside was
clearly artificial.
</P>
<P>
   I have many reasons for saying that. Here's one: Pervis Ellison
_ who has played in 39 games since Bill Clinton was reelected in
1996 _ was expected to play. He didn't. He told Pitino that he
wanted to play, but the Coach thought it would be best to rest him.
There were several people in the building who clearly got caught up
in the Fantasy NBA atmosphere at UMass, because many of them
acknowledged aloud that they were here to see Ellison. They also
acknowledged that they were disappointed when the center did not
appear with Wayne Turner, Tony Battie, Walter McCarty, and the rest
of the Celtics against the summer-vacation Wizards. (The Celtics
pounded the makeshift team, 98-77.) Maybe they all know the truth,
which is that if Ellison doesn't play in any of this week's games,
he probably won't play with the Celtics again.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison was not the only reminder that this Summer League world
was false. You want to know the best player of the day? Austin
Croshere. He dropped 30 points and had 11 rebounds against the
German team which, by the way, isn't loaded with a lot of Germans.
The only Pacer who looked nearly as impressive was Al Harrington.
Keep in mind that Harrington did not make the Pacers' playoff
roster and that Croshere played only a few more minutes than you
did throughout the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   But Harrington made some moves Monday that were breathtaking.
You wanted to lean back on the wooden bleachers here, gaze at the
quaint overhead banners that read ``Little East,'' and smile about
the artistry of basketball. But if you were Pitino and tried that,
there was always a question that brought everything back to real
time.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Ron Mercer situation. ``Based on his comments,'' Pitino
said with a laugh, ``we're not close (to signing him).'' Mercer
said the Celtics' offer to him was drastically below what he
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget about the Greg Minor story. There are those in the
organization who fear that the guard's career is over. He suffered
a severe hip injury late in the season in Miami. He is walking with
a cane now. Pitino said you usually don't see injuries like Minor's
unless you are looking at a car wreck or a pileup on a football
field.
</P>
<P>
   And, before we go back to that quirky, unrealistic NBA, there is
also the Dwayne Schintzius story. Supposedly, the team can't find
the 7-2 center. The Celtics wanted him to participate in the Summer
League. His contract is guaranteed until Dec. 31, so one team
official cracked, ``I hope he gets his money protected from Y2K
before he leaves town.''
</P>
<P>
   The fake NBA seemed to be much more fun than the real one. There
are always complaints about fans not being into the game, but
anyone who watched Turner couldn't say that. Turner is from Mission
Hill, so he had several of his friends and admirers behind the
Celtics bench. They cheered when he dribbled. They cheered when he
passed. He made a nice floater near the end of the first half and
they high-fived each other. Once, Frank King threw a low pass to
Turner that went off his leg and out of bounds. Wayne's World
wanted it to be known that their man was not responsible for the
turnover.
</P>
<P>
   There were other refreshing stories. If you don't like the
Knicks, you can be assured that they did not make a good decision
by drafting French center Frederic Weis (he can't play). If you
like underdogs, you will enjoy hearing that Celtic camper Adrian
Griffin most likely will be signed by the team in early August. If
you like to see coaches laugh, you would have loved to see Bird
giggling at Jason Miskiri when the guard asked out of the game.
Miskiri had been hot when he raised his hand toward the bench. Bird
looked at him, laughing, and said, ``You want to come out NOW?''
</P>
<P>
   No way this was the NBA of tough injuries, base-year
compensation, trading deadlines, and free agent signing periods. It
was light. It was loose. It was fun. But, as the Celtics know, this
camp lasts only a week.

US MEN PLAY ARENA FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUADALAJARA, Mexico _ The Mexican with the microphone wants to
know what the US men's soccer team learned from watching the US
women win the World Cup. Bruce Arena gives him the amused stare he
uses with people who ask him silly questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You actually think we learned something from watching the US
women?'' the US men's coach says. ``We didn't learn anything. Their
accomplishment was tremendous, but it doesn't apply to our sport.
In our country, we have an expression: It's like comparing apples
and oranges.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Babes of Summer beat the Chinese and put
themselves on magazine covers, Arena has been talking to people who
don't know one orchard from another. ``There are American
journalists who think Mia Hamm could play for our team,'' Arena
says, shaking his head. ``Our women couldn't beat our under-16 boys
team. If you have to explain that . . .''
</P>
<P>
   That's a typical Arena assessment _ blunt and realistic. His men
may be 5-1-1 this year with shutouts over Germany and Argentina but
it'll be a year, he says, before they're a good national team. The
US federation's Project 2010 is a great idea, he says, but anyone
who thinks the Americans can win the World Cup by then is dreaming.
And winning the FIFA Confederations Cup here against the likes of
Brazil and Mexico would be nice, he says, but it doesn't mean the
Yanks will qualify for the next Mondial in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Arena watched them go three-and-out (with the worst goal
differential in the 32-team field) at last summer's World Cup in
France. He knows exactly what's in his talent pool because most of
the players competed for or against him in Major League Soccer or
on the 1996 Olympic team that he coached. And he knows what's a
realistic goal _ to create a team that's competitive with the
Mexicans and that doesn't have to go down to the wire to make it to
the Mondial.
</P>
<P>
   That's not going to happen overnight and Arena knows it. That's
why he insisted on a contract that takes him all the way through
the 2002 Cup (unlike predecessor Steve Sampson's, which only went
until the end of qualifying). ``I made that clear from Day 1,''
Arena says.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be rebuilding from Ground Zero, but his roster is
decidedly imbalanced between gray and green. The team Arena put on
the field against New Zealand Saturday had Cobi Jones (116
international caps), Jeff Agoos (93), and John Harkes (87) at one
end and Eddie Lewis (9), Carlos Llamosa (4), and Richie Williams
(4) at the other.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it's going to be for the next year and more, as
Arena tries to win and build at the same time. Nothing unusual
there, he shrugs. It's the same for the Brazilians, the Germans,
and everyone else in the post-Cup year.
</P>
<P>
   So far Arena has managed to do both, while moving past the
bitterness and finger-pointing that marked the Yanks' abrupt and
sour seance in France. ``It's night and day here right now,'' says
former captain John Harkes, whom Sampson dropped from the squad
before the Cup but whom Arena asked back for this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   An atmospheric change was inevitable once Sampson resigned. And
the unhappiest people on the Cup squad _ Tab Ramos, Alexi Lalas,
Eric Wynalda, Preki Radosavljevic _ haven't played this year and
may not again. But much of the change, players say, is due to Arena
and his simple, straightforward approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just his common sense with things,'' says Harkes, who
played for Arena at both the University of Virginia and D.C.
United. ``He understands. He knows what players are like.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena was a player himself, a keeper at Cornell (he blanked
Harvard in the 1972 NCAA quarterfinals) who earned one cap (against
Israel) for the US team and played professionally in the American
Soccer League. As coach, he won five NCAA titles in 18 years at
Virginia, won two MLS crowns in his first two years with D.C.
United, and directed the 1996 Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   While Arena's credentials are beyond reproach, what's won over
his players is his no-nonsense style. No Mickey Mouse, no mind
games. ``He tells you exactly where you stand,'' says Agoos, who
also played for Arena at both Virginia and D.C. United. ``If you're
the No. 1 star or a guy on the bench, he'll tell you the way it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena is direct and demanding, but he's also approachable and
flexible. ``He doesn't micromanage things the way a lot of coaches
do,'' says Agoos. ``He allows you to express yourself freely within
a system. He allows you to be the player you are _ as long as you
get the results.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way Arena was at Virginia, where he was hired as head
soccer and assistant lacrosse coach (he'd been an All-American at
Cornell) in 1978. Lacrosse was the bigger sport at Charlottesville
then, but soccer offered the better career opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty obvious that my wait for the head lacrosse job
would be longer,'' Arena says. ``Jim Adams wasn't going to retire
anytime soon and the soccer program was growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena brought it to full flower, making the NCAA tournament 15
straight times, winning four straight titles in the '90s and
posting a better winning percentage (.808) than UCLA basketball
coach John Wooden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought he was a professional coaching college
ball,'' says Agoos, who served as Arena's assistant for a year at
Virginia. ``He always demanded the best from us. He put us in an
environment, especially in practice, where it was competitive,
where we challenged each other every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena could have stayed at Virginia forever. ``I could have been
comfortable there,'' he says. ``But once the pro league began . . .
'' His players knew he would leave. ``He just had to wait for his
time to come,'' says Harkes.
</P>
<P>
   Though MLS was far from a sure thing (``That was an issue.''),
Arena relished the challenge, and coaching D.C. United allowed him
to keep living in Virginia with his wife and teenage son. And
coaching pros, Arena realized over time, was no different than
coaching amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I probably didn't have the confidence to be
as demanding of them as I should have been,'' he concedes. ``But
the expectations of what they need to do have to be there. Maybe I
gave them too much credit because they were professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   Players are players, Arena concluded. In 1996, he coached both
pros and amateurs, directing both D.C. United and the Olympic team.
That combination of credentials is what put Arena at the top of the
domestic candidate list when Sampson resigned at the end of the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Arena didn't figure he'd get the job. ``I thought they
would hire a foreigner,'' he says. But the top foreigners said no
and the landscape changed when federation president Alan
Rothenberg's term expired last August and Dr. S. Robert ``Doctor
Bob'' Contiguglia took over. ``If the decision wasn't left entirely
to Dr. Contiguglia,'' Arena says, ``I wouldn't have been hired.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena had no illusions about what he was inheriting. He knew the
Americans weren't the worst team at the World Cup, but he won't
argue that three-and-out wasn't a huge comedown. ``Not to walk out
of there without a point was disappointing,'' Arena says. ``And
they probably should have had three.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that advancing from a group that included Germany and
Yugoslavia was any gimme. And better teams than the US went
three-and-out, too. ``Spain didn't get out of the first round,''
Arena observes. ``They have the second-toughest pro league behind
Italy, they have incredible talent and organization. But they went
home and we went home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish can't tell you they'll win the Cup in 2010 and
neither can the Americans. ``I don't think that's realistic,'' says
Arena. ``That's typical of the way people who have had authority
with US Soccer think. It's a great marketing concept, but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans struggled to even qualify for the Cup in both 1990
and 1998. They have an international player pool of 50, tops. They
have beaten Brazil once in nearly 70 years (they get another chance
here Wednesday night) and have never won in Mexico. 2010 is a
million years from now. Arena is more concerned with 2000, when
regional qualifying begins for 2002.
</P>
<P>
   He'll learn something useful here this week, he says, but there
was nothing _ as in nada _ to learn from watching the Babes of
Summer. They play in an orange grove. Bruce Arena only deals in
apples.

A SERENE SPOT ON A BUSY BOSTON STREET
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the hustle and bustle of trendy Newbury Street stands a
tranquil and timeless place, the Jewel of Newbury Boutique Hotel &AMP;
Restaurant, filled with both antiques and Old World charm.
</P>
<P>
   The new-yet-old Boston hotel consists of eight rooms/suites on
three floors of a circa 1882 brownstone at 254 Newbury St. As we
learned during a tour, each room has its own distinctive look,
thanks to antiques, artifacts, and crafts from Europe and North
Africa. All baths have been modernized, and most have marble or
brass fittings. And despite the aura of times past, all rooms have
telephones and cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   Two public rooms on the first floor are for lounging and dining.
They are replete with period furnishings, mainly French Empire, and
are complemented by clocks, cut glass, porcelain, gilded mirrors,
antique oils, and Oriental rugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewel of Newbury Restaurant, meanwhile, is on the garden
level and can accommodate up to 44 diners. Those guests find
themselves surrounded by stained glass, tiled pictures,
brass-covered sconces, and fine china and crystal. The constantly
changing cuisine, served at small marble tables, is North
African-inspired and gently flavored with imported spices. Lamb and
couscous are popular, as are an exotic variety of soups, salads,
breads, and desserts. American and European wines are served; so
are regional coffees and teas, including hot mint tea.
</P>
<P>
   Proprietor and owner is the refreshingly candid Mouldi Sayeh,
who spent five years and a lot of money restoring the building and
creating the restaurant and hotel. Both reflect his total
involvement and philosophy that guests are family. Prices range
from $225 for a room with a bath to $2,000 for a four-bedroom
suite. Most restaurant entrees are $15-$28. For more information,
call 617-536-5523, fax 617-424-8798, or visit www.jewelboston.com.

Travel Trivia: France is the world's top tourist destination, with
70 million international arrivals in 1998. But which country came
in second last year? And third? (Answers at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: The JAL Newsletter reports that a hot new fast-food
chain in China is called Baked Pig Face. The specialty is whole
pig's head. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: Baltimore forbids tossing bales of hay from a

   Quotable: ``Grace . . . graceful . . . graciousness'' _
frequently used words in messages accompanying flowers left at the
Kennedy Library in Dorchester in memory of John F. Kennedy Jr. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Helping handful: First, there was an honor: The Connecticut-based
National Theatre of the Deaf was chosen to represent the United
States at the 13th World Congress of the World Federation of the
Deaf in Brisbane, Australia. But then there was a problem: How were
they going to pay for the trip? And now there is a solution: with
travelers' gifts of leftover foreign currency. If you have any
zloty, lira, yen, pesos, drachmas, etc., send your notes and coins
to The National Theatre of the Deaf, 5 West Main St., Chester,
Conn. 06412. A total of $10,000 is needed for the five actors (both
deaf and hearing) and one interpreter. And although the Congress is
July 25-31, any money collected will be used after the trip to pay
the bills for plane tickets and other expenses. (We've sent along
some Irish punts, Spanish pesetas, and Korean won ourselves.) For
more information, call 800-300-5179, 860-526-4971 (both voice) or
860-526-4974 (tty), or e-mail bookNTD(at)aol.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bad idea: Belgium once tried to use cats to deliver mail, but
discovered something all feline owners know: You can't tell a cat
what to do. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Update: The two newest exhibits at Mystic Aquarium in Mystic,
Conn., are up and running . . . or, in one case, swimming. ``The
Alaskan Coast'' is a one-acre outdoor beluga whale exhibit, and the
Institute for Explorations's Challenge of the Deep is a journey
into the world of deep-ocean science and exploration. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rooms galore: Las Vegas, which keeps adding hotels and casinos, now
has more than 113,000 guest rooms. By New Year's Eve, there will be
122,000 rooms. &QL;

Advice to go: Here's one way to keep the kids quiet during your
flight: Tell them that the quietest one gets to land the plane!

Mailbag: Walt Gately of Medfield adds this coda to our recent
discussion of the song ``Route 66'': ``Now it's Interstate 44 and
doesn't rhyme with much of anything.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
It ain't cheap: A pound of Puerto Rico's coffee costs $55 in

CAMPAIGNS WITHOUT LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Elizabeth Drew, analyst and seer extraordinary,
saw it all coming months before George W. Bush did it. What she saw
on the money politics front is interestingly ignored by the latest
presidential candidate-reformer to step forward, former senator
Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In her latest essential volume, ``The Corruption of American
Politics,'' Drew observes correctly that in the age of unlimited
``soft'' money, any notion of limits on financial contributions to
candidates is absurd. And she warns that the next step will be a
final assault on the last fortress of post-Watergate federal
oversight _ limits on spending, overall and in individual states,
during the primary season in exchange for matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Drew reported, again correctly, that more than one candidate was
seriously considering passing up the federal dough in order to be
able to spend as much money as his pals could collect in increments
up to $1,000. Then she accurately analyzed the meaning of such a
step well before President-in-waiting Bush took it: ``That would
complete the cycle of going back to the Watergate days and before _
when there were no limits at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The point here is not that there is anything corrupt or even
questionable about Bush's astonishing pile of money. The point is
that limits are the window that keeps corruption in the broadest
sense out.
</P>
<P>
   Open that window and a lot can come in besides dirty money and
unscrupulous candidacies. For starters, a limitless campaign can
destroy any remaining pretense that the early-voting states (Iowa,
New Hampshire, Arizona, South Carolina) function as equal
opportunities for a barely funded candidacy to break through.
</P>
<P>
   For evidence, one need look no further on the Republican side
than the fight between one fellow spending unlimited zillions of
his own cash (Steve Forbes) and another one (Bush) now able to
shovel zillions of other peoples' at relatively tiny TV markets.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. Who knows if money is the root of it all (Drew
is neutral), but money is all around the myriad of evils that have
turned so many would-be voters away from politics _ virulent
partisanship, poll-driven politicians, negative campaigning,
full-time warfare that crowds out time for old-fashioned
governance, and the decline of legislative cultures that used to
accommodate and soften ideological clashes in the interest of
progress.
</P>
<P>
   What makes her book all you have to read _ as H. L. Mencken's
Carnival of Bunkum begins even earlier this time _ is its
reflective tracing of the gradual unraveling of all that the
quixotic among us thought had been achieved in the wake of
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   It is often forgotten, but the changes worked rather well until
the mid-1980s. That was when a loophole opened by the Federal
Elections Commission, and first noticed by Drew nearly 20 years
ago, was turned into a canyon as huge, unregulated gobs of cash
began to flow into federal campaigns via the political parties.
Today, the only difference between hard and soft money is that the
former is limited in individual amount and the latter is not and is
an avenue for influence to corporations, unions, and rich people.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech here last week _ understandably overshadowed by the
tragedy off Martha's Vineyard _ Bradley joined the reformers' ranks
in his uphill race against Vice President Al Gore. A great deal of
what he had to say was helpful, and Gore made a tactical goof in
starting a sniping match by surrogates over who was sincere or had
a better record on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting a variation on change ideas pushed earlier in the
decade, Bradley urged a 2-1 federal match for gifts up to $250,
public financing of general elections (including for Congress), and
free TV time via the Federal Communications Commission for
participating candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And all this would be in the context of a flat ban on soft
money, the key idea in the reform legislation that is headed for
its annual collision with the stone wall of Congress. To buttress
his point, Bradley went the extra step of offering to forgo soft
money in next year's general election if he is the Democratic
nominee provided the GOP nominee does the same (fat chance).
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley was silent on the spending loophole for ``hard''
money that Bush has now burst through by opting out of the matching
funds system, setting a huge precedent. One reason involves
concerns about the constitutionality of spending limits under
Supreme Court decisions going back to 1976, though another reason
to study Drew's book is its detailed exploration of the actual
content of those decisions, which leave more room for change than
most realize.
</P>
<P>
   Having been bold in his vision of a less corrupting system,
Bradley should have confronted Bush's choice.
</P>
<P>
   The point is not that Bradley's ideas are headed inexorably
toward enactment in time for the next election. Obviously, they are
not. Rather, the point is that this kind of advocacy establishes
fresh values in the national debate, values well within the bounds
of current public opinion. By contrast, Bradley met that test well
recently in advocating a ban on cheap handguns. And it is the
promotion and election of people pushing the right values that
necessarily precedes action.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, I think it is obvious that we are headed toward an
even uglier, more profligate campaign season. As Elizabeth Drew
shows, when the window is wide open, a great deal more than just
money comes pouring in.

BASKETBALL FRIENDS GENEROUS TO BILL BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Forty-five minutes before the event, organizers
still weren't sure if Celtics legend John Havlicek would show up at
a Boston fund-raiser for former Knicks forward Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Havlicek had to reschedule ``a few things,'' travel
in from Hyannis, overcome an allergy to politics, and _ this was
critical _ say something nice about a rival ``whose hand,''
Havlicek later told the crowd, ``is imprinted on my butt.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening last month, full of jock jokes, was a success for
Bradley. The former New York basketball star and three-term
Democratic senator from New Jersey raised more than $225,000 for
his presidential campaign. Havlicek, who retired from the Celtics
in 1978, spoke briefly to about 200 people at the Park Plaza Hotel
and signed autographs into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual I'd be doing this, but then I've never had a
friend who ever ran for president,'' said Havlicek, 59, who owns
three Wendy's restaurants and was, Bradley says, the toughest
opponent he ever had to guard. ``I like Bradley, I always liked
playing against him, and now I'm in his corner.''
</P>
<P>
   So are many other National Basketball Association greats whose
glory days on the court are history but still have the moves to
attract adoring audiences and coax $1,000 checks for Bradley's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This fraternity of Basketball Hall of Famers, former college
players, and a number of sports-franchise owners, coaches, and
general managers, has come together in an informal fund-raising
network that is not only unprecedented in presidential politics but
also giving new meaning to Bradley's nickname during his Knick
years: ``Dollar Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes it even more notable is that for the last two decades
Bradley has honed the image of a cerebral senator and serious
policy wonk and been loath to exploit the myth of the star he was.
Now, as he runs for president, Bradley seems to be both
capitalizing on the political potency of celebrity _ pro wrestler
Jesse Ventura's upset win in the Minnesota governor's race last
year is a classic example _ and accenting the All-American values
he and other squeaky-clean athletes from another era brought to the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign held ``Hoopla,'' its single largest
sports-centered fund-raiser Tuesday (July 27) in Chicago, featuring
Havlicek and another former Celtic, Paul Silas, and players from
the Knicks championship teams of 1970 and 1973 _ Willis Reed,
Cazzie Russell, Earl Monroe, Phil Jackson, and Dave DeBusschere.
The old pros, including Bradley, promise to mingle with the
expected crowd of 1,500. For an extra $500 on top of the $100 and
$250 ticket prices, they will shoot a few hoops with
contributor-fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of young sports fans, being with these Hall of
Famers is like going to Mount Olympus,'' said Rick Wright, who
played on the Princeton team with Bradley, a three-time collegiate
All-American, and now is national finance director of Bradley's
presidential campaign. ``And having legends like Havlicek around is
very positive for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bradley said it is ``particularly gratifying''
but not so surprising that men who intensely and intimately shared
an important time with him are on his new team. ``Playing with or
against each other creates bonds that last a lifetime,'' said
Bradley, who thinks of his Knicks teammates ``like family.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the veterans ``capture something bigger than
basketball'' in the memories and imagination of older fans. Not so
the younger ones. ``They come up and ask me why we wore such short
shorts,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   David Cohen, a 35-year-old Washington lawyer, says that for
younger voters who are cynical about politics, Bradley's link to
the world of pro basketball gives him credibility and stature other
candidates don't have. ``If Phil Jackson says he's great,'' Cohen
said as he waited to hear Bradley speak last week, ``that's good
enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said he can't estimate how much of the $11.7 million
collected by the campaign so far comes from the basketball network,
but 15 to 20 of Bradley's largest fund-raisers have been headlined
by sports figures, he said. Events with Jackson, a close Bradley
friend who guided the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships and is
the new coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, reaped more than $1
million each in Chicago, San Francisco, and Brunswick, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Such financial backing is helping Bradley stay competitive as he
takes on Vice President Al Gore, the front-runner for the
Democratic nomination. Bradley's July 15 filing with the Federal
Election Commission showed his campaign had $7.5 million cash on
hand, close to Gore's $9.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Lucchino, another Princeton player who is now president of
the San Diego Padres baseball team, got owner John Moores Jr., to
agree to raise $1 million for Bradley. Washington Wizards owner Abe
Pollin, who calls Gore ``a close friend,'' hosted a fund-raising
lunch for Bradley at his country estate. Jerry Colangelo, president
of the Phoenix Suns, held a fund-raiser last month for Bradley,
even though he is supporting a fellow Arizonan, Republican Senator
John McCain, for president.
</P>
<P>
   And in what could be Bradley's biggest sports coup, Michael
Jordan gave the campaign the maximum $1,000, an amount matched by
his wife, Juanita. Jordan said on ``Larry King Live'' he respected
Bradley's leadership so much that ``I do see myself supporting
him.'' Asked if Jordan would campaign for him, Bradley said, ``I
don't think that will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the Knicks' No. 24 is managing without the
Bulls' No. 23 to make his core support group, investment bankers,
lawyers, and Wall Street brokers, wax nostalgic about New York's
golden days and open their wallets. At a recent fund-raiser at a
Manhattan athletic club, the 55-year-old Bradley delighted donors
by picking up a basketball and sinking two free throws with his
eyes shut, Wright said.

   TAKE-BOS  
 WASHINGTON: ... Wright said.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's not just that Bill Bradley was a terrific basketball
player,'' said author David Halberstam, whose most recent sports
book is about Jordan. ``It's that he was the prototype of the
scholar-athlete, a young, middle-class man in the Ivy League who
did his homework and willed himself to be the best. He captured the
imagination of a particular class of guys who could relate to him
and who would have liked to do the kinds of things he did and would
have liked to play ball the way he played.''
</P>
<P>
   The mythology of the 6-foot-5-inch Bradley, arguably the best
player in Ivy League history, the captain of the 1964 US Olympic
gold-medal basketball team, and a member of the Basketball Hall of
Fame, looms large indeed in his official campaign biography.
</P>
<P>
   It tells how relentlessly Bradley practiced (As a boy growing up
in Crystal City, Mo., he would take 25 shots in a row from
different spots around the basket. If he missed one, he would start
over). It records how he was offered athletic scholarships from 75
colleges, chose Duke, but switched at the last minute to Princeton
(which gave him no money) because it had a better record of
producing Rhodes scholars. It recalls how he would score a
record-shattering 45 points on a Saturday night for the Tigers, go
straight from the game to the library, and study until it was time
to teach his regular Sunday school class.
</P>
<P>
   After college, Bradley was drafted by the Knicks but opted to
spend a year at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar first. He wasn't the
biggest, strongest, or quickest player when he joined the team in
1967, but he played hard and smart and blended with a squad fabled
for its talent and teamwork. As a pro, Bradley refused to endorse
products, and he became known as Dollar Bill because he was so
frugal that he wore threadbare sportscoats and drove an old
Volkswagen bug.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was tenacious but never pretentious, and he took a lot
of ribbing for it, said veteran ABC-TV sportscaster Dick Schaap.
Bradley once told DeBusschere, his roommate on the road, that he
didn't want a car radio because it was too disconcerting while he
drove. ``Dave didn't have the heart to tell Bill you could turn it
off,'' Schaap said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lapchick, director of Northeastern University's Center
for the Study of Sport in Society, said part of the mystique of
Bradley and the veterans backing him is they stood for
old-fashioned values of hard work, selflessness, and discipline
that are increasingly hard to identify in many of today's highly
paid and sometimes badly behaved professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a transitional stage where people are losing faith in
sports figures,'' said Lapchick, whose father, Joe, was a New York
Celtics Hall of Famer and later a Knicks coach. ``Players like Bill
Bradley came from a different generation. He made his reputation
when sports were clean and uncriticized, and athletes had positive
baggage to carry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's fame was certainly a factor in his first Senate race,
which he won in 1978, just a year after retiring from the Knicks.
Other sports figures have succeeded in national politics, but
Bradley is the first professional athlete to make a serious bid for
the White House, and the sports myth may serve as more than a money
magnet for the campaign. Doug McAuliffe, media strategist for
Kentucky Senator Jim Bunning, a baseball Hall of Famer, said
Bradley doesn't have to overcome the image of a ``dumb jock.'' He
predicted the candidate's athletic legend will be an important link
to traditional Democratic voters, particularly men, and make it
hard for Gore to demonize him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has a national name because of where he has been. Bill
Bradley has a national name for what he has done and how he has
performed in basketball and the Senate,'' said Donald Dell, a
Bradley fund-raiser and chairman of ProServ Inc., a sports
marketing company. ``The qualities that made Bradley a great player
_ the self-confidence, the mental toughness, the intense
competitiveness _ will emerge in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, a nonprofit group that studies campaign finances, said
Bradley's campaign is unique because ``it definitely seems to have
access to a network of donors that other candidates don't have''
and is built more on friendships than favor-seeking. ``If you are
going to have a network of fund-raisers, I would prefer it to be
sports stars rather than Washington lobbyists,'' Makinson said.
``It seems more innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Willis Reed, the powerful center on the Knicks two championship
teams of the 1970s, said he normally doesn't get involved in
politics, but these days he goes where the Bradley campaign needs
him, simply out of respect and affection for his former teammate.
``Bradley understood what he could do, and he always went out and
did it well,'' said Reed, who calls Bradley ``a special person and
a close friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who is now a senior vice president of the NBA's New Jersey
Nets, said he doesn't want or expect anything in return for his
help. ``All I want to be is a friend of the president,'' said Reed,
adding, however, he was sure ``my wife would make me go to his
inauguration.''

   MILWAUKEE _ Marcus Hawkins armed himself with a .44 caliber
handgun and went looking for money and trouble.
</P>
<P>
   First he broke into a north side apartment and abducted a woman
and her 17-month-old son. He raped the woman, then drove off with
the boy. But he soon ran out of gas, so he abandoned the crying
toddler and tried to rob a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   A clerk finally stopped Hawkins by shooting him in the leg.
Hawkins is now serving a 124-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins's 1996 case would be just an ugly criminal footnote if
not for one key detail: The way Hawkins obtained his gun fits an
emerging pattern that challenges conventional wisdom about the
source of guns used in crimes. And that, in turn, has raised hopes
among criminal justice specialists that cracking down on criminal
gun play is a realistic goal.
</P>
<P>
   The .44 caliber handgun Hawkins used wasn't stolen; it was sold
to Hawkins by a small-time trafficker named Lawrence Shikes, who
had bought it legally from a neighborhood gun store.
</P>
<P>
   And not just any gun store. It was Badger Guns and Ammo Inc, a
squat, fortress-like building on the edge of a West Milwaukee that
is, several studies reveal, the nation's leading source of guns
traced to crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, 495 crime guns were traced to Badger, or an
average of more than one per day. The next highest was 349 from an
Ohio gun store, according to data compiled by the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The ATF data did not name the
stores, but law enforcement authorities, researchers and others
familiar with the data confirmed Badger was No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But Badger was hardly alone. Rather, it was tops among a
relatively small number of federally licensed firearms dealers that
are the source of a disproportionate number of guns traced to
crimes, according to several yet-to-be released studies.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, just 1 percent of the nation's federally licensed
firearms dealers were responsible for 45 percent of the guns traced
to crimes last year, according to an analysis of ATF data performed
by the staff of Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   A separate study by Northeastern University researcher Glenn
Pierce, working under contract to ATF, found that half the guns
used in crimes in 1996 and 1997 came from just 389 federally
licensed firearms dealers, or less than one-half of 1 percent of
the 104,855 dealers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the studies also found that almost half of all
crime guns were used for an illegal act within 50 miles, and within
three years, of their original sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to think crime guns were all stolen. They're not. We
used to think there was basically no firearms trafficking. In fact
there's a lot of firearms trafficking. We used to think that to the
extent there was firearms trafficking it was all interstate gun
running. In fact, most of it seems to be local and close to home,''
said David Kennedy, a senior researcher at Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government who directs the Boston Gun Project.
</P>
<P>
   This shifting view of the sources of weapons used in crimes is
also forcing reconsideration of the strategies now used to
interrupt the illicit trade that provides firearms to criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to think there was such an ocean of guns out there
that there wasn't anything powerful that could be done to try to
limit criminal access,'' Kennedy said. ``In fact, the traced
studies and a number of other sources of information have been
showing that there are major gun sources and big traffickers, and
you can find them and shut them down.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether the biggest problem is rogue dealers
or middlemen who act as traffickers. Regardless, the studies'
conclusions are prompting new thinking on firearms regulations
regarding gun dealers and ``straw purchasers,'' legal buyers who
sell weapons to people barred from owning guns. It also is
prompting an increasing number of cities, including Badger's home
city of Milwaukee, to follow an example set by Boston and trace all
firearms that police come across, regardless of whether the guns
were used in a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer recently introduced legislation to push the issue a step
further. His bill would would allow ATF agents unlimited visits to
any gun store with more than 25 guns traced to crimes in the
previous year. Currently, ATF agents not investigating specific
criminal activity can make just one such visit per year without a
warrant. The change proposed by Schumer would have affected 399 gun
dealers nationwide last year, said Jim Kessler, Schumer's policy
director.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's bill also would give ATF authority to suspend the
licenses of gun dealers. ``Now they can pretty much only revoke a
license, which they rarely do,'' said Kessler. ``With suspensions,
they could take quick action against a rogue dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would specifically outlaw straw purchases of guns,
in part by requiring that any private resale of a firearm within
six months of its original purchase be preceded by a background
check of the new buyer. The law, which would allow prosecutors to
go after anyone who made such a sale without the background checks,
is much less cumbersome than current law. As it now stands,
prosecutors must prove a gun buyer intended to resell the gun
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The gun lobby has firmly opposed Schumer's bill, arguing that
existing laws are sufficient to punish straw purchasers, gun
traffickers, and lax gun dealers. Proponents of gun owners' rights
said the problem is that federal prosecutions of gun crimes have
dropped sharply in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they started prosecuting those cases fully and
unflinchingly, the word would get out in the criminal community
that providing a firearm to a prohibited person isn't worth the
trouble,'' said Bill Powers, director of public affairs for the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   A clearer sense of how the system works, and the difficulty of
intercepting illegal sales, begins to emerge from a visit to
Badger, which proudly bills itself as Wisconsin's largest handgun
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Located next to an auto salvage business and across the street
from a huge grain elevator, the store still looks appropriate for
its previous use as an aluminum can-recycling center. The only
outward signs that something has changed are the barred windows and
the huge concrete blocks designed to stop thieves from driving a
truck through a wall to get at the guns.
</P>
<P>
   Inside is a huge assortment of weaponry, ammunition, and
paraphernalia, from cleaning fluids to holsters to knives and
pepper spray. High on the walls are long guns, mostly hunting
rifles and military-style weapons, alongside several stuffed animal
heads and an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   A sign near the door warns, ``No loaded guns in this store!''
But on another wall is a wooden plaque, carved with a large
revolver and the words: ``We don't dial 911.''
</P>
<P>
   Handguns are kept in glass cases at the front counter, with
prices as low as $149.99 for a .22 caliber handgun. Until recently,
the store sold several models of $99.99 handguns, but pulled them
from the shelves in the wake of criticism from antigun activists.
Still, a dozen different handguns have price tags of under $200,
though others cost upwards of $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old store is owned by brothers Mick and Curt
Beatovic, 53 and 44 years old respectively, and their childhood
friend Wally Allan, 45, all lifelong gun enthusiasts who Allen says
consider themselves ``The three banditos.'' Mick Beatovic
interrupts him to ask of a reporter: ``Make that the three amigos,
OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Since opening for business they have sold more than 40,000 guns,
according to records they provided.
</P>
<P>
   To hear the owners tell it, they are deeply disturbed by, but
ultimately not responsible for, their No. 1 ranking on traced crime
guns. They blamed it on several factors, including their location
as the closest gun shop to Milwaukee's central city; a relative
absence of competition; and ``easy access'' from the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Mick Beatovic said they also are being unfairly singled out
because they keep such good records and cooperate so fully with
authorities that it makes it easier to trace guns to the store.
</P>
<P>
   Allan said there are other factors, as well. He pointed to four
young black men looking at handguns. ``The whole shop is full of
black people. What happens when these guys and these guns leave the
store we can't control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mick Beatovic said the store does all it can to prevent straw
purchasers, turning away three to five potential buyers a day.
While a reporter was in the store, he turned away Lavonda Taylor
and her 18-year-old son, Lee Andrew Jones, when an employee
suspected the gun was for Jones. She complained that she was
seeking a gun for protection, but acknowledged her son knew much
more about firearms than she did.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mick Beatovic said, he suspects one or two straw buyers
``slip through'' every day.
</P>
<P>
   Local ATF agents confirmed that they have a good relationship
with Badger's owners and do not believe they purposely sell guns to
criminals. ``They are as responsible as they can possibly be in the
business they are in,'' said Mark Murray, the agent in charge of
the ATF office in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Murray agreed with NRA officials and Badger's owners that a
major problem is too few prosecutions of straw buyers. ``They're
putting firearms in the community and causing death and destruction
the same way a dope dealer is, and in many cases they're not being
looked at that way,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   But Milwaukee's mayor, John O. Norquist, said it is wrong to
absolve Badger's owners of responsibility. The city's murder rate
is up this year, with 69 so far this year, versus 53 at the same
point in 1998. Most involved firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they sell to criminals, it's creating a greater likelihood
of murder, robbery, rape, and they shouldn't be able to do that
with impunity.'' Norquist said. He said he is powerless to act,
however, because the Wisconsin Legislature has barred local
communities from regulating gun shops.
</P>
<P>
   Badger's owners said they are troubled by stories about guns
sold by their store being used by criminals such as Hawkins. But
they make no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I think about that, but I also think of the times I sold
guns to people and they used them to protect their families,'' Mick
Beatovic said. ``I can't tell what's in people's hearts, but I know
for a fact that a gun will be used more times for good than it will
be to hurt someone. The way I see it, an honest person ought to be
able to have a gun.''

ARMY TESTING A SAFER AMMUNITION FOR ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Human armies have been mowing each other down with lead bullets
for 600 years _ and the mayhem goes beyond the dead and maimed.
</P>
<P>
   After all, lead is harmful to the environment. It contaminates
soil and water. It makes birds and fish sick.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the US Army with a planet-friendly projectile for the
next millennium _ the ``green bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ammunition, just starting to go into experimental
production, rips flesh and bone as efficiently as old-fashioned
rounds. But the slugs are made of a tungsten alloy, not lead, and
pose little ecological hazard.
</P>
<P>
   There's irony here, lots, as munitions scientists redefine the
notion of a ``clean kill.'' But experts say creating a bullet that
is both harmless and deadly represents a vital military mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lead pollution is just a major, major problem on the firing
range,'' said Charles Cutshaw, small arms specialist and editor of
Jane's Ammunition Handbook. ``Lead dust is as bad for humans as it
is for wildlife. So coming up with `nontoxic' ammunition is an
urgent matter, odd as it may sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon already faces a $9 billion cleanup bill for
training sites dangerously polluted by lead. So the $12 million
committed to the green ammo project is a small price _ and success
appears at hand.
</P>
<P>
   According to Myra Hess, spokeswoman for the Army's Armament
Research, Development and Engineering Center at the Picatinny
Arsenal in New Jersey, the new projectile is ``an environmentally
friendly and safer bullet with the same performance, more accuracy,
and same lethality as its lead counterpart.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the slugs should still wreak bloody havoc on the
battlefield. But when the fighting stops, the killing grounds will
be safe for birds, bunnies, and butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   But making war less dirty is just part of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Most military bullets are fired in training, not combat. The US
Army pops off 300 million to 400 million rounds a year; ``live
fire'' practice keeps troops ready for combat.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, inspectors from the Environmental
Protection Agency pack at least as much punch on the home front as
the Pentagon's brass. Under fire from regulators, the military has
been forced to shut down hundreds of firing ranges at bases across
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, for example, the EPA halted all live fire
training at the Massachusetts Military Reservation amid warnings
that lead from rifle and artillery ranges was leaching into Cape
Cod's water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that Army commanders are putting a new twist
on an age-old marching order: ``Get the lead out!''
</P>
<P>
   Get the xylene, barium nitrate, methyl chloroform, and other
earth-harming substances out, too. A single military small arms
cartridge contains 16 toxins in the bullet, primer, and gunpowder
propellant, according to military scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to have a completely lead-free cartridge,
including primer, by 2003 that will out-perform the standard
round,'' Wade Bunting, technical executive for the green ammo
project, told the Picatinny Arsenal newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Said Arthur Pizza, senior project engineer: ``We're making
history. Soldiers have been using lead bullets since the 1400s _
this is a significant change.''
</P>
<P>
   The changeover echoes a trend in shooting sports. Waterfowl
hunters have already converted from lead shotgun pellets to
ammunition made of steel, bismuth, or tungsten polymer, according
to Lawrence Ference, director of research for the Connecticut-based
National Shooting Sports Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   That followed the discovery that the billions of lead pellets _
fired by generations of hunters _ embedded in the mud of wintering
grounds from the Gulf of Mexico to New England were poisoning ducks
and geese. Swallowed lead is absorbed by animal tissue, and can
gradually build to lethal levels.
</P>
<P>
   On the military front, the first million green bullets are
already rattling off production lines after shooting tests at an
unsullied tundra test range 100 miles from Nome, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year or two, production should shoot to 200 million
bullets a year, and eventually the cleaner 5.56 mm rounds _ a
tungsten-tin core under a thin coating of copper _ will be the only
ammunition issued for the M-16 rifle, at least for training.
</P>
<P>
   The M-16 is the basic infantry weapon for US soldiers and is
standard issue for the ground forces of about 30 other countries,
including Canada, Israel, and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Other Western nations are expected to follow the United States
in converting their weapons to green ammo. Some, including Germany,
are already developing their own non-polluting rounds.
</P>
<P>
   For tungsten producers, the switch to the dense, white metal
represents a potential bonanza. If all goes as planned, demand from
the US military alone could give a 10 percent boost to worldwide
tungsten sales and production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that results in increased use of tungsten is
obviously going to be rather heartening for us,'' says Michael
Maby, general secretary of the London-based International Tungsten
Industry Association. ``It's good news.''
</P>
<P>
   It also may prove a last laugh for the hard-pressed industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the US military abandoned plans to use tungsten to
create a new generation of armor-piercing shells, mainly because
the metal was too expensive. Instead, weapons makers turned to
``depleted uranium,'' dealing a serious blow to tungsten producers.
</P>
<P>
   But uranium shells turn out to be hazardous not just to the
enemy but to the earth. According to environmental groups, the
shells released contaminants into air and soil during the Persian
Gulf War and, most recently, in the air campaign against Serbia,
where depleted-uranium shells were fired by A-10 Warthog jets and
other NATO aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of tungsten say the metal makes for a projectile that
does a dandy job of killing people but causes no ecological harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swans or geese that ingest lead shot often sicken and die,''
said Maby. ``But if they swallow tungsten, it just goes in one end
and out the other.''

FUROR FOLLOWS PRINCETON PHILOSOPHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter Singer walks slowly down the supermarket aisle
passing boxes of diapers and tidily wrapped packages of meat.
</P>
<P>
   This philosopher and Princeton University professor earns his
daily bread contemplating questions of life and death _ and some of
his answers have caused a furor. Pausing beneath a shelf of Pampers
and beside a stack of Tobin's First Prize bacon, he expounds, a bit
reluctantly at first, on the differences between newborn babies and
pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess that the pig is more self-aware,'' Singer says,
measuring his words with care, ``particularly if the infant has a
brain disease and has no capacity to see itself as self-aware.''
</P>
<P>
   So which has more of a right to life: the infant or the pig?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'd have to say,'' Singer says, ``that the pig has
the greater claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark statements such as these have made this lanky Australian
one of the most controversial voices in academia. Now anger over
his appointment to a prestigious chair in bioethics at Princeton's
Center for Human Values is bubbling up into the national political
arena.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the Republican presidential candidate and a member
of the Princeton board of trustees, has urged that Princeton
rescind Singer's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Singer appointment,'' Forbes wrote in May to Princeton
president Harold Shapiro, ``sends a dangerous and debilitating
message that anything goes, that there are no bounds when it comes
to questions of life and death.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer's utilitarian views, Forbes continued, ``fit right in
with the thinking that the Nazis used to justify their euthanasia
programs on the physically and mentally handicapped before the
Second World War . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, elaborated with a
reference to the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado.
``With students as sensitive to issues _ and Columbine is a perfect
example _ we shouldn't be promoting the culture of death in any
form,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic testing, embryo experimentation, and other laboratory
advances have brought Singer's concerns to the forefront of public
opinion. His Princeton appointment last year touched off a storm of
protest from those who advocate for the disabled or against
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Some called him ``Professor Death'' and ``Baby Killer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Singer, who lost three grandparents in the Nazi Holocaust,
the Forbes letter is especially infuriating. ``It's a glib,
superficial use of the Nazi analogy,'' said Singer, a married
father of three adult daughters. ``I just don't think he can have
read the stuff I've written.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer gave a series of roaming interviews recently, holding
forth in his New York City rental apartment, a restaurant and the
local Grand Union supermarket, where he came to discuss the
cruelies inherent in factory farming.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes wrote to Princeton after prodding by conservatives.
Neither university officials nor a Forbes spokesman would say if he
originally voted to approve the appointment. Forbes is just one of
several prominent politicians on the board of trustees, including
Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley, Tennessee Senator
Bill Frist and former secretary of state James Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Harmon, a Princeton spokesman, said he could not believe
Forbes would demand that the university president rescind a faculty
member's appointment to a tenured chair on ideological grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one who understands their role as a trustee would ask to
rescind the appointment of someone who is academically qualified,''
Harmon said, adding that what was at stake was nothing less than
academic freedom. Princeton, he said, would not buckle to pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Singer's defenders say the tumult has obscured the work of a man
who has written widely on a host of thorny social questions,
including medical ethics, overseas aid, civil disobedience,
treatment of refugees and the status of animals.
</P>
<P>
   Singer's academic and activist credentials are impressive.
Holding an Oxford degree, the former professor at Monash University
in Melbourne, founded the International Association of Bioethics.
</P>
<P>
   His 1975 book, ``Animal Liberation,'' which compared treatment
of animals with slavery, launched the animal rights movement; it
has sold 400,000 copies in nine languages and has turned tens of
thousands of people into vegetarians while inspiring international
reforms in the treatment of lab animals and livestock. He is the
president of the Great Ape Project, which is dedicated to the
protection of chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. As a
philosopher, he appears to practice what he preaches: he is a
committed vegetarian; he gives one fifth of his income away to
international relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the rare people who have had an impact,'' says
Arthur Caplan, the director of the center for Bioethics at the
University of Pennsylvania, who says he disagrees with much of what
Singer has written but still calls him a friend. ``This makes him
frightening to people who have political agendas. Normally no one
cares what eggheads say in ivory towers or in academic journals
with circulations under three digits.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer's philosophy flows from the utilitarian ethic of 19th
century British philosopher Jeremy Bentham. Utilitarians focus on
the consequences of acts rather than underlying motives. At the
root of Singer's world view is an abhorrence of cruelty and
suffering and a belief that the interests of all sentient beings
ought to be given similar consideration.
</P>
<P>
   It is from this perspective that he advocates giving parents and
doctors _ not the state _ the right to kill newborns with severe
defects that will condemn them to lives of pain with limited mental
development. An infant, Singer says, is a being that is neither
rational nor self-conscious; unlike adults or even some adult
animals, it's incapable of seeing itself as a distinct entity
existing over time.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1981 book ``The Expanding Circle,'' Singer argues that
starvation in Africa should be considered as horrifying as hunger
in America; animal suffering should be deemed as scandalous as the
suffering of a child.
</P>
<P>
   He argues for considering euthanasia for the elderly or accident
victims who are not ``self-conscious, rational or autonomous,'' as
long as while they were rational they did not expressly say they
opposed being put to death under these circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Singer and his admirers argue, with some justification, that his
views on the relative rights of animals and children have been
twisted and misunderstood. For instance, it is not true that Singer
ever stated that snails have more of a right to life than newborn
infants. What he did say, though, was that neither snails nor
newborns have self-awareness. ``It's a factual claim, not an
ethical one,'' said Singer.
</P>
<P>
   But even in their context his views are radical and disturbing.
Because they are autonomous and self-conscious creatures, he
believes certain adult animals _ chimpanzees, dogs, pigs and cats _
have a greater right to life than children. He would allow parents,
in consultation with their doctors, to kill babies with such
defects as spinal bifida or Down syndrome, he writes in his book
``Practical Ethics.'' In rare cases, he can see an argument for
killing babies with hemophilia, even though they may have the
prospect of relatively normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total (utilitarian) view makes it necessary to ask whether
the death of the haemophiliac infant would lead to the creation of
another being who would not otherwise have existed,'' Singer
writes. ``In other words, if the haemophiliac child is killed, will
his parents have another child whom they would not have if the
haemophiliac child lives? If they would, is the second child likely
to have a better life than the one killed? Often it will be
possible to answer both these questions affirmatively.''
</P>
<P>
   These views, Singer admits, are radical, but they're also highly
qualified and nuanced and they're not his final word on the
subject, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more a matter of pursuing a philosophical point.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer makes it clear that he is not advocating killing
handicapped people who are old enough to express a preference to go
on living.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these qualifications, disabled people still find his
views threatening. Killing disabled infants, they say, is just a
hop-skip-and-jump down the ethical path to killing disabled adults.
</P>
<P>
   Singer, who sees no moral distinction between killing a newborn
infant and a fetus (he argues neither is a self-conscious being),
doesn't understand the fuss. Millions of women, he notes, terminate
their pregnancies after tests turn up genetic abnormalities. ``All
of these women and all of the people who endorse that practice are
making the exact same judgment that I am,'' Singer says. ``They're
saying it's better to not have a child with spinal bifida than
with; they're saying it's better not to have a child with Down
syndrome than with.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer does appear to be retreating from some of his earlier
views. In the book he co-authored with Helga Kuhse, ``Should The
Baby Live?'' Singer argues that parents and doctors should have 28
days to perform diagnostic tests on their newborn infant before
deciding whether it should be killed or live. Today, he's not so
sure. ``Now I think that's arbitrary,'' he says. ``It's better to
work on a case by case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Singer's friends have advised him to cloak his words
more in euphemism. ``Some things are easier to swallow buffered or
coded,'' says Caplan.
</P>
<P>
   But Singer isn't about to change. ``It's better to be a little
blunt and to get people to think about what they're doing,'' he
says. ``At least then we get to have a clear head-to-head debate.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The government in his home country wanted Charles Baadom dead
simply because of his ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Baadom's ethnic tribal group has been persecuted for years by
its government. Its land has been polluted, its leader hanged.
</P>
<P>
   So Baadom fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pack, I just ran,'' said Baadom, 27, who arrived in
Boston on June 10 with his wife, Blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Like nearly 75,000 others who arrived in the United States in
the last year, the Baadoms are refugees _ immigrants that the US
government has determined are fleeing persecution and cannot return
home safely.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the recent crisis in Kosovo and the stories of the
horrors committed there, the word ``refugee'' has evoked among many
Americans images of ethnic Albanians running from burning homes and
mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   But Baadom, an Ogoni tribesman from Nigeria, is not a Kosovar,
and neither are the overwhelming majority of refugees arriving in
the United States this year, most of whom are struggling to build
new lives with little government or private assistance.
</P>
<P>
   For these refugees, the Kosovo crisis, and the intense media
scrutiny that prompted the flood of donations to relief groups,
represents an unexpected windfall, paying for such necessities as
food, blankets, basic furniture, rental assistance and other
essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, for some refugees and their sponsors, the intense
focus on the Kosovars and the millions of dollars that have poured
into relief agencies helping them raise a fundamental question:
What pulls at America's heartstrings?
</P>
<P>
   One answer, refugee workers say, is a narrow view of the world
based on a lack of understanding of other cultures, especially
people coming from impoverished, developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the daily televised images of tired, frightened
Kosovars fleeing the onslaught of Serb forces was a heartbreaking
sight and made it clear that the world had to respond.
</P>
<P>
   But while there may be no parallel deluge of televised images,
terrified, weary refugees like Baadom have been streaming out of
several African and other nations for several years.
</P>
<P>
   At the International Institute of Boston, which has been
resettling refugees for 75 years, many of the former refugees who
work for the agency say they are happy for the Kosovars, but
perplexed by the intense attention they have received.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all scratching their heads bewildered,'' said Westy
Egmont, executive director of the International Institute. ``I
don't think there is an easy explanation for why we've become
riveted to one population and not to all.''
</P>
<P>
   Some refugee aid workers suggest it may be easier for white
Americans of European ancestry to identify with the white, European
Kosovars than with refugees from places such as rural Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for many middle-class Americans to relate to the
Kosovars who were forced out of their apartments and were dressed
well, had their televisions, and their computers,'' said Ralston H.
Deffenbaugh Jr., national president of Lutheran Immigration and
Refugee Services, one of the nine national agencies that resettles
refugees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The massive coverage of the war in Kosovo and the poignant
pictures of Kosovars arriving in refugee camps exposed Americans to
a stark and simple picture of the confict, refugee advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for the American public to see who the good guys are
and who the bad guys are,'' said Rita Kantarowski, director of the
International Rescue Committee in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Many conflicts in places such as Africa have not received nearly
the same attention, in part because they have not been as easy for
Americans to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rare American who knows where Somalia is and who can
identify with the more rural developing nations,'' Egmont said.
``You have the unknown, race, and educational levels all working to
act as obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains, however, aid workers say, that refugees are
more similar than not.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing they all have in common is they've lost their place
in the world,'' said Claire Carroll, the director of refugee and
immigration services for Catholic Charities of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   According to many national and local directors of resettlement
agencies, refugees from Kosovo are receiving the most attention by
Americans since the boat people of southeast Asia, who started
arriving here in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, nearly 164,000 Southeast Asian refugees _ mostly
Vietnamese _ arrived in America. The number of Vietnamese refugees
to the United States remained above 10,000 through 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, about 10,500 Kosovars have arrived in the United
States; nearly 400 have settled in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of help for the Kosovars has been overwhelming,
aid agencies say.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Catholic Charities, the International Institute of
Boston, and the International Rescue Committee have been flooded
with money, furniture, and offers of housing for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, Catholic Charities of Boston has raised nearly
$200,000 in aid just for Kosovo refugees. It was the first time the
agency established a fund specifically for one refugee group.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the huge public response to the plight of the
Kosovars has generated unexpected windfalls for other refugees,
according to aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   For his first three weeks in the United States, Baadom and his
pregnant wife were able to share a Cambridge apartment with a
Kosovar refugee.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have called local agencies wanting to help the
Kosovars, but after being told there was enough aid flowing to
those refugees, donors have ended up giving money, housing, and
furniture to aid other newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say, `And by the way there are other refugees' and they
say, `Oh, OK, we want to help all refugees,' '' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   The extra largesse is indirectly helping refugees like Baadom,
who is unemployed and living in a rental apartment that Catholic
Charities helps pay for.
</P>
<P>
   Many agencies are trying to use the current fixation on the
Kosovars to educate the public about challenges all refugees face.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've lost their homes, their profession, and, for a large
part, their identities,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long-term story,'' Egmont added. ``It's not a flash in
the pan.''

 UNDATED: ... or doctors.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most controversial aspects of circumcision is that it
is often performed without the use of an analgesic to lessen the
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only procedure done that involves a scalpel
cutting skin that is done routinely without analgesia,'' said Dr.
Lisa Stellwagen, a pediatrician at Massachusetts General Hospital
who said she always uses pain relief. ``For decades, nurses have
had to hold down these screaming babies, and it's a horrible
experience . . . There's really no excuse for not numbing up the
baby anymore. The technology has been around for 20 years and is
exceedingly safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some obstetricians argued that there is also pain
associated with giving a needle, most agreed that pain relief
should be a no-brainer. ``I was personally embarrassed,'' said
Acker, who began using analgesia after watching a demonstration
last year by Stellwagen. ``The difference is night and day.''
</P>
<P>
   Brigham and Women's Hospital now says that nine out of 10
circumcisions are performed with analgesia. But other hospitals are
slower to change. Last year at Newton-Wellesley Hospital, the
majority of circumcisions were performed without analgesia. Today,
that number has dropped to half, said Dr. Thomas Beatty, chief of
obstetrics and gynocology.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stellwagen has performed about 3,000 circumcisions, all
using analgesia, she is against the practice. ``I think it's not
necessary,'' she said. ``It's cosmetic. If parents ask me if I
think it's necessary, I often try to talk them out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One recent day, Stellwagen scheduled a circumcision for an
11-day-old boy. The father smiles broadly and tells her he wants
his son to look like him, a common reason for circumcision. ``It's
that Dad thing, that locker room thing,'' Stellwagen says after the
parents have left the room. The parents are not invited to the
procedure but can attend if they insist. Most don't.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse Alexa Laurent places the baby on a plastic device called a
Circumstraint. He begins to cry when his legs are strapped down.
Laurent gives the baby a sugar-coated pacifier to calm him and
holds his arms. ``Babies don't like to be restrained,'' Stellwagen
says.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing gloves, Stellwagen gives the baby a series of four
injections around the base of the penis. The baby cries again and
there is a little blood. Stellwagen waits five minutes and begins
separating the foreskin. The whole procedure takes four minutes
during which the baby cries, but there is no blood-curdling scream.
``He feels a little of that,'' Stellwagen says. A little blood is
wiped away, the baby is hugged, wrapped, and returned to the
parents.
</P>
<P>
   At Massachusetts General, a group of doctors and nurses on break
who were polled about circumcision are overwhelmingly opposed to
it. The nurses charge that some doctors do not take the time to
discuss circumcision with parents. ``For the great majority of
Americans, circumcision is taken for granted,'' said Dr. Marvin
Wang, a pediatrician at the hospital. ``I don't know what this bond
is that parents feel the need for the son to look like his
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Others think circumcision rates would tumble if parents had to
pay for the procedure. ``It'll change when the insurance companies
don't cover it anymore,'' said one nurse. In Britain that is
exactly what happened. Once insurance stopped covering routine
circumcisions in 1948, rates fell to below 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Complication rates of circumcision are rare, but some procedures
have to be redone. ``I've heard circumcision redo rates as high as
10 pecent. Parents aren't aware of that,'' Stellwagen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly disagree with the procedure. I think it's totally
unnecessary,'' said Jane Burleson, a registered nurse at Mass.
General. ``It's a big decision to make for someone who has no say
in the matter. Would you make a choice to have it medically done
unless there was a real compelling medical reason to do it? Why is
it OK to do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, some nurses have come together against circumcision.
``Why would you cut a healthy functional body part from somebody
when you haven't got their consent? It's genital mutilation,'' said
Mary Conat, a registered nurse and cofounder of Nurses for the
Rights of the Child, a Santa Fe advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights organizations do not see it as an issue.
``Amnesty International doesn't consider ordinary circumcision a
human rights issue,'' said Joshua Rubenstein, northeast regional
director of Amnesty International USA. ``There's no comparison to
female genital mutilation. It's not castration. Should I be
arrested for torture because I had a bris in my living room under
Jewish law using a topical anesthesia?''
</P>
<P>
   Jews and Muslims believe in circumcision, although Muslims
circumcise later in childhood. Jews believe it is part of the
sacred pact between Abraham and God to be performed by a specially
trained ``mohel'' on the eighth day after birth. Usually the mohel
uses a local analgesia cream or a wine-soaked cloth for the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Earliest records show that circumcision began in Egypt about
4,500 years ago. It became popular in the United States in the late
19th century when doctors thought it would discourage masturbation.
After World War II the procedure was sometimes automatically done
without a consent form after birth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in addition to what some call the barbarism of the practice
and its dubious medical benefit, many are questioning circumcision
on the grounds that it can make sex less enjoyable for the male.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a country of males who don't get to choose whether
they want their primary erogenous tissue,'' said Dr. Christopher
Cold, a clinical pathologist from Wisconsin. ``It's insane. You're
taking part of the sex organ and removing it. There's nerve endings
there. A man with a complete penis has more erogenous sensations.
The normal response is they would have a greater sex life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cold acknowledged that the debate on the sexual effects of
circumcision obscures the more fundamental issue of whether the
practice should be carried out at all. ``Do we automatically lump
off a little girl's breast as a protective measure because 47,000
women die each year of breast cancer? Do we pull out all the teeth
and say now you can never get a cavity?''
</P>
<P>
   Burleson said she now regrets that her son was circumcised. ``I
feel very badly about it,'' she said. ``I was clearly uninformed.
At 4 years old, my son announced from the back seat of the car that
he remembers when they cut his penis. I felt terrible. If I had the
choice to make again I wouldn't do that, even if my husband said
yes. He wouldn't have any say in the matter.''

TWINS' SPECIAL BOND: DOUBLE TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. _ In his last days, before darkness and
disappointment would finally overpower him, Mark Fitzpatrick made a
mortal promise that he would not keep.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months out of the Army, Fitzpatrick was back home,
training to be an emergency medical technician, and feeling
melancholy about old friends who now seemed mere acquaintances. He
still deeply missed his identical twin brother, Daren, his best
friend and soul mate, who had shot himself to death at his boyhood
home two years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my twin were here, it wouldn't have been so hard because we
would have had each other,'' Mark Fitzpatrick wrote in a college
paper last fall. ``When you're a twin, you're not used to being
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daren was gone. And Mark, 22, was given to dark moods,
introspection that friends and family traced to Daren's suicide at
age 20 and, even further back, to a fatal car crash in 1993. Mark
had been driving, and three people _ two passengers and the driver
of another car _ were killed. Daren, who was a passenger in the
car, was left perilously close to death.
</P>
<P>
   During one of Mark's stormy moods last spring, Amy Fitzpatrick
grew concerned for her brother's well-being. ``I always thought
something could happen,'' said Amy, 24. ``So I told him, `You make
me nervous.' And he said: `You know that I love you and I know that
you love me. And I promise I won't put you through what Daren did.'
''
</P>
<P>
   But then he did.
</P>
<P>
   On a May evening, after returning from Bogie's, a local pub,
Mark Fitzpatrick approached his sister's third-floor bedroom and
softly asked to borrow Amy's cigarette lighter. ``I said, `Yes.
Just make sure you give it back to me in the morning.' He said, `I
will,' '' Amy recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mark Fitzpatrick walked downstairs, pointed his
grandfather's gun at himself, and fired. His body fell 4 feet from
the spot where Daren Fitzpatrick had died in January 1997. It was
the final chapter in the story of identical twins who lived
parallel lives and met identical, self-inflicted deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Now, friends and neighbors can only wonder about the unknowable
bonds between two brothers who, their family says, literally
couldn't live without each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identical twins have a stronger bond than most people can ever
imagine,'' said Nancy L. Segal, a psychology professor and director
of the Twin Studies Center at California State University at
Fullerton. ``They share all their genes in common. They are virtual
clones of one another. They have this enormous compatibility that
evolves from a very early age. Twins have said things like
`watching my twin die was like watching myself die.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Muller's third pregnancy seemed different. She was
bigger. Her breathing was more labored. She was having a difficult
time but all indications showed a single, strong baby. And on a
bright July morning, Daren Scott Fitzpatrick was born. It was 10:05
a.m. He weighed 6 pounds. The nurses unplugged the monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``And all of a sudden, out slipped Mark,'' Muller said. ``I was
literally shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes younger than Daren, Mark was fine. He weighed 5
pounds, 11 ounces and had a little strawberry mark below his
bellybutton, an early identifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's got the mark, thank goodness,'' their mother said.
</P>
<P>
   She dressed them alike and watched them grow. In a neighborhood
of tall trees and wide front porches, the Fitzpatrick twins were
newborn novelties.
</P>
<P>
   The next-door neighbor once called to gingerly report that the
toddlers had managed to open an upstairs window. ``Don't panic,''
she said, ``but the boys are leaning out.'' Once, when an aunt was
baby-sitting, they locked her out of the house. She watched from
the front porch as the twins clambered atop the counter and
gleefully tossed sugar around the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were always into something,'' Muller said. ``They were
mischievous. I always described them as one big brain with four
arms and legs.''
</P>
<P>
   They played Little League baseball together, served as altar
boys at the local Catholic church, and by the time they entered
Monument Mountain Regional High School, they shared a love for
wrestling and adolescent hijinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The twins were the most off-the-wall, crazy guys you ever
met,'' said Brock Foster, a lifelong friend, who rode bikes,
climbed trees, and sneaked into neighbors' pools with the
Fitzpatrick twins.
</P>
<P>
   They were ``all-American boys,'' their sister said. As
teenagers, they dreamed of military careers. They would join
separate branches of the service because, despite their close ties,
they considered serving together a little too ``geeky.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Drucker, 23, a neighborhood friend, said they once
seemed indomitable. ``They were tough Irish,'' Drucker said. ``It
seemed nothing could ever hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mark was at the wheel of Barbara Muller's overloaded Ford Escort
station wagon on that wintry mid-March night in 1993. Daren rode
next to him in front. A high school dance had just broken up and
seven boys were heading south down a curving road that funnels
Route 7 from Monument Mountain into downtown Great Barrington. They
were heading for Friendly's.
</P>
<P>
   A mile south of the school, the car skidded out of control,
colliding with Irene M. Wheeler's Mercury sedan. Wheeler, a
30-year-old mother of two, was killed. So were two of Mark's
passengers, schoolmates Jed M. Blackwell, 15, and Richard L. Morey,
17.
</P>
<P>
   In the front seat, Daren lay critically injured, his legs
tangled, his head wedged under the dashboard. ``I remember him
making this horrible scream because I couldn't do anything for
him,'' Mark would write later in an essay for a community college
course. ``Right before the firemen got us out, Daren told me that
if it was his time to go, he wanted me to know that he loved me
very much.''
</P>
<P>
   As families buried the dead, doctors worked to repair damaged
organs, and police investigators sought to recreate the accident,
Daren fought for survival. The family kept a vigil by his bedside.
His liver was sliced. His spleen and part of a lung were removed.
Doctors put a plate in his sternum.
</P>
<P>
   Mark, treated and released from the hospital, was charged with
three counts of vehicular homicide, placed on pretrial probation
and ordered to surrender his license and perform 200 hours of
community service.
</P>
<P>
   ``That accident changed everybody,'' said Neal Barbieri, 24, a
next-door neighbor who was severely injured in the crash. ``When
you're teenagers, sometimes you think you're immortal. That
accident showed us that that wasn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark wore his guilt like a hair shirt, pouring himself into
court-ordered painting projects while his brother recuperated at
home.

BOOK LOOKS INTO LIVES OF JAPANESE-AMERICAN VETERANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Toshio Whelchel, who served in the Marine Corps
from 1977 to 1981, has compiled an oral history of a dozen
Japanese-American troops in Vietnam in his book ``From Pearl Harbor
to Saigon: Japanese-American Soldiers and the Vietnam War'' (Verso,
$25, 203 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Each man was either born in a Japanese relocation camp during
World War II or is the son of parents who spent time in the camps.
Each experienced prejudice and ignorance, but the reactions are
different.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Yoshikawa remembers the summary executions of suspected
Viet Cong, ``just as it was common to run Vietnamese civilians off
the road, or to call them zips or gooks.'' But, he adds, ``Even
knowing these things took place, my reaction didn't rise to the
level of outrage. The one emotion I experienced most was absolute
boredom.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles Yakao said his mother argued in favor of him going into
the army, pointing to the heroism of the Japanese 442nd combat team
in World War II. ``She was basically saying that the
Japanese-American population has a unique history in this country
because the way we vindicated ourselves was through military
service. She said, `It's one thing if you're from any other
culture, but the way we got out of the internment camps and
established ourselves as fully participating citizens was through
the efforts of the 442nd.'''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of talk about drugs in ``From Pearl Harbor to
Saigon,'' starting with former Marine Marcus Miyatomo, who was born
at Manzanar in 1945. He joined the Marines out of juvenile court
and wound up in Da Nang, where ``we could get drugs as easily as we
could get liquor ... primarily grass and opium.''
</P>
<P>
   Artilleryman Tim Inakawa says ``a routine day in Vietnam was to
start the day loaded, either drinking or smoking pot.'' Melvin
Wadachi talks about cocaine, heroin and liquid opium, saying,
``We'd take two drops of opium, add water, cook it, and then shoot
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Yoshida goes so far as to describe his favorite opium
dens in Nha Trang: ``It cost five dollars per hit and we could stay
there as long as we wanted. The rooms were real dark, with pillows
all around, like in a bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know where Whelchel, who is working on a book on
homeless Vietnam veterans, is going with all this talk of drugs.
``From Pearl Harbor to Saigon'' is far more interesting when it
moves away from drugs and allows glimpses of what it was like to
grow up, as a Japanese-American, in the craziness that was Southern
California in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Inakawa, born in a relocation camp at Tule Lake, Calif., admits
to being ashamed of his Japanese parents, saying, ``When I was
growing up I thought gardening was such a demeaning type of work. I
was always embarrassed that my dad was a gardener.'' He stayed
angry after being drafted, Inakawa says. ``My dad was willing to
have me die in war rather than disgrace the family. I think it
sounds like the old samurai code.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Imayama, who played varsity football, ran with gangs.
``Back then there were the Buddha Bandits from East Los Angeles and
other Asian gangs from the Gardena area. We never got along with
the Gardena people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Yoshida liked nothing better than surfing (``I listened
more to white surf music than the Motown my Japanese-American
friends were into.'').
</P>
<P>
   Wadachi was captain of his gymnastics team and hung around the
Gas House in Venice, listening to bongo music and the poetry of

 GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass.: ... at home.

   Segal said the emotional bond between twins yields a sense of
devotion and a sense of responsibility that is deeply stronger than
among mere siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identical twins are enormously altruistic about their twin,''
the psychologist said. ``They feel incredibly guilty if something
they do might have caused pain for their twin. They feel: I wish it
had been me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, Mark had a real tough time even though we assured
him that it wasn't his fault,'' Muller recalled. ``He kept saying:
`But I was the driver.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Daren Fitzpatrick's view of his future was colored red, white,
and blue. The boy, who had clipped newspaper stories and taped TV
footage about the US triumph in the Persian Gulf War, proudly hung
the American flag in his upstairs room, which was festooned with
posters of the Marine Corps, the Few Good Men he intended to join
after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   But the accident ended that dream. His injuries, a Marine
recruiter told him, disqualified him for service.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was crushed,'' said Brian Mead, a longtime friend. ``He
took down his posters of the Marines. And for a couple of days he
didn't want to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Daren tried to regroup. He enrolled at Berkshire
Community College, majoring in criminal justice, worked part time
as a police officer in nearby Monterey, and talked of moving on to
a big-city force some day.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours before Daren's suicide in January 1997, Monterey
Police Chief Gareth J. Backhaus received a call about a rollover
accident on Route 23. The car was on its side. The driver had
vanished. He called a wrecker and ran the plate, tracing the car to
Daren's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Daren had been driving. He walked away from the wreck his family
now believes may have been a suicide attempt, and was at home in
bed by the time the police called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went upstairs and I said, `Daren did you have an accident?'
And he said, `Yes, but I didn't get hurt.' '' It had been nearly
four years since that awful wreck on Route 7 and the events the
night before were crashing in on Daren Fitzpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   His mother told him the police were on their way over to talk to
him and urged him to get up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came downstairs to put the coffee on,'' Muller said. ``This
was about 5:30 or quarter to 6 and I came to the bottom of the
stairs and I said, `Darren, hurry. They're going to be coming soon.
And he said, `What do you think they're going to do to me?' And I
said, `Nothing. What do you think? They're not going to do anything
to you.' And I just walked 5 feet. Pop! And I just ran upstairs and
there he was.''
</P>
<P>
   He had fired the handgun he used during his police patrols.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have thought that this situation might have something
to do with his career in law enforcement full time,'' Backhaus
said. ``Nobody really knows.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say there is no such thing as a suicide gene. But in
a 1991 study, Segal studied 62 pairs of identical twins and 114
pairs of fraternal twins, of whom at least one had committed
suicide. She found that 13 percent of the surviving identical
twins, who share an exact genetic blueprint, ultimately followed
their twin in suicide, while just 1.8 percent of the fraternal
twins did.
</P>
<P>
   If Mark Fitzpatrick was a candidate to follow his brother's path
to the grave, no one saw it coming. He assured his friends and
family that he would never do that to himself _ or to them. He
studied suicide and wrote about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways suicide is one of the hardest forms of death to
mourn, and most likely will stay with you for the rest of your
life,'' Mark wrote in a college paper five months before he died.
``Following the suicide of someone you care about will cause you to
feel many different feelings, and one of those feelings is
betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   Honorably discharged from the Army when his tour was up in June
1998, Mark was a volunteer for the Great Barrington Fire Department
and for the Southern Berkshire Volunteer Ambulance Squad, where he
was working toward certification as an emergency medical
technician.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very intense young man,'' said Victor M. Lucek Jr.,
president of Berkshire Emergency Training, who listed Fitzpatrick
among his top students.
</P>
<P>
   On the day before Mark's suicide, his class took part in a
simulated accident response drill in which casualties were made up
to appear to have genuine wounds. The instructors made the exercise
especially tough, throwing unexpected hurdles in the paths of the
would-be EMTs. The ``victims'' Mark's team was dispatched to help
did not survive.
</P>
<P>
   That Saturday night, Mark confessed to his mother that
everything had gone wrong _ perhaps triggering nightmarish memories
of the triple fatal accident on Route 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of bothered me,'' Muller said. ``I had this little
funny feeling in my stomach, thinking `is this a disappointment
like Daren had?' I mean it was just something but not enough to
say, `Let me get you help.' He didn't show those signs.''
</P>
<P>
   At the pub that night, friends said Fitzpatrick did not appear
distressed. But after handing over her cigarette lighter to her
brother at home later that night, Amy Fitzpatrick, still not quite
asleep, heard gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran downstairs in the hallway and there were pieces of wood
and dried flowers all over the place,'' she said. ``I peeked in the
door and I just saw the blood. So I ran downstairs and my
stepfather went up and just said: `He did it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the note left behind by Daren, who left his money to Mark
and his personal belongings to his mother, Mark's suicide note was
more personal. ``It was a way of letting us know that it was
something he had to do,'' Muller said. ``I think he knew we would
understand because we understood with Daren.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't live without each other,'' Amy explained. ``They
just weren't the same by themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Goulston, a UCLA psychiatrist and an expert on suicide,
said the twins' suicides probably were rooted in a feeling of
aloneness that most people can't fathom.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men never really healed from the wounds of the trauma on
that icy night,'' Goulston said. ``When you're an identical twin,
one of the things you can always count on is a soul mate. And the
poignancy here is a sudden sense of aloneness. And one of the
common things that all suicidal people feel at the end is emotional
loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   The two brothers, who had been united even in the womb, now lie
next to each other in St. Peter's Cemetery here, where they were
carried by the same hearse from the same funeral home; their
funeral Masses said by the same priest in the church they once
served together as altar boys.

effort to deter North Korea from going ahead with its anticipated
test of a long-range missile, Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright and her counterparts from South Korea and Japan appeal to

   HOLBROOKE-CONFIRM (Washington) _ The prolonged delay of a final

the world's most celestial kitchens, for a price. More and more

caramel tart, a scoop of burned caramel ice cream, and bay leaf ice
cream, too, a chestnut cookie, a black currant gelee, a chocolate
filled with hazelnut cream, an orange macaroon and a white

dish of creamy lemon panna cotta, a coconut tapioca pudding with
cilantro syrup, a chocolate ganache cake, an intense chocolate
caramel tart, a scoop of burned caramel ice cream, and bay leaf ice
cream, too, a chestnut cookie, a black currant gelee, a chocolate
filled with hazelnut cream, an orange macaroon and a white
chocolate square with toasted coconut. And all I did was order
dessert. It was the kind of experience that sticks fast in your
mind, but these days it's not all that uncommon. By Amanda Hesser.

CAMPAIGNS WITHOUT LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Elizabeth Drew, analyst and seer extraordinary,
saw it all coming months before George W. Bush did it. What she saw
on the money politics front is interestingly ignored by the latest
presidential candidate-reformer to step forward, former senator
Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In her latest essential volume, ``The Corruption of American
Politics,'' Drew observes correctly that in the age of unlimited
``soft'' money, any notion of limits on financial contributions to
candidates is absurd. And she warns that the next step will be a
final assault on the last fortress of post-Watergate federal
oversight _ limits on spending, overall and in individual states,
during the primary season in exchange for matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Drew reported, again correctly, that more than one candidate was
seriously considering passing up the federal dough in order to be
able to spend as much money as his pals could collect in increments
up to $1,000. Then she accurately analyzed the meaning of such a
step well before President-in-waiting Bush took it: ``That would
complete the cycle of going back to the Watergate days and before _
when there were no limits at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The point here is not that there is anything corrupt or even
questionable about Bush's astonishing pile of money. The point is
that limits are the window that keeps corruption in the broadest
sense out.
</P>
<P>
   Open that window and a lot can come in besides dirty money and
unscrupulous candidacies. For starters, a limitless campaign can
destroy any remaining pretense that the early-voting states (Iowa,
New Hampshire, Arizona, South Carolina) function as equal
opportunities for a barely funded candidacy to break through.
</P>
<P>
   For evidence, one need look no further on the Republican side
than the fight between one fellow spending unlimited zillions of
his own cash (Steve Forbes) and another one (Bush) now able to
shovel zillions of other peoples' at relatively tiny TV markets.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. Who knows if money is the root of it all (Drew
is neutral), but money is all around the myriad of evils that have
turned so many would-be voters away from politics _ virulent
partisanship, poll-driven politicians, negative campaigning,
full-time warfare that crowds out time for old-fashioned
governance, and the decline of legislative cultures that used to
accommodate and soften ideological clashes in the interest of
progress.
</P>
<P>
   What makes her book all you have to read _ as H. L. Mencken's
Carnival of Bunkum begins even earlier this time _ is its
reflective tracing of the gradual unraveling of all that the
quixotic among us thought had been achieved in the wake of
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   It is often forgotten, but the changes worked rather well until
the mid-1980s. That was when a loophole opened by the Federal
Elections Commission, and first noticed by Drew nearly 20 years
ago, was turned into a canyon as huge, unregulated gobs of cash
began to flow into federal campaigns via the political parties.
Today, the only difference between hard and soft money is that the
former is limited in individual amount and the latter is not and is
an avenue for influence to corporations, unions, and rich people.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech here last week _ understandably overshadowed by the
tragedy off Martha's Vineyard _ Bradley joined the reformers' ranks
in his uphill race against Vice President Al Gore. A great deal of
what he had to say was helpful, and Gore made a tactical goof in
starting a sniping match by surrogates over who was sincere or had
a better record on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting a variation on change ideas pushed earlier in the
decade, Bradley urged a 2-1 federal match for gifts up to $250,
public financing of general elections (including for Congress), and
free TV time via the Federal Communications Commission for
participating candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And all this would be in the context of a flat ban on soft
money, the key idea in the reform legislation that is headed for
its annual collision with the stone wall of Congress. To buttress
his point, Bradley went the extra step of offering to forgo soft
money in next year's general election if he is the Democratic
nominee provided the GOP nominee does the same (fat chance).
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley was silent on the spending loophole for ``hard''
money that Bush has now burst through by opting out of the matching
funds system, setting a huge precedent. One reason involves
concerns about the constitutionality of spending limits under
Supreme Court decisions going back to 1976, though another reason
to study Drew's book is its detailed exploration of the actual
content of those decisions, which leave more room for change than
most realize.
</P>
<P>
   Having been bold in his vision of a less corrupting system,
Bradley should have confronted Bush's choice.
</P>
<P>
   The point is not that Bradley's ideas are headed inexorably
toward enactment in time for the next election. Obviously, they are
not. Rather, the point is that this kind of advocacy establishes
fresh values in the national debate, values well within the bounds
of current public opinion. By contrast, Bradley met that test well
recently in advocating a ban on cheap handguns. And it is the
promotion and election of people pushing the right values that
necessarily precedes action.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, I think it is obvious that we are headed toward an
even uglier, more profligate campaign season. As Elizabeth Drew
shows, when the window is wide open, a great deal more than just
money comes pouring in.

   We were on the runway in Los Angeles, about to take off for
Chicago, when the guy sitting next to me gave me one of those
elbow-nudges that you just hate getting from guys next to you on
the plane, especially at the beginning of a flight. It's the kind
of move that tells you, ``Take out the Walkman now!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see who's in the first row?'' he said in a
conspiratorial tone.
</P>
<P>
   I leaned into the aisle. ``Sorry. All I can see are the backs of
their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Oprah and Stedman!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No last names necessary, of course. I know and you know he
wasn't talking about Oprah McGillicudy and Stedman Kramden _ he was
referring to Oprah Winfrey and her longtime companion, Stedman
Graham. (This was more than a few years ago, when Oprah was merely
rich and famous but had yet to take over the world. These days when
she needs to travel, she has her own personal space shuttle.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure hope this plane doesn't crash,'' said my new buddy.
``Because if it does, all the headlines are going to be about
Oprah. Nobody's going to care about you or me.''
</P>
<P>
   Well. I'd like to think that at least a few people would take
note of my demise _ family, friends, a few random strangers who
always preferred Phil Donahue in his prime to Oprah. Besides, I
think a better reason for hoping a plane doesn't crash is the fact
that it would probably KILL US ALL.
</P>
<P>
   But I knew what the guy meant. Of course Oprah would have been
the headline, then and now. Heck, she could be sharing a plane with
the pope, Sammy Sosa, Al Gore and every member of Limp Bizkit, and
she'd be the headline if (God forbid) something went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I can fault the Oprah-spotter for engaging in such
macabre speculation. Just about anybody who's ever been on an
airplane with a famous person engages in a little gallows humor
about being lost in the shuffle should the plane go down. I've even
heard celebrities telling anecdotes about flying with more
widely-known entertainers and lamenting that they would have been
reduced to a secondary story had disaster struck.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this very scenario played out last week when John
Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette and the woman repeatedly referred to
as ``Carolyn's sister, Lauren,'' all perished in a plane crash.
While Kennedy was among the most famous faces in the world, and
Carolyn had achieved instant celebrity status by virtue of her
marriage to John, nobody outside of her own circle had ever heard
of Lauren until that plane disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen this before _ one or more non-celebrities dying in a
crash that took the life of a famous musician or actor or
politician. When that happens, the names of the un-famous appear in
sidebars or in stories that list the names of ``other victims,'' in
alphabetical order. In death as in life, there are leads and there
are supporting players.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever this occurs, I'm reminded of J.D. Tippit, whose name by
now has been forgotten by everyone save historians and conspiracy
buffs.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Tippit was killed in a plane crash involving a
celebrity; he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   By Lee Harvey Oswald.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Oswald
gunned down Dallas police officer Tippit and then slipped into the
Texas Theatre, where he was apprehended by authorities. While
Tippit was hailed as a local hero and mourned by his fellow
officers, the very circumstances of his death turned him into an
instant footnote.
</P>
<P>
   Tragic and heartbreaking as it was, the death of John Kennedy
Jr. will not have anything approaching the historical impact of his
father's assassination; we all know that. Yet in some ways, Lauren
Bessette has a spiritual kinship with J.D. Tippit. Unknown to all
but their family, friends and associates in life, they were thrust
into the edge of the spotlight because their deaths were connected
to men named John Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be an air of media guilt permeating the coverage
of the candlelight service for Lauren held Saturday night in
Greenwich, Conn. Nearly every story pounded home the point that she
was a person of grace and good character in her own right, and
should be mourned in that matter.
</P>
<P>
   But who was that message for? Anyone who knew the woman before
the nation saw pictures of her luggage washed up on the shore,
before the news channels started serving up her image in a
slow-motion home video _ anyone who knew her already understood
that Lauren Bessette was nobody's footnote.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When he was in his mid-20s and searching quite deliberately for
the style that would transform American fiction, Ernest Hemingway
got this reminder from Gertrude Stein: ``Hemingway, remarks aren't
literature.''
 &HT;    That remark came back to me while reading ``True at First
Light,'' the writer's unfinished fictional memoir, published with a
great deal of hype this month (July).
 &HT;    The Hemingway sound is still there _ that unmistakable rhythm _
but there is something off-putting about the story of the 1953
safari the writer went on with his fourth wife, Mary Welsh.
 &HT;    It's as if Hemingway felt that anything that caught his
attention in the bush was worth writing down. You feel as if every
time Hemingway turns his back, Mary and the local hunters can't
wait to escape from his camp and get out of his sight.
 &HT;    What happened to the writer of the austere ``The Sun Also
Rises,'' the beautiful and sardonic ``A Farewell to Arms''? When
did being Hemingway get in the way of Hemingway the writer?
 &HT;    Creativity is ultimately a mystery, dissolving into the
metaphysics of personality and talent. Still, you can narrow
Fitzgerald's collapse to the '30s, when he was overwhelmed by
Zelda's mental illness, or Faulkner's decline to the '40s, when he
dissipated himself while writing screenplays for Hollywood.
Hemingway himself followed their slides with hardnosed interest.
Perhaps you could do the same, in gentler fashion, with him.
 &HT;    Scholars conventionally ascribe Hemingway's creative dissolution
to drinking and depression, but to me that has always seemed too
simple.
 &HT;    Since World War I, when Hemingway volunteered as an ambulance
driver on the Italian front, he was always drinking and frequently
depressed. In this era, he wrote his best books. He thrived on rest
and then battle. While his tolerance for this up-down lifestyle
lessened over the years, it wasn't what made him fall apart.
 &HT;    He fell apart in the early '40s, on 15 lush acres in Cuba.
Having triumphed with ``For Whom the Bell Tolls'' (1940), Hemingway
left the literary world and moved to the tropics.
 &HT;    As newly released documents from the period _ private letters,
declassified FBI files and other sources _ reveal, he isolated
himself from anyone who knew him as he really was. He confused his
fantasy self (a man of action) with his real self (a man who wrote
about action).
 &HT;    As World War II heated up, he embarked on a parody of his
previous wartime adventures. He formed a ``spy ring,'' which
uncovered little, and chased U-boats with a fishing boat. For
months at a stretch, Hemingway piloted through empty Cuban coastal
waters in search of a whale he would never catch.
 &HT;    Playing these war games, Hemingway stopped writing for the first
time in his career. A short-story collection he promised his
editor, Max Perkins, fell away. Various ideas failed to turn into
actual novels. For 10 years, he published no new fiction.
 &HT;    Finca Vigia, Hemingway's Cuban home, is in the small hill town
of San Francisco de Paula, 10 miles from Havana. Now called the
Museo Hemingway and run by the Cuban government, it is a shrine to
Papa. Each magazine and gin bottle remains where he left it when he
left Cuba in 1960 to sit out the revolution that brought Fidel
Castro to power.
 &HT;    He committed suicide at his second home, in Ketchum, Idaho, in
July 1961, but the Finca waits. The Schweppes inside the tonic
bottles has mostly evaporated, but the caps are still on.
 &HT;    There was an intense thunderstorm under way on the day I arrived
in June, the reverberations knocking the mangoes from the trees.
Tourists can look into the house only from outside, but as a
foreign journalist, I was given a full tour once the rain let up.
 &HT;    Inside the graceful Spanish-colonial building, I saw the study
where Gary Cooper slept on the couch because the beds were too
short for him and the pool where Ava Gardner swam naked. Next to it
were the gravestones of Hemingway's four dogs _ Negrita, Linda,
Black and Neron.
 &HT;    The Cuban government presents the house as Hemingway's private
paradise, but I didn't see it that way. Nothing hurts a writer more
than not being able to write as well as he once did, especially
when the writer is as competitive as Hemingway.
 &HT;    The eight-room house had four separate places to write: a study,
a library, his bedroom equipped with his Royal typewriter and an
office in an adjoining tower (built by Mary in 1947). It was set up
for writing. Hemingway's failure to do so must have been difficult
for him to endure.
 &HT;    Just outside the house lay his escape: the Pilar, Hemingway's
beloved 40-foot fishing boat. In 1973, the Cuban government pulled
the Pilar out of the harbor at Cojimar and placed it on blocks at
the Finca. It is now shielded by a plastic roof.
 &HT;    I knew that Hemingway essentially retreated to the Pilar during
the first three years of World War II, first to fish and get away
from his third wife, the journalist and author Martha Gellhorn,
then to conduct his clandestine military operations.
 &HT;    The Pilar's black oak was still polished to his standards. The
fighting chair, which he never sat in _ he caught his fish standing
up, the same way he wrote _ was waiting for the next fisherman. Up
on the flying bridge, you could see a copy of the drinks rack where
Hemingway lodged his hand grenades.
 &HT;    Gregory Hemingway, 67, the youngest son of the writer, lives in
southern Florida. In an interview, he said that his father had an
irrevocable crisis during the war years.
 &HT;    ``There was a real sea change in him,'' he recalled. ``There was
so much defensive stuff about how great the next book was going to
be that I got the feeling that he definitely thought he'd lost
it.''
 &HT;    Gregory remembered him taking it out on Gellhorn, whom Hemingway
married in 1940. She was a convenient target. She was his peer, his
competitor, in some ways his double. In his letters to her, which
were unsealed last year after her death, Hemingway sometimes calls
her ``brother.''
 &HT;    She was also the wrong wife for a man in turmoil. Gellhorn, like
Hemingway, was substantial. She was solidly built and smoked 40
cigarettes a day. Human frailty did not fit into her worldview. She
once wrote Hemingway that she could never respect the kind of men
``that must have women lick their wounds and flatter them.''
 &HT;    Soon after their wedding, as he struggled on with his story
collection, she accepted an assignment to cover the submarine war
in the Caribbean for Collier's. (She was also working on a novel
set in the Caribbean called ``Liana'' and wanted local details.) He
was furious at the news. Abandonment was upsetting enough, but wars
were his business.
 &HT;    With Martha gone, Hemingway grew anxious at the Finca. The newly
unsealed letters show him writing her often, badgering her to write
back and keeping her up to date on the household, often in
unintentionally comic ways. (``The thing about servants like Luis
is that they've been at it so long they lose their aficion.'')
 &HT;    He complained that an introduction to a war anthology he was
working on was the ``most awful no good piece of writing I've ever
done.'' He had wanted to make a clean statement about the stupidity
of the politicians who had caused the current war, but the
intensity of his convictions made the article hard to finish.
 &HT;    He soon came to feel that writing about the war was beside the
point. He had to do something. A solution presented itself in the
form of the new American ambassador to Cuba, Spruille Braden. He
was a round-faced man with a winning smile and a nice word for
everyone. Braden was status-conscious, Hemingway was famous and the
two men became friends.
 &HT;    Soon the idea came up that Hemingway's wide contacts on the
island might make him useful in regard to Cuba's Falangist problem.
Falangists were Spanish fascists. The American government was
worried that some were in Cuba, signaling the location of American
ships to U-boats and helping German agents infiltrate the island.
 &HT;    Approaching Hemingway was not as odd as it might seem. In those
years, and later, during the Cold War, the U.S. government
frequently asked prominent citizens traveling abroad to report back
on what they saw. Journalists, celebrities and the well-connected
had an excellent cover for going everywhere and looking at
everything. (The O.S.S. was jokingly said to stand for ``Oh So
Social.'')
 &HT;    Indeed, Hemingway had been pressed into service once before. A
declassified O.S.S. document gives a new explanation for a putative
vacation Hemingway and Gellhorn took to Mexico City in 1942.
Hemingway was asked to look into raising a private army of Spanish
Republican exiles to ship to the North African front. He evaluated
the situation and reported back, but the project went no further.
 &HT;    Hemingway liked Braden's offer. He thought of himself as a
natural spy. Intelligence work was like researching a novel you
didn't have to write.
 &HT;    What's more, it would give Hemingway a chance to be a patriot _
and trump Martha in the process. She had researched an article
about the Falangists for Collier's, and the editors had rejected
it. He would show her how it was done.
 &HT;    Braden's code name for the group was the Crime Shop. Hemingway
nicknamed it the Crook Factory. Quickly, Agent 08 _ as Hemingway
rechristened himself _ got to work.
 &HT;    His ``spy ring'' was a cross section of his social circle: a
bartender from his favorite bar, the Floridita; various wharf rats,
and several Basques who fled Spain when Franco won. The unruly
crowd showed up at all hours at the Finca, which they used as their
headquarters.
 &HT;    In one newly unsealed letter to Martha, then on assignment for
Collier's, he captures the atmosphere of a Crook Factory meeting:
``We were just twenty-one ... and twenty-four bottles of wine were
drunk. ... Tommy Shevlin sang some wonderful songs and everybody
threw bottles at Fernando as a form of applause. Chairs were thrown
to express disapproval. ... Thorwald had taken the pistol of the
soldado, who had fallen asleep, and was firing it. ... Juan was hit
on the ear by a loaf of bread and rendered hors du combat. ... It
was an all time high in Basque celebrations.''
 &HT;    Little of use came out of the Crook Factory, which at one point
consisted of six full-time operatives and 20 part-timers. The FBI,
as allergic to competition as Papa was, used its staff to discredit
Hemingway's.
 &HT;    Hemingway announced that Gen. Manuel Benitez, the chief of
police, was training his officers to seize power while Braden and
President Fulgencio Batista were in Washington. The FBI pointed out
that it had agents at Police Headquarters who had seen nothing
unusual.
 &HT;    A Hemingway operative brought in a suspicious box from the Bar
Basque in Havana; the FBI had the box opened and found only a copy
of ``The Life of Saint Teresa.'' A declassified June 1943 memo
reflects the agents' exasperation: Hemingway was just bringing in
his operatives' dispatches with a cover note, not even trying to
investigate their validity or place them in context. He would do
anything, it seems, but write.
 &HT;    J. Edgar Hoover followed Hemingway's operations with bemusement.
He sardonically noted in a memo to two staff members that
Hemingway's ``judgment is not of the best'' and that if he was
drinking as much as he had been ``some years ago,'' Braden was
foolish to use him.
 &HT;    Hoover grew worried, however, when Hemingway told an informant
that he was going to write a book about Braden, his intelligence
work and the FBI.
 &HT;    Consequently, FBI radiograms flew back and forth following
Hemingway's moves, as agents tried to determine if he was putting
pen to paper about his spying adventures. Hoover was probably
relieved when an agent reported that Hemingway had acknowledged
that he was ``doing no writing whatsoever at the present time.''
 &HT;    In April 1943, with FBI prodding, the embassy closed down the
Crook Factory. Hemingway didn't care. He had already found himself
a newer, better assignment: submarine chasing under the sponsorship
of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Although the threat of
German U-boats off Cuban waters was already subsiding, Hemingway
still saw a chance to make his mark on the war.
 &HT;    An aristocratic-looking cabin cruiser, the Pilar was hardly a
boat to take on a 1,000-ton U-boat. Because real, mounted
antiaircraft guns were too heavy for the Pilar's stern, the crew
had to limit itself to Thompson submachine guns, antitank weapons
and those hand grenades in the drinks holder.
 &HT;    For his crew, Hemingway surrounded himself with friends,
including Winston Guest, a millionaire polo player; two Basque
jai-alai players nicknamed Paxtchi and Sinsky, and a dour Catalan
sergeant named Fernando Mesa. The only professional among them was
a Marine communications expert named Don Saxon, who carried around
a submarine listening device known to Hemingway only as ``the
gadget.''
 &HT;    Hemingway obtained a letter from the U.S. Embassy to explain his
activity. Still in the archives of the Finca, it states that he was
conducting scientific experiments with ``a radio apparatus.'' This
didn't quite accord with the American Museum of Natural History
sign he had hung as cover on deck.
 &HT;    Hemingway's sub-hunting strategy recalled the adventure books he
read as a teen-ager. He imagined that German U-boats would spot the
Pilar, surface and come aboard to commandeer its fresh fruit and
fish. Once the U-boat opened its hatch, one of the jai-alai players
would toss a jury-rigged bomb down the narrow opening.
 &HT;    Martha quite rightly warned Hemingway that if they ever did lob
a bomb down a sub hatch, they would all be killed in the explosion.
She berated his ``shaming and silly life,'' which she saw as an
excuse to go fishing with government gasoline and avoid his
typewriter.
 &HT;    But he had found his war. His squad practiced shooting and
throwing grenades at wooden targets with faces painted on them,
which they called ``Hitlers,'' and practiced boarding procedures
and tossing incendiary devices down an imaginary hatch.
 &HT;    Military readiness was slow in coming, as an unpublished passage
from Hemingway's log shows: ``Left Cabanas at 8:30. Out 6 miles for
practice _ Win(ston) erratic _ Paxtchi same _ Fernando N.G. (no
good) Win bothered by gas in stomach _ Fernando stood ground swell
OK. Into Bahia Honda 1 pm.''
 &HT;    Patrick Hemingway, 71, the writer's middle son, sometimes
accompanied his father on the Pilar, much to Gellhorn's
consternation. When I reached him in Montana to ask about this
period, he compared his father to Don Quixote. ``He was losing the
ability to deal with reality,'' he remembered. ``He was just going
crazy trying to make the world better and more pattern-satisfying
than it was.''
 &HT;    On Dec. 9, 1942, with the crew still learning to hit targets,
the Pilar's moment came. Hemingway watched through his ``ten-power
Zeiss glasses'' as a Spanish steamer, the Marques de Comillas,
slowed down in the waters off the north coast, as if for a
rendezvous. Shortly after, he spotted a low gray craft approaching
with a tow.
 &HT;    In a report to the embassy's ONI attache, proudly entitled
``Submarine Sighted on December 9th,'' Hemingway reported that the
Pilar had closed for the kill ``at a trawling speed of seven knots
with lines out from both outriggers to simulate big game fishing.''
At this moment, as they prepared the ``anti-submarine
installations'' (explosives inserted in a fire-extinguisher
canister), something unlucky happened.
 &HT;    ``While we were headed directly toward her a large baracuda
(sic) of 48 pounds hit one of the outrigger baits,'' Hemingway
wrote. While the crew tried to land the fish, the vessel steamed
away.
 &HT;    That was it. Despite not being certain he had seen a submarine,
Hemingway sent the ONI a theory worthy of Simenon, his favorite
mystery writer: ``It would have been possible, due to the ships
encountering each other at the hour of the noon-day meal, for Axis
agents to have been put overboard during the time that passengers
were in the dining saloon without such an operation being any more
noticed, if the men were lowered from a hatch close to the
waterline than would be the picking up or dropping of a pilot under
the same circumstances.''
 &HT;    The FBI later interviewed all the passengers and discredited the
scenario, much to Hemingway's frustration.
 &HT;    In two-month stints over the next year, Hemingway and his crew
kept on patrolling, often 18 hours a day. Occasionally, a trawler
or fishing boat would pass, and Hemingway would note it in his log
alongside the crew's poker scores.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Martha finished ``Liana.'' This sandbagged Hemingway.
During a visit to the Finca, he told Gregory that he was going to
quit writing. ``Let's give Marty a chance _ she deserves one,'' he
said.
 &HT;    In a letter to Gellhorn, Hemingway rationalized things: ``It is
enough of a job to keep everybody's morale up and get the work done
without having to write about it.''
 &HT;    The Pilar's orders ran out in July 1943. Despite Hemingway's
efforts, the Navy wouldn't renew them. Papa closed down the
operation and settled back down at the Finca, only to find Gellhorn
moving ahead on her next project: covering the war in England for
Collier's.
 &HT;    Eventually, Hemingway followed Martha to England, becoming
Collier's front-line war correspondent and her boss. He put himself
through extraordinary, foolhardy risks in France, refusing to duck
when snipers fired or when a shell struck near him. He told his
military friends that fighting Germans was the best job he had ever
had. He seemed a man determined to find death.
 &HT;    Yet when the war ended, he returned to the Finca to write _
though not before blaming Gellhorn, who left him in 1944, for his
difficulty writing.
 &HT;    In the guest bedroom at the Finca, I came upon a copy of
Gellhorn's 1948 war novel, ``The Wine of Astonishment,'' untouched
for 40 years. It was inscribed from Gellhorn: ``For the greatest of
critics ... with the best wishes of his knowing admirer.'' Behind
it was Hemingway's angry response: ``Dear author, Why don't you be
a nice good character and ... ship me my papers, so I can write
another fine book and autograph it for you? The Other Author.''
 &HT;    With great effort he began new work. In 1950, he published
``Across the River and Into the Trees'' _ his first novel written
in Cuba. The critics were savage. He would not easily be brought
down, however. A book, he liked to remind himself, was a battle,
not a war.
 &HT;    He succeeded in finding his voice again briefly with ``The Old
Man and the Sea'' (1952). But ``Across the River'' and ``Old Man''
were sections of a trilogy that never came together; the rest was
published posthumously in 1970 as ``Islands in the Stream,'' in
which his fruitless naval patrols were given a nobler fictional
aspect as a battle against a U-boat crew in which his alter ego,
Thomas Hudson, dies.
 &HT;    Moreover, he was beaten, as he might have put it, by two
unfinished books _ ``The Garden of Eden,'' published in 1986, and
then by ``True at First Light.'' Something had changed in his
relation to his material. What had for so long fed his art _ his
outsize will _ now deformed it.
 &HT;    Shortly after his block began, Hemingway wrote to Martha, ``I
suppose if you are a writer you're a writer till you die or it
dies.'' He knew what had happened, and he knew there was nothing he
could do.
 &HT;    One of the first stories he began upon his return to Cuba was
called ``The Faker.'' It was the story of a man returning from the
war pretending to be a hero. He never finished it.

 &HT;    The Cuban government presents the house as Hemingway's private
paradise, but I didn't see it that way. Nothing hurts a writer more
than not being able to write as well as he once did, especially
when the writer is as competitive as Hemingway.
 &HT;    The eight-room house had four separate places to write: a study,
a library, his bedroom equipped with his Royal typewriter and an
office in an adjoining tower (built by Mary in 1947). It was set up
for writing. Hemingway's failure to do so must have been difficult
for him to endure.
 &HT;    Just outside the house lay his escape: the Pilar, Hemingway's
beloved 40-foot fishing boat. In 1973, the Cuban government pulled
the Pilar out of the harbor at Cojimar and placed it on blocks at
the Finca. It is now shielded by a plastic roof.
 &HT;    I knew that Hemingway essentially retreated to the Pilar during
the first three years of World War II, first to fish and get away
from his third wife, the journalist and author Martha Gellhorn,
then to conduct his clandestine military operations.
 &HT;    The Pilar's black oak was still polished to his standards. The
fighting chair, which he never sat in _ he caught his fish standing
up, the same way he wrote _ was waiting for the next fisherman. Up
on the flying bridge, you could see a copy of the drinks rack where
Hemingway lodged his hand grenades.
 &HT;    Gregory Hemingway, 67, the youngest son of the writer, lives in
southern Florida. In an interview, he said that his father had an
irrevocable crisis during the war years.
 &HT;    ``There was a real sea change in him,'' he recalled. ``There was
so much defensive stuff about how great the next book was going to
be that I got the feeling that he definitely thought he'd lost
it.''
 &HT;    Gregory remembered him taking it out on Gellhorn, whom Hemingway
married in 1940. She was a convenient target. She was his peer, his
competitor, in some ways his double. In his letters to her, which
were unsealed last year after her death, Hemingway sometimes calls
her ``brother.''
 &HT;    She was also the wrong wife for a man in turmoil. Gellhorn, like
Hemingway, was substantial. She was solidly built and smoked 40
cigarettes a day. Human frailty did not fit into her worldview. She
once wrote Hemingway that she could never respect the kind of men
``that must have women lick their wounds and flatter them.''
 &HT;    Soon after their wedding, as he struggled on with his story
collection, she accepted an assignment to cover the submarine war
in the Caribbean for Collier's. (She was also working on a novel
set in the Caribbean called ``Liana'' and wanted local details.) He
was furious at the news. Abandonment was upsetting enough, but wars
were his business.
 &HT;    With Martha gone, Hemingway grew anxious at the Finca. The newly
unsealed letters show him writing her often, badgering her to write
back and keeping her up to date on the household, often in
unintentionally comic ways. (``The thing about servants like Luis
is that they've been at it so long they lose their aficion.'')
 &HT;    He complained that an introduction to a war anthology he was
working on was the ``most awful no good piece of writing I've ever
done.'' He had wanted to make a clean statement about the stupidity
of the politicians who had caused the current war, but the
intensity of his convictions made the article hard to finish.
 &HT;    He soon came to feel that writing about the war was beside the
point. He had to do something. A solution presented itself in the
form of the new American ambassador to Cuba, Spruille Braden. He
was a round-faced man with a winning smile and a nice word for
everyone. Braden was status-conscious, Hemingway was famous and the
two men became friends.
 &HT;    Soon the idea came up that Hemingway's wide contacts on the
island might make him useful in regard to Cuba's Falangist problem.
Falangists were Spanish fascists. The American government was
worried that some were in Cuba, signaling the location of American
ships to U-boats and helping German agents infiltrate the island.
 &HT;    Approaching Hemingway was not as odd as it might seem. In those
years, and later, during the Cold War, the U.S. government
frequently asked prominent citizens traveling abroad to report back
on what they saw. Journalists, celebrities and the well-connected
had an excellent cover for going everywhere and looking at
everything. (The O.S.S. was jokingly said to stand for ``Oh So
Social.'')
 &HT;    Indeed, Hemingway had been pressed into service once before. A
declassified O.S.S. document gives a new explanation for a putative
vacation Hemingway and Gellhorn took to Mexico City in 1942.
Hemingway was asked to look into raising a private army of Spanish
Republican exiles to ship to the North African front. He evaluated
the situation and reported back, but the project went no further.
 &HT;    Hemingway liked Braden's offer. He thought of himself as a
natural spy. Intelligence work was like researching a novel you
didn't have to write.
 &HT;    What's more, it would give Hemingway a chance to be a patriot _
and trump Martha in the process. She had researched an article
about the Falangists for Collier's, and the editors had rejected
it. He would show her how it was done.
 &HT;    Braden's code name for the group was the Crime Shop. Hemingway
nicknamed it the Crook Factory. Quickly, Agent 08 _ as Hemingway
rechristened himself _ got to work.
 &HT;    His ``spy ring'' was a cross section of his social circle: a
bartender from his favorite bar, the Floridita; various wharf rats,
and several Basques who fled Spain when Franco won. The unruly
crowd showed up at all hours at the Finca, which they used as their
headquarters.
 &HT;    In one newly unsealed letter to Martha, then on assignment for
Collier's, he captures the atmosphere of a Crook Factory meeting:
``We were just twenty-one ... and twenty-four bottles of wine were
drunk. ... Tommy Shevlin sang some wonderful songs and everybody
threw bottles at Fernando as a form of applause. Chairs were thrown
to express disapproval. ... Thorwald had taken the pistol of the
soldado, who had fallen asleep, and was firing it. ... Juan was hit
on the ear by a loaf of bread and rendered hors du combat. ... It
was an all time high in Basque celebrations.''
 &HT;    Little of use came out of the Crook Factory, which at one point
consisted of six full-time operatives and 20 part-timers. The FBI,
as allergic to competition as Papa was, used its staff to discredit
Hemingway's.
 &HT;    Hemingway announced that Gen. Manuel Benitez, the chief of
police, was training his officers to seize power while Braden and
President Fulgencio Batista were in Washington. The FBI pointed out
that it had agents at Police Headquarters who had seen nothing
unusual.
 &HT;    A Hemingway operative brought in a suspicious box from the Bar
Basque in Havana; the FBI had the box opened and found only a copy
of ``The Life of Saint Teresa.'' A declassified June 1943 memo
reflects the agents' exasperation: Hemingway was just bringing in
his operatives' dispatches with a cover note, not even trying to
investigate their validity or place them in context. He would do
anything, it seems, but write.
 &HT;    J. Edgar Hoover followed Hemingway's operations with bemusement.
He sardonically noted in a memo to two staff members that
Hemingway's ``judgment is not of the best'' and that if he was
drinking as much as he had been ``some years ago,'' Braden was
foolish to use him.
 &HT;    Hoover grew worried, however, when Hemingway told an informant
that he was going to write a book about Braden, his intelligence
work and the FBI.
 &HT;    Consequently, FBI radiograms flew back and forth following
Hemingway's moves, as agents tried to determine if he was putting
pen to paper about his spying adventures. Hoover was probably
relieved when an agent reported that Hemingway had acknowledged
that he was ``doing no writing whatsoever at the present time.''
 &HT;    In April 1943, with FBI prodding, the embassy closed down the
Crook Factory. Hemingway didn't care. He had already found himself
a newer, better assignment: submarine chasing under the sponsorship
of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Although the threat of
German U-boats off Cuban waters was already subsiding, Hemingway
still saw a chance to make his mark on the war.
 &HT;    An aristocratic-looking cabin cruiser, the Pilar was hardly a
boat to take on a 1,000-ton U-boat. Because real, mounted
antiaircraft guns were too heavy for the Pilar's stern, the crew
had to limit itself to Thompson submachine guns, antitank weapons
and those hand grenades in the drinks holder.
 &HT;    For his crew, Hemingway surrounded himself with friends,
including Winston Guest, a millionaire polo player; two Basque
jai-alai players nicknamed Paxtchi and Sinsky, and a dour Catalan
sergeant named Fernando Mesa. The only professional among them was
a Marine communications expert named Don Saxon, who carried around
a submarine listening device known to Hemingway only as ``the
gadget.''
 &HT;    Hemingway obtained a letter from the U.S. Embassy to explain his
activity. Still in the archives of the Finca, it states that he was
conducting scientific experiments with ``a radio apparatus.'' This
didn't quite accord with the American Museum of Natural History
sign he had hung as cover on deck.
 &HT;    Hemingway's sub-hunting strategy recalled the adventure books he
read as a teen-ager. He imagined that German U-boats would spot the
Pilar, surface and come aboard to commandeer its fresh fruit and
fish. Once the U-boat opened its hatch, one of the jai-alai players
would toss a jury-rigged bomb down the narrow opening.
 &HT;    Martha quite rightly warned Hemingway that if they ever did lob
a bomb down a sub hatch, they would all be killed in the explosion.
She berated his ``shaming and silly life,'' which she saw as an
excuse to go fishing with government gasoline and avoid his
typewriter.
 &HT;    But he had found his war. His squad practiced shooting and
throwing grenades at wooden targets with faces painted on them,
which they called ``Hitlers,'' and practiced boarding procedures
and tossing incendiary devices down an imaginary hatch.
 &HT;    Military readiness was slow in coming, as an unpublished passage
from Hemingway's log shows: ``Left Cabanas at 8:30. Out 6 miles for
practice _ Win(ston) erratic _ Paxtchi same _ Fernando N.G. (no
good) Win bothered by gas in stomach _ Fernando stood ground swell
OK. Into Bahia Honda 1 pm.''
 &HT;    Patrick Hemingway, 71, the writer's middle son, sometimes
accompanied his father on the Pilar, much to Gellhorn's
consternation. When I reached him in Montana to ask about this
period, he compared his father to Don Quixote. ``He was losing the
ability to deal with reality,'' he remembered. ``He was just going
crazy trying to make the world better and more pattern-satisfying
than it was.''
 &HT;    On Dec. 9, 1942, with the crew still learning to hit targets,
the Pilar's moment came. Hemingway watched through his ``ten-power
Zeiss glasses'' as a Spanish steamer, the Marques de Comillas,
slowed down in the waters off the north coast, as if for a
rendezvous. Shortly after, he spotted a low gray craft approaching
with a tow.
 &HT;    In a report to the embassy's ONI attache, proudly entitled
``Submarine Sighted on December 9th,'' Hemingway reported that the
Pilar had closed for the kill ``at a trawling speed of seven knots
with lines out from both outriggers to simulate big game fishing.''
At this moment, as they prepared the ``anti-submarine
installations'' (explosives inserted in a fire-extinguisher
canister), something unlucky happened.
 &HT;    ``While we were headed directly toward her a large baracuda
(sic) of 48 pounds hit one of the outrigger baits,'' Hemingway
wrote. While the crew tried to land the fish, the vessel steamed
away.
 &HT;    That was it. Despite not being certain he had seen a submarine,
Hemingway sent the ONI a theory worthy of Simenon, his favorite
mystery writer: ``It would have been possible, due to the ships
encountering each other at the hour of the noon-day meal, for Axis
agents to have been put overboard during the time that passengers
were in the dining saloon without such an operation being any more
noticed, if the men were lowered from a hatch close to the
waterline than would be the picking up or dropping of a pilot under
the same circumstances.''
 &HT;    The FBI later interviewed all the passengers and discredited the
scenario, much to Hemingway's frustration.
 &HT;    In two-month stints over the next year, Hemingway and his crew
kept on patrolling, often 18 hours a day. Occasionally, a trawler
or fishing boat would pass, and Hemingway would note it in his log
alongside the crew's poker scores.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Martha finished ``Liana.'' This sandbagged Hemingway.
During a visit to the Finca, he told Gregory that he was going to
quit writing. ``Let's give Marty a chance _ she deserves one,'' he
said.
 &HT;    In a letter to Gellhorn, Hemingway rationalized things: ``It is
enough of a job to keep everybody's morale up and get the work done
without having to write about it.''
 &HT;    The Pilar's orders ran out in July 1943. Despite Hemingway's
efforts, the Navy wouldn't renew them. Papa closed down the
operation and settled back down at the Finca, only to find Gellhorn
moving ahead on her next project: covering the war in England for
Collier's.
 &HT;    Eventually, Hemingway followed Martha to England, becoming
Collier's front-line war correspondent and her boss. He put himself
through extraordinary, foolhardy risks in France, refusing to duck
when snipers fired or when a shell struck near him. He told his
military friends that fighting Germans was the best job he had ever
had. He seemed a man determined to find death.
 &HT;    Yet when the war ended, he returned to the Finca to write _
though not before blaming Gellhorn, who left him in 1944, for his
difficulty writing.
 &HT;    In the guest bedroom at the Finca, I came upon a copy of
Gellhorn's 1948 war novel, ``The Wine of Astonishment,'' untouched
for 40 years. It was inscribed from Gellhorn: ``For the greatest of
critics ... with the best wishes of his knowing admirer.'' Behind
it was Hemingway's angry response: ``Dear author, Why don't you be
a nice good character and ... ship me my papers, so I can write
another fine book and autograph it for you? The Other Author.''
 &HT;    With great effort he began new work. In 1950, he published
``Across the River and Into the Trees'' _ his first novel written
in Cuba. The critics were savage. He would not easily be brought
down, however. A book, he liked to remind himself, was a battle,
not a war.
 &HT;    He succeeded in finding his voice again briefly with ``The Old
Man and the Sea'' (1952). But ``Across the River'' and ``Old Man''
were sections of a trilogy that never came together; the rest was
published posthumously in 1970 as ``Islands in the Stream,'' in
which his fruitless naval patrols were given a nobler fictional
aspect as a battle against a U-boat crew in which his alter ego,
Thomas Hudson, dies.
 &HT;    Moreover, he was beaten, as he might have put it, by two
unfinished books _ ``The Garden of Eden,'' published in 1986, and
then by ``True at First Light.'' Something had changed in his
relation to his material. What had for so long fed his art _ his
outsize will _ now deformed it.
 &HT;    Shortly after his block began, Hemingway wrote to Martha, ``I
suppose if you are a writer you're a writer till you die or it
dies.'' He knew what had happened, and he knew there was nothing he
could do.
 &HT;    One of the first stories he began upon his return to Cuba was
called ``The Faker.'' It was the story of a man returning from the
war pretending to be a hero. He never finished it.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;     I should be riding on the float in the hit parade/instead of
sitting on the curb behind the barricade/another verse in the
doormat serenade.  _ ``Put Me on Top,'' Aimee Mann
 &HT;    
 &HT;    July 1999: Aimee Mann can't sit around these days waiting to
hear what the record-label executives think of her new album. She
is far too busy doing things for herself _ choosing press photos,
writing her own bio, running to Fed Ex and, literally, licking
stamps. But things weren't always this way.
 &HT;    July 1998: Aimee Mann is holed up for the fourth day in a row in
the windowless, hyper-air-conditioned bunker that is Mad Dog
Studios in Burbank, Calif., recording two new songs for her third
solo album, trying her best to create some magic.
 &HT;    Outside, the sun is ridiculously bright, the heat stifling, the
whir of traffic numbing. Adding to the unreal out-of-time feeling
that 10-hour days in a dimly lighted, soundproof room can produce
is the fact that the singers Sheena Easton and Jeffrey Osborne are
in the next studio shooting a Christmas video.
 &HT;    Mann is here today because shortly after she delivered seven new
songs to Geffen Records, she was told by her manager, Michael
Hausman, that the A&AMP;R executives ``didn't hear a single.''
 &HT;    A few days after she got the bad news, she said, more resigned
than angry: ``There's never a single unless you're earmarked for
greatness in the first place. I wish it would be called for what it
is. Like, 'These are good songs, but they're just not grabbing me
for some reason.' Or, 'Production-wise, this doesn't fit into the
format of radio right now.' Or some sort of practical thing. But it
never is. 'Well, it's just not a single.' How can I correct that?
'Oh, well then I'll write some magical thing that will put you into
a trance.' But having said that, sometimes I think it is magic.
Sometimes I think they think it's magic. So they're waiting for
magic.''
 &HT;    She heaved a big sigh _ and then gathered steam. ``But don't
tell me it's not a single. A single is a record company's job: to
pick out a song that they think is good and make sure people hear
it. It's also incidentally, their job to come up with a way of
selling records if, say, I don't have a single at all. What I still
have is a great record with great songs.''
 &HT;    I asked Mann if she is ever tempted simply to give them what
they want.
 &HT;    ``I've sort of tried to do it,'' she said. ``I'll keep it in
mind. I'll think, 'Well, this is pretty catchy' or 'I've kept this
simple enough lyrically so that any moron can understand it.' But
anytime I do that I get bored, and then I don't know how to finish
the song. I really have to force myself to write and get into the
studio, because this is the only career I have.''
 &HT;    So, having resigned herself to the necessity of incanting some
magic and delivering a single, one of the two songs that she is
recording at Mad Dog today is called ``Nothing Is Good Enough.''
 &HT;    Mann is known for writing clever, disappointed love songs that
can also be read as damnations of the music industry. Lyrically and
musically, they are sharp and subtle, angry and vulnerable. Her
last solo record's title _ ``I'm With Stupid'' _ was a sardonic
reference to her choice in both lovers and labels. ``Nothing Is
Good Enough,'' however, is a bit more direct. It's a song about
defeat and the misery of delivering new material to an indifferent
record executive.
 &HT;    ``It doesn't really help that you can never say what you're
looking for,'' she sings with aching sadness over a beautiful piano
arrangement that brings to mind the classic pop of Burt Bacharach
and Carole King. ``But you'll know it when you hear it/know it when
you see it/walk through the door/so you say, so you've said/many
times before.''
 &HT;    It's a testament to her melodic gift and emotional phrasing that
such a subject could sound so lovely, so memorable. It sounds _
could it be? _ like a single.
 &HT;    The next day, Mann, the session musicians and a producer, Buddy
Judge, are back in the studio, and Judge, who worked on the song
after Mann left the night before, plays a polished version of it.
 &HT;    Mann is unhappy. She fears that the piano is too pretty, too
``ballady,'' and sounds too much like another song on the album.
``It's not the Moody Blues '70s flavor I was looking for,'' she
says, slumped in a chair. ``It's one thing to have a song be played
as a gentle, sad ballad and another to be played as an 'Expletive
you,' which is what it's supposed to be. That anger can certainly
be shown and be played. It's very hard for me to show it in the
vocal, which never translates.''
 &HT;    A decision is made to bring in a different drummer, and Mann
tells the piano player to play his part as if he were ``a drunken
clown.'' Hausman suggests a ''John Lennon, immature piano player''
approach.
 &HT;    While waiting for a new drummer, Dan MacCarroll, to arrive (he
is also an A&AMP;R man at a small, independent label), Mann sits down
with Hausman for a talk. ``If this record doesn't sell,'' he says
grimly, ``Geffen's going to drop you.''
 &HT;    Mann sinks farther into her chair and says nothing.
 &HT;    ``I just want you to know the worst-case scenario and to begin
to think about what you're going to do.'' Hausman _ ever the
optimist _ throws out a few suggestions: Go on a small acoustic
tour! Start a new band! Play bass for someone else!
 &HT;    Soon MacCarroll arrives. As Mann strums out the song for him on
her bass guitar, he says, ``What beat do you want me to play it
in?''
 &HT;    She stares at him for a few seconds through her poker-straight,
bleached white hair. ``How about the hit-single beat?'' she says,
and they both snicker. ``You're an A&AMP;R guy now. You know the
hit-single beat.''
 &HT;    As she steps into the booth and puts on her headphones to record
the song once more, she says into the microphone _ her dry, reedy
voice now amplified through every speaker in the studio: ``Whatever
you do, don't ruin it for me. This is my last chance.''
 &HT;    If this truly is Aimee Mann's last chance, it will be a small
tragedy. At 38, she is widely considered by her peers and music
critics alike to be one of the finer songwriters of her generation.
She has collaborated with Elvis Costello, Jules Shear and Chris
Difford and Glenn Tilbrook of Squeeze _ all purveyors of the same
kind of sophisticated pop music that gets little airplay these
days.
 &HT;    When alternative rock's perennial sweetheart, the
singer-songwriter Liz Phair, met Mann backstage at a concert a few
years ago, she knelt before her.
 &HT;    Writing in Time magazine in 1996, David Thigpen called ``I'm
With Stupid'' one of the ''catchiest pop albums of the year,
brimming with poised three-minute mini-masterpieces,'' and said
that ``Mann has the same skill that great tunesmiths like McCartney
and Neil Young have: the knack for writing simple, beautiful,
instantly engaging songs.''
 &HT;    And yet she remains largely unrecognized by radio and the
music-buying public. Bad timing, dumb luck and a rebellious
attitude are partly to blame, but Mann's history of being
mishandled by three different labels over a full decade reads like
a cautionary tale about the struggle to be a serious recording
artist in the contemporary music market.
 &HT;    Mann is not a complete stranger to fame and commercial success.
One of the first songs she ever wrote by herself, ``Voices Carry,''
went to No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1985, and the album went
on to sell more than a million copies, and made her band, 'Til
Tuesday, early MTV favorites at the height of New Wave.
 &HT;    By the second and third 'Til Tuesday albums, Mann was flowering
as a serious songwriter, and the synthesized dance-pop of the first
album gave way to a more mature acoustic sound (''Strummy songs in
D,'' Mann says), which did not go over well with either her label
or her bandmates _ even as the acoustic sound of Suzanne Vega and
Tracy Chapman was becoming popular.
 &HT;    Mann recorded three 'Til Tuesday albums for Epic Records in the
'80s and then left the label after a rancorous battle over creative
differences. It took her three years to get out of her contract,
and all the while Epic wouldn't let her record elsewhere or release
any new material.
 &HT;    ``That was the beginning of the funk,'' Hausman says, ``the
record-company roulette with contracts and lawyers. That really
changed Aimee.''
 &HT;    Dick Wingate, who originally signed 'Til Tuesday to Epic and was
the executive producer on ``Voices Carry,'' quit the label after
the first album, leaving Mann with no champion.
 &HT;    ``She's the model of an artist who has been chewed up and spit
out by the music business,'' Wingate says. ``But Aimee herself is a
pain. She's not a good people person. She's never really allowed
herself to be close to anyone at any record label, including me.
And the more bad luck and disappointment she had, the more
distanced she became from the process.''
 &HT;    In 1991, Mann released the material she had been working on for
Epic as her first solo album, ``Whatever,'' on Imago, a new
independent label owned by Terry Ellis. Just as her second solo
record was about to be released, Imago lost its distribution deal
and financing and went into a tailspin. Ellis would neither release
her album nor let her out of her contract for almost two years.
Ellis finally sold the album to Geffen, which then signed Mann in
1994 and nearly a full year later released ``I'm With Stupid.''
 &HT;    In 1997, Mann married the singer-songwriter Michael Penn (Sean's
older brother), another critics' darling who, like Mann, had a hit
single, ``No Myth,'' early in his career in 1990 and has since
suffered through two labels botching his next two releases. (Penn
has a new album due out in September from 57 Records, a division of
Epic.)
 &HT;    The couple have been keeping busy, though, cobbling together a
new kind of middle-class rock career making music for films and
performing Tuesday-night shows together at Largo, a sort of mellow
rock supper club in West Hollywood.
 &HT;    Since Largo opened two and a half years ago it has become the
home for a group of wayward singer-songwriters, including Elliott
Smith, Fiona Apple, Rufus Wainwright, Jon Brion, Grant Lee Phillips
(of the band Grant Lee Buffalo) and the godmother of the
underappreciated, Rickie Lee Jones.
 &HT;    Their music can best be described as adult alternative pop. Put
more simply, it's mature music. Brion shot a pilot for VH1 that
tries to transport the Largo vibe to TV, and some have suggested
that Largo is the perfect model for the kind of smaller, focused
record label that could lovingly and successfully break what the
industry deems ``difficult'' artists like Mann.
 &HT;    Another comfort zone for both Mann and Penn has been the film
industry. He has found work as a composer for the director Paul
Thomas Anderson's movies, including ``Boogie Nights'' and ``Hard
Eight,'' while she has had songs on a dozen soundtracks in the past
few years.
 &HT;    Anderson, a Largo habitue and Fiona Apple's live-in boyfriend,
has practically written his new film, ``Magnolia,'' starring Tom
Cruise, around eight Aimee Mann songs. ``Simon and Garfunkel is to
'The Graduate,''' Anderson says, ``as Aimee Mann is to
'Magnolia.'''
 &HT;    Music artists stand to gain from the independent movement in the
film industry. Elliott Smith's song ``Miss Misery'' appeared in Gus
Van Zandt's ``Good Will Hunting'' and was nominated for an Academy
Award. His performance on the Oscars in 1998 surely provided him
with the largest audience he'll ever reach.
 &HT;    Says Brion of Mann's work on ``Magnolia,'' due out later this
year, ``That might be an alternative way of letting the world see
that this is really a good batch of material.''
 &HT;    Indeed, with the example of artists like Ani DiFranco, who
successfully started her own label, Righteous Babe, and the hotly
contested MP3 technology, which allows listeners to download music
from the Internet, artists suddenly have more motivation than ever
to circumvent commercial taste and traditional _ some say
soon-to-be-moribund _ means of distribution. Many artists believe
that the industry's blindered focus on youth and singles will force
their hands.
 &HT;    ``People in my demographic aren't considered the juicy part of
the record-buying public,'' says Gail Marowitz, 40, vice president
of creative services at Sony Music (and Mann's personal art
director and best girlfriend). ``They think we're already old _
even though we buy plenty of records.''
 &HT;    By January, there's good news. Mann has been picked up by
Interscope, and has presented a dozen songs for an album,
``Bachelor No. 2.'' On March 22, at a big meeting with the three
principals at Interscope _ Jimmy Iovine, Ted Fields and Tom Whalley
_ she finds out Iovine hasn't yet listened to the record. He tells
Mann he'll listen to it and call her in two days. He never calls.
 &HT;    Finally, the truth _ the bad news _ comes. ``They don't like the
record,'' she tells me.
 &HT;    By the following week, Mann is finally taking steps toward doing
something she probably should have done long ago: becoming
sovereign. Her lawyers are negotiating a price to buy back her
master recordings from Interscope. Hausman has hired someone to
build a Web site. And he and Mann are exploring the possibilities
of starting their own label. Mann would like to call it Superego
Records.
 &HT;    ``If Aimee sold 70,000 records independently,'' Marowitz says,
``she would be making more money than if she sold 300,000 on a
major label. And Aimee's good for 70,000, and she'll get major
distribution. Ultimately, it's a very good thing.''
 &HT;    In June, Mann gets booked on four Lilith Fair dates in early
August: Buffalo, Boston, Hartford and Jones Beach _ and says that
there may even be a record for sale by then.
 &HT;    ``I'm feeling good,'' she says of her newfound independence,
``because I'm tapped into something that I'm more suited to.'' The
decadelong major-label nightmare is finally ending.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    For a homeless shelter's annual charity auction not long ago,
Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist, donated a breakfast with
himself at Buck's Restaurant.
 &HT;    Buck's is a bustling diner in Woodside, Calif., a
single-intersection hamlet nestled into an oak grove at the base of
the San Mateo County foothills. The booths at Buck's are
upholstered in ocher Naugahyde and the menus have the feel of
political-action newsletters and the owners are mighty proud of
their coffeecake.
 &HT;    Buck's also happens to be the place where Netscape and many
other high-tech companies were hatched.
 &HT;    ``Breakfast at Buck's'' was sold off by way of the Internet site
Ebay at the end of February; 78 bids after the auction started, a
budding Manhattan entrepreneur named Mark Hernandez offered to pay
$4,400 for the privilege of flying out to Silicon Valley two weeks
later to present his business idea.
 &HT;    That might sound like a lot of money to have breakfast with
someone, but Jurvetson is a venture capitalist with a reputation _
young, enthusiastic, open-minded.
 &HT;    He can be found at Buck's most mornings. He bounds in like a
kangaroo, exuberant, flashing a joyous smile, his youthful face
tanned from his noon-hour games of ultimate Frisbee.
 &HT;    He is generally more dapper than his colleagues, wearing a
charcoal Czechoslovakian hand-made suit over a cobalt shirt with
faint royal blue pin-stripes. His tie picks up these colors
perfectly; the black wing tips on his large feet shine. In the
plastic window of his wallet is the bridal portrait of his wife of
eight years, Karla, who is a psychiatrist at Stanford.
 &HT;    He has a prototypical resume for a Silicon Valley VC: earned
bachelor's and master's degrees from Stanford, designed microchips
at Hewlett-Packard, learned management consulting at Bain &AMP; Co.,
returned to Stanford for his MBA and then beat out 250 other
applicants for a position at Draper Fisher, the venture firm.
 &HT;    Prototypical resume, except for the date column: As an
undergrad, he tricked the registration computer _ which blocked
signing up for more than 20 units _ by penciling in just two units
of credit on what were five-unit classes. In this way, he was able
to take eight classes at once and finish in two and a half years
with an A-plus average.
 &HT;    Think that's fast? The conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley is
that it takes three years to learn the craft. Jurvetson made
partner in six months. He was 28.
 &HT;    Venture capitalists' favorite unit of measurement is the factor
X. They live life on multiplication scale, and anything less than X
is inconsequential. When they invest, they ignore 12 percent or 15
percent or 18 percent returns. They start to take notice when they
see potential for 10X returns.
 &HT;    In this lingo, Jurvetson blasted through college at nearly 2X
the normal rate, and made partner at 6X speed. Now he's
accelerating _ straight into what could be a precarious stretch of
road.
 &HT;    Only 32, Jurvetson is in for the summer of his life, with no
fewer than 11 of the Internet-related companies he has backed (Wit
Capital, Goto.com, Tumbleweed and Netzero among them) at various
points along the road to an initial public offering.
 &HT;    The brand name he has built for himself with investments in a
couple of other successful Internet start-ups _ his firm's
specialty and the hottest destination for venture capital _ will be
put to the test. That's because the market's taste for Internet
stocks appears to have soured.
 &HT;    Dave Marquart, a Silicon Valley veteran who was the only venture
investor in Microsoft and the co-lead investor of Sun Microsystems,
warns: ``To be a bona fide venture capitalist, you have to go
through a complete cycle. Those who've entered the business since
the mid-'90s have never seen a down cycle. Everything has been to
the right and up _ very up.''
 &HT;    To understand why Jurvetson is a folk hero for so many of those
looking to convert their dreams and visions into Net wealth,
consider what happened in February 1996.
 &HT;    Sabeer Bhatia was an immigrant from India with zero experience
running a company, zero experience in consumer products and zero
experience in software. (He had been a hardware engineer at Apple.)
He was Jurvetson's age less two years, or J - 2. Bhatia had already
been turned down by 21 other venture capital firms. He had produced
no prototype, not even a graphic printed on a piece of paper.
 &HT;    What he did have was what Jurvetson called ``hallucinogenic
optimism'' and one intriguing idea, which he sketched out on a
conference room white board.
 &HT;    Jurvetson invested $300,000 to buy 15 percent of the project.
Less than two years later, the company that emerged from that
meeting, Hotmail, was sold to Microsoft for $400 million. Jurvetson
became an instant legend, the guy every young entrepreneur wants to
meet, even if it means paying 250X the cost of breakfast at Buck's.
 &HT;    Increasingly, successful venture capital firms are sheltering
themselves from the hail of unsolicited business plans by invoking
the Inverse Rule of Referrals: All good ideas come by referral, so
if it didn't come by referral it must not be a good idea.
 &HT;    Here's how a typical venture firm might catalogue the incoming
slough. Administrative staff scans the first paragraph of the cover
letter for a referral by a ``trusted third party,'' which is
entered in a database. Partners scan the database; they'll look at
the plan only if they trust the referral.
 &HT;    But Draper, Fisher, Jurvetson has cultivated a reputation for
ignoring that rule. The firm is located in Seaport, a sailing
harbor in Redwood City _ psychologically far from VC ground zero,
Sand Hill Road (but close enough to zip there in 10 minutes for a
meeting).
 &HT;    The problem with referral networks, as DFJ sees it, is that as
the venture capitalists age, so does their referral network,
cutting them off from the original thinkers. At DFJ they say they
read every one of the 5,000 plans sent to them each year. Theirs
was the first venture capital firm to run an advertisement.
 &HT;    DFJ is a ``seed'' firm, meaning it gets in on the first round of
financing for nascent businesses. ``Getting companies started is
the hardest part,'' says Tim Draper, the firm's founder, ``and it's
the most rewarding _ both financially and personally.''
 &HT;    To Jurvetson, it's even more rewarding than being an
entrepreneur. ``I get bits and pieces of several success stories,
sort of a highlight reel,'' he says.
 &HT;    Jurvetson has succeeded so far by making himself accessible to
the kind of young people who he figures come up with unusual ideas
_ as opposed to what the industry calls ``Me, Too'' product. One
recent month's ``Me, Too'' was on-line gift registries. He saw 30
business plans on that concept. The month before, it was
Web-calendar companies. He saw three Web-calendar plans out of Sun
Microsystems' employees alone.
 &HT;    Having lunch in San Francisco one day, he bumped into an old
friend who said he had left Netscape to found his dream start-up;
without much tact, Jurvetson jokingly blurted out, ``I hope it's
not another Web-calendar company!'' His friend's face fell. They
always think they're the only ones with the idea.
 &HT;    ``Truly original thinkers tend not to be entrepreneurs who've
spent 10 years at Cisco and can be trusted to know what they're
doing,'' Jurvetson explains. ``They tend to be 26 years old and
highflying. They often have a very childlike mind, with some
naivete. We're impressed by people who don't know what can't be
done.''
 &HT;    Just as the wild success of venture capital firms has made them
magnets for business plans, it has made them extremely popular with
fund investors (which tend to be pension plans, university
endowments and insurance companies). At a typical VC firm, money
under active management has gone up 40X; the number of partners to
manage that money has gone up only 4X. It's now common to raise
$350 million to $500 million every couple of years.
 &HT;    When Draper Fisher Jurvetson mailed out prospectuses for its
most recent fund, the firm received 3X the pledges it needed. The
partners drew the line at $180 million _ but even that is a huge
sum to deploy among early-stage firms, and easily the biggest fund
DFJ had ever raised.
 &HT;    VC firms have a fat incentive to raise more and more money,
because they get paid in two ways. First, when investors in a
specific fund are paid back after a set period of time has elapsed
(typically 10 years), the venture firm keeps 20 percent of all the
profits. Second is the gravy train: a 2.5 percent annual management
fee paid by investors, regardless of performance.
 &HT;    To deal with all the incoming money, most firms are ratcheting
up the size of investments, especially on secondary rounds, when a
company that has survived the seed stage needs large cash
infusions.
 &HT;    That means sticking with start-ups that have a high likelihood
of growing not just big but gargantuan, with billions of dollars in
annual sales. The Amazon of pharmacies, the Amazon of insurance,
the Amazon of auto parts _ consumer markets so big that even a
small slice of them guarantees a stellar payoff. They're not really
start-ups, they're bulk-ups. They put on weight fast and flex their
muscles and try to scare competitors off the beach.
 &HT;    But as Jurvetson sees it, something has been forgotten in this
process. Sure, it's cool to make so much money. And sure, it's cool
to be able to buy hair dye and condoms from the privacy of home.
But on-line superstores aren't creating new markets, and though
they might evolve the technology of E-commerce, they're not
revolutionizing it. They're just big Web sites. Where's the
adventure in that kind of venture?
 &HT;    Seed investing requires a special kind of hunger. Jurvetson's
parents were immigrants from Estonia, and he was reared in Dallas
by the creed that what he was to make of his life was entirely up
to him; there were no entitlements.
 &HT;    In an undergraduate psychology class, he answered a series of
Enneagram questions meant to divine his character type. He so fit
the description of a Type 3, the Performer (as in star performer),
that he was asked back in following semesters to lecture about the
traits of Type 3's: tremendous need for achievement, with an inner
drive to do something beyond the ordinary.
 &HT;    That drive is why he belongs dead center in the creation zone of
the new economy: where there's constantly a new goal to keep him
from getting bored, and where he has all of Silicon Valley as an
audience to perform for.
 &HT;    He seems very similar in character to the headstrong young
entrepreneurs he deals with, and perhaps that is partly why they
mind-meld with him so well.
 &HT;    At no time was this more clear than the day he drove across the
Dunbarton Bridge to meet Joe Chen, the CEO of a very new start-up,
See U There.com. Chen had 12 employees working in the living and
dining rooms of his Union City home. Jurvetson admits he's a sucker
for this kind of raw fertile atmosphere, and he grooved on it for a
while that day, talking to the employees and soaking up their
ambitious energy.
 &HT;    The whole point of money is that it's transferable legal tender,
that it retains its value no matter who possesses it _ your million
dollars is just as valuable as my million dollars. With venture
capital, that's not always the case.
 &HT;    Chen already had two other venture firms ready to give him the
million dollars he needed.
 &HT;    ``Literally, they are screaming at us, asking when we are going
to close the deal,'' Chen explained as we sat down at his
conference table in the garage. But he would rather have
Jurvetson's million dollars. His pitch: a plan to build an Internet
site to capture the largely untapped $60 billion market for event
planning. Jurvetson seemed inclined to invest (and two days later,
did).
 &HT;    Chen is J + 1 years old. He wanted Jurvetson's technical
fluency, but also a certain kind of cultural chemistry _ the
difference between working with someone who is just like your
father and working with someone who is just like you. As Chen puts
it, ``He's not some stiff suit walking in here.''
 &HT;    ``The hotmail story reached us even in Singapore,'' says
Eng-Siong Tan, the CEO of a start-up called Third Voice. Tan is J +
4 years old. ``It resonated and became part of the folklore of the
valley that he was willing to invest where 21 other firms had
passed. We knew Steve would be someone who gets our idea.''
 &HT;    Tan and eight other Singaporean engineers uprooted and came here
cold. They crammed into a cement-block storage warehouse in Foster
City, their front door an aluminum roll-up gate. In November, Tan
pitched Jurvetson.
 &HT;    Third Voice would make software that allows users to post
comments, viewable only by other users, directly onto the front
page of any Web site. It's the Web equivalent of empowering people
to spray-paint the State Capital. Jurvetson got it: This could do
to on-line chat what Ebay did to classified ads.
 &HT;    Internet companies are like Bazooka bubble gum. It takes a lot
of chewing and manipulation _ a tremendous amount of effort _ to
get the first bubble started. Then, with the slightest additional
effort, a mere exhale, it expands 100X. For a while it's customary
to double in size every month. That's what Tan is about to go
through. He's ready to exhale.
 &HT;    The first of Jurvetson's 11 IPO-bound companies _ Wit Capital,
an Internet investment bank _ went public early in June, right on
the heals of a disastrous week for Internet stocks. In late May,
Juno Online and Ziplink not only failed to post triple-digit
first-day returns, they both dropped below the offering price. Two
other IPOs were postponed.
 &HT;    Suddenly the center of the Internet boom seemed to a lot of
people like a scary place to be. But Wit went out and and finished
its first day up 85 percent _ a figure that would have been a
disappointment just months before, but now looked strong. And
Jurvetson sounded as chipper as ever.
 &HT;    Yes, some of the insane pops of early 1999 probably won't be
back, but Jurvetson says that only means offerings are being priced
more fairly and supply and demand are synching up. But the Internet
is the economy, he insists; businesses that still think it's just a
fad are in denial.
 &HT;    Of his IPO-bound companies, only one is considering putting off
its public offering by a quarter, he adds, and there is nothing in
his voice to suggest fear or unease about the future. That's what
the Type 3 description doesn't capture: This is a guy having time
of his life. The default setting on his face is a birthday-boy
smile.
 &HT;    And why not? ``I get to have the Steve Jobses of the next
century come to me and make their pitch. I can't define a better
recreation activity, let alone a job, that would be better than
that.''

 By PO BRONSON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    What were you doing 12 weeks ago?
 &HT;    Twelve weeks ago was Nirav Tolia's last day on a pretty enviable
job. He is 27, and in addition to managing the marketing of
Yahoo!'s E-commerce properties, he had represented the company on
television more than 100 times.
 &HT;    Almost nobody leaves Yahoo!, but Tolia had just heard a really
interesting start-up idea from a friend, Naval Ravikant, who had
recently left  Home. It took Tolia about one day to decide, and the
following morning he resigned.
 &HT;    Soon after Tolia's last day at Yahoo! he and Ravikant were
joined by one of the highest ranking engineers at Netscape,
Ramanathan Guha, who was cooking up an idea very similar to
Ravikant's on the back burner of his big brain. By the end of the
week, they were five strong.
 &HT;    Eleven weeks ago, despite not having a single line of code
written or even a paper sketch of the Web site they wanted to
build, they got $8 million in seed financing from venture
capitalists _ half from Benchmark Capital, which had financed Ebay,
and half from Capital, where Naval Ravikant was camping out as
entrepreneur in residence. This gave the start-up what is believed
to be one of the highest seed-round valuations ever.
 &HT;    Nine weeks ago, they brought on Lou Montulli and Aleksander
Totic, two of the six founding engineers of Netscape. Eight weeks
ago, they moved into a second-floor gabled loft in Mountain View,
Calif., and began grinding out 15-hour days, seven days a week _
but of course these guys had done that before.
 &HT;    In a spring when it had started to seem to some Silicon Valley
veterans that all the big original ideas were gone, theirs was a
lightning rod for talent. The new director of business development,
Dion Lim, began to cut deals with other Web sites to import their
data feeds.
 &HT;    Seven weeks ago, they started hiring category managers. Six
weeks ago, it became clear to Guha that enough of the original
programming was already done, and he could switch hats from coder
to manager. Five weeks ago, their venture capitalist from
Benchmark, Bill Gurley, came by the office for his first look-see.
He was blown away: ``This is, unequivocally, the fastest I have
ever seen a start-up move.''
 &HT;    Four weeks ago, they began to cut distribution deals; two weeks
ago, they settled on their marketing plan; and now, having reached
a critical mass of 31 people, they are set to launch their Web
site.
 &HT;    In 12 weeks, the amount of time it might take an average person
to decide what kind of hedge to plant in the backyard, they built a
company from scratch. An instant company, or what is being called
in Silicon Valley a ''second-generation Web company.''
 &HT;    Not so long ago, it seemed incredible that a Web company could
be born in a mere two years. But rather than going back to normal,
the pace of creation in Silicon Valley now seems to be speeding up
even more. Any Web company that starts out today and takes two
years to get up and running is likely to be left in the dust.
 &HT;    In first-generation Internet companies, the founder and a few
college buddies moved into a garage that they decorated with Nerf
guns and green army men. In second-generation Internet companies,
the staff coalesces not from friendships but from respect for
mutually complementary skill sets.
 &HT;    They skip the garage phase, engage two real-estate brokers and
make simultaneous bids on three office spaces, hoping one comes
through. They move in over the weekend and by Monday have it
decorated with Nerf guns and green army men.
 &HT;    In first-generation Internet companies, the staff resigned from
monolithic software corporations or took leave of business school
or jumped ship on brand-manager positions at Procter &AMP; Gamble.
Nobody had Internet experience; they learned by making mistakes, of
which there were many. The purpose of the Internet was unclear.
 &HT;    Now, companies are being formed by staff members who have years
of know-how. And they see the Internet, above all, as a place to
buy things. Some $301 billion was generated by the Internet economy
in 1998, with an annual growth rate over the past four years of 174
percent.
 &HT;    Because of the way high-tech employees are compensated, there
are likely to be a great number of second-generation start-ups in
the next year. The notorious stock options that add up to so much
paper wealth usually take four years to fully vest. For the early
movers on the Internet, the four years are coming up. And the
golden handcuffs are coming off.
 &HT;    This particular second-generation internet company has managed
to recruit top people who were still handcuffed _ what people in
the Valley call ``the unhirables.'' Naval Ravikant walked away from
what at the time was $4 million worth of unvested  Home stock
options. Guha walked away from probably more than $4 million (a
figure he is contractually forbidden to confirm) at America Online,
which had acquired Netscape.
 &HT;    Sabrina Berry's previous employer, CommTouch Software, was
planning to go public. Berry walked away from all of her shares in
that company. For Montulli to join, he resigned from a hot,
well-financed start-up called Geocast Network Systems. At the time
 &HT;    Tolia left Yahoo!, the unvested options he left on the table
were worth $10 million. But, he insisted, it didn't matter to him
if it was $20 or $20 million _ he has a dream to pursue.
 &HT;    ``People are going to think I'm nuts,'' said Tolia, rolling his
eyes.
 &HT;    ``Can we not talk about this anymore?'' Guha said. ``It's
painful to dwell on.''
 &HT;    Six weeks ago, the engineering team walked to In-N-Out Burger
for lunch. Crossing an overpass above Highway 101, they paused at
the rail.
 &HT;    ``This team has been responsible for many of the key features of
Netscape Navigator,'' Guha said. ``These guys can point to any of
these cars passing underneath and say: 'That driver has almost
certainly used my code. And that driver. And that one.' We want to
build something that has that kind of influence. We want to build a
site that everyone will use.''
 &HT;    So what's the idea that is inspiring so many to jump? Until this
week, they've kept everything secret, operating under the code name
``Round One.''
 &HT;    In fact, not even people who come in to interview for a position
learn the idea their first day. Several hours of vague conversation
seem to be leading up to the grand presentation, but alas, the
applicant is sent home with a preliminary offer, setting out salary
and options and title _ and no clear sense of what the company will
do. If the candidate is sold on the team, then she or he comes back
for a second round.
 &HT;    Only at the end of that next day does she sit down in front of a
whiteboard with Ravikant and Tolia and hear something like this:
 &HT;    As the Web becomes an infinite supply of goods and services,
goes the pitch, people crave guidance on what and where to buy. So
far, the great number of on-line shopping guides present
quantitative, machine-sorted and machine-generated data _
comparisons of product prices and specifications. But what
consumers need (Ravikant and Tolia contend) is a recommendation
that gets beyond that _ the advice of someone they trust, someone
just like them.
 &HT;    So imagine a Web site, Epinions.com, which would be a sort of
Zagat-for-everything, a site consisting entirely of consumer
opinions or reviews of anything you can buy. Epinions.com itself
will sell nothing at all _ it has no warehouse, no trucks on the
back end.
 &HT;    The money would come from deals Epinions.com cuts with companies
that do sell things. Every time an ``E-pinion'' prompts a reader to
click ``Buy,'' the company will earn a tiny commission on the
resulting sale.
 &HT;    At the start, the E-pinions on Epinions.com will be culled from
existing sources, guiding users through aggregations of expertise
from the four corners of the Web. But the key to the whole idea is
to make Epinions.com participatory, taking advantage of what I call
the Tom Sawyer model. Write and post a short review of any product
on Epinions.com, and you can earn a few pennies every time the
review is read by another user.
 &HT;    By letting readers rate the usefulness of the E-pinions, the
most trusted ones will float to the top of every category. As Ebay
is a marketplace for products, Epinions.com dreams of becoming a
marketplace for ideas. If it catches on, like Ebay, then everything
snowballs, and these hobbyist-reviewers function as sliver-time
virtual employees who do all the work for you.
 &HT;    ``Everybody is an expert at something,'' they kept repeating
around the Epinions.com office; they hope their site will be the
place where everyone shares their expertise.
 &HT;    Similar logic has been welling up in the collective unconscious
of Silicon Valley, and most E-commerce sites are already adding
some form of E-pinion to their Web pages. Productopia, Deja.com,
Cnet, Amazon.com _ everyone's hiring editors and bringing back the
old-fashioned, well-trusted written word.
 &HT;    Of course, sites that both sell goods and review them are
subject to criticisms of bias. Epinions.com would be the first
company to start up doing E-pinions and only E-pinions, hoping to
be as Jell-o is to flavored gelatin.
 &HT;    And that's it. Then again, what was Yahoo! at the start but just
a Yellow Pages to the Web? The point is that job recruits with
demonstrable talent are buying in to give it a go. And they know
that in the short and unpredictable history of Internet businesses,
success has often come down to getting the details right, fast.
 &HT;    No time to waste. Ravikant and Tolia's business plan (which
consisted of 16 sparse slides) had no financial projections and no
budget. They negotiated for $8 million, enough that they wouldn't
have to go back for more until well after launch. They had no idea
what it would cost to pull together the E-pinions they would need
to stock the site, but they budgeted $5 million, just to be safe.
 &HT;    The first weekend in their new digs, the parts for their desks
arrived from Home Depot _ 25 solid wood doors, 100 4-by-4 legs and
400 metal braces. Despite this formidable team of engineering
talent, in eight hours of off-and-on tinkering they couldn't
correctly assemble any desks. Finally they called a carpenter who
had done this before, and he started building two desks an hour.
 &HT;    But then, going through the start-up experience usually bonds a
team together. There are those occasional ``Breakfast Club''-like
days when workers' inner lives get revealed to each other. This
bedrock of goodwill gets the team through hard times later. Going
through it at second-generation speed only allows brief bonding
moments.
 &HT;    At the all-hands meeting five weeks ago, Tolia announced that he
would shave his head if the company met its official launch date.
This is a guy whose E-mail was ``the-face yahoo.com'' for a good
reason _ a hair is never out of place on his head. ``When you're
wondering why you're here at 2 in the morning, think about my cue
ball,'' he said.
 &HT;    Everybody howled with laughter. Then Totic went over to his
computer and pulled up an ancient Web page, from way back in 1994.
Digital photographs were posted from the period when the original
Netscape engineers shipped Navigator 1.0. There at the top of the
page was a picture of Montulli _ who is even more of a sharp
dresser than Tolia _ with his head completely shaved. Then everyone
really laughed.
 &HT;    After Ravikant left  Home, he would still see old colleagues at
parties. The comment he heard from them time and time again was:
``It's amazing you walked away from all that money. I wish I was
brave enough to take the chance.''
 &HT;    So why did they walk away from all that money? Take it as a
given that they all believe in the commercial viability of the
idea, but beyond that, their comments are all over the map. One guy
talked blatantly about wanting ''plane money,'' and how you weren't
even a player in the Valley with less than $100 million. A few
plead that they just want to live the start-up experience, and the
money they've earned has bought them the unconditional freedom to
pursue that dream.
 &HT;    Now they are at the takeoff point, and their first-generation
experience can't help them. The next 12 weeks will be an even
greater challenge: the goal now is to turn a brand-new site into a
hive, one that has 80 percent of all E-commerce categories covered
well in advance of the crucial Christmas buying season. They are
blindly gambling that they have the right incentives and the right
filtering mechanisms in place. Ready. Fire. Aim.

money they've earned has bought them the unconditional freedom to
pursue that dream.
 &HT;    Now they are at the takeoff point, and their first-generation
experience can't help them. The next 12 weeks will be an even
greater challenge: the goal now is to turn a brand-new site into a
hive, one that has 80 percent of all E-commerce categories covered
well in advance of the crucial Christmas buying season. They are
blindly gambling that they have the right incentives and the right
filtering mechanisms in place. Ready. Fire. Aim.

 By PETER LANDESMAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: World rights, except for the UK, until further notice  
 &HT;    Before John Myatt was sentenced to prison in February for his
part as a forger in perhaps the most ingenious and damaging art con
of the 20th century, he lived in a humble cottage on a narrow lane
in the idyllic Staffordshire village of Sugnall, a three-hour drive
northwest of London.
 &HT;    To his neighbors, he appeared to be an unremarkable painter who
had never established a style with which to spawn a career.
 &HT;    He also wrote catchy pop tunes. If Myatt was known for anything,
it was for a hit single, ``Silly Games,'' which made the British
Top 40 in 1979.
 &HT;    But beginning in 1986, Myatt discovered that he could paint like
the masters, and for the next nine years he led a secret and
stunningly successful professional life as a painter.
 &HT;    Braque, Matisse, Giacometti, Le Corbusier, all became part of
his repertoire. He faked their styles with such virtuosity that his
paintings passed for the real thing.
 &HT;    Then, one morning in September 1995, Myatt opened his front door
to walk his young son to the school bus and found policemen in his
yard. A plainclothes officer introduced himself as Jonathan Searle,
a one-time painter, restorer and art historian, and now detective
sergeant at Scotland Yard.
 &HT;    Myatt, 50, sturdily built with the toughened hands of a laborer,
nodded with resigned expectancy and invited the policemen inside
for tea. Then he asked if could walk his son to the bus.
 &HT;    While he did, the officers ransacked the house. Upon returning,
Myatt stood in the studio with Searle, surveying the chaos.
 &HT;    ``Do you like this one?'' Myatt asked, pointing to a competent
if undistinguished drawing of his son.
 &HT;    Searle nodded sympathetically, but was amazed by what looked to
be paintings by Giacometti, Chagall, Braque and Dubuffet hanging
about the room. Drawing pads lying around showed sketched studies
for works by Giacometti, Le Corbusier and Ben Nicholson.
 &HT;    Myatt confessed on the spot to having drawn and painted what the
police later said were about 200 forgeries in the styles of nine
modern masters and personally delivering them to London, one
roughly every six weeks, to a man by the name of John Drewe.
 &HT;    Scotland Yard already suspected Drewe of masterminding the sale
of Myatt's forgeries (and perhaps those of at least one other
painter, still unidentified) through the auction houses Christie's,
Sotheby's and Phillips, as well as reputable dealers in London,
Paris and New York.
 &HT;    Then Myatt told Searle something the police didn't know: that
he'd made most of the pictures out of an easily detectable
household emulsion paint developed in the mid-'60s, decades after
most of the paintings were supposed to have been executed. In some
cases, he used K-Y Jelly as a medium to add body and fluidity to
his brushstrokes.
 &HT;    Myatt had no idea how many millions had changed hands on account
of his paintings, but estimated that he had earned as much as
$165,000 over the years, some of which was deposited into a Swiss
bank account in his name. The painter immediately offered to return
the $30,000 he still had and to help snare Drewe.
 &HT;    Seven months later, on April 6, 1996, after recording
conversations between the partners, detectives raided Drewe's home
in the tony London suburb of Reigate, where they found hundreds of
documents from the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Tate Gallery and
the Institute of Contemporary Art.
 &HT;    Sitting on Drewe's kitchen table were two catalogues missing
from the V. and A.'s National Art Library, still in the museum bag
that Drewe had used to smuggle them out. There were rubber stamps
bearing the authenticating seals of the Tate and of an order of
monastic priests; receipts for the sale of paintings across
continents going back decades; certificates of authenticity from
the estates of Dubuffet and Giacometti; also the more mundane
instruments of document forgery: scissors, razors, correction
fluid, glue, tape.
 &HT;    As police and art experts soon discovered, forging masterpieces,
as Myatt had done, was the least of it. Drewe's real genius lay in
his ability to authenticate Myatt's works through bogus provenances
_ the history of a work of art, from its creation through its
purchasings and exhibitions to its current ownership, crucial
elements in the sale of any picture.
 &HT;    It would turn out that over the previous 10 years, Drewe had
systematically infiltrated some of the most security-conscious art
archives in the world, altering the provenances of genuine
paintings to establish a lineage making way for Myatt's mostly
unexceptional forgeries, and then seeding the collections with
false records that provided the pictures with instant heritage. The
scale of the corruption is unprecedented. The method is too.
 &HT;    Archivists may never know how much of their libraries have been
compromised. Of the approximately 200 ``masterworks'' Myatt painted
and Drewe sold, the police have located only 73. Drewe did more
than slip phony pictures into a market hungry for important
contemporary art _ he altered art history.
 &HT;    The police call the con ``the biggest contemporary art fraud the
20th century has seen.'' The British prosecution office declared
Drewe a menace to Britain's cultural patrimony.
 &HT;    The scandal has not only upset the market for the artists Myatt
forged, but it has also exposed the art industry as its own worst
enemy _ too reliant on sources of authenticity that are vulnerable
to manipulation and riddled with conflicts of interest that invite
corruption.
 &HT;    Drewe's story says less about his own brilliance than about the
readiness _ if not the willingness _ of the art world to be
deceived.
 &HT;    ``It's one of the most extensive frauds in the visual arts,''
says Glenn Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art. ``What
distinguishes this case is how methodical Drewe was, and how well
he understood the process of validation. His manipulation of the
system is as interesting and troubling as the forgeries
themselves.''
 &HT;    When Drewe found him, Myatt's life was in wretched shape,
emotionally and financially. His wife had recently abandoned him
and their two young children, and he was left to scratch out a
meager living teaching art in the local schools.
 &HT;    ``I spent all day teaching other people's children and had no
time for my own,'' he told me this spring in Brixton Prison, in
southwest London, where he was serving a one-year sentence for
conspiracy to defraud. (He was released in June.) ``I wasn't doing
my own painting. I needed to find a way to work at home.''
 &HT;    A few years before, a friend had offered to pay him $400 to copy
a painting by the French Post-Impressionist Raoul Dufy. He copied
the picture and Dufy's signature so masterfully that his friend
told him his painting was fooling art experts.
 &HT;    ``I thought it was funny,'' Myatt says with a shrug, insisting
he didn't give it another thought until he became desperate to stay
at home with his children. In 1986, he placed a classified ad in
Private Eye, a satirical London biweekly: ``19th- and 20th-century
fakes for $240.''
 &HT;    He received a call from a ``Professor Drewe,'' who said he was a
nuclear physicist in need of paintings to decorate his home. Drewe
asked first for a Matisse, then a Klee, then two marine paintings
in the style of 17th-century Dutch masters.
 &HT;    Myatt would meet Drewe at London's Euston Station to deliver the
rolled canvases. They'd have a pint together. Myatt began to
confide in Drewe about the turmoil of his divorce. Drewe offered
advice and comfort and eventually invited him to his home. ``I saw
the size of his house,'' Myatt says, ``his Mercedes, his clothes,
his manner.''
 &HT;    Drewe told Myatt that in addition to his work for the Ministry
of Defense, he was associated with British Intelligence. He pulled
back his jacket to reveal two pistols in shoulder holsters.
 &HT;    ``I was very much your creature,'' Myatt would later say to
Drewe in court. ``I found you hypnotizing and challenging and a
very exciting person to be around.'' One day Drewe asked Myatt what
style he wanted to paint in. Myatt told Drewe he'd always relished
the idea of painting in the Cubist style. Myatt soon painted Drewe
a Braque.
 &HT;    One evening in 1986, Drewe called Myatt with news. ``'I took one
of your paintings to Christie's, and they said it was worth
$38,000,''' Myatt recalls Drewe as saying. ``That was the moment
that the legitimate business stopped and the crime began. He said
to come down to London and we'll talk it over. I said: 'I can't
believe it. Are you aware it's painted in emulsion paint?''' He
pauses. ``My vanity was quite ghastly,'' he says. ``The mistake
occurred here. My reaction was to express an interest.''
 &HT;    Drewe's timing, in many ways, couldn't have been better. By the
mid-'80s, the art market was generating unprecedented profits and
front-page headlines.
 &HT;    Jasper Johns' ``False Start,'' which cost $3,150 in 1960, sold
for $17 million in 1988. Picasso's ``Yo Picasso'' sold for $47.9
million in 1989, more than twice the preauction estimate. In 1990,
Van Gogh's ''Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' a painting whose
authenticity is still controversial, was bought by a Japanese
collector for a record $82.5 million. The prices of pictures even
by obscure artists skyrocketed. Myatt's ``masterpieces'' were
suddenly hot commodities.
 &HT;    The painter took trips to Coventry Cathedral to copy Graham
Sutherland's studies for his huge tapestry of Christ in His glory.
He meditated on Giacometti reproductions, then took five hours to
paint a picture that eventually sold for $175,000.
 &HT;    Myatt moved on to Ben Nicholson, Nicolas de Stael, Le Corbusier,
Matisse, Roger Bissiere, glorying in painting his way through
20th-century art history. His unorthodox formula of emulsion and
K-Y Jelly was fast-drying, allowing him to paint quickly, if
obsessively. ``I took no trouble technically,'' he says. ``There
was a negligence to everything I did.''
 &HT;    Even so, his pictures were passing as genuine and selling for
tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars. He was enjoying a
financial success he could never have approached by painting
Myatts. Perhaps no other forger of his or any other time has worked
so prodigiously and in so many styles.
 &HT;    ``It was a kind of addiction,'' he says, then shakes his head
sadly. ``It was shocking, it quite terrified me. The moment they
started to restore them they would know what they were faced
with.''
 &HT;    But Drewe calmed his nerves by telling Myatt, who a year before
had been lovelorn and broke, how brilliant he was, how rich he
would get. ``I was flattered into thinking I was a man of
importance,'' Myatt says, although he concedes he had an ``abiding
sense of unreality, that this wasn't really happening, that this
would all end in tears.''
 &HT;    Before Myatt, the most successful forgers of our time counted on
the brute force of their pictures, imitating one or two giants of
art so that the paintings' discovery would be splashy news, the
reclamation of a ``lost masterpiece.''
 &HT;    Hans van Meegeren aped Vermeer in the 1930s and '40s; the
flamboyant Tom Keating did Rembrandt in the 1950s, and Eric Hebborn
copied Augustus John, Corot and others of their ilk.
 &HT;    Hard information on the quantity of bogus art sold is difficult
to come by, in part because fraud, when discovered by dealers and
auction houses, is usually kept secret to boost public confidence
in the art market.
 &HT;    Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, has said that during his tenure, a full 40 percent of the
artworks considered for purchase by the museum were phony or
overrestored. Geraldine Norman, the British art journalist credited
with exposing Keating and Hebborn, says that at least 10 percent of
the pictures purportedly made by major Impressionists are fake.
 &HT;    Some experts say that as much as 60 percent of the Giacomettis
on the market are fake, at least in part as a result of Drewe's
con. Forty percent of pictures supposedly from the Russian
avant-garde era are almost certainly forgeries. The widows of
Modigliani and Chagall were accused of selling certificates of
authentication.
 &HT;    Salvador Dali, lying on his deathbed in a stupor, is said to
have been fed thousands of sheets of blank paper to sign for fake
lithographs. In a grotesquely sad twist, the Italian painter
Giorgio de Chirico was caught back-dating new pictures to a time,
20 years previously, when his work was popular and in heavy demand,
in effect forging himself.
 &HT;    Modern art, in particular, seems especially vulnerable to fraud.
Its abstractions are sometimes difficult to understand or grasp,
and a modern painting is often loved less because of its intrinsic
quality _ its beauty, as conventionally understood _ than because
of the identity of the painter, its mark of social status.
 &HT;    Says Hoving: ``When the collector gets what he wants and he's
told it isn't real, he says, 'I don't care, to me it's a Renoir.'''
Even though one forged Giacometti, a 1955 ``Nu Debout'' Drewe sold
to two New York dealers, is obviously lacking in the artist's
typical depth of field and manic linearity, one of the dealers
maintains, ``I still think it's one of the best Giacomettis I've
ever seen.''
 &HT;    As Geraldine Norman puts it, many collectors' interests in art
``are reflections of social climbing and romanticism about names, a
thousand things that have nothing to do with the surface of the
work of art you are looking at.''
 &HT;    A forger's chief motivation is typically intellectual
gamesmanship. Embittered by the spurning of his own work, he takes
satisfaction in suckering the entire art world en masse, then
pulling aside the curtain, exposing himself as a renegade genius
and the art experts as the frauds and fools.
 &HT;    Drewe had a different strategy: to deliver low-profile paintings
in high volume, make multiple hits for hundreds of thousands of
dollars _ which would not attract unwanted attention _ rather than
a few jackpots worth millions.
 &HT;    In fact, Drewe changed and fabricated so many records at both
the Victoria and Albert and the Tate, and with so many different
artists, that the directors of both museums admit that they may
never know how much of their collection has been corrupted.
 &HT;    And the scandal has reverberated in the United States. Lowry,
for one, is deeply concerned about MOMA. ``We take our role as a
public institution very seriously,'' he says. ``That means
providing as much access as possible to research documents. The
thought that we have to think about restricting access is
profoundly troubling.''
 &HT;    Once Drewe was discovered, Lowry says, a process of reverse
screenings took place on both sides of the Atlantic. Records were
scoured, paintings were re-examined, all to purge the system. ``It
will take years, probably, before it is fully accomplished,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Drew is now serving a six-year sentence for conspiracy to
defraud and multiple counts of forgery; he is appealing his
conviction.
 &HT;    If his success provides any lesson, it is that the art world's
aura of sophistication creates a false sense of security that makes
it especially vulnerable to what was, in the end, a confederacy of
mediocrity.
 &HT;    Myatt's sloppy pictures and Drewe's litany of far-fetched cons
should have been no match for such sophisticated auction houses,
scholars and dealers. But in the end, the system's multiple lines
of defense _ dealers, galleries, auction houses, museums, archives,
world-class experts _ proved all too permeable.
 &HT;    Yet, one might ask, if a picture brings esthetic pleasure and is
beloved before its fictitious pedigree is exposed, and the only
person who loses money is a collector probably wealthy enough to
absorb the loss, then where exactly is the problem?
 &HT;    As Van Meegeren said at his 1947 trial for forgery about a
Vermeer he had faked: ``Yesterday this picture was worth millions
of guilders, and experts and art lovers would come from all over
the world and pay money to see it. Today, it is worth nothing, and
nobody would cross the street to see it for free. But the picture
has not changed. What has?''

 By CHARLES C. MANN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Ever since the news broke in March that the FBI discovered that
Wen Ho Lee, a researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory, had
filled one of his computers with top-secret files about
nuclear-weapons design, the lab has been vilified in Congress for
its lack of computer-system security.
 &HT;    But computer-security professionals have not joined the chorus.
 &HT;    For them, the Los Alamos case simply exemplifies the inherent
difficulty of controlling the flow of digital information _ not
just in laboratories, but anywhere.
 &HT;    The heart of these problems is that computer networks _ and the
Internet _ are extremely difficult to protect.
 &HT;    ``The only system that is truly secure is one that is switched
off and unplugged, locked in a titanium safe, buried in a concrete
vault on the bottom of the sea and surrounded by very highly paid
armed guards,'' says Eugene H. Spafford, director of the Purdue
Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and
Security. ``Even then I wouldn't bet on it.''
 &HT;    Computers can be secured better only if users accept Draconian
restrictions that make their systems much harder to use _ which, as
a rule, users refuse to do. Alas, the risks of willful ignorance
are growing.
 &HT;    Never have the methods of attack been so powerful and easy to
use. Never has the Internet made it possible to disseminate those
methods everywhere in minutes. And never have so many livelihoods _
and lives _ depended on systems so vulnerable to attack.
 &HT;    ``I can't say that 1999 will be the year when a blowup
happens,'' says A. Padgett Peterson, chief of information security
at Lockheed-Martin. ``But what I can say is that, compared to what
is possible, what we have seen so far has been almost benign in
nature.''
 &HT;    Roughly 8,000 researchers are scattered about the 43-square-mile
campus of Los Alamos. Each one has a computer. Many have more than
one. Almost all are wired, one way or another, into a laboratory
network. Additional thousands of administrators and support
personnel have access to computers. So do the 3,000 visitors who
work temporarily at the laboratory each year.
 &HT;    This year, 450 of the employees are foreign citizens, including
more than 30 from Russia, China, North Korea and seven other
``sensitive'' countries.
 &HT;    Keeping track of what these thousands of people are up to is
difficult, to say the least. Los Alamos' efforts to do so
illustrate both the difficulty of the task and why users so often
rebel against their own security measures.
 &HT;    Los Alamos _ like other facilities with classified work _ gave
scientists a ``black'' computer for their secret material and a
``white'' computer for contacting the outside world. Lee worked
with 300 other researchers in the weapon-design group, known
melodramatically as the ``X Division.'' All the researchers had
both machines chewing up real estate on their desks.
 &HT;    In theory, scientists are not supposed to copy work from one
machine to the other; in practice, the temptation is strong.
 &HT;    ``The military insists on reviewing all the software you put on
your black computer,'' says Jeffrey I. Schiller, network manager
for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a director of the
security group for the Internet Engineering Task Force, the ad hoc
international body that develops technical standards for the
Internet. Such a review process, invariably, is slow.
 &HT;    ``It guarantees that their systems are up to three years out of
date. You want to write a report with the latest version of
Microsoft Word on your insecure computer or on some piece of junk
with your secure computer?''
 &HT;    The superior usefulness of the unclassified systems, Schiller
speculates, may be why the former CIA chief John Deutch was caught
last year with top-secret files on his home computer.
 &HT;    ``People load up the classified stuff on their white computer,
then delete it,'' Schiller says. ``But you do that enough times,
you start to lose track.'' Eventually, the white machine becomes
gray.
 &HT;    Military installations try to contain classified data by
``air-gapping'' their networks. Recognizing that they cannot
control the flow of material within a network, they seek to fence
off the entire network _ maintaining a literal gap of air between
the computer and all connection to the outside world.
 &HT;    That is more easily said than done; computers can transmit
information in multiple ways.
 &HT;    To air-gap its computers, the National Security Agency not only
controls modems, floppy disks, Zip drives, optical disks, CD-ROMs
and Ethernet cards, it installs ``blacker boxes'' _ special devices
that prevent data from leaking out through the power cable.
 &HT;    That is not enough, says Simson Garfinkel, the author, with
Spafford, of ``Practical Unix and Internet Security.'' ``It's very
difficult to be sure data is ever actually taken off a hard
drive,'' Garfinkel says. ``You might think you could just wipe the
disk but that won't do it.''
 &HT;    He says the military used to safeguard data by grinding up old
disks. Now that doesn't work anymore. Tiny pieces of hard drives
can contain sizable amounts of information.
 &HT;    According to a rough calculation by Garfinkel, a
one-sixteenth-inch-square piece of a 6-gigabyte hard drive can hold
750,000 bytes _ enough for a 300-page book. ``A spy could remove a
hard disk, grind it up and smuggle out the data in little pieces
like pocket lint,'' he says.
 &HT;    Los Alamos has split off all machines with secret information
from all machines with access to the Internet, according to John
Morrison, deputy director of the lab's computing, information and
communications division.
 &HT;    Since the controversy, when researchers have access to both
networks, the lab eliminates their floppy drives to block them from
copying files between them. It is demanding that researchers on
classified projects communicate electronically only over encrypted
lines. It is telling people not only to turn off their cell phones
but to remove the batteries. It is doing enough, in fact, to drive
the users crazy.
 &HT;    ``In theory, cutting the cable works great,'' says Dan Wallach,
a security researcher at Rice University. ``Nobody from outside can
attack you or steal your files. Except suddenly you can't do as
much stuff as you used to. And then people start feeling their
security system is a pain in the neck, so they take active steps to
subvert it.''
 &HT;    Laboratories are especially prone to such sabotage, because they
are filled with people who know a lot about computers. Eventually,
compromises are made, and the original problem comes back.
 &HT;    ``Suppose people at Los Alamos are collaborating with people in
Britain,'' says Jon R. David, an internationally recognized
security consultant who is the senior editor of the journal
Computers and Security.
 &HT;    ``They have to talk to somebody in the UK by computer, and so
the lab arranges this encrypted line, which promises to be secure.
But is it true? No. The information on the line is safe, because
it's encrypted, but everything else _ the machines at the other
end, the connection points _ can be attacked, and have been
attacked successfully.''
 &HT;    By coincidence, his point was precisely demonstrated to me last
spring. A man I have come into contact with is an officer in Army
intelligence. It is safe to say that this man is greatly concerned
with security in general, and with computer security in particular.
His facility too has two networks _ one classified, one very
classified _ with security precautions much like those being
installed at Los Alamos.
 &HT;    In March, the computer virus Melissa flooded more than 100,000
computers across the world. Seizing users' machines, it E-mailed
copies of itself to the top 50 names in their address books (if
they used a particular Microsoft program), and so on, until
hundreds of networks were swamped by a mail storm of Melissa
copies.
 &HT;    The Army intelligence man I contacted knew all about Melissa. On
his classified network _ his guarded, protected, sealed-off network
_ he had received some 80 copies of the virus.
 &HT;    A network's security problems, of course, are not only due to
its users. There are all the folks outside who are trying to break
in. A terminological note: Computer cognoscenti use the word
``crackers'' to refer to the vandals who bust into computer systems
illicitly; ``hacker,'' in their lexicon, is reserved for expert
programmers and network administrators.
 &HT;    The people who disabled the Web sites of the FBI, the
Departments of Energy and the Interior, the Senate and the White
House last May were crackers. And when, soon after, the Pentagon
took its Web site off the air to shore up security, it feared being
cracked, not hacked.
 &HT;    These cracking incidents disturbed security researchers _ but
not because the break-ins were unusual. Crackers went after the
U.S. military more than 250,000 times in 1996, the most recent year
for which official estimates are available, and thousands _ perhaps
tens of thousands _ actually broke in.
 &HT;    Nor were the attacks disturbing because they succeeded in doing
permanent damage. (They didn't.) Nor were the crackers able to make
off with classified data _ the breached networks had none (in
theory, anyway).
 &HT;    What distressed security researchers is how far these crackers
got, considering that they almost certainly labored under the
handicap of having no idea of what they were doing.
 &HT;    Most crackers are what real hackers refer to disdainfully as
``script kiddies.'' Just as the great majority of Netscape or
Explorer users have no idea how the software puts Web images on
their screens, the great majority of crackers blindly try out
scripts _ routines written and posted on the Internet by the tiny
number of crackers who know something about programming.
 &HT;    From a network administrator's point of view, the result is like
being besieged by a million monkeys randomly firing catapults _
some of them, by virtue of their sheer numbers, are bound to get a
hit.
 &HT;    ``You see it all the time,'' Schiller says. ``Someone slips in
with some incredibly sophisticated technique.''
 &HT;    Even as the number of script kiddies rises, the ``malware'' _
the security maven's term for malicious software _ they use is
becoming more sophisticated, dangerous and rapidly disseminated.
 &HT;    Last year, Microsoft issued 20 software updates to stop
break-ins. In the first six months of this year, it released 22.
Bruce Schneier, president of Counterpane, a computer-security
company in Minnesota, calls 1999 ``a pivotal year for malicious
software'' _ the year that problems really have become serious.
 &HT;    The line was crossed first by Melissa, which caused such havoc
that it obscured the antics of an almost equally unpleasant virus
known as CIH or Chernobyl, so named because the virus appears on
April 26, the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. CIH infected
as many as 600,000 computers in South Korea alone; damage estimates
run up to $10 million. Then, in June, came the Explore worm.
 &HT;    Technically, a worm is a program that crawls through networks,
automatically making and distributing copies of itself. (Viruses,
by contrast, need human help to propagate.) The Explore worm
appeared in a victim's E-mail in the guise of a note from a
correspondent. Attached to the note was a file: zipped_files .exe.
When recipients open the file, they see an error message and assume
nothing has happened.
 &HT;    In fact, the worm has effectively erased documents, spreadsheets
and presentations. In addition, the worm infects other machines on
the network, hitting even people who haven't recently used their
E-mail.
 &HT;    To the relief of security experts, no one has yet combined the
unbelievably rapid spread of Melissa (sending out 50 copies of
itself at once) and the toxic actions of the Explore worm (trashing
files). But it might not be long before someone does, and Schneier
believes that the results may be catastrophic.
 &HT;    ``It's a really big deal,'' he argued in a warning widely
distributed over the Internet. With cracking scripts posted on the
Web by their inventors, Schneier wrote, the new malware programs
``don't propagate over weeks and months; they propagate in
seconds.''
 &HT;    When a cracker can figure out a new way of attack in the morning
and spread it across the world in the afternoon, users cannot
possibly be protected by, say, updating their antiviral software
and security patches every week. (And how many users do even that?)
 &HT;    A new approach will be needed, Schneier believes. Society will
have to insist that security is built into software from the
beginning.
 &HT;    ``From a security point of view, the software in everyday use is
nonfunctional,'' says Rice University's Wallach. ``There's an old
joke. If cars were like computers, they would go 300 mph and get a
hundred miles to the gallon and cost $50. Except that twice a month
someone a thousand miles away would be able to blow up the car,
killing everyone nearby.'' Believing there is no cry for better
security, software vendors simply ignore the issue, he says.
 &HT;    Ultimately, Spafford thinks, all is not hopeless. A solution may
lie on the horizon: the Y2K problem. Like the asbestos lawyers
involved in the tobacco lawsuits, Y2K lawyers will start looking
for new targets.
 &HT;    They will discover that many of society's most valued assets
have been entrusted to badly designed and unsafe software. ``I tell
you,'' Spafford says, ``they won't be able to believe their good
fortune.''

 By CHARLES C. MANN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Ever since the news broke in March that the FBI discovered that
Wen Ho Lee, a researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory, had
filled one of his computers with top-secret files about
nuclear-weapons design, the lab has been vilified in Congress for
its lack of computer-system security.
 &HT;    But computer-security professionals have not joined the chorus.
 &HT;    For them, the Los Alamos case simply exemplifies the inherent
difficulty of controlling the flow of digital information _ not
just in laboratories, but anywhere.
 &HT;    The heart of these problems is that computer networks _ and the
Internet _ are extremely difficult to protect.
 &HT;    ``The only system that is truly secure is one that is switched
off and unplugged, locked in a titanium safe, buried in a concrete
vault on the bottom of the sea and surrounded by very highly paid
armed guards,'' says Eugene H. Spafford, director of the Purdue
Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and
Security. ``Even then I wouldn't bet on it.''
 &HT;    Computers can be secured better only if users accept Draconian
restrictions that make their systems much harder to use _ which, as
a rule, users refuse to do. Alas, the risks of willful ignorance
are growing.
 &HT;    Never have the methods of attack been so powerful and easy to
use. Never has the Internet made it possible to disseminate those
methods everywhere in minutes. And never have so many livelihoods _
and lives _ depended on systems so vulnerable to attack.
 &HT;    ``I can't say that 1999 will be the year when a blowup
happens,'' says A. Padgett Peterson, chief of information security
at Lockheed-Martin. ``But what I can say is that, compared to what
is possible, what we have seen so far has been almost benign in
nature.''
 &HT;    Roughly 8,000 researchers are scattered about the 43-square-mile
campus of Los Alamos. Each one has a computer. Many have more than
one. Almost all are wired, one way or another, into a laboratory
network. Additional thousands of administrators and support
personnel have access to computers. So do the 3,000 visitors who
work temporarily at the laboratory each year.
 &HT;    This year, 450 of the employees are foreign citizens, including
more than 30 from Russia, China, North Korea and seven other
``sensitive'' countries.
 &HT;    Keeping track of what these thousands of people are up to is
difficult, to say the least. Los Alamos' efforts to do so
illustrate both the difficulty of the task and why users so often
rebel against their own security measures.
 &HT;    Los Alamos _ like other facilities with classified work _ gave
scientists a ``black'' computer for their secret material and a
``white'' computer for contacting the outside world. Lee worked
with 300 other researchers in the weapon-design group, known
melodramatically as the ``X Division.'' All the researchers had
both machines chewing up real estate on their desks.
 &HT;    In theory, scientists are not supposed to copy work from one
machine to the other; in practice, the temptation is strong.
 &HT;    ``The military insists on reviewing all the software you put on
your black computer,'' says Jeffrey I. Schiller, network manager
for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a director of the
security group for the Internet Engineering Task Force, the ad hoc
international body that develops technical standards for the
Internet. Such a review process, invariably, is slow.
 &HT;    ``It guarantees that their systems are up to three years out of
date. You want to write a report with the latest version of
Microsoft Word on your insecure computer or on some piece of junk
with your secure computer?''
 &HT;    The superior usefulness of the unclassified systems, Schiller
speculates, may be why the former CIA chief John Deutch was caught
last year with top-secret files on his home computer.
 &HT;    ``People load up the classified stuff on their white computer,
then delete it,'' Schiller says. ``But you do that enough times,
you start to lose track.'' Eventually, the white machine becomes
gray.
 &HT;    Military installations try to contain classified data by
``air-gapping'' their networks. Recognizing that they cannot
control the flow of material within a network, they seek to fence
off the entire network _ maintaining a literal gap of air between
the computer and all connection to the outside world.
 &HT;    That is more easily said than done; computers can transmit
information in multiple ways.
 &HT;    To air-gap its computers, the National Security Agency not only
controls modems, floppy disks, Zip drives, optical disks, CD-ROMs
and Ethernet cards, it installs ``blacker boxes'' _ special devices
that prevent data from leaking out through the power cable.
 &HT;    That is not enough, says Simson Garfinkel, the author, with
Spafford, of ``Practical Unix and Internet Security.'' ``It's very
difficult to be sure data is ever actually taken off a hard
drive,'' Garfinkel says. ``You might think you could just wipe the
disk but that won't do it.''
 &HT;    He says the military used to safeguard data by grinding up old
disks. Now that doesn't work anymore. Tiny pieces of hard drives
can contain sizable amounts of information.
 &HT;    According to a rough calculation by Garfinkel, a
one-sixteenth-inch-square piece of a 6-gigabyte hard drive can hold
750,000 bytes _ enough for a 300-page book. ``A spy could remove a
hard disk, grind it up and smuggle out the data in little pieces
like pocket lint,'' he says.
 &HT;    Los Alamos has split off all machines with secret information
from all machines with access to the Internet, according to John

IN MEXICO, GENERATION X GETS LOUD: PROTESTS EXTEND FAR BEYOND
CAMPUS POLITICS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL RILEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ While members of Mexico's latest generation of
student revolutionaries are known to quote Karl Marx, they also
sport dreadlocks and are more likely than not to have some parts of
their bodies pierced.
</P>
<P>
   They flaunt hair colors that range from fluorescent marine-green
to a bold stripe of spray-paint red. Yet they see themselves in the
tradition of Cuba's Che Guevara or Mexico's Subcomandante Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a Hollywood script, it might be tagged ``Emilio
Zapata meets Generation X.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, among the thousands of idealistic students involved in
one of the biggest university protests here since the late 1960s,
many now believe that what started out as a fight over an increase
in tuition can be transformed into a left-wing movement that will
reach far beyond the confines of campus politics.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the rest of Mexico will go along is another question.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this is a social movement,'' said Ana Paula Lira, a
19-year-old dentistry student, as she stood guard at the gate of
one of the now-barricaded entrances to the vast Mexico City campus
of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, striking students have turned classrooms into
dormitories and kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Late into the night, they play chess and talk politics. During
the days, they hold protests, teach children's theater and modern
dance in their own open university, and try to convince commuters
on buses and the city's subway that there is something
fundamentally wrong with the direction Mexico is going on the cusp
of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't want to change the university _ what we want is
a social movement that will help the people,'' Lira said.
</P>
<P>
   The protest has shut down Latin America's largest university for
more than 3 months and forced most of its 276,000 students and
30,000 professors to go off campus for classes. Frustrated
university officials finally canceled the spring semester earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   But as a social movement, the strike has a particular problem:
Nobody, including the strikers, seems to know exactly what they
want.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, which initially drew
wide sympathy from the left and the country's urban poor, Mexican
society has an ambivalent relationship with its new
revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Polls suggest that the majority of Mexicans don't approve of the
strike. Talks between university officials and the students have
broken down repeatedly. Officials now say they will no longer even
sit down with the strike leaders until the students promise to
abandon the campus that they have occupied since April.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're only hurting themselves,'' said Maria Isabel Castro, a
76-year-old grandmother, as she tended a market stand in the city's
center. ``I say the ones who want to study should study and the
rest, throw them out in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, nearly everyone has been surprised by the determination
of the students and a capacity to organize that has repeatedly
brought supportive crowds of thousands into the capital's streets
and the university's main square.
</P>
<P>
   The strike appears to have tapped the frustration of a
generation that has grown up as Mexico has stumbled from one
economic crisis to another. Real wages have dropped dramatically
since the early 1980s, analysts say, and the inequality gap that
separates rich from poor has grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a moment when some sectors of society feel alienated,
and the youth are reacting to that,'' said Sergio Aguayo, a
political analyst. ``Forty to 50 percent of this country lives in
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why the strikers didn't stop June 7, when the
university's president gave in to their primary demand and withdrew
his proposal for a mandatory increase in fees from the current
equivalent of about 2 cents per semester _ effectively free _ to
about $150.
</P>
<P>
   The students had won, but they had also captured the public
pulpit and seemed unwilling to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   They have added several more demands, including a restructuring
of how the university is governed.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also clear from interviews with students and their
faculty supporters that many hope the strike can spark a nationwide
political movement that can connect with workers, primary and
secondary school teachers, and other universities _ invigorating
the country's left in a grand, grass-roots coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the engines of democratization in the country over the
last 30 years has been the public university. That's what you're
seeing now _ the university moving to recapture this national
role,'' said Carola Garcia Calderon, a professor of communication
in the faculty of political and social sciences, which has served
as the movement's nerve center.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not much agreement has emerged on what this larger movement
ought to be about. Recent protests have lashed out against targets
as varied as the World Bank, Mexico's stock market, the country's
news media, the United States and university entrance exams.
</P>

   ``They don't have a clear message, and the image that they are
projecting of themselves is quite radical,'' Aguayo said. ``In a
way, this is a nostalgic moment. They are trying to appeal to a
Mexico that no longer exists.''

   Most analysts say confused goals and apparent intransigence will
limit the students' capacity to expand their following. Internal
splits are already forming.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of brewing dissent, a sizable group of students
broke ranks July 18 over the issue of whether they should hand over
the campus to help restart negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the most significant thing about the students'
uprising may be that they can shut down a massive university, march
in the streets, hand ultimatums to government negotiators and,
through it all, give the authorities little choice but to stand by
and wait it out.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dramatic contrast to Mexico's leftist student movement of
1968 that ended when federal troops opened fire on the protesters
in a square, killing, by one estimate, nearly 200.
</P>
<P>
   Private papers of the general who was Mexico's secretary of
defense at the time were made public last month. The documents show
that members of the presidential bodyguard team fired on the
students and that the order came directly from the president,
Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, something long denied by successive
governments.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, such intervention would be hard to imagine in
a Mexico obsessed with its international image and securing a role
in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The army has said it will not intervene. Authorities have not
ruled out police action, but a recent poll in the daily Reforma
indicates that while public opinion does not support the strike, it
is also overwhelmingly against using force to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   With the most competitive presidential election in the country's
modern history shaping up for next year, observers say direct
intervention would present too much of a political risk for the
government of President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police aren't entering to retake the campus because no one
in the government is prepared to pay the consequences of even a
single student dying,'' said Denise Maerker, the host of a TV
interview program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineteen sixty-eight was another Mexico, another society
altogether.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    George W. Bush Jr. has raised the most money of any presidential
candidate in history: $36 million and counting. Much of it was
gathered by only 200 people, super-fund-raisers whom Bush has
dubbed ``Pioneers.''
 &HT;    Should Bush get elected president next year, it is not caviling
to say that those 200 people are more likely to get a phone call
through, and possibly even get a favor returned, than, say, I will.
 &HT;    So who are these very special people? Bush's campaign advisers
have decided it is not in our interest to know, and there is no
legal means to compel them to tell.
 &HT;    Outrageous?
 &HT;    Well, is it any more upsetting than Al Gore's notorious visit to
the Buddhist temple? Or the afternoon in 1995 when Rep. John
Boehner of Ohio, the GOP Conference chairman, was spotted on the
House floor cheerfully tossing out checks from tobacco lobbyists
like daisies? How about when Trent Lott and Bill Clinton conspired
in a fit of midnight fraternity to sneak through a $50 billion tax
loophole for the tobacco companies?
 &HT;    Does anyone disagree that our campaign-finance system has lapsed
into legalized corruption?
 &HT;    For closeted campaign-finance wonks like myself, the real news
every presidential election is not who is running but what fresh
scheme has been devised by the high-finance shamans to exploit the
newest loophole.
 &HT;    This year's twist: George W.'s $36 million is composed of direct
contributions to his campaign, or ``hard money.'' The focus of
reformers over the last few election cycles, of course, has been
``soft money'' _ contributions to the national party, which comes
into play only after party nominations are official.
 &HT;    The McCain-Feingold bill, which is likely to be forced onto the
Senate by John McCain, another Republican presidential candidate,
in the next few weeks, deals almost exclusively with soft money.
Why? Because Clinton's scheme in the last two elections was to
artfully co-opt the soft-money coffers of the Democratic National
Committee to his own use.
 &HT;    (Today, for example, the national chairman of the DNC is Steven
Grossman, a man, in all likelihood, you have never heard of. But
he's a very good friend of Gore's. Coincidence?)
 &HT;    Every poll taken reveals that voters strongly favor reform. But
when pressed for details of what might work, folks appear
overwhelmed by the complexity. It seems like some public policy
Rubik's cube for think-tank nerds to solve, with all that talk of
spending caps, soft-money restrictions, limits on political action
committees and Federal Election Commission reporting requirements.
Even most expert commentary is little more than frustration
venting.
 &HT;    In a recent Op-Ed article, George McGovern lamented the
``vexing'' problem of ``big money in politics. Thoughtful members
of both parties are stymied by this issue.''
 &HT;    What everyone seems to agree on, and has for decades, is that
the problem boils down to ``too much money'' and the solution
unquestionably involves ``restrictions'' and ``fuller disclosure.''
 &HT;    Actually, not everyone agrees about this. There are other
would-be reformers out there who describe the problem differently.
To see the world their way is to see the limitations of fixes
inspired by conventional wisdom. And to see how a radically
different solution might not only solve our predicament quite
elegantly but also profoundly change the way elections are
conducted in the process.
 &HT;    The current crop of labored patches to the system _ such as the
McCain-Feingold bill and its bouquet of technical fixes - is trying
to end-run a 23-year-old Supreme Court decision that reasonably
warned reformers that the voters' right to give money to candidates
is inextricably bound up with the voters' right to free speech,
expression and peaceable assembly.
 &HT;    The brain teaser is this: How do you allow voters to freely
donate money to the candidates and parties without permitting the
easy money of special interests to crowd the rest of us out? Or,
vice versa, how do you restrict the special interests without
hobbling the necessary expression of voters in a robust election?
 &HT;    The official big fix that Beltway reformers are at least willing
to acknowledge is ``clean money,'' or public financing, which
solves the riddle by asking candidates to voluntarily forgo all
donated money in exchange for a stream of revenue from the state.
 &HT;    Again, it is fundamentally about limiting money. The proposal
has some support in cozy small-d democratic states like Maine and
Vermont, liberal Massachusetts and the libertarian outpost of
Arizona. But government-financed elections are unlikely to find
much of a reception in states as heterogeneous as New York or as
angry as South Carolina.
 &HT;    One night not long ago, at dinner in New Haven, I met Prof.
Bruce Ackerman of Yale, who has a provocative plan indeed: He
proposes to create a dedicated form of election currency and
positively flood the system with it.
 &HT;    At election time, every registered voter would receive, say, 100
``patriot dollars'' via a digital credit card. The voters could
donate this money any way they saw fit _ to a party, a union, to
Tom DeLay's PAC or to People for the American Way. While the last
presidential election cost roughly $400 million, Patriot dollars
would marginalize all greenbacks by sluicing $13 billion into the
system.
 &HT;    Since the viable candidates could get money only directly from
voters, voters are who they'd have to campaign to. Patriot dollars
bring to fund-raising the equality inherent in voting. One man, one
vote? One vote, a hundred bucks.
 &HT;    This has its charms, but does seem a little unwieldy. Then, at
another dinner, I learned that a friend had a plan that shares one
of the assumptions of Ackerman's scheme _ that limiting money is
the wrong way to go.
 &HT;    Prof. Ian Ayres of Yale and a co-author, Jeremy Bulow of
Stanford, have published a law-review article detailing their idea
to allow anybody or any institution to give as much campaign money
as they want. But with one key proviso: The candidate cannot find
out who the donors are.
 &HT;    All campaign donations would be funneled through a blind trust.
The candidate still gets the money. He just can't know to whom he
owes, or doesn't owe, a favor. Anyone could claim to be a donor
with the same impunity that each of us can safely claim to have
``voted'' for the politician.
 &HT;    This idea questions reform's most basic assumption - that more
and fuller disclosure is the only answer. ``Instead of limiting
money,'' the authors write, ``we might limit information.''
 &HT;    The constitutionality of such a plan would be difficult to
question. It is modeled on something seemingly more fundamental
than even free-speech concerns: the secret ballot. Just as a voter
goes into a booth and votes secretly, the donor would go into what
the authors call, metaphorically, a ``donation booth'' and donate.
In both cases, the voters know for whom they voted (donated to),
but the candidates do not.
 &HT;    The Supreme Court would be hard pressed to explain why a secret
ballot is constitutional and a secret donation is not. And
politicians would be equally challenged to come up with a
convincing answer to this question: Why do you need to know the
identity of your donors?
 &HT;    It turns out the secret ballot was invented for the precise
reason the authors suggest the donation booth. In the 19th century,
voting in America was shockingly corrupt.
 &HT;    Party bosses organized voters and drove them to the voting
stations like cattle. The ballots for opposing candidates were
published on different colored paper. The bosses typically checked
on their vote-buying by forcing voters into single-file lines and
demanding that they physically wave their paid-for ballots over
their heads.
 &HT;    This practice came to an end when the ``Australian ballot'' _
the secret ballot was invented there _ came to America.
Massachusetts was the first state to adopt the secret ballot, in
1888. South Carolina was the last ... in 1950.
 &HT;    By and large, the secret ballot pretty much eliminated
vote-buying; perhaps a donation booth would have a similar effect.
It neatly solves the PAC problem, which is a dark mutation of
mandatory disclosure.
 &HT;    Today, the PAC can ``bundle'' bags of legal checks for the
candidates and explain precisely where they came from. With
donation booths, PACs would wither. So, perhaps, would a lot of
campaign contributions.
 &HT;    After the secret ballot went into effect, voting dropped off
nearly 7 percent. The authors themselves worry that their reform
would ``shift money toward less accountable 'issue advocacy'
expenditures and may be so effective in disrupting the market for
influence that it cripples candidates' ability to raise funds.''
 &HT;    Just how far you think donations might plunge is almost a
Rorschach test of how deeply corrupt you believe the system to be.
I don't know about you, but I am comforted by the fact that voting
fell only 7 percent.
 &HT;    Would donations dip only a bit, suggesting that most
contributors want little more than the election of a generally
like-minded individual? Or would they crash, revealing that donors
want specific quid for quo, or nothing? Either outcome of the
donation booth would be radical, in the sense that it would
completely upend the system we currently have in place. But would
anyone really miss it?
 &HT;    Perhaps the candidates would just become shuttlecocks battered
amid a riot of citizen-financed issue ads. Would that be so bad?
 &HT;    And if candidates could not afford to saturate television with
either feel-good commercials Vaselined with slo-mo family values or
with negative ads predicting moral decay in stentorian voice-over,
perhaps they would have to work the streets for votes and fashion
clever speeches to attract free media exposure.
 &HT;    It would be utopian to think that any of these solutions would
restore us to some Jeffersonian democracy of high-minded yeomen.
(That never existed anyway.) But now we tolerate a system in which
we routinely hear stories about, say, the presence of corporate
campaign donors at congressional staff meetings to draw up new
environmental laws.
 &HT;    In a truly transformed system, it just might be that our
politicians would, from time to time, find themselves contemplating
the affairs of their voters as a coherent whole instead of the
concerns of their most generous fund-raisers. Imagine that.

TINY TEXAS TOWN MAKES A BIG SPLASH

<P>
   SHERIDAN, Texas _ Sometimes, a town's water tower just doesn't
quite say it all. In Sheridan, population 225, it says: ``Deer
Hunting Capital.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of place where there's no cop because you
rarely need one, where anybody you'd want to find is probably down
at the Dairy D Lite, and where, at least one day last week, two
dogs sunning themselves in the middle of West First Street couldn't
be bothered to get out of the way of a passing car.
</P>
<P>
   There's no movie theater here, no grocery store, no high school.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, this isn't even a town.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nearly every day this summer, hundreds of people have been
flocking to this unincorporated Colorado County hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   And they aren't here to hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The big draw this summer, and half of last, is Splashway Family
Waterpark, a four-acre park containing water slides called
Hurricane Hill and The Python, a wave pool, a volleyball court and
a winding ``river.''
</P>
<P>
   Built along Highway 90A, next to a cattle pasture, on the
grounds of a former junkyard, Splashway is proof of what a tiny
town can do when it starts out to fix a crack in the local swimming
pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a can-do community,'' Wayne Dupre, a retired oil
company worker and Sheridan booster, explained recently as he stood
on the water park bridge he built himself. ``We have a volunteer
water system, a volunteer fire department and ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see our pavilion? All volunteer,'' he added. ``See
this rope?'' he said, pointing to a huge white braid that lines the
sidewalk to the ``beach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy who works on an oil rig brought that in. They have to
pay someone to haul that away. He told them, `Put it in my truck. I
know a place that could use it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, what ever made these people think they could lure water
park enthusiasts off of Interstate 10 between Houston's Splash Town
and Waterworld, and San Antonio's Six Flags Fiesta Texas? What made
them believe their little water park could compete with the
Schlitterbahn in New Braunfels, even if it is half the price?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we're doing it,'' said Carolyn Brisco. She and her
husband, Jim, spearheaded the campaign that won a $415,000 grant
from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to build the park and
formed a nonprofit corporation of community volunteers to get it up
and running.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming from all over Texas, from as far away as
Dallas and the Louisiana border,'' she said. ``We're exceeding our
projections for attendance and entry fees. We employ about 70
people. And the kids love it.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing started several years ago, when residents were
trying to come up with a plan to replace the town's aging swimming
pool, which had become a financial drain on the community and was
cracked beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brisco, a Sheridan native who moved his family back home
after more than a dozen years as an Alaskan fisherman, inquired
about getting a recreation grant. Building a full-fledged water
park instead of a regular swimming pool, he discovered, could be
financially feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Parks and Wildlife officials were all for it. They awarded the
group a grant under a program that usually provides money for
community pools or baseball diamonds. The funds come from the state
sales tax on sporting goods.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan residents held fish fries and took donations. The Lower
Colorado River Authority, a state agency that manages water
resources and electricity, chipped in $125,000 toward other
improvements in what is now a $1 million, 18-acre recreational
complex that includes a Little League field, picnic and camping
areas and a community playground.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the money, though, discussions in Sheridan brought a
wave of detractors determined to pull the plug on the whole deal.
</P>
<P>
   Letters were written. Names were called. And a petition drive
pushed by Betty Layton, a local gift shop owner, and her daughter,
Sharon, drew 134 signatures against Splashway.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction would bring undesirables into the quiet
retirement community, they argued. It would be noisy. Think of the
traffic. We have no police protection, they said. And even if the
park succeeded in bringing in enough visitors from the outside,
they complained, who in town could afford to shell out water park
admission prices?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're too far out in the sticks,'' Betty Layton said last
week. ``Sure, people will come one time and then what happens? Are
you going to pay $9 every time you want to take your kid swimming?
Our point was, fix the swimming pool and take your kids swimming
every day for a buck. They wouldn't listen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They called Jim the Pied Piper, said he was leading everyone
astray,'' Carolyn Brisco said, laughing. How did the hometown boy,
the town's first Eagle Scout, react? ``He bought himself a pipe,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dupre dismissed the naysayers. About 15 percent of the town was
against the park originally, he said, ``but some people complain
about any change you want to make. You could take a vote to get
Jesus Christ to come here and they'd vote against it.''

 By RICHARD PANEK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The group of graduate students had gathered, as groups of
graduate students do at such affairs, off to one side of the hall.
The occasion was a symposium at the Space Telescope Science
Institute at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore. The graduate
students were eyeing their elders and chatting nervously about the
many major figures in cosmology in the room.
 &HT;    One student made the inevitable joke about a bomb going off and
what that would do to their field of study. Everybody laughed.
 &HT;    ``But at least it would open up some jobs,'' said another. More
laughter.
 &HT;    ``And the first bomb can strike right there,'' said a third,
nodding toward a portly, elderly man standing not five yards away.
The group grew quiet.
 &HT;    In a way, they would get their wish.
 &HT;    This past May 25, NASA held a press conference in Washington to
announce that the search for the Holy Grail of cosmology was over.
A research team calling itself the Hubble Space Telescope Key
Project was claiming it had solved one of the original mysteries of
civilization, the age of the universe.
 &HT;    If correct, the result meant that Allan Sandage, the target of
the young cosmologist's imaginary bomb, was worse than wrong. It
threatened to render him irrelevant.
 &HT;    For nearly 50 years, Sandage had been laboring to complete the
effort of his mentor, Edwin Hubble, to find a figure that
astronomers now call the Hubble constant _ the rate of expansion of
the universe and, by implication, its age. Sandage himself long ago
came up with an answer.
 &HT;    Then he came up with it again, and then again, and again and
again. Now rival astronomers were claiming that they had divined
not an answer but the answer _ and it wasn't the same as Sandage's.
 &HT;    ``It's a disaster for me,'' Sandage said just after the
announcement. ``It's a psychological disaster. I mean, you just
can't imagine what the last two weeks have been like. But if you
permit it, the world will either break your heart or turn your
heart to stone.''
 &HT;    The Key Project had arrived at a constant of 70 plus or minus 10
percent (the expansion rate expressed in kilometers per second per
megaparsec), which put the age of the universe at 12 billion years,
while Sandage's most recent result was 58 plus or minus 10 percent,
or an age of 15 billion years.
 &HT;    To outsiders, a difference between 12 billion and 15 billion
years might seem cosmically (if not comically) insignificant _
indeed the error margins overlapped, if only just barely, somewhere
around a Hubble constant of 63 and an age of 13.5 billion years.
 &HT;    At long last, some Key Project astronomers suggested, the time
had come for the two sides in the ``Hubble wars'' to compromise.
 &HT;    For Sandage, however, science has never been about compromise;
it's about right and wrong _ the certainty of absolutes, not the
convenience of a politically expedient solution. For his rivals,
science isn't necessarily about compromise either. But neither is
it about what many have long thought they'd detected in Sandage:
obstinacy to the point of arrogance, arrogance to the point of
impeding progress.
 &HT;    As one graduate student at the Johns Hopkins symposium remarked,
glaring at Sandage in exasperation, ''Every time you see a graph of
results on the Hubble constant, there's everyone else, getting
closer together, and there's his 55, 55, 55.''
 &HT;    And that, for cosmology at the close of the century that
witnessed its birth as a science, was precisely the problem. There
was everybody else, and there was Sandage, and the universe wasn't
big enough for the both of them.
 &HT;    As it happens, Sandage is older than the universe, or at least
our current conception of it. An only child whose father was an
academic, Sandage was born in Iowa City, Iowa, in 1926. That was
three years before Hubble observed that the billions of galaxies
out there appear to be racing away from us, and the farther away
they are, the faster they're receding. In other words, that the
universe is expanding.
 &HT;    What Darwin had done for our species and Wegener had done for
our planet, Hubble had now done for the cosmos _ recast it as an
organism evolving over time. The universe had a story to tell, and
all you had to do was look.
 &HT;    So Hubble looked, and when he couldn't anymore, Sandage looked
for him.
 &HT;    Back in the early 1950s, Sandage might have figured it would
take 15 years or so to complete Hubble's program. Now, at 73, he's
still pursuing it. Which would be OK _ that's the way science goes
sometimes, after all _ if it weren't for these other astronomers
trying to overturn a substantial portion of his life's work.
 &HT;    Again and again during an afternoon in Pasadena three days after
the Key Project news conference, he insists he doesn't want to talk
about the Hubble constant; again and again he returns to it.
 &HT;    ``They're slowly educating themselves. They started at 115, then
went down to 100, then to 90, then 80, then 73, now 70. And when
will the thing be solved? When the other group gets our number and
claims it to be a new discovery.''
 &HT;    Then he makes a face of disgust. This isn't the way he wanted to
go out _ a figure of pity, with a controversy as his legacy.
 &HT;    Sandage is aware of his reputation among the younger generation.
 &HT;    ``'Allan is a grumpy old man,''' he offers, laughing. He won't
use voice or E-mail, and insists on driving a stick shift because
``it's just unbelievably boring to drive an automatic.''
 &HT;    When astronomers started looking to computer screens for data in
the late 1980s, Sandage knew it was time to quit. The era of the
lone observer, staring into the abyss, was gone.
 &HT;    ``The changeover to the modern world!'' he laments. ``If I were
15 years younger, I could have competed with these guys.''
 &HT;    He's standing in the attic of the legendary building on Santa
Barbara Street in Pasadena that has served as headquarters for the
Carnegie Institution's observatories since the 1920s.
 &HT;    Sandage has lost some sight in his right eye, the one he pressed
to an eyepiece for nearly half a century, and his sense of balance
is off, a hazard on an observing platform dozens of feet off a
concrete floor. Still, he works every day. He has years of
astronomical data to reduce, he says, decades of memories to put
down and a century's worth of archives that he would maybe like
``to get into some kind of shape.''
 &HT;    Then again, maybe not. He looks at the cabinets full of
photographic plates and daily logs and all the other data that
nowadays pass directly from the night sky into the digital ether.
 &HT;    ``Records like this no longer exist,'' he sighs, almost to
himself. ``I have no idea why we keep them.''
 &HT;    Sandage may be the last surviving link to Hubble. As a boy, he
read everything he could about the radically new vision of the
universe then emerging.
 &HT;    At 15, Sandage made a pilgrimage with his father to the Mount
Wilson Observatory, where Hubble was working his miracles. In 1948,
he returned, this time as a student at California Institute of
Technology in nearby Pasadena. Over the next four years Sandage
advanced from apprentice to assistant to Hubble's heir.
 &HT;    ``I came at exactly the right time,'' Sandage says. ``I was 26
years old, and all the monks and priests down here were ready to
retire. So I overlapped enough that I got to know them all.''
 &HT;    Up there, on the mountaintop, Sandage could dwell among his
gods, astronomers who knew they'd ``arrived,'' as Sandage puts it,
when they found their napkin not clipped to a clothespin but tucked
inside a wooden ring inscribed with their name. And down here, on
Santa Barbara Street, Sandage could inspect for himself ``the
plates of Moses'' _ the vast archives of photographic records, and
an apt metaphor in more ways than one.
 &HT;    Like Moses, Hubble had come down from the mountain bearing new
laws of nature. But also like Moses, Hubble had to wander the
proverbial desert for decades, only to die within sight of the
Promised Land.
 &HT;    Hubble suffered a major heart attack in the summer of 1949, at
the age of 60, just six months after making his initial
observations with the 200-inch-diameter mirror in the new telescope
on Mount Palomar outside San Diego _ an instrument that he'd been
eagerly awaiting since the late 1920s, the one that he hoped would
allow him to determine the age and structure of the universe.
 &HT;    In 1953, Hubble died. To his assistant fell the responsibility
for executing one of the most ambitious scientific programs in
history.
 &HT;    While finishing Hubble's work, Sandage also pursued his own
first love, how stars evolve. In 1960, he and a young radio
astronomer named Thomas Matthews identified something altogether
new and unforeseen and confounding, the first ``radio star.''
 &HT;    The discovery created quite a stir _ though not so great as the
finding three years later by other astronomers that the source of
the signal wasn't a star within our galaxy, as Sandage and Thomas
had assumed it to be, but something else 1.5 billion light-years
away, earning it the name quasi-stellar radio source, or
``quasar.''
 &HT;    The universe was getting curiouser and curiouser, but in their
rush to publish, Sandage's peers didn't always give credit where it
was due.
 &HT;    ``Tom Matthews and I were the discoverers of quasars,'' Sandage
says, the anger still evident. ``The quasars were stolen from both
of us.''
 &HT;    That episode altered forever the way he thought about his
profession. ``It's not
oh-we're-all-in-this-together-just-seeking-the-
secrets-of-nature,'' he says. ``The competition between colleagues
is really much stronger than anybody on the outside understands.''
 &HT;    As for Wendy Freedman, a Key Project leader, Sandage is blunt in
assessing a motive: ``fame.''
 &HT;    The first woman to join the permanent staff on Santa Barbara
Street, in 1987, Freedman belongs to a new generation of
astronomers. For them, a space telescope simply represented a
chance to take on one of the fundamental controversies in
cosmology.
 &HT;    ``There are some problems you work at and you work at, and you
can't really make progress,'' Freedman says, ''but this was an area
where there was an opportunity with Hubble to do something where
there was an impasse on the ground.''
 &HT;    The new generation, not surprisingly, isn't charmed by Sandage's
``Uncle Allan'' routine _ the hoots and howls, the chortles and
chuckles, the guffaws and wheezes and other explosions of seeming
enthusiasm that exhaust the thesaurus listing for ``laughs.''
 &HT;    He can be avuncular, all right _ with a vengeance. ``The answer
will come,'' he once announced about his rivals' efforts, ``when
responsible people go to the telescope.''
 &HT;    Over the years Sandage and Freedman have virtually stopped
speaking to each other. Freedman's summary of her differences with
Sandage is crisply professional: ''I have the utmost respect for
him. We just have a scientific disagreement. That's how science
proceeds.''
 &HT;    But that's not the only way science proceeds, Sandage says. For
him, his rivals' efforts resemble nothing so much as the Darwinian
struggle that he has observed in the stars and galaxies.
 &HT;    ``When I came in there were only 15 observational cosmologists
in the world,'' Sandage says. Astronomers in 1950 numbered maybe
2,000. Now, Sandage estimates, that total is as high as 15,000.
``The survival instinct is very, very crucial, especially now among
the young people. And the desire for media attention can be
overwhelming.''
 &HT;    It can raise the stakes; it can lower the error bar. It can push
programs, methodologies, results, even interpretations of
ostensibly objective data _ supposedly in the name of science, but
also for the sake of tenure, appointments, observing time,
financing. And in this habitat, what's one half-blind, off-balance,
retired astronomer more or less?
 &HT;    In the aftermath of the quasar controversy, in the late 1960s,
Sandage removed himself from public view. He continued working with
his longtime collaborator Gustav Tammann, continued publishing new
values for the Hubble constant (nearly always in the 50-to-55
range), but he stopped attending even astronomical conferences.
 &HT;    In 1983, he re-emerged suddenly at a meeting in Vancouver.
During his absence, according to ``Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos,''
by Dennis Overbye, he became a born-again Christian, a subject he
now won't discuss explicitly. But he will say that he struggled
with how to separate his needs from the needs of science.
 &HT;    To talk about the Hubble-constant controversy is to violate his
personal code; yet not to defend his research is to violate his
professional code. He is nearly keening with the conflict.
 &HT;    ``I really am very, very unhappy with this controversy getting
into the press,'' he says, his face falling. But in the end, it's
another, not entirely charitable, thought that seems to rally his
spirits: ``The very fact that every article I know of has indicated
that we do exist and have a different answer _ the opposition did
not expect that.''
 &HT;    Indeed, at a meeting in a Chicago hotel where members of the
Hubble Key Project team assembled to explain their results before
several hundred colleagues, it seems an astronomer from another
observatory arrived at a value of the Hubble constant using a new,
improved methodology. And guess what? It differs from the Key
Project's _ by 15 percent to 20 percent.
 &HT;    Which leaves Sandage precisely where he has been since he packed
up his eyepiece, pocketed his napkin ring and came down from the
mountain: as low as 50, as high as 58, call it 55. It's in the
literature that he'll endure, or not; either way, it's in the
literature that he lives.
 &HT;    ``The library is my telescope now,'' he says. ``If a day goes by
that I have not done something to prepare something for
publication, I believe that day is wasted.'' He is embarking on a
``proper history'' of the Mount Wilson Observatory _ after all, he
knows where the bodies are buried, literally.
 &HT;    Just outside the 100-inch, Sandage points out a plaque in the
grass that marks the final resting place for the ashes of an
astronomer. The summit would make a fitting end for Sandage, too:
blindingly white domes against achingly blue skies, sights so pure
they hurt. Has he considered such an arrangement for himself?
 &HT;    ``But I'm not going to die,'' he says. ``I'm going to live
forever!'' He's just going to have to get himself some of this
genetic engineering that prevents cells from growing old. ``My real
goal,'' he explains, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial growl,
``is to outlive my critics.''
 &HT;    And then he looses a shriek of glee into the thin mountain air.
More than ever, it is the sound of a man who fully intends the last
laugh to be his.

 &HT;    At 15, Sandage made a pilgrimage with his father to the Mount
Wilson Observatory, where Hubble was working his miracles. In 1948,
he returned, this time as a student at California Institute of
Technology in nearby Pasadena. Over the next four years Sandage
advanced from apprentice to assistant to Hubble's heir.
 &HT;    ``I came at exactly the right time,'' Sandage says. ``I was 26
years old, and all the monks and priests down here were ready to
retire. So I overlapped enough that I got to know them all.''
 &HT;    Up there, on the mountaintop, Sandage could dwell among his
gods, astronomers who knew they'd ``arrived,'' as Sandage puts it,
when they found their napkin not clipped to a clothespin but tucked
inside a wooden ring inscribed with their name. And down here, on
Santa Barbara Street, Sandage could inspect for himself ``the
plates of Moses'' _ the vast archives of photographic records, and
an apt metaphor in more ways than one.
 &HT;    Like Moses, Hubble had come down from the mountain bearing new
laws of nature. But also like Moses, Hubble had to wander the
proverbial desert for decades, only to die within sight of the
Promised Land.
 &HT;    Hubble suffered a major heart attack in the summer of 1949, at
the age of 60, just six months after making his initial
observations with the 200-inch-diameter mirror in the new telescope
on Mount Palomar outside San Diego _ an instrument that he'd been
eagerly awaiting since the late 1920s, the one that he hoped would
allow him to determine the age and structure of the universe.
 &HT;    In 1953, Hubble died. To his assistant fell the responsibility
for executing one of the most ambitious scientific programs in
history.
 &HT;    While finishing Hubble's work, Sandage also pursued his own
first love, how stars evolve. In 1960, he and a young radio
astronomer named Thomas Matthews identified something altogether
new and unforeseen and confounding, the first ``radio star.''
 &HT;    The discovery created quite a stir _ though not so great as the
finding three years later by other astronomers that the source of
the signal wasn't a star within our galaxy, as Sandage and Thomas
had assumed it to be, but something else 1.5 billion light-years
away, earning it the name quasi-stellar radio source, or
``quasar.''
 &HT;    The universe was getting curiouser and curiouser, but in their
rush to publish, Sandage's peers didn't always give credit where it
was due.
 &HT;    ``Tom Matthews and I were the discoverers of quasars,'' Sandage
says, the anger still evident. ``The quasars were stolen from both
of us.''
 &HT;    That episode altered forever the way he thought about his
profession. ``It's not
oh-we're-all-in-this-together-just-seeking-the-
secrets-of-nature,'' he says. ``The competition between colleagues
is really much stronger than anybody on the outside understands.''
 &HT;    As for Wendy Freedman, a Key Project leader, Sandage is blunt in
assessing a motive: ``fame.''
 &HT;    The first woman to join the permanent staff on Santa Barbara
Street, in 1987, Freedman belongs to a new generation of
astronomers. For them, a space telescope simply represented a
chance to take on one of the fundamental controversies in
cosmology.
 &HT;    ``There are some problems you work at and you work at, and you
can't really make progress,'' Freedman says, ''but this was an area
where there was an opportunity with Hubble to do something where
there was an impasse on the ground.''
 &HT;    The new generation, not surprisingly, isn't charmed by Sandage's
``Uncle Allan'' routine _ the hoots and howls, the chortles and
chuckles, the guffaws and wheezes and other explosions of seeming
enthusiasm that exhaust the thesaurus listing for ``laughs.''
 &HT;    He can be avuncular, all right _ with a vengeance. ``The answer
will come,'' he once announced about his rivals' efforts, ``when
responsible people go to the telescope.''
 &HT;    Over the years Sandage and Freedman have virtually stopped
speaking to each other. Freedman's summary of her differences with
Sandage is crisply professional: ''I have the utmost respect for
him. We just have a scientific disagreement. That's how science
proceeds.''
 &HT;    But that's not the only way science proceeds, Sandage says. For
him, his rivals' efforts resemble nothing so much as the Darwinian
struggle that he has observed in the stars and galaxies.
 &HT;    ``When I came in there were only 15 observational cosmologists
in the world,'' Sandage says. Astronomers in 1950 numbered maybe
2,000. Now, Sandage estimates, that total is as high as 15,000.
``The survival instinct is very, very crucial, especially now among
the young people. And the desire for media attention can be
overwhelming.''
 &HT;    It can raise the stakes; it can lower the error bar. It can push
programs, methodologies, results, even interpretations of
ostensibly objective data _ supposedly in the name of science, but
also for the sake of tenure, appointments, observing time,
financing. And in this habitat, what's one half-blind, off-balance,
retired astronomer more or less?
 &HT;    In the aftermath of the quasar controversy, in the late 1960s,
Sandage removed himself from public view. He continued working with
his longtime collaborator Gustav Tammann, continued publishing new
values for the Hubble constant (nearly always in the 50-to-55
range), but he stopped attending even astronomical conferences.
 &HT;    In 1983, he re-emerged suddenly at a meeting in Vancouver.
During his absence, according to ``Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos,''
by Dennis Overbye, he became a born-again Christian, a subject he
now won't discuss explicitly. But he will say that he struggled
with how to separate his needs from the needs of science.
 &HT;    To talk about the Hubble-constant controversy is to violate his
personal code; yet not to defend his research is to violate his
professional code. He is nearly keening with the conflict.
 &HT;    ``I really am very, very unhappy with this controversy getting
into the press,'' he says, his face falling. But in the end, it's
another, not entirely charitable, thought that seems to rally his
spirits: ``The very fact that every article I know of has indicated
that we do exist and have a different answer _ the opposition did
not expect that.''
 &HT;    Indeed, at a meeting in a Chicago hotel where members of the
Hubble Key Project team assembled to explain their results before
several hundred colleagues, it seems an astronomer from another
observatory arrived at a value of the Hubble constant using a new,
improved methodology. And guess what? It differs from the Key
Project's _ by 15 percent to 20 percent.
 &HT;    Which leaves Sandage precisely where he has been since he packed
up his eyepiece, pocketed his napkin ring and came down from the
mountain: as low as 50, as high as 58, call it 55. It's in the
literature that he'll endure, or not; either way, it's in the
literature that he lives.
 &HT;    ``The library is my telescope now,'' he says. ``If a day goes by
that I have not done something to prepare something for
publication, I believe that day is wasted.'' He is embarking on a
``proper history'' of the Mount Wilson Observatory _ after all, he
knows where the bodies are buried, literally.
 &HT;    Just outside the 100-inch, Sandage points out a plaque in the
grass that marks the final resting place for the ashes of an
astronomer. The summit would make a fitting end for Sandage, too:
blindingly white domes against achingly blue skies, sights so pure
they hurt. Has he considered such an arrangement for himself?
 &HT;    ``But I'm not going to die,'' he says. ``I'm going to live
forever!'' He's just going to have to get himself some of this
genetic engineering that prevents cells from growing old. ``My real
goal,'' he explains, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial growl,
``is to outlive my critics.''
 &HT;    And then he looses a shriek of glee into the thin mountain air.
More than ever, it is the sound of a man who fully intends the last
laugh to be his.

SHERIDAN, Texas: vote against it.`` 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But as residents learned more about the park plan, the volunteer
corps grew. People began hauling trash away from the proposed
building site. They showed up with shovels to work on the
landscaping. A group of senior citizens promised to keep everything
watered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let it be known that we wanted banana trees and I mean,
bananas started appearing,'' Carolyn Brisco said. ``One man dug up
a bunch of plants from his yard, wrapped them all in paper and tied
string around them, carried them over here like they were babies.''
</P>
<P>
   A local artist teamed up with Carolyn Brisco to design and paint
sea murals on the wave pool walls. Other volunteers worked on a
First Aid station, a gift shop and a concession stand. When a
tornado touched down near the town, leaving pastures and the local
cemetery littered with fallen trees, residents dragged them over to
the park to serve as supports for a shaded picnic area.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were still skeptical, though,'' Carolyn Brisco said.
``They'd drive by here when we were putting the trees up, and
they're all stripped of leaves, and people would call out, `Those
aren't gonna grow there, you know.' Of course we knew. We'd
cemented them into the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   In late June of last year, Splashway's organizers spread the
word with a few ads in area newspapers. The park was ready.
Admission would be based on height: $9 for those taller than 42
inches; $7 for those shorter. Kids under 32 inches get in free.
Park for nothing. Eat at the concession stand, or bring your own
picnic in a cooler.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of Splashway's first short season, 25,000 visitors
had tried it out. Over the winter, the volunteers returned to touch
up the paint, clean and plant.
</P>
<P>
   This season, there are 100 visitors some days; more than 600
other days. The biggest day so far drew 1,200 people. Capacity is
2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The park, which is completely accessible to the disabled, has
provided a place for field trips and parties for area schools,
church youth groups and 4-H clubs. A radio station and Coca-Cola
recently sponsored a teen night of music, swimming and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Kutach of Yoakum first visited the park as a sponsor to
her daughter Sloane's fourth-grade field trip in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun. It's clean. It's small. It's safe,'' she said. ``You
don't have to deal with traffic. You don't have to pay to park.
You're not scared you're going to lose anybody. We went to
Schlitterbahn and we had to wait in line sometimes 30 or 40
minutes. Here, there were 1,200 kids and the longest we waited was
7 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   She and 10-year-old Sloane returned recently, this time with
Kutach's 5-year-old grandson, Cody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're smaller. That's our appeal, especially for people with
young children,'' Carolyn Brisco said. ``You can see from one side
to the other, and if you lose sight of anybody, we have 14
lifeguards on duty watching them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids like Sloane Kutach enjoy the slides and the Criss-Cross
Canal, which requires some skill to use an overhead rope for
balance while walking across floating tires and a big log. But the
most popular feature is the 3 1/2-foot-deep Mystery River, which
starts in the wave pool and allows visitors to relax on bright
yellow and blue inner tubes and float through the park in a winding
circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about bobbing that just soothes the soul,''
said Carolyn Brisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main topic of conversation in the river is gossip,'' added
Dupre. ``People just get in those tubes and hook themselves
together with their toes and float and talk.''
</P>
<P>
   And while some visitors balk at the admission fees, many local
residents, especially children, volunteered to pick up trash and
pull weeds to get the park ready for the summer, earning free
season passes. Adults who want to just walk the Mystery River for
exercise can do so for free before and after the park's regular
hours of 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We especially encourage our senior citizens to come,'' Carolyn
Brisco said. ``Sometimes they don't like to come when there are a
bunch of kids splashing around and making a lot of noise, so they
can come before or after. It's good exercise and gets them out into
the community. Some people who've had knee or hip surgery come and
walk in the water. It's great therapy.''  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Splashway not only gave locals somewhere to go, it also gave
them somewhere to work. Last year, the park's lifeguards were
commended for their safety practices. The award letter from
International Aquatic Safety Consultants is posted at the Dairy D
Lite, right next to the ``Hot check writers beware'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the local convenience store across the highway from the
park advertises, ``Get all your Splashway supplies here.'' Some
people who signed the petition against the park now bring their
children to swim. Some of their teen-agers are lifeguards and
concession stand workers. And Dupre said the community's wounds are
healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the park a success? Yes. Did it come at a price? Yes,'' he
said. ``But it's kind of like getting a whole carload of people to
go to the picture show to see a drama. Some people will be
disgruntled because they prefer a comedy or a love story. You
please some and others are discontented.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Betty Layton concedes that the park appears to be thriving
and admits her grandson has enjoyed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it's here,'' she said, ``you want it to succeed.''

ARE ALL TRIPS CREATED EQUAL? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most remarkable travel-related trends is this:
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, 1 percent of all business travelers were women. By the
turn of the century, that figure is expected to be 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in a new book, ``The Smart Woman's Guide to Business
Travel'' (Career Press, $14.99), Laurie Borman, editor of Endless
Vacations magazine and a frequent traveler, writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often businesswomen miss out on priceless travel
experiences. After their workday is done, they hole up in their
rooms, reluctant to go out and see the sights. Perhaps they're
uncertain of the area or afraid to go out on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of embracing the opportunities that our work brings,
all too often we women suffer through them. But armed with a little
knowledge, a good strategy and a positive outlook, it's easy to
turn business travel tribulations into wonderful adventures.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RESPECT LACKING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle, Borman suggests, is that some elements of the
travel industry are slow in adapting to changing times.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many women traveling, it would seem that hotels, car
rental agencies, airlines and other travel providers would be
catering to our needs,'' she writes. ``Although some do, most do
not. And most travel books don't separate businesswomen's needs
from businessmen's needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing one recent survey, Borman says most female travelers
``simply want to be treated at least the same as men, but with some
regard to their particular needs, such as getting help with excess
luggage and offering safe waiting areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Members of the survey group thought that they were
often treated with less respect and received poor customer service
in comparison with men.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle travel writer Syd Kearney has journeyed to
many parts of the world and agrees that women's needs often aren't
properly addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At hotels, for instance, we need more towels than men do, if
only to put our hair up,'' Kearney says. ``Even budget
accommodations should provide skin lotion. Some women really want a
makeup mirror. And hair dryers should be in every room. I am
pleased that it's become standard for many hotels to include an
ironing board and iron among room amenities.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SAFETY FACTORS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More important, Kearney says, are safety concerns. Kearney's
first-floor room at one budget motel was burglarized last year, and
she says, ``I now pay closer attention to security measures. I'm
shocked at how easily some `locked' windows can be opened. And
deadbolt locks on doors should be required.''
</P>
<P>
   Peepholes placed high on doors are a pet peeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many women are petite, and the peepholes are useless to
them,'' Kearney says. ``I was impressed that the new Portofino Bay
Hotel in Orlando (Fla.) has two peepholes in each door. One is at
child level. At least that's some help for adults who aren't
tall.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other hotels have adopted laudable policies. The Pan
Pacific San Francisco, a luxury lodging, offers a personal escort
to guest rooms upon request, and each room is equipped with an
easily accessed button that can be used to summon emergency
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Borman's book cites other factors that can affect women's
enjoyment of the travel experience:
</P>
<P>
   One chapter focuses on ``Keeping Your Home in Order,'' a
significant issue given that studies show that when men travel, 95
percent rely on their spouses to maintain the household, but that
20 percent of married women seek help elsewhere, such as a friend
or hired help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can be more important than the peace of mind you'll
have knowing that everyone and everything is safe and under control
while you're away,'' writes Borman.
</P>
<P>
   Being apart from children is particularly difficult. Among
Borman's suggestions: ``If your child loves your nightly stories or
you have a favorite book you like to share, tape record a reading
of the book and let your child listen to that each night before
going to bed. You might also want to tape record or videotape a
daily message in case you can't talk to your child on the phone
each night.''
</P>
<P>
   Once on the road, though, Borman says it's essential that women
give some priority to themselves and seize the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual for women to be intimidated by traveling
alone,'' she writes. ``Getting over the dread of being lonely or
bored is the first hurdle. Then it's time to figure out what can be
fun, yet safe, for a woman to do alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women tend to use room service so they won't have to face
sitting alone at a table in a room full of couples and other
parties. Dining solo doesn't have to be intimidating, though. The
hotel concierge can offer ideas for small restaurants that have
just a few tables and cater to single diners. Restaurants often
define a city's culture _ why miss out on a chance to explore that
culture. Dining alone is also a great opportunity to exercise a
more adventurous palate.''
</P>
<P>
   Borman does provide valuable insight from a woman's perspective.
And some chapters _ especially one on etiquette issues _ are
clearly geared to female travelers.
</P>
<P>
   But I can't help thinking that many of the issues she and
Kearney raise also apply to men. Safety is our top priority, even
if we aren't always as quick to admit it. We, too, miss the family
when we're away. And I'll confess to spending many an evening
munching on room service.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to hear from other women travelers about their special
concerns. From men, too. How different are our travel priorities
and needs? Write me at 801 Texas, Houston, Texas 77002. Or e-mail

COURTS BLOCK PRAYERS BEFORE TEXAS FOOTBALL GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZEKE MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ High school football has long been considered
sacred in Texas, but a recent court ruling says the pitched battles
over pigskin are not appropriate occasions for public-school
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans,
which the U.S. Supreme Court has been asked to review, will end
ritual pre-game prayers in many communities when the football
season kicks off next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly none of us, nor the community, agree with the
decision,'' said Marc Williamson, superintendent in Fredericksburg,
where traditional prayers for sportsmanship and safe play have
reluctantly been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Fredericksburg School Board President Charlie Kiehne called it a
difficult decision. ``It's a situation again where I feel the
minority is telling the majority what to do,'' Kiehne said. But, he
said, ``It's not good fiscal management of taxpayers dollars to go
into court, knowing your going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Association of School Boards is urging its members to
abide by the court ruling. ``The odds of it being resolved before
the football season ends this year are almost zero,'' Shellie
Hoffman, a staff lawyer for the association, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute concerns the Sante Fe School District policy of
allowing student-led prayers to be broadcast over the public
address system at home football games. The unidentified parents of
two students in Santa Fe, a town of 10,000 people southeast of
Houston, filed a lawsuit in 1995 claiming that pre-game prayers
violated the constitutional separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The district policy allowed graduating students to choose by
secret ballot whether to have an invocation or benediction at
commencement ceremonies. A similar policy was used for prayers
preceding football games, which the district court struck down.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1 ruling in February, the appeals court justices found
that while limited prayer may be suitable at once-in-a-lifetime
events like graduation, football games ``are hardly the sober type
of annual event that can be appropriately solemnized with prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The school district appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court after the
5th Circuit Court refused to reconsider its decision.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was ``a victory for the Bill of Rights'' said Jay
Jacobson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union
of Texas, which represented the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prayer is the ultimate religious observance. Clearly, it has
no secular purpose,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed to address a ``pervasively religious
atmosphere in the classroom,'' he said, ``including the practice of
leading the kids in prayer before lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Attorney General John Cornyn have
joined the fight to protect prayer at the games, and plan to file
friend-of-the-court briefs backing the school district next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush supports the rights of students to participate
in the free exercise of religion, a right that is guaranteed by the
Constitution,'' Linda Evans, a Bush spokeswoman, said Monday. ``He
believes government should not dictate or censor the content of
voluntary student-led prayer.''

   WITH: WRESTLING WOMEN: Sitting with 16 relatives and friends in
her small East Boston apartment, her eyes locked on the television
set, 34-year-old Sharon Tiso could contain herself no longer. After
all, a 500-pound mountain of a professional wrestler known as The
Big Show had just lifted World Wrestling Federation owner Vince
McMahon off the ground like a lumpy sack of potatoes. And as Tiso
and millions of other viewers knew well, McMahon is the bitter
enemy of Stone Cold Steve Austin, wrestling's nihilist Texas
glamour guy, because he doesn't much care for Austin's attitude. So
what's a mother to do, especially one who's a Stone Cold Steve
Austin adulator?

 &HT;    Designer gives French furnishings new twist
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, July 29.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The dust rarely settles on Mary Bairstow's furniture.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that her Atlanta home serves as a showroom/photo
studio for many of the pieces she designs for her small Atlanta
home furnishings business.
</P>
<P>
   But even if her pieces didn't come and go, Bairstow believes in
constantly moving furniture around, trying new combinations, mixing
traditional with contemporary, formal with casual. Among her
collections are elegant hand-painted European reproductions that,
despite the gilded legs, black-lacquered finishes and straight
backs, invite visitors to prop up their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to take these pieces back to a patina that looks
old,'' she says. ``People think of painted furniture that's French
or Italian as very formal, but, to steal a phrase, this is more
`barefoot elegance.'''
</P>
<P>
   Furniture trend forecasters say the casual French look such as
Bairstow's _ more sophisticated than country French but less fussy
than formal antiques _ is among several that consumers can expect
to see in stores beginning this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in painted furniture in general has soared for several
years. What's fueling the trend, Bairstow says, are the influences
of European eclectic decors and Americans' penchant for second
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are becoming more sophisticated in their
decorating. They're seeing European publications, traveling more
and getting more comfortable with mixing pieces,'' she says.
``Americans traditionally have taken one style or look in
furnishings and carried it through the entire house, while
Europeans are known for taking a fancy gilded piece and mixing it
with cotton, which softens a room and adds a casualness to it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a growing number of middle-aged Atlantans are
buying weekend getaway homes where they're more comfortable with
casual furnishings such as painted pieces, housing experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hand-painted pieces give a softness to a room and are very
compatible with fabrics,'' says Paul Atwell of Ardley Hall, the
High Point, N.C., wholesale distributor for Bairstow Designs. ``A
lot of people think they can decorate with only one wood and one
pattern of fabric, like the old suites of furniture, but design has
shifted totally away from that. Painted pieces make a wonderful
accent.''
</P>
<P>
   The look is a high-end, sophisticated niche Bairstow decided to
target four years ago when she entered the design business. It's
also one that's earned her national recognition in the current
issue of Victoria magazine as one of 23 ``enterprising women.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine antiques to shabby chic. Bairstow _ who in past lives was
an advertising agency owner, stockbroker, photographer and real
estate agent _ caught the design bug while honeymooning five years
ago in the south of France. She was instantly intrigued by the many
hand-painted antiques housed in the Villa Rothschild, the
17th-century mansion museum. ``I thought to myself, people should
be able to have stuff like this without having to pay a fortune for
fine antiques,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, she and a friend recruited a faux painter and
manufacturer to produce a small collection of hand-painted chairs
and other pieces, which they showed at the Atlanta International
Gift and Home Furnishings Market. ``After selling one piece, we
said, `This is not good.'''
</P>
<P>
   Their work was better received at the High Point furniture
market, but soon after the two decided to dissolve their
partnership. ``The next six months were horrible,'' Bairstow says.
``I had all this money invested.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Ardley Hall noticed a national magazine ad for her
pieces and agreed to represent her, providing showroom exposure
around the country, including Brice Ltd. at the wholesale Atlanta
Decorative Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, demand has grown steadily, Atwell says, and the
small cottage industry now produces three lines _ one for Ardley
Hall and two sold exclusively on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Ardley Hall Collection consists of more than 75 pieces,
including beds, chairs and armoires, in finishes such as antique
black, gold, gold leaf and walnut. They retail from several hundred
dollars for a planter to $12,000 for a gilded four-poster bed. Her
Colors of Provence Collection, co-created by Bairstow and
Savoir-Faire, an Atlanta decorative painting business, includes
hand-painted tables ($750) and chairs ($250) in pastel country
French shades. And in her newest line, the Home Collection, she
teamed up with Atlantan Jo Santospirito to offer upholstered pieces
in a ``shabby chic'' yet tailored look, including a tufted daybed
and sexy sheer-slipcovered plume chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got very diverse lines, from French Provincial to her
black pieces with gold on them _ something for a lot of different
tastes _ and all very romantic,'' says Kim Freeman, a New York
designer and contributing editor for Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   From magazines to Web sites. The design process begins in the
basement office of Bairstow's 1950s Blackland Road rancher, which
she and husband Robert have renovated, including updating the
kitchen and remodeling the den.
</P>
<P>
   ``We entertain a lot, and people tell us they feel so
comfortable here'' among the pieces, Bairstow says. ``It's all here
to be touched and lived with'' _ especially with three kids around.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, Bairstow comes up with a design concept by scanning
European magazines. A photo of an antique chair inspires her design
for a foot; the corner of a bedpost yields an idea for a headboard.
``You have to look at the whole spectrum of design, from fashion to
cars to homes _ casual clothing, SUVs, second homes,'' she says,
when creating home furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   After assembling photo clippings of things she likes, she begins
to notice trends, then asks herself what she would like in her own
home. She then culls a collection of ideas that she presents to
artists and her manufacturer, Nottingham Antiques, without even a
sketch. ``I don't draw. I don't even sketch worth a hoot,''
Bairstow says. ``But I'm very visual and good at communicating my
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Artist Mimi Chekroune, her Savoir-Faire painting partner,
vouches for that. ``Mary is very professional and knows what she
wants,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   New pieces take about four months to create and because of the
small production, the company is able to deliver custom orders in
six to eight weeks _ about half the time of most large
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Delayed delivery is one of the biggest issues dogging the
furniture industry and one reason consumers increasingly are
turning to online shopping. Direct sales allow small companies such
as Bairstow's to bypass the retailer, which typically doubles or
triples manufacturer prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, I think most furniture will be sold on the
Internet,'' she says. ``Sure, there will be stores and shows but
not on the same level that exists today.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Bairstow's basking in the success of the mix _
at home and in business.

   Mixing styles and materials of furnishings and accessories can
give a room rich texture. Designer Mary Bairstow suggested these
ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't be afraid to combine traditional with contemporary.
(Hang modern art over an antique chest, for example).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mix styles of furniture _ matching pieces can be static and
boring. Throw a painted armoire or painted lamp into the mix,
adding one piece at the time. Just don't overdo it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Display your children's artwork for a personal touch, but be
sure to frame it professionally.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use fresh flowers to add warmth to a room. Markets have made
them more affordable. Even a bunch of tall grasses in an urn can
make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Create ambience by lighting a room with multiple sources _
canned halogens, floor lamps, picture lights _ and using dimmer
switches and low-watt bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use candles to add personality to a room. In a vacant
fireplace, group lots of them _ not just two _ in different shapes
and sizes but the same color. And don't discard them after they've
burned down a bit; the worn look has character.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rearrange furnishings often. Move everything out of the room
and add back one piece at the time, trying different arrangements
and pieces from other rooms. Use a daybed as a couch in the living
room.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Create a focal point, whether it's a large piece of art,
painted furniture, a floral arrangement or large palm.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accessorize a sofa or chair with pretty scarves or throws.
Cover an ugly coffee table with a tapestry rug.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use books for texture and height. Stack them on the floor, on
tables to raise a lamp and under accessories in bookcases. Open
some to display beautiful pictures.

 &HT;    There's something primeval about a mushroom
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, July 29.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   July's scattered cloudbursts may have rained on a parade here
and a picnic there, but they made up for that by growing enough
mushrooms to make a million umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the number and variety I found during walks in the
garden and woods, that damp rot that hung around for weeks must
have been just what the fungi ordered. Turns out, the sogginess was
a kind of gardening opportunity, one that came in real handy
recently, as I didn't feel much like digging and pruning and
weeding in the wet.
</P>
<P>
   But hunting mushrooms hit the spot.
</P>
<P>
   With some 10,000 known types, the possibilities seem infinite.
From tiny to gigantic, in myriad colors, with and without stalks,
popping out of the ground or jutting from rotting stumps and logs,
they intrigue. Always have, from the time we children admired the
magical, mystical toadstool. To this day, I appreciate mushrooms
wherever they pop up _ in the forest or in my garden, where, like
mosses, they enhance my grass-free
</P>
<P>
   spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Once, I tried to grow them. On one of those logs that had been
``seeded'' with spores. Following directions, I kept it inside
until spring, then took the log outside and banged it on the ground
(to wake the sleeping spores?). I did everything but turn around in
three circles and murmur incantations, but no mushrooms appeared _
reminding me again of mosses; they grow where they are happy.
</P>
<P>
   There's something primeval about a mushroom; it is wonderfully
pungent, like the earth itself.
</P>
<P>
   It grows in dead wood and on lands laid bare, but it reeks of
life. And in another contradiction, its happy image also is
haunting for those of us who grew up in the 1940s and '50s,
watching killer bombs produce mushroom clouds.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World,'' published in 1996, one
of his several books on mushrooms, Paul Stamets notes that he has
found them everywhere, from canyons to waterfalls to ravines ``that
led into the heart of dormant volcanoes'' and calls mushrooms
symbols of ``the bridge between life and death.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, that fantastically beautiful bridge can take you
right out of here. I look, but I don't eat, as I'm not expert
enough to identify edible mushrooms with certainty nor foolish
enough to eat them on a guess, even one bolstered by picture books.
</P>
<P>
   While I love the taste of good fungi _ morel, shiitake, oyster,
truffle, chanterelle come to mind _ I don't love them as much as
the rich man I recall reading about years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those stories that's as likely apocryphal as not, this
man ordered his cook to prepare a mess of mushrooms that had a
reputation for a heavenly taste. He knew they were quite deadly, as
are the two most often eaten mistakenly, the aptly named destroying
angel and death cap.
</P>
<P>
   After enjoying his meal of a lifetime, the man supposedly made
himself comfortable in his bed and said with a contented sigh,
``Now I can die in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   I must say, some of the mushrooms I saw recently were
tantalizingly beautiful. If looks determined taste, these would
have been to die for. Little red ones, with white-edged 1-inch caps
and raised white dots all over. Jewels.
</P>
<P>
   A brown-leather-looking one about 6 inches across grew curled
edges that gave it a saddlelike quality, looking for all the world
as if some creature from Lilliput had just dismounted and strolled
into the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Clustered, one on top of another, three mushrooms the color of
creamed coffee stood on short stems amid decaying pine straw.
Nearby, a white one looked just like a pancake as the skillet's
heat pushes tiny holes through its uncooked side. Another one,
golden, resembled tea cakes waiting to be eaten. And one mimicked a
small black grapefruit half, fleshy side up, perched on a 3-inch
stalk.
</P>
<P>
   Most seductive on one hungry afternoon was a grouping that I
could swear was the delicious morel. I could almost swear.
</P>
<P>
   The maybe-morel stayed where it was, to entertain and entice
others. I remain a strictly ornamental mushroom man _ enjoying them
where they come.

 &HT;    Create a patina of time in minutes
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, July 29.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill,
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the final installment in our Summer Workshop series, a
step-by-step guide to doing inexpensive weekend projects for the
home or garden. The Fall Workshop series will begin in September.
</P>
<P>
   Some people long for a home full of new furniture and
accessories. Others want their furnishings to have that weathered
or rustic look, without the benefit of time taking its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Brownlee, owner of Decor, an accent furniture and
accessories shop on Howell Mill Road in Atlanta, says the antique
look is easy to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   The process of aging metal and some wood products is called
verdigris, and the simplest way to get this age-old look is with an
antique surface kit that contains a selection of copper, brass,
bronze or metal finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This look is very popular on the interior, and it certainly
works on the outside,'' Brownlee said. ``But on the inside it makes
objects look like a valuable antique.''
</P>
<P>
   Supplies:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Patina Antiquing Kit, which includes cleaner; metal, copper,
brass or bronze finishes; gloves; sponges; brushes. (Depending on
size of object, more than one kit may be needed.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  2 plastic cups (optional).
</P>
<P>
   Getting started:
</P>
<P>
   Step 1: Using a brush, clean object with cleaner. Let dry for at
least 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Step 2: Pour your choice of finish into a cup, or use from the
can. Paint first coat of finish on object and let dry for 30 to 45
minutes. (For a more rustic effect, apply sealer to first coat of
finish while it is sticky to the touch.)
</P>
<P>
   Step 3: Apply second coat of finish to the object. Final coat
can be poured on to make object appear as if it has aged naturally.
(You need at least two coats of finish.)
</P>
<P>
   Step 4: When desired rustic effect is achieved, brush on paint
sealer. The sealer stops the rusting process. Allow sealer to dry
thoroughly before putting object in its place.

CHICKEN EMBRYO VIDEO PRECEDED FILM DIRECTOR'S DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' might be Michael Patrick
Jann's debut as a director of feature films, but it isn't the first
movie he ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Far from it. For that, you have to go all the way back to
the mid-1980s and the hallowed halls of Albany Academy.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jann's sophomore year. Somewhere he got ahold of a school
videocamera, and somehow he used it to make a short film as a
project for biology class. The subject? Chicken embryos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of a funny little movie,'' recalls Jann, who was
born in Buffalo, moved to the Albany suburb of Colonie at age 6,
and now makes his home in southern California. ``That was the first
thing I actually shot and edited. It was like, `Here! I made
this!'''
</P>
<P>
   Jann doesn't actually chuckle _ his sense of humor is far too
dry _ but a sharp point of irony pokes through the self-effacement.
A half-hour phone interview is one torrent of words after another,
a downpour of comic musings that curl at the end with a Gen X lilt.
He's 29, he's smart, and his debut feature film is opening to a
loud media hum. He's also in a very good mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop Dead Gorgeous,'' a black-black-black comic mockumentary
about murder and mayhem in a small-town beauty pageant, premiered
July 12 to a large (and appreciative) Hollywood crowd. ``I
recommend everybody has their own Hollywood premiere.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, he says, ``really, really cool.'' Jann doesn't say ``gee
whiz,'' but you can hear the amazement in his voice _ the stunned
realization that, yikes, this Hollywood Thing is happening to him.
He's wary of the industry's endless glad-handing (``No one will say
anything nasty about you, but they'll think terrible things about
you'') and suspects he'll always be a bit of an interloper.
``Certainly I'm an outsider _ the oddball,'' he says. ``But I'd
rather be that. I'd rather be the guy who's unique.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, he is. First, he managed to turn around a
mainstream, studio-backed picture for less than $10 million.
Second, he managed to get it made at all. Mean little mock
documentaries with a tone best described as noir-meets-Mary Kay
Cosmetics-on-a-tractor don't get made every day.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a fictitious small town in Minnesota (actually a pastiche
of seven small towns), ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' stars Kirsten Dunst
and Denise Richards as beauty pageant contestants, Ellen Barkin as
Dunst's rough-trade mom and Kirstie Alley as Richards' demon mother
from hell. The film follows these and others through several weeks
of pageant preparation, during which one character dies on an
exploding thresher, another grafts her hand to a detonating beer
and a third expires while riding a gaseous parade float.
</P>
<P>
   It's all-or-nothing humor: You either bust a gut or wince. Any
movie in which the heroine says ``I owe my life to that deaf baby''
and gets a laugh doing it isn't the sort of multiplex fodder we've
grown accustomed to. The director accepts that. In screenings,
``about halfway through the movie it reaches a critical mass, where
people just can't stop laughing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it easier for people to enjoy it. ... But sometimes
people are sitting there saying, `Should I laugh at this? Is it OK
to laugh at this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Jann is probably best known as a member of The State, a New York
University comedy troupe that found fame a few years back on MTV
and, briefly, CBS. Since then he's made his mark in commercials,
directing spots for Sprite and Roundtable Pizza, among others. ``I
have no other skills. I'm really glad that this worked out, because
otherwise, I'd be landscaping at the Holiday Inn at Wolf Road'' _
which, it turns out, he used to do.
</P>
<P>
   He was the assistant groundskeeper, way back when.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' came to be when Jann, combing through
scripts, stumbled across Lona Williams' biting screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just jumped out,'' he says. Williams knew whereof she
wrote, having been a Minnesota Junior Miss title holder and
runner-up in the national pageant. ``People see (the movie) and
say, `Oh my God, it's so absurd, it's so over-the-top, it's so
weird' _ and stuff like that. But most of the things in it are
fairly realistic. It's kind of the entire history of beauty
pageants, condensed into one pageant.''
</P>
<P>
   Jann has nothing against small-town America or Minnesota in
particular, he emphasizes. To the contrary. ``There was a feeling
about Minnesota that reminded me of upstate New York. People were
kind of friendly, and they weren't really fast-talking. ... It was
kind of low-key, nice, a kind of ersatz charm.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Albany area (his mother still lives in Colonie), ``I
really like it up there. It's a fabulous place to raise children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' was originally titled ``Dairy Queens,''
but the venerable ice-cream chain, not charmed by the humor in
Jann's dark romp, sued. Jann finds in this cause for a bone-dry bon
mot.
</P>
<P>
   ``(DQ owner) Warren Buffett is not known for his sense of humor
_ that's not in the Who's Who,'' he says. ``It doesn't say, `Warren
Buffett, corporate executive, noted for his sense of humor.'''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the title swap, he's pleased with the final product.
``I was saying to (Williams) that now that we've finished the
movie, there's a certain sort of anticlimax to it. You finish it
and you're proud of it,'' he says. ``But then, the only thing both
of us wanted was for every man, woman and child to walk up to us
and say, `Nice job.' We just wanted that acknowledgment from
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lull following ``Gorgeous,'' Jann plans to make a few
more ads (``pump up that bank account'') and direct a Fox
television pilot from one of the writers for ``Seinfeld.'' After
that, maybe another feature film _ a script he wrote, another
comedy, called ``You Are Going To Prison.'' And who knows? Maybe
he'll spread his wings, do something else _ a big fat action flick
or a brooding drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know about Arnold Schwarzenegger,'' he says,
when the idea is proffered to him. ``But I just love movies. I
think that I have a sense of comedy _ that's just what I've been
doing for the past 10 years. That's my job.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would love to branch out into other things and work in
different genres. I really like old Hollywood movies, all the
different genres _ your detective movies, your war movies. I'd love
to make a western. I love that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute _ there's a western dance in ``Drop Dead
Gorgeous.'' ``That's right,'' he says. ``I wanna make the first
all-line-dancing musical.''

HENSON CREATURES AREN'T AN ENDANGERED SPECIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For nearly four decades, the Henson name has
pretty much meant ``puppet'' in the minds of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The late Jim Henson's most durable brainchild, the Muppets, and
all the spinoffs from that blissfully silly start on ``Sesame
Street'' all have spun out of what once were essentially socks and
foam and inspiration. Those have included all-puppet movies such as
``The Dark Crystal,'' TV shows such as ``Dinosaurs!,'' Henson
Creature Shop creations such as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
and much more.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Henson's death in 1990, his children and the creative
crew continued to put out an array of puppet-based programs, movies
and special effects.
</P>
<P>
   But whither the kingdom of the puppet in the age of the
computer-generated dinosaur?
</P>
<P>
   As David Barrington Holt, head of the Henson Creature Shop
operation in Burbank, puts it: `` &UR;  &LR; `Jurassic Park' happened and
everything changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 dino-sensation sent producers scurrying to dust off old
scripts that were only possible, they thought, with computerized
special effects.
</P>
<P>
   The seamless way director Steven Spielberg wove
computer-generated creatures into his box-office smash seemed to
imply that digital was the only choice for truly compelling special
effects. Puppets were destined to go, well, the way of the
dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   But six years post-Jurassic, Henson's puppet-based empire is
dancing on far more than a string.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Muppet movie _ ``Muppets From Space'' _ just opened,
and the Creature Shop has been finishing post-production work on a
live-action movie of George Orwell's ``Animal Farm'' while shooting
the sequel to another Spielberg dino-fest, ``The Flintstones Viva
Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent times, the company has created sophisticated gorilla
suits for ``George of the Jungle,'' remote-controlled animatronic
animals for the ``Dr. Dolittle'' remake, the massive hydraulic
robots in ``Lost in Space'' and the expressive snowman in ``Jack
Frost.''
</P>
<P>
   They're continuing to put out ``Brats of the Lost Nebula,'' a
sci-fi children's TV show influenced by Japanese anime, and
routinely create television ads, especially in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And the company's big new venture is ``Farscape,'' an hourlong
sci-fi show that's quickly become the highest-rated original
programming on cable's Science Fiction Channel.
</P>
<P>
   All this is happening as the company is absorbing what it can
from the technological revolution around it, melding
computer-imaging techniques and remote-control mechanical servo
devices into the ancient arts so long synonymous with the Henson
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there's a big future for all the technology, and
certainly computers are serving us in all sorts of ways,''
Barrington Holt said. ``But we believe, as Jim did, that there's
something about puppets.''
</P>
<P>
   Now son Brian is head of Jim Henson Studios, trying to figure
out how to finance the ambitious ``Farscape'' while overseeing
production work on three continents.
</P>
<P>
   The show is part of an evolving experiment by the organization
to develop computer skills over the past nine years, Henson said.
It already has paid creative dividends, such as a 1991 technical
Oscar for lip-synching technology for its remote-control puppets
and a share of a 1996 Oscar for visual-effects work on ``Babe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the movie came out, we were besieged by calls from the
press: `Well, what did you do in the movie?''' Barrington Holt
said. ``We told them we made the puppets. They said, `What
puppets?' But when you do your job well, you can't tell they're
puppets.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has delved into computer-generated imagery quite a
bit, using standard 3-D animation packages from companies such as
Alias/Wavefront and SoftImage along with what Barrington Holt calls
``a lot of plug-in custom stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The work is mostly concentrated in the large Creature Shop
operation in London, where initial efforts to get artists and
designers to think in 3-D space proved less successful than
converting puppeteers and even mechanics to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask them to work in a virtual space, it's not a
difficult transition for them,'' Henson said. He added wryly, ``CGI
(computer-generated imagery) is making an insidious expansion in
every corner of our operation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, the company did animatronic stand-ins for
Jean-Jacques Annaud's ``The Bear,'' generally avoiding intercutting
the live and mechanical creatures in the same scene ``because it
would show,'' Barrington Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   That's less of a problem now because the technology allows the
puppeteers to cover minor mistakes and glitches, while allowing
interaction between live actors and remote-controlled puppets whose
motions are largely already blocked out on a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   During filming, as many as several puppeteers may work fine
facial and body movements in concert on a single puppet, reacting
to actors' cues and movements.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of interaction between a living creature and one
that seems to be alive that make sophisticated puppeteering a
viable, even preferable, alternative to using computers to conjure
in a digital creature after live filming is done, Henson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a realer performance, it's directable,'' Henson said.
``If the director doesn't like something in a take, he can go
direct it again.''
</P>
<P>
   That shows in some key scenes in ``Farscape,'' which follows the
misadventures of a young American astronaut whose theories about
galactic travel inadvertently punch him into a different part of
the universe, and into the company of a motley group of fugitives
fleeing an Inspector Javert-like military commander.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take an ordinary Joe and stick him in another world,''
Henson said. ``We constantly remind the audience how weird and
wonderful this world is. That allows it to never become mundane.''
</P>
<P>
   But Henson also had bigger aims in mind for the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we wanted to do was put something on TV that's never been
seen,'' Henson said. ``We wanted something that was more daring,
more fun, and more adult than we've done in the past, but still has
all the imaginative content of our younger shows. We also wanted to
show what we can bring to TV, with stuff that mostly you can only
see in theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Farscape'' combines digital effects such as the external
spaceship shots; animatronic puppets such as an alien pilot of the
runaways' ship; prosthetic makeup on another key character; and
body-painting makeup on yet another.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a space opera with a look and texture that's
remarkably rich for a cable TV budget. And Henson hopes to bring
more computer-generated work, even entirely CG characters, to the
show as the cost of creating those characters drops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still proving too expensive, but the technologies are
catching up,'' Henson said. ``The palette is there, and once it's
cheap enough, we can bring CG characters into the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting of the last of 22 hours of ``Farscape'' episodes is
wrapping up in Australia, as Henson continues to search for at
least one more major market beyond the United States, Australia and
England in which to sell it. The show has already been renewed for
another season on the Science Fiction Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you we've actually gotten there (financially with
the show),'' Henson said. ``I believe we will get there.'' &UR;  &QL;

<P>
   Some Chinese fear ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient times, low wooden planks were installed beneath doors
in palaces and courtyard homes to keep out the ghosts. Inside
gateways, spirit walls were erected to deflect the ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Chinese officials create propaganda to keep the ghosts at
bay. So any open discussion of Chinese extremism _ be it mass
movement or massacre _ is taboo.
</P>
<P>
   To master the past and contain it, new Chinese dynasties
routinely rewrote history. The Communists do the same. So do
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we call it spin control, or cover up. It one way to
skirt responsibility. The Chinese state sanitizes and perverts the
facts of its ugly excesses. So the massacre in Beijing a decade ago
was glossed over. Chinese troops mowed down civilians with gunfire
and killed hundreds _ perhaps many more.
</P>
<P>
   After the bloodshed, shocked and angry citizens decried Premier
Li Peng as a Hitler. Yet the official propaganda portrayed only the
few army troops who were killed as martyrs. Protesters who tried to
fight back were called hooligans.
</P>
<P>
   There was never a full official accounting of all the civilians
who died. Instead the peaceful movement that brought so many
Beijing citizens onto the streets to seek government accountability
and an end to corruption was branded as an unpatriotic rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, lies create doubts. After the brutal military
crackdown in Beijing, many people across China began to ask, ``What
really happened in 1989?'' Ten years later, and they're still
asking.
</P>
<P>
   This haunts China's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   China has changed in the ten years since Tienanmen Square. Many
people are richer. But most Chinese are still poor. Many feel
aggrieved and insecure. Angry at a tide of layoffs. Abandoned by
the institutions they came to depend on. In their disenchantment
burns the seeds of backlash to an economic reform program, and
revulsion against corruption and abuse of power. Today, many
Chinese people are in a prickly mood.
</P>
<P>
   To deflect this public unease, the government nurtures the
notion that ``foreign hostile forces'' are afoot. In their
internal, semisecret propaganda, the Communists have long marked
America as a ``sensitive'' or hostile country. A dangerous ghost
over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   By habit, foreigners _ often called ``foreign ghosts'' _ are
kept at a distance. Foreign businessmen who seek to make money from
China seldom do. But why should they? The Chinese need to conserve
what little they have. Why should the greed of outsiders outstrip
the need of insiders?
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese aim to gather and glean everything they can to
improve their lot. They have appetites for hamburgers, computer
software and missile technology. They will continue to appropriate
high-technology designs or tabloid television styles and then adapt
them.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese people may be mesmerized by Hollywood movies or
American ideals of perfectibility. Many may envy Western wealth or
democratic values. But Western forms will ultimately be infused
with Chinese content.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are mistaken if they assume that the Chinese want to
become like us. They don't. Neither do they wish to be bullied.
Consequently, the zeal of the new Western missionary quest for
globalization makes some in China feel vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Does globalization mean interchange or is it a cover for
exploitation and interference? The specter of a world where the
right to seek justice for groups or individuals involves crossing
national borders is a new ghost. The Chinese want to exorcise it.
</P>
<P>
   Once NATO attacked Serbia, the Chinese government could easily
conjure up future Western military involvement in Taiwan, Tibet or
Xinjiang _ zones Beijing regards as its sacred territory. That's
why China's propaganda created a potent anti-Western narrative
central to the war in former-Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   With the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, more
new ghosts were let loose. The CIA may claim the strike was an
accident, but to the Chinese, the CIA is an organization of spooks.
In China, it is both an article of faith and a tenet of propaganda
that the bombing was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, the Chinese have stewed about their history of
exploitation, occupation and pillage by foreign powers. This
history has scarred the Chinese psyche.
</P>
<P>
   So when the government lit the fuse by approving demonstrations
and sanctifying them as patriotic, a reservoir of anger poured out
on streets across China and in front of the U.S. embassy in
Beijing. Some of the outrage was shared by the more Western-leaning
citizens of Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China played the xenophobia card. The three Chinese killed in
Belgrade were honored as martyrs _ very deliberately _ to send a
message to all Chinese that they were the victims of ``the U.S.-led
NATO.'' Chinese posters caricatured not Li Peng, but President
Clinton, as Hitler. It was a bizarre echo of the aftermath of the
Beijing massacre.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese press largely avoided reporting on the ethnic
cleansing in Kosovo, as it avoided reporting the protester
cleansing in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   More ghosts are floating about.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is making allegations of Chinese spying. This is
America's xenophobia card. It could create a climate of fear and
suspicion that unfairly tars some Chinese and Chinese Americans.
Yet little has been said about American espionage operations.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, the Chinese are busy picking up dissidents and
remaking Tiananmen Square. They are preparing to lay new paving
stones in the Square, as if such a literal cover up could tamp down
the ghosts of the massacre and forever deter any popular
demonstrations to mark it.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, however, the same people who are asking ``What
really happened in Beijing in 1989?'' may ask ``What really
happened in Kosovo in 1999?''
</P>
<P>
   For now, to those asking ``What really happened in Belgrade?''
America has a chance and a duty to set a standard for
accountability by giving the Chinese a full and honest explanation
of how and why their embassy came to be attacked. Then expose and
punish those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   To get along and get ahead it is critical that Americans and
Chinese avoid extremism. It also is a time to be firm and
fair-minded. People in both countries require leaders who demand
accountability, act with restraint, and do not flinch from the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to confront the ghosts.

HOMICIDES CREATE UNEASE AT YOSEMITE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. _ Four recent homicides in the
Yosemite area have taken a heavy toll on park employees, especially
because the latest victim belonged to their own tight-knit
community.
</P>
<P>
   The grisly death last week of Joie Armstrong, a naturalist with
the Yosemite Institute, hit home more than other recent incidents
in the park, said Peter Werner, a bartender at the park's historic
and upscale Ahwahnee hotel and restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The murders of the three women was one thing,'' he said,
referring to the deaths in February of tourists Carole Sund, her
daughter Juli and family friend Silvina Pelosso. ``But this other
woman was an employee and we knew her.''
</P>
<P>
   Peer counselors have met with 80 to 100 National Park Service
employees since Friday, said team leader Scott Brown. He said
employees have felt a flood of emotions _ anger, grief, fear _ and
they did not ebb with the arrest of Cary Stayner and reports that
the 37-year-old handyman has confessed to all four killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``During an instance like this, emotions are constantly
changing,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, hundreds of Armstrong's friends and members of her
family gathered in the park for an outdoor memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   John Carlstroem, executive director of the Headlands Institute,
where Armstrong had once been employed as a field instructor, said
plans were being shaped for some kind of a lasting memorial tribute
to Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   The somber mood in El Portal, the tiny town near the park
entrance where many of Armstrong's colleagues live, was mixed
Monday with a growing anger directed at reporters who have invaded
their usually quiet and laid-back community.
</P>
<P>
   At the El Portal Market, next to the Yosemite Institute, a group
of locals sitting on the shady porch steps shouted at an
approaching reporter to go away. Inside, the cashier complained
about dozens of reporters who called him. He said he hung up on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Television news vans were parked outside Cedar Lodge, where the
FBI continued to question employees about Stayner. One employee,
who declined to give his name, complained that all this attention
is scaring away business.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Cedar Lodge, where Stayner has worked and lived
intermittently for almost two years, was booked solid Monday night.

WINE TALK: LESSONS FROM BORDEAUX'S UP-AND-DOWN PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``From the moment when you start to think of wine as an
investment and not as something to be drunk, that's the end,'' Elie
de Rothschild said almost 30 years ago, when he was managing
partner of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild in Bordeaux. His words,
applied to today's frenzied market, are still wise, if anyone will
heed them.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the Bordeaux wine market had gone mad. After a string
of mediocre vintages, the world was ready for a good Bordeaux, and
1970 supplied that demand. Americans, for the first time, had
become important players in the Bordeaux market. Thanks to the
publicity engendered by the excellent 1959 and the legendary 1961
vintages, Bordeaux sales to the United States had been increasing
10 percent a year through the 1960s. In 1969, they increased 50
percent from the prior year. The value of good older vintages shot
up as well.
</P>
<P>
   As de Rothschild said, Bordeaux wine had changed from a drink to
an investment. But his timing was a bit off; it wasn't until 1973
that the Bordeaux market collapsed, and it took almost a decade
before the market fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Since those days, a new generation of wine drinkers _ and wine
investors _ has appeared on the scene, just as eager to pay any
price for high-end Bordeaux wines and to hold them as investments
rather than to consume. The Bordeaux trade has gone through
fundamental changes since the early 1970s but there are few signs
that it is any less susceptible to the boom-and-bust cycles of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   New investors in Bordeaux with little sense of the past and big
spenders who think the party will go on indefinitely would do well
to read ``The Winemasters of Bordeaux,'' Nicholas Faith's absorbing
book about the Bordeaux wine trade. First published in 1978, it has
been thoroughly updated and just released by Prion ($29.95). Given
the current state of the Bordeaux market, with wines like Chateau
Petrus selling for $500 a bottle and more, Faith could not have
chosen a more opportune time to reissue his book.
</P>
<P>
   Faith, a former business editor of The Sunday Times of London
and a contributor to The Financial Times, first explains Bordeaux's
beginnings as a medieval trading center. But he concentrates on the
wine trade's long, painful transformation from a fusty,
inward-looking community based on family ties, to a business that
has opened itself to the modern world, though somewhat grudgingly.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, he writes about the rise and fall of the Chartronnais,
the small group of powerful merchants, mostly of foreign origin,
who controlled the Bordeaux market for two centuries. Originally
banned from the center of Bordeaux by the local wine merchants, the
foreigners, who came from Germany, Scandinavia, Britain and
Ireland, settled just outside the city along the Quai des
Chartrons. Beginning with the export markets to their countries of
origin, the Chartronnais came to dominate the entire Bordeaux wine
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of the Chartronnais families _ the Cruses, the
Eschenauers, the Bartons and the Johnstons _ began to wane after
World War II. To Faith, it was Baron Philippe de Rothschild, who
took over his family's property, Mouton-Rothschild, just after
World War I, who began to change things. Traditionally, the
Chartronnais bought wine from the chateaus, bottled it, aged it,
sold it and shipped it. Philippe de Rothschild chose to do it all
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually many other chateau owners did the same, taking
control of their own wine. In 1973, the most powerful of all the
Chartronnais families, the Cruses, were convicted of buying cheap
wine and selling it as higher-quality Bordeaux. The trial, which
became known as Winegate, made it clear that many of the merchant
families had routinely done the same.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 1971 and 1972 vintages were of indifferent quality,
investors snapped them up. With prices still high and a glut of
wine from the enormous 1973 crop, demand began to drop rapidly. The
world oil crisis and, to some extent, suspicions raised by the
Winegate affair turned off would-be buyers. Investors who bought
the 1971 and 1972 wines before they had been bottled watched
helplessly as the prices of those wines plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   The golden days quickly ended, as they almost inevitably will
again. How long will the current boom last? In this country, at
least, as long as the economy, which fuels it, continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Will Bordeaux survive the next crisis? Almost certainly, as it
has each crisis in the past. The Chartronnais are gone, and so for
the most part are the international liquor companies that invested
in the chateaus for a time. A new breed, including insurance
companies and wealthy private individuals, has moved in.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the old families who had been under the thumb of the
Chartronnais have come to the fore. They are typified by
Jean-Michel Cazes, who owns Chateau Lynch-Bages in Pauillac and Les
Ormes-de-Pez in St.-Estephe. He also manages half a dozen
properties, including Chateau Pichon-Baron in Pauillac for AXA, an
insurance company with wine investments in France, Portugal and
Hungary. Like many of the new Bordeaux wine merchants, he was
educated in the United States and is at home selling wine anywhere
in world.
</P>
<P>
   The prestige of owning a Bordeaux chateau has always been high
and, if anything, has grown over the last 15 years, when so many
vintages have been good to superb. But as Faith shows and as any
serious wine buyer should know, the Bordeaux wine trade is like no
other business anywhere. To sum it up, Faith, paraphrasing Winston
Churchill's description of democracy, calls it ``the worst system
ever invented, except all the others that anyone has ever thought
of.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In one night at Gramercy Tavern, I had a dish of
creamy lemon panna cotta, a coconut tapioca pudding with cilantro
syrup, a chocolate ganache cake, an intense chocolate caramel tart,
a scoop of burned caramel ice cream, and bay leaf ice cream, too, a
chestnut cookie, a black currant gelee, a chocolate filled with
hazelnut cream, an orange macaroon and a white chocolate square
with toasted coconut.
</P>
<P>
   And all I did was order dessert.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of experience that sticks fast in your mind, but
these days it's not all that uncommon. Starting with a small taste
before the dessert and then progressing to a flight of desserts
arranged on a plate and a petit four selection that looks more like
a pastry shop, dessert is becoming a longer, more sophisticated and
often outrageous affair.
</P>
<P>
   Until about five years ago, dessert in American restaurants had
merely been a way to punctuate the end of a meal. A buttery pastry
and sweet apples, perhaps. Or a wallop of chocolate. It was
something clear and concise that told you it was time to get up
from the table and go home.
</P>
<P>
   But pastry chefs are being taken more seriously, with their
names on the menu and a celebrity quotient of their own. And their
patrons are going out to dinner in search less of sustenance than
of entertainment. The result: dessert has ballooned from a single
course to a banquet.
</P>
<P>
   Cello, a new restaurant on East 77th Street, leads diners into
dessert with a sorbet. The actual dessert follows, as does a whole
lot more: a petit four plate, a dish of chocolates and, with the
check, hot orange flower beignets. Cafe Boulud serves a similar
progression, starting with soup and ending with madeleines instead
of beignets.
</P>
<P>
   If you order the $93 fixed-price menu at March, you get sorbet
to start and almond pralines as a kicker, and in between a sampling
of three desserts off the regular menu. This sampling is also
available on the $68 menu. Eighty percent of diners order the
sampling, said Wayne Nish, the chef.
</P>
<P>
   Culinary schools are training the next generation to meet the
new demands. The French Culinary Institute in New York, for
instance, includes dessert composition, petits fours and tasting
plates in its curriculum. Pastry students are also required to dine
at restaurants and report back on the style and design of the
dessert menu.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the old days of the single dessert, Gramercy
Tavern's pastry chef, Claudia Fleming, said: ``I think when you
realize that nobody finished their desserts that you were very
limited in terms of your creativity. And for me the fun of eating
dessert is these little tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I had so many tiny courses at her restaurant,
working through a flavor spectrum starting with fruit and cream and
finishing with intense chocolate. Often, Ms. Fleming sneaks in
tasting plates, too, like permutations on apple _ an apple tart,
apple ice cream and an apple napoleon.
</P>
<P>
   At Union Pacific, diners can pay a supplement of $12 on the $65
fixed price menu for a ``flight of desserts.'' Three not-so-small
plates of dessert are delivered at once; as with a cheese plate,
the server describes the order in which to eat them. One evening, I
began with a peach goat cheese tart, moved on to a chicory bombe
with chocolate puff pastry ravioli and finished with a molten
chocolate cake. Temperatures flip-flopped from hot to cold to hot,
while the flavors progressed from sweet to smoky to bittersweet,
each richer than the next.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it was a bit much. By the time I got to the third
flight, the peanut butter ice cream on the chocolate cake was
melted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of this has to do with pastry chefs showing off
their range after a long period of time being stuck in the back
room,'' said Tish Boyle, an editor at Pastry Art and Design
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But all those sweets did make an impression that just one
dessert would not have. It was lavish and decadent, just the kind
of finale you feel you deserve from a top restaurant charging top
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Pastry chefs with less latitude may not be doling out as many
courses, but they are packing more onto a single plate. At Payard
Patisserie and Bistro, a tasting plate includes five pastries;
diners can choose their own. Oceana offers two samplers for an $8
supplement, with five mini-desserts on each plate.
</P>
<P>
   At Lespinasse, diners receive a sweet amuse-bouche before
dessert and petits fours after _ but just a single main dessert.
The menu always includes one option that is a tasting, like a
pineapple dessert of a pineapple beignet, pina colada sauce,
pineapple jam, pineapple tarragon sorbet and pineapple chips.
``It's a way of showing your ability to manipulate a flavor,'' said
Christopher Broberg, Lespinasse's pastry chef.
</P>
<P>
   Other pastry chefs are serving variations of the same dessert.
Rather than presenting a single large dish of vanilla creme brulee,
for instance, they serve a handful of tiny riffs on the theme. At
Bayard's, the creme brulees are peach, raspberry, vanilla, ginger
and banana. Each dish contains about three spoonfuls, enough to
enliven your palate before the intensity dissipates. Mercer Kitchen
squeezes four onto a plate, all based on tea flavors: citrus, Earl
Grey, chocolate mint and lemon verbena.
</P>
<P>
   Bayard's does not serve a sweet before dessert, but afterward
nine kinds of petits fours and a basket of freshly baked madeleines
arrive. The madeleines are warm, fragrant and bite-size. Before you
know it, you've eaten a half-dozen. Your last impression is pure
bliss or, more likely, bloat.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Luc Dendievel, the chef and pastry chef, is not concerned.
``Well, they eat them,'' he said. Being served madeleines on top of
everything else is part of the experience. ``It's a large room,
there's a big wine list _ everything here is big,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Broberg said, ``I think everywhere in New York now, everyone is
trying to make a lasting last impression.'' Understandably, many
pastry chefs relish making that last impression.
</P>
<P>
   Dessert has traditionally been peripheral to a meal. Like the
appetizer, it's optional. And that may be one reason that pastry
chefs in America have until recently lacked the respect accorded
the chefs producing appetizers and main courses.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Fleming, expanding the dessert course was partly
dictated by the restaurant and partly natural. Gramercy Tavern has
a fixed price menu of $62, but, she said, ``There's always a very
conscious effort to provide good value and to provide unexpected
pleasures and courses and things that haven't been ordered.'' She
also found that she wanted to emulate the chef, Tom Colicchio. ``I
wanted to do what Tom was doing. I wanted to serve three courses.''
</P>
<P>
   Other restaurants have the opposite philosophy of dessert. At
Chanterelle, dessert is reserved and traditional: one plate and
then petits fours. ``For me, intellectually,'' said Karen Waltuck,
an owner, ``the meal ends in a very solid way after the main course
and before cheese. Everything that has come before is taken off the
table _ extra glasses, salt and pepper, bread, butter, crumbs.''
   Dessert, the last imprint of the meal, she said, ``should end
with a certain opulence and generosity and whimsy, but you don't
have to do that with more than one course; people are very full.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, volume never seems to matter. Petit four plates
almost never go untested. Lespinasse even gives a wicker basket to
transport any extras home.
</P>
<P>
   At Park Avenue Cafe, diners should get a shopping cart. The
petit four plate has 14 tastes. Chef David Burke was one of the
first in New York to put dessert on a pedestal _ literally. When he
was at River Cafe in the late 1980s, he served petits fours on a
petit four, a miniature cast-iron oven, containing burning
cinnamon.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there's the petit four tree at Le Cirque 2000. In
addition to Jacque Torres' exaggeratedly large desserts, you may
get a chocolate tree dangling with hazelnut chocolate squares,
cherries and tuiles.
</P>
<P>
   With their new, larger role, pastry chefs face a much more
imposing obstacle _ blending their style with that of the cuisine.
Ideally a meal should be like one long cohesive conversation
sprinkled with ideas and thoughts that meld rather than contradict.
</P>
<P>
   And in most cases, pastry chefs must still defer to the chef. At
Lespinasse, for instance, Broberg purposely mimics the style of his
four-star boss, Christian Delouvrier. ``I look how he sauces his
foie gras,'' he said. ``I look at how he sauces his lamb.'' Then he
applies the same philosophy to his desserts. ``It shouldn't be so
different, either,'' he said. ``Otherwise it's going to be jarring
to the guest.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept seems logical enough, but intellectual harmony
between cuisine and pastry is something of a novel concept.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago at Le Bernardin, for instance, the cuisine
and desserts were out of sync. The style of the chef, Eric Ripert,
was simple and unadorned, the refinement left uniquely in the
flavors of the dish. The desserts, though, were much more
monumental and decorative. Cookies looked as if they had been cut
to shape with a ruler and an Exacto knife. Chocolate tarts were
pristine. After eating an amuse-bouche and two courses of Ripert's
food, it felt like putting on a frilly dress after wearing jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Then in October 1997 he hired a new pastry chef, Florian
Bellanger. ``Until Florian came, I always let the pastry chef do
what he wanted,'' he said. ``I wanted to have the pastry chef
closer to the kitchen and closer to the idea of what I had in mind
for the fish.'' Their styles have merged, but it is a work in
progress, Ripert said. Ultimately, he would like to treat the
components of the desserts with the same reverence with which he
treats fish. ``If we do a peach dessert,'' he said, ``we have to
find the best peach, like we do with the fish. Then the peach is
the star of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bouley Bakery, pastry chef Bill Yosses likens the diner's
experience to a journey. ``They've been through these nuances of
taste and texture up until they get to dessert, and it seems that
should continue through the dessert experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He eases diners from their savory world gently, with either a
clean-tasting, lightly acidic fruit soup or a dish of cheese and
fruit, like the mellow blue fourme d'Ambert with a roasted pear.
Restraint ends there. After that, diners are his to indulge. They
order a main dessert. But extra plates _ like chocolate brioche
pudding, sable breton or whatever Yosses thinks they should sample
as their journey nears its end _ could come their way without
warning. Then, of course, there are the petits fours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chefs had their epiphany with nouvelle cuisine in the '70s,
and pastry chefs haven't had that yet,'' Yosses said. ``Maybe
that's what the year 2000 is all about. The dessert messiah is
coming; the end is near.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is sure. The end of the meal is getting farther and
farther away.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In one night at Gramercy Tavern, I had a dish of
creamy lemon panna cotta, a coconut tapioca pudding with cilantro
syrup, a chocolate ganache cake, an intense chocolate caramel tart,
a scoop of burned caramel ice cream, and bay leaf ice cream, too, a
chestnut cookie, a black currant gelee, a chocolate filled with
hazelnut cream, an orange macaroon and a white chocolate square
with toasted coconut.
</P>
<P>
   And all I did was order dessert.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of experience that sticks fast in your mind, but
these days it's not all that uncommon. Starting with a small taste
before the dessert and then progressing to a flight of desserts
arranged on a plate and a petit four selection that looks more like
a pastry shop, dessert is becoming a longer, more sophisticated and
often outrageous affair.
</P>
<P>
   Until about five years ago, dessert in American restaurants had
merely been a way to punctuate the end of a meal. A buttery pastry
and sweet apples, perhaps. Or a wallop of chocolate. It was
something clear and concise that told you it was time to get up
from the table and go home.
</P>
<P>
   But pastry chefs are being taken more seriously, with their
names on the menu and a celebrity quotient of their own. And their
patrons are going out to dinner in search less of sustenance than
of entertainment. The result: dessert has ballooned from a single
course to a banquet.
</P>
<P>
   Cello, a new restaurant on East 77th Street, leads diners into
dessert with a sorbet. The actual dessert follows, as does a whole
lot more: a petit four plate, a dish of chocolates and, with the
check, hot orange flower beignets. Cafe Boulud serves a similar
progression, starting with soup and ending with madeleines instead
of beignets.
</P>
<P>
   If you order the $93 fixed-price menu at March, you get sorbet
to start and almond pralines as a kicker, and in between a sampling
of three desserts off the regular menu. This sampling is also
available on the $68 menu. Eighty percent of diners order the
sampling, said Wayne Nish, the chef.
</P>
<P>
   Culinary schools are training the next generation to meet the
new demands. The French Culinary Institute in New York, for
instance, includes dessert composition, petits fours and tasting
plates in its curriculum. Pastry students are also required to dine
at restaurants and report back on the style and design of the
dessert menu.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the old days of the single dessert, Gramercy
Tavern's pastry chef, Claudia Fleming, said: ``I think when you
realize that nobody finished their desserts that you were very
limited in terms of your creativity. And for me the fun of eating
dessert is these little tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I had so many tiny courses at her restaurant,
working through a flavor spectrum starting with fruit and cream and
finishing with intense chocolate. Often, Ms. Fleming sneaks in
tasting plates, too, like permutations on apple _ an apple tart,
apple ice cream and an apple napoleon.
</P>
<P>
   At Union Pacific, diners can pay a supplement of $12 on the $65
fixed price menu for a ``flight of desserts.'' Three not-so-small
plates of dessert are delivered at once; as with a cheese plate,
the server describes the order in which to eat them. One evening, I
began with a peach goat cheese tart, moved on to a chicory bombe
with chocolate puff pastry ravioli and finished with a molten
chocolate cake. Temperatures flip-flopped from hot to cold to hot,
while the flavors progressed from sweet to smoky to bittersweet,
each richer than the next.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it was a bit much. By the time I got to the third
flight, the peanut butter ice cream on the chocolate cake was
melted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of this has to do with pastry chefs showing off
their range after a long period of time being stuck in the back
room,'' said Tish Boyle, an editor at Pastry Art and Design
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But all those sweets did make an impression that just one
dessert would not have. It was lavish and decadent, just the kind
of finale you feel you deserve from a top restaurant charging top
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Pastry chefs with less latitude may not be doling out as many
courses, but they are packing more onto a single plate. At Payard
Patisserie and Bistro, a tasting plate includes five pastries;
diners can choose their own. Oceana offers two samplers for an $8

SUSPECT REPORTEDLY ADMITS KILLING FOUR AT YOSEMITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA and PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A hotel handyman who reportedly told the
authorities that he killed a Yosemite naturalist and three tourists
said in an interview with a San Francisco television station that
he had dreamed about killing women for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am guilty,'' Cary Stayner, 37, told television station KBWB.
He said he killed three tourists _ Carole Sund, her daughter Juli
Sund and family friend Silvina Pelosso _ and naturalist Joie
Armstrong. ``None of the women were sexually abused in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview was aired Monday night, just hours after FBI
investigators said that Stayner, a resident handyman at the Cedar
Lodge just outside the Yosemite National Park, had confessed to
killing Armstrong, and law enforcement sources confirmed that he
had also admitted to the slayings of the Sunds and Pelosso.
</P>
<P>
   In the television interview, Stayner described killing Sund, her
daughter and Pelosso, a family friend from Argentina, in
mid-February and then how he killed Armstrong on July 21 near her
cabin just inside the Yosemite park.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner, who did not appear on camera, told the television
station that he strangled Pelosso and Carole Sund in their rented
cabin at the Cedar Lodge, then took Juli Sund to a lake, where he
killed her early the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   He said he abandoned their rental car with the bodies of Pelosso
and Carole Sund in it, returning two days later to burn evidence
and retrieve Carole Sund's wallet, which he dumped in Modesto to
confuse the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner told KBWB that he was the person who tipped the FBI to
the whereabouts of Juli Sund's body by sending an anonymous letter.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought he had gotten away with the crimes and did
not leave the area for fear of drawing attention to himself. That
changed when he met Armstrong last week and struck up a chance
conversation with her. He said he could not resist the urge to kill
her when he realized she was alone.
</P>
<P>
   To the victims' families, Stayner told KBWB, ``I am sorry their
loved ones were where they were when they were. I wish I could have
controlled myself and not done what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI agent Nick Rossi would not say whether Stayner's statements
to the television station were consistent with what he has told
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A court affidavit released Monday, signed by FBI agent Michael
Repucci, said Stayner admitted to investigators that he had killed
Armstrong, 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stayner provided details about the crime that are not
generally known outside law enforcement, and which corroborate his
confession,'' the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   That confession came at the same time the FBI said it had
discovered evidence linking Stayner to the killings of the Sunds
and Pelosso.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have developed specific information linking Stayner to the
Sund-Pelosso murders,'' James Maddock, head of the FBI's Sacramento
bureau, said Sunday. ``We believe that we have the responsible
party for all of these murders.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement sources said Stayner had confessed committing
all four slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund, 42, Juli Sund, 15, and Pelosso, 16, were last seen
on Feb. 15 at dinner at the Cedar Lodge in El Portal, just outside
Yosemite's southwestern entrance, where Stayner had worked and
lived for nearly two years. Carole Sund and Pelosso's remains were
found March 19 and Juli Sund's body was found March 25.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed in the killings of Sund and Pelosso.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was interviewed by agents in Sacramento after his arrest
at a nudist colony on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI reportedly also found incriminating evidence in
Stayner's apartment near the Yosemite National Park.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Stayner made his first court appearance in federal
court in Sacramento and was charged with killing Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Looking clean-cut and tan with a taut build, Stayner nodded as
U.S. Magistrate Judge Peter Nowinski read the charge against him in
connection with the Armstrong killing.
</P>
<P>
   Nowinski set the next hearing for Aug. 6 in federal court in
Fresno. At that time Stayner will likely enter a plea.

ASSESSING IMPACT OF NEW TARIFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Washington imposes 100 percent duties on an array of
European foods Thursday, as announced last week, the effect may be
less a bang than a ripple. The prices of Roquefort cheese, Dijon
mustard, tins of foie gras and fresh truffles could double. But for
the most part, it seems that the impact will not shake the consumer
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The tariffs, meant to pressure countries in the European Union
to lift a ban on American beef raised with hormones, apply to a
tangled shopping list of items. Foods as common as Dijon mustard
and rusks are affected, but so are preserved and prepared goose or
other liver products and juices made from one fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Nish, the chef and an owner of March restaurant, is upset
over the prospect of prices doubling for fresh truffles, especially
the white ones, which are starting to become available now. They
flavor and perfume up to a dozen dishes on his menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``We charge a $50 supplement for some of the dishes and we just
about break even,'' he said. ``But I don't think people will pay
$100.''
</P>
<P>
   Black truffles, which are also affected by the increase, can be
replaced with the frozen or canned variety.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared or preserved Italian, French and German tomatoes
(except any in vinegar) are also on the list, meaning the price of
San Marzano and sun-dried tomatoes could double in supermarkets and
for restaurateurs. Filled chocolate bars from France and French
lingonberry and raspberry preserves will also be subject to the
tariffs, along with French and German soups.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the other items, like fresh or frozen pork and beef
products used by food processors, are not sold directly to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Some stores, including Zabar's, say they will try to work with
suppliers to adjust prices so that the total increase is not passed
on to the consumer. But others, like Citarella, are taking a harder
line. ``If it's a 100 percent tariff we'll double the price,'' Joe
Gurrera, Citarella's owner, said.
</P>
<P>
   If Waldbaum's price of a 13.4-ounce jar of Maille mustard
imported from France goes from $3.06 to $6.12, as may eventually
happen once the jars now in the warehouse are sold, it won't be as
damaging to the food budget as a wedge of Roquefort.
</P>
<P>
   Roquefort may become such a high-end luxury it will no longer be
sold in supermarkets. At Zabar's, Papillon brand is $12.98 a pound
and Societe is $11.98 a pound. The store has stocked up on enough
for a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the suppliers or the manufacturers will arrange a
promotional discount so the price won't have to double,'' Olga
Dominguez, the cheese buyer for Zabar's, said.

   Petrossian expects prices on its truffled foie gras prepared in
France to increase as the tariffs are factored in. ``We took the
precaution of bringing in some extra stuff, but it won't hold us
through the holiday season,'' said Eve Vega, the company's director
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh white truffles that have Nish worried may not be
priced out of reach after all. In his head, Nish doubled last
year's prices, which ranged from $900 to $1,800 a pound, depending
on the quality.
</P>
<P>
   But last year was a poor season. Rosario Safina, an owner of
Urbani USA, an importer in Queens, N.Y., said this is expected to
be a very good year, with plentiful truffles selling for much less,
$600 to $800 a pound. After the duty is applied, the prices may not
be much higher than last year's.
</P>
<P>
   The increased tariffs are intended to offset the $116.8 million
lost annually by American beef producers because of the ban.
Intensive lobbying by importers got some high-profile products off
the original list published last spring, like bottled water and
prosciutto.

   Lang &AMP; Reed Cabernet Franc 1997, Napa Valley, Calif. About $18.
</P>
<P>
   Cabernet franc is the vinous equivalent of the decent guy in the
movies who never gets the girl. It's always there, but never seems
to rise to star status. One exception comes to mind: Chateau Cheval
Blanc, one of the most famous properties in St.-Emilion. The
magnificent wine of Cheval Blanc is invariably a blend of
two-thirds bouchet, which is what cabernet franc is called in that
part of the world, and merlot.
</P>
<P>
   Cabernet franc is also the grape in Bourgueil, Chinon and
Saumur-Champigny in the Loire Valley. Washington state has produced
some fine cabernet francs, and so has New York's Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   California has produced its share of good ones, but the wine has
yet to emerge as an important varietal. Lang &AMP; Reed, a new winery
in the Napa Valley, is among those hoping to create a new image for
the grape. Its version is worth trying. It has the intensity of a
good cabernet sauvignon, plenty of fruit and an intriguing bouquet,
but the structure is leaner and less complex. And it isn't marred
by too much oak. Unlike so many merlots, which can be mistaken for
cabernet sauvignon, this wine has its own attractive personality.

A THICKENER FROM SEAWEED  
 SORTING OUT VANILLA EXTRACTS  
 DRUGS IN SALMON  
 GUNPOWDER GREEN TEA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Q. I want to make vanilla pudding for a vegetarian friend, so I
cannot use gelatin, which contains animal products, as a thickener.
As a substitute, is agar-agar any better than cornstarch? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Agar-agar, which is also called kanten or Japanese gelatin,
is a flavorless dried seaweed usually sold in powder form or in
long strips or sheets. Dishes made with agar-agar will set and
remain firm without refrigeration.
</P>
<P>
   In a pudding, the difference between cornstarch and agar-agar is
one of texture.
</P>
<P>
   Cornstarch leaves puddings with an ever so slight gritty, floury
texture. (Think of packaged instant puddings, which are usually
cornstarch-based.). Agar-agar results in a wobbly, slightly
rubbery, Jello-like texture. It's really a matter of preference.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I know that pure vanilla extract is better than artificial,
but I have noticed differences in strength and flavor even among
pure vanillas. There is also a large price range among many brands.
What are the best? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Vanilla beans, and therefore vanilla extracts, vary greatly
in terms of quality and price.
</P>
<P>
   Extracts made from Madagascan beans are commonly considered the
best. Tahiti, too, produces superior, extremely aromatic beans.
Look for brands that list only vanilla and alcohol among their
ingredients; cheaper brands may be diluted with water.
</P>
<P>
   Penzey's Spice House, a mail-order source (414-679-7207), sells
a vanilla extract that uses twice as many Madagascan beans as
regular extracts, making it so intense that you should use half as
much as recipes call for. The extract, called Double Strength
Vanilla, is $9.95 for a four-ounce bottle. Penzey's also sells
Single Strength Vanilla, at $6.95 for four ounces.
</P>
<P>
   The Baker's Catalog (800-827-6836) offers Madagascan Bourbon
vanilla extract at $6.25 for four ounces.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, most specialty shops have a variety of fine
vanilla extracts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Zabar's (2245 Broadway, between 80th and 81st
Streets; 212-787-2000) sells Nielsen-Massey Madagascan Organic
Bourbon vanilla extract at $6.98 for a four-ounce bottle; a
four-ounce bottle of the company's Madagascan Bourbon extract, is
$4.98.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Since most salmon are farm-raised, how can one find out if
the fish have been fed hormone-laced or antibiotic feed?
</P>
<P>
   A. Fish farming in the United States is tightly controlled, and
the use of antibiotics and hormones is virtually nonexistent, said
Dr. Michael B. Timmons, a professor of agriculture and biological
engineering at Cornell University and the director of the Cornell
aquaculture program.
</P>
<P>
   Imported fish, however, are not subject to controls, and farmers
outside the United States may treat problems in their stock with
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Since fresh fish is not labeled, it is up to the customer to try
to find out where it came from. (The fishmonger should know.)
Besides salmon, tilapia and catfish are also farmed.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Recently, I received a box of Special Gunpowder China Green
Tea. Why is it called gunpowder? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Gunpowder green tea is drunk widely in China, and like all
green teas, it has a fresh, herbal flavor. It is made by rolling
dried green tea leaves into tight, tiny balls. This helps the tea
stay fresh and therefore retain its flavor longer than other green
teas.
</P>
<P>
   When boiling water is poured over the rolled pellets, they burst
open like flower buds, perfuming the brew.
</P>
<P>
   The tea's name is said to have come from a young British tea
trader, who, upon seeing the little tea pellets, decided they
resembled gunpowder.

SIMPLE COOKING: PUREEING A MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: recipes at end of article) 
 (bl)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the time of year when you can lose your mind buying fruit.
After so many months of barely acceptable produce, now the fruit is
marvelous and cheap, so naturally, when you stop at the farm stand,
you don't buy just one peach. You might just bring home a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   While everybody knows what to do with an excess of tomatoes
(make vats of sauce), a peach glut is a real problem _ unless you
learn to use fruit more creatively. Fruit purees, for instance, are
underappreciated in the home kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit purees are a staple of the restaurant kitchen, an
easy-to-make base for delicious and unusual sauces, dressings,
sorbets and other frozen desserts, and an all-purpose way to add
flavor to both sweet and savory dishes. It's impossible not to
appreciate something so versatile _ and so beautiful on the plate _
that takes just minutes to produce and requires no equipment beyond
a blender.
</P>
<P>
   With a little added butter or oil and fresh herbs, fruit purees
form the backbone of great sauces for meat or fish. They add
beguiling flavor to otherwise standard vinaigrettes. Add sugar and
a spice and, with the aid of an ice cream machine, they produce
four-star sorbets. (You can also make granitas with them or swirl
them into ice creams.) Fruit purees, sweetened, salted or otherwise
seasoned, make bright toppings for ice cream, cakes or cereal. Or
stir them into yogurt, enhance reductions or barbecue sauces or use
them as the basis of cold fruit soup.
</P>
<P>
   You can even freeze them as ice cubes to add flavor to iced tea
or mixed drinks. (Remember that although all the accompanying
recipes use specific fruits, you can experiment freely,
substituting one for the other without giving it much thought.)
</P>
<P>
   There are just two requirements for fruit that you intend to
turn into a puree. The first is that it be ripe, well ripe, even a
tad overly ripe. In fact, the puree is the first thing your mind
should turn to when confronted with the question ``What was I
thinking when I bought all these peaches?''
</P>
<P>
   The second is that the fruit should be easy to clean and, if
necessary, pit. Grapes, for example, will not do, nor will
cherries. Pits and skins must be removed before pureeing, and
fruits like these make that task formidable. Strawberries,
raspberries and blueberries are all good candidates, but if you
strain out the tiny seeds (and in the case of blueberries, bits of
skin) the puree becomes thinner and loses some bulk. More trouble
than it's worth, in my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The best fruits for pureeing are those that carry some weight. I
have had great success with the stone fruits: peaches, nectarines
and especially plums, which seem to become more assertive. Melons
also work well, especially firm cantaloupe, which is not too watery
and requires almost no effort whatsoever. And pineapple puree is
simply irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Making purees follows a predictable pattern. A stone fruit must
be peeled; do this by immersing it in boiling water for about 30
seconds, or until the skin loosens, then plunging it into ice water
to stop the cooking. At that point, the skin comes off easily with
a paring knife. Cut the fruit into halves or quarters, remove the
pits and it is ready for the blender.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, about a pound of fruit will produce just over a cup
of puree.
</P>
<P>
   Melons are even easier: cut them in half, remove the seeds and
scoop out the pulp with a spoon. A smallish melon, around two
pounds, yields about two cups of puree.
</P>
<P>
   Pineapples must be rid of all hard, prickly elements, which
takes some work. First cut off both ends. Stand the pineapple on
its broad end and cut it into quarters the long way. Cut off the
half-inch-wide band of woody material that runs along the long
angled edge of each quarter. Now remove the fruit from the skin;
it's easiest if you cut under it with a grapefruit knife. Cut the
meat into chunks.
</P>
<P>
   The pureeing itself takes a few minutes. Cram the fruit into the
blender, literally pushing it down onto the blades and squeezing
some of the water from it. This will help get the machine started
and should make it easy to puree the fruit without any intervention
or added liquid. If the machine is having trouble, turn it off and
use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to mash the fruit down onto
the blades.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit purees are stable, but their flavor is fleeting and
becomes less intense with every passing hour. Use them right away,
but if necessary, they can be refrigerated in a tightly covered
container for a day.
</P>

THICK, CRUSTY LAMB CHOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the second of eight columns by Waldy Malouf, the chef and
an owner of Beacon in Manhattan. His collaborator on these columns
is Melissa Clark.  
 By WALDY MALOUF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was growing up, one of my favorite dishes was leg of
lamb. It was a festive dish, one that my grandmother, who was from
Lebanon, made whenever we all gathered for a family celebration.
She would braise a whole leg with olives and lemon, and those
flavors, so wonderfully Mediterranean, are one of my earliest taste
memories. When I think of lamb, that dish instantly comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to recreate it at the restaurant, but I needed to cook
smaller portions, so they could be roasted to order, and I wanted
to expand on the flavors just a bit.
</P>
<P>
   I switched to thick triple lamb chops, because they are tender
enough to endure the kind of heat needed to get a nice crust. And
still thinking Mediterranean, I hit on the idea of adding capers
and anchovy to the olive-lemon marinade, making it almost a
tapenade.
</P>
<P>
   All these strong, salty ingredients may sound like a very
intense combination, but they really mellow as the lamb is roasted.
(We use a wood-burning oven, but a regular oven at a very high heat
will give most of the same results.)
</P>
<P>
   It's important to marinate the lamb at least four hours. During
that time, it is actually curing a little bit from the salt in the
olives, capers and anchovy. (You might notice that the marinade
doesn't call for any added salt; it just doesn't need it.) A mild
curing makes meat a little more tender, but more important, it
takes out water and concentrates fat, almost like dry aging. In the
end the chop has a moister and less grainy quality.
</P>
<P>
   At the very end of cooking, I deglaze the pan with wine, lemon
juice and stock (we use lamb stock, but you can use chicken or beef
broth), then toss in some thinly sliced lemons and more olives.
</P>
<P>
   The liquids quickly reduce and form a simple sauce. The lemon
slices and olives, which get nicely charred in the heat, add a
final burst of flavor and look beautiful on the plate. To keep the
Mediterranean mood, serve the chops with couscous or grilled
vegetables. A bright sprinkling of chopped parsley is all the
garnish you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   ROASTED TRIPLE LAMB CHOPS WITH OLIVES AND LEMON
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes, plus 4 hours to marinate
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons black oil-cured olives, pitted
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon capers
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chopped parsley, plus extra for garnish
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped shallot
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1 anchovy fillet
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 8-ounce, 3-bone racks of lamb, Frenched by butcher
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   \ cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   \ cup chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a food processor, combine olive oil, 1 tablespoon olives,
capers, parsley, garlic, shallot, cumin, anchovy and pepper. Coat
lamb with this marinade, and place in a bowl. Cover, and
refrigerate at least 4 hours, or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thinly slice lemon and remove seeds. Cut slices into
quarters. Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Arrange racks of lamb in a
roasting pan large enough to hold them in one layer (or use two
pans). Drizzle any marinade left in bottom of bowl over lamb. Roast
lamb 7 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Transfer lamb to a plate. Pour off fat from roasting pan, and
add white wine, chicken stock and lemon juice. Return lamb to pan,
browned side down. Sprinkle lamb with remaining olives and lemon
slices. Roast 7 to 9 minutes more, or to taste. Garnish with
chopped parsley, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

`DEEP BLUE SEA' LOOSES TERROR, BRAINY SHARKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
OUR RATING: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There have been ``Jaws'' with claws, paws and a
variety of different maws knockoff movies for a quarter century
now. ``Deep Blue Sea'' aspires to be ``Jaws'' with brains, and
while it's too conceptually ludicrous to make that grade, this is
one of the shrewder, more efficient terror machines that's followed
Spielberg into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Die Hard 2'' and ``Cliffhanger,'' director Renny Harlin's
most enjoyable movies, ``Deep Blue'' succeeds in spite of itself by
taking its outlandish story line absolutely seriously, yet somehow
proving that it has a sense of humor about the crazy thing. Expert
staging and shock cutting, not to mention the thoroughly convincing
animatronics and computer graphics that went into the movie's
awesome man-eating makos, put the show across.
</P>
<P>
   And the actors hold up their end, too, though they're hardly
required to operate at the high ``Jaws'' frequency. Saffron
Burrows, the British beauty from ``Circle of Friends,'' plays
obsessive researcher Dr. Susan McAlester. The daughter of an
Alzheimer's victim, she's developing a memory-preservant from shark
lobes (the predators' brain cells, we're told, don't deteriorate).
</P>
<P>
   A small crisis sends the wealthy industrialist who's bankrolling
the project, Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson), out to the
high-tech Pacific facility where the experiments are taking place.
Populating the isolated floating lab are fearless fish wrangler
Carter Blake (Thomas Jane), morally conflicted
cook-minister-alcoholic Preacher Dudley (LL Cool J), a couple of
other scientists (Stellan Skarsgard, Jacqueline McKenzie) and
engineer Todd Scoggins (Michael Rapaport).
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and three very fast, super-aggressive mako sharks that, in
her zeal, McAlester has genetically engineered to be about a
thousand times smarter than is, well, wise. With the inevitable bad
storm approaching, the thinking fish execute their plan to sink the
concrete research station, escape into the ocean and, as an extra
added bonus, dine on their creators.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frankenstein thought he had problems. ``Deep Blue's''
ever-dwindling human crew members have to wade through waterlogged
corridors, climb elevator shafts against falling, flaming debris,
and withstand hypothermia, pressure shifts and flash floods ... all
probably just to end up chomped anyway.
</P>
<P>
   One way Harlin and his writers, Duncan Kennedy and Donna and
Wayne Powers, keep things tense is by not following the usual
expendable casting formula, in which the least-known (or
least-paid) actors get killed before the starrier ones. You never
know who's going to survive a ``Deep Blue'' shark encounter; even
better, you often can't predict how.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in the same Baja water tanks where James Cameron shot
``Titanic,'' ``Deep Blue Sea'' is never less than an impressive
technical achievement, and for the most part it's a gripping, gory
good time. This ``Poseidon Adventure'' with teeth may not be the
thinking man's shark movie, but at least some thought went into
it. &QL;

QUESTIONS, CONCERNS SURROUND THE 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By Lowell Cohn   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Every year it's the same thing. We wonder
if this is the season the 49ers finally will drop out of the NFL
elite, becoming just another ordinary team. And every year, the
49ers embarrass the doubters by making it to the playoffs, although
lately the Super Bowl has been beyond their grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Here we go again. Once more the 49ers are a team loaded with
questions, except this season there are more than usual:
</P>
<P>
   _ Is the offense still a potent machine?
</P>
<P>
   This is a major question, although it's not the biggest
question. (The BIG ONE will be revealed later.) The standard
thinking is that with Steve Young, Terrell Owens, J.J. Stokes and
Jerry Rice, the 49ers always will score tons of points. In other
words, we're not supposed to worry about the offense.
</P>
<P>
   But that thinking is limited. Another way to phrase this
equation is to say the Niners have a great quarterback and three
fabulous receivers. And that's it. Period. End of story.
</P>
<P>
   In case you've forgotten, the 49ers need a running back. And the
reason is simple. When they didn't have a threat in the backfield
(See the Derek Loville Years), defenses piled on Young. He lost
confidence in himself and his offensive line, and he suffered
concussions and hurt his arm. So a running back like Garrison
Hearst keeps everything in balance and keeps Young alive.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that the Niners have the runner they need.
They've lost their top four backs from last season. Hearst is
seriously injured; Terry Kirby is gone and so is Chuck Levy.
General manager Bill Walsh traded fullback Marc Edwards, which made
several assistant coaches gag. Walsh replaced Edwards with Tommy
Vardell who is six years older and doesn't block as well. This is
troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Phillips is supposed to be the answer to the question
at tailback. Until now, all the talk about Phillips has focused on
the fact that he's a thug. (Oh, sure, he's allegedly become an
angel. Seeing is believing.) But his character is not the issue
here. His ability is.
</P>
<P>
   We already know he couldn't play for Dick Vermeil or Jimmy
Johnson. He was effective in college and Europe where he was
bigger, stronger and faster than the guys he played against. In the
NFL he isn't, which may explain why he's averaged only 3.3 yards
per carry.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Garner also will get time at tailback. He's a willing
contributor, but at 5-9 he's too small. He's a third-down back,
someone to catch a pass, to change the pace. And he's certainly not
the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Think about this. When Hearst went down, the Niners lost the No.
3 rusher in the league, and so far they have not improved
themselves at all, or even gotten back to where they were.
</P>
<P>
   _ How good is the offensive line?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is unknown. The 49ers have two holes to fill because
Kevin Gogan and Kirk Scrafford are gone. Derrick Deese, a perennial
replacement, will probably take over for Gogan at right guard. And
either Jeremy Newberry or Chris Ruhman will be right tackle, an
important position because this guy protects Young's back.
</P>
<P>
   In the past everyone could feel confident the line would come
together. That was because of coach Bobb McKittrick, the best in
the business. But McKittrick is seriously ill and may have limited
input in the game plan. Pat Morris, who coached the tight ends last
season, has taken over the line. We don't know if he's as good as
McKittrick. Which means there's yet anther question requiring an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do the 49ers have an adequate backup quarterback to Steve
Young?
</P>
<P>
   In a way this is an unfair question. Sure, the Niners would be
cooked without Young, but most teams die without their starting
quarterback. Having said that, it's important to point out that
last season the 49ers had Ty Detmer, a former starter, backing up
Young. This season the drop-off is steeper.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner for second banana seems to be Jeff Garcia, who
played well in Canada, but did not impress in mini-camp. Steve
Stenstrom played for Walsh at Stanford and was a fine college
quarterback. He must prove himself in the NFL. Jim Druckenmiller?
He'll be gone soon. At least he should be.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now we come to the big question, to the most important issue
facing the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Can the defense stop anyone?
</P>
<P>
   A positive answer here is crucial because defense wins ball
games. Remember all those great Joe Montana teams? Sure Montana was
special, but what made those teams consistent winners, what kept
the Niners in the game was the defense which consisted of guys like
Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright, Hacksaw Reynolds, Fred Dean, etc.
</P>
<P>
   So we start with the defensive line, and we notice that three
important contributors from last season are gone: Chris Doleman,
Roy Barker and, of course, Bryant Young, who may not return until
midseason. The loss of Young is particularly horrible because he
was San Francisco's best performer on defense, perhaps the best
player on the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Niners hope their No. 1 draft selection, tackle Reggie
McGrew, can pick up the slack because, quite simply, a team that
can't stop the run is in trouble. But McGrew missed mini-camps with
knee problems. They need him to be an impact player out of the
gate.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the issue of the pass rush. The 49ers were so
freaked about not having one that they signed Charles Haley. This
is highly scary. Not only because Haley has a tendency to go nutso,
but also because Haley has a bad back and could fall apart at any
second. End Gabe Wilkins should help now that his knee is healthy.
But he still has to prove himself on the field.
</P>
<P>
   _ Are the 49ers cornerbacks former Munchkins?
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't noticed, these guys are midgets. The
incumbents, R.W. McQuarters and Darnell Walker, are 5-9 and 5-8.
Walsh was concerned about having a couple of shrimps back there, so
he drafted two more corners, Anthony Parker and Pierson Prioleau.
Unfortunately, neither was impressive in mini-camp. After seeing
them, Walsh picked up Marc McMillian. He may be San Francisco's
best cover man, but he's only 5-7. You get the impression tall
receivers will go wild against the Niners secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Merton Hanks will again start at free safety. He was awful last
season, so much so that Walsh badmouthed him after taking over, and
said he'd cut Hanks from the squad. That never happened. Hanks
promised to do better this season.
</P>
<P>
   Tim McDonald returns at strong safety. He is really good.
Really, really good.
</P>
<P>
   The Niners linebackers are generally solid and above average.
Winfred Tubbs took over Gary Plummer's role last season but seemed
miscast. He has to show he can take on interior linemen and make
more tackles at the line of scrimmage. Oh, by the way, last year
Jim Mora coached the defensive backs. This year he's defensive
coordinator. That raises another obvious question: Is he ready?
Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the infighting at the ownership level affect the team?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. Last year, there was uncertainty about Eddie
DeBartolo Jr., Carmen Policy and Dwight Clark. But what went on
with them never bothered the team. In fact, the players couldn't
have cared less. So this year's Eddie/Denise soap opera should be a
non-issue.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   _ Can the team survive Bill Walsh's philosophy?
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his reign in San Francisco, George Seifert was
criticized for being shortsighted because he signed older free
agents. How was his strategy any different from Walsh's?
</P>
<P>
   We've seen Walsh go after Haley and Vardell, both moves of
desperation. He went after Phillips, not old, but troubled.
Phillips is someone Walsh wouldn't have touched in the past. Walsh
gives the impression of frantically trying to get back to the Super
Bowl while he still has Steve Young and Rice. Whether or not he can
succeed is anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   _ How good will the 49ers be?
</P>
<P>
   This is a tough one. In the areas where they're still good,
quarterback and wide receivers, the Niners are terrific. They play
in a weak division, and frankly, the NFC as a whole is no big deal.
How can it be with teams like the Lions, Redskins, Saints, Cowboys
and Eagles? So you figure the Niners can make the playoffs by
default.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they play road games in Jacksonville,
Arizona, Minnesota and Atlanta. They've not won an away game
against a team that finished with a winning record since 1996. So,
yes, there are questions.
</P>
<P>
   You could see the Niners ending up with a record of 8-8, or they
could win 13 games. But to do the latter, they'd need positive
answers to most of their questions, especially about cornerback,
defensive line (Haley in particular), and Phillips. My guess is
they'll win 11, and qualify for the playoffs.

JOAN BAEZ BATTLES HER WAY BACK TO THE LIMELIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MEG McCONAHEY   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Depending on the content, it can be deeply flattering to get an
advance reading of one's own elegy. Yet, for 58-year-old Joan Baez
_ still very much exercising her silky soprano in the studio and on
stage _ the very idea of being prematurely written off as a '60s
legend, made her angry.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``tantrum period'' is how Baez characterized, to one
interviewer, her high dudgeon at seeing contemporaries like Bob
Dylan celebrated with sellout performances before thousands, while
she foundered for a record label, air play and audiences.
</P>
<P>
   But Baez admits she wasn't entirely a victim. Not just asleep at
the wheel, she realized she wasn't driving her own career at all _
and neither was anyone else. It inevitably led to a personal crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago I realized I didn't fit in anywhere because I
wasn't paying attention musically,'' she said. ``I woke up and
realized, `Oh my God, what have I been doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Baez, who is halfway through a short summer tour, recently
reflected on her professional and personal reawakening, and the
vicissitudes of maturing, particularly in a business so
youth-driven that Ricky Martin, half her age, can wage ``a musical
comeback'' at the advanced age of 27.
</P>
<P>
   She recognizes that she and a lot of contemporaries who were
``riding the big golden train'' during the protest generation, when
politics and music fused into a powerful descant for the early baby
boomers, ``just didn't know how to deal with it,'' when the train,
as she says, ``rusted'' and slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   Baez, whose career had floated on ``handshake agreements,'' for
the first time hired a management company, and for her last album,
``Gone From Danger,'' she selected new music by up-and-coming young
songwriters like Richard Shindell and Ireland's Sinead Lohan, songs
that explored the personal struggle more than the political and
gave her a hipper sound without sacrificing her musical soul.
</P>
<P>
   She's even got her own Web site _ http://baez.woz.org. There's
the expected discography, bio information and tour schedule. But it
also shows a lighter side of the same woman who went to jail twice
for blocking the entrance to the Armed Forces Induction Center in
Oakland, Calif., and whose draft evasion remarks during taping led
to a preemption of the Smothers Brothers TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Now we can click onto vacation snapshots of a grinning Joan
hiking and fishing, ``load up the shopping basket'' with ``Gone
from Danger'' T-shirts, or catch up on chatty news _ from a plug
for her favorite Paris bistro, where her artwork adorns the walls,
to a recounting of her harrowing pulley ride with Bonnie Raitt, up
a 1,000-year-old redwood in Stafford, Calif., to visit and sing for
tree-sitter Julia Butterfly Hill, who has spent more than 500 days
in the tree to protest the logging of ancient redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exhilarating to be with Bonnie Raitt and have her look up
and say, `Oh s---. I'm going to hurl. Are we really going to do
this Baez?' '' she said, laughing at the memory.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, now that the sonorous folk singer, known as much for
her activism as her music, is tending more to her career, she seems
to be worrying less about the competition, not only from her
contemporaries but a new generation of female folk singers like
Sarah McLachlan and Cheryl Crow, for whom she paved the
professional way. Wising up, for Baez, has also meant loosening up
and letting go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I've grown up and come to my senses,'' said Baez, ``that
what could kill you revolves around jealousy and scrambling and
feeling inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to go on tour. I keep vacillating back and forth, and
thinking it's just time to go back and milk my goats,'' said Baez,
whose kick-back home life in Woodside, Calif., also revolves around
a big organic garden, two dogs, a flock of chickens, and time at
the easel and potter's wheel. ``But I love my band. And I love
being on the bus. Why stop now? In this industry you really have to
spot it with new albums and, if for no other reason than to keep
myself updated and feeling fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone from Danger'' was released in late 1997, and Baez said
she has another album forming in her mind but may still be another
six months away from the studio.
</P>
<P>
   If she's finally arrived at a certain comfort zone, Baez reveals
it was only after serious internal work. In truth, the unblenching
Folk Diva, who headlined at Woodstock and sang ``We Shall
Overcome'' before a quarter of a million people at the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic Washington rally in 1963, was
tormented by self-imposed demons, everything from panic attacks to
fear of flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just disguised it so well. I was such a cucumber on the
stage from the age of 18 ... I never really knew what it was like
to walk free on stage and just sing for the pleasure of it. I was
always under enormous pressure that mostly was my own.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of ``very deep therapy,'' running the gamut from
dance and painting to guided imagery and age regression, she says
she's ``out of the tunnel ... all the awfulness and lifelong
phobias are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The title of her last album, ``Gone from Danger,'' could speak
to her new ease, although the covers are clearly not party music.
There's Lohan's declaration of female independence, ``I'm No
Mermaid,'' ``February,'' Williams' achy poem to love misplaced, and
Betty Elders' ``Crack in the Mirror'' about child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers respectfully praised Baez for continuing her
career-long tradition of boosting the music of unknowns, something
she did decades ago with Phil Ochs, Tim Hardin, Eric Andersen and
Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   But Baez also knows she has something to learn, reflecting a
humbleness that comes with maturity and hard lessons. ``There are
these kids writing this stuff now, and it's good. What really
interests me now is the younger generation.''
</P>
<P>
   She also is careful to graciously mention her younger band
members _ guitarist Adam Kirk, who toured with Lohan; bass player
Mark Peterson; violin, mandolin and sax player Joshua Segal, a
member of The Borrowers, who toured with the Indigo Girls; and
percussionist Carol Steele.
</P>
<P>
   Right now she has a particular interest in one protege, niece
Pearl Bryan, who is touring with her and for whom she will do
back-up vocals on a couple of numbers. She said the 26-year-old
concealed her prodigious vocal gift from everyone, including her
own mother, Baez's older sister Pauline. But the Earth Aunty of
folk discovered it by chance when she invited the younger woman to
come live with her during a difficult time. Baez at first thought
the sweet voice filtering through a closed door was the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her, `You want to sing?' She said, `Yeh.' I said,
``Let's go upstairs and play the guitar and sing something.' And
she has been singing since.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Remaining dates in this tour: 7/28/99, Bozeman, Mont.;

<P>
   For vegetables, they are a motley crew. One looks like a pale
green hand grenade. Another is a dark curlicue as gnarled as a
ram's horn. There are lemony spheres and skinny wands, ivory
torpedoes and tiny, spiny ovoids like stretched golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   These unlikely specimens are all cucumbers, but not the usual,
reticent vegetables that achieve their greatest moments only after
a bath in brine. Like a bunch of shy eggheads masquerading as a
motorcycle gang, these are cucumbers transformed into shocking
characters, yet they retain the essential cucumber qualities of
crispness and coolness.
</P>
<P>
   With subtle alterations in taste, crunch and texture, they
simply do the job better than the familiar hulking waxed behemoths.
And more than likely, they have moved into your neighborhood.
Produce specialists like Gourmet Garage and Agata &AMP; Valentina are
carrying them, and so are some supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   The cucumber encroachment began in New York Greenmarkets. For
years, farmers have been selling lemon cucumbers, which look
surprisingly like lemons yet are unmistakably cukes, and any number
of Asian specimens, which vary considerably in the thickness of
their skin, the springiness or firmness of their texture and in
their seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their appearance, these cucumbers are more intensely
flavored than the ordinary, watery ones and, at $1.50 to $3 a
pound, cost just a little more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I managed the Greenmarket for 15 years, and I've seen them for
15 years,'' said Jay Petraker, who is now buys the produce for the
Gourmet Garage chain. He said their popularity is growing as people
become aware of them, just as arugula, once an obscure green,
became a salad regular.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs have certainly discovered them. ``What I think is really
wonderful is that they're very dense, and they've got great
texture,'' said Peter Hoffman, the chef and owner of Savoy in
Manhattan, who makes his own pickles and uses unconventional
cucumbers for a salad with cold marinated halibut.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Batali of Po and Babbo in Greenwich Village has embraced
them even more fervently. ``I love the cucumbers,'' he said. ``They
have great flavor, great texture.'' Batali juices cucumbers to make
a broth for fish, and shaves remarkably clean-tasting lemon
cucumbers over baccala, the Italian salt-cod dish.
</P>
<P>
   Asian cucumbers have always been available in Chinatown markets.
Others, like the lemons, are heirloom varieties, which were shunted
aside by the waxy torpedoes in the battle for market supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   David Size of Heirloom Harvest Farms in Blairstown, N.J., who
sells Asian, lemon and even Jamaican cucumbers, says they don't
need special treatment. Like all cucumbers, the spiny ones can be
eaten with the skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you refrigerate them, they have the same storage and
shelf-life characteristics as regular cucumbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with any cucumber, though, is that
ultimately it is simply a cucumber. ``It doesn't get the respect of
a tomato,'' Petraker said. ``It doesn't get the respect of a
dripping peach.''
</P>
<P>
   In Asian kitchens, however, it has always been part of hot and
cold dishes. Petraker's brother, Joel Petraker, the assistant
director of the greenmarket program, has observed the cultural
cucumber divide at his own dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my mother-in-law from Korea, cucumbers are right up
there,'' he said. ``To my Jewish mother from Long Island, they're
something you pick out of your salad.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Cho, the chef and owner of Bo, a Korean restaurant in
Flushing, Queens, adds Asian cucumbers to her kimchi, makes pickles

 &HT;    Fair jurist generated moral force in South
 &HT;    By Jack Bass
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was curious about why Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the editor
for my biography of Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr., felt so intensely
about him. When I asked how she became interested, she leaned back
reflectively at her desk at Doubleday, then said, ``He's long been
a hero of mine. I guess it goes back to the White House and hearing
Jack and Bobby talk about him.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest federal judge in the nation when appointed by
President Eisenhower in 1955 a few days before his 37th birthday,
Johnson stoically endured death threats, cross burnings, a bombing
of his mother's home in the belief it was his, and social
ostracism.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 15 years, federal marshals provided him with
round-the-clock protection. His civil rights rulings helped
transform the South and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He changed Alabama, guiding the state he loved to move beyond
the legacy of George Wallace, his former law school classmate and
friend. It changed so much that at the dedication a few years ago
of the Frank M. Johnson Jr. Federal Building and Courthouse in
Montgomery, a legislator presented a unanimous resolution praising
Congress for putting his name on the building. Twenty-five years
earlier, the Legislature had called for Johnson's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ``Judge Johnson gave true
meaning to the word `justice.' '' Wallace said he needed ``a barbed
wire enema.'' Before his death, however, Wallace told me that in
the long run he was ``wrong'' on segregation and Johnson was
``right.''
</P>
<P>
   His rare combination of strength, courage, integrity, intellect
and wisdom generated a powerful moral force. Judge Johnson made the
rule of law prevail during a period of violent upheaval. He took
literally his oath of office to ``administer justice,'' which he
came to define as the absence of injustice. In Alabama, he issued
orders desegregating schools and a host of other facilities,
striking down barriers to voting and serving on juries, breaking
new ground in gender discrimination and First Amendment issues, and
extending constitutional protection to abused inmates and state
mental patients.
</P>
<P>
   Although his orders helped transform the social order in the
South, Johnson never viewed matters before him as societal issues.
To him they were always legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   When I first interviewed him, in 1974, he explained, ``When you
have a voting rights case and you find that there's been a pattern
and practice of discrimination against the blacks in registering to
vote, you don't register the blacks to vote so that they can gain
political power. You are faced with some legal issues, and if they
are entitled to relief, you give them relief and you order that
they be registered. Now the effect of their registering and voting
and electing a sheriff and other county officials is something that
the court's not concerned with, and has no interest in it. The role
federal judges have played in the South has been one of effecting
resultantly a social change. And there's no question about it. But
that wasn't the motive and it wasn't the purpose and it wasn't the
intent.''The Republican ``Southern strategy'' kept him off the
Supreme Court. His friend, Chief Justice Warren Burger, once called
Johnson in from a fishing trip in the Gulf of Mexico to tell him
President Nixon was appointing
</P>
<P>
   him to succeed Justice Hugo Black. Years later, a contrite
Alabama congressman told Johnson that he and the state's two other
Republican representatives learned about it and told Attorney
General John Mitchell such an appointment would hurt them
politically. The congressman told the judge, ``We made a mistake
and I want to apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson addressed his own legacy in a 1980 interview with Bill
Moyers. ``I realize that a good many people here in this section of
the country were dissatisfied with some of the constitutional
decisions that I found it necessary to make,'' he said. ``But ... I
gained a reputation among a large majority of the people in this
section of the country, that Judge Johnson's tough, Judge Johnson
will rule the way he sees the Constitution, but there's always one
thing _ that he's fair. And that's the only reputation that a judge
can hope to get. And that's the only kind of a reputation he ought
to want.''
</P>
<P>
   They buried Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr. Tuesday in his native
Haleyville in mountainous Winston County, a Unionist stronghold
during the Civil War. I once drove the four hours there from
Montgomery with him. As the terrain became more rugged, he said
softly, ``I always enjoy coming to the hills.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll endure, as will his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Bass wrote ``Taming the Storm: The Life and Times of Judge
Frank M. Johnson and the South's Fight over Civil Rights,'' which
won the 1994 Robert F. Kennedy Book Award.

`DEEP BLUE SEA': LAB SHARKS TURN MEN INTO SUSHI 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So much water leaks, gurgles, sloshes and jets through Renny
Harlin's waterlogged man-versus-shark horror epic ``Deep Blue Sea''
that when it comes to choosing the season's strongest, sturdiest
most absorbent paper towel of a movie, there's no just contest;
this one takes the prize. Think of it as cinematic Mega-Brawny with
a familiar horror-movie message: Don't mess with Mother Nature or
she'll turn on you.
</P>
<P>
   The liquid that this product sops up isn't just ordinary sea
water. It's water frequently thickened and made crimson with human
blood, as three genetically ``improved'' 8,000-pound mako sharks
viciously turn against the staff of the Aquatica Research
Laboratory, a gleaming multilevel station floating in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Enter a bogus tropical storm that causes a helicopter crash that
sets the place on fire and destroys most of its power, and the
tables are suddenly turned. The evil researchers become little
fishes toyed with and then devoured by their laboratory subjects
one by one. The sharks' favorite mode of attack is to leap up out
of the water like giant, demented razor-toothed porpoises, seize
their prey and dispose of them in two or three quick chomps. A
relentless shock-effect soundtrack supplies the clanging audio
equivalent of shark growls, along with many nerve-jangling false
alarms.
</P>
<P>
   The most villainous human, Dr. Susan McAlester (Saffron
Burrows), is a beautiful, icy marine biologist whose scientific
hanky-panky involves implanting human brain tissue in creatures
that the movie redundantly insists many times are the most
efficient killing machines in all of natural history. Although
Susan's work is supposed to hold the key to curing degenerative
brain diseases like Alzheimer's, exactly how it relates to medical
science is never addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Susan's upper-class English accent is one sign that she is too
ruthlessly ambitious to be trusted. Still, you've got to hand it
her. She's got nerve. Late in the movie, she deliberately slashes
her hand and dives into the ocean, offering herself as live bait
for one of the monsters so it will come close enough for her fellow
survivor, Carter Blake (Thomas Jane), a self-proclaimed ``shark
wrangler,'' to kill it. As Susan slides into the water, she
foolishly challenges the fish to ``come to mama.''
</P>
<P>
   The most courageous character is Carter, a muscular daredevil
with a shady criminal past, whose idea of fun is grabbing onto a
killer shark's fin and taking an underwater ride. For comic relief
there's the house chef, Preacher (LL Cool J), who after watching
his beloved foul-mouthed pet parrot become a shark snack flees into
a giant oven with the gas turned on. In a movie that's generically
self-referential, Preacher comments bleakly on his probable fate by
observing that his black brothers are usually killed off early in
movies of this type.
</P>
<P>
   Other stars whose characters the movie barely bothers to define
include Michael Rapaport as the lab's engineer, Stellan Skarsgard
as its physician and Samuel L. Jackson as its chief financial
backer, who chooses exactly the wrong moment to fly in for an
inspection. Jacqueline McKenzie plays a character so vague she
might best be described as the movie's extra (and most disposable)
woman.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of ``Deep Blue Sea'' follows a dwindling core of
survivors from the accident as they struggle to make their way from
the bowels of the research station to the surface before the
structure sinks and without being eaten alive. Imagine a cut-rate
``Titanic'' (``Deep Blue Sea'' is filled with scenes of flooding
corridors) stripped of romance and historical resonance and fused
with ``Jaws,'' shorn of mythic symbolism and without complex
characters, and you have the essence of this live-action horror
comic.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in its dumb, bludgeoning way, it's fun. To quote the ever
voluble Preacher who makes it to the surface barely in one piece:
``Bring me some sushi!''

TIGERS HURLER PITCHING WEB PAGE TO HIS FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Detroit Tigers pitcher C.J. Nitkowski leaves major-league
baseball, he should have one pitch remaining in his repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   He could convince someone that he'd make a good Webmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Nitkowski, who has a 3-5 record for the Tigers, is the only
known major-league baseball player to operate his own Web site
(www.cjbaseball.com).
</P>
<P>
   It's not one of those sites created for the players by a hotshot
Internet company _ you know, the ones where a player personally
responds to e-mail on a standard form. And it's not one of those
tribute sites created by someone with a case of hero worship.
</P>
<P>
   Nitkowski actually created his own site _ not as a vanity
exercise, but as a way to interact with his fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be good for my fans _ and it has been,''
said Nitkowski, who taught himself HTML (hypertext markup language,
Internet coding). ``It's the e-mail that keeps it going for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nitkowski started his site in September 1997 when he was
pitching for the Houston Astros. In January, he was traded to the
Tigers _ a move that generated more than 300 e-mails from his fans.
</P>
<P>
   He also built traffic through an 11,000-member Astros newsletter
that he authored. During the '98 season, the site received more
than 43,000 hits, Nitkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Now in Detroit, Nitkowski has improved his Web skills, and the
site is taking shape. He also bought Web-authoring software and a
digital camera (his best photo comes from his motel room in St.
Louis,where he can't believe how close the hotel is to Busch
Stadium).
</P>
<P>
   He updates his site several times a week or ``when I can,'' said
Nitkowski, who no doubt mulls his site's changes while he's in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   His best updates offer an inside look at the team or his
performances.
</P>
<P>
   One of those inside stories is Nitkowski's suspension letter
from American League president Gene Budig.
</P>
<P>
   Nitkowski posted a scanned image of the letter along with his
response to a May 22 incident in which Nitkowski threw inside to
Cleveland's Kenny Lofton after a warning had been issued to both
teams. In a reply letter, Nitkowski pleaded his case. In a
subsequent letter, Budig thanked Nitkowski and returned the $500
fine that Nitkowski was assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Nitkowski also posts tips on getting players' autographs,
reviews of his favorite restaurants on the road (including two in
Arlington), reviews of his favorite golf courses and his favorite
Web-site links.
</P>
<P>
   The site is not too high-tech _ no polls, chats or fancy gizmos.
Nitkowski said he doesn't foresee himself getting too fancy with a
site that he believes is user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going overboard here,'' he said. ``I don't plan on
taking my Internet talents much farther. But you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   VIRTUAL HOT DOGS, TOO? MSNBCSports.com is taking users on a
virtual interactive tour through the top ballparks in the major
leagues. MSNBC rates the best five parks overall, best in the works
and best new ballparks. The site includes audio commentary by Bob
Costas. Fans of The Ballpark in Arlington will be disappointed to
find out it's not included.

   VIDEO CHAMP: Cowboys linebacker Randall Godfrey's chat on
NFL.com last week revealed his passion for video games: ``Once we
hit camp, that's all we'll do with our spare time, so I've got to
be ready. Who's the team champ? Me, of course. Some of these young
guys are good, though, so I look forward to playing some of them.''

 &HT;    HELP FOR NEW TEACHERS CUTS DEPARTURE RATE
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One in 11 newly hired teachers quits before
finishing the first year and must be replaced, disrupting the
education of students and exacerbating teacher shortages.
</P>
<P>
   But that 9.3 percent dropout rate falls to 7 percent in urban
districts that create a formal support system for novice teachers,
says a study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said the new-teacher programs they examined in
118 city and large-town school districts in 35 states ranged from
``comprehensive to cursory.'' Most depended heavily on mentoring of
the newcomers throughout their first year by specially trained
veteran teachers, who coached them on everything from paperwork to
classroom management and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly in urban districts, it helps (to counteract) the
so-called reality shock as they encounter the problems of real
students in a real classroom,'' said lead researcher Elizabeth F.
Fideler, executive vice president of Recruiting New Teachers Inc.,
a national, nonprofit, teaching development organization in
Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies showed that only 56 percent of teachers in the
typical public school district _ and about 60 percent in the urban
districts, which often present the greatest teaching challenges _
obtain formal help in their first year, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers who make the transition from novice to seasoned
professional too often do so by navigating solo through uncharted
waters,'' Fideler said. ``Contrast that to the experience of
medical residents, law associates and even rookie basketball
players, who are required to go through extended training,
development and mentoring'' after they are hired.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, she and David Haselkorn concluded that
formal first-year programs ``improve new teachers' knowledge skills
and performance, provide personal support, introduce new teachers
to school system norms and procedures, and familiarize them with
school system values.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, they also found that programs for
first-year teachers come and go as budget levels shift and that few
districts measure the impact of the programs on those teachers'
students.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the nation's two largest teachers unions hailed the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The National Education Association endorsed mandatory support
systems for new teachers earlier this month, said its president,
Bob Chase. ``As educators and policy makers, we ought to channel
all the resources we can to help new teachers to not just survive
their first year of teaching, but to thrive and succeed in their
most important charge _ boosting student achievement,'' Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Baratz-Snowden, deputy director for education issues at the
American Federation of Teachers, said, ``Part of the problem is
many states have legislation (encouraging such programs), but in
some states it's not mandated, and in others, it is mandated, but
it's not funded.''
</P>
<P>
   Most programs are funded by local districts themselves, because
fewer than 20 states fund them, the researchers found. Sen. Jack
Reed, D-R.I., on Tuesday introduced a bill that would offer $1
billion annually in federal subsidies for professional development
of teachers in districts with the highest number of poor students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislation will fund mentorship programs for new teachers
and training for mentor-teachers to ensure they have the skills to
help those teachers,'' Reed said. It would include funds to hire
substitutes to handle the classes of mentors and novices who are
conferring.

CELEBRITY DEATHS CREATE COMPARATIVE GRIEVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday, Aug. 3)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Celebrities die as differently as they live from ordinary people
and are mourned in a separate fashion.
</P>
<P>
   It began within 24 hours following the announcement that John F.
Kennedy Jr. was missing and presumed dead. People started talking
about whether they felt worse about losing him or Princess Di.
</P>
<P>
   When Uncle George dies, you don't hear someone comparing the
tragedy of his train wreck to Cousin Mal's skiing accident.
</P>
<P>
   But with a celebrity death there's comparative grieving. Who
affected the public the most? Even before the bodies were found
came the headline: ``Cable ratings beat Di coverage,'' with a
report showing that the Kennedy death coverage edged out not only
the death of Princess Diana but the Littleton High School
massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, I met some people at a campground who had
been without TV, newspapers or radio for days. The last they heard
before packing off into the wilds was that Kennedy's plane had
disappeared and that he, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and
her sister, Lauren Bessette, were feared dead.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, this band of uninformed campers was still in the
first stage of breaking news, stunned and sad and shaking their
heads in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Having missed the media aftermath, they were fresh in their
sorrow, like we had been on that first day.
</P>
<P>
   The world had moved on for those keeping the Kennedy watch.
Within days, we were approaching information overload. In less than
a week we had gone from shock to near-saturation.
</P>
<P>
   It was predictable, though. There are stages of public mourning
that seem to attend the sudden death of celebrities, especially
those who are rich, famous and wonderful to look at.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately upon hearing that the famous person has died or is
presumed dead, we start seeing file photos of them in happy days.
The first photos are heartbreaking but they become sadly routine
after a few days. Sometimes something will appear from old
videotape or film archives that show the person in scandalous days,
although the media usually hold back for a time. However, if a
member of the competition chooses not to be respectful, they all
succumb.
</P>
<P>
   Following file photos, sound bites and film clips comes
commentary. The media search high and low, but not too far, for any
friend, co-worker or family member several in-laws removed to speak
of the deceased. Real friends and family members don't talk to the
media right away because they simply cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Find the local angle. This is when newspapers, big and small,
across the country beat the bushes to find anyone in their
circulation area who might have once known the deceased, went to
boarding school with them, attended a party in the same apartment
building, sold them gas when they drove through town.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they score with a nice little anecdote. Often they
bomb and have to turn to some guy at the mall willing to share his
favorite memories of a person he never met.
</P>
<P>
   No news is more news. This is the period when there is nothing
more to report, at least for the time being. Special sections and
TV documentaries are being hastily assembled and meanwhile the
daily update is all of the above, over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has a theory. Experts talk about how a plane might have
crashed into the Atlantic, a car into a tunnel on a Paris street.
Many people usually not asked for their input get to hold press
conferences. Valuable TV time is filled with how altimeters work.
</P>
<P>
   Economic impact. This is when it gets a little weird, when
stories emerge like how news of the death of the famous person
affected the Saturday night ticket sales at the local movie
theater. And what kind of memorial T-shirts and ceramic figurines
you can buy on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Spite and resentment. Some begin to hint that it might have been
the deceased's fault. Some whisper mean-spirited things about the
famous dead person and reveal general bitterness toward anyone with
fame, wealth, beauty, education, social status and special
privilege. They snipe about the cost of investigating the famous
person's death. Some even make rude remarks and jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Saturation. Finally, the listening and reading public starts to
grumble for something else on the nightly news and the front page.
They blame the media for overindulging their endless curiosity.
They say they are tired of the frenzy and the circus, and on this
point the public mourners are finally in sync with the grieving
family.
</P>
<P>
   Once the world stops mourning, the families can. They can grieve
the way that families do when someone loses his daughters and
someone loses her sisters and someone her brother. Vanished people
who were someone's somebody. Not everyone's somebody.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: What I saw in Warsaw, 10 years
later
 &HT;    (With photos.)
 &HT;    (Eds: Cox News Service columnist Joe Murray reported from
Eastern Europe during a visit 10 years ago, just before the fall of
the Berlin Wall. This summer he returned to write about the changes
that have led three former Eastern Bloc countries to become the
newest members of NATO _ Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW _ Ten years ago, when Eastern Europe was still
semi-Soviet in the last months before the fall of the Berlin Wall,
I had to sneak into Warsaw with a tourist visa, scared silly that
someone would spot me for the journalist I am.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that silliness must have carried over, even though
nowadays the namesake of the erstwhile Warsaw Pact is one of our
newest NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   There I was, my first evening in Warsaw, dining with a
journalist friend at a French restaurant that was everything anyone
could ask for, in Warsaw or wherever ...
</P>
<P>
   And what I meant to tell the waiter was that I wanted gazpacho.
It came out instead:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have the Gestapo.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. You can take the boy out of the country, but be
careful which countries you put him into.
</P>
<P>
   Purpose of my trip was to revisit cities where I traveled in
1989, Warsaw, Prague and Budapest, what was then Eastern Bloc and
today are European democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays you shoot through customs with a wave of your American
passport. Ten years ago you felt like you might be shot just for
being an American.
</P>
<P>
   As the millennium nears, Warsaw is a city surprising itself with
its own prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles south of the central city, in an area of empty
fields a year ago, malls, supermarkets and even warehouse-style
superstores serve as glittering mile markers on Poland's road to
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Just watch out you don't get run down.
</P>
<P>
   Cart traffic is dangerous along the gleaming aisles, as shoppers
rush from one announced special to another, a free-market
free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   It's a risk worth taking for a country that once got along
mainly on sausage, cheese and a bit of bread layered in between for
variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have but one choice of yogurt,'' a woman shopper
exclaimed. ``Now there's an entire shelf of different yogurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget borscht. Think barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   BBQ grills, utensils, briquettes, cans of lighter _ everything
you need for an outdoor cookout is on sale, plus an array of patio
furniture. With roast beef priced at about $1.50 a pound, it's
dining out at its cheapest.
</P>
<P>
   Not that barbecue is really all that new to Poland. If anything,
it's a return to an ancient way of life, Poles say.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, they called it roasting an ox.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all is Neiman and Marcus in the making.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown flea market _ a village of kiosks called ``Jaws''
because of the steel grates that secure them at night _ is where
most of Warsaw everyday folks shop, though not necessarily by
choice.
</P>
<P>
   The price may be right, but you get what you pay for _ fake
designer goods and pirated CDs _ and if you're not careful, your
pocketbook or purse may be snatched in the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   This is the complaint you hear, that between the flea markets
and the limited selection of expensive designer shops, there's not
much in between. That's where the strength of Poland's economy,
like that of any democracy, lies _ in the middle class, newly
emerging.
</P>
<P>
   And all those cell phones you see aren't necessarily signs of
affluence. In a city where it may take a year to get a line
installed in your home, a cell phone often is the only phone that's
quick and easy to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   Polish currency, the zloty, enjoys what seems to be a
respectable rate against the dollar, about four for a buck. But
outside Poland, the zloty isn't worth diddly to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that the hard way, that their money isn't on par with
hard currency. I had about $100 worth of zlotys when I left Poland,
only to discover that you can't trade them in neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But I shouldn't complain. Ten years ago when I was here I got my
pocket picked. At least this is more businesslike.

 &HT;    Sight of dead man in whale tank chilled sheriff's deputies
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Daniel Dukes lived anonymously but died
famously.
</P>
<P>
   The world notices when you're found dead at an Orlando theme
park on the back of a killer whale.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning of July 6, SeaWorld trainers discovered a
scene with front-page sizzle and made-for-TV potential.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Captain Ahab, who went down in a violent ocean lashed to
Great White Moby Dick, Daniel Dukes was draped over the back of a
shiny-black killer whale in a stark, concrete pool at the deserted
theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Who would jump in a pool with a 5-ton animal that could make
short work of the biggest shark?
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old drifter's family apparently can't explain _ and
if they have any insights, they're not saying. Dukes' parents, who
own a Columbia, S.C., real estate business, have had little contact
with their son for the past 10 years _ and no contact with the
press.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes spent most of the past decade in Austin, Texas, compiling
a rap sheet of arrests for bizarre crimes including stealing a
Barbie doll, briefcase and women's camisole from a Target store;
clocking a fellow patron in the head at Joe's Generic Blues Bar;
and breaking into a home where he was discovered resting in a
downstairs bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Court records list an employer as a ``C Thru U Productions,''
which no longer exists and perhaps never did.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was unremarkable enough that a parole officer assigned
to Dukes' case does not remember him. And workers at Austin
homeless shelters recognize photographs of Dukes, but can recall
almost nothing about him.
</P>
<P>
   After being released from jail on the assault charge last fall,
Dukes headed to Florida and was arrested for possession of a
marijuana joint on Christmas Day in Marion County. In March he was
arrested in Volusia County for resisting arrest without violence.
</P>
<P>
   By April, though, he found his way to Coconut Grove, where he
turned up at the Hare Krishna Temple for the weekly Sunday feast
that's open to all.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived with a knapsack and a suitcase containing leather
chaps and a cowboy hat. He frequently carried a notepad and wrote
notes to try to convince people he couldn't speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if something important happened,'' says Krishna member
Cakrapani, ``he'd talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Keshava Swami, the leader of the Coconut Grove temple, wouldn't
tolerate the silent act and told Dukes to speak or leave. He spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes spent about two months, off and on, at the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Among his possessions found at SeaWorld: a picture of Lord
Juggernaut, who, Hindu beliefs say, saved a village from a whale
terrorizing the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes took in the shows
</P>
<P>
   Dukes _ a thin man with stringy, dirty-blond hair, a bum's beard
and blue eyes _ broke from anonymity when he visited SeaWorld.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives working the case say Dukes spent one night in heavy
landscaping near the SeaWorld entrance, making a small camp that
included a Hare Krishna shrine (with items he stole from the
temple's gift shop). He saw the dolphin show and stingray show,
took a few snapshots _ mostly of obese women and dolphins _ and
played in the arcades.
</P>
<P>
   And then some time after dark on his second night in the theme
park, unnoticed on a surveillance monitor watched by SeaWorld
security, Dukes slipped off his pants, shirt and shoes and jumped
into a 52-degree saltwater pool. It was the home of Tilikum, a male
breeding whale, the largest in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes' act shocked everyone in Orange County's death business.
And accustomed as they are to shootings, stabbings, beatings, car
wrecks and headers off high-rises, they don't shock easily.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Solomons of the Orange County Sheriff's Department arrived
quickly that morning at SeaWorld.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to hundreds of crime scenes the 14 or so years I've
been doing this,'' said the public information officer. ``I'm
usually pretty stoic.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Solomons thought Tilly had a tumor as it swam toward
him. ``I'm standing next to a fireman and a couple of our
detectives and I went, `Holy sh--, that's a naked guy.' I said it
out loud. I've never been affected that way. It was like a fireman
would carry a victim out of a burning building.''
</P>
<P>
   Killer whales, said to be smarter than dolphins, have been known
to hoist humans on their backs to save them from drowning.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers had no problem getting the willing whale to swim to a
scale, flop out of the water and let two petrified firemen remove
Dukes.
</P>
<P>
   And then the whale, calm and precise, slid back into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shashi Gore, Orange County's chief medical examiner for 30
years, said he had never seen a death as weird.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen death from hypothermia but not in a whale tank,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has several theories about how Dukes died: When he hit the
water, he immediately went into hypothermic shock as he shivered
and expended valuable energy. Add to that panic, fear, and
flailing, and hypothermia would be quick and deadly. And at
5-feet-11 and about 150 pounds, Dukes was no endurance athlete. He
probably didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   While people can survive four to five hours fully clothed in
frigid water, even the U.S. Coast Guard won't venture a guess as to
how long a nearly naked person could last.
</P>
<P>
   Gore guesses Tilly, a territorial animal, probably moved quickly
to check out the visitor. The animal _ with huge, white,
mound-shaped teeth _ scratched Dukes as it removed his green
shorts, possibly attracted to the color. There was also bruising,
which leads the medical examiner to believe Tilly may have flipped
and tossed Dukes like one of the giant balls pitched in the pool by
trainers during playtime.
</P>
<P>
   Tilly, though, didn't break bones or bite. Killer whales swallow
food whole and are not known to attack humans. Maybe, Gore guesses,
a panicked and freezing Dukes got caught underneath the huge
animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fatigue leads to drowning,'' explains Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Called childlike, harmless
</P>
<P>
   At the tranquil Coconut Grove Hare Krishna Temple, Keshava, a
52-year-old former engineer from Rio de Janeiro, listens to the
details of Dukes' demise. As a Krishna swami, he's in charge of the
Miami temple, which has a staff of 30 and about 1,000 followers. He
had to give the OK for Dukes to stick around the compound doing odd
jobs from April through late May.
</P>
<P>
   The Krishnas, practicing a 5,000-year-old Hindu religion, don't
take in the homeless because it leads to problems. But Keshava says
Dukes was so childlike, so harmless, that he could have stayed as
long he wanted if he followed minimal rules and did minimum work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came here, he started by washing the pots,'' said
Keshava, pointing into the cafeteria to the small, sweltering
kitchen. Then he smiled and mentioned the time Dukes replaced the
meditation music normally played on the kitchen boombox with a
Metallica tape. At the sight of Keshava in the doorway, he quickly,
sheepishly, returned the meditation music.
</P>
<P>
   People in Austin say Dukes may have become interested in Eastern
religions when he was taken in by a man who frequently sheltered
the homeless. The man, a former worker at a restaurant called
Veggie Heaven, left Texas for a California monastery to study
Buddhism, co-workers say.
</P>
<P>
   One constant problem the Krishnas had with Dukes was his long,
dirty hair and beard and filthy clothing; Dukes didn't meet the
strict Krishna code of cleanliness.
</P>
<P>
   While Dukes wouldn't cut his hair, he met his hosts halfway. He
shaved his beard, tied his hair back and took regular showers. He
also wore clothes given to him.
</P>
<P>
   He asked to be given a spiritual name but the Krishnas knew
there was no way he'd complete the rigid, six-month session to
become a member. He instead was called Bhakdas Daniel, ``bhakdas''
being a title used for friends or newcomers to Krishna.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became very normal when he was here. He was dirty but
harmless when he came. In one week he became happy,'' reports
Keshava.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes took part in Krishna chanting on the streets of Coconut
Grove. He sat for hours in the temple's library painstakingly
copying Sanskrit and English translations from the Krishna bible.
He attended Keshava's lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes' longest, uninterrupted stay at the temple was two weeks.
Usually after three or four days, he'd disappear. Krishnas would
see him drinking beer and reading skin magazines around Coconut
Grove. He shoplifted, sometimes from them, Krishnas say, even
though he had food stamps and a Shell credit card, the monthly
bills paid by his mother in Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dukes had a bed at the temple, Krishnas, who rise at
3:30 a.m. daily to begin prayers and meditation, would find Dukes
sleeping in the garden at the front of the former Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Three women at the temple, each middle-aged with grown adult
sons near Dukes' age, describe him as childlike and prone to
outbursts at inappropriate times, such as during meditation.
</P>
<P>
   He could burst out laughing at nothing and then instantly fall
silent for three hours, staring straight ahead, saying nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a child,'' says Geetavali, shaking her head.
``Look,'' she says, opening a notebook of doodles and drawings he
gave her when he left. ``The work of a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Nartaka Gopala sorts mail at the temple, and says she twice gave
Dukes letters from his mother, urging him him to write back. ``But
it was like he couldn't get it together enough to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nartaka would scold Dukes. ``What are you doing here? We don't
want people who are halfway here, halfway out the door. He said,
`OK, like, I'll try.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I treated him like my son,'' adds Sonja Lerner, whose Krishna
spiritual name is Gandharrika dasi. ``He liked having a mother. He
called me mother.''
</P>
<P>
   She tends the garden raising Tulasi plants, a sacred plant from
India used medicinally and spiritually. Dukes' favorite Krishna job
was working in the garden with Lerner, who has a 34-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   She points to an Angel's Trumpet alongside the church. ``He
planted that.'' Lerner says she believes Dukes death was an
accident. ``He was very curious. He might have seen the whale show
and wanted to swim with the whales.''
</P>
<P>
   Keshava disagrees. ``He only spoke with me about philosophy,
about god and the power of supreme love. He was intelligent. For
me, he probably committed suicide. He was searching for
spirituality. He asked many questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pushed him. I told him, `You need one way, one path.' He'd
just listen. But he never could commit. He never could follow the
rules.''

 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Double lives are usually led by spies and
philanderers, not doctors and musicians. But Dr. David Sulzer, an
assistant professor of neurology and psychiatry at Columbia
University's medical school, is leading so many lives _ one
medical, several musical _ that you have to wonder where he finds
the time to be all the people he is.
</P>
<P>
   By day, Sulzer, 42, investigates ``how synapses are modulated
during behavior and learning,'' as he put it, adding a loose
translation: ``It's very basic research about how the brain
works.'' Laboratory work, he said, takes up most of his time, and
he speaks of it with considerable excitement, noting that
neurobiology is a ``fascinating field that's undergoing a
revolution right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Dr. Sulzer takes off his lab coat and leaves New
York-Presbyterian Hospital in upper Manhattan, he becomes Dave
Soldier, a prolific composer and arranger and a busy violinist,
guitarist and banjo player. Soldier is the name on the buzzer of
his TriBeCa apartment, and it is how he is known in the downtown
arts world, where the boundaries of avant-garde classical music,
rhythm and blues, jazz and alternative rock are porous.
</P>
<P>
   His two principal ensembles are the Soldier String Quartet _ a
quartet that was at first augmented by a drummer, and now by blues
and gospel singers _ and the Kropotkins, an acoustic country blues
sextet. Both groups play his own works, as well as his arrangements
of classic blues tunes; the quartet also plays works by rock
composers from Jimi Hendrix to John Cale.
</P>
<P>
   Soldier has also toured and recorded with Cale and has written
arrangements for several of Cale's recent projects, including the
1996 ``Walking on Locusts'' album and a ballet, ``Nico.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What got me paying attention to him,'' Cale said, ``was that
in his blues transcriptions, and his own works too, when he writes
for strings he makes them something to be reckoned with. As a
fiddler, he manhandles his instrument, really brutalizes it, in a
way that's entertaining and refreshing, and in improvisations, he
can handle anything you throw at him.''
</P>
<P>
   As an arranger, he ``has a very careful ear,'' Cale said. ``We
did some work together on my ``Nico'' ballet, and I think he was
uncomfortable with that because there was a lot of elegant
intertwining of parts. He's more into spiky transcriptions in which
he can give every instrument its day in the sun and really get
gymnastic. His arrangements are often like a string player's crunch
session.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer Soldier has been concentrating on several new
recordings. The second Kropotkins album, ``Five Points Crawl,'' is
due in stores next month, and the quartet's latest, ``Inspect for
Damaged Gods,'' in September, both on the independent new Mulatta
label. Also due from Mulatta next month is ``Ice-9 Ballads,'' an
orchestral album with Richard Auldon Clark and the Manhattan
Chamber Orchestra, which has performed virtually all of Soldier's
symphonic scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``What turned me on about Dave's music from the first time I
heard it was that he walks so easily between styles,'' said Clark,
who before meeting Soldier had performed only traditional repertory
and new music by academicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ice-9 Ballads,'' the title work on Soldier's new orchestral
disk, is based on Kurt Vonnegut's ``Cat's Cradle.'' It weaves
together calypso with an early 20th-century salon style and a touch
of modernist angularity. Vonnegut narrates sections of the
recording, and Jimmy Justice, one of the vocalists in the current
incarnation of the Soldier String Quartet, sings the ballads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is undergoing the same kind of growth as neurology,''
Soldier said when asked how he was able to juggle so many diverse
projects. ``We listen to so many kinds of music now, from medieval
music to music from Asia, Africa, South America and all over the
world. And because things don't move in ways they did before, we
can grab from here and from there, and we get these weird things
happening. We can now use any sound, any rhythm, any kind of
polyphony, any kind of phrasing. And the computer has made it
possible to record anything we can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Soldier's orchestral scores and his work with the
quartet and the Kropotkins seem conventional compared with some of
his other projects. He has, for example, undertaken several
collaborations with the Russian-born conceptual artists Vitaly
Komar and Alex Melamid.
</P>
<P>
   Last year they released ``The People's Choice Music,'' a
recording based on a survey asking people what they liked and hated
in music, similar to a project the artists had done with paintings.
Soldier filled both orders: ``The Most Wanted Song'' is a gooey
five-minute ballad; ``The Most Unwanted Song'' is a 22-minute
compendium of everything respondents hated, including bagpipe and
accordion music, opera and children singing chain-store jingles.
</P>
<P>
   Soldier's eclecticism is reflected in his apartment, a jungle of
classical, pop and world culture artifacts. Instruments hanging on
his walls include ancient Greek and Babylonian lyres, Chinese
erhus, fiddles and a set of Star Trek-worthy electric quartet
instruments made for him by Ken Butler. A broken-down upright piano
sits beside a computer on which Soldier edits his recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the piano, Godzilla, Bart Simpson and Pee-wee Herman
preside over a table of kitschy statuary. The scores of ``Boris
Godunov'' and ``Tosca'' share space with ``Great Songs of
Broadway'' and chemistry texts on his packed bookshelves. And LPs
by Stevie Wonder and Bill Monroe sit atop the stacks of discs near
his stereo system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm in a Stevie Wonder phase now,'' he said. ``I play
his music for my musician friends, and they say, `But it's so
simple.' And I say, `oh yeah? Play this part on the piano.' And
they realize real fast that he's very deep harmonically, and that
he's doing some wild stuff that you don't notice because he makes
it sound so smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   His early musical influences _ what was in the air when he was
in junior high school in Carbondale, Ill., around 1970 _ were Isaac
Hayes, James Brown, country and western music and heavy metal. But
he also played the viola, the violin and the piano and listened to
classical music.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point I just thought, `This music is dead,''' he said
of the classics, ``so I stopped taking lessons and started playing
the guitar. It took me a long time to realize that the music wasn't
dead _ it was just played as if it were dead.''
</P>
<P>
   At 16, he moved with his family to Storrs, Conn., and became
fascinated with the complicated brass writing in salsa after
hearing an Eddie Palmieri recording on the radio. He hoped to learn
that kind of scoring when he enrolled in a composition class at
Michigan State University, but he found the course work
unappealingly academic. Instead, he looked up Roscoe Mitchell, the
avant-garde saxophonist, and studied composition with him
privately.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, after a brief sojourn in Florida, where he was a
backing guitarist for Bo Diddley, Soldier _ then Sulzer _ came to
New York and established the pattern of his current life: he
attended the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia, took
courses at the Juilliard School and private composition lessons
with Otto Luening, and spent his nights playing with several bands,
including the Ordinaires. He formed the Soldier String Quartet in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had thought of the string quartet almost as a dead form,''
Soldier said. ``But I liked quartet music, and when I thought about
why I was into the quartets of Haydn and Beethoven, I realized it
was because it was so polyphonic. And I thought, what's the
greatest American addition to polyphony? It's the drum sound.
You've got a single player holding down one beat here and another
beat there. They don't do that in African or Asian drumming; it's
an American thing. So by adding drums, I had both kinds of
polyphony.''
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the drums with singers, he said, ``was a way to get a
more interesting kind of phrasing happening.'' He continued: ``And
I find that when we play for audiences that aren't either bohemians
or intellectuals, the singers speak directly to people. The music
can be quite advanced and challenging, but there's something about
the voice: people get it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   In virtually every regard but its core instrumentation, the
Soldier String Quartet is a rock band. Having a drummer meant that
the string players had to be amplified, and they played standing
and with a vibrancy bordering on ferocity. Soldier has written and
arranged many pieces for the group, but he has also put it at the
service of other composers, most notably Elliott Sharp, whose music
fills six of its CDs.
</P>
<P>
   More recently the quartet has collaborated with the flutist
Robert Dick on a pair of adventurous albums, ``Third Stone From the
Sun,'' a collection of Hendrix arrangements, and ``Jazz Standards
From Mars,'' and it plays on ``Do the Collapse,'' the new album by
the rock band Guided by Voices. Maintaining a steady roster has
been Soldier's biggest difficulty with the quartet. The reasons, he
says, are financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played in Finland a few months ago,'' he said, ``and
everyone in the quartet was paid $1,500, which is great for
classical musicians who are not stars. But that doesn't happen
frequently, and it's not easy to find people who can do this
indefinitely. You need players with a special attitude, or who have
day jobs, like me, and are doing it for the love of the music.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kropotkins specialize in a quirky twist on Delta blues. On
their debut recording, ``The Kropotkins,'' standards like Bukka
White's ``Parchman Farm'' nestle up against Soldier's alluringly
angular ``Nasadiya,'' a setting of a passage from an ancient Hindu
text, the ``Rig Veda.'' The group is geographically far-flung: most
of the players live in New York, but the band's drummer, Maureen
Tucker _ who, like Cale, was an original member of the Velvet
Underground _ lives in Douglas, Ga., and Lorrette Velvette, its
lead singer, lives in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a kind of epiphany,'' Soldier said of his idea for the
Kropotkins, which came to him while touring in Germany with Cale
several years ago. ``The music was great, but we had to carry all
this equipment, and we had to have a sound check every day. But
when I was walking through Stuttgart, there was a Japanese band
playing Bill Monroe bluegrass out in the street. And I thought,
isn't this great _ no setups, no amplification, you just play.''
</P>
<P>
   A large white message board hanging over Soldier's computer
conveys what else he is up to. It lists a gospel choral work
commissioned by Paul Hillier and the Hilliard Ensemble. About half
finished is an arrangement of Schoenberg's String Quartet No. 2
that ``uses all the notes, but makes the rhythms funky, like James
Brown.'' And he is considering a second opera, having learned from
the response to his first, ``Naked Revolution,'' a collaboration
with Komar and Melamid that was performed at the Kitchen to mixed
reviews in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently it is very common for people who come from
countries with authoritarian governments to dream about the
leaders,'' he said, ``so these guys would dream about Stalin and
Washington. And I thought, what could be more interesting as an
opera?
</P>
<P>
   ``But as it turns out, that was too esoteric and it confused
people. So I looked closely at the operas that were successful, new
and old, and I realized that what people really want in an opera is
a woman who dies so that you can feel terrible and cry for her.
Even my own favorite operas do that, and you ignore it at your
peril.''  &QL;

 FEINSTEIN'S NAME FLOATED AS POSSIBLE VEEP CANDIDATE   (EDs: FILED
in ``p'' and ``w'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The name of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California
Democrat, is being floated in party circles as a possible vice
presidential candidate in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings, D-S.C., said Tuesday that her
name has been put forward in informal discussions ``in the
cloakroom'' among Democratic senators. He was referring to a
gathering place just off the Senate floor where lawmakers hold
private conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why Feinstein is being mentioned, Hollings told
reporters, ``She's a dynamic speaker and public servant on the one
hand, but (also) she'd bring California'' behind the Democratic
ticket. The state, with 54 of the 270 electoral votes required to
win the White House, is the largest prize in the presidential
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., who heads the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), which helps recruit and fund
Democratic Senate candidates, said Feinstein's name tops every list
he's seen for the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has gained a lot of experience at different levels of
government,'' Torricelli said. ``She has the depth of knowledge and
the independence that many of us want in a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. J. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., who formerly headed the DSCC,
said Feinstein would be ``very strong'' on a national ticket.
``She's got charisma; she's got the spark that people recognize,''
Kerrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maslin, an Oakland-Calif.-based Democratic pollster, said
Feinstein ``would add an awful lot to any ticket ... There aren't a
whole lot of people at this level of the Democratic Party who have
the kinds of credentials that she has.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the talk of her as a Democratic running mate,
Feinstein stressed that neither Vice President Al Gore, the party's
leading candidate, nor former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, his
challenger, has discussed the office with her.
</P>
<P>
   If she were invited to join the ticket, she said in an
interview, ``it would be a hard decision.'' She added that she does
not foresee any such invitation.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation concerns her, she said, because she doesn't want
her constituents to think she isn't running for the Senate. As it
stands now, she said, ``I am not going after anything else (in
2000) but my Senate seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Before winning a Senate seat in a special election in 1992,
Feinstein was the Democratic nominee for California governor, the
mayor of San Francisco for nearly 11 years and a member of the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein is considered a political moderate. She has supported
traditional liberal issues such as abortion rights and gun control
while backing traditional conservative fare such as the death
penalty and the toughening of immigration standards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave
Feinstein a 90 percent approval rating in 1998, down from 95
percent in 1996. The American Conservative Union, however, gave
Feinstein a 4 percent approval rating in 1998, down from a career
high of 20 percent in 1996.

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Aug. 1,
1999. &QL;

   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE story &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VENICE-BIENNALE (Venice, Italy) _ To look at new art is to
expect to feel something or be told something or be tweaked or
entertained in ways that have nothing necessarily to do with
tangible objects. Art less and less is judged by the old priorities
of painting, sculpture and drawing. It is context that increasingly
determines the shape of the art we see. Exhibit No. 1: the 48th
Venice Biennale. It's commonly being said about the show that video
art dominates, which is true, but only up to a point. By Michael
Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHEREAU-FILMS (Undated) _ Part enfant terrible and part national
treasure, Patrice Chereau has built a formidable reputation in
France, with three decades of groundbreaking work in theater, opera
and, increasingly, film. His latest movie, ``Those Who Love Me Can
Take the Train,'' had its premiere at the Cannes International Film
Festival last year. By Leslie Camhi. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   ILLUMINATA-FILM (Undated) _ It's twilight _ the haunting hour
that mingles longing and regret, promise and speculation _ and the
world's youngest method actor is brooding in his Brooklyn bedroom.
``Usually, I (italics)like(end italics) challenging roles,'' says
Amedeo Turturro with the magnificent assurance of an 8-year-old.
``But that role was so challenging, they practically had to force
me to do it.'' The ``they'' he's referring to are his parents, the
actors John Turturro and Katherine Borowitz. The ``it'' is
``Illuminata,'' an engagingly heartfelt new film in which all three
appear. ``Illuminata,'' which opens on Friday, is about a stock
company of 19th-century actors, and the Turturro family has pretty
much become a stock company, too. Husband and wife have performed
together in three plays and three movies, two of which Amedeo
cameoed in. By Franz Lidz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   STARR-TAPE-THEATER (Undated) _ ``Starr's Last Tape,'' a one-man
play in which a character named Starr, dressed in a prison jump
suit and surrounded by tapes abnd tape recorders, sings hymns,
tunes in to phone taps and dictates his memoirs. The play will have
its world premiere in Stockbridge, Mass., at the Berkshire Theater
Festival's second stage, the Unicorn, from Aug. 24 through 28.
Brian Reddy, who played Stephen Douglas in the 1993 Lincoln Center
Theater revival of ``Abe Lincoln in Illinois,'' will star as
Kenneth N. Starr, directed by Eric Hill. By Sylviane Gold. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CARNIVAL-CENTURY-FEST (New York) _ To many New Yorkers, Lincoln
Center Out-of-Doors has always been there _ a three-week
extravaganza every August that offers a diverse fare of free dance,
music and theater. The forthcoming series, the ``Carnival of the
Century,'' starting Friday, is solidly within that tradition. It
includes the jazz pianist Dave Brubeck, a Greek blues singer, Les
Ballets Trokadero de Monte Carlo, music of the Jewish Diaspora, a
Peruvian dance company and the Colorado String Quartet, plus
entertainment designed just for children. By Valerie Gladstone.

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PEONY-PAVILION-MUSIC (New York) _ It's no use either admiring or
picking apart the Lincoln Center Festival '99. Management had
co-designers imposed on it, Shanghai bureaucracy and Lady Luck
among them. The last-minute cancellation of ``The Peony Pavilion''
in 1998 left a hole in the center of the event a year ago. The
resuscitation of this 19-hour Ming Dynasty classic in 1999 was
welcomed by nearly everyone, but it certainly altered any theme
Lincoln Center might originally have had in mind. By Bernard
Holland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PROPAGANDA-PHOTOGS (Washington) _ The word propaganda originally
meant spreading the religious faith; it acquired a generally
pejorative sense only in World War I, when governments took strict
control of war information that could be used in the mass media.
Long before, every medium that could spread ideologies or enhance
renown and power had been called upon to do so. Popes and kings and
dictators commissioned architecture, sculpture and painting,
enlisted playwrights and speakers, and hired designers to shape the
ruler's image and fashion the servants' livery as well as the
military's uniforms. When photography came along, it, too, was soon
pressed into service. By Vicki Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   MODERN-BOOKS-COLLECTING (Undated) _ Since the early '90s, prices
for first editions of modern literary works have hit the
stratosphere: $35,000 for a signed copy of Jack Kerouac's ``On the
Road''; $250,000 for a copy of ``Ulysses'' signed by James Joyce to
Ezra Pound, and $15,000 for Harper Lee's ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
The gold rush in such literary ``high points'' _ the industry term
for well known titles by name authors _ has also fostered
speculation in recently published books _ first editions printed
within the last five years that are still in pristine condition and
preferably signed by the author. By Christa Worthington.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-ONCE-AGAIN (Undated) _ A look at ABC's forthcoming drama
series ``Once and Again,'' which will be introduced for seven
weeks, starting Tuesday, Sept. 21, at 10 p.m. By Bernard Weinraub.

   Very humid air streaming northeast from the Mississippi Valley
will fuel a large cluster of heavy showers and thunderstorms over
the central Great Lakes Wednesday morning. The cool, moist
downdrafts within some of the thunderstorms will produce outflow
boundaries, or mini-cold fronts. As these fronts progress southward
and lift sultry air, the stage will be set for additional storms to
erupt over the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians during the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Puffy cumulus clouds will dot an otherwise clear sky across the
interior Northeast Wednesday. Meanwhile, breezes from the west
descending and drying on route to the Northeast seaboard will cause
clouds to crumble, bringing abundant sunshine and very warm
conditions from New York City to Washington. Exceptionally hot
weather will cover an expansive region from the northern Plains to
the Southeast. Indeed, beneath mainly sunny skies, daytime readings
will soar to near 100 degrees in many places.
</P>
<P>
   Moist air in the lowest few thousand feet of the atmosphere will
promote patchy clouds and spotty storms over the central and
southern Rockies. As is typical, the clouds and showers will be
most numerous during the afternoon when the uneven heating of the
varied terrain promotes vigorous rising currents of moistened air.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific states will be mainly dry and sunny. A brief
thunderstorm, however, may occur in the late afternoon near the
eastern slopes of the Cascades. Elsewhere, morning clouds grazing
the Pacific Coast will yield to ample afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Hot Minneapolis
</P>
<P>
   It soared to 99 degrees in Minneapolis on Sunday, marking the
twelfth time this summer and the eighth time this month that the
mercury has reached 90 degrees or more. The reading was also the
city's highest temperature since the mercury hit 101 degrees on
July 13, 1995. Though hot weather has been a salient, recurrent
feature of the upper Midwest in June and July, this summer cannot
compare to the blistering, tenacious heat of the summer of 1988.
That summer, the mercury climbed to 90 degrees or more on 45 days
in Minneapolis, with 17 of those occurring in July alone.

CRITICS ASSAIL RATINGS BOARD OVER `EYES WIDE SHUT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The New York Film Critics Circle has joined Los
Angeles critics in attacking the Motion Picture Association of
America for requiring that Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut'' be
altered to qualify for its R rating.
</P>
<P>
   A statement by the New York group, signed by 28 members and
issued Monday night, said the association's ratings board was ``out
of control'' and had ``become a punitive and restrictive force,
effectively trampling the freedom of American filmmakers.'' The
association said the board ``had created its own zone of knee-jerk
Puritanism.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue was the insistence by the board that a scene of a
sexual orgy warranted an NC-17 rating, which would have meant that
no one under 17 would be admitted. For the film to receive an R
rating _ requiring that anyone under 17 be accompanied by an adult
_ 65 seconds of the movie were digitally altered. Essentially,
shrouded digital figures were placed in front of couples engaged in
sex, partly blocking the audience's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' which was Kubrick's final film, was released
with the R rating on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, chairman of the Motion Picture Association, has
strongly defended the board, saying that its purpose is to provide
guidelines for parents, not critics. In a column in Variety last
week, he described those who had assailed the board as ``this small
band of constant whiners'' who ``talk to each other, write for each
other, opine with each other and view with lacerating contempt the
rubes who live Out There, west of Manhattan and east of the San
Andreas Fault.''
</P>
<P>
   But the New York critics asked, ``How is it possible that a
serious movie about human sexuality, made by one of the world's
master filmmakers, cannot be seen by American adults in its
intended form, when those same adults can watch comparable fare any
night on cable television?'' The statement follows a similar one by
35 members of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.
</P>
<P>
   The New York film critics asked Warner Brothers, which released
the movie, to provide details on what had been approved by Kubrick,
who died in March, in terms of altering the film. ``The process by
which this bowdlerized edition of Kubrick's final film came into
being has been shrouded in vagueness and misinformation,'' the New
York critics said.
</P>
<P>
   The film itself, starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a
married couple in New York on a sexual odyssey, received wildly
mixed reviews. After strong box office sales in its first weekend,
attendance has dropped sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to criticism, Terry Semel, co-chairman of Warner
Brothers, said last week: ``We're not in the NC-17 business. When
one looks at `Eyes Wide Shut' perhaps there was not a huge
difference between what would be an R, what would be an NC-17. But
NC-17 is a whole industry. It includes triple-X-rated porno films.
So to us that's just not a business that we're in. Never have
been.''

 &HT;    IN CONGRESS, A DAY FOR POTTY POLITICS
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House subcommittee considered a swirling
controversy Tuesday that Congress just can't sit on: unpopular
1.6-gallon flush toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1992 law aimed at conserving water, 1.6 gallons per
flush is the maximum allowed for new toilets manufactured for sale
in the United States. That's less than half the old standard of 3.5
gallons, and many constituents are complaining that it's not enough
to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``My office has received thousands of phone calls, letters and
e-mails from disgruntled consumers who are angry that their new
toilets repeatedly clog, require multiple flushing, and do not save
water,'' said Rep. Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Knollenberg is the author of the Plumbing Standards Improvement
Act, which would repeal both the federal flush standard and a
similar requirement that shower heads use no more than 2.5 gallons
of water per minute.
</P>
<P>
   At a Commerce subcommittee hearing, Knollenberg showed a video
clip from the ``Seinfeld'' TV sitcom in which the characters can't
rinse shampoo from their hair with newly installed shower heads.
``Low flow. I don't like the sound of that,'' Kramer frets.
</P>
<P>
   While the subject might be an easy target for bathroom humor,
the issue is serious, insisted the panel's chairman, Rep. Joe
Barton, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But then Rep. Richard Burr, R-N.C., read his opening statement,
which was written on a roll of toilet paper. Burr said he supports
the legislation introduced by Knollenberg, whom he jokingly called
``my dear friend, Congressman Flush.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 Energy Policy Act, which passed the House by a 328-79
margin and was signed by President Bush, has resulted in
significant savings of water, said Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla.,
who opposes its repeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Plumbing Manufacturers Institute, which represents the
makers of toilets, also opposes the legislation. The 1992 law has
worked well, testified David Goike, a spokesman for Masco Corp., a
Detroit manufacturer of plumbing fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has been in your bathroom since the 1400s,'' he
said, ``ever since officials determined that emptying chamber pots
out the window into the street caused disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the law said 16 billion gallons of water will be
saved in 1999 from the low-flow bathroom fixtures installed in new
homes built in 1998. If every household used the devices, Americans
could save 5.4 billion gallons _ and $11.3 million on their water
bills _ every day, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., questioned the figures. Toilets
with a 1.6-gallon capacity often have to be flushed twice, he said,
so they don't save much water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core problem,'' home builder Jerry Kosmensky told the
subcommittee, ``is that many low-flow, 1.6-gallon toilets do not
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosmensky, president of Gerald Building Co. in Southgate, Mich.,
said the new federal requirements have jeopardized his professional
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I tell a new homeowner that the reason their toilet
doesn't work has nothing to do with the plumbing installation but
is because of a federal mandate on low-flow toilets, they think I'm
joking, that I'm making excuses,'' said Kosmensky.
</P>
<P>
   Knollenberg said the situation is so bad that some Americans are
going to Canada to buy 3.5-gallon toilets, many of which were
manufactured in the United States for export. It is not illegal for
individual homeowners to import the toilets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knollenberg said he is optimistic that his bill would pass if
brought to the House floor. The outcry from constituents is only
going to intensify as more old toilets are replaced by new low-flow
ones, he predicted.

A LITTLE `ALLY' FROM BIG `ALLY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The most closely watched new television show
of the fall season may be one that really isn't new at all.
</P>
<P>
   But if David E. Kelley creates a workable show out of the
half-hour re-edited version of ``Ally McBeal'' that Fox will
introduce on Tuesday nights in September, he may be on the way to
creating a whole new form of television: the incredible shrinking
hourlong television show.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said in an interview here that the condensed version of
his hit series, which is appropriately being titled simply ``Ally''
because it's only half of the original show (he called it, rather
affectionately, ``the mini-Ally''), grew mainly out of his reaction
when he tried to sell repeats of the hourlong version in
syndication.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't that much heat on it,'' he said, ``because of a
mindset that said it was too hot for its own good, that it was
therefore trendy and wouldn't be timeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, who is an intensely competitive man beneath his laconic
genius-at-work persona, was, he acknowledged, ``kind of annoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``I just felt, you know, I can sit down and make an
`Ally' half-hour, and it may not be the best half-hour known to
man, but it'll be better than some that are syndicating for prices
that are far better than what was being offered on `Ally.'''
</P>
<P>
   Having thought from the beginning that the show might work well
as a half hour, Kelley set to editing down some early ``Ally''
episodes. When he had five down he presented the idea to Fox
programmers. They liked it because it was very inexpensive, since
the half-hour ``Ally'' episodes would be reduced versions of
repeats of the first two years of the show.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he was hatching the idea to cut down ``Ally,''
Kelley went to CBS, which was about to cancel his longest-running
creation, ``Chicago Hope,'' and talked it into a new season based
on his commitment to write a closing episode for last season and an
opener for this season. Kelley said he was convinced that the show
still had areas to explore, especially in the field of experimental
medicine. He said he always felt he had given up too easily when
CBS canceled an earlier series of his, ``Picket Fences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to relive that regret,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of this adds up to five shows on the air for David E. Kelley
Productions this coming season. On a new one for ABC, ``Snoops,''
Kelley said he would do little more than consult. He will continue
to write most of ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice,'' and he said
he would stay with both of those shows for the lives of their runs.
</P>
<P>
   But he seems most intrigued by the reconfigured half-hour
``Ally,'' which will be broadcast one night after new episodes of
the hourlong ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The half-hour version will have a new music theme and even some
new scenes, mostly culled from material cut from episodes that have
been shown. Kelley said he was mostly dropping the courtroom scenes
and retaining all the ``office relationships and sexual tension.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the experience is whetting Kelley's appetite
for the half-hour format, and he has a notion to try a novel
approach to creating a half-hour series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might try to say to a network: Let me introduce this show as
an hour and let me run 13 episodes, first in its hour format. Let
the audience get used to these characters, and once they are
accustomed to them then let me cut it to a half-hour.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC's New Troika
</P>
<P>
   ABC introduced its new three-headed programming committee at a
news conference here, and took pains to assure the rest of the
television industry that the new creation was not some form of
Disney animated monster.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and its parent, Walt Disney Co., had announced earlier in
July that they were combining the operations of their television
studio, Touchstone, and the ABC Entertainment division, creating a
vertically integrated programming structure, the first of its kind
for television.
</P>
<P>
   Stu Bloomberg and Lloyd Braun were named co-chairman of the new
entity, with Jamie Tarses the president.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the three executives tried to explain how the
structure would work, though Braun acknowledged that nobody would
really know if this was a workable arrangement for at least a year.
``All this talk is cheap,'' Braun said.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that many agents and writers, who will be essential
for ABC to keep generating successful shows, are confused by the
new structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there is confusion,'' Braun said. ``It's incumbent
that in the days and weeks ahead we give the town a sense of
clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   What is alarming some other executives is that the Disney
studio, formerly an independent entity that supplied programs to
every network, is now formally folded into ABC. The three ABC
executives promised they would continue to solicit shows from every
supplier and would themselves deliver shows to other networks.
</P>
<P>
   But executives like Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS
Television, are questioning whether ABC will hurt itself by sending
out a message that it and its studio are strictly dedicated to
ABC's own interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any network expects to get a show from that company,
they're out of their minds,'' Moonves said. ``I think any outside
supplier that goes to ABC is also out of their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg said such comments might be expected from competitors
like Moonves. But Braun acknowledged that the new entity needed to
convince suppliers of shows that it would not limit their ideas to
finding a place on ABC. To that end, he said, ABC will announce
shortly a deal with a program creator that will bring one show in
the deal to ABC and another to a competing network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's imperative that Stu and I run this entity in a non-myopic
way,'' Braun said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Tarses, she will be in the unusual role of being
involved in developing shows through the studio up to the point
when they are offered to a different network. Then, Bloomberg said,
``a Chinese wall will fall,'' and she will be separated. This
presumably will reassure the competing network that ABC's interests
will not interfere with the other network's interests.

 &HT;    `Hope' rises from the ashes
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It was the worst blood-letting seen on TV in
years: Dr. Jeffrey Geiger (Mandy Patinkin) returned to Chicago Hope
Hospital for the series' season-ending episode, walked into a room
with a bunch of doctors _ and fired just about all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys haven't been talking about medicine,'' he told the
stunned group. ``You've been talking about everything except
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The housecleaning was quick and final, less a dramatic turn in a
storyline (it earned Patinkin a guest-appearance Emmy nomination)
than a dramatic metaphor for the clean sweep the creator of CBS's
nearly-dead ``Chicago Hope'' knew was necessary if the series could
be revived.
</P>
<P>
   ```Chicago Hope' was in trouble in terms of even getting
renewed,'' says creator David E. Kelley. ``We met with CBS and
agreed that in order for `Chicago Hope' to come back, it would have
to be reborn again, and sweeping changes would have to be
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Out: six regulars, including Christine Lahti, Peter Berg, Jayne
Brook and Eric Stoltz.
</P>
<P>
   In: a boatload of newcomers, including Lauren Holly, Barbara
Hershey and Patinkin, once the show's exasperating soul, who left
four years ago to spend more time with his family, but who returns
in a role whose frequency is still being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving: Adam Arkin, Hector Elizondo, Mark Harmon and Rocky
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving wasn't the easiest position to be in. Those whose
characters were axed found out just shortly before the episode was
filmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a hard way to end the
season,'' says Arkin. ``It was traumatic. (It was) hard to see
people we had worked with for such a long time have to be surprised
with their own departures. It was a hard couple weeks for everyone
connected with the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most dramatic thing was building the underground tunnel
system out of (the studio) and escorting the other cast members out
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bit of a surprise and a trauma, but we've proven to
be quite resilient,'' adds Elizondo. ``We've lost many people in
the past, so we know how to take a punch.''
</P>
<P>
   The show needs a big punch. It finished the past season 73rd in
the ratings, and lost any direction that pointed toward a future.
It had become more soap opera than hospital drama, a situation
Kelley and new executive producers Henry Bromell (``Homicide: Life
on the Street,'' ``Northern Exposure'') and Michael Pressman
(``Picket Fences'') plan to correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character I want to reintroduce to the show is the
hospital,'' says Pressman. ``When you call it `Chicago Hope,' it's
about this state-of-the-art hospital, and we want to return to
those themes.''
</P>
<P>
   Also taking a more active role in the show is Kelley, who since
creating ``Hope'' five years ago has spent most of his time with
two of his other series, ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice.'' (He
has a new series this year on ABC, ``Snoops.'') While Kelley will
still spend most of his time with ``Ally'' and ``The Practice,'' he
has written the ``Hope'' season opener and will consult more
actively on other scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley knows reviving the series for the longterm is a longshot:
it'll air Thursdays at 9 p.m., opposite NBC's ``Frasier.'' But he
thought he was better off rehabbing what he had than creating an
entirely new medical drama. He also didn't want to pull the plug on
something he believes still has some life left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a future is still there. I may be wrong, but I
would have kicked myself a year or two from now if we just let
go,'' Kelley says. ``The truth is, I do that with `Picket Fences'
from time to time. I still regret letting it go, because I think
there was more life in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I didn't want to live that regret twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Title clash
</P>
<P>
   ABC and CBS premiere dramas this season with near-exact titles:
``Once and Again'' (ABC) and ``Now and Again'' (CBS). Both networks
agree somebody's title has to go, but both say it won't be their's.
Earlier this week, CBS TV president Leslie Moonves said he'd wait
for ABC to blink first. On Tuesday, ABC said they weren't blinking,
that ``Once and Again'' creators Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskowitz
(``thirtysomething,'' ``My So-Called Life'') are committed to the
title and that the series is strong enough to draw people no matter
what it's called. ``People watch shows, not titles,'' said ABC
entertainment head Jamie Tarses. What's that again?
</P>
<P>
   Carey does improv
</P>
<P>
   ``The Drew Carey Show'' will air a live episode in November. The
show will contain a partially unscripted storyline, in which the
cast plays improvisational games. It'll be performed three times _
once for each time zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's live, there's gonna be improv, anything can happen,''
said executive producer Bruce Helford. ``I just hope they don't tap
the keg until after the third show.''
</P>
<P>
   Norm's new show
</P>
<P>
   ABC is developing a political quiz show for Norm Macdonald, who
currently stars in the network's sitcom ``The Norm Show.'' As with
Drew Carey's popular ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?'', the format is
taken from a hit British show. ``The success of `Whose Line' is
testament to what happens if you come up with an original idea,''
said ABC entertainment head Jamie Tarses. Hmmm. The show could air
mid-season.
</P>
<P>
   `Parts' blurred
</P>
<P>
   USA is taking a different approach to airing Howard Stern's
1997, R-rated ``Private Parts'' on Aug. 27: rather than edit out
unacceptable-for-basic-cable language and nudity, the network will
simply bleep and blur it.

   WASHINGTON _ Despite a rigorous debate over human rights in
China and evidence that China stole U.S. nuclear secrets, the House
voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to back President Clinton's decision
to renew normal trade relations with the world's most populous
nation.
</P>
<P>
   This year's debate was more contentious than in previous years
because of the nuclear spying allegations and reports of recent
human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote of 260 to 170 in favor of retaining normal trade
was about the same as last year's 264-166 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we are doing this to ourselves,'' said Rep.
Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., of the annual China debate. ``Every single
year we come up here and beat the tambourine and hit the drum.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1974 law requires that the president make a decision every
year on whether to renew China's trading status _ a status
permanently enjoyed by most of the world's countries expect
Afghanistan, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, Vietnam and Yugoslavia.
Congress then has 60 days to reject the president's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has never repudiated the White House on this issue. The
closest battled came in 1992 when Congress rejected President
George Bush's decision to renew normal trade relations after the
1989 Tiananmen Square massacre when the Chinese government cracked
down on pro-democracy protesters. Bush vetoed that legislation and
the Senate failed to muster the 67 votes required to override.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of renewing China's trade status _ which included
liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans _ cited human rights
abuses like the arrest of people involved in a spiritual meditation
group referred to as Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we hold this debate the Chinese government is conducting
another major crack down,'' said Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J.,
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong-based Center for Human Rights reported Monday that
China arrested 1,200 people last week for their involvement in the
Falun Gong after China's communist government outlawed the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In just about every area I can think of China's record
stinks,'' said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., citing human rights abuses
as well as allegations that China stole U.S. nuclear secrets and is
giving that information to other countries. ``How all this merits
preferential trade status is beyond me.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents like Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., argued that normal
trade status helps China far more than it helps the United States,
producing a U.S. trade deficit with China of $57 billion last year
when the United States imported $71 billion worth of goods from
China while only exporting $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we revoked China's trading status, they are not going to
walk away,'' Pelosi said. ``Where are they going to sell $70
billion worth of goods?''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who also opposed
the renewal of normal trade, noted that the United States sells
more to Belgium, a country of 10 million people, than it does to
China's 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want one-way free trade,'' Gephardt said referring to
China's laws that keep many U.S. goods out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of continuing normal trade relations with China
argued that it's the only way for the United States to coax the
Chinese government to improve its record on human rights and to
further open its markets to U.S. products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agrees that the Chinese government violates human
rights, imprisons dissidents, muzzles free speech and forces women
to have abortions,'' said Rep. Joseph Pitts, R-Pa., ``Revoking
trade status would strengthen the Chinese regime and intensify
these human rights abuses,'' he said, citing letters from American
religious workers living in China.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said the Chinese government wouldn't be hurt at all if
China's trade status were revoked. Instead, he argued, the American
economy would suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan and Europe would be more than happy to replace America
as a reliable supplier,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote came as China and the United States are beginning
to renew trade talks that include discussing ways to allow more
U.S. goods into China, thereby reducing the trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce David Aaron arrived in Beijing
Tuesday for the first-high level trade talks since the United
States accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, on May 7.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are aimed at resuming negotiations about China's entry
into the World Trade Organization, a Geneva-based organization that
regulates world trade. WTO entry would require China to
significantly lower its trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress would have to decide whether to allow China into the
WTO, which includes giving China permanent normal trading status.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the House vote on normal trade relations
``is the right way to advance America's interests'' and said it
``promotes China's integration into the world economy.''

THE TWO WHO INTERVIEWED SERIAL KILLERS FOR TV

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took four years of relentless telephoning of prison
officials, social workers, psychiatrists and others before Maxine
Paul and her Connecticut neighbor and partner, Amy Kalafa, managed
to carve their way through the institutional barricades that stood
between them and their goal.
</P>
<P>
   The two women had set out to make documentaries together. They
wanted to examine psychological therapy, exploring its many forms
and guises. Instead, they wound up interviewing serial killers,
including David Berkowitz, in many forms and guises. The result:
three hourlong programs for Court TV that are, by almost any
standard, unconventional.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paul and Ms. Kalafa (pronounced KAL-if-uh) were the first
documentarians ever permitted inside the Danbury Federal
Corrections Institute, in Danbury, Conn. They have filmed therapy
sessions and interviewed sociopaths in five New York prisons,
including Sing Sing, in Ossining, and the maximum-security Sullivan
Correctional Facility, where Berkowitz is confined.
</P>
<P>
   The program that includes the interview with him is being
broadcast Wednesday night at 10 on Court TV, which bought their
project, called ``Inside the Criminal Mind,'' and is showing it as
part of the cable network's regular primetime series ``Crime
Stories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had heard, on one of our scouting trips, that David
Berkowitz was a model prisoner,'' Ms. Paul said. ``I found that
fascinating, partly because I moved to New York in the summer of
1977, the year of the Son of Sam murders, and partly because what
we're trying to do is look at what makes these people tick. I
thought, `He's a model prisoner? He's a counselor to
lower-functioning inmates?'''
</P>
<P>
   She wrote to Berkowitz, in care of the deputy superintendent at
Sullivan, in Fallsburg, N.Y., but Berkowitz did not reply. For
once, the tenacious Ms. Paul decided to leave well enough alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy and I talked it over, and we figured, we don't want to be
pushy with David Berkowitz,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But last February, the women were at Sullivan interviewing,
among others, a cannibalistic serial killer named Artie Shawcross.
Berkowitz heard about what they were doing, discussed it with
prison counselors and then, via the deputy superintendent, told Ms.
Paul he wanted to be included in their project.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, done in March, several months before Spike
Lee's film, ``Summer of Sam,'' was released, Berkowitz would not
discuss specific details of his crimes. He did talk about his
childhood, his parents, his early belief in Satan and how he became
involved with therapy in prison. Sullivan has a widely praised
psychotherapy program in which Berkowitz works as an inmate program
aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are essentially almost therapy assistants,'' Ed Rudder,
the program's clinical coordinator, says in the documentary. He
says that Berkowitz is ``highly recommended by the inmates he works
with'' and by the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Court TV may be exploiting the interest in Berkowitz by delaying
running the documentary until now, after the storm of publicity
about Lee's film, but to Ms. Paul and Ms. Kalafa, his was just one
more criminal mind to be explored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't consider it exploitive, mostly on the strength of
these filmmakers' work,'' said Sheilagh D'Arcy McGee, Court TV's
senior vice president for programming. ``You look at the three
hours they've delivered and it's an enormous sampling _ of
different prisons, of different men and women, of the programs
they're in before and after their release from jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``But clearly Berkowitz and Shawcross are in a category of their
own,'' she added, acknowledging the likely public fascination with
such killers.
</P>
<P>
   To the two documentarians, Berkowitz and Shawcross are two
people in a diverse gallery of women and men to be examined, as
they try to give viewers a sense of what such criminals are
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   They also want to provide a window into the ways therapy can be
effective, both in the criminal justice system and elsewhere.
Originally, they had hoped to start a cable network, to be called
Therapy TV. They settled for using that name for the production
company they founded, whose studios are in a cottage just behind
Ms. Kalafa's Connecticut home.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paul has an elfin face topped by a crop of dark curly hair,
and the upbeat, high-energy demeanor of a cheerleader. Ms. Kalafa,
slim of face and figure, looks as if she might to be a yoga
instructor or a health food purveyor. Both married and both
mothers, they fit comfortably into the woodsy suburbs of Weston,
Conn., archetypal Martha Stewart country; in fact, Ms. Kalafa's
husband, Alex Gunuey, works nearby as a staff editor on Martha
Stewart's television programs.
</P>
<P>
   But their work jars all those stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Its form is distinctive, first of all. They do not use a
narrator (theirs are the only segments on ``Crime Stories'' that do
not), and their programs look more like cinema verite than like the
smoothly edited documentaries of PBS.
</P>
<P>
   To be as unobtrusive as possible, in hopes of being allowed to
return, they developed what they call ``fly on the wall''
techniques, using mini-digital cameras, which are more
sophisticated than camcorders but almost as small; no added
lighting unless absolutely necessary, and one soundman.
</P>
<P>
   Neither woman is a trained journalist. Ms. Paul was an
entertainment lawyer and Ms. Kalafa was editing a parenting program
for the Lifetime cable network when the two became partners in
Therapy TV five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Questions sometimes go unanswered, and inmates' vague comments
are left unclarified. ``The idea is to stimulate discussion, to
have people to come out of this the way you do from a movie,
saying, `What do you think he meant by that?''' Ms. Kalafa said.
</P>
<P>
   Gunuey, who works as their cameraman and director, added, ``We
are not doing investigative reporting; we're showing a slice of
life, a portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   But many viewers might object that showing counseling sessions
and such therapeutic methods as letting murderers raise puppies is
too sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to find a balance,'' Ms. Kalafa said. ``You can
make someone seem sympathetic, because of his psychosis, or you can
make him seem a monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``And these inmates can be very manipulative. We try not to say,
`This is fact.' We try to give a feeling of a person's mindset, and
suggest the evolution of that mind in prison.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They first approached HBO Downtown Productions with the idea for
eight different series on aspects of psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were interested in the prison series idea, but they
didn't believe we could get into prisons, let alone film their
therapy sessions,'' Ms. Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   So they tried Court TV. When they got a call to come into
Manhattan for an interview last September, Ms. Kalafa was fighting
a serious case of Lyme disease and had an intravenous drip in her
arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy had to drip every four hours,'' Ms. Paul said. ``But this
was the only time Court TV could see us. We took the train to Grand
Central and marched down Third Avenue, pushing that IV pole. We
just couldn't miss that opportunity.''

 FEINSTEIN'S NAME FLOATED AS POSSIBLE VEEP CANDIDATE   (EDs: FILED
in ``p'' and ``w'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The name of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California
Democrat, is being floated in party circles as a possible vice
presidential candidate in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings, D-S.C., said Tuesday that her
name has been put forward in informal discussions ``in the
cloakroom'' among Democratic senators. He was referring to a
gathering place just off the Senate floor where lawmakers hold
private conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why Feinstein is being mentioned, Hollings told
reporters, ``She's a dynamic speaker and public servant on the one
hand, but (also) she'd bring California'' behind the Democratic
ticket. The state, with 54 of the 270 electoral votes required to
win the White House, is the largest prize in the presidential
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., who heads the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), which helps recruit and fund
Democratic Senate candidates, said Feinstein's name tops every list
he's seen for the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has gained a lot of experience at different levels of
government,'' Torricelli said. ``She has the depth of knowledge and
the independence that many of us want in a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. J. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., who formerly headed the DSCC,
said Feinstein would be ``very strong'' on a national ticket.
``She's got charisma; she's got the spark that people recognize,''
Kerrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maslin, an Oakland-Calif.-based Democratic pollster, said
Feinstein ``would add an awful lot to any ticket ... There aren't a
whole lot of people at this level of the Democratic Party who have
the kinds of credentials that she has.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the talk of her as a Democratic running mate,
Feinstein stressed that neither Vice President Al Gore, the party's
leading candidate, nor former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, his
challenger, has discussed the office with her.
</P>
<P>
   If she were invited to join the ticket, she said in an
interview, ``it would be a hard decision.'' She added that she does
not foresee any such invitation.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation concerns her, she said, because she doesn't want
her constituents to think she isn't running for the Senate. As it
stands now, she said, ``I am not going after anything else (in
2000) but my Senate seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Before winning a Senate seat in a special election in 1992,
Feinstein was the Democratic nominee for California governor, the
mayor of San Francisco for nearly 11 years and a member of the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein is considered a political moderate. She has supported
traditional liberal issues such as abortion rights and gun control
while backing traditional conservative fare such as the death
penalty and the toughening of immigration standards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave
Feinstein a 90 percent approval rating in 1998, down from 95
percent in 1996. The American Conservative Union, however, gave
Feinstein a 4 percent approval rating in 1998, down from a career
high of 20 percent in 1996.

   LAGOS, Nigeria _ With Nigeria's move to civilian rule, one of
the songs being played on the radio is ``What Will Tomorrow
Bring?'' by Femi Anikulapo-Kuti, son of the Afro-beat pioneer Fela.
</P>
<P>
   Fela also fearlessly spoke out against corruption and repression
in successive governments, never fleeing into exile despite
beatings and arrests. Since Fela's death from AIDS in 1997, Kuti,
who bears an uncanny resemblance to his father, has assumed his
political and musical mantles.
</P>
<P>
   The military government that stepped down last spring banned his
hit song ``Beng Beng Beng.'' The title makes a sexually explicit
reference and is not a call to arms, he said. But like his father,
Kuti, 36, has a way of making sex seem like an act of political
defiance. ``It's something people want that the government cannot
give us,'' he conceded. ``It makes them irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no love lost between the musician and the new civilian
government of President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was Nigeria's
military ruler in the late 1970s. The ban on ``Beng Beng Beng'' has
not been lifted. Kuti refused to perform at Obasanjo's inauguration
in May, saying: ``I cannot forget the last time he was in power.
``His regime was probably the worst regime Nigeria could ever dream
of. He burnt houses; he burnt markets. His soldiers were flogging
civilians in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kuti added, ``People can change, and we should give him a
second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was more of a diplomat than Fela was. ``My father
would always say, `The government is a thief.' I say, `I would
prefer if the government stops stealing the money.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are other differences. The son doesn't smoke marijuana;
his father always seemed to have a joint at hand. The father's sax
sounded raw; his son's is richer and more virtuosic, and he insists
that his band members dress well and behave politely.
</P>
<P>
   Kuti's songs have the speedy rhythms and Afro-beat sound his
father invented in the 1970s _ a blend of Yoruba high life with
rock and soul _ but they also reflect pop, jazz and African musical
styles. ``Afro-beat is just my starting point,'' Kuti said.
</P>
<P>
   His songs are more structured and more conscious of market
trends. In his latest album, ``Shoki Shoki'' (Polygram), the
quasi-'70s synthesizer and wah-wah-pedal effects owe more to the
funk revival with singers like Lauryn Hill than to music his father
played in his heyday. Kuti's album was No. 1 on the European world
music chart for two months earlier this year and is scheduled to be
released in the United States later this year.
</P>
<P>
   What the father and son's songs share is a libidinous energy,
while focusing on Nigeria's political failures. In Kuti's concerts
his dancers make sexually suggestive movements to lyrics like
``These politicians and soldiers spoil Nigeria so'' and
``government can scatter your head.'' Sometimes Kuti invites
audience members onstage to simulate sex.
</P>
<P>
   Kuti and his band, Positive Force, have been touring Africa and
Europe and are to perform in the United States in September. His
following in the West is linked partly to the popularity of cover
songs from his father's classics like ``Upside Down,'' at
mainstream dance clubs in New York like Body and Soul. Fela has
become a 1970s icon, celebrated as a Nigerian bad boy.
</P>
<P>
   Born Fela Ransome-Kuti, the musician changed his name to Fela
Anikulapo-Kuti, ``anikulapo'' meaning ``he who keeps death in his
pocket'' in Yoruba. Despite his raw and defiant image, he grew up
in a prosperous middle-class family and studied music at the
Trinity College of Music in London. Later, after being exposed to
the ideas of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver, he came to consider
Western education imperialist propaganda and tried to prevent his
children from attending school.
</P>
<P>
   Femi Kuti got his education mostly from playing in his father's
band. ``I begged him to at least let me study music,'' the musician
recalled. ``But he would say, `Everything you need to know you can
learn on the streets.'''
</P>
<P>
   After 16 years in the band, Kuti formed his own group in 1986.
He said that his concerts did not attract much of an audience then
because people ``couldn't understand why I didn't want to keep
playing under a great man like my father.''
</P>
<P>
   His father was not supportive, he said, and derided his music
after watching him perform. ``I felt like committing suicide,''
Kuti recalled, ``but I kept trying.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, however, Kuti got to try out at the Shrine, his
father's celebrated club in Lagos. ``After one song Fela got up and
danced,'' Kuti said. ``Afterward he announced that I was the only
person besides him who knew how to play Afro-beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Fela's fans agree. Some prefer the music of Seun
Kuti, Femi's younger brother, who performs only original Fela songs
with his father's old band, Egypt 80.
</P>
<P>
   Many Nigerians who campaigned for civilian rule say that Kuti
failed to do his part and sold out his father's dream, but as the
son sees it, the struggle ultimately broke his father, who died at
age 58 during the rule of Gen. Sani Abacha, a military strongman
and international pariah. ``He spent his whole life fighting the
system and nothing changed,'' Kuti said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Kuti founded a political awareness group called MASS,
the Movement Against Second Slavery, which he insists is not like
the political party his father started in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Fela could not accept that Africans gained independence in the
1960s only to have their own leaders oppress them and steal their
riches, his son said. But those of the sons' generation have known
no other reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the worst years we mostly found ways to get by,'' Kuti
said, ``and it is that resourcefulness that we are trying to build
on.''
</P>
<P>
   As MASS's spokesman, Folarin Williams, put it, ``The revolution
cannot be won on the streets. That is where the army and the
government are strongest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuti said his life style was also different from his father's.
His father had 27 wives and refused to use condoms, contending that
they were part of a conspiracy by whites to prevent black men from
enjoying sex.
</P>
<P>
   His son has one wife, whom he said he is faithful to ``95 to 90
percent of the time.'' When he is not, he said, he always uses a
condom. One thing he has learned, he explained, is that ``if you
don't adapt, you die.''

D/FW AIRPORT BATTLING IMAGE PROBLEMS AMID SOME USERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   D/FW AIRPORT _ Atlanta businessman Ron Hartley hates Dallas/Fort
Worth Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joke among passengers is that it takes longer to taxi to
the gate than it takes to fly to D/FW in the first place,'' Hartley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other frequent complaints are about the difficulty of changing
gates for a connecting flight and the wait for baggage at claim
areas.
</P>
<P>
   D/FW has fans, too. They primarily are North Texas residents who
appreciate the convenience of parking near their gates, which isn't
possible at many airports.
</P>
<P>
   But D/FW's ranking among world airports has slipped, and part of
the reason may be its image problems, airport officials say. Once
projected by most aviation industry experts to become the world's
busiest airport by 2000, D/FW was No. 3 in total passengers for two
years after losing the No. 2 ranking to Atlanta Hartsfield Airport.
It then dropped to fifth place in 1998 behind O'Hare, Hartsfield,
Los Angeles International and London Heathrow airports. In flight
operations, Chicago and Atlanta led the pack.
</P>
<P>
   In May this year, the most recent month for which figures are
available, D/FW's passenger count was down 2.8 percent from May
1998, according to the airport's Performance Assessment Report
distributed to the D/FW Airport Board on July 1. Industrywide,
airline passenger counts increased 0.6 percent, according to the
Air Transport Association, which includes the nation's major
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a troubling decrease of 4.9 percent in flight
operations from 1995 to '98,'' D/FW Deputy Executive Director Kevin
Cox said. ``That's not a good trend for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Major improvements to help D/FW grow and to address key problems
are planned. But officials say those changes are stalled because of
a dispute involving Dallas Love Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the areas where we have need for massive funding are
awaiting resolution of these regional aviation issues,'' D/FW
Executive Director Jeff Fegan said.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials say that the airport's design and some
antiquated systems irritate some travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting passengers often find the horseshoe-shaped terminal
layout a challenge, especially because the airport's dominant
carrier, American Airlines, operates at three terminals.
</P>
<P>
   The airport was built that way because, when it opened in 1974,
it was intended to serve area passengers. Airlines didn't begin the
hub-and-spoke operations that bring millions of connecting
passengers to D/FW until after the federal government deregulated
the industry in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two-thirds of American's customers at D/FW connect to
another flight, said John Hotard, an American spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The chief problem for connecting passengers is the slow and
often troublesome tram system that moves passengers among
terminals. Built in the early 1970s, the Airport Train is a one-way
system that takes 20 minutes or more to make a loop of the terminal
area. The automated system is so obsolete that many replacement
parts are unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   The taxiing problem, which can mean delays of 15 minutes or more
in reaching a gate after landing, is partly because many flights
land on the airport's west side and must taxi across busy runways
and bridges to reach east-side terminals. Terminals A, C and E, the
busiest, are east of International Parkway. Only Terminal B is on
the west side.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines say they do their best to move luggage from planes to
the baggage claim carousels as quickly as possible, but they blame
the airport layout for the delays that customers perceive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most airports, you have to make a 10-minute walk just to
reach the bag-claim area,'' Hotard said. ``During that time, the
ground crews are taking the bags off the plane and getting them to
the claim area. At D/FW, people walk off the plane and are at
baggage claim within a few yards. Of course there is going to be a
wait. It takes time to get all the bags off the airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Fegan and his staff outlined a new master plan to the airport
board in May 1998 that calls for $5 billion in projects during the
next few years. First on the list is a $700 million people mover
system.
</P>
<P>
   As for long taxiing times, the airport plans to build perimeter
taxiways _ a series of routes around the ends of the runways _ so
planes won't have to cross other runways to get to terminals or
remote runways.
</P>
<P>
   But all these projects are on hold because of the 2-year-old
legal dispute between the airport's owner cities, Fort Worth and
Dallas, about the possible expansion of airline service at Love
Field in Dallas. Because of legal concerns, the matter has stopped
D/FW from issuing bonds to finance even the first project.
</P>
<P>
   D/FW officials said that even if the Love Field dispute isn't
settled soon, they will take their request for about $2.1 billion
worth of projects to the Fort Worth and Dallas city councils this
year to seek approval of a bond issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we need to do,'' Fegan said. ``We're ready to
make the investment.''

WHAT WOULD GOD WATCH? PAX THINKS IT KNOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ When Pax Net arrived here for the industry's
annual presentation of fall programming, many of the 150 television
critics had already adjourned to the hotel pool. And with Pax
introducing stars like Suki Kaiser, Michelle Rene Thomas and
Spencer Rochfort, the usually star-starved paparazzi didn't even
bother showing up.
</P>
<P>
   For a network whose symbols include doves and white clouds, and
whose show scripts are sent back to writers if they fail a
spirituality litmus test, Pax has had a difficult time convincing
viewers and industry analysts that it's not some wacky cult with a
broadcast signal.
</P>
<P>
   Or, perhaps, worse: a network so gung-ho about its spiritual
values that the quality of its productions ranks somewhere between
a high school play and cable-access TV.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Pax audience might rival that of a cable-access
show. As it closes in on next month's one-year anniversary, Pax
remains a tiny morsel of a network, one whose highest-rated program
is ``It's a Miracle,'' a reality series devoted to the
investigation of miracles. It draws fewer than 1 million viewers
per show.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 700,000 viewers are tuning in to Pax at any given
time on weekdays, even though most of its schedule is filled with
major-network reruns. This means Pax as a network ranks behind the
most ratings-challenged series on UPN, a network having so much
trouble it seems on a continual death watch.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question for Pax: Why bother?
</P>
<P>
   But creator Bud Paxson has always considered Pax to be divinely
inspired. He built the network with the purpose of filling the
airwaves with family-friendly programming, a radical idea when you
consider a TV landscape in which success is based largely on shows
filled with sexual relationships, crassness and vulgarity.
</P>
<P>
   If the networks are indeed youth-obsessed and focused on pushing
taste boundaries (in one new WB sitcom, a mother answers the door
topless, and in the midseason CBS mob series Falcone, a man is
brutally stabbed to death), Paxson believes Pax could successfully
position itself as the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the older viewers first fell away when the networks
decided to get rid of them, and then the families fell away,'' says
Jeff Sagansky, president and CEO of Pax, and former entertainment
president of CBS. ``And the decline of family viewing has far
outpaced general audience viewing, because there's nothing for them
to watch. And this season, you're going to see a falloff of
minority viewing, because there's not going to be enough there for
them, either.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing in Pax's many acquisitions of network shows
(''Eight Is Enough,'' ``Highway to Heaven,'' to name two) or its
originals to suggest that it cares about cultural diversity either.
</P>
<P>
   But Sagansky is right in pointing out that if viewers so craved
``cutting-edge'' TV, then the highest-rated series on the WB
wouldn't be the family-friendly ``7th Heaven.'' And on CBS, it
wouldn't be ``Touched by an Angel,'' the only TV series with God as
a regular cast member.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the networks downplay Pax's very existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's nothing more than a cable channel,'' says the
WB's CEO, Jamie Kellner. ``It won't be much of a threat to anyone
until it moves away from network reruns and moves toward original
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the plan. Beginning next month, Pax offers a pair of
original one-hour dramas, an hourlong anthology series and a
variety show featuring secular music. The series will join the
network's two returning original series, ``It's a Miracle'' and
``Little Men,'' the drama inspired by the writings of Louisa May
Alcott.
</P>
<P>
   Sagansky's favorite is ``Destination Stardom,'' a revamped
``Star Search'' set in Hawaii and showcasing contestants vying for
prizes in various categories, from vocalists to family acts. It's
hosted by ``Entertainment Tonight's'' bubbly Lisa Canning, and
produced by Al Masini of ``Solid Gold'' and ``Star Search'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Soup for the Soul'' is another Sagansky possibility.
It's a drama that will bring to life the books by authors Jack
Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen that focus on hope and inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The series with the most promise is ``Hope Island,'' a drama
that easily stands up to anything screened here thus far. Slated
for Sundays beginning Sept. 12, ``Hope Island'' is set in a
seafaring town and filled with quirky characters brought to life by
the whimsical performances of a host of unknown actors. (You could
say it's ``Northern Exposure'' with spirituality.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope Island'' explores a variety of family-oriented themes _
its pilot episode alone deals with the challenges of raising
children, maintaining a sense of family, loyalty and fighting for
one's faith and beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   No Pax series makes it on the air without Sagansky asking: Would
God watch this? (Although ``Destination Stardom'' proves that some
programs do make it on the air without obvious spirituality.)
</P>
<P>
   For all its wholesome qualities, Pax is still a business. How it
manages financially with so few viewers is evident in its cost
structure. Rather than develop 100 scripts and produce 30 pilots as
networks do, Pax hones in on a few shows that it is determined to
do. (Getting unknown, low-priced actors also helps the bottom
line.)
</P>
<P>
   And since Pax owns a chain of television stations, it generates
revenue from both national and local advertising spots.
</P>
<P>
   Pax has also done well in positioning its channel on cable
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Where Pax spends money is on marketing and promotion _ $40
million this year alone, according to Sagansky. John DeRoche,
general sales manager of KPXD, the Pax station in the Fort
Worth-Dallas market, has also partnered with radio stations,
Christian and secular, to draw more eyeballs to Pax.
</P>
<P>
   At a reception after its presentation, Sagansky didn't seem
fazed by the low turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all unexplored territory, we know,'' he said. ``Our
challenge isn't getting people to watch, because we're certain that
that will occur as long as we do this and still make it
entertaining, make it dramatic, make it moving. People will come.''

CANADIAN GAVE LITERARY ROOTS TO SOAP OPERA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The subject is soap opera of the literary kind.
</P>
<P>
   The genre endures healthy in the marketplace. Danielle Steel has
worn the commercial crown more than two decades, producing novels
on an average of one every eight months. Knocking Steel is a vested
fashion of literary snobbery. It speaks no disrespect of Steel to
suggest, as I do, that better soap opera has been written _ if not,
perhaps, lately.
</P>
<P>
   I offer a candidate title for the mythical crown as best soap
opera ever delivered in the form of a novel. It goes back 72 years,
and was already an old book when I encountered it in, I believe,
the early 1950s. The author was a Canadian woman by the arresting
name of Mazo de la Roche. Research confirms that her ``Jalna'' was
the talk of the book world in 1927, a sensational seller not only
in her own country, but in the United States, Great Britain, Europe
and the Orient. More than that, it was a considerable critical
success and copped the ``Atlantic Monthly'' prize as the year's
best novel published in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jalna'' is the name of a family estate in Ontario. The family
name is Whiteoak, and many bear the name. I could confuse and
bewilder any reader by enumerating them by name and familial
relationships, even if I could remember them all, and their
intertwined personal dramas. That's the essence of soap opera. Much
ado among many people, the closer-connected the better. If you want
a good laugh, just read in this newspaper the weekly summaries of
happenings in the popular TV soaps.
</P>
<P>
   There's melodrama aplenty, there's romance and marriage and
infidelity and misunderstanding, and there's outright villainy.
Courtroom trials are a staple of the genre, with the wronged person
usually acquitted, mercifully, to conclude what would be a chapter
if it were in a book. Another convention of soap opera in any form
is the triangle consisting of two strong women (one good, one bad)
contending for an easily manipulated man who really isn't worth
their trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Mazo de la Roche may have addressed ``Jalna'' and its many
sequels to a feminine readership, and her women are more
resourceful than the men. Yet ``Jalna'' captured a substantial male
audience, and was passed around the family, especially when the
family identified with the affluent Whiteoaks, if only wishfully.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jalna,'' something is always happening or is about to. It
is chessboard movement involving dozens of characters, most of whom
are in the family. Some are trying to get into the Whiteoak clan,
others seeking desperately to escape. The author writes clearly,
imparting individual distinctions to her large cast, so the reader
usually understands who's who and doing what. And the goings-on at
the old plantation are rather spirited.
</P>
<P>
   Mazo de la Roche decided she had a good thing going, and began
cranking out the sequels, introducing still more Whiteoaks along
the way. Eventually there were more than a dozen works in the
series, usually getting the estate into the title (''Whiteoaks of
Jalna,'' e.g.); and the succession obeyed the law of diminishing
returns. I read only the first installment; that was enough. Yet
faithful thousands just couldn't get enough of the Whiteoaks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a safe bet that ``Jalna'' is superior to its progeny, not
only for its original imagination, but for its wonderfully
convoluted design. It is sagalike, giving background to the family
history, and revealing via flashbacks its most disarming character
_ feisty Grandma Whiteoak, almost 100 _ in her romantic youth.

   The original ``Jalna'' remains in print, and I'm told that most
of the books still get considerable play in the public libraries.
So if literary soap opera is your suppressed desire ...

   KOSOVO-SOLDIERS (Leskovac, Yugoslavia) _ Life at war was
exhilarating and terrifying, and life afterwards is pallid and full
of worries, especially in a war-broken, sanctions-battered economy,
say men like Vlada, 31, who fought with the Yugoslav army. He and
other soldiers have taken part in the daily demonstrations of army
reservists in Leskovac for their back pay and for the resignation
of President Slobodan Milosevic. There is fury here, but it is
unfocused, a tinder box waiting for a leader and a spark. By Steven

   KOCH-DETECTIVES (Wichita, Kan.) _ One of America's wealthiest

   CALIF-DANGEROUS-SCHOOL (Los Angeles) _ It looms on a lonely lot
at the edge of downtown, a hulking pile of buff brick and brown

at a cost of more than $200 million, but now the Belmont Learning
Center may never be finished _ and if it is, no one may want to go

`FROM A HIGH PLACE': UNEVEN TALE OF AN ARTIST IN A BORROWED LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(yn) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lives of great artists tend to be overshadowed by their art.
It's a measure of their greatness that we don't really care who
they were. We have our esthetic experiences first and ask questions
later. The answers only rarely trigger a reassessment.
</P>
<P>
   But some artists are more overshadowed than others, and among
outstanding 20th-century painters, few are more obscure than the
American Abstract Expressionist Arshile Gorky, the Armenian youth
who, as Vostanig Adoian, arrived in the United States in 1920
determined to become an important painter.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 20 years, he created an almost completely false
persona that variously included a Russian background, kinship to
Maxim Gorky, study in Paris and a degree in engineering from Brown
University. (This disguise was so complete that Gorky's wife, Agnes
Magruder _ whom he nicknamed Mougouch _ did not learn his real name
until nearly a decade after his death.) More important, he entered
a dogged apprenticeship to the styles of European masters like
Ingres, Cezanne and finally Picasso and Miro. And he spent a great
of time talking, hashing over artistic issues, especially with his
closest friends, Stuart Davis, John Graham and de Kooning.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1940s, his goal was in sight. Contact with the
European Surrealists who were sitting out World War II in New York
(most notably Andre Breton, the style's autocratic leader, and the
painter Roberto Matta) and two summers spent drawing the lush
landscape of northern Virginia (at his in-laws' summer retreat),
brought a sudden ripening of his art. Basically he took Surrealist
automatist drawing and pointed it in a new direction, adding color,
scale, body and physical accident and an emotional fervor it had
never previously possessed. The example of his liberated line
alternating with clouds and plumes of hothouse color _ conjuring an
abstracted, ecstatic, eroticized vision of nature _ was not lost on
de Kooning, Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, or later on Cy
Twombly.
</P>
<P>
   But just as success loomed, disaster struck and struck again.
Gorky's misfortunes included colon cancer, a fire that destroyed a
studio full of new paintings and drawings, a car accident that
broke several vertebrae in his neck and left him in excruciating
pain, and an estrangement from his wife and two young daughters
that left him in despair. In July 1948, alone on his family's
rented farm near Sherman, Conn., Gorky went to a small shed and
hanged himself. His final words, scrawled onto a small blackboard,
were ``Goodbye my loves.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorky's tragic end echoed a beginning so horrific that, as
Matthew Spender argues in his alternatively illuminating and
tedious biography of the artist, it could ultimately neither be
faced nor shared. The poor farmers of northeastern Armenia
inhabited an idyllic landscape on the shores of Lake Van, living
close to nature but also in continuous fear of persecution by the
Turks. The Turks began their most savage campaign in 1915, a series
of massacres, sackings, sieges, forced marches and political
betrayal that count as the 20th-century's first genocide. Gorky and
his sister, Vartoosh, endured this chaos for four years, but
watched their mother succumb to a paralyzing depression and death.
</P>
<P>
   Irritating and plodding as it can sometimes be, Spender's book
is a gift to anyone interested in 20th-century American art. He has
been married since 1967 to Gorky's elder daughter, Maro, and his
access to both people and papers has enabled him to separate fact
from fiction as never before. He untangles the protective web of
lies that Gorky wove around himself and in the process tells a
story and presents a truth that is even more staggering.
</P>
<P>
   The book drags along for great stretches of time, spelling out
the intricacies of Gorky's ancestry and the simplicity of village
life in Armenia, the network of surviving family members who ended
up in the United States, the ups and mostly downs of Gorky's
pursuit of love and the development of his art. Spender seems to
have packed every available shred of family memory into his
narrative, which contributes to the slowness. And he doesn't have
much feeling for Gorky's art or its fits-and-starts development.
(Although the absence of color reproductions doesn't help.) The
pace quickens here and there, especially in portions based on the
reminiscences of de Kooning and Davis, or others who were close.
</P>
<P>
   But as the book builds toward its harrowing finish, things
become clearer and clearer. Spender is telling the story of an
outsider, an autodidact in the extreme who came from a world that
was not only rural and Eastern European (like that of Chagall and
Soutine) but in many ways medieval. That Gorky made his way in the
United States at all, much less to the forefront of 20th-century
art, is an astounding testament to his will, intelligence and
innate sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Spender makes sure that we understand the great stress that the
assimilation effort placed on the artist and those around him,
especially his devoted Mougouch. And in the end he also shows us
that parts of Gorky remained unassimilated, hampering him
throughout his career and becoming intransigent and crippling as
his health deteriorated: his chauvinism toward women, his
uncommunicativeness, his inordinate pride and sense of privacy, and
his perhaps understandable tendencies toward violence and paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   It makes painful reading. Spender describes those last several
days during which Gorky, in physical pain, distraught about his
marriage and destabilized by pain killers, roamed the streets of
New York, calling up friends and making strange requests that no
one could quite respond to, while Mougouch waited by the phone in
Virginia. But it did seem that a time bomb set years ago in Armenia
had finally gone off.
</P>
<P>
   To a great extent the final explosion casts Spender's own book
in a different light, giving it a meaning and a momentum that it
lacks during the actual reading. It does not obscure the fact that
both the artist and his art deserve a more psychologically and
esthetically perceptive account. But Spender has provided an
essential foundation that is, for all its flaws, also
unforgettable.

YUGOSLAV SOLDIERS NOW FIGHT FOR BACK PAY AND BREAD

   LESKOVAC, Yugoslavia _ Vlada sleeps late and often doesn't
bother to shave. He says he has stopped talking in his sleep, but
often finds himself shuddering uncontrollably, staring down at his
trembling body as if it belonged to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   His business as an artisan is suffering, but he is forgiving
people their debts, because he knows they have no money to spare.
``I'm satisfied with small things now,'' he said, licking the paper
on a cheap Drina cigarette, so it would burn longer. ``I want to
make a lot of friends and not argue over anything petty. But if
there's a car accident and there are dead _ I'm utterly
indifferent.''
</P>
<P>
   Vlada, 31, was a unit commander of the Yugoslav army in Kosovo.
He hated it, but he's proud that he passed through, and he thinks
he has kept his soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was awful in Kosovo,'' he said. ``It was full of
horrible things. Not on the level of massacres, not that I saw
happening, at least, but there was nothing good. I think of myself
as a form of pacifist, and even going there was horrible enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was ethnic purging, and some of his men helped carry
it out. They held the ground while police and paramilitaries moved
through villages, killing and expelling Albanians, then secured the
villages afterward. They looted freely and burned houses and stood
by while others did the dirtiest work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a war down there, and the main thing was to stay
alive,'' Vlada said. ``Mostly when I arrived the cleansing was
done, and it was done by police and paramilitaries, and it was
awful and stupid. We soldiers are softer, we are not murderers, and
it's an ugly thing to say, but those guys did a job for us, and if
we did it we would have a lot more dead on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his men spent 60 days without water or electricity,
usually sleeping on the floor of an abandoned or cleansed Albanian
house in the hills, moving between Gnjilane and Kacanik. They drank
water from which they removed the tadpoles and dumped in purifying
tablets.
</P>
<P>
   Vlada watched his friends crack up or die or turn into avid
looters or killers. They dug in against NATO bombing, and they
lived with the constant fear of being uniformed soldiers in a
hostile countryside facing a peasant army. It wasn't just the
Kosovo Liberation Army, for whom Vlada has only marginal respect,
but of booby-traps and ambushes and almost any Albanian civilian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dangerous to turn your back, even on an old lady,'' he
said. ``You always had your gun in your hands or within reach.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the story of an Albanian in civilian clothes walking
toward a Serb soldier, who approached him, while two uniformed
Albanian fighters shot from an ambush. ``It was a tactic,'' Vlada
said. ``And the guy who didn't shoot was a fool, and his family is
without him. But if he shot first, then he's a murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   He rubbed his face and licked another Drina.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was mobilized, I went to church and prayed for two
things,'' he said. ``First, not to kill anyone. And second, to come
back alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the first prayer was answered, he said. At least he thinks
so.
</P>
<P>
   But then he tells the story of three members of his unit who
killed three Albanian fighters at close range at the end of the
war. ``Each one thinks he didn't kill someone,'' Vlada said. ``But
those guys had so many bullets in them, each one must have hit them
all.''
</P>
<P>
   He commanded a small unit of 14 or so soldiers who patrolled,
and ``we became very good,'' he said with some pride. ``We
protected each other and we were faithful to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of looting, he said. ``In the beginning, it was
silently licensed by the officers, under the theory, `Take what you
need or want and use it when you're here.' Then people got crazy
and took a lot of things. The first thing stolen from a house was
the television. Our unit sometimes had seven sets, but of course
there was no electricity,'' he said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   And there was no way to bring the loot back, except for the
officers, who had access to trucks. So there was a lot of
destruction, too, especially of expensive things like televisions,
video recorders, refrigerators and tractors.
</P>
<P>
   About the expulsion and murder of Albanian citizens, his stories
track with those of others. In general, the army held the ground;
special police units and paramilitary units, sometimes with long
hair, beards and bandanas, like actors in Hollywood movies, cleared
the villages, often killing those who resisted leaving; the
civilians were channeled along certain roads toward buses or the
border; bodies were often cleared out by other police units; and
then the army checked through the villages again.
</P>
<P>
   But there was some army involvement. For these special actions,
``to expel or cleanse or whatever you say,'' Vlada said another
officer would come to collect two men, who would be gone for 48
hours or so.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers mostly kept away from the paramilitaries and
special police units, particularly the legendary ``Frenki's boys,''
named after a former commander of the special antiterrorist units
of the police, Franko Simatovic. They are big, well-equipped,
ruthless and ordered to not even discuss their training.
</P>
<P>
   Vlada described the clearing of Zegra, south of Gnjilane.
``About 260 of them cleaned Zegra in 12 hours, 6,000 to 7,000
people. They took about a minute a house. There was shooting. The
volunteers got to the center of town and started to shoot the first
people to come to them. The whole village heard this and people
started to run away on their own, and there were police to guide
them toward Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they went into the houses, looking for people, and
sometimes Albanian fighters remained and there were firefights.
``Soldiers couldn't do that,'' Vlada insisted. ``It would have
taken us three days to do all the houses. Soldiers couldn't just go
into a house and start shooting all the people in the house right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped, sighed, continued. ``It was ugly but it happened,
and everyone you saw felt like an enemy. It's the worst kind of
war. A granny could have a grenade. The first blood demands second
blood, revenge, and so it goes. The KLA had their positions and
their bunkers themselves, and as we were drafted, so were they, and
their orders were to stay and cause trouble, and many of them were
sacrificed.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, he said, some people liked the killing. ``You find
out a lot about people in 24 hours in a war,'' he said. He
described clearing a house in a village where there were elderly
Albanians still inside. One man went in while he and another
soldier kept guard over the house, when another group of Serbs
arrived, pulling out knives and wanting to kill the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are my Albanians, and if you want to kill Albanians you
go catch them in some other house,'' Vlada told them. ``But I was
scared. It was stupid. We were yelling and nearly shooting each
other and we were all targets, and if someone was hiding in the
stable he could have killed us all.''
</P>
<P>
   They burned many houses, ``especially the big, rich ones,''
Vlada said. ``If we got in a house where we found KLA insignia, or
uniforms or pictures of men in KLA uniforms with arms, you cannot
stay calm. They are not the only ones guilty for this war, but they
are among them. And a lot were in big houses, with Jacuzzis, and
Albanian flags, when 70 percent of those in Albania don't have
electricity, and you can't be calm. There's rage in you and you ask
yourself, what more does he want than this? There is no sign inside
of this country, but only of another country, and it burns.''
</P>
<P>
   He became mystical about the houses, he said. ``Sometimes, they
won't burn, even with oil. It's like the house protects itself,''
he said. ``Then I thought, `This is the house of honest people,'
and I ordered, `Leave this house alone, you can see it won't
burn.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Serbs thought the Albanians would never be back to
demand an accounting, Vlada sighed. ``People thought there would be
some deal with NATO or a partition of Kosovo or something. They
were stupid. You can't clean out 2 million people or kill 100,000
people, but some thought you could. There were a lot of army and
police, and you had the weapons, and the Albanians were too few and
poor. And without NATO, they could have done nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Life at war was exhilarating and terrifying, full of adrenaline
and sensation, and life afterwards is pallid and full of worries,
especially in a war-broken, sanctions-broken economy where money,
gasoline, sugar and even cooking oil are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Vlada has taken part in the daily demonstrations of army
reservists in Leskovac for their back pay and for the resignation
of President Slobodan Milosevic. His experience is typical of many
of the reservists interviewed, but he was a commander and more
insightful than most. There is fury here, but unfocused, a tinder
box waiting for a leader and a spark. But the daily demonstrations
are dwindling, last only about 15 minutes, and often no one even
speaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's apathy,'' Vlada said. ``There are lots of problems to
deal with, daily things like money and bread, and like an animal,
you deal with those things only.''
</P>
<P>
   No one here really wants to hear about the war. There are
already a lot of divorces among his friends, he said. ``People
can't talk about it. Your life is awful and you're trying to
survive that. People ask, `How are you?' The answer now is: `Same
as you,' and everyone's face falls.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, he said, ``people feel like the war was two years ago _
they're trying to cope with current problems, trying to get money,
trying to prepare for the winter,'' canning and storing food, when
they can afford it, or cutting wood.
</P>
<P>
   As for questions of war crimes, ``it's the same as in
Belgrade,'' Vlada said. ``No one wants to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't much matter now, he says. ``Kosovo and its
problems are too far away. It's a luxury to think of Kosovo when I
have such problems here. People are so poor that when they go to
the shops they just write IOU's. It makes you feel guilty, you feel
somehow lost, you lose all the self-confidence that you had when
you were there, in Kosovo.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first days after the reservists came home, the police were
absent. Now, with the protests, they cruise around the town, not
just in their little Zastava cars, but big blue four-wheel drive
vehicles with white bars on the windows. Many of them are from
surrounding towns, Vlada says. ``It's good thinking. It's hard to
beat or arrest your neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes now, he says, he dreams that he is being arrested, but
he's not sure for what. ``Not for Kosovo, but because of the
protests, or because I owe money for electricity or whatever,'' he
says. ``But it's a horrible feeling of insecurity, and for all the
reservists it's the same.''
</P>
<P>
   They talk to each other; they go fishing. ``This is like the
golden age of fishing,'' he said. ``It's the cheapest form of
entertainment and escape from reality,'' he said. ``Really, a
perfect escape.''

AFTER 40, LETTING GO OF HAPPILY EVER AFTER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Divorce has been stamped on the lives of Edward
Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, the film and television
writer-directors who created the series ``Thirtysomething.''
Herskovitz was divorced in 1993 after a 15-year marriage and two
children. Zwick's parents were divorced when he was 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mother married for the second time, I was 22 or 23,''
recalled Zwick, who has also directed films like ``Glory,''
``Courage Under Fire'' and ``Legends of the Fall.'' ``I used a
quote from Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav in the Talmud as a toast: `It
is said that marriages are made in heaven, but the Lord above is
not always as wise as we would hope Him to be, which is why second
marriages are made on earth.'''
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated Zwick-Herskovitz television series on ABC,
``Once and Again,'' deals, most assuredly, with earthbound issues
involving two divorced parents (played by Sela Ward and Bill
Campbell) who meet and struggle to figure out how to date while
dealing with their respective teen-age children, former spouses and
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The series is one of the few new shows to actually deal with
grown-ups and grown-up issues _ as opposed to the avalanche of new
series involving roommates in New York or teen-agers overflowing
with angst.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has high hopes for the series. It will be introduced for
seven weeks, starting Sept. 21, at 10 p.m. on Tuesdays in the
choice ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' time slot. When the police show returns
for its premiere, ``Once and Again'' will leave the air and return
in January, but at a different time and possibly on a different
night. (Although the shifting time slots are jarring for viewers,
ABC followed a similar plan with ``The Practice,'' which is now a
hit.)
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Tarses, president of ABC Entertainment, said the network's
enthusiasm for the Zwick-Herskovitz series was based on several
factors. ``Given their track record, they have demonstrated a
particular talent to zero in on whatever the climate of the country
is,'' said Ms. Tarses. ``They sort of understand what's in the air
in terms of what people are feeling and thinking and wondering
about. They're really doing a detailed exploration of a complicated
situation that's more commonplace now than it's ever been before.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tarses said another factor had gone into the network's
decision to proceed with the show. ``It's a genre we haven't seen
before: a slightly older relationship show, people 35 to 40 years
old with children,'' she explained. ``We didn't have anything like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwick, who is 46, and Herskovitz, 47, were seated the other
morning in the sedate Southwest-style offices in Santa Monica of
their production company, Bedford Falls (named after the hometown
of George Bailey, the James Stewart character in Frank Capra's film
``It's a Wonderful Life'').
</P>
<P>
   The two met as students at the American Film Institute in Los
Angeles in the mid-1970s, became television writers after that and
struck gold with ``Thirtysomething,'' which ran on ABC from 1987 to
1991.
</P>
<P>
   That series sharply divided critics, who either adored or
resisted the exploration of marriage, relationships and interior
lives among a self-absorbed and remorselessly serious group of two
couples and three singles. When the show ended, Zwick and
Herskovitz embarked on separate film careers.
</P>
<P>
   They also served as executive producers on two critically
acclaimed if not wildly popular series.
</P>
<P>
   One was ``My So-Called Life'' (1994-95), about a confused,
soulful teen-age girl. The series expired after only 19 episodes,
largely because ABC seemed confused about where to place it. The
show, which stars Claire Danes at the age of 15, was later
resurrected on MTV and has been highly popular in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The other show was ``Relativity'' (1996-97), about a couple
whose chance meeting in Rome leads to a love affair and a
relationship back home in Los Angeles where families collide and
intrude.
</P>
<P>
   Both series had ardent, almost cultish, fans but failed to
generate large audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Are Zwick and Herskovitz then perhaps too idiosyncratic for
television? Are they the darling of television critics and network
executives but not mass audiences? The two men shied away from such
thoughts. Herskovitz said that even ``Thirtysomething'' was never a
ratings hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing about the American television watching
population is that they're happy to watch junk and they're happy to
watch good stuff,'' said Herskovitz. ``They'll watch both. And
they'll recognize the good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men, who will take periodic turns directing the new
series (along with other filmmakers), said their individual
strengths as writers had made the creative marriage work.
Herskovitz said that his partner had ``a remarkable story
structuring ability _ you could drop him anywhere in a story and in
five seconds he would know where it began and how it should end.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwick, on the other hand, said that his partner was unusually
willing to confront deeper and more personal issues on television.
``He was much braver as a writer than I was,'' said Zwick.
</P>
<P>
   In returning to television as a team, the two acknowledged that
while still engaged in movie careers, they have been left
bewildered and frustrated by the business of making feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Especially Herskovitz, whose two films, ``Jack the Bear'' (1992)
and ``Dangerous Beauty'' (1996), fared poorly at the box office.
``You spend at least two years of your life making a movie and
you're creating two hours of entertainment and it's forgotten,''
said Herskovitz. ``Even if it's not the whole story of making
movies, that part of it is unbearable. It's very, very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwick echoed his partner. ``The notion that something may be so
ephemeral as to live or die in a single weekend is frustrating,''
he said. ``Indeed with a television series you can dig into the
culture. You can mouth off on this host of concerns you have. And
the fact that you can penetrate the culture in certain ways can be
very heady.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwick and Herskovitz said that there had, of course, been
classic white-bread sitcoms about couples who bring children into
their marriages like ``The Brady Bunch'' and ``Eight Is Enough.''
But the themes for ``Once and Again,'' which the two began
discussing as far back as the late 1980s, while they were creating
``Thirtysomething,'' are far more sober.
</P>
<P>
   In the new series, Ms. Ward plays a newly single mother who
nervously embarks on a budding relationship with a divorced man
(Campbell) who is as tentative about romance as she is. Both are
consumed with their children: Ms. Ward has two daughters, including
a teen-ager who is overweight and lonely and dismayed, if not
threatened, by her mother's new relationship.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has trouble coping with one of his children's learning
problems. Their former spouses add doses of guilt to the mix. The
issues seem peculiarly real, which is uncommon on network
television series.
</P>
<P>
   A single theme seems to dominate the series: the realization
among 40-somethings that relationships, and life, have limits and
possibilities. ``If you've been through a divorce and you've
reached a certain age, you understand the finiteness of life and
you understand that every choice entails making some other
choice,'' said Herskovitz. ``There's no such thing as living
happily ever after. So you must construct for yourself a life that
makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ward, a one-time model and an Emmy Award-winning actress for
her role on NBC's ``Sisters,'' said she had vowed not to do another
television series largely because it would take so much time away
from her two small children. ``But then I read the pilot and kept
thinking, `I know this woman; I am this woman,''' she said. ``There
are so few roles like this for women _ a role that's complex and
interesting and vulnerable. When I started making this I felt like
I was flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ward identified with the role of Lily, a woman starting over
in a deeply personal way. Ms. Ward, who is 42, has been married for
the last seven years to Howard Sherman, a businessman. Although Ms.
Ward said she had had several earlier long-term relationships that
ended like a series of divorces, it was her experience after
``Sisters'' that led her to identify with the character she plays
in ``Once and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got off `Sisters' after six years and was ready to take on
the world,'' she said. ``The first thing that a film director said
to my agent was, `What I really want is Sela Ward 10 years ago.'
This is, like, when I'm 37. I was stunned. You mean I'm no longer
sexually viable? I'm no longer attractive? It was starting all over
again. And it was not unlike Lily at all.''
</P>
<P>
   For the series Zwick and Herskovitz have hired a top-drawer list
of writers, unusual by television standards. These include
playwrights like Michael Weller (``Moonchildren'') and Donald
Margulies (``Collected Stories'') and the screenwriter Pamela Gray
(``A Walk on the Moon''), as well as television writers from
``Thirtysomething'' like Winnie Holzman, who went on to create ``My
So-Called Life,'' and Richard Kramer, who later wrote the first
``Tales of the City'' mini-series and worked as executive producer
on ``Nothing Sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwick and Herskovitz insisted that that the new show was not
autobiographical or personal _ up to a point. ``I haven't been in a
serious relationship with a woman who has children of her own, for
example,'' said Herskovitz, the taller and lankier and slightly
more reticent member of the team. ``But I've certainly faced the
struggle and also the sort of excitement and possibility and
thinking that there is another chance of finding someone after
you've been divorced. That's been a part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zwick said: ``We are ruthless, we are merciless in our
trading on those things that we see and hear and know, but they're
shaped or mutated in some way; they're transmogrified into
something else. Nothing is true in the interest of everything being
true.''
</P>
<P>
   The show itself came about as part of a series deal between the
creators and two networks, ABC and Fox. The deal involves, among
other issues, Zwick and Herskovitz forgoing considerable up-front
fees in exchange for more than 50 percent of later profits, if
there are any. One of the architects of the deal, Lloyd Braun,
co-chairman of the ABC Entertainment Television Group, said signing
on Zwick and Herskovitz was one of his first priorities last year
when he was named chairman of Walt Disney's Buena Vista Television
Productions. Its subsidiary Touchstone Television produced the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creatively they're as good as it gets,'' said Braun. He said
he was not especially concerned about the sophistication of the
show. ``It's a somewhat sophisticated show that's going to deal
with real life issues,'' he said. ``The hope is that people will
embrace that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Zwick and Herskovitz seem as close as brothers _ they
defer to each other and apologize if one or the other interrupts a
sentence _ the two try, in some ways, to keep out of each other's
way after work. During the making of ``Thirtysomething'' (and since
then) they tacitly decided to create boundaries in their separate
domestic lives to allow each other more breathing space.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements, they said, are handled with surprising ease.
``It's usually about passion,'' Zwick said. ``In other words,
whoever feels the strongest usually wins.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems to mark the relationship, too, is the ability of both
men to criticize each other's work bluntly. ``The more successful
you are in this business, the fewer people there are who are
willing to tell you the truth about anything _ particularly about
your work,'' said Zwick. ``And to have someone upon whom you count
tell you that it could be better, tell you that you didn't go deep
enough, you didn't go far enough, tell you that you made a misstep
is precious and rare.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the two men, and their writers, are writing and
rewriting scripts that are set to go into production over the next
few weeks. What are the major concerns of the team?
</P>
<P>
   ``We think about the fact that there are a lot of divorced
people in this country and a lot of children of divorce, so we
imagined that there's a constituency out there that might enjoy the
show,'' said Herskovitz. ``Our concerns are more personal than
that. It's like, Will we look like idiots? Will we be foolish? Will
we run out of stories after 10 episodes? Will it be something we're
proud of?''
</P>
<P>
   But Herskovitz said that the actual success or failure of the
show was now out of the hands of the team. ``Whether it's a success
or not,'' he said, ``we feel, somehow, that it's up to the gods in
some way.''

 &HT;    What happened to black families on network TV?
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crabby junkyard dog Fred Sanford is long gone. So is
``movin'-on-up'' rich guy George Jefferson. Even America's favorite
dad, lovable Dr. Cliff Huxtable, is but a fond memory.
</P>
<P>
   The television landscape has been turning a whiter shade of pale
for several seasons, and come fall, America's real-life diversity
will be reflected more in commercials than in prime-time
entertainment on the four major networks.
</P>
<P>
   NAACP President Kweisi Mfume recently criticized the major
networks for the ``virtual whitewash'' of their new fall
programming, drawing attention to a problem that's been smoldering
for years. Actually three new shows do feature minority characters
in prominent roles, but the spirit of Mfume's charge is clearly
valid.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few existing ensemble dramas feature diverse casts
and one major network sitcom (ABC's ``The Hughleys'') is largely
African American, most series with minority leads are congregated
on so-called ``weblets'' WB and UPN and on niche cable networks
like BET and Univision.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be named a niche market is to have your isolation from
mainstream underscored,'' said Timothy Burke, who teaches African
history and popular culture at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is this segregation splitting programming, it's
splitting audiences as well. A survey last year by New York ad
agency BBDO found only four crossovers in the Top 15 favorite shows
among black and white households _ ``Monday Night Football,''
``Touched by an Angel,'' ``60 Minutes'' and the ``CBS Sunday
Movie.'' None has a predominantly minority cast.
</P>
<P>
   The top three shows in black households _ the WB's sitcoms ``The
Steve Harvey Show,'' ``The Jamie Foxx Show'' and ``For Your Love''
_ are at the very bottom of preferences among white households.
Black households feel similarly indisposed toward white favorites
``Friends,'' ``Frasier'' and ``Veronica's Closet.''
</P>
<P>
   But is television causing this pop culture split or merely
reflecting the racial divide that already exists?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think television is simply reacting to an aggressive mental
apartheid,'' Burke said. ``It's reflecting culture in that it's
harder and harder for some people to imagine they'd find the lives
of black characters interesting, and that speaks to a hardening of
attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees with that theory. Advertisers and
agencies defend the networks, claiming trends are prompted by
economic goals, not social prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings don't portend any broadening of the racial
divide,'' said Doug Alligood, author of BBDO's survey and senior
vice president for special markets. ``What they do reflect is a
maturing of the television medium in which viewers, particularly
black viewers, have more network programs to choose from than ever
before that are in synch with the style, language and attitudes
that have been called the 'black experience.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of sheer numbers on all networks, Alligood is right,
but in terms of programs on the major networks and programs that
will appeal to a crossover audience, television has lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   After a rocky start in the early '50s with over-the-top sitcoms
like ``Amos and Andy'' and ``Beulah,'' the high point came in the
mid-'70s when ``Sanford &AMP; Son,'' ``Chico and the Man,'' ``The
Jeffersons'' and ``Good Times'' were in the Top 10 programs. And
the No. 1 show at the time, ``All in the Family,'' dealt with
racial themes on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest crossover hit in TV history was ``The Cosby Show,''
which zoomed to No. 1 in 1984 and stayed there for several seasons.
Some segments of the African-American community criticized the show
for not being ``black enough,'' but ``Cosby'' was a huge hit among
all demographics and was lavishly praised by most blacks and
whites.
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been a ``Cosby''-style hit since. And what bothers
many observers most is why there isn't a mixed-cast sitcom like
``Friends.'' It seems unrealistic to have so many New York-based
comedies with all-white casts, and yet there are probably many
young whites who don't have any black friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a hard time sometimes figuring out whether we want
popular culture to reflect our best selves or our realistic
selves,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be even more all-white shows come fall since the
networks are targeting white teen-agers in a big way. They want
teen eyeballs because advertisers want teenagers' present and
future bucks. Not wanting to seem insensitive, the networks concede
they need more diversity, but they don't seem particularly eager to
do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   CBS President Leslie Moonves issued a response to Mfume's
charges, saying he agreed that the entertainment industry should
``make sure the characters on our screen reflect the diversity of
the population as a whole.'' ABC entertainment President Jamie
Tarses had a similar response, adding that her network planned to
introduce a few minority characters on the new shows before they
debut in September.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in response to Mfume's blast, accompanied by the threat
of legal action and a boycott, NBC, home of many white comedies,
recently announced a midseason ``Seinfeld'' spinoff featuring the
Johnny Cochran-inspired lawyer Jackie Chiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do these people believe minority shows won't succeed?''
asked Curtis Simons, executive vice president of marketing for
cable's Black Entertainment Network. ``African Americans watch more
television than any other segment of the population, but there's no
programming that reflects the culture (of the people) who really
want to watch. The networks have gotten very selfish about where
they are in today's world. They're going to get their advertising
dollars, and they think they'll get African Americans anyway
because they watch so much TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable and the smaller networks have gone after minority viewers,
and that's one reason the bigger networks have lost viewers. The
WB, with lots of African-American programs, is the fastest-growing
commercial network, and Univision, which caters to Spanish-speaking
viewers, is the fastest-growing cable network.
</P>
<P>
   Racial divisions are considerably less pronounced in music and
movies, where minority performers have been embraced by young
whites. For example, black entertainers Chris Rock and Brandi are
wildly popular. Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin didn't get to be
the phenomenon he is today by appealing only to Latinos, and rap
and hip-hop exploded a few years ago thanks to popularity among
white teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been the trend-setters in entertainment and
sports,'' Simons said. ``But a lot of the TV shows that are pitched
to the networks by minorities aren't even looked at because the
people at the top aren't sensitive to the culture. How many black
executives are at the Big Four? None. The only way to make changes
is at the top, and these guys have too much money to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe we should be concentrating on quality rather than
quantity. Maybe counting faces is a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be worried, but our worries should be more
complex,'' Burke said. ``To say we need more black faces on TV
starts the debate on the wrong foot, reducing it to numbers. We
know the networks can rush out a couple of shows to counter the
criticism. It's easy to get a pencil and color in some character's
face, but that doesn't alter the way TV reflects reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are fewer predominantly minority shows on the major
networks, but the ones that are there do a better job of presenting
complex issues of race. NBC's ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' was
a master at depicting tough racial situations in raw, realistic
terms. ``ER,'' ``NYPD Blue'' and ``Law &AMP; Order'' also tackle tough
subjects with stark realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are quite a few dramas that are complex in the way they
talk about race, and that's progress,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy is a different matter. Young whites, who think nothing of
``affecting blackness as a style statement,'' according to Burke,
are uncomfortable watching a domestic sitcom about black people
``because they'd have to watch black people acting black. In the
world of the WB sitcom, there aren't any white kids acting black.''
</P>
<P>
   Will this racial divide ever end? Hoping to influence the
networks, Mfume last week bought $20,000 worth of stock in the
companies that own the four major networks. That's not much, but it
might give him an insider's voice.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the divide could end in the blink of an eye. All it
takes is one big crossover hit, and then all the networks will
splash rip-offs across their prime-time schedules. Whether they
will deal realistically or fantastically with race relations as
they exist is another matter. If the shows are realistic, like
``Homicide,'' history tells us their crossover appeal is very much
in question.

country's second largest state, which used to rank near the bottom

and testing to increasing state funding of public schools. But he's
been unable to deliver on vouchers, and some critics say he cannot
take credit for the recent rise. The seeds of Texas'success were

EVEN WITH AGE, IT'S STILL NOT EASY TO GET OVER HILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Honey,'' I whispered after scanning the large crowd, ``I think
we're the oldest couple here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' my spouse replied confidently. ``I'm sure there are a
lot of people here our age or even older.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are they?'' I asked. I silently directed his gaze to the
stream of fashion-conscious youngsters parading before us. He was
about to respond when a gorgeous waif in a bikini passed by. ``What
woman?'' he actually said with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, hello? The Tyra Banks look-alike with the skin-tight
shorts.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, she was wearing a shorts set, I suppose, but for
all intents and purposes, it was just a red bikini. Every head,
male and female, within a half-mile turned to watch her progress as
she slithered by on 10-inch heels _ every head but my husband's.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, he did not rotate his head or drop his jaw, but I
swear I saw his right eye burrow backward into his brain and peek
out of his ear canal as she passed. That's quite a trick. When I
have some spare time, I'm going to sign him up for the carnival
side show. Imagine his relief when I commented, ``Did you see that
woman?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't notice, dear, but you're certainly looking lovely
this evening.''
</P>
<P>
   I should have taken a cue from my mother and skipped the
concert, but I just love Lauryn Hill. Even before her platinum
album and all the Grammys, I was a big fan. There was no way she
could perform a concert in Dallas without me being present. I've
listened to her CD so many times that she's almost like my friend,
you know.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, when I bought the tickets, I called my mother all
excited and stuff and I said, ``Mom, guess what? We're going to the
Lauryn Hill concert. The tickets went on sale today, and I got some
great seats.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother has a limited repertoire of contemporary artists, but
Lauryn Hill is so unusual that she transcends generation gaps. That
was my feeling, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she related to Lauren Bacall?'' my mother said. ``I like
Lauren Bacall. I saw her in `Mommie Dearest,' and she was so
good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom. I think that was Joan Crawford, or Faye Dunaway playing
Joan Crawford; and no, Lauryn Hill is not related to Lauren Bacall.
Lauryn Hill is African-American and she's a singer, not an
actress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an album by Joan Crawford that I used to play all the
time. Don't you remember? And they could be related. I was reading
an article about Thomas Jefferson and his descendants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama, please! That was Joan Baez on your album. Bacall and
Hill! They don't even have the same last name. I'm sure they're not
related. I just need for you to please, please baby-sit that night
and don't play that album; the boys hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   See, that was a sign. A bad sign. I will not go to any more
concerts unless my mother knows the artist, and then I won't have
to hear opening acts like Outkast. Don't get me wrong. I like
positive rap, and I'm sure they were good rappers. They were
certainly loud enough. I just didn't understand a word they said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, I turned to my husband and yelled, ``I hope
they're not telling these kids to beat up the old couple that's not
singing along! If they are, we're goners for sure!''
</P>
<P>
   I read a review the next day and learned that Outkast actually
did a tribute to civil rights heroine Rosa Parks at some point
during their performance. I have no idea when that happened, but
I'm glad to know about it. Anyway, I couldn't wait for them to
finish so I could hear Lauryn sing.
</P>
<P>
   She was awesome. It was worth all the stares and all the kids
asking if I had the time. I understood every word she said and I
stood on my feet for the whole concert. For a while, I even forgot
that we were the oldest couple there.
</P>
<P>
   Then it happened. I was in the restroom washing my hands when a
young lady stared at me and said, ``Are you really wearing
pantyhose? Man, I didn't even know they still made those things.''
</P>
<P>
   I went into a stall, removed the hosiery and stuffed them into
my purse, which was probably the largest purse there, too.
</P>
<P>
   When I joined my husband again, he said, ``What happened to your
panty hose? Did you get a run?''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that grand? I guess that's why the poet Robert Browning
said, ``Grow old along with me! The best is yet to be.''
</P>
<P>
   So we were the old guys in the group. That's OK. We had fun, and
I suffered only minimal hearing loss.

TEXAS LOSES INTEGRAL RANCHING FIGURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Montgomery Harrison Wadsworth ``Montie'' Ritchie died last week,
and Texas' ranching heritage was diminished.
</P>
<P>
   The 88-year-old Ritchie wasn't a household name in most of
Texas, but in the Panhandle, he and his family have been an
integral part of the landscape for more than 100 years. He was
owner and operator of the famed JA Ranch, the Palo Duro ranch near
Amarillo established by Charles Goodnight in 1877.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie, like Goodnight, wasn't considered one of the state's
most lovable characters. He was an Englishman, and that set him
apart from the rest of the workaday cowboys. He was a man of some
wealth and that set him apart even more.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ashwell, England, Ritchie was the grandson of JA Ranch
founders John Adair and Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie Adair.
</P>
<P>
   Adair was an English aristocrat of Scots-Irish descent. He made
his first visit to the United States in 1866 when he established a
brokerage in New York City. A year later, he met and married
Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie. In 1874, the couple went on a buffalo
hunt in northern Colorado, and although Adair didn't kill a
buffalo, he did manage to shoot his own horse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he loved the new land and moved his brokerage house to
Denver, where he eventually entered into a business agreement with
Goodnight. Adair put up the money to establish the JA Ranch, and
Goodnight took over the management for one-quarter of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Adairs accompanied Goodnight to the new ranch but didn't
stay. Adair was erudite and considered abundantly arrogant. He
didn't sit well with the ranch cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   He died in 1885, and his wife inherited the ranch. The
relationship with Goodnight ended two years later. Cornelia died in
1921.
</P>
<P>
   James Wadsworth Ritchie, Montie's father, had a shot at running
the ranch, but ran afoul of Goodnight.
</P>
<P>
   James was educated in France and England, and in 1887, he came
to the Palo Duro ranch to learn the ranching business. Goodnight
took him on as a cowhand and trained him, eventually elevating him
to foreman of the ranch's Tule Division.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodnight would not abide gambling on the ranch, and James
was caught wagering. He was quickly demoted. His mother shipped him
off to New York, where he sold JA horses to the New York City
Police Department. He never returned to the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Montie, however, did move to the JA in 1931. He stayed,
directing the ranch's management with his brother, Richard Morgan
Wadsworth ``Dick'' Ritchie, and sister, Gabrielle M. Ritchie
Keiller. Dick Ritchie died in 1941, and Gabrielle became a British
citizen and sold her interest in the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Montie Ritchie took over sole control of the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, he retired as ranch president, turning control
over to his daughter, Ninia Ritchie Bivins. His wife, Hildegard
``Hildy'' Neil, died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie was an avid photographer and art collector. His
collection includes works by Monet, Renoir, Cezanne and Gauguin. He
was a director of the Continental Bank in Fort Worth and an
honorary vice president of the Texas and Southwestern Cattle
Raisers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie played an important part in preserving Texas' ranching
history with several donations to the Ranching Heritage Center in
Lubbock.

 &HT;    Immigrants offer Alabama tax assessor settlement in English-only
suit
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. _ In multiple languages, ``Welcome!'' flies on
blue banners fluttering from light posts. The local chamber of
commerce promotes international trade. Companies from Greece, South
Korea, Japan and Indonesia have offices in town. The local
populations of Hispanic and Asian residents are among the fastest
growing in Alabama, and it's here that the Marshall Space Flight
Center conducts tests for the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   It's also here that Julio and Carmen de Paula chose to retire
and ultimately found themselves involved in a dispute that began
with their difficulty in speaking English.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants from the Dominican Republic, the de Paulas moved from
New York City in 1995 and bought a three-bedroom brick house for
$54,000.
</P>
<P>
   They were welcomed at grocery stores and gas stations. In fact,
they were welcomed everywhere _ except in the office of Madison
County Tax Assessor Wayland Cooley. The 83-year-old official
refused to grant them homestead exemptions because they couldn't
speak English. Without the exemption, the de Paulas pay nearly
triple in property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years ago, the de Paulas and Byong-Rye Ahn, an
immigrant from Seoul, South Korea, filed a civil suit against
Cooley.
</P>
<P>
   Their attorney from the Southern Poverty Law Center in
Montgomery on Tuesday sent an out-of-court settlement offer to
Cooley. Attorney Rhonda Brownstein has asked that Cooley allow
non-English speakers the right to use an interpreter, which he has
prohibited in the past. Under the proposal, Cooley cannot withhold
exemptions merely because a property owner cannot speak English.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the de Paulas would receive nearly $1,500 in taxes they
contend they have overpaid while Ahn would get about $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a language-discrimination case,'' Brownstein said.
``Mr. Cooley's intent is to discriminate against foreign-born
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison County Attorney Julian Butler, who is representing
Cooley, has not returned phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Cooley, a Democrat who's served nearly 22
years, claimed he was trying to prevent fraud by residents who
cannot speak English. He also claimed he was immune from damage
claims because he is a public official.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to let the de Paulas and Ahns use interpreters
because he wasn't sure the interpreters were translating
truthfully, court papers say.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs and their allies say Cooley is an exception in
Huntsville, whose people have welcomed them to the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Mr. Cooley is like the weed in the garden,'' said Rosa
Almanza, a friend who has helped translate for the de Paulas. ``The
city of Huntsville is not the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The de Paulas, who are naturalized citizens, moved to Huntsville
after visiting friends in 1995. Julio de Paula, 71, left his job as
a solderer for Ford Motor Co. His wife, 59, sewed women's underwear
in a Brooklyn factory.
</P>
<P>
   Every dollar mattered since they lived on a fixed income and
were saving for their son to attend college. In 1996, Julio de
Paula applied for a property tax break given to the elderly. The
Spanish-speaking de Paula took his son, Ricardo, to the county tax
assessor's office to translate.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of completing the application, a clerk summoned
Cooley, who told the de Paulas they didn't qualify for the
exemption because they didn't speak English. In interviews and
affidavits, the de Paulas recalled Cooley said an immigration
officer instructed him to revoke all their property tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Through an interpreter, Julio de Paula recalled in an interview
that Cooley told him, ``I make the law here. You don't speak
English, you're not going to get anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Said de Paula: ``When he treated me like that, I felt like
garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case mentioned in court papers, Mary Catherine
Graham, a financial analyst for the FBI, accompanied a Mexican
native who had purchased a home in Madison County last year. With a
real estate agent, Graham tried to show Cooley a copy of an opinion
by Alabama attorney general Bill Pryor that said an amendment to
the state constitution declaring English the state's official
language did not restrict non-English speakers from claiming
homestead exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that he had to watch out for people who were trying to
come in from all over the world and skin us on taxes,'' Graham said
during a February deposition.
</P>
<P>
   According to Graham, Cooley screamed during the office
encounter, ``If you'd had as many ancestors die fighting for this
country, then you'd understand why it makes me so mad when people
come in here from all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   A display of U.S. military service medals sits outside Cooley's
courthouse suite.
</P>
<P>
   The de Paulas and Ahns are part of a growing minority population
of Hispanics and Asians in the South. While Alabama added 6.9
percent more residents (278,765 people) from 1990 to 1997,
according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Hispanic population grew
60 percent (14,675) and the Asian population grew 27 percent
(5,830).
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, Madison County had an estimated 5,038 Hispanics
and an estimated 5,717 Asians _ the most in both categories in
Alabama. In seven years, the county's Hispanic population grew 60
percent, and the Asian population grew 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dramatic increases, residents from those population
categories represent only about four of every 100 people in Madison
County, which has more than 270,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Madison County remained an Old South cotton belt town through
the 1950s. But after World War II, an Alabama legislator invited in
German scientists who brought with them rocket technology that
helped develop a new industry for the area.
</P>
<P>
   The remade economy has boosted the county's per capita income to
one of the state's highest. But the prosperity hadn't reached Ahn
in such proportions that she could afford to pay the $3,000 in new
taxes she said Cooley threatened her with because her English was
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Through an interpreter from a Korean church, Ahn, 64, a
housekeeper at Huntsville Hospital, said Cooley's face turned red
when she visited him in 1997. Her husband died eight years earlier
and she failed to claim the homestead exemption in her name.
Brownstein said the exemptions are good for either spouse but the
death of Mr. Ahn put Cooley in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley exclaimed, ``What?! That's your problem,'' Ahn recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Ahn said she started crying in the office and offered her
housekeeping services to Cooley as partial payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crying is your problem, too,'' Ahn recalled Cooley saying.
``If you don't speak English, why did you move to America?''

   WASHINGTON _ Federal Trade Commissioner Sheila F. Anthony warned
Congress Tuesday that new laws are needed to protect the privacy of
Internet users from companies that employ new technologies to
gather and sell their personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony told a panel of the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee that some companies have made a business
of collecting personal information online and selling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered just how much information these companies can
gather on you when I checked into what one of these `information
brokers' had on me and my husband,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She found that the company had acquired the couple's names,
address, house value, Social Security numbers and the years in
which they were issued, mothers' maiden names, and addresses where
they lived before coming to Washington, D.C. The company also had
collected the names of the couple's two daughters, the names of the
daughters' husbands, all four of their Social Security numbers,
every address they had lived and the name of her 3-year-old
grandchild and the child's Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony did not name the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say the least, I was shocked and more than a little
disturbed by a company being able to gather that kind of
information on me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``information brokers'' are able to cobble together complete
profiles on individuals by buying bits and pieces of personal
information from many different companies and compiling them into
one databank.
</P>
<P>
   Since many Web sites that sell products also ask customers to
fill out forms that include name, address, Social Security number,
credit card number and other personal information, privacy experts
fear that some or all of that information could be sold to
information brokers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the computer accessing a Web site leaves an
electronic signature that can identify the incoming computer and
record what the computer user does while at the Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony said that she favors legislation that would require each
Web site to inform visitors of what information is being collected
on them and how it will be used.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., who has proposed such legislation,
said firms should not be able to sell people's personal information
without their permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to know what's being done with their information
so they can know who to trust and who not to trust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the views of Anthony and Burns were not shared by three
other FTC commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I think more needs to be done, I believe the Internet
industry has done a good job at self-regulation,'' Robert Pitofsky,
FTC chairman, told the senators.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to a recent survey by Georgetown University that
found that almost two-thirds of the World Wide Web's busiest sites
post their policies regarding use of the personal data.
</P>
<P>
   A similar survey last year by the FTC, which enforces federal
competition and anti-fraud laws, found that less than 10 percent of
sites disclosed how personal information was gathered and used.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC survey also reported that more than nine out of 10 of
the Web's top 100 sites, which account for around 90 percent of
traffic on the Internet, have some privacy statements;
three-quarters of those give computer users some choice about how
their information is used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online firms deserve considerable credit for making progress
over the last year,'' Pitofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   But Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a Washington-based advocacy group, told the
panel that the Georgetown survey also showed that only 10 percent
of sites met standards agreed on by the FTC and the Internet
industry for giving consumers adequate privacy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Those standards include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Telling computer users how information is collected;
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving them a choice on how it is used;
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving people access to their files;
</P>
<P>
   _ Describing the company's security system;
</P>
<P>
   _ Providing a contact person.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg said the incomplete nature of the privacy disclosures
cited in the survey is evidence that legislation is needed to
guarantee that Web sites use information appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the time for self-regulation is running out,'' he
said.
</P>

   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burns' bill joins more than a dozen others introduced this
session that contain some provision for protecting personal
information that is transmitted electronically.
</P>
<P>
   The measures address online privacy, policies requiring
businesses to post privacy notices, privacy of medical records,
privacy of encrypted messages and privacy of Social Security
numbers.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Michael Zinner, whose day job is running the
surgery department at Harvard Medical School, stood in the kitchen
of Le Bernardin dressed in chef's whites instead of surgeon's
greens and tried to get used to the fact that 22-year-olds thought
it was perfectly all right to yell at him. For cutting the
mushrooms wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the feeling I had when I was an intern and couldn't draw
blood right,'' said Zinner, 54, the surgeon in chief at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston. ``I didn't know exactly what I was
supposed to do because I hadn't had enough experience.''
</P>
<P>
   For someone who confessed to a ``romantic notion of having a
restaurant,'' working in one for six 12-hour days without pay
turned out to be a lot harder, and more humbling, than he had ever
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Zinner is among a small group of chef wannabes turning up in the
world's most celestial kitchens. Some, like him, are signing up for
a new program and paying thousands of dollars for the privilege.
Others just talk their way into working long, hot days as a galley
slave in a stress-filled and windowless kitchen in return for the
chance to absorb the knowledge and mysterious skills of a star
chef, and maybe even bask in reflected glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think these guys are some kind of deity,'' said Wayne
Kimbell, a New York stockbroker who has also worked with Eric
Ripert, the executive chef at Le Bernardin. ``My friends think it's
pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have worked free in top kitchens are a
disaffected Japanese housewife, a bored Microsoft executive, a
retired Wall Street broker and a dentist. Some are contemplating
midlife career changes. Others simply want to impress their dinner
guests. All are willing indentured servants pursuing culinary
excellence. Or something. After all, they can quit anytime their
feet hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the George Plimpton complex,'' said Christine Patton, the
retired broker. ``You like to have another life for a week and then
go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other amateurs in the kitchen, Zinner never went to
cooking school. ``To me, like many guys my age, grilling was
indistinguishable from cooking,'' he said. He did not have to beg,
plead and wield connections to get through the swinging doors at Le
Bernardin. He paid $2,450 to L'Ecole des Chefs when the program
expanded to the United States from Paris this year.
</P>
<P>
   Participants spend five and a half or six days in one of the
country's best-known kitchens, like Jean Georges, Daniel, Payard
Patisserie and Bistro in New York, Citronelle in Washington or Le
Bec-Fin in Philadelphia. Along with all the abuse they can take,
they get two staff meals a day and one half-price dinner in the
dining room, wine not included.
</P>
<P>
   During lunch service, when Zinner was told to assist the chef de
cuisine on the line, he looked worried. ``He's suffering,'' Ripert
said with a sympathetic laugh. ``He looks tense.'' And he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to screw anything up, but it's still too new to
do it quickly,'' the surgeon said during a lull. He filled a little
notebook with tips and recipes and stayed an extra day because a
Saudi prince canceled surgery. ``Seeing it makes all the difference
in the world, because you couldn't get it just out of reading a
book,'' Zinner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he realized he was here to work, it actually was a
help,'' said Andrea Glick, a line cook and chef's assistant. ``I
would spend 10 minutes showing him something that would take me
half an hour to do. During service, it would be a little hairy, but
he's a very smart man, and he knew how to step out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Patton, who quickly tired of the lady of leisure role
after retiring from Wall Street, an interest in food became an
obsession, however short lived. ``Whenever I'm bored, I learn
something,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She spent six months at the French Culinary Institute in
Manhattan and was an apt enough student to be hired as an
instructor. But she still was not satisfied and sought the
validation of a restaurant kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two days at Daniel, I never went back to the French
Culinary Institute,'' she said. In the kitchen she had discovered
the adrenaline rush she missed from the trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Patton, in her mid-50s, has a new calling: golf. ``I
am a golf fanatic, going to golf school four days a week,'' she
said. ``Think how much healthier it is out on a golf course,
instead of in windowless rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Satomi Inoue prefers a windowless kitchen to sitting at home in
front of a television. She is in the United States with her
husband, a Japanese businessman, and her visa does not permit her
to earn money.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is a traditional Japanese man,'' she said. ``He is
happy if I stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Inoue, 31, is not a traditional wife. Though she makes
her husband's lunch before she leaves for work and has his dinner
on the table when he gets home, she also works full time at Payard.
Without pay.
</P>
<P>
   After spending two years in France, she became interested in
food and put in three months at Peter Kump's Cooking School, then
did a six-week internship at Payard, where she combined cooking
with perfecting her French and English. She has been working in the
bistro almost a year. When she returns from vacation in September,
she will go back to the pastry kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not for my husband,'' she said. ``This is for my
future. I want to teach or translate or write cookbooks when I go
back to Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bert Goldfinger, 47, a New York dentist, is equally serious
about life after inlays. He began cooking as a young boy, earned a
living as a camp cook and took a day job as a dentist but never
gave up his first love. He graduated from the French Culinary
Institute _ first in his class, he is proud to say _ and spent nine
months at Aureole in the pastry department, devoting as much time
as he could spare from his practice. Unpaid, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Now each week, he spends two evenings and all day Saturday in
the pastry kitchen at Le Cirque 2000, still unpaid. ``Somewhere
down the line, my wife and I are going to open a small restaurant
near Hudson, N.Y,'' he said, as he helped to box candies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I do during the day is noble, but people don't look
forward to it,'' he said. ``When I cook a meal, people look forward
to it. Dentistry is much like pastry. It's artistic, creative and
very scientific. But dentistry is physical, very exacting,
stressful, emotionally draining, and this is relaxing, compared to
that. This is much more fun than dentistry, I can assure you.''
</P>
<P>
   No one will argue.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Myhrvold, who became a millionaire many times over as
chief technology officer of Microsoft, has never had a desire to
open a restaurant, but he can reel off the names of his good
friends who are chefs: Gray Kuntz, Christian Delouvrier, Daniel
Boulud, David Bouley.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold is a self-taught cook who was responsible for
Thanksgiving dinner from age 9, but La Varenne in Paris would not
accept him until he had done a short apprenticeship, so he started
working at Rover's, a restaurant in Seattle. A couple of months
grew into a two-year commitment. He worked one day a week from noon
to 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``In small doses, it was interesting and invigorating,'' he
said. ``I've raced Formula One cars, sky diving, bungee jumping.
There's an intensity in cooking that does match that _ well, maybe
not sky diving _ and doing it well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Myhrvold, who has left Microsoft to pursue his first love,
scientific research, rates himself as just OK as a chef.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is better off with me patronizing great restaurants
than trying to cook in them,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   A similar survey last year by the FTC, which enforces federal
competition and anti-fraud laws, found that less than 10 percent of
sites disclosed how personal information was gathered and used.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC survey also reported that more than nine out of 10 of
the Web's top 100 sites, which account for around 90 percent of
traffic on the Internet, have some privacy statements;
three-quarters of those give computer users some choice about how
their information is used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online firms deserve considerable credit for making progress
over the last year,'' Pitofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   But Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a Washington-based advocacy group, told the
panel that the Georgetown survey also showed that only 10 percent
of sites met standards agreed on by the FTC and the Internet
industry for giving consumers adequate privacy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Those standards include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Telling computer users how information is collected;
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving them a choice on how it is used;
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving people access to their files;
</P>
<P>
   _ Describing the company's security system;
</P>
<P>
   _ Providing a contact person.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg said the incomplete nature of the privacy disclosures
cited in the survey is evidence that legislation is needed to
guarantee that Web sites use information appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the time for self-regulation is running out,'' he
said.

TOO MUCH OF A BAD THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel law died a richly deserved
death four weeks ago with the approval of President Clinton's
nemesis Kenneth Starr, who has conceded that he is winding down his
own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Only the pending August trial of former Associate Attorney
General Webster Hubbell remains on Starr's public agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But the nasty consequences of the law are still with us in the
continuing independent counsel probes of two present and two former
Clinton Cabinet officers.
</P>
<P>
   After a five-year probe that cost taxpayers more than $19
million, former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was acquitted last
year of charges that he received gifts from companies regulated by
his department. Appeals of lower court decisions by peripheral
figures, however, keep the case alive, and Independent Counsel
Donald Smaltz has yet to release his final report.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman is being investigated for possible
influence-peddling and soliciting illegal campaign contributions.
Independent Counsel Ralph Lancaster Jr. began his probe little more
than a year ago, and thus far it has cost the taxpayers only
$264,000, a relative bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt is being probed for possibly
lying to Congress about political favoritism in the rejection of a
casino proposal from three Indian tribes. This too has been in the
works only since last year, but Independent Counsel Carol Bruce has
run up a cost of $1.4 million. Neither Herman nor Babbitt has been
indicted, and both remain in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the most outrageous example of overreaching on the part of
investigators spending public funds and exercising unchecked power
is the unhappy saga of former Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Henry Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1995 Attorney General Janet Reno concluded that
evidence Cisneros had lied to the FBI about support payments to a
former lover justified the appointment of an independent counsel to
look into criminal charges. Four and a half years and $7 million
taxpayer dollars later, Cisneros is scheduled to come to trial in
September on 18 felony counts of conspiracy, obstructing justice
and making false statements to the federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Independent counsel David Barrett accuses Cisneros of concealing
the amount and frequency of payments he made to the former
mistress, Linda Jones, in order to win confirmation to the Cabinet
post. The affair itself was already public knowledge and he had
reconciled with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros left the Cabinet voluntarily at the end of Clinton's
first term still enjoying the president's support, at least in
public. Cisneros is now president of Univision, a Spanish-language
television network based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The case has mostly rumbled along out of the public eye. But on
Monday a federal judge ruled that the jury in Cisneros' pending
trial could hear 26 of 88 disputed tapes secretly recorded by Jones
of their conversations during the 1990-1993 period when he was
making payments to her. She has admitted to editing some of the
tapes to eliminate segments unflattering to her.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers fought admission of the tapes. If convicted
on all counts, Cisneros, who has pleaded innocent, faces 90 years
in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   But whether he is guilty or innocent, things should never have
come to this. Nor should the probe have taken so long. Cisneros has
already paid a psychological and financial penalty far out of
proportion to the alleged wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to cover up the consequences of infidelity is not
behavior to be condoned in presidents, Cabinet members or anyone
else. But neither is it a crime deserving of the full legal wrath
of the federal government and the threat of a lifetime jail
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett claims Cisneros lied about the payments to Jones because
they were hush money to buy her silence and protect his HUD
nomination. If that is so, Cisneros foolishly laid his neck on the
line for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the leaders of the Senate Banking Committee, which
passed on Cisneros' Cabinet nomination, were not inclined to view
the real scope and frequency of his payments as fatal to his
political career. Both former Sen. Donald Riegle Jr., a Democrat
who was then committee chairman, and former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a
Republican who was then ranking minority member, have said that had
they known the truth, they would have approved Cisneros for the
post anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There is about the Cisneros case, as about the impeachment trial
of President Clinton, a sense of official vindictiveness that goes
beyond earnest enforcement of the law. It's not just Starr that's
guilty. Repeatedly, other independent counsels have demonstrated
that their absolute power drives them to dangerous extremes to
punish their targets and prove their own self-righteous
superiority.
</P>
<P>
   Do Americans really think justice demands that Cisneros go to
the pokey if he lied to the FBI? He sold no state secrets. He
pocketed no federal funds. He cheated no one except his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Where no big name and no big federal money is involved,
prosecutors don't waste their time on such minor infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Starr wanted to make an example of Clinton because, he said,
even a ``little white lie'' is illegal. However technically true
that may be, it defies common sense and human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett seems similarly bent on twisting an apparent lapse of
ethics into a legal monstrosity. We hope Cisneros' trial is brief
and fair and the jury is more realistic about what's appropriate
than his pursuers have been.

SENATORS' DISTASTE FOR CLINTON AND U.N. SANDBAGS HOLBROOKE
NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Neb., Okla., N.C., Va.)   (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's decision to
take a ``second look'' at the nomination of Richard Holbrooke to be
the chief U.S. diplomat to the United Nations appears to have less
to do with Holbrooke's qualifications than with the Senate's low
esteem for both the United Nations and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination has been in limbo for well over a year, stalled
initially by ethical questions about Holbrooke's business dealings
as an investment banker. But now Lott and other senators are
holding the nomination hostage in exchange for various demands on
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate that has developed reflects the anger and distrust
between the Republican-controlled Congress and President Clinton
the year after his impeachment. It also underscores the
unpopularity of the United Nations, both in Congress and among the
public, and the fact that there is little price to pay for turning
down an official whom many senators consider arrogant and whose
job, unlike that of secretary of state, is largely unknown to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Lott ordered his aides last week to conduct yet another review,
even though the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved
Holbrook in June without dissent after four exhaustive hearings.
But the ``second look'' at Holbrooke by the senator's staff, Senate
Republican aides said, had less to do with the nominee's fitness
for the job than with saving face for Republicans who are stalling
a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Lott had placed a ``hold'' on the nomination, in a show
of loyalty to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has sought the
appointment of a conservative to the Federal Election Commission
whom the White House and many congressional Democrats oppose. The
Republicans were attempting an old-fashioned horse trade: Holbrooke
would be confirmed if Bradley Smith, an Ohio law professor, was
appointed to the FEC by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only leverage we have with the administration is the power
to confirm,'' McConnell said in an interview. He said the White
House was trying to usurp a long tradition that permitted
Republicans and Democrats to each pick members of the commission.
But he said that discussions continue with the White House to break
the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Such a prolonged delay of a Cabinet-level appointee is rare,
particularly when the reasons are largely unrelated to the nominee
himself. The Senate's historian, Richard Baker, said in an
interview that he could not recall a case like Holbrooke's in the
past quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unprecedented in the way they've beaten this around,''
said G. Calvin Mackenzie, a professor of government at Colby
College. ``The appointment process has become an opportunity for a
Senate controlled by one party to get leverage on a president of
another party.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lott and McConnell, two other senators also have
holds on the nomination. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, wants to
protect a woman he thinks was a whistle-blower at the U.S. mission
at the United Nations. And Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, is wary
of Holbrooke's role in the administration's Balkan policymaking.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet appointees have, of course, been defeated. The Senate
rejected President George Bush's nomination of former Sen. John
Tower, R-Texas, to be defense secretary in 1989. Since 1801,
however, only 18 Cabinet-level nominations have been rejected or
not confirmed for other reasons, according to the Senate Historical
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Even Lott says Holbrooke will be confirmed eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate rules, any lawmaker can delay a final vote on
legislation or a nomination indefinitely, usually to force an
administration to accept something, or someone, it would not
otherwise approve. But Senators typically exercise this prerogative
on middle-level appointments, like ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Senate tradition of holding presidential
nominations hostage for other ends, but what's unique is this one
is at the level of the U.N. ambassador,'' said Marshall Wittmann,
director of congressional relations for the conservative Heritage
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Cabinet-level nominees are created equal. When Sen.
James Inhofe, R-Okla., threatened in June to block all presidential
nominations, including that of Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers to be Treasury secretary, the world financial markets
briefly quaked. Senate leaders and Clinton quickly worked out a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In this Senate, Washington's envoy to the United Nations does
not command that respect, many scholars said. The Cabinet-level
status for the U.S. delegate to the United Nations has been
conferred by Clinton, but it is not automatic, as with other
Cabinet posts. The United States has been without a permanent
representative to the United Nations since last September, when
Bill Richardson left the position to become secretary of energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blocking the nominee to the U.N. is a good way for Senate
Republicans to frustrate the Clinton administration without drawing
a great backlash,'' said John Pitney, a political science professor
at Claremont McKenna College. ``Plus, a vast number of Americans
have no idea who Richard Holbrooke is.''
</P>
<P>
   His nomination was held up most of the last year as a result of
federal ethics investigations that ended without any criminal
charges. The Foreign Relations Committee approved Holbrooke only
after the administration agreed to endorse reductions in the U.S.
assessments to the United Nations, championed by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., the committee's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the panel's approval, however, the four Senate
Republicans moved to block a final vote by the full Senate. Lott's
commitment to his cause came under scrutiny two weeks ago when Tim
Russert, the host of NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' asked the senator
about Smith. Looking surprised, Lott replied, ``Bradley Smith? Now,
let's see. That sounds familiar. Who is Bradley Smith?''
</P>
<P>
   Only after a little coaching from Russert did Lott recall the
connection. The senator's spokesman, John Czwartacki, who refused
to confirm that Lott had put a hold on the nomination, dismissed
the exchange over Smith and the review of Holbrooke's record as ``a
tempest in a teapot.''
</P>
<P>
   The delays have angered Senate Democrats, and now even some
influential Republicans are growing weary of the stalling. Sen.
John Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed Services Committee, and
Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., a member of the Foreign Relations
Committee, have demanded a quick vote on Holbrooke to fill an
important U.S. foreign policy job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holbrooke issue is a clear example of how bipartisan
foreign policy and national security have frayed to the point where
no cloth is left,'' Hagel said in an interview. ``This kind of
conspiratorial, back room nonsense is holding Holbrooke hostage.
America's interests in the world are being held captive by a small
partisan band.''

ENTREPRENEURS FINDING IT HARD TO GET FUNDS, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER KAMINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the United States, by far the world's most
entrepreneurial nation, has an annual $60 billion available in
private equity for new start-up businesses, entrepreneurs have a
tough time getting to it, a study on US entrepreneurship concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 1999 National Assessment, a
joint study by Babson College and the Kauffman Center for
Entrepreneurial Leadership, is scheduled for release at a meeting
of the Congressional Economic Leadership Institute in Washington
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Each year Americans create approximately 600,000 to 800,000 new
businesses with employees, a birthrate of 14 to 16 start-ups of
every exisiting company, according to the report. About another two
million self-employment ventures are formed without employees.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, ``As many as 8.4 out of every 100 US
adults _ 16 million Americans in all _ are currently trying to
start a business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong entrepreneurial culture in the United
States,'' said Andrew Zacharakis, entreprenuership assistant
professor at Babson College and the lead Global Entrepreneurship
Monitor researcher. ``You're not a failure if you tried and did not
succeed. You're a failure if you have never tried.''
</P>
<P>
   The report states that it is more difficult to obtain equity
seed than debt capital. Of the available $60 billion, which may
account for 71 percent of the world's available capital, $56
billion comes from family and friends, and only $4 billion comes
from venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   The research was conducted during the last two years to analyze
the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic growth in
the United States and nine other countries, including the other G7
nations and Denmark, Finland, and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of entrepreneurship experts, who were interviewed
for the study, said that entrepreneurs don't even know about the
many federal, state, and local government assistance programs that
are available because of poor marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2 to 3 percent of small businesses receive government
assistance from the Small Business Administration loan guarantee
program, most of which are not even start-ups, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the entrepreneurs out there to get the available
equity so they will start creating new jobs,'' Zacharakis said.
``The idea is to help entrepreneurship in these countries and
develop policies that would either help or hinder entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   To encourage more US entrepreneural activity, the study
sugggests an increase in entrepreneural education, more simple
government tax regulations, a clearinghouse to detail government
programs, and greater federal analysis.

NORTH KOREA WARNED AGAINST TESTING MISSILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and her
counterparts from South Korea and Japan appealed to the isolated
Communist government of North Korea on Tuesday to accept engagement
with the world rather than to risk ``serious negative
consequences'' with a long-range missile test.
</P>
<P>
   The warning, in a joint statement here, is part of a full-blown
diplomatic effort to keep North Korea from going ahead with the
anticipated test. It was the latest in a series of admonitions from
American officials, including Secretary of Defense William S.
Cohen, who is visiting Japan and South Korea this week in a
specific effort to discourage North Korea from going ahead with the
test.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of another such test by North Korea, after a
surprise test last August, has dominated the annual meeting of the
Association of South East Asian Nations here.
</P>
<P>
   It has added to the sense that security concerns have replaced
economic matters as the top focus of the region. As the countries
that were battered by financial crisis two years ago begin to
recover, attention has turned to new tensions between China and
Taiwan and to the threat of North Korea's missile and nuclear
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The prime concern of the United States is that another test by
North Korea could set off a chain of potentially destabilizing
actions around the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence data has pointed to steady preparations by
North Korea for a second launch. The missile that the regime
apparently intends to test is a Taepodong-2, which has an estimated
range of up to 3,750 miles, making it capable theoretically of
reaching Alaska or Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The new rocket is described by officials as an advanced version
of the Taepodong-1, which North Korea fired over Japan and into the
Pacific Ocean in August.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese foreign minister, Masahiko Koumura, said at a news
conference here Tuesday that if North Korea went ahead with its
test, the Japanese government probably would withdraw the $1
billion it recently allocated for the Korean Energy Development
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should there be another test launch by North Korea, in view of
the Japanese people's sentiment, it will be extremely difficult for
Japan to continue its cooperation'' with the development
organization, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This development consortium, which is also backed by the United
States, has agreed to build two light water reactors in North Korea
in return for the regime ending its nuclear program. The United
States gives North Korea 500,000 tons of fuel oil a year as part of
an effort to create an alternative to nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
   But a break-up of the consortium could induce North Korea to
resume construction of nuclear reactors that produce plutonium for
nuclear weapons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is also worried that another launch
by North Korea would encourage South Korea to move ahead with
several missile projects of its own, further fueling an arms race
on the Korean Peninsula. South Korea recently proposed building a
generation of medium-range missiles that could strike much of North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean foreign minister, Hong Soon-Young, addressed
this concern Tuesday, saying that, ``The whole purpose of missile
development on the part of South Korea is to reinforce the
deterrence against North Korean act of adventurism.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong added that his government was ready to abide by the
``spirit'' of the Missile Technology Control Regime, an
international agreement that obligates signers to restrict the
range of their missiles.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The test last year, which the North Koreans insisted was for a
satellite launch, set off such concern in Japan that the government
decided to make an initial investment in the U.S. theater missile
defense program. Another launch by North Korea would almost
certainly increase Japan's interest in the proposed system _ thus
irritating China, which views Japanese participation in missile
defense as aimed at the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
   In their three-way appearance this morning, Ms. Albright and the
two foreign ministers tried, without being very specific, to stress
the positive incentives for North Korea not to test.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albright said the policy of the South Korean president, Kim
Dae Jung for engagement with North Korea, its longtime enemy, and a
program to be announced by former defense secretary, William J.
Perry, President Clinton's special envoy for North Korean affairs,
give North Korea a ``good chance to strengthen its economic and
political ties with the world.``
</P>
<P>
   Perry said last month that a second test by North Korea would
jeopardize a gradual effort by the administration to normalize
relations with that nation and to lift economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Perry visited North Korea in May to present his comprehensive
package for improving relations. While officials said he was
received politely, the regime told him it retained its right to
test a second missile. Several weeks after Perry left, North Korea
provoked a naval clash with South Korea in disputed waters in the
Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is under pressure from Congress on
its policy toward North Korea, in part because the United States is
sending the oil and also food aid to North Korea, which has
suffered from drought in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials have acknowledged in recent weeks
that they are in a quandary over how to deal with North Korea. So
far, the food and fuel have not curbed the missile development or
the export of missile technology to countries such as Iran, Syria
and Pakistan, they said.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that, although the closed nature of the regime
makes it hard to know its intentions, it was possible that the
signs of preparation for a missile launch were being made as a
tactic to win more favors from the United States and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan D. Pollack, a senior adviser at the Rand Corp., said
that the efforts of the administration to forge a stern common
policy with South Korea and Japan may not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North Koreans may believe they can dodge the bullet one
more time,'' he said. ``In the past, every time they have done
something to defy the United States or South Korea _ including last
year's test _ we tried to funnel more money to them.''

 &HT;    Keeping cool tricky in heat-saturated South
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Here's a trick to beat the heat: Roll in the mud
and use your ears as an air-conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the elephants were keeping cool Tuesday at Riddle's
Elephant Breeding Farm and Wildlife Sanctuary in central Arkansas.
They roll in the mud to keep the bugs off and prevent sunburn, but
their secret weapon is their ears.
</P>
<P>
   ''The elephants cool off by slapping their ears,'' said Heidi
Riddle, who, with her husband Scott, runs a sort of retirement home
for elephants. ''It doesn't create a breeze, but the skin on the
inside of their ears is very thin, and there is a large network of
blood vessels there. Flapping their ears pumps cooled blood through
the body. It's like a giant air conditioner.''
</P>
<P>
   The South could use a giant air-conditioner. Although the heat
wave has been more dangerous in the Midwest and the Northeast,
where 31 people have died, two people have died in North Carolina
because of the heat. No relief is in sight for the next several
days, forecasters say.
</P>
<P>
   And temperatures around the South have been plenty
uncomfortable. It has been in the 90s from the beaches of North
Carolina to the Mississippi Delta. Temperatures have hovered around
100 degrees in Little Rock since last week, and it was 102 degrees
Tuesday at the Riddles' place in Greenbrier, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't roll around in the mud, but maybe we should,'' Riddle
said. ''We just drink lots of water. And I try not to look at the
thermometer after it goes above 90.''
</P>
<P>
   You can tell Southerners it was hotter and drier last summer,
and you can tell them it's always steamy in July, but it just
doesn't make it feel any cooler when a heat wave rolls in.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, temperatures rose to the mid-90s across much of the
state, leaving tourists and residents sweating but not complaining
of any unusual heat. Many recalled June 1998 when the mercury
soared above 100 degrees and the Sunshine State was scorched by a
record-setting drought and dangerous wild fires.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not unseasonably warm,'' said Robb Chase, 35, a bartender
at Key West Taco in Cocoa Beach, an open-air establishment where
patrons swigged cold beer as they sweated under ceiling fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's July,'' said Hank Meinhart, who owns a local bar. ''It's
supposed to be hot.''
</P>
<P>
   But tourists Donald and Cathy Ferguson found the heat stifling.
Mrs. Ferguson glowed a bright red after only an hour on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hotter than hell,'' said David Ferguson, who recently
moved from Florida to the North Carolina mountains near Asheville.
''It never used to be this hot in the summer. The weather has gone
crazy. And we must be crazy coming in a taco place and eating hot
food.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flat, treeless expanse of the Mississippi Delta,
non-irrigated farms are suffering from too little rain in recent
weeks. Soybeans planted for early harvest may not make it if the
rain doesn't come soon, farmers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It rains here for a little while and it doesn't rain over
there,'' said Bill Pearson, a retired farmer from Sumner. He farms
250 acres of soybeans ''as a hobby'' and he says they are starting
to wilt.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not as bad as last year, he added, when it was hotter
and it didn't rain at all. Crops and livestock across the Southeast
were devastated last summer by record temperatures and a relentless
drought.
</P>
<P>
   But still, Pearson, 77, finds it too uncomfortable to go
outside.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm reading a lot,'' he said. ''I wonder what we did before
air conditioning? I was just a boy then and I don't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   On Avery Island off the coast of Louisiana, Paul McIlhenny,
president of Tabasco Brand Products, says the peppers used in his
hot sauce are thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hotter than the hinges of Hades on the island but the
peppers love it,'' he said. McIlhenny doesn't love it quite as much
as his peppers do, but he fights fire with fire by dousing all his
meals with Tabasco.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we fry our eggs on the sidewalk here, we always add a
couple of drops of Tabasco,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So why do people in hot climates eat spicy foods, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm told it makes you sweat more, and perspiration makes you
feel cooler,'' McIlhenny said.

ABC ASSURES MINORITIES FALL PROGRAMMING TO REFLECT DIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ As a national coalition of Hispanic civil
rights groups Tuesday joined the chorus of demands for more
diversity on television, top executives at ABC became the latest
network honchos to pledge that Latino and black characters will be
added to new programs this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we have an obligation to reflect society as it is,''
said Stu Bloomberg, cochairman of the ABC Entertainment Television
Group. ``This is a very serious situation to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of the NAACP, which two weeks ago blasted the
networks for a ``virtual whitewash'' of minority characters, the
Hispanic coalition demanded an end to the ``brownout'' of Latino
characters on TV. The coalition _ consisting of La Raza, a Hispanic
advocacy group; the National Hispanic Media Coalition; and the
National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts _ noted that although 11
percent of the US population is Hispanic, only 2 percent of
television characters are.
</P>
<P>
   In response, NBC released a statement calling diversity a ``top
priority'' and pointing to minority characters on such shows as
``ER'' while acknowledging ``there is still work to be done.'' In
the past week, executives at CBS, Fox, and the WB network have also
told writers gathered here for the semiannual meeting of the
Television Critics Association that they are concerned about the
lack of diversity in their shows and are moving to add minority
characters, including Hispanics, to new and existing programs.
</P>
<P>
   However, none of the network executives has been able to fully
explain why minority characters were not added earlier in the
program-development process, and why the last-minute additions
should not be seen as tokenism designed to defuse controversy. As
with the other networks, ABC's walls of enlarged photos displaying
the casts of new shows were strikingly devoid of nonwhite faces.
</P>
<P>
   The networks' defensive scramble to recast some shows was
prompted by a blistering criticism delivered two weeks ago by the
NAACP. The nation's oldest civil rights organization denounced the
virtual absence of minority characters on 26 new prime-time
programs, threatened a boycott and lawsuit, and called for hearings
by Congress and the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Fili-Krushel, president of the ABC Television Network,
Tuesday made a ``personal commitment'' to improve diversity at ABC
_ although she said the network's soap operas had been well
integrated _ and said she will meet soon with NAACP president
Kweisi Mfume. ``At a certain point, I know, talk becomes cheap,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   On another issue, the ABC executives sought Tuesday to dispel a
widespread belief in the TV industry that ABC's doors are now
closed to new programs from any studio not wearing the mouse ears
of the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg and ABC Entertainment president Jamie Tarses insisted
that the network will not morph into a channel offering all Disney,
all the time, despite the recent merger of Disney's TV production
unit and the entertainment division of ABC, which Disney owns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we can have a schedule that is comprised of
100 percent Disney product,'' insisted Bloomberg. ``We would be
crazy not get the best product we can from Fox or Warner Bros. or
any other studio.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Lloyd Braun, Bloomberg's counterpart as cochairman of
the ABC Entertainment Television Group, acknowledged that under the
new consolidation, ``more of our (program) development will be
targeted to ABC. That's why we're doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger is an effort by the Disney Co. to cut costs and gain
ownership of more of the programs aired on ABC. But the
consolidation of ABC Entertainment and the Walt Disney Television
Studio caused a stir because it changed the studio's role as an
independent production unit that was free to supply programs to
other networks. (For instance, the studio produces ``Felicity'' for
the WB network.) Concerns arose that the new merged unit, ABC
Entertainment Television Group, would no longer produce programs
for other networks; there are concerns as well that ABC will no
longer consider programs from other production studios.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, CBS Television president Leslie Moonves
suggested that ABC was now a closed shop, creatively speaking. ``If
any network expects to get a show from that company, they're out of
their minds,'' he said. ``Clearly, this a decision on (Disney CEO)
Michael Eisner's part. God forbid it should have delivered a hit to
CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Braun said that some programs developed by the new unit
inevitably ``won't be right'' for ABC and could be offered ``to
NBC, the WB, or even CBS.''

GOOD REASON TO HOLD ON TO THAT EARLY STEPHEN KING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Mass.)   (af)  
 Christa Worthington writes about arts, antiques and design.  
 By CHRISTA WORTHINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Browsing at a book fair one day, Chris Offutt, the author of
``Out of the Woods,'' a collection of short stories, discovered the
value of his library of contemporary fiction. ``I'd pick something
up and it was marked $100,'' he recalled. ``And I said, `Hey, I
have that, only my copy is signed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now he treats his books with a new respect. ``I figure they can
help put my kids through college. Writing won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '90s, prices for first editions of modern
literary works have hit the stratosphere: $35,000 for a signed copy
of Jack Kerouac's ``On the Road''; $250,000 for a copy of
``Ulysses'' signed by James Joyce for Ezra Pound, and $15,000 for
Harper Lee's ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
</P>
<P>
   The gold rush in such literary ``high points'' _ the industry
term for well-known titles by name authors _ has also fostered
speculation in recently published books: first editions printed
within the last five years that are still in pristine condition and
preferably signed by the author. The challenge of so-called
hypermodern collecting is to spot future best sellers while they
are still in small first-print runs and in stores.
</P>
<P>
   If, for instance, you had bought a first edition of ``Angela's
Ashes,'' Frank McCourt's 1996 memoir of growing up poor in Ireland,
you would own a book that sells on the Internet for $500. The Civil
War novel ``Cold Mountain,'' by Charles Frazier, has a similar
asking price.
</P>
<P>
   Both books became blockbusters after small first print runs. If
the major motion picture of the book is a hit, the first edition
will be worth much more. If not, the book's trading price could
suffer, as happened in the case of Tom Wolfe's ``Bonfire of the
Vanities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Speculation is a '90s thing,'' said Francis Wahlgren of
Christie's, where books published as recently as the 1980s have
generated interest, including sought-after first editions by
Stephen King and Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it has to do with the film influence,'' Wahlgren
added. ``It's created a market for certain authors.'' He said
``Merchant Ivory type films'' had had an impact on books by Thomas
Hardy and Jane Austen. A copy of ``Pride and Prejudice,'' he said,
would go for a ``very strong price.''
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated hypermodernists don't read the books they intend to
collect. They read reading copies. They keep books for their
collections bound in Mylar covers, turning the spines inward away
from sunlight. Preserving the books in mint condition is often what
makes them rare.
</P>
<P>
   An author's signature increases the value greatly, especially
that of writers who avoid book signings like Don DeLillo, John
Irving and Cormac McCarthy. Dust jackets are essential, without
which the value of any book published after 1920 drops
precipitously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hypermodern collecting has been around in some form forever,''
said David Brown, the publisher of Bookline, a newsletter published
in San Rafael, Calif., that offers tips on the investment value of
books. ``The phenomenon of having these books jump in price quickly
is what's new.''
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary books start at about $35 a copy and some postwar
books can go up to $2,000. Mysteries, the genre that started the
trend, see the biggest jump in price early on; literary fiction is
slower to rise in value but worth more in the long run. Hypermodern
collectors also seek out science fiction and Western regional
fiction, along with memoirs and literary nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   With the growth of the hypermodern phenomenon, bookselling has
become more like the art and stock markets. Today's buyers often
come from Wall Street and the entertainment industry, and many are
interested in the same 50 or so big-money titles _ the books that
were most likely on the baby boomers' high school reading lists.
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders say that William H. Gates, chairman of the
Microsoft Corp., is a collector of the books of J.D. Salinger and
F. Scott Fitzgerald and is thought to have been behind some of the
big-ticket auction sales in which the buyers are not always
identified publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collecting is less esoteric and quirky than it used to be,''
said Ken Lopez, who sells postwar fiction in Hadley, Mass. ``A lot
of the people who are collecting now have started fairly recently.
They'll collect the Pulitzer Prize winners or National Book Award
winners, or extremely notable high spots that are no-brainers.
Everybody wants a `Catcher in the Rye' or a `Catch-22.' It's a
little more like collecting trophies.''
</P>
<P>
   How did modern books come to seem so rare? The change is partly
because of a 1978 tax law that made it difficult for publishers to
keep books in stock for more than a year, making first editions
harder to find. A first edition with a remainder stamp is less
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Though hypermodernism can be seen as a pop phenomenon, it
reflects an American tradition of book collecting in which popular
taste, not the judgments of experts, directs the market. (European
booksellers are mystified by this trend and don't take modern
fiction as seriously.)
</P>
<P>
   Trading on the Web and at book fairs has further eroded dealers'
authority. But even if collecting is more profit-driven, the
literary value of books is not lost on today's collectors. As
Wahlgren put it: ``Good authors sell. That's the one truth that's
been proven with time.''

CHINA AND U.S. PLAN HIGHER-LEVEL TRADE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China and the United States held trade talks here
Tuesday and agreed to higher-level discussions later this year, a
new sign of slowly thawing relations. But they remained frozen on
the most important issue _ China's proposed entry to the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   David Aaron, the deputy commerce secretary, met with Shi
Guangsheng, the Chinese foreign trade minister, and two other
senior Chinese officials to discuss a number of commercial issues.
Yet the Chinese officials only talked about trade organization
membership indirectly, Aaron said, and they showed no willingness
to establish a timetable for new negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're still waiting,'' Aaron said. ``The decision
remains to be theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have said they are still determined to enter
the trade organization, the 134-nation group that makes the rules
of global commerce, by the end of the year. Entry would require
approval of the United States and other big influential members of
the group.
</P>
<P>
   Yet China and the United States have been unable to recover the
ground lost in April when President Clinton rejected a proposed
deal, with significant concessions, offered by Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji during a visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Widely criticized for missing the opportunity, President Clinton
later reversed himself and expressed a willingness to close a deal
quickly. But before it could be secured, NATO bombed the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia on May 7 and seriously angered Beijing. Talks
on trade organization membership, human rights and security issues
were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing and Washington still cannot agree on how the United
States should compensate China for the three Chinese journalists
who were killed in the attack, which NATO has called unintentional.
Chinese officials have been unwilling to reopen trade organization
negotiations until the compensation issue is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said he found it encouraging that Chinese officials
invited him to China at all. In addition, he said, Chinese
officials told him repeatedly that Beijing wanted to strengthen its
relationship with Washington. They also refrained from lecturing
him about U.S. faults, as Chinese officials often do when ties at
their worst.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said that he and Shi agreed to lead a meeting of a joint
commercial forum later this year in Beijing with U.S. Commerce
Secretary William Daley. An exact date was not set.
</P>
<P>
   The forum, called the Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade,
will include working groups to meet on information technology,
aviation, environmental technology and other areas, Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said he thought it still possible that an agreement could
be reached on trade organization membership this year. Other
officials have said that reaching a deal this year will only be
possible if endorsed by Presidents Clinton and China's President
Jiang Zemin when they meet in New Zealand in September at the Asia
Pacific Economic Conference.

 &HT;    Buying spree over, Cox to emphasize qualityBy Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since April, Cox Communications has spent $10.15
billion in cash and stock to buy cable TV systems nationwide _
including a $2.7 billion play announced Tuesday _ but the company
still ranks number five in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with this Atlanta-based cable TV operator, which has
stressed quality over size. Now the company is wrapping up its
buying binge and returning to a focus on execution.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the recent focus on acquisitions wasn't
important. The company had to get much bigger to remain
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   But what Cox Communications bought was not so much bulk as
market share in key regions. No cable TV operator dominates more
lucrative big city markets than Cox Communications.
</P>
<P>
   It owns such markets as New England, Northern Virginia, Southern
California, Phoenix, Ariz. and now Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically, Cox Communications remains a strong second tier
player _ despite all their spending,'' says Bruce Leichtman, a
media analyst at industry consultant the Yankee Group. ``But in
terms of cable TV plant, market share and quality of service, Cox
Communications is second to none.''
</P>
<P>
   In its latest deal, announced Tuesday, Cox Communications will
pay $2.7 billion in cash to buy cable operator Multimedia
Cablevision, owned by media giant Gannett Co.
</P>
<P>
   Multimedia Cablevision serves 522,000 subscribers in Kansas,
Oklahoma and North Carolina. In Oklahoma, for example, Cox
Communications will now have 490,000 subscribers, a commanding
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is paying the equivalent of $4,500 a
subscriber for Gannett's properties, among the higher prices paid
for cable systems. It's a price more than double what systems
fetched two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While expensive, the purchase has been structured in a way to
give Cox Communications $350 million in tax benefits, say company
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications says the deal is well worth the price. It
will push the company beyond the 6 million mark in terms of
subscribers, making it approximately fifth in size among operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that 6 million customers is a formidable size in
today's environment,'' says Cox Communications Chief Executive and
President Jim Robbins. ``Our recent acquisitions provide us the
size and scale that will enable us to remain a significant player
in the broadband communications industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's deal caps a four-month period in which Cox
Communications, through acquisition, has added 2 million
subscribers, growing its base by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, for example, Cox announced it would trade
$2.8 billion in AT&AMP;T stock for systems in the south-central part of
the country. The systems are now owned by that long distance
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   These systems, will add 495,000 subscribers in Louisiana,
Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas, fill in a cluster of cable TV systems
Cox Communications has been building in this region.
</P>
<P>
   And in May Cox Communications agreed to pay $4 billion in cash
and stock to buy TCA Cable TV, based in Tyler, Texas. TCA has
883,000 customers in systems in small to mid-sized towns across
Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   These deals leave Cox Communications' systems clustered in four
regions, New England, the Southwest, Virginia and the South-Central
states.
</P>
<P>
   That footprint isn't as extensive as that of industry leader
AT&AMP;T, which will have some 17 million cable TV subscribers when it
closes its purchase of MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox Communications' holdings are in markets with not only
lots of high income families but those interested in digital
services.
</P>
<P>
   Examples include its systems in New England and in San Diego and
Orange County, California. These are areas with some of the highest
usage of computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems are critical to Cox Communications' strategy. The
company has positioned itself as a leader in providing digital
services such as high-speed access to the Internet, vast new
channel offerings, digital television and telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as delivering all three of these services at the same
time, Cox Communications is the leader,'' says Leichtman. ``And
they are neck and neck with MediaOne in providing telephone
service.''
</P>
<P>
   As of June, for example, Cox Communications had 59,793 telephone
customers across its systems. There were 112,006 Internet
subscribers as of the same date.
</P>
<P>
   While these numbers represent only a small portion of Cox
Communications' subscribers, they are heading up every quarter. And
that's good news for Cox Communications, which has invested heavily
in a digital future.
</P>
<P>
   The company has spent heavily in the past five years to turn its
systems into digital networks. And that, in turn, has required the
company to expand in order to justify the high cost of
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable operators need a critical mass of subscribers to deliver
digital services,'' says Leichtman. ``It helps in both deploying
the services and marketing them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gannett purchase dovetails with Cox Communications'
strategy. Nearly 90 percent of its systems in Oklahoma and North
Carolina are digital, which will expedite Cox Communications'
ability to offer Internet access and telephone service to these
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gannett's cable properties are a natural fit with our growth
strategy of adding large, technologically advanced properties in
stand-alone markets and in markets contiguous to our existing
operations,'' says Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Gannett marks a strategic shift at Cox
Communications. ``This is it,'' says Robbins about whether the
company plans other acquisitions. The reason is twofold.
</P>
<P>
   First, there aren't many good independent systems left for sale.
``Two years ago, the purchase of Gannett wouldn't have been a big
deal,'' says Leichtman. ``That it is (now) shows how few good
systems are left.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, Cox Communications has reached critical mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cox Communications is pretty set now,'' says Spencer Grimes, a
media analyst with New York investment bank Solomon Smith Barney.
He says that 6 million is a good size for Cox Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins agrees. He says the focus of his company now will be
``execution, execution, execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins says the company's challenge is rolling out digital
services without affecting the company's quality of service.
</P>
<P>
   Robbin's acquisition campaign has also increased his company's
size and importance within controlling shareholder Cox Enterprises
Inc., which also owns the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, a privately-held diversified media company, owns 73.3
percent of Cox Communications. Last year, according to the latest
figures, Cox Communications represented slightly less than a third
of its parent's $5.4 billion in revenue, outstripping both the
newspaper and broadcast divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Cox does not release sales figures for any of its private
divisions.

 &HT;    SUMMIT FAILS TO PRODUCE PROGRESS IN WYE PEACE PROCESS
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ They kept up the honeymoon atmosphere, but new
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in a meeting with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat Tuesday maintained a freeze on
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1/2 hour meeting at the Erez Crossing Point between
Israel and the Gaza Strip, Barak asked Arafat for more time before
resuming land transfers planned in the Wye River Memorandum. Arafat
agreed to consider the request for two weeks, while aides try to
find middle ground between Barak's plea and Arafat's insistence
that Wye be resumed as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli land handovers planned in Wye are already more than
five months late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must seek the precise and accurate implementation of
agreements signed on the basis of reciprocity,'' Arafat said in a
joint news conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was elected in May promising to restart the peace process
that had been halted by predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu. Now, he
appears to be having some of the same hesitations about
implementing the Wye accords -- that it could leave Israelis
vulnerable to terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to merge the Wye land transfers into negotiations
over remaining major issues in the peace process. But unlike
Netanyahu, he is seeking Palestinian approval and has stayed on
cordial terms with the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like again to emphasize that we are committed to Wye.
We will implement Wye,'' Barak said. ``Any change in the agreement
will be made only by the consent of both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   By asking for consent, Barak maintains his image as the team
player. But he also keeps the process frozen in the meantime -- a
condition that cannot be peacefully maintained for long.
</P>
<P>
   Tension in the region has risen steadily following the high
expectations after Barak's election victory. This was the third
time the two have met but the first two meetings were largely
ceremonial, including one at Sunday's funeral of Morocco's King
Hassan II. Pressure is building for some substantive results.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly restless Palestinians have waited as Barak has
traveled to the United States, Great Britain, Egypt and Jordan to
discuss the peace process. He goes to Russia next week, a trip sure
to be a political success with the 1 million Russian immigrants in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A militant Palestinian group opposed to peace with Israel
recently announced that it would renew efforts to commit terror
attacks and Israel's Chief of Staff, Shaul Mofaz, reported Tuesday
that small terror attempts were increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show most Palestinians do not trust Barak and many are
growing impatient with Arafat, who led them into the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two leaders cannot afford a failure,'' said Palestinian
political analyst Ghassan Khatib. ``Arafat is desperate for some
progress and he cannot say that this (Israeli) government that we
have waited for is not giving anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Signed at the White House in October, the Wye River Memorandum
laid out a three-month timetable for the transfer of 13 percent of
land in the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, it would give the Palestinians control of 40
percent of the West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan in
1967. Although Israel has not made the West Bank formally part of
the country, about 180,000 Jewish settlers have been scattered amid
the 1.5 million Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye plan was actually a refinement of the Oslo peace
process, signed in 1993. Then-Prime Minister Netanyahu, who had
early on opposed Oslo, froze the process claiming that the
Palestinians were not doing enough to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has been seeking ways to restructure the Wye deal and meld
it into the so-called ``permanent status'' discussions of the
toughest issues at stake. These include the control of Jerusalem
and whether 3.5 million Palestinian refugees can return to land in
Israel they lost in wars.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians oppose delaying Wye because it lets Israel hold
land as a bargaining chip in the permanent status talks. Israelis
are hesitant to cede land unless they are confident the permanent
status issues can be resolved and end Palestinian resistance to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak fears that Wye will leave several Jewish settlements
isolated and vulnerable to Arab attacks. He also opposes the deep
involvement of the U.S. CIA, which is called upon in Wye to monitor
Palestinian compliance with the plan. U.S. officials during the
Netanyahu era rarely criticized Palestinian compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the land transfers planned in Wye, Israel is supposed
to allow the Palestinians to construct a long-delayed port, which
would create thousands of jobs, and let Palestinians have ``safe
passage'' routes through Israel to their enclaves in the Gaza Strip
and the West Bank.

U.N. FINDS NO EVIDENCE OF WAR-RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IN
KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
 (With KOSOVO-SOLDIERS)

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A United Nations environmental team has
found no evidence of a major ecological catastrophe in Yugoslavia
as a result of NATO's bombing war, its leader said Tuesday. But he
urged the West to provide immediate aid to help clean up
significant ``hot spots'' of war-related pollution.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference to discuss preliminary findings from the
10-day inspection visit, Pekka Haavisto, a former Finnish
environment minister and chairman of the U.N.'s Balkan Task Force,
said: ``We talk about chosen hot spots where immediate action has
to take place, but not about a major ecocide or country-wide
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, environmental damage in heavily bombed
industrial towns like Pancevo, Kragujevac and Bor needed immediate
attention to protect the health of ordinary citizens, and added,
when asked, that the West should help.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury released by the bombing of industrial targets is
contaminating Pancevo. And in Kragujevac, where the Zastava car
factory was bombed, there are high levels of PCBs. In Bor, the
problem is acid rain, which could be affecting areas beyond
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most difficult problems the team faced, Haavisto
said, was distinguishing between pre-existing environmental damage
in Yugoslavia _ an Eastern European country that has had nine years
of economic sanctions _ and damage caused by the war.
</P>
<P>
   In Pancevo, for instance, where a major petrochemical factory, a
refinery and a fertilizer factory were bombed repeatedly, mercury
lies in pools and should be cleaned up even before any other effort
is made at reconstruction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if it was safe to eat fish from the Danube, he
hesitated, saying that local officials had lifted a ban on river
fish and that they were honest in their assessments. Still, he
said, he would not let fishing continue in a mile-long channel near
Pancevo where effluent from the three factories enters the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found very dangerous chemicals there,'' he said. ``But how
dangerous it is to the whole Danube we cannot say.''
</P>
<P>
   Existing cleaning mechanisms were overwhelmed by the water used
to try to put out the fires and by the lack of electricity or
chemical supplies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Haavisto said the original state of environmental pollution in
Pancevo was high, though the bombing had worsened it. The effects
of the ``black rain'' in Pancevo, when burning factory fires sent
pollutants and chemicals into the air, had now passed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some very worrying findings, but in some sites where
there was a lot of worry we found nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the initial findings did not show an increased level of
radioactivity from any bombs containing depleted uranium, as was
feared. But he noted there might be other consequences from trace
elements that still need to be examined.
</P>
<P>
   And in Nis, for example, local fears about depleted uranium and
the leakage of PCB's into the ground and ground water proved
unfounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bor, at a copper factory, the problems are worsened by a lack
of electricity to run equipment that would stabilize sulfur or run
pumping stations, and so sulfur dioxide is being emitted into the
air, causing acid rain and likely traveling across borders.
</P>
<P>
   NATO countries are divided on how much and what kind of help to
provide Yugoslavia. The United States has refused to consider any
reconstruction aid while President Slobodan Milosevic is in power,
saying it will provide only relief assistance. The European Union
is urging broader aid to repair the electrical system before the
winter. But Washington has begun to discuss how to get aid to
individual cities, especially those run by the opposition to
Milosevic, and Pancevo and Kragujevac both are opposition-run.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Haavisto danced carefully around the political
issues, stressing that the report of the U.N. team would be given
to Secretary-General Kofi Annan in about a month, after more
detailed laboratory tests and evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Haavisto said that the Yugoslav authorities were helpful and the
team, which also went to Novi Sad, Kraljevo, and Prahavo, visited
any site he chose except for those in Kosovo where land mines
remain.
</P>
<P>
   Predrag S. Polic, a chemistry professor at Belgrade University,
praised the team for its dedication and patience. ``There is a lot
of anxiety and emotions because of the war and a lot of fear about
health, and I hope things will improve,'' he said. ``The hot spots
are very bad, but large areas are only temporarily affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Yugoslavia's climate, with wind, rain, rivers and
vegetation, ``self-purification here is good,'' Polic said. ``It's
not like Iraq.''

ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS MAY PROMPT LOS ANGELES TO SCUTTLE NEW
SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It looms on a lonely lot at the edge of downtown,
a hulking pile of buff brick and brown stone, like some
half-finished temple or Pharaoh's tomb. If would be the most
expensive public high school ever built in the United States, at a
cost of more than $200 million, but the Belmont Learning Center may
never be finished _ and if it is, no one may want to go to school
there.
</P>
<P>
   The school was built atop an abandoned oil field, despite
repeated warnings, and officials now say there may be no way to
vent away seeping methane gas and other hazards to make the
building safe to occupy. Last week, the Los Angeles Board of
Education, with four newly elected members, voted to create a
commission to recommend whether to abandon the project, after $125
million has already been spent on it, or to spend millions more to
make it work.
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont story is a classic Los Angeles tale of sunny civic
boosterism and noir real estate speculation. It is also a tale of
the ever-present environmental hazards in a city that a century ago
was a sparsely populated outpost dotted with oil wells and bean
fields and is now a metropolis built astride constantly shifting
earthquake faults. As the drama has dragged on for more than a
decade, the problem that Belmont was meant to address _ severe
overcrowding in schools in the city's downtown neighborhoods _ has
remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to go away,'' said state Sen. Tom Hayden of Los
Angeles, one of the Belmont project's most persistent critics,
noting what he sees as a no-win situation. ``If they abandon it,
it's going to be the subject of screenplays and East Coast
merriment for years. And if they open it, they're going to face
endless litigation by parents who think it's going to one day be
the site of a methane fire or explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort began more than a decade ago with a plan to build a
high school on the site of the old Ambassador Hotel, the once-grand
hostlery where Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated in June 1968
after winning California's Democratic presidential primary. The
school district condemned the property, but its owner, the New York
developer Donald Trump, who wanted to build a skyscraper on the
site, threatened a legal challenge over the price. In the real
estate recession of the early 1990s, the Board of Education dropped
that location in favor of one of the last remaining open parcels of
land near downtown, a former oilfield at First Street and Beaudry
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the plan envisioned what school officials
said would be the most expensive high school in the country, a
5,300-student complex comprising eight ``academies,'' plus a
housing and retail development that would be built in an unusual
partnership with a private developer, Kajima Urban Development. But
the retail and housing elements have long since been dropped, in
part because retail tenants were not interested in the somewhat
isolated site, a gritty hillside near the intersection of two
freeways.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1993, officials of the state Division of Oil and Gas
warned Los Angeles school officials about the dangers of building
over an abandoned oil field, but the school district and the
developer forged ahead, taking soil samples that district officials
and outside critics now say were clearly inadequate. The outside
legal counsel for the Board of Education, David Cartwright of the
city's leading law firm, O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, helped negotiate with
the developer, Kajima, and assured the board that it was safe to go
forward without a full environmental study. It was later disclosed
that his firm also represented the developer, a subsidiary of a
giant Japanese construction company.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright has defended his actions as proper, but last winter
the school board relieved him of duties on the Belmont project,
although he continues as counsel on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Construction began two years ago, with just two dissenting votes
on the seven-member school board. But before the groundbreaking,
Assemblyman Scott Wildman, who represents the nearby communities of
Glendale and Burbank and heads the Joint Legislative Audit
Committee, which has oversight of public entities like school
districts, had begun raising questions about contracting and safety
issues for the project. He urged the district to hold off.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Wildman has made public nine reports that are
critical of the plan, and environmental consultants hired by the
district have found dangerous concentrations of methane as well as
hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas with the sickening smell of rotten
eggs that can cause neurological damage.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the district's own experts have suggested that the
entire first floor of the building should be off-limits to
children, to protect them from any buildup of dangerous gases. Even
if a system could be devised to vent the dangerous gases, reports
have suggested, it would cost perhaps $100,000 a year to operate it
for the life of the school. And an earthquake fault running under
the property could leave the mechanical systems subject to sudden
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the project should be abandoned and torn down,''
Wildman said in a recent interview. ``There shouldn't be children
who go there and there shouldn't be people who work there. They
made a mistake. We tried to stop them before they started, but they
went ahead anyway. Frankly, they should have made the decision two
years ago.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But a range of local officials, including Mayor Richard J.
Riordan, had supported the project, and it was not until last fall,
when the state Department of Toxic Substance Control concluded that
the site had never been adequately assessed, that momentum grew for
re-evaluation. After commissioning new tests, the district
suspended most construction in February.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatives would be expensive, including building several
smaller high schools in the area at a cost of perhaps $75 million
each.
</P>
<P>
   A new, four-member majority was elected to the school board this
spring on a promise to take a hard look at the Belmont project.
They had been expected to call a permanent halt to the scheme,
perhaps last week. Instead, after a daylong closed session and a
spirited public hearing last Tuesday, the board voted to secure the
site by installing doors, windows and roofing to protect it from
the elements, but postponed a definitive decision on its future.
The board appointed a citizens' commission that will make
recommendations by mid-October, and imposed a gag order on its
members and the district staff, barring any comment on the project
in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems with this project is there hasn't been a
great deal of planning ahead,'' said one of the new board members,
Caprice Young.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the environmental controversy, several parents testified
at the hearing in support of finishing the school, saying the
neighborhood badly needed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concerns are not being heard and we are more overcrowded
than ever,'' said Tina Hough, a 35-year resident of the
neighborhood who had been bused to far-flung neighborhoods to go to
school. ``Am I to put my children through the same thing I went
through.?''
</P>
<P>
   Dominic Shambra, a now retired school official who had overseen
the Belmont project as the district's director of planning and
development, also testified. He dismissed the environmental
concerns as ``unsubstantiated allegations,'' and told board
members: ``You are now surrounded by an environmental hysteria
created by the district's own consultants.'' He said the problems
could be remedied and that conclusions that the site is beyond
repair are exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   But Wildman said it was too late to make the project work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one thing after another,'' he said. ``We keep
finding more problems. Bureaucrats need to have permission to cut
their losses and stop throwing good money after bad.''

`CHICAGO HOPE' RETURNING AFTER MAJOR SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ They didn't line up the ``Chicago Hope''
actors and shoot them at the end of last season, perhaps because it
would have been a shame to waste perfectly good ammo on actors.
</P>
<P>
   But the result was about the same.
</P>
<P>
   In a startling season finale, Mandy Patinkin returned to the CBS
medical drama as Dr. Jeffrey Geiger and bluntly fired most of the
doctors at the fictional Chicago hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say, most of the cast. The victims were Christine
Lahti, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Peter Berg, Jayne Brook, Stacy Edwards
and Eric Stoltz.
</P>
<P>
   The cast members learned their fates just about as abruptly as
their characters did. One studio insider told me this week that
Lahti, an Emmy winner for ``Chicago Hope,'' was so upset by the
massacre that she initially balked at playing her climactic scene
with Patinkin.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, ``Chicago Hope'' will return for a sixth season with
a different focus, a rejiggered cast and, it seems, some unresolved
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   During a press event in Pasadena to promote the show, CBS spread
11 producers and cast members across a stage. Anyone in the room
could sense about four different climatic zones in the 30 feet or
so from Patinkin on one end to Hector Elizondo on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone up there, it seemed, was terrifically fond of
everyone else. That shouldn't be surprising, really; it's true
among most job entourages. But seldom so palpable.
</P>
<P>
   The returnees besides Elizondo are Rocky Carroll, Mark Harmon
and Adam Arkin. Patinkin, who left ``Chicago Hope'' after its first
season, is back for an undetermined number of episodes. It will
probably be plenty; maybe nine or 10 out of the season's first
dozen, for starters.
</P>
<P>
   That group is joined by newcomers Lauren Holly as a plastic
surgeon, Barbara Hershey as a thoracic surgeon who seems destined
to butt heads with Patinkin's Geiger, and Carla Gugino as a
neurosurgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The show's prolific creator, David E. Kelley _ he also produces
``Ally McBeal,'' the half-hour ``Ally'' spin-off, ``The Practice''
and a new ABC series, ``Snoops'' _ said he's written the new
season's first episode and will keep closer tabs on ``Chicago
Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said the purge was more or less a matter of having to
destroy the show in order to save it.
</P>
<P>
   ```Chicago Hope' was in trouble in terms of getting renewed,''
he said. ``Along with that, Mandy had expressed an interest in
coming back. We met with CBS and pretty much agreed that in order
for `Chicago Hope' to come back, it would really have to be reborn.
Sweeping changes would have to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   One change is a shift in dramatic direction. CBS, according to
the 20th Century Fox Television source, ordered the show to shift
emphasis a few seasons ago from the hospital to the character's
personal lives. A mistake. This fall, the hospital will re-emerge
and the practice of medicine will be in vogue again.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the delicate matter of sorting out the cast.
Kelley said he started as any humane manager would, with natural
attrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Berg was developing his own pilot, and so he figured not
to be around,'' Kelley said. ``And Christine Lahti's directing
career was heating up, and there was a good chance she wouldn't
want to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said Brook was cut because her role was closely tied to
Berg's. Curtis-Hall's character ``seemed to be evolving into one
that was getting frustrated with medicine.'' Not anymore. Gone.
Stoltz had a one-year deal to appear on the show. Also gone.
Edwards was ``pretty arbitrary for me'' because ``I didn't really
have a strong sense of that character.''
</P>
<P>
   Lahti wasn't a favorite among all her colleagues, but the
wholesale slaughter has tested the professional mettle of Elizondo,
Harmon, Carroll and Arkin. Arkin seemed readiest to speak, however
cautiously, for the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy we're still here,'' he said. ``I don't think David
was kidding when he said the future of the show probably hung in
the balance. ... There was some press I received in which I talked
about how hard it was to see people we'd worked with for such a
long time have to be surprised with their own departures.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkin went on to say that it was ``wonderful we have a future''
but added, ``I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a hard way to end the
season. It was traumatic in its own way. But I guess, on some
level, it had to be.''
</P>
<P>
   While the additions give ``Chicago Hope'' one of TV's most
impressive casts, the show has hardly recovered from its radical
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   It's moving, again, this time from Wednesdays to Thursdays. Want
to watch ``Chicago Hope''? It'll be on at 9 p.m., against NBC's
``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   Prognosis? One more year, but a good one.

 &HT;    SEC Notebook: Fumble still haunts Arkansas' Stoerner
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM _ Perhaps the most talked about play in the
Southeastern Conference last year was Arkansas quarterback Clint
Stoerner's fumble with 1:43 remaining and the Razorbacks holding a
24-21 lead on Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols, of course, came back to score the winning touchdown
with 28 seconds left and went on to take the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Stoerner was forced to relive the infamous incident
during the first day of the three-day annual SEC Football Kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get mad at you for asking me that question, because
I've asked myself the same question a hundred times,'' he said.
``It has been hard to swallow, but it's something that comes with
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he be able to put it behind him? ``Can I get it out of my
mind? Not a chance,'' Stoerner said. ``I'll never forget it, and
even if I could, you guys wouldn't let me.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior said he received about 180 E-mails after the game,
and all but two were positive. ``These two guys were dog-cussing me
for fumbling the ball, but most of the others were very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick, very sick,'' Arkansas coach Houston Nutt said
about the fumble. ``I felt like the game was won, and it's a very
sick feeling. The bad thing was we woke up about 110,000 people.
That crowd was very quiet until the fumble.''
</P>
<P>
   Late starters
</P>
<P>
   Georgia head coach Jim Donnan explained the Bulldogs' loss to
Florida this way: ``We thought the game started at 4:30 (p.m.), but
it started at 4, and it was 21-0 fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan on how the game has changed since he played quarterback
for N.C. State: ``Well, they're wearing face masks now.''
</P>
<P>
   And on his Bulldogs' record over the past few years: ``There are
only eight teams in the country who've won more games than we did
in the last two years, but unfortunately, two of those are teams
we've got to beat (Florida and Tennessee), and they've won a whole
lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   On why some schools don't play more top-level out-of-conference
games: ``It's hard to play what we call 11 Ben Hurs in a season,
every game being an epic.''
</P>
<P>
   Changeovers aplenty
</P>
<P>
   Gerry DiNardo, LSU head coach, says money is the main reason for
the turnover in head coaches around the country. ``I know we're
adding seats, and we'll have 91,600 by the year 2000. That means
there will be another 10,000 coaches and coordinators at each
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning point
</P>
<P>
   LSU defensive tackle Johnny Mitchell didn't hesitate to point to
the start of the Tigers' downward spiral last season. LSU had been
picked to win the SEC Western Division but finished 4-7. ``The
Georgia game in the fourth quarter was the turning point of the
season,'' Mitchell said. LSU was 3-0 and ranked No. 6 in the
country when the Bulldogs beat them 28-27. ``We never seemed to be
able to come back from that,'' Mitchell said. ``We lost a lot of
games in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick kicks
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern Conference football championship game, which
will be played in The Georgia Dome the first weekend in December,
sold out on June 11. . . . The difference in the SEC Football
Kickoff and the ACC Football Kickoff, held last week, can be
measured in numbers. Some 125 media representatives attended the
ACC meetings. The SEC get-together drew more than 650 media
requests. . . . DiNardo is the first coach to last at least five
seasons at LSU since Charlie McClendon, who left in 1979. . . .
Donnan's picks for who's going to be good this season in college
football: Arizona, Florida State and Penn State. . . . And finally,
Georgia's Orantes Grant on whether the Bulldogs are closing the
talent gap on Tennessee and Florida: ``I don't think we've ever
been behind them. It was more a couple of bad breaks, a couple of
bad games, a lack of focus.''

HIGH COST AND CORRUPTION PREVENTS NEW CONSTRUCTION, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Texas)  (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A study commissioned by New York City has found that
the cost of residential construction in the five boroughs is the
highest in the country, with pervasive corruption, outdated
regulations and excessive labor and material costs continuing to
make it prohibitively expensive to build new homes.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that it costs an average of $183,000 to build
one apartment in a typical six-story building in New York City.
That is 22 percent higher than Dallas, 10 percent more than Chicago
and 4 percent higher than Los Angeles, where added costs to reduce
earthquake damage narrow the gap.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, residential construction in New York City has
failed to keep pace with demand, the report says, pointing out that
although building permits for 52,000 new units were issued between
1980 and 1996, the city's population grew by 120,000 households
during that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shortfall contributes to low vacancy rates, skyrocketing
rents and incredible rent-to-income burdens,'' said one of the
report's authors, Michael Schill, the director of the Center for
Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of
Law. ``We found that rents in New York are the highest in the
nation, and that one out of four renter households pays more than
half its income for rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor is by far the largest contributor to the higher costs. The
report said the base hourly wage and fringe-benefit rate for
bricklayers in the city is $46.64, 35 percent more than Chicago, 42
percent more than Los Angeles and 155 percent more than Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   While the cost of living has long kept wages high in New York,
labor costs are also inflated, the report says, because of
featherbedding and inefficient work rules, like the requirements
that plumbers install toilet paper holders and electricians install
mail boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The report was commissioned by the city's Department of Housing
Preservation and Development and the New York City Partnership and
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Among the report's major recommendations are a ``broad
redrafting'' of the city's 38-year-old zoning code, which it calls
``arcane and byzantine''; replacement of the building code with a
model code written by a national engineering association to reflect
current construction technology; and elimination of environmental
reviews for new buildings, those with 90 apartments or less, and
those with 150 apartments of affordable housing for the poor.
Currently, all buildings with three or more apartments require an
environmental review.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that ``contrary to allegations of some
members of the real estate industry, rent regulation is unlikely''
to contribute to higher building costs, except when a developer
seeks to demolish an old building. In that situation, the report
calls for the rewriting of the rent law to allow for the removal of
holdout tenants, with fair compensation, if the new building will
have 20 percent more floor space than the demolished one.
</P>
<P>
   In conducting the study, the authors retained architects to draw
up specifications for a town house, a six-story apartment house and
a 15-story luxury building. Then they compared construction-cost
estimates for New York with those in Chicago, Los Angeles and
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Schill called the cost gaps ``extremely conservative, because
they factor out the far higher costs of land and soft costs,'' like
professional fees in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Along with wage rates and inefficient union rules, the report
cites corruption as a significant contributor to high labor costs
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extortion, bid-rigging, bribery and other illegal practices
are pervasive in the construction industry,'' it says. ``These
illegal practices often take place because organized crime has
infiltrated labor unions and construction companies.''
</P>
<P>
   While federal officials have been cracking down on corruption in
some of the city's largest building unions, the report says that
more needs to be done. It recommends that the city create a
commission to investigate and license all construction managers to
weed out those connected to organized crime, something Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani has already proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommends that builders and labor unions
``negotiate a lower wage rate for construction outside the central
core of Manhattan,'' and that wages ``reflect the complexity of
construction, and vary depending upon whether the development is
low-, mid- or high-rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. Malloy, president of the city's Building and
Construction Trades Council, questioned the cost estimates in the
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing good-sized projects in the Bronx and have
negotiated agreements on these projects that brought the price down
to a number that the construction manager and the developer found
competitive,'' he said. ``I do not believe that there's that big a
disparity in the wage package between New York, Chicago and Los
Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the report's conclusions regarding featherbedding
and corruption, Malloy said: ``If you told me that 10 years ago, I
would probably agree with you. But in today's market, all the
agreements have been changed to reflect the competitive market, and
most of the so-called featherbedding clauses have been
eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The report says that a major reason why material costs in New
York are excessive is that the city's building code is
``stringent'' and ``cumbersome.'' The report cites as one example
that plastic pipe can be used only in one- and two-family buildings
in New York, while other cities allow it in larger buildings.
</P>
<P>
   And the report says the city's zoning regulations ``can only be
described as arcane and byzantine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only experts can wade through the multiple levels of
regulation that may affect a single piece of property,'' it says.
``This discourages new developers from entering the market and
expanding the capacity of the city to produce housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Salama, who wrote the report with Schill and another
professor, Martha Stark, said that to meet housing needs the city
must convert more manufacturing areas to residential use, something
that zoning rules inhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we recommend,'' Salama said, ``is that the mayor and the
city council create a task force to undertake a broad redraft of
the zoning resolution with the driving vision being to make it
easier and more cost-effective to build housing.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development,
Richard T. Roberts, called the study ``a very good document,'' and
said, ``It really reaches the mark in terms of outlining specific
steps that can be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to consult with the mayor, the City Council and
policymakers in Albany,'' Roberts said, ``and see how many of these
recommendations we can put into effect in the next couple of
years.''

FIRST LADY PROMOTES CAMPAIGN ISSUES IN WHIRLWIND DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton capitalized on
her White House role Tuesday to showcase support for women, the
poor and Jewish voters _ all potentially important constituencies
in her possible Senate campaign from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady staged four public appearances across the
nation's capital in barely 10 hours, setting the stage for
resumption of her summer-long, campaign-style ``listening tour''
across New York on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Washington whirlwind also appeared designed in part to
steal some of the thunder from her most likely Republican rival for
the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has criticized the first
lady for being an Illinois-born, Arkansas-based carpetbagger
candidate in New York, traveled to the Clintons' turf in Arkansas
Tuesday to highlight his criticisms and raise money for his own
burgeoning Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With no additional public events on her schedule before she
leaves for New York on Thursday, the first lady's rapid-fire
appearances here marked the end of a self-imposed moratorium on
campaign activities following the death of and memorial services
for John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her
sister, Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to return to the Empire State Thursday for a third
campaign-related foray since creating a campaign fund-raising
committee on July 6. She plans visits to Elmira, Bath and Ithaca
before returning to Washington on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, appearing twice with President Clinton at the
White House, struck the partisan themes of a prospective Senate
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   She challenged the Republican leadership in Congress to enact
the Clinton administration's proposed overhaul of Medicare, saying
changes are needed to provide better health care to elderly women
who make up 60 percent of the nearly 40 million people on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Later, during an East Room appearance to celebrate the 25th
anniversary of the Legal Services Corp., Clinton warned that ``we
again face a challenge from those in Congress who are working to
slash'' a $300 million-a-year federal program that recruits 150,000
volunteer lawyers nationwide to provide representation for civil
suits by the poor, regardless of ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, noting that nearly half the 40 million Americans in
poverty are children, said expanded efforts are needed to make sure
that the poor have legal representation to obtain child support,
health care for children, adequate housing, nursing home care and
protection from physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Without the help of Legal Services Corp.'s 258 legal aid
programs across the country, ``many of those children and their
parents would have no place to turn,'' said Clinton, who served as
chairwoman of the organization from 1978 to 1980 while her husband
was governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the first lady:
</P>
<P>
   _ Presided over the National Jewish Democratic Council's
presentation of a humanitarian award to honor former Democratic
Party Chairman Steve Grossman and his wife Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   _ Received the Henrietta Szold Humanitarian Award from the
87-year-old Hadassah Jewish women's organization for her efforts on
behalf of issues ``critical to women and families.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stepped up her campaign-related activities a day after
the release of a Zogby New York poll of 709 likely voters in the
state showing the first lady continuing to trail Giuliani in a
hypothetical Senate contest.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, completed on July 19 and released Monday, showed
Giuliani leading Clinton 49 percent to 39 percent overall in a
general election contest. Giuliani's 10 percentage point edge was
double his advantage in a Zogby survey completed in May.
</P>
<P>
   But the same survey underscored Clinton's intent to appeal to
women, who favored the first lady over Giuliani 44 percent to 42
percent, according to the Zogby survey.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks about Medicare, Clinton said elderly women stand
to benefit the most from the administration's efforts to ``save and
modernize Medicare.'' These women, she said, ``struggle to pay for
out-patient prescription drugs'' and ``skip regular screenings and
check-ups that would enhance the quality of their lives and reduce
Medicare's long-term costs,'' the first lady said.
</P>
<P>
   Women, the poor and Jewish voters proved to be valuable sources
of Democratic support for then-Rep. Charles Schumer in his 1998
upset of the incumbent Republican senator, Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer defeated D'Amato, 55 percent to 45 percent. The Democrat
carried 59 percent of the women's vote, 59 percent of the vote of
voters with incomes of less than $15,000 and 76 percent of the
Jewish vote, according to exit polls.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's appearances came as White House Press
Secretary Joe Lockhart formally announced that the first family
will divide its summer vacation between Martha's Vineyard, Mass.,
and New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons will spend nine days on the Massachusetts vacation
island of Cape Cod, beginning Aug. 19, followed by seven days in
New York state _ a two-day weekend in posh East Hampton, N.Y., on
the eastern end of Long Island and five days in Skaneateles, N.Y.,
a 205-year-old lakefront community on Lake Skaneateles, one of the
six largest of the 11 Finger Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart emphasized that the Clintons plan no political
activities once they arrive in Skaneateles on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were looking for a place to go to spend the rest
of the vacation beyond Martha's Vineyard, and there are a lot of
people who recommended this part of New York, and they're very much
looking forward to spending some time there,'' Lockhart said.

GLORIFYING GOVERNMENTS IS ALSO AN ART  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ All governments engage in, even require, propaganda
to reinforce their authority and disseminate their policies. Made
by human beings, governments naturally like to look good.
</P>
<P>
   They show distinct preferences for glory, no matter what their
actual circumstances. So the powers that be build monuments, put
victory and liberty on coins, establish patriotic celebrations,
fabricate myths.
</P>
<P>
   The word propaganda comes from the Latin phrase for propagating
the Christian faith; it acquired a generally pejorative sense only
in World War I, when governments took strict control of war
information that could be used in the mass media. Long before,
every medium that could spread ideologies or enhance renown and
power had been called upon to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Popes and kings and dictators commissioned architecture,
sculpture and painting, enlisted playwrights and speakers, and
hired designers to shape the ruler's image and fashion the
servants' livery as well as the military's uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   When photography came along, it, too, was soon pressed into
service. French and British royalty in the mid-19th century started
by posing with their families so that their subjects might feel a
certain warmth of kinship with their emperors and queens.
</P>
<P>
   During the technical peace of the 1930s, Germany, the Soviet
Union and the United States took the uses of propaganda, beneficent
or otherwise, to new levels. Two major _ one might even say
resounding _ governmental photographic programs in that decade are
explored and compared in ``Propaganda and Dreams: Photographing the
1930s in the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.,'' at the Corcoran Gallery in
Washington through Oct. 3. Here, even the dreams look like
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   This enormous and instructive show of 232 images, including a
few posters and photographically illustrated books and magazines,
is accompanied by a catalog written by the curator, Leah
Bendavid-Val.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition offers some previously unknown photographs from
both countries as well as such revealing items as a second version
of Alexander Rodchenko's well-known ``Pioneer Girl'' and a variant
of Dorothea Lange's picture of a migrant worker's wife with her
hand to her head, apparently more posed than candid. These
reminders of photographers' ways of working hint at how artfully
constructed and determinedly willed was the persuasiveness of their
images.
</P>
<P>
   Lenin, who regarded art as an educational tool, called for
central government oversight of all kinds of information. The
Soviet system aimed not only at educating the illiterate masses but
also at reconstituting humanity by creating a new and more
harmonious individual, a project that could be furthered by keeping
examples before the public's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   All published and professional photography was essentially
Soviet government photography, as the government controlled all
publications. At one point, photographers were ordered to hand over
their negatives so they could not be used commercially.
Nonetheless, Ms. Bendavid-Val says, many images and even negatives
were returned to their makers, and what the government did keep was
neither organized nor well cared for.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had plenty of non-governmental photographers,
but the Farm Security Administration, one of the most prominent,
discerning and important photographic employers of the 1930s, was
of, by and for the government. The FSA was established to rally
support for New Deal programs to help farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Stryker, the head of the agency, ordered photographers to
hand over their negatives, and did not return them. (Walker Evans,
unhappy with the arrangement, took two pictures of everything and
sent in only one.) Stryker took complete charge of the photographs
he received, even punching holes in negatives he did not like. He
made great efforts to get these free-of-charge pictures published
and displayed, and he preserved the archive, which is now in the
Library of Congress and making its way onto the Web.
</P>
<P>
   So both governments were engaged in large-scale photographic
projects meant to promote their ideas and programs. The subjects
were sometimes similar _ farmers, children, interiors, daily life,
some industry, some urban environments _ but the press releases for
``Propaganda and Dreams'' _ and on a couple of occasions the show
itself _ mistake this for stylistic similarity.
</P>
<P>
   Both subjects and styles reflect the different histories of the
two nations, something about their different goals, a lot about
their different circumstances in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet work owes a great deal to Rodchenko's experiments in
the creation of a new vision by means of vertiginous views,
close-ups and dislocations. By the 1930s, after Russia and the
Communists had revolutionized art as well as government, the
Soviets forced the art genie back into the bottle, but they never
quite convinced photographers to abandon their discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Many photographers made straightforward documentary pictures of
the approved type, but the esthetically daring, disjunctive style,
replete with bold diagonals and sudden changes of scale, never died
out altogether. Rodchenko was accused of excessive foreign
influence and discredited.
</P>
<P>
   Men like Boris Ignatovich, who continued along related formalist
paths, were not persecuted, merely ignored. Despite the utopianism
of believing that they could change the very way people saw,
despite images that today look very strong, Ignatovich and others
like him seldom got published, yet they did not renounce their
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Modernism in American photography had a wholly different tone
and derivation from most European and Russian modernism: it tended
to be flat, planar, tangentially cubist and constructivist. And
though it was the Soviet administration that decreed an end to
extravagant modernist experiments and a return to a simpler, less
stylized presentation, it was America that accepted the directive
without even being aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The plainspoken approach was valued here as a token of honesty.
American documentary remained stylistically restrained, partly to
distinguish itself from the crowd-pleasing blandishments of
commercial work.
</P>
<P>
   Walker Evans was not alone in the 1930s in centering his
subjects in the middle distance and keeping them strictly parallel
to the picture plane, nor are there many flourishes in the work of
Lange, Russell Lee or Arthur Rothstein. The photographers' very
styles were meant to say: ``We are compassionate but neutral. What
we show you is the unvarnished truth, uncontaminated by the
prejudices of art and personality that creep into magazines like
Life and Look.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Soviet belief in the new man and woman was strengthened
by radical ways of seeing, the American documentary style was a
kind of visual equivalent to the homely, log-cabin character of
Honest Abe.
</P>
<P>
   When the photographs are visually similar, the similarities are
often superficial. Even though the two countries shared a faith in
the potential of government to improve the lot of the citizenry,
even though both believed in the redemptive power of machinery,
even though the photographers were equally convinced that their
imagery could influence social change, the historical differences
were overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.S.R. was at last barreling into the 20th century in the
1930s on tractors and electric lines; the United States had been
industrialized for nearly a century. The Soviet Union was
supposedly at the beginning of a glorious future; the economic
problems of the United States struck many as the end to an entire
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets were fashioning a collective society; Americans
pinned their hopes on the individual. The Soviet pictures are
robust, full of hope, dynamic. The American pictures, supposedly
about the will to overcome, are frequently sad, forlorn, empty and
arid: the image of people who know they are in trouble, as opposed
to the Soviet image of people who are determined to believe they
are not.
</P>
<P>
   Art journals in recent years have repeatedly criticized the FSA
and its photographers for being agents of federal government
propaganda, a criticism that ironically recaps political complaints
about the program by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's opponents in
the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Critics today also accuse the photographers of exploiting their
indigent subjects, an objection that goes to the heart of recent
doubts about documentary practice.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bendavid-Val repeatedly and properly points out that
photographers, editors and publishers in both America and the
Soviet Union believed in the rightness of their cause and the
usefulness and appropriateness of what they were doing. By
definition agents of government propaganda, they were also acting
on their own beliefs, for they shared the political faith in reform
and progress.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Soviets approved of propaganda as education and
understood that the greatest persuasive enterprise in America was
not the FSA but advertising, from which they hoped to learn some
valuable lessons. American critics have further objected to the
FSA's project as a kind of government advertising, which it was,
and it may not seem as benevolent today as it did to photographers
then. But unlike most advertising, it did include critiques of the
American system, particularly of racial segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the 1930s, some American photographers had doubts about
taking advantage of disadvantaged subjects (or at least about other
photographers' doing so), but times were different, and both
photographers and subjects expected that the subjects would benefit
from these pictures. And sometimes they did.
</P>
<P>
   What is astonishing is that Soviet photographers, and Soviet
citizens generally, apparently continued to believe in their cause
in the face of mounting hunger, executions and brutal repression.
Ms. Bendavid-Val writes: ``In the U.S.S.R., citizens went hungry
and endured slave labor to build Soviet industry, witnessed purges
and terror in the name of it, and still they believed they were
better off than the rest of the world, that they belonged to the
world's most prosperous, free and classless society. These
attitudes, bringing into question the very notion of belief,
influenced the course of history.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, one of the great tragedies of this century,
that so many people have suffered in the name of the betterment of
humankind.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre disconnects of the Soviet photo enterprise take on a
different coloration when seen in the light of such beliefs.
Photographers praised collective farming long after Stalin
engineered a famine to kill off thousands upon thousands of farmers
who resisted collectivization.
</P>
<P>
   Rodchenko's first-rate picture essay on the building of the
White Sea Canal, part of which is on view at the Corcoran, in the
pages of that remarkable magazine ``U.S.S.R. in Construction,'' is
a dynamic view of an industrial triumph that cost more than 250,000
lives, a fact that Rodchenko could not have missed.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, he rationalized conscripted labor and death as the
necessary costs of progress, to which his best efforts of
description could also make a contribution. The road to hell is
paved with good intentions, and sometimes with good photographs.

   SERTHAR, China _ Nearly every day, Tibetan monks and nuns
wearing blood-red robes arrive at this distant outpost after a long
trek through a forbidding range of mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by word that a brilliant teacher resides here, they climb
a twisting path up a narrow valley to find a freshly built
metropolis of Buddhist worship. It is a stunning sight in an
otherwise barren setting and a potent symbol of the revival in
Tibetan Buddhism under way here.
</P>
<P>
   A vast assembly of log cabins, spartan inside and out, covers a
pair of steep hillsides. At dusk, crowds of monks and nuns buzz in
conversation, their hair shorn and their gazes serene, as they
gather for evening prayers outside a ramshackle collection of
meeting halls that are connected by a criss-cross of muddy
pathways.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few years, Serthar has emerged to become one of the
largest and most influential centers for the study of Tibetan
Buddhism in the world. Despite its extremely remote location in an
ethnic Tibetan region of Sichuan Province, more than 500 miles by
dirt road from the nearest city, Serthar has attracted nearly 8,000
monks and nuns who now live and study here.
</P>
<P>
   Like countless sects of qigong, traditional meditative and
physical exercises that have enjoyed popularity among Chinese who
believe they can enhance vital energies, Tibetan Buddhism seems to
be filling a spiritual void in the hearts of many adherents. (A new
variant of qigong, Falun Gong, which has attracted a wide
following, was banned on July 22 in a high-profile crackdown.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Serthar is now the brightest star among a number of Tibetan
Buddhist temples that are being built or rebuilt with private
donations from Tibetans and reluctantly accepted by Chinese
authorities. Economic growth has fattened the pockets of some
Tibetans in recent years, and their generosity is funding a gradual
replacement of the thousands of temples that were demolished by
marauding Chinese leftists during the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Tibetans still bristle at the myriad restrictions by Chinese
authorities on religious worship, both in Tibet proper and in the
Tibetan-populated regions in adjoining provinces like this one.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time that Chinese officials take steps to
tighten control over large monasteries that are wellsprings of
political dissent, Serthar is an example of how difficult it is for
Chinese authorities to fully control places of worship where
popular support is surging among the ordinary faithful.
</P>
<P>
   At Serthar, set up as an institute for Buddhist study instead of
as a monastery, the principal magnet is a master teacher, Khenpo
Jikphun, known by followers as a ``living buddha,'' and believed to
be the reincarnation of a holy figure.
</P>
<P>
   Khenpo Jikphun, 66, set up the religious center here in 1980 in
an entirely uninhabited valley. It began in a haphazard way, with a
handful of disciples gathering around the modest home he lived in.
Spreading word slowly attracted more followers, and in recent
years, attendance has surged so fast that there is now a desperate
shortage of living quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Monks and nuns here say they were drawn by their teacher's
reputation as a deeply insightful scholar who is devoted to
reviving a rigorous study of Tibetan Buddhism that was devastated
when monasteries were closed and monks defrocked in political
campaigns directed by Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know our teacher is a great man,'' said Sonam, a
23-year-old nun, who arrived 18 months ago and who, like many
Tibetans, uses only one name. ``He has attained a higher level of
knowledge than anyone in the nation, and what he cares most about
is teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most surprising elements of Serthar is that more than
half of those who come to study are women. Entry is limited at the
relatively small nunneries that exist in areas populated by
Tibetans, but Serthar is open to virtually anyone who is a genuine
student of Khenpo Jikphun's brand of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise at Serthar is that it attracts ethnic Chinese
students as well as Tibetans. Of the nearly 8,000 students here,
roughly 800 are ethnic Chinese, who attend separate classes taught
in Mandarin, while larger classes are taught in Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
   It costs nothing to study here, yet monks and nuns have to find
their own housing. Wooden cabins are going up all over the place,
but not fast enough to handle all the new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone at Serthar seems to credit Khenpo Jikphun's
ingenuity with the spectacular growth here. Khenpo Jikphun
maintains good ties with both Beijing and with the Dalai Lama, in
part by discouraging political discussion and encouraging students
to focus on Buddhist study alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khenpo's revival of the devastated Tibetan Buddhist systems of
educational training has been nothing short of remarkable,'' wrote
David Germano, a Tibet scholar at the University of Virginia, in a
recent essay about Serthar in which he argues that stressing ethics
over political activism is a powerful model for survival in today's
environment.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the intellectual and religious vigor Khenpo Jikphun
brought to Serthar is his mythic, and charismatic presence.
Followers believe he is omniscient and say he was born with the
ability to speak and recite scripture. He even emerged from his
mother's womb, they say, with the placenta wrapped over his
shoulder like a monastic robe.
</P>
<P>
   Khenpo Jikphun claims to be the reincarnation of a holy figure
who taught the previous Dalai Lama, and who died early this
century. Khenpo Jikphun's followers believe it gives him a special
relationship with the current Dalai Lama, whom he visited in India
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to keep up good relations with Chinese authorities, Khenpo
Jikphun participates in an advisory committee in the local
government. He often travels and even visited the United States in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Khenpo Jikphun is extremely popular in the region. Beyond
religious devotees, many ordinary residents in the area display his
photograph next to the Dalai Lama's in stores, homes and even in
the cabs of the hefty cargo trucks that traverse rutted mountain
roads.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Khenpo Jikphun declined a request for an interview. One of his
top lieutenants, Sudaji, said there had never been any serious
political problems at Serthar, and pointed out that Khenpo Jikphun
has never encouraged monks and nuns to come to Serthar but simply
welcomed those who show up.
</P>
<P>
   Several monks here said that authorities in Beijing have
expressed concern about the fast growth of the community at
Serthar, apparently worried about the inherent threat posed by any
organization they do not fully control. Yet suggestions that some
of the new arrivals should be turned away and sent home have
apparently been met by a gentle insistence from Khenpo Jikphun that
it is not his role to police or discourage the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiastic monks and nuns here point to a rigorous curriculum
of Buddhist study that encompasses a large body of texts in diverse
genres that include painting, medicine, history and poetry, as well
as philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they are also inspired by Khenpo Jikphun's personal example
of strict celibacy and ethical norms as the best path to spiritual
revitalization. Although many Tibetan religious leaders have been
seduced by modern comforts, they say, Khenpo Jikphun has
consistently criticized moral lapses among others, which has
created a number of enemies among other Tibetan religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone can learn from our teacher, there will be fewer
problems in the world,'' said Tsering Gyaldyup, a monk who has
studied here for eight years. ``I want to stay here forever,
because there is no better place to be.''

FAMILY COURT FIGHT SHOWS HOW PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS POSE AS
REPORTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Texas, Okla., Colo., Calif., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. _ One of America's wealthiest and most private
families found itself in an unwanted spotlight last summer as its
fractious members waged a bitter courtroom fight over the family
business, Koch Industries, the vast oil and gas company with
headquarters on the prairie at the edge of town here.
</P>
<P>
   But in the corridors and shadows outside the courtroom, another,
more secret battle was taking place, one that reveals a new and
powerful tactic in corporate intrigue. As the jury listened to
evidence, private investigators were infiltrating the press corps
covering the trial in an effort to influence the public's view of
the family struggle and to tip sentiment in favor of its black
sheep, William Koch.
</P>
<P>
   Former news reporters working as investigators on behalf of Koch
(pronounced coke) posed as journalists to try to obtain
confidential information about Koch Industries and to distribute
negative information to legitimate reporters about the company and
Koch's brothers, Charles and David, according to interviews and
documents from the investigative firm that hired them. At least one
newspaper ran a front-page article based in part on the
information.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the Koch case provides an unusually detailed
look at an increasingly common tactic in business disputes: the use
of private detectives. But it also reveals a growing practice
within the detective industry of employing former reporters not
only for their investigative skills but for their willingness to
trade on their past occupation to gain access to sources who would
be unlikely to speak to a private investigator.
</P>
<P>
   And it raises new questions about the seemingly legal, but
ethically questionable, ploys private detectives use to get
information, at a time when there is increasing scrutiny of what is
fast becoming a major American business.
</P>
<P>
   One of Koch's private detectives sought sensitive documents from
a reporter at The Wichita Eagle by claiming he was working on an
article about the Kochs, according to the reporter. Another
detective said he was writing a book and used articles he had
written for several publications to try to obtain interviews with
Koch Industries executives. The documents show he was actually
working on behalf of Koch, who was trying to learn everything he
could about the company run by his brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In a different type of attempt to influence the press, an
investigator said he was offered a $25,000 bonus if he could
persuade a reporter at any national newspaper to publish a negative
article about Koch Industries. The investigator provided
information to a reporter, but he said the bonus had not been paid.
A spokesman for Koch said he had refused the detective's overtures
to place a story for pay.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics surrounding the trial last summer were only the
latest skirmish in a festering dispute between opposing factions of
the Koch family in which private investigators have often been the
mercenaries. Court documents show that detectives working for
William Koch bought trash from the homes of company lawyers and
investigated the family business, while people working for William
said they were followed and harassed by investigators on the Koch
Industries payroll.
</P>
<P>
   These days a majority of the work done by private investigators
involves business disputes. The demands of these corporate clients
have helped to transform the world of private detectives from a
slightly seedy business dominated by ex-cops into a sophisticated,
multibillion-dollar industry with access to the best surveillance
equipment and computer databases. But this growth has collided with
privacy concerns, particularly over deceptions used to obtain
confidential information about individuals and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Colorado grand jury indicted two investigators who
used various subterfuges to gather information on celebrities and
other people. And Congress is considering legislation to make it a
federal crime to obtain financial information from banks by
pretending to be someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Determining how often investigators pose as journalists is
difficult, but what occurred in Wichita clearly was not an isolated
incident. Internet sites, like Espionage Unlimited in Burlington,
Vt., even sell laminated photo cards for $39.95 that identify the
bearer as an employee of a fictitious organization called American
Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, investigators around the country said pretending
to be a journalist was an accepted practice in the industry, one
rarely discovered by subjects of investigations. Those who use it
often justify the pretext as the only means of getting accurate
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all much prefer being who we are, but sometimes you use a
deception because nothing else will produce the truth,'' said Jack
Palladino, a San Francisco private detective who worked for Bill
Clinton in his 1992 campaign. ``You know if you stated honestly to
this person that you were a private investigator, they would lie to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Palladino said he and his wife and partner, Sandra Sutherland,
claim to be journalists on occasion. In a widely publicized example
in the late 1980s, Ms. Sutherland pretended to be a journalist to
get information about a smear campaign against the banker Edmond
Safra orchestrated by American Express.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in May, an investigator for Kroll Associates, the
world's largest investigative firm, was looking into a huge real
estate project in Hong Kong by pretending to be a reporter for a
Seattle publication until he was unmasked after an amateurish
blunder.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator sent an e-mail to David Webb, the editor of
Cyberport, an Internet publication that had criticized the
development. The investigator said he wanted to discuss Webb's view
on the project as part of his research for an article.
Unfortunately for the investigator, he used an e-mail with Kroll's
electronic address, tipping Webb to the subterfuge and leading to
his exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cherkasky, the president of Kroll, confirmed the account
of the incident, which first appeared on Webb's Web site. Cherkasky
declined to identify the investigator, but he said he was fired for
violating Kroll's policy against misrepresentation. Cherkasky said
Kroll had also stopped using an outside investigator whose standard
procedure was to claim to be a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, an investigator for the Investigative Group
International, another big investigative firm, tried to get
information about a candidate for governor of Tennessee by claiming
he was writing a book. When suspicious campaign officials tried to
take his photograph, the investigator thrust his briefcase in front
of his face and fled, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Anthony, the case supervisor at the time, acknowledged
that the investigator, Mike Burns, was working for him. ``They
caught him and he took off running,'' said Anthony, who now works
at another detective agency.
</P>
<P>
   Pretending to be a journalist is not illegal, although several
years ago a Delaware court sanctioned lawyers for allowing Kroll
investigators to pose as reporters and impartial consultants in
questioning former employees of a chemical company.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of former reporters posing as working journalists to
gather information raises broader ethical questions about the use
of ruses and pretexts by private detectives. It also creates
concerns that detectives posing as journalists erode public trust
in the press and jeopardize its independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason people feel confident talking to journalists
is that they believe they are talking to an independent source
representing their interests and the interests of the truth, not to
someone who is part of the police apparatus, whether public or
private,'' said Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation for
Journalism at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many former investigative reporters who work as
private detectives are Larry Gurwin, a former Time magazine
correspondent who is with Control Risks Group; Diana Moneta, a
former reporter and editor at newspapers on Long Island, N.Y., who
is with Investigative Consultants International; John Hanrahan, a
former Washington Post reporter who works for the James B. Mintz
Group; and Kathy Lavinder, a former ABC radio journalist who is at
Investigative Group International.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Pankau, a private investigator who teaches techniques to
journalists and detectives alike, said similar research skills are
required for both jobs. And most former journalists, he said, do
not use their old jobs as cover for investigative work.
</P>
<P>
   In the Koch case, the use of investigators posing as journalists
was described in records from the investigative firm that hired
them. The records, from Decision Strategies International, a large
investigative firm known by the initials DSFX, were sent
unsolicited to The New York Times by an employee. The employee has
since left to work for a competing company and insisted that his
identity be withheld.
</P>
<P>
   DSFX disputed the accuracy of its memorandums in a statement:
``We never engaged in the kind of actions described in this
self-serving and inaccurate document. It is a clear violation of
the company's standards and procedures for any of our employees or
contractors to pose as working journalists in the course of an
investigation. Anyone doing so is in clear violation of our
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hershman, the DSFX chairman, said he could not confirm
that the firm had worked for William Koch because contracts with
clients require confidentiality. Brad Goldstein, a spokesman for
Koch, said the multimillionaire had hired DSFX in the past, but the
spokesman would not specify why and said Koch never authorized
posing as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Hershman said DSFX prohibits its investigators from saying they
work for a specific publication, but he said they could identify
themselves as journalists if they held such jobs in the past and
continue to do some journalism work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are indeed a freelance journalist who also does
private investigation, essentially they are not lying,'' Hershman
said. ``I don't want them to misrepresent, but there is a fine
line. It's a difficult world out there.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no accepted definition of a freelance journalist, just
as there is no way to disprove a former journalist's assertion that
he is thinking about writing an article or book about a particular
subject. Many publications and broadcast outlets rely on part-time
workers who hold other jobs, including as private investigators.
Further muddying the issue, some media organizations, particularly
television, hire private detectives to help with research.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, the impersonation strategy sparked a debate within DSFX.
</P>
<P>
   According to the internal documents, one manager refused to
supervise the investigation because he objected to the subterfuge
on legal and ethical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorandum dated May 22, 1998, the manager, Jim Drinkhall,
wrote, ``This morning, Andy Levetown called to have me manage a
case for Bill Koch where we would have a whole group of reporters
around the country gathering info for us on the Koch Industries
trial, a whistle blower case in Minnesota and an age discrimination
case, in Kansas, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum said that Levetown, a senior manager and lawyer,
saw no problem using reporters and that top management approved the
practice. Elliot Sloane, a spokesman for DSFX, said Levetown could
not discuss the case because of confidentiality restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In a later memorandum, to Bart Schwartz, the DSFX president in
New York, Drinkhall identified two people, Peter Weaver and Michael
Connors, as claiming to be covering the Koch case as journalists
while actually providing information to DSFX. Other unidentified
reporters across the country were being paid to conduct interviews
saying they were writing articles about Koch Industries'
environmental record, ``but are in fact giving us the results of
the interviews,'' the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   Drinkhall, a former investigative reporter for The Wall Street
Journal, declined to discuss the memos because of confidentiality
restrictions. He left DSFX early this year and works for another
investigative firm.
</P>
<P>
   A fuller portrait of the strategy emerged through court records
and interviews with some of the investigators, reporters who
covered the trial and Koch Industries officials. These sources also
made it clear that this was not the first time private detectives
were enmeshed in this nasty family feud.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hire a lot of private eyes because of what we're up
against,'' Goldstein, the spokesman for William Koch, said. ``We're
up against a very secretive company that operates like a cult.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch Industries is the country's second-largest privately held
business behind Cargill, the grain merchant. It operates oil
refineries, gas pipelines and chemical companies and had revenue of
$30 billion last year. But the company maintains a low public
profile and its executives are rarely quoted in the press.
</P>
<P>
   The credit for its growth in the last 20 years has gone largely
to Charles Koch, the eldest of four brothers, who serves as
chairman and lives quietly in Wichita. But the prosperity has
sparked a series of lawsuits by William, the most flamboyant
brother, who is best known for financing the America's Cup victory
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that Charles and another brother, David, cheated him
and other shareholders out of $1 billion when they bought out their
interests in the company in 1983. William has filed at least 10
suits against Koch Industries and family members, including one
against his mother shortly before her death and another that is
scheduled for trial this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, William has hired private detectives to do
everything from investigate claims that Koch Industries was
cheating customers to collect trash outside the homes of company
lawyers. The trash collection was halted after security guards
caught an investigator trying to buy trash from the law firm's
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Court files show that Koch paid $5,000 for two investigators to
collect the trash. Among their expenses were $20 to a garbage truck
driver for bags of trash and $18.73 for rubber gloves and masks.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit, Koch said he hired the investigators to look
for evidence that Koch Industries was spying on him and his
employees. For instance, he said, one of his consultants was
subjected to surveillance and harassment by investigators for Koch
Industries and suggested that documents had been stolen from his
offices. The company has denied both accusations.
</P>
<P>
   It was last summer's trial in Topeka, Kan., that spawned the use
of investigators pretending to be journalists, according to the
DSFX records and interviews with participants in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   What the investigators hoped to gain remains unclear, though
Koch Industries officials would be more likely to share information
with a journalist than a private investigator working for William.
One memo said there were suspicions that company lawyers were
providing reporters with documents protected by a court order.
Also, William complained repeatedly that reporters were biased
against him and he may have thought infiltrating them would prove
his hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   One journalist identified in DSFX records as providing
information to the firm was Peter Weaver, a freelance business
writer in Bethesda, Md., who worked for Forbes magazine many years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to DSFX in January 1998, he sought investigative
work and described using his reputation as a financial reporter to
gain access to corporate insiders for other clients. ``Let's see if
we can come up with a challenging assignment where I can employ my
investigative skills and coveted list of sources to your
advantage,'' he wrote, according to a copy of the letter
distributed to DSFX offices nationwide and obtained by The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said in an interview that he was working on a profile of
William Koch for George magazine and provided an e-mail he sent to
the magazine outlining his story proposal. He said the assignment
was based on speculation that Koch would run for the U.S. Senate
and when he decided not to run it was canceled. DSFX helped him
identify sources for the article, Weaver said, and he later sold
the firm information. He said that he saw no conflict in his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some pay for my interviews and things I was going to use
in my story and I sold it to them,'' he said. ``I did get
something, but it was nothing like I would have gotten for the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Michael Connors, a former Denver Post reporter and part-time
journalist, was hired primarily to see if company lawyers were
leaking confidential material to reporters, according to one DSFX
memo.
</P>
<P>
   Connors attended most of the 11-week trial last summer in
Topeka. Reporters covering the trial, including Leslie Wayne of The
New York Times and Bob Cox of The Wichita Eagle, said he told them
he was writing a book about the Kochs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connors showed up at the trial and said he wanted to write a
book,'' said Cox, now at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. ``I had
lunch with him a couple times and kept asking who his publisher was
and he was pretty evasive.''
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, Connors wrote to Koch Industries requesting
interviews with executives. He enclosed copies of some of his
articles, including one for Time magazine, according to a copy of
the letter provided by Koch Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Connors said in an interview that he works as a private
investigator and freelance writer, but insisted that he attended
the trial only as a journalist. He said the book is on hold and
declined to identify the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a journalist and I am an investigator,'' he said. ``I do
both, but never at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   A Web site run by a Dallas private investigation firm identifies
Connors as an employee. Jack Taylor Jr., a former reporter who is
now a licensed private detective, runs the firm. Though Taylor's
name does not appear in the DSFX memos, two people involved in the
Koch investigation said he also worked for DSFX as a subcontractor.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said in an interview that his involvement in the Koch
matter was as a journalist and declined to say whether he worked
for Koch or DSFX. ``Texas law prohibits a private investigator from
revealing anything at all about a client or work done on behalf of
a client without the client's permission, even in a court of law,''
he said. (Goldstein said Koch would not grant permission for
investigators to discuss work they may have done for him.)
</P>
<P>
   Reporters covering the Koch case said Taylor told them he was
working on a long article about the family. Cox, the former Wichita
reporter, said Taylor contacted him before the Koch trial, saying
he was considering writing an article and asking for sensitive Koch
Industries documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started quizzing me about various people and he wanted to
see a document that had been leaked to us that had been prepared by
Koch Industries purporting to expose Bill's record as an
employee,'' Cox said. ``Jack really wanted to get his hands on that
document.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is well known in investigative reporting circles, having
worked at The Daily Oklahoman, The Dallas Times Herald and The Los
Angeles Daily News. Cox said he knew him as a reporter and member
of Investigative Reporters &AMP; Editors, an organization for
journalists and educators. Still, he declined to give him the
document.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, the Topeka jury decided in favor of Koch
Industries, but another trial was set for this year in Tulsa,
Okla., and William was still interested in pillorying the company.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, Taylor sent packages of negative information about
the company, including videotape spliced together from depositions
for the upcoming trial, to at least 10 reporters in Kansas,
Oklahoma and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A business card attached to the package identified Taylor as a
journalist, and in a memo he wrote that he discovered the
information while working as a freelance writer for someone who was
concerned about the environment. He suggested that the reporters
might be interested in the material.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said in the interview that he did not distribute the
material as a private investigator, but he still declined to say
who paid him. ``I did it as a journalist and was paid as a
journalist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A search of newspapers in the region turned up one article based
on the material, in Indian Country Today, America's largest Indian
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor acknowledged sending the information to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The search could not determine whether other coverage of Koch
Industries was affected by the information. However, officials at
Koch Industries said they suspect other negative articles were
based on the information.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to influence the press another way, a private
detective in Washington working for DSFX provided much of the same
information to a reporter at The Wall Street Journal, according to
the detective, who spoke on condition that his name be withheld
because of his confidentiality agreement. He said he expected a
$25,000 fee if he succeeded in persuading the reporter to write a
negative article.
</P>
<P>
   The detective identified the reporter as John Fialka, an
investigative reporter in the Journal's Washington bureau. Fialka
acknowledged that he was friends with the detective and that they
had discussed Koch Industries briefly, but he declined to describe
the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't discuss projects that we're working on, especially to
The New York Times,'' Fialka said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, the spokesman for William Koch, said a private
investigator had sought a fee for placing a negative story, but
Koch rejected the offer. ``If you're saying Bill has a bounty
system for stories, you're wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Rosser, director of communications at Koch Industries, said
Fialka has been working on an article about the company since last
spring.

<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. _ One of America's wealthiest and most private
families found itself in an unwanted spotlight last summer as its
fractious members waged a bitter courtroom fight over the family
business, Koch Industries, the vast oil and gas company with
headquarters on the prairie at the edge of town here.
</P>
<P>
   But in the corridors and shadows outside the courtroom, another,
more secret battle was taking place, one that reveals a new and
powerful tactic in corporate intrigue. As the jury listened to
evidence, private investigators were infiltrating the press corps
covering the trial in an effort to influence the public's view of
the family struggle and to tip sentiment in favor of its black
sheep, William Koch.
</P>
<P>
   Former news reporters working as investigators on behalf of Koch
(pronounced coke) posed as journalists to try to obtain
confidential information about Koch Industries and to distribute
negative information to legitimate reporters about the company and
Koch's brothers, Charles and David, according to interviews and
documents from the investigative firm that hired them. At least one
newspaper ran a front-page article based in part on the
information.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the Koch case provides an unusually detailed
look at an increasingly common tactic in business disputes: the use
of private detectives. But it also reveals a growing practice
within the detective industry of employing former reporters not
only for their investigative skills but for their willingness to
trade on their past occupation to gain access to sources who would
be unlikely to speak to a private investigator.
</P>
<P>
   And it raises new questions about the seemingly legal, but
ethically questionable, ploys private detectives use to get
information, at a time when there is increasing scrutiny of what is
fast becoming a major American business.
</P>
<P>
   One of Koch's private detectives sought sensitive documents from
a reporter at The Wichita Eagle by claiming he was working on an
article about the Kochs, according to the reporter. Another
detective said he was writing a book and used articles he had
written for several publications to try to obtain interviews with
Koch Industries executives. The documents show he was actually
working on behalf of Koch, who was trying to learn everything he
could about the company run by his brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics surrounding the trial last summer were only the
latest skirmish in a festering dispute between opposing factions of
the Koch family in which private investigators have often been the
mercenaries. Court documents show that detectives working for
William Koch bought trash from the homes of company lawyers and
investigated the family business, while people working for William
said they were followed and harassed by investigators on the Koch
Industries payroll.
</P>
<P>
   These days a majority of the work done by private investigators
involves business disputes. The demands of these corporate clients
have helped to transform the world of private detectives from a
slightly seedy business dominated by ex-cops into a sophisticated,
multibillion-dollar industry with access to the best surveillance
equipment and computer databases. But this growth has collided with
privacy concerns, particularly over deceptions used to obtain
confidential information about individuals and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Colorado grand jury indicted two investigators who
used various subterfuges to gather information on celebrities and
other people. And Congress is considering legislation to make it a
federal crime to obtain financial information from banks by
pretending to be someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Determining how often investigators pose as journalists is
difficult, but what occurred in Wichita clearly was not an isolated
incident. Internet sites, like Espionage Unlimited in Burlington,
Vt., even sell laminated photo cards for $39.95 that identify the
bearer as an employee of a fictitious organization called American
Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, investigators around the country said pretending
to be a journalist was an accepted practice in the industry, one
rarely discovered by subjects of investigations. Those who use it
often justify the pretext as the only means of getting accurate
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all much prefer being who we are, but sometimes you use a
deception because nothing else will produce the truth,'' said Jack
Palladino, a San Francisco private detective who worked for Bill
Clinton in his 1992 campaign. ``You know if you stated honestly to
this person that you were a private investigator, they would lie to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Palladino said he and his wife and partner, Sandra Sutherland,
claim to be journalists on occasion. In a widely publicized example
in the late 1980s, Ms. Sutherland pretended to be a journalist to
get information about a smear campaign against the banker Edmond
Safra orchestrated by American Express.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in May, an investigator for Kroll Associates, the
world's largest investigative firm, was looking into a huge real
estate project in Hong Kong by pretending to be a reporter for a
Seattle publication until he was unmasked after an amateurish
blunder.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator sent an e-mail to David Webb, the editor of
Cyberport, an Internet publication that had criticized the
development. The investigator said he wanted to discuss Webb's view
on the project as part of his research for an article.
Unfortunately for the investigator, he used an e-mail with Kroll's
electronic address, tipping Webb to the subterfuge and leading to
his exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cherkasky, the president of Kroll, confirmed the account
of the incident, which first appeared on Webb's Web site. Cherkasky
declined to identify the investigator, but he said he was fired for
violating Kroll's policy against misrepresentation. Cherkasky said
Kroll had also stopped using an outside investigator whose standard
procedure was to claim to be a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, an investigator for the Investigative Group
International, another big investigative firm, tried to get
information about a candidate for governor of Tennessee by claiming
he was writing a book. When suspicious campaign officials tried to
take his photograph, the investigator thrust his briefcase in front
of his face and fled, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Anthony, the case supervisor at the time, acknowledged
that the investigator, Mike Burns, was working for him. ``They
caught him and he took off running,'' said Anthony, who now works
at another detective agency.
</P>
<P>
   Pretending to be a journalist is not illegal, although several
years ago a Delaware court sanctioned lawyers for allowing Kroll
investigators to pose as reporters and impartial consultants in
questioning former employees of a chemical company.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of former reporters posing as working journalists to
gather information raises broader ethical questions about the use
of ruses and pretexts by private detectives. It also creates
concerns that detectives posing as journalists erode public trust
in the press and jeopardize its independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason people feel confident talking to journalists
is that they believe they are talking to an independent source
representing their interests and the interests of the truth, not to
someone who is part of the police apparatus, whether public or
private,'' said Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation for
Journalism at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Pankau, a private investigator who teaches techniques to
journalists and detectives alike, said similar research skills are
required for both jobs. And most former journalists, he said, do
not use their old jobs as cover for investigative work.
</P>
<P>
   In the Koch case, the use of investigators posing as journalists
was described in records from the investigative firm that hired
them. The records, from Decision Strategies International, a large
investigative firm known by the initials DSFX, were sent
unsolicited to The New York Times by an employee. The employee has
since left to work for a competing company and insisted that his
identity be withheld.
</P>
<P>
   DSFX disputed the accuracy of its memorandums in a statement:
``We never engaged in the kind of actions described in this
self-serving and inaccurate document. It is a clear violation of
the company's standards and procedures for any of our employees or
contractors to pose as working journalists in the course of an
investigation. Anyone doing so is in clear violation of our
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hershman, the DSFX chairman, said he could not confirm
that the firm had worked for William Koch because contracts with
clients require confidentiality. Brad Goldstein, a spokesman for
Koch, said the multimillionaire had hired DSFX in the past, but the
spokesman would not specify why and said Koch never authorized
posing as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Hershman said DSFX prohibits its investigators from saying they
work for a specific publication, but he said they could identify
themselves as journalists if they held such jobs in the past and
continue to do some journalism work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are indeed a freelance journalist who also does
private investigation, essentially they are not lying,'' Hershman
said. ``I don't want them to misrepresent, but there is a fine
line. It's a difficult world out there.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no accepted definition of a freelance journalist, just
as there is no way to disprove a former journalist's assertion that
he is thinking about writing an article or book about a particular
subject. Many publications and broadcast outlets rely on part-time
workers who hold other jobs, including as private investigators.
Further muddying the issue, some media organizations, particularly
television, hire private detectives to help with research.

HOUSE BACKS CLINTON DECISION TO CONTINUE TRADE TIES WITH CHINA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted to continue normal trade ties with
China on Tuesday, turning aside concerns that Beijing may have
stolen top secret U.S. nuclear and missile technology and has
intensified persecution of its citizens for their political and
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The approval extending normal trade relations, or NTR, for at
least another year came on a vote of 260-170 after several hours of
debate. Opponents called on Congress to ``wise up'' before rubber
stamping a policy they described as ``anti-American and a threat to
our national security.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote margin on extending NTR, which gives the same low
tariffs to China that most other U.S. trading partners enjoy, was
nearly the same as it was last year in the House, despite the
suspicions of spying and evidence that Beijing's human rights
abuses have continued unabated.
</P>
<P>
   Characterizing the charges that China may have stolen secret
material from a U.S. nuclear weapons lab in New Mexico as ``a
nightmare'' for the nation, Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, and other
opponents also cited the more than $60 billion trade deficit with
China as evidence that the United States is continuing to lose out
economically in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is spying and buying our nation right out from under
us,'' Traficant declared at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, however, were quick to counter that ending normal
trade ties would cost U.S. jobs and could provoke a trade war that
would give an advantage to competitors interested more in expanding
their own foothold in the Asia market than worrying about China's
human rights' record.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, who helped
lead the effort to win renewal of China's NTR status, cautioned his
colleagues about the fragility of the U.S.-Sino relationship in the
wake of the espionage charges and the recent NATO bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, R-Texas, contended that ending normal trade ties would
result in ``far greater consequences for America, for China and for
the entire world'' than the problems that exist now.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration agreed with Archer's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, President Clinton said that yanking China's NTR
status would undermine America's ability to influence over time ``a
fifth of the world's population'' in hopes of initiating greater
democratic reforms in China.
</P>
<P>
   Congress was required to vote on the annual trade status renewal
for China under a 1974 law that gives the president authority to
extend normal trade ties to totalitarian states on an annual basis
if they meet certain guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton issued his decision June 3 to grant another year's
extension of NTR, which was formerly called most-favored-nation
trade status, saying he was certain that the U.S. policy of
engagement with China _ the Bush and Reagan administrations
followed the same policy _ was best for America's economic and
security interests.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement after the vote Tuesday, Clinton said the renewed
trade status would promote ``China's integration into the global
economy,'' which would in turn strengthen market-oriented reformers
within China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expanding trade can help bring greater social change to China
by spreading the tools, contacts and ideas that promote freedom,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has voted every year since 1980 to sanction the
president's decision to grant the extension. Opponents, however,
had hoped that this year would be different, given the reports that
China may have stolen secret material from the Los Alamos facility
in New Mexico and may have tried to influence the outcome of recent
U.S. national elections with illegal campaign contributions.
Opponents had hoped that recent threats from Beijing directed at
Taiwan would also influence the vote outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The vote split the parties with Republicans and Democrats voting
on both sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All 17 Democrats in the Texas delegation and 11 of the 13
Republicans voted for continuing normal trade ties. Reps. Joe
Barton, of Ennis, and Lamar Smith, of San Antonio, were the only
two Republicans in the delegation to vote against it.
</P>
<P>
   The Texans who voted in favor of the extension insisted that
their support should not be construed as an approval of China's
policies or of the U.S. policy of engagement at the expense of
other important interests.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, for instance, called on the
administration and Congress to rethink its approach to dealing with
China. Casting what she described as a ``reluctant'' vote to
continue NTR for China, she said the U.S. policy toward China ``has
been wrong and it's time for the United States to get some guts and
gumption and do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, said his vote was driven by concerns
that ending trade ties with China would cost U.S. jobs and give
U.S. competitors who ``are not as sympathetic on human rights as we
are'' a chance to widen their hold on the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston, agreed, noting that a vote against
China would amount to ``a vote against the American worker.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The debate also drew lobbyists, labor organizations and
conservative groups, such as the Family Research Council, to
Capitol Hill on Tuesday to condemn the policy of normal trade
relations. Business groups backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
meanwhile, sought its continuation, noting that 200,000 jobs and
about $18 billion in annual U.S. exports are dependent on trade
with China.
</P>
<P>
   Trade and business groups warned that revoking normal trade
status for China would kill efforts to conclude talks aimed at
making China a member of the World Trade Organization. The
administration has argued that China's inclusion in the WTO would
open its markets to major U.S. industrial and agricultural exports.
</P>
<P>
   The talks have bogged down since the accidental NATO bombing of
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   While recognizing the importance of trade with China, opponents
still sought to turn the vote into a referendum on China's human
rights record, which they insisted has only worsened since the
Tiananmen Square massacre 10 years ago. They pointed to the recent
crackdown in China on the Falun Gong religious sect to make their
point.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate Tuesday, about 90 or so followers of Falun
Gong sat quietly in meditation on the Capitol building grounds to
protest the ongoing arrests of sect members in China and to remind
lawmakers of the continued human rights abuses there.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any measure conceivable ... this is an abysmal record. Ten
years (after Tiananmen) is long enough to see that things haven't
changed. In fact things have gotten worse,'' said House Minority
Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., who joined with 97 other Democrats and
71 Republicans to vote against NTR for China.

HARD WORK, THE VIRTUE OF A FESTIVAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's no use either admiring or picking apart Lincoln
Center Festival '99. Management had co-designers imposed on it,
Shanghai bureaucracy and Lady Luck among them.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute cancellation of ``The Peony Pavilion'' in 1998
left a hole in the center of the event a year ago. The
resuscitation of this 19-hour Ming Dynasty classic in 1999 was
welcomed by nearly everyone, but it certainly altered any theme
Lincoln Center might originally have had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Do themes matter? ``Balanced opposition'' might be the better
term. The Salzburg Festival this year runs from Rameau to Berio,
with heavy hitters from the Romantic and post-Romantic eras in
between. Busoni's ``Doktor Faust'' and Berlioz's ``Damnation of
Faust'' line up by definition, but don't tie yourself in knots
making intellectual links between Rameau's ``Boreades'' and Berg's
``Lulu.'' Savor instead the balance of styles and the quality of
the productions.
</P>
<P>
   At Lincoln Center, ``The Peony Pavilion'' and John Eliot
Gardiner's four-concert, period-instrument survey of Schumann
shared the rarefied air of historical investigation, but here
again, significance should tread lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner's chatty style, amiable demonstrations and good
musicians seem to have had their fans. And if the Steve Reich
series was largely a retrospective of pieces we already knew, their
ability to draw young audiences made everyone grateful. Crowds at
Alice Tully Hall indicated an audience hungry for new slants on old
repertory.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Philharmonic's performances of the Beethoven piano
concertos had little to do with any kind of festival: a tired,
make-work kind of enterprise, repeating the obvious. What an
opportunity squandered: Emanuel Ax, one of the world's important
pianists, shows great curiosity about new repertory; this orchestra
can do anything that brave and imaginative leadership asks it to.
The Philharmonic's participation seemed more like business than
art; such policies undermine a young festival looking hard for an
image.
</P>
<P>
   Thematic symmetry had a chance here recently with the opera that
almost was, Messiaen's ``St. Francois d'Assise'' in Peter Sellars'
Salzburg production. If finances and logistics had allowed, New
York would have been in for a treat, and rumor has it that it might
still be: a deeply Christian opera at the center of contemporary
religious pieces in all shapes and sizes. What a time we would have
had with Stravinsky, Ligeti, Debussy and Arvo Part. How well this
year's gospel marathon, House Full o' Praise, would have fit.
</P>
<P>
   Festivals, as they have come down from the Greeks, take
audiences and performers from urban settings and ask their spirits
to chew on important matters, dispensed in intensive doses.
Festivals in the old sense have something in common with the
business or religious retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Refreshment and relative freedom from distraction are promised.
People examine themselves and those around them in simpler
surroundings. New York in summer is presumably what the classic
festivalgoer is trying to get away from.
</P>
<P>
   So either Lincoln Center is violating the spirit of the festival
and should be ashamed of itself, or it is saying that it will have
any kind of festival it pleases, and that it will define the word
according to its own needs.
</P>
<P>
   It shares one thing in common with its colleagues around the
world, and that is a sense of place. The festival at
Aix-en-Provence in the south of France is as much about the
charming and secluded outdoor spaces as about what goes on inside
them. The complex of theaters in Salzburg, including one carved out
of rock, becomes a destination in itself.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Center is a collection of theaters as well. They sit on
common ground while going in different directions, and sometimes
need to prove that they are all of a piece. They are also very
large for the night-after-night festival audience, which thrives on
intimacy and a gradually growing mutual acquaintanceship.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Tully Hall, just over 1,000 seats and host to Gardiner's
Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique, has been serviceable in
this respect. The La Guardia Concert Hall, down the street and
holding just under 1,000, has been a pleasant find. ``Peony
Pavilion'' audiences, which ranged from satisfactory to sold out
over the many performances and repeated cycles, would have been
lost in the New York State Theater.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lincoln Center Festival needs an identifying theme, I
nominate the concept of hard work. ``The Peony Pavilion'' may be a
marathon of delight, but it is a marathon nonetheless. Stamina and
loyalty go along with the price of admission: six visits to one
event to absorb a culture a lot of us Westerners will never fully
grasp anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the labor in question was ``Palestrina,''
Pfitzner's four-and-a-half-hour exercise in operatic gluttony.
Comforted by the testimony of experts, I went to ``Palestrina''
with high hopes and a pair of comfortable shoes. Most of Act I was
revealing, the rest _ well, hard work. New York ticket buyers voted
with their feet on that one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet trial by ordeal may have a particular resonance for a New
York festival, and here I offer another overarching theme: art
imitating life. We all ride the subway, brave the bouts of heat and
humidity, fend off the noise and, at the end of the day,
congratulate ourselves on being able to live in this city. Being
happy in New York is hard work, and maybe ``The Peony Pavilion''
and ``Palestrina'' underline that fact.

FIRST LADY PROMOTES CAMPAIGN ISSUES IN WHIRLWIND DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton capitalized on
her White House role Tuesday to showcase support for women, the
poor and Jewish voters _ all potentially important constituencies
in her possible Senate campaign from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady staged four public appearances across the
nation's capital in barely 10 hours, setting the stage for
resumption of her summer-long, campaign-style ``listening tour''
across New York on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Washington whirlwind also appeared designed in part to
steal some of the thunder from her most likely Republican rival for
the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has criticized the first
lady for being an Illinois-born, Arkansas-based carpetbagger
candidate in New York, traveled to the Clintons' turf in Arkansas
Tuesday to highlight his criticisms and raise money for his own
burgeoning Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With no additional public events on her schedule before she
leaves for New York on Thursday, the first lady's rapid-fire
appearances here marked the end of a self-imposed moratorium on
campaign activities following the death of and memorial services
for John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her
sister, Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to return to the Empire State Thursday for a third
campaign-related foray since creating a campaign fund-raising
committee on July 6. She plans visits to Elmira, Bath and Ithaca
before returning to Washington on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, appearing twice with President Clinton at the
White House, struck the partisan themes of a prospective Senate
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   She challenged the Republican leadership in Congress to enact
the Clinton administration's proposed overhaul of Medicare, saying
changes are needed to provide better health care to elderly women
who make up 60 percent of the nearly 40 million people on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Later, during an East Room appearance to celebrate the 25th
anniversary of the Legal Services Corp., Clinton warned that ``we
again face a challenge from those in Congress who are working to
slash'' a $300 million-a-year federal program that recruits 150,000
volunteer lawyers nationwide to provide representation for civil
suits by the poor, regardless of ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, noting that nearly half the 40 million Americans in
poverty are children, said expanded efforts are needed to make sure
that the poor have legal representation to obtain child support,
health care for children, adequate housing, nursing home care and
protection from physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Without the help of Legal Services Corp.'s 258 legal aid
programs across the country, ``many of those children and their
parents would have no place to turn,'' said Clinton, who served as
chairwoman of the organization from 1978 to 1980 while her husband
was governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the first lady:
</P>
<P>
   _ Presided over the National Jewish Democratic Council's
presentation of a humanitarian award to honor former Democratic
Party Chairman Steve Grossman and his wife Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   _ Received the Henrietta Szold Humanitarian Award from the
87-year-old Hadassah Jewish women's organization for her efforts on
behalf of issues ``critical to women and families.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stepped up her campaign-related activities a day after
the release of a Zogby New York poll of 709 likely voters in the
state showing the first lady continuing to trail Giuliani in a
hypothetical Senate contest.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, completed on July 19 and released Monday, showed
Giuliani leading Clinton 49 percent to 39 percent overall in a
general election contest. Giuliani's 10 percentage point edge was
double his advantage in a Zogby survey completed in May.
</P>
<P>
   But the same survey underscored Clinton's intent to appeal to
women, who favored the first lady over Giuliani 44 percent to 42
percent, according to the Zogby survey.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks about Medicare, Clinton said elderly women stand
to benefit the most from the administration's efforts to ``save and
modernize Medicare.'' These women, she said, ``struggle to pay for
out-patient prescription drugs'' and ``skip regular screenings and
check-ups that would enhance the quality of their lives and reduce
Medicare's long-term costs,'' the first lady said.

   The Clintons will spend nine days on the Massachusetts vacation
island of Cape Cod, beginning Aug. 19, followed by seven days in
New York state _ a two-day weekend in posh East Hampton, N.Y., on

GOING DOWN TO THE `DEEP BLUE SEA' _ FOR SOME UNINTENDED LAUGHS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What this summer has been missing at the movies is a
preposterous action tale. No, ``Wild Wild West'' doesn't count.
We're talking about something even more absurd, something that
pummels you with its total disregard for actors, dialogue, subtlety
or common sense. Something along the lines of a ``Rock,'' a ``Con
Air'' or an ``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Renny Harlin, who gave us ``Die Hard 2'' and
``Cliffhanger,'' to fill the void. In his latest, the shark-vs.-man
fish story ``Deep Blue Sea,'' the director actually stages an
action sequence that manages to incorporate all the elements:
earth, wind, fire and water. Never let it be said that Harlin
leaves anything out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sea'' is bizarrely entertaining, perhaps even in ways that
Harlin meant it to be, even though it's really not very good. If
you've seen its ads with a huge shark creeping up behind a woman in
the drink, you might think it's a ``Jaws'' rip-off, but you'd be
wrong. It's actually a rip-off of ``Jaws'' and just about every
disaster movie since ``Jaws.'' At one point, Harlin even steals
from himself, in a sequence that echoes the opening of
``Cliffhanger,'' perhaps the finest eight minutes Harlin has ever
directed. He didn't know when to quit in that movie, though, and
that's a problem he has in ``Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   You might also think that we've had one ``Jaws'' imitator this
summer in ``Lake Placid,'' so why do we need two? But ``Sea'' is
better than ``Lake'' _ well, at least it's more fun simply because
the forced ironic tone of ``Lake'' isn't as funny as the
unintentional humor in ``Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? Can you really make a movie this ridiculous without
knowing it? A movie that gives us a gee-whiz Samuel L. Jackson who
turns into Evangelical ``Pulp Fiction'' Man when he loses his
glasses as things turn grim? A movie that asks us to buy willowy
Saffron Burrows, who apparently believes that constant frowning
gives her an air of authority, as a scientist whose obsessive
Alzheimer's research leads to the development of some hypersmart,
voracious supersharks?
</P>
<P>
   A movie that makes you wonder if Thomas Jane, who looks like a
cross between Matthew McConaughey and Brad Pitt, was cast as a
Zen-like ``shark wrangler'' because McConaughey and Pitt choked on
their laughter when the part was offered? A movie that gives us LL
Cool J as a chef nicknamed Preacher, who in all fairness gets the
most exciting one-on-one encounter with a shark? A movie whose
effects are so cheesy that when the sharks chomp on humans, they
look like they're chowing down on punctured party balloons?
</P>
<P>
   Not that the actors matter. The real star is Harlin, whose
excessiveness has a what'll-he-do-next quality, as if you'd
unleashed Beavis and Butt-head in a fireworks factory. It's fun to
watch for a while, but eventually you realize it's just a bunch of
noise, as Harlin's cameras swoop, spin, dive and swim, and he and
the trio of screenwriters layer calamity upon calamity.
</P>
<P>
   Harlin revels in it all, as if he can't believe that someone
actually gave him money to make a movie after the megaflop
``Cutthroat Island.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the plot? If you care about the plot, this isn't the
movie for you. If you want to watch a director run amok, though,
it's enough to qualify as a guilty pleasure. It probably won't make
you afraid to go back in the water, but it'll probably make you
afraid to see another movie with water in it.

GIULIANI VISITS LIKELY SENATE OPPONENT'S ONE-TIME HOME TURF

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani stood on the
porch of Hillary Rodham Clinton's former home here Tuesday morning,
proclaimed his admiration for the people of Arkansas and said that
he was visiting ``to get a sense of how united the Republican Party
really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his brief swing through Little Rock was also a
swipe at Mrs. Clinton, his likely opponent in the U.S. Senate race
next year, Giuliani said, ``It's not in my personality to do
anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He then announced that he would fly the Arkansas flag over City
Hall for a few days, to thank Gov. Mike Huckabee and his other
Republican hosts for their hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put up a big Arkansas flag at City Hall,''
Giuliani told a swarm of 60 reporters, photographers and television
crew members from around the nation, who were trying to record his
visit to the Governor's Mansion without expiring in the 91-degree
heat. ``We'll fly it for a couple of days, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Huckabee and his wife, Janet, and touring the
first floor of the Governor's Mansion, Giuliani proceeded to a
fund-raising lunch at the Capital Hotel, where 62 people paid $500
each for filet mignon and a 15-minute speech in which the mayor
boasted of his success as a Republican in a largely Democratic
city. The lunch raised about $40,000 for Giuliani's political
committee, and his aides predicted that he would pull in at least
$90,000 more at fund-raising events in New Orleans Tuesday night
and in Alabama on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But while the two-day trip was billed as a fund-raising tour of
the South, Giuliani's six hours in Little Rock Tuesday seemed more
like a traveling circus, or at least a movie shoot. Local camera
crews shot footage of out-of-town camera crews. Out-of town
reporters interviewed local reporters. And Giuliani's press
secretary, Sunny Mindel, gleefully snapped pictures of them all.
Waiters served pink lemonade and chocolate cookies under a magnolia
tree at the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   And just outside the fancy iron gates _ near a bust of a smiling
Bill Clinton _ a group of women who called themselves The Vast
Right Wing Conspiracy waved signs shaped like hogs that read,
``Razorbacks for Rudy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so tired of Bill and Hillary's scandals and we think
Rudy has done a good job,'' said Jamie Simmons, who said she and
the other sign-wavers had traveled from Memphis, Tenn., to catch a
glimpse of Giuliani. ``We are probably more conservative than he
is, but if it's between him and her, he is the man for the job.''

TASK FORCE HEARS PROPOSAL TO CUT DRUG PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Boston researcher presented a proposal to a congressional task
force Tuesday that calls for government intervention in bringing US
pharmaceutical prices down to a level comparable to those in other
developed countries. US prices are among the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 70 million people, or a quarter of the US
population, have no prescription drug coverage, according to Alan
Sager, a Boston University School of Public Health professor, who
presented a report Tuesday before the House Prescription Drug Task
Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a great crisis is unfolding here,'' said Sager. For
those without insurance to cover prescription drugs, he said, ``The
crisis is already upon them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Sager and BU colleague Deborah Socolar compare US
drug prices to those in other developed nations, such as Canada and
Australia, and found that wholesale prices here are 25 percent to
68 percent higher than prices paid elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Total US expenditures for prescription drugs will reach an
estimated $120 billion this year, making it the
second-most-expensive part of the nation's health care budget,
behind physician services and ahead of hospital care, according to
Sager.
</P>
<P>
   But if the United States were able to negotiate prices down to
the level paid by Canadians, for example, US residents would save
about $16.2 billion this year, or 13.5 percent, according to the
report. That would provide enough savings to provide all US
residents with the medications they need, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Some government agencies in the United States, such as Medicaid
and some state public health departments, already negotiate lower
drug prices. Legislative efforts are underway in Massachusetts and
Vermont to give state government the ability to negotiate drug
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bills have been filed in Congress, including one that calls for
international parity on drug prices, and another that would allow
pharmacies to buy drugs at low prices for Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the federal program for the elderly and disabled, does
not cover prescription drugs, although beneficiaries can buy
supplemental insurance for medication needs.
</P>
<P>
   Sager said the report does not propose or support specific
legislation. ``We're trying to identify some principles that good
legislation should follow. There is a lot of good in many of the
bills,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackie Cottrell, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, said any effort at
a government mandate or price control will hurt research and,
ultimately, patients. Instead, the industry group supports Medicare
changes so that prescription drugs are covered for the elderly and
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ways to expand drug coverage without harming the
industry and innovation,'' said Cottrell, who cited other recent
reports, including one done for PhRMA by a Brandeis University
researcher, which found that price controls would stymie the
development of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Cottrell pointed out that the Clinton administration opposes
price controls.

AT&AMP;T WINS ROUND IN CABLE FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Caught in the middle of a high-stakes cyberspace
turf war, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors has granted AT&AMP;T a
monopoly on high-speed Internet access over its cable lines for
now.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Monday means that AT&AMP;T, along with its subsidiary
Excite &LR; Home, will not be forced to share its cable lines with its
competitors in San Francisco for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   The city may wait, for example, until legal battles in Oregon
and Florida over the same access issues are resolved. The board
requested a status report for Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The move came on a 9-2 vote to transfer control of the city's
cable system to AT&AMP;T, which bought cable franchise operator TCI.
</P>
<P>
   With the transfer, the city could have forced AT&AMP;T and
Excite &LR; Home to share its cable lines with America Online, GTE,
Pacific Bell and other competitors. Those companies want the chance
to give their customers access to the Internet over high-speed
cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   But after fierce lobbying from both sides, the board decided to
put off compelling AT&AMP;T to open its lines.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the decision would allow the city to avoid a
protracted legal battle with AT&AMP;T and would ensure that the new
cable operator would rebuild the aging system to state-of-the-art
standards at a cost of $50 million over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed with the board's action, supporters of open access
have vowed to go to the voters to overturn the decision by
referendum next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano and Supervisor Leland
Yee voted against the franchise agreement, which addressed both the
transfer and the open access issue.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was preceded by one of the most intense and pricey
lobbying campaigns ever to hit City Hall. Estimates put the effort
at more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors were inundated with thousands of electronic mail
messages, faxes and phone calls from both sides.
Corporate-sponsored advocacy groups aired TV commercials, operated
sophisticated phone banks and took out full-page newspaper ads.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's meeting, open access supporters and opponents came
out in force. Many of them had direct financial links to the
companies that had something at stake. ``Support open access''
baseball caps were handed out by one side, candy by the other.
</P>
<P>
   Both carried the same message: The consumer will benefit. What
wasn't addressed directly Monday were the financial stakes for AT&AMP;T
and the other affected Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the Internet depends on the availability of
high-speed access. Cable lines aren't the only way to achieve it.
Digital and satellite systems are also competing in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Both Portland, Ore., and Broward County, Fla., have already
moved to impose open access requirements on AT&AMP;T's cable lines, and
the company is fighting back in court.
</P>
<P>
   But San Francisco has become ground zero in the battle among
Internet titans. The thinking has been that as goes San Francisco _
one of the country's key technology hubs _ so will go the rest of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Friedlander, acting director of San Francisco's
Telecommunications and Information Services Department, noted that
the debate over open access was merely hypothetical now because the
existing cable system couldn't handle the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   The legal cases in Portland and Broward County could have a
bearing on what happens here.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T sued when Portland required it to open access to its
Internet competitors; the city has won the first legal round. And
Monday AT&AMP;T filed a federal lawsuit against Broward County to try
to overturn its open-access ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   If AT&AMP;T loses its court battles against the other jurisdictions,
San Francisco supervisors have reserved the right to seek open
access requirements in the city. They also said they could push for
open access under any other legal power granted to them.
</P>
<P>
   However, they chose not to write the law approved Monday so that
open access in San Francisco would be triggered automatically if
Portland eventually prevails or the federal or state governments
give the green light. The transfer agreement simply says San
Francisco ``may impose'' open access.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano had wanted an open access requirement to kick in
immediately. When that failed, he tried to hinge open access here
to the outcome of the Portland case.
</P>
<P>
   He called the legislation adopted by the board Monday little
more than ``hocus-pocus and hooey'' because it gives the city
leeway in deciding later whether to take on AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make AT&AMP;T do anything,'' he said.

   BUKAVU, Congo _ Kahuzi-Biega National Park is where Dian Fossey
first saw wild gorillas. It is the first park to allow tourists to
get near them, for a price that enriched local people. Bill Gates
visited there in 1993, and he tipped his guide $400.
</P>
<P>
   Now the park, in the jungles of eastern Congo, is providing a
glimpse of how the war in central Africa, fought for five years
now, is destroying the region's distinctly beautiful wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   In neat rows near the park entrance, workers have created an
above-ground graveyard for the victims' remains: the skulls of more
than 40 elephants, three grown gorillas and a baby. Nearby lay the
tiny severed hands of two small gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Rwanda they are talking about a human genocide,'' Basengezi
Katintima, governor of South Kivu province in eastern Congo, said,
looking over his shoulder at the skulls. ``Here we are talking
about an animal genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, park officials estimate that perhaps 100 of the 250
eastern lowland gorillas in park's highlands have been killed since
1996, along with three-quarters of the 400 forest elephants alive
before the war. Poaching has picked up markedly since April:
Arrested poachers have admitted to killing 20 gorillas and 17
elephants since then. Trade in ivory thrives.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the many combatants in Congo discuss peace, the war is
also clearly disrupting a complex dynamic _ among animals, local
people and rich foreign tourists _ that some conservationists
believe is the best hope for saving the dwindling wildlife of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, more than 3,000 tourists, most of them Americans
like Gates, the chairman of Microsoft Corp., visited the park each
year. They helped keep poachers away, in part because so many
people were in the forest. As important, their money helped build
schools, roads and water projects that made people in the poor and
densely populated area around the park feel they had a stake in its
survival.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with no tourists during five years of war, the local
economy has hit bottom. Mankoto Ma Oyisenzoo, a primatologist and
the park's director, said that elephant meat is popular because it
is half the price of beef ($1 for 2 pounds). Hostility to the park,
once the home of pygmies who hunted and collected wood and plants
for medicine, is rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have nothing,'' said Norbert Mushenzi, director
of the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day at the park, the authorities displayed half a
dozen arrested poachers, including Bulabi Lubaga, a 62-year-old
pygmy dressed in an irredeemably tattered jacket and pants. The
authorities say he is a longtime poacher. He said he was in the
park collecting honey and trapping monkeys to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hungry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lubaga is only a bit player in a poaching problem that
wildlife officials say has risen substantially since the turbulence
in Congo began in the early 1990s. Poaching has always existed,
officials say, but after 1994, the poachers began to do their work
with automatic weapons, which made killing far more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons were bought cheaply from former members of the
Rwandan Army, members of the Hutu ethnic group who fled Rwanda that
year after killing at least half a million Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Kahuzi-Biega National Park has been a base for Hutu
rebels and Congolese fighters called the Mayi Mayi through two
uprisings. The first one began in October 1996 and ended in the
overthrow of Mobutu Sese Seko, the longtime dictator of Congo, then
known as Zaire. The second began last August, and continues today
in its drive to oust Mobutu's successor, Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Oyisenzoo, the park director, said poaching has become highly
organized in the absence of any authority in the park. Elephants
are slaughtered for meat, he said, and the ivory is shipped to
Rwanda and then on to Dubai. Gorillas, he said, are also killed for
meat _ which he said costs about the same as elephant _ and their
heads are shipped abroad as trophies. Live baby gorillas are also
sold abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Oyisenzoo's numbers all the more worrying is that he
is only able to see a small part of the park, the highlands. The
vast lowlands, which make up about 90 percent of the park, are
still occupied by the Hutu rebels and the Mayi Mayi.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he fears that many of the 2,200 eastern lowland
gorillas there, among a total population of perhaps 5,000 in Congo
before the war, may have been slaughtered for meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mayi Mayi don't eat vegetables,'' he said. ``Only meat.''
</P>
<P>
   The park's eastern highlands are distinct for two reasons.
First, some experts say the gorillas there, while called lowland
gorillas, are actually closer genetically to the nearly extinct
mountain gorilla. There are only 650 mountain gorillas left, in
parks in Rwanda, Uganda and farther north in Congo. Eight tourists
were killed in March, by the same Hutu rebels, while tracking
mountain gorillas in Uganda, and tourism has yet to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Second, many of the gorillas killed recently _ 12 of the 20 in
the last three months _ had been conditioned to human contact.
Before the war, five families of gorillas had undergone what is
called ``habituation,'' a process that takes two years or more.
While some conservationists object, tourists could actually touch
the park's gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could swim among them,'' said John Kahekwa, 35, a gorilla
tracker who has worked in the park since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, four out of the five habituated silverbacks, the
male gorillas who lead the families, have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   And so now gorillas are much harder to find, which may make the
revival of the park, apart from the war, that much more difficult.
On a recent day, Kahekwa and other trackers followed a group of
gorillas once led by a silverback named Nindja.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997 Nindja was shot to death by poachers while
crossing a road. The head female of the group, Mugoli, which means
``queen'' in the local Mashi dialect, took over but has since been
afraid of human beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't want to see people because they fired on them,''
Kahekwa said.
</P>
<P>
   He led a group of visitors though the forest, stopping at one
point over the ashes of a campfire left by poacher and by a tree
where elephants had once scratched their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk in here every day and I haven't seen any elephants for
the past three months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The local authorities are praying for the war to end and for the
tourists to return. Although a peace accord was drafted earlier
this month in Zambia, the three rebel groups have yet to sign and
the fighting goes on, a bad sign for people and wildlife alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cannot respect man,'' Oyisenzoo asked, ``how can we
respect the animals in the forest?''

ANNE F. RICHARDSON, 69; WAS KEY POLITICAL WIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anne Francis (Hazard) Richardson, the wife of former US attorney
general Elliot L. Richardson, died of complications of Alzheimer's
disease Monday in Prince Georges Hospital Center in Cheverly, Md.
She was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The prototypical political wife, Mrs. Richardson was ``elegant
without haughtiness and purposeful but softly charming,'' according
to a story published in the Globe on Jan. 12, 1969.
</P>
<P>
   She was married to Richardson when he was attorney general,
secretary of defense, secretary of health, education and welfare,
ambassador to Great Britain, and lieutenant governor of
Massachusetts. It was a role she relished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't downgrade the supplementary role of the wife; many women
fulfill it with talent, wit, grace, energy, and intelligence,'' she
said in a 1974 Globe article. ``I certainly don't feel I've lost my
sense of identity as my own person. And I can accomplish a lot more
as Mrs. Elliot Richardson than I could as Ms. Anne Richardson.''
</P>
<P>
   She used her celebrity to shine a spotlight on various charities
and was chairwoman of Reading Is Fundamental, the national literacy
advocacy group, from 1981 to 1996. She was also affiliated with the
National Center for Voluntary Action and was chairwoman of the
advisory board of Second Genesis, a residential drug rehabilitation
program in the Washington area, where she lived.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Providence, R.I. and graduated from Radcliffe
College. She was an occassional book reviewer for the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   She met her future husband at a dance, where she was swept off
her feet by the law associate 10 years her senior. According to her
son, Michael, she later recalled that Richardson made a pest out on
himself by constantly cutting in, but she put up with it because he
was such a good dancer.
</P>
<P>
   When Richardson resigned as attorney general in 1973 rather than
obey President Nixon's order to fire Watergate special prosecutor
Archibald Cox, thus becoming a national symbol of integrity and
triggering an episode that became known as the ``Saturday Night
Massacre,'' Mrs. Richardson was in on the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role throughout the week prior to Elliot's resignation was
supportive,'' she said in 1973. ``I think he did the right thing,
and contrary to what some critics say, I feel he acted with
extraordinary grace and big-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any doubt about Elliot's resignation,'' she
said. ``Once the president insisted that he remove Archibald Cox,
Elliot knew that he had no choice but to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He consulted with me about the details surrounding the
announcement of his resignation and asked me how I thought the
public would react to the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of us expected the tremendous ovation his colleagues
gave him when he walked into the Hall of Justice for the
post-resignation press conference,'' she said. ``I found it
difficult to keep from crying. I had no idea that the people in
justice felt so deeply, agreed with Elliot so intensely.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, former first lady Barbara Bush described Mrs.
Richardson as a ``precious figure'' and said ``thanks to her
tireless effort with Reading Is Fundamental, millions of children
have learned the joy of a good book.''
</P>
<P>
   Beside her husband, she leaves a daughter, Nancy Carlson of St.
George, Vt.; two sons, Henry of Washington and Michael of Upper
Montclair, N.J.; two brothers, T.P. Hazard Jr. of Rockville, Md.,
and Oliver C. Hazard of Bedford, N.Y.; a sister, Mary ``Muffy''
Conrad of Albuquerque; and seven grandchildren.

 &HT;    Mindspring to exceed ad spending estimates By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises announced plans to pour
approximately $45-55 million more than it had originally planned
into advertising and marketing to aggressively accelerate growth
over the next three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   President and chief operating officer Michael S. McQuary said
the increased advertising and marketing push is an indication that
MindSpring has confidence in its ability to bring in new
subscribers through growth as well as acquisition. The company had
originally planned to spend 20 per cent of revenue on marketing and
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The company also reported it had revenues of $85.6 million, up
from $25.1 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring lost $7.1 million, or 11 cents per share, in the
second quarter compared with income of $2 million, or 4 cents per
share last year. The results included amortization from recent
Netcom and SpryNet acquisitions. Excluding these items, MindSpring
earned $7.5 million, or 11 cents per share, in the latest quarter,
up from $2.7 million, or 5 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   First Call analysts called for MindSpring to earn 9 cents per
share, excluding amortization.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second consecutive loss after five profitable
quarters, but McQuary says MindSpring is willing to suffer
short-term losses to pursue larger, loftier goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are foregoing short term profitability to be more valuable
in the long term. We can only do this because we have proven we had
a business model that was profitable and proven we could set a plan
and manage to that plan. Our shareholders and they analysts who
follow us are comfortable that we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   McQuary said that MindSpring would continue to exercise the
fiscal discipline it has become known for. ``The targets and the
milestones we've set for ourselves are longer leaps, but we have a
lot of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Since MindSpring announced a few weeks ago it was in discussions
about ``possible business combinations,'' rumors of mergers and
takeovers have been rampant. One of the most prevalent rumors
linked MindSpring with Dell Computer. However on Tuesday, Dell
announced it would form its own Internet access service that did
not involve MindSpring.
</P>
<P>
   McQuary would not comment on whether MindSpring had been talking
with Dell, but he did say the Dell ISP has its work cut out for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardware companies are going to be absolutely shocked at
the skill set it takes to make subscribers happy and run an
internet service,'' he said, adding that MindSpring didn't have any
immediate plans to begin manufacturing and selling PCs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have skill sets in that area. You can teach a pig to
dance, but it's not a pretty dance and the pig doesn't like it
much. It's not as easy as it looks,'' he said.

14 WHO FAKED DISABILITIES FOR PARKING SPOTS FACE PENTALTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The 14 current and former UCLA football players
who faked medical excuses to secure handicapped parking placards
could face six months in jail each or a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   But Enid Awad has another penalty in mind. The executive
director of Southern California Rehabilitation Services wants to
see them sentenced to work with the people whose parking spaces
they allegedly stole.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young men obviously have no clue how difficult it might
be to have limitations on your mobility,'' Awad said. ``They should
have to see what it's like when you can't just get up and throw
your clothes on and run out the door. I really believe that will
help them come to see that what they did was wrong, not just that
they got caught.''
</P>
<P>
   The athletes _ who claimed to have medical conditions ranging
from bad knees to the facial nerve ailment known as Bell's palsy _
are scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in Los Angeles. As the
result of a six-month investigation launched after a university
police officer spotted a car with an improperly displayed placard,
each is charged with illegal possession of a parking placard and
filing a false report with the state Department of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   While officials at the University of California at Los Angeles
and the athletes themselves have largely kept quiet on the scandal,
disabled activists throughout the city have taken it as an
opportunity to underscore problems with accessible parking that
they say are not limited to UCLA. A protest is planned outside the
courthouse, with demonstrators expect to demand both an
investigation into the state system of awarding the placards and
the suspension of the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a blessing in disguise for the community, because this
practice is really pervasive but it has never been put on the map
as an issue until now,'' said Lillibeth Navarro, who gets around in
a motorized wheelchair. ``Thousands and thousands of people respect
accessible parking spaces, but many people abuse them and laugh
about it. Well, the party's over.''
</P>
<P>
   DMV spokesman Evan Nossoff said the agency has no way to measure
handicapped parking fraud, but that it had run sting operations at
UCLA before a change in the law allowed local parking authorities
to do their own investigations. Statewide, there are about 1
million disabled parking permits, 200,000 of them assigned on a
temporary basis.
</P>
<P>
   On UCLA's rolling campus, located in the heart of Westwood, any
parking space is coveted, even at $225 per semester. The
university, which has about 37,000 students and another 22,000 or
so non-student employees, does not charge for disabled parking
permits. There are 551 of them, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain the permits, the football players allegedly bought
doctors' forms with forged signatures, filled in their own
ailments, then sent them in for approval. Chicago Bear Cade McKown,
a former UCLA athlete, told the Chicago Tribune he had a
handicapped placard from Feburary through mid-June 1997. ``I didn't
use it for handicapped spaces,'' he said. ``I can count on one hand
the number of times I used it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   That was one time too many for Brian Williams the Los Angeles
city attorney overseeing the case. Although the athletes are
charged with misdemeanors, he said he considers their alleged
offenses serious. He said he wants to use the case to send a
message to anyone who would abuse handicapped parking, especially
in the car culture that is California.
</P>
<P>
   Jail time would not accomplish that, he added. The athletes,
however, will have to cite the arrests and charges on future job
applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a disposition in this case that the defendants
will never forget,'' Williams said. ``But it isn't a problem that's
endemic only to athletes. It occurs everywhere and people don't
take it as seriously as they should.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in a prepared statement, UCLA Chancellor Albert
Carnesale condemned the student-athletes' alleged conduct. Head
football coach Bob Toledo went so far as to say he was
``embarrassed and disappointed for the young men who were involved
in this problem.'' He added that he would discipline the players
involved. UCLA is expected to have an announcement Wednesday after
the athletes' appearance in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a pretty lowdown person to do what they did,'' said
Nossoff, of the DMV. ``I think it would certainly be appropriate
for these football players to provide their services over a period
of time for disabled people who could use their strength and who
wouldn't take it for granted.''

BRAZIL CUTS OFF TRADE WITH ARGENTINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Brazil has halted all commercial
negotiations with Argentina after the two countries, South
America's largest economies, clashed in a series of trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by the Argentines on Monday to review imports for
evidence of unfair trading practices and possibly to impose
restrictions in some areas led to Brazil's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians also called for a meeting next week with
Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, the members of the Mercosur
regional trade zone, to discuss the bloc's future. Mercosur has
economically benefited all its members by stimulating cross-border
trade through lower tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of protection by Argentina is not legally foreseen
within Mercosur, which was created under the principles of free
trade,'' Jose Alfredo Graca Lima, an undersecretary in Brazil's
foreign ministry, said to reporters in the capital, Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the bloc's two largest members represents
the most serious crisis to confront Mercosur since it was formed in
1991. Mercosur ranks as the world's third-largest trading bloc,
though well behind the North American Free Trade Agreement and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mercosur expanded trade among its four members to $18.2
billion last year from $3.6 billion in 1991, a severe regional
economic slowdown has strained relations between Brazil and
Argentina. The flash point of recent tension can be traced to
Brazil's currency devaluation in January, which destabilized the
flow of regional trade.
</P>
<P>
   After the devaluation, Argentina's exports to Brazil, its
largest trading partner, tumbled more than 30 percent in the first
quarter of the year. And although Brazilian goods were made cheaper
with the decline of the real against the Argentine peso, which is
locked into the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar, exports to
Argentina also declined, falling 22 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The slump in economic activity in both countries explains the
fairly severe decline in trade. And Argentina, which is more
dependent on the larger, more varied Brazilian economy than vice
versa, appears to be under greater strain.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there have been an estimated 10 bond defaults by
Argentine borrowers in international markets so far this year,
compared with half that number by Brazilian borrowers. Argentina's
gross domestic product is forecast to shrink 3 percent this year,
compared with a 1 percent expected decline in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's first serious dispute with Brazil came in the form
of an anti-dumping charge against the Brazilian steel industry late
last year, and was followed by restrictions on Brazilian textiles.
Similar actions involving Brazilian shoes and sugar are under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Europe and the U.S. are also our significant trading
partners, the problems with Argentina don't always merit great
attention,'' said Michel Alaby, vice president of the Mercosur
Integration Association of Brazilian Companies. ``But in Argentina,
where trade with Brazil is so important, this is a very big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   While economic concerns are overriding, Brazil's pressure on
Argentina is also political.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians, who are seeking to exert greater influence in
Latin America, were irked by Argentine overtures to become closer
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Speculation that
Argentina might adopt the dollar as its currency has also worried
Brazil's government.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, relations between the two countries are better than
they were 20 years ago, when Argentina and Brazil were stockpiling
weapons and considered each other potential enemies.

 Valerie Gladstone's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was
about the dancer-choreographer David Parsons.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To many New Yorkers, Lincoln Center Out of Doors has
always been there _ an extravaganza every August that offers a
diverse fare of free dance, music and theater. The forthcoming
series, Carnival of the Century, starting Friday through Aug. 29,
is solidly within that tradition.
</P>
<P>
   It includes the jazz pianist Dave Brubeck, a Greek blues singer,
Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, music of the Jewish
Diaspora, a Peruvian dance company and the Colorado String Quartet,
plus entertainment for children.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1970, when Leonard de Paur, who died last year
at 83, introduced outdoor events to Lincoln Center, that anyone
took advantage of the potential of an arts festival on the site.
Before then _ long before Summerstage in Central Park and Celebrate
Brooklyn _ an outdoor festival would have been a novel concept any
place in New York City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When de Paur (pronounced pour) became director of community
relations at Lincoln Center in 1968, he had already achieved
success as conductor of his own popular choral groups, Broadway
musicals and symphony orchestras and as musical director of the
Negro Federal Theater in New York City. In many ways, Lincoln
Center proved a logical next step for a man committed to bringing
the arts to the widest possible public.
</P>
<P>
   This year's festival is dedicated to de Paur. On opening night,
Andrew Young, de Paur's brother-in-law and a former ambassador to
the United Nations, will join other speakers in honoring the man
from Summit, N.J. ``As a conductor,'' Young said in a recent
interview, ``Leonard brought the American idiom, jazz and
spirituals, to classical music, which was then largely European.
</P>
<P>
   Without him, there would be no Wynton Marsalis. In a sense, he
was to classical music what Jackie Robinson was to baseball, except
in baseball it was about color. In classical music, segregation
went deeper, depriving us of a world of diverse rhythms and
harmonies. At Lincoln Center, he broadened the audience for all the
arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics prove this. Every summer, at least 250,000 people
sample the festival's varied events, many of them newcomers to
Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   De Paur's history is well tended by his widow, Norma. On the
piano in their apartment in Harlem, she has arranged a large
selection of family photographs. Many of them feature their son and
daughter, Leonard (known as Laddie) and Norma Lynn, and Laddie's
three children.
</P>
<P>
   A scrapbook contains pictures of de Paur conducting his choirs
all over the world. In a formal portrait, with pipe in hand, he
looks distinguished in a well-cut tweed jacket and stylish tie,
though his expression suggests a certain irony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Leonard could never hide the twinkle in his eye,'' Mrs. de
Paur said. ``He inevitably saw the humor in a situation.'' From the
bookshelves, she brought out his recordings of Virgil Thomson's
opera ``Four Saints in Three Acts'' and Gershwin's ``Porgy and
Bess,'' with Leontyne Price and William Warfield. ``The outdoor
festival didn't happen in a direct fashion,'' she explained. ``It
came out of music, out of his arranging the International Choral
Festival at Lincoln Center. He invited choirs from 58 different
countries. Afterward, they asked him to take on more
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lincoln Center offered no specifics. When John Mazzola, then
president of Lincoln Center, hired him, de Paur asked what his job
would entail. A few hours later, Mazzola's secretary arrived with a
couple of index cards, on which were typed the simple, albeit
daunting, instructions: Get the community to Lincoln Center, and
take Lincoln Center to the community. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to cast about for things that I could do that would
bring some life to the place,'' de Paur said in an oral-history
interview, which is in the Lincoln Center archives, ``and I had
some luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck arrived in the form of Con Edison, which was interested in
sponsoring community arts groups. He had already been trying to
figure out how to create community nights; now he had financial
backing to go forward. ``We'll give you the facilities, and we'll
support you,'' he announced to arts organizations in all the city's
boroughs. ``You've only got to do two things: bring the attraction
and bring an audience from your community.'' Thus the Community
Holiday Festival was born and continued every Christmas season
until 1994 in Alice Tully Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Now de Paur had to deal with the summer season. ``The minute I
took over the management of things on the plaza,'' he said, ``I
clashed with a few administrators because their idea of a plaza was
freshly scrubbed, totally unencumbered by humanity and, if
encumbered by humanity, only by those people who were heading into
the opera house or to Philharmonic Hall with tickets for the right
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what appalled me so. I looked out the window and here's
this magnificent plaza and not a thing on it but pigeons. I thought
of some of the places I had seen in Europe, like St. Mark's, and I
said: `God, what a shame! It's gorgeous, it's beautiful, it's
wonderful, and nobody's making any use of it or deriving any
benefit from it.' Lincoln Center is a home of the living arts, and
by God, if we can't bring some life in here we're not fulfilling
our mandate.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   De Paur quickly defeated his adversaries and moved on. ``I
wanted the things on that plaza open to the broadest possible
public, in programmed fashion, so that you could come in the
morning and stay to midnight and see something every minute you
were there,'' he said. ``I did a good job of mixing, but I needed
money.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He soon made a deal with Exxon to underwrite the festival costs,
even though his job didn't include development. When he told
Mazzola about the deal, Mazzola thought he was kidding. But before
long he also had the Chiquita Brands company on the bandwagon. For
at least one season, little donkey-pulled folk carts were dotted
around the plaza, stacked high with bananas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had kids with Chiquita banana hatbands handing out the
bananas,'' he said. ``I have a picture of my daughter back there in
one of them. New Yorkers couldn't believe they were getting
something free.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His son also helped. ``There was little money to spare,'' Laddie
de Paur recalled, ``so Pop had me and other 16-year-old kids doing
technical production for the shows.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The festival's first three seasons were dominated by street
theater, which cast amateurs as well as professionals in socially
conscious plays. In 1974 it began offering all kinds of
entertainment: a Hispanic version of the Broadway musical
``Kismet,'' the Symphony of the New World String Quartet, the
Jazzmobile Workshop Orchestra, Ballet Hispanico, Art Blakey and the
Jazz Messengers, and Dianne McIntyre's Sounds in Motion.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Leventhal, the current president of Lincoln Center, said
in an interview, ``Leonard quickly demonstrated that even though
what went on outside at Lincoln Center was free, it was just as
good as what went on inside.''
</P>
<P>
   De Paur's experience lay chiefly in music and theater, but he
also enjoyed dance. ``We were in a position,'' he said, ``to
introduce companies to much broader-based community audiences than
they got when they performed in City Center and places like that,
with ticket tariffs. We put them in Damrosch Park, on that stage in
back of the band shell, and we gave them everything we could _
lights, dressing space, good amplification. It was a good place to
perform. Dance did very well back there, and it became a
well-attended series every year.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The festival soon grew to be an important showcase for
up-and-coming modern-dance troupes. Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane, Garth
Fagan, Trisha Brown, Philadanco, Pilobolus and Steven Petronio all
presented work there in the early years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jenneth Webster, who became director on de Paur's retirement in
1988, carries on the tradition. This year, she awarded two of her
largest financial commissions to dance. They went to Philadanco,
which will perform Ronald K. Brown's ``Ode to Ellington'' on Aug.
19 and 20, and to the New York Baroque Dance Company for ``Vivaldi
Carnivale,'' which is choreographed by Catherine Turocy and
scheduled for Aug. 25 and 26.
</P>
<P>
   While the festival does offer some big names, it banks on the
participation of local talents. ``Today we're just as involved with
them as ever,'' said Ms. Webster. ``When we present Indian,
Chinese, Haitian or Mexican events, often the performers are from
right here in New York. What money we have to advertise, we spend
on their radio stations and in their newspapers. An entire Mexican
soccer team came to our Mexican concerts last year. Leonard wanted
everyone to feel welcome here, and I think they do.''

WARLIKE TERROR SPILLS OVER RUSSIAN BORDER FROM CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALYUGAYEVSKAYA, Russia _ The last thing Lidiya Semyonova and
her friends probably felt was the way their relief abruptly turned
to terror.
</P>
<P>
   They were strolling back to their homes in this small, dusty
border village late one night when a Russian police patrol offered
to escort them. Here in the violent badlands that separate Russia
and breakaway Chechnya, a little armed protection is never a bad
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time it was not enough. Sometime after midnight,
gunmen opened fire from close range on the officers' jeep, riddling
it with machine gun bullets and rocket-propelled grenades.
Semyonova, 24, three other young women, and two police officers
died instantly. Two others were badly wounded. The gunmen gathered
the Russians' weapons and disappeared into the woods that mark the
border with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The brutal attack last week _ unexplained and senseless _ was
typical of the wave of bloodshed that has left dozens dead and
hundreds missing, turning the territory surrounding the separatist
North Caucasus republic into a virtual war zone.
</P>
<P>
   Russia lost control over Chechnya in 1996, when its troops were
forced to withdraw after two years of fighting with rebels that
killed 80,000 people by most estimates. Now, with the recent events
on the Chechen border, Moscow is having trouble protecting its own
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Armed gangs operating around Chechnya have already turned the
border regions of Stavropol, Dagestan and Ingushetia into zones of
terror, where murder is common, hostage-taking for ransom is a
daily event and cattle-rustling and car theft are no longer looked
upon as serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demand Moscow's help with the border,'' said Yury Samarkin,
deputy head of the local administration in the area about
Galyugayevskaya. ``But it's only getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last three months, the gangs have grown bolder, launching
full-scale military attacks on the undermanned, poorly equipped and
woefully few Russian police checkpoints set up along the border.
The shooting near Galyugayevskaya was followed by two more deadly
attacks the next day, once again by unseen gunmen against Russian
police patrols. This time, two Russian commanders were killed and
seven police wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officially, there's not supposed to be a war on, but the
killing hasn't stopped and we find corpses every couple of days,''
said Sergeant Yevgeny Tkachenko, 23, as he and two comrades
patrolled the sand dunes that span the unmarked border between
Stavropol region and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, he came across the bodies of two fellow police
who had been shot in an ambush, again at close range. The gunmen
took the jeep and fled to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Tkachenko and his men are just police officers
patrolling their own Russian territory in the border town of Mirny
_ on cop's pay of less than a buck a day. But when they put on
their 40-pound flak jackets in the sweltering heat and leave the
heavily guarded police compound to patrol the border, they have the
furtive, surrounded look of soldiers in an occupying army _ eerily
reminiscent of the way Russian forces in Chechnya's capital,
Grozny, used to look during the war.
</P>
<P>
   That is because gunmen from the other side easily can cross the
border, an essentially unguarded and unmarked stretch of sand. The
200 men in Tkachenko's force are hard pressed to protect
themselves, much less prevent anyone from crossing the 80 miles of
no-man's land they are supposed to be guarding.
</P>
<P>
   One night last week, someone creeped up to within shooting range
of the compound and had begun digging breastworks before they were
detected and forced to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people in these villages are Chechens, and some of
them are spies,'' Tkachenko said as his patrol lumbered over the
dunes in a borrowed van. He was going to explain what that meant
when a voice crackled excitedly over his walkie talkie: ``Get OUT
of there RIGHT NOW!''
</P>
<P>
   The van spun around and sped away as quickly as it could. An
armored personnel carrier rumbled in the opposite direction toward
a nearby checkpoint that was under attack. The toll this time: four
Russian servicemen wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachenko, like many Russians here, would solve the problem by
installing fences, watchtowers, trip wires and a legitimate border
guard force. But that would merely legitimize Chechnya's claim to
independence, which Moscow refuses to accept.
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason people in Stavropol do not want the
border closed. The huge, largely agricultural region depends
heavily on trade with oil-rich Chechnya for fuel, which it pays for
in grain and flour. A closed border would cause even more economic
chaos in an already dirt-poor region. And closing the border would
hardly improve the lot of the hundreds of ethnic Russians who still
live in Chechnya and travel by day across the border to find work
and goods, or the 2,400 ethnic Chechens live on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one here in any position of authority supports the idea (of
closing the border),'' said Captain Igor Pogosov, a spokesman for
Stavropol region's police force. ``If our fields are plowed, it's
thanks to the Chechens.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Russian forces have tried to fight fire with fire.
Earlier this month, Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo vowed to
use artillery and helicopters to defeat the gunmen. Tuesday,
Rushailo told a press conference in Moscow that the tactic was
having a positive effect.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, police tell a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``They start firing out of those woods over there,'' said a
Pasha, a Chechen war veteran manning a police border post called
Checkpoint Number 7. ``We fire back. They start using mortars,
rockets, heavy artillery. We have machine guns. We call in the
helicopters, but by the time they get here, (the gunmen) are
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   While the situation on the ground looks like war, it lacks two
things all wars are supposed to have: a clear enemy, and a clear
reason. While the Russian police routinely refer to their
tormentors as ``the Chechens,'' in fact the only thing they truly
know is that the attackers come from the Chechen side of the
border. Are ``the Chechens'' trying to scare them? To test their
resolve? To win more territory for their separatist state? Or is
this all some dark political conspiracy dreamed up in the Kremlin?
No one on the Russian side can agree on the answer.
</P>
<P>
   The makeup of the gangs is even harder to ascertain. Pogosov
said police recently broke up a large kidnapping and rustling ring
in which most of the members were Russians. The gang would leave
clues to make police think they were operating out of Chechnya,
when in fact they were herding captured people and stolen cattle to
a neigboring Russian region.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens themselves deny involvement in the crimes. Edelbek
Ibragimov, until recently Grozny's chief envoy to Moscow, suggested
the upsurge in the fighting was a plot by Russian hawks to derail
planned talks between President Boris N. Yeltsin and Chechnya's
popularly elected leader, Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want the world to think we're bandits,'' Ibragimov
said. ``Why do they blame every crime that happens in Russia on
Chechnya? This is an open effort to discredit Maskhadov.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibragimov has a point there _ every time a bomb goes off in
Moscow, police, security forces and the media start looking for ``a
Chechen trail.'' But it is also true that the main effort to
discredit Maskhadov is coming from within Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov, a former Soviet military colonel who led Chechnya's
ligthly armed guerillas to victory against Europe's largest
military, has been unable to rein in his former lieutenants who say
he is too close to Moscow. Some of these ``field commanders,'' as
they are known in Russia, talk about setting up a radical, Islamic
conferedation that would include Chechnya and the neighboring
Russian regions to the east and west, Dagestan and Ingushetia.

GORE BLASTS PROPOSED GOP TAX CUTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seizing on what could become a key campaign issue,
Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday lambasted proposed GOP tax cuts,
arguing they would lead the nation back to the red ink of the Bush
and Reagan years.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the rhetoric of House and Senate Democratic leaders who
joined him at a Capitol Hill rally, Gore charged that the
Republican tax cuts would not only increase federal debt but
preclude efforts to strengthen Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember what happened the last time they tried to pull this
kind of accounting stunt,'' he said, referring to GOP tax cuts of
the early 1980s. ``We ended up quadrupling our national debt in
only a dozen years. We created annual budget deficits of $300
billion a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comments came the day before the Senate was to take up a
GOP-sponsored $792 billion tax cut. Last week the House approved a
tax cut of the same size but of a different composition.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan is targeted more at lower income taxpayers and
excludes some reductions included in the House bill, such as
capital gains tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton also continued to sound
the alarm by releasing a report showing that GOP tax cuts would put
at risk elderly women who rely on Medicare. Clinton has requested
that $375 billion of the surplus be set aside to extend the life of
Medicare and provide a new prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans have not allocated a specific amount for
Medicare, they argue that there will be plenty of money left over
after they deal with Social Security to take care of the health
care program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that the debate is more about the size and details of
any tax cut. He and other Democrats are backing $320 billion in
targeted tax reductions proposed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Charging that the ``Republican leadership is beholden to special
interests,'' Gore criticized some of the benefits tucked into the
House bill, including tax breaks for the restaurant and oil and gas
industries.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not single out GOP presidential contenders, Gore
called on Republican party leaders to repudiate the tax cut. And he
sought to remind voters that they do not want to return to the
economic policies of Republican administrations that helped create
big deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now when Republicans come back and offer the hair of the dog
that bit them, offering to take us back to the old ways that ran
the economy into the ground, surely members of their own party will
stop and think back before they go back,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore did not mention Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a leading
GOP presidential hopeful, the Democratic National Committee made it
clear in a news release that it believed the governor was
vulnerable on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush cannot simultaneously support the Republican Party's tax
plan and credibly claim he wants to `leave no one behind,'' stated
DNC chairman Roy Romer.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been encouraged by polls showing that the public
does not rank tax cuts as a top priority. The polls also show that
women in particular tend to favor Clinton's emphasis on saving
Medicare over giving out big tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign stump speeches, Bush says he supports tax cuts
and last week, when asked by reporters in Iowa, the governor said
he would sign the House GOP tax proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said that the governor holds that
``if you have a president who will set priorities and follow
through on them, he believes you can fix Social Security, modernize
Medicare, rebuild our defense and give working people tax relief,''
</P>
<P>
   While the Texas governor has endorsed GOP tax plans he has not
made their passage a central element of his campaign message.
Tucker also said she had not heard the governor address certain
controversial specifics in the House GOP bill such as reducing
capital gains taxes and increasing tax deductions for business
meals.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders continued to defend the cuts, arguing there
is a healthy enough surplus to save Social Security and Medicare
and return money to the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton and his Democratic allies don't trust the
American people to spend their money wisely. But Republicans do,''
said Rep. J.C. Watts, the House Republican Conference Chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the partisan rhetoric there have been divisions within
both parties on the size and shape of a tax cut. Some moderate
Republicans rebelled at the size of the reduction pushed by House
leaders. In the Senate, some centrist Democrats are advocating a
compromise $500 billion tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   One of those Democrats, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., writing in
Tuesday's Washington Post, said that it was ludicrous ``to suggest
that we can't afford to cut income taxes when we are running a $3
trillion surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said that it wasn't tax cuts that were standing in the
way of shoring up Medicare and Social Security but the reluctance
of lawmakers to make the painful structural changes in those
programs. Kerrey, who has been somewhat of a maverick in the
Democratic Party, is backing Gore's opponent, former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley, in the presidential primary.

BARAK, ARAFAT SEEK WAY TO REVIVE PEACE PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
president Yasser Arafat met late into Tuesday night for their first
substantive meeting aimed at hammering out the details of advancing
the long-stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
   And when the two men emerged from the meeting it was clear they
still had more work to do.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told reporters at a press conference that Arafat would
respond within two weeks to an Israeli proposal to delay
implementation of parts of the interim peace deal known as the Wye
River agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Barak added that if Arafat rejected his proposal to fold Wye
into the larger framework of the final phase of the peace process,
that Israel would still implement Wye.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to Wye. We will implement Wye,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   But standing next to Barak at the press conference, Arafat
seemed to offer a clear answer to Barak that ruled out straying
from the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard his idea and I have replied,'' Arafat said. ``I
told Prime Minister Barak that it is very necessary to immediately
begin the full implementation of the Wye agreeement.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat said he also called on Barak ``to cease all settlement
activities which are illegal and destructive to the peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wye agreement signed last October in Washington calls on
Israel to hand over 13 percent more West Bank land to Palestinian
rule, to release political prisoners, to allow construction of a
new seaport to begin, and to open the so-called ``safe passage''
routes connecting the pockets of Palestinian control from Hebron to
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   It also calls for the Palestinians to do more to fight against
terrorism aimed at Israeli civilians and to curtail anti-Israeli
rhetoric that incites violence.
</P>
<P>
   The blunt disagreement between the two men over implementation
of Wye seemed to cast a shadow over the promise that the newly
elected Barak had brought to a peace process that had been
characterized by mistrust under the leadership of his predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Authority Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo,
who participated in part of the meeting, described the disagreement
over implementation of the Wye accord to Reuters as a ``crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat met for more than two hours as a warm breeze
swept the desert and a full moon rose over the Erez Checkpoint at
the dusty border crossing between Israel and Palestinian-ruled
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the meeting was a test of the still developing
relationship between Barak and Arafat. And the body language of the
two leaders Tuesday night, as they shook hands warmly and smiled
for the cameras, indicated that despite their differences of
opinion they were still working together.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Jarbawi, a political science professor at Ber Zeit
University in the Palestinian-controlled West Bank, said, ``It was
a very disappointing meeting for Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wye was supposed to be the minimum withdrawal we would accept
before the next phase of withdrawals came. Now it is being
presented as all the Palestinians will get before the move to final
status talks,'' he said. ``Barak is saying precisely the same thing
as Netanyahu, only his accent is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli analysts say the meeting marks the end of the newly
elected prime minister's grace period. He will now have to do more
than state his intention to carry out the peace process, and
actually deliver on his promises. That is, if he wants to please
the voters who handed him an overwhelming victory in large part
because of his promise to get the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the grueling work must finally begin,'' Ze'ev Schiff, the
military analyst for the daily newspaper Ha'aretz, wrote in
Tuesday's editions. ``Barak must pay off his debts instead of
dining off declarations and promises.''

SEVERE BUDGET CUTS THREATEN RESEARCH, NASA OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than one week after the nation triumphantly celebrated the
30th anniversary of its greatest glory in space _ the first Moon
landing _ Congress is poised to slash the space program's budget to
an unprecedented degree. The agency's head says the proposed cuts
would be ``devastating,'' and advocates of space exploration call
the proposal ``irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed cuts, agreed to in a surprise move late Monday by a
House subcommittee, would trim the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's overall budget of $13.665 billion by nearly 10
percent, and cut its scientific research by almost one third. The
proposed budget will be voted on by the appropriations committee on
Friday and the full House next week.
</P>
<P>
   NASA administrator Daniel Goldin said Tuesday that ``not only is
this cut devastating to NASA's programs, it is a knife in the heart
of employee morale.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's budget has already been trimmed by 30 percent over
the last seven years, allowing for inflation. Yet many analysts say
that by improving efficiency NASA during the last decade has
actually shown it can accomplish more with less. That management
success may be haunting the agency now as it contemplates more
missions to Mars and expanded scientific projects.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Friedman, executive director of the nonprofit space
advocacy group the Planetary Society, said the cuts would be ``the
most devastating in NASA's history, and effectively curtail space
exploration after 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA's space science budget of $2.2 billion would be cut by $640
million, or 29 percent, under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's budget peaked during its glory days of project
Apollo when its $5.25 billion in 1965 amounted to almost 4 percent
of the entire federal budget. This year's budget of $13.665 billion
represents less than one percent of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   The latest cuts, pushed by the subcommittee's Republican
leadership in a last-minute move that had not been anticipated by
space policy analysts, is an attempt to comply with budgetary caps
that were passed years ago to control the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Republican leaders are already facing some
criticism for having exceeded the 1997 budget caps in several other
fiscal 2000 appropriations, and so may be feeling pressure to toe
the line on the caps wherever possible.
</P>
<P>
   But NASA has also earned the ire of some in Congress as it
fought intensely almost every year to preserve funding for large,
expensive programs. In particular, many in Congress see the
International Space Station as an overpriced project that will not
produce enough scientific or technical return to justify its cost.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, then-House speaker Newt Gingrich made some unusually
harsh comments about NASA, suggesting that the nation's access to
space had actually been hindered by the space agency's bureaucracy,
and that the agency lacked vision and direction.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee Chairman James Walsh, R-N.Y., the bill's chief
author, said the cuts in space spending were ``perhaps the most
difficult and painful choices'' he made in writing the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to that and other reductions, he said he would ``make
every effort to address these difficulties'' later this year, when
the legislation is likely to be part of budget negotiations with
the Clinton administration expected to result in higher spending.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts fear that may come too late to save the space
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once passed, it takes on a life of its own,'' Friedman said.
``It really is a threat.'' While the initiative for cutting the
budget has come from the Republican side, Friedman said there has
been little response from the Democrats: ``Nobody has come up and
started championing a different course,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among NASA's programs that would almost certainly face the ax if
the cuts stick, according to Friedman, are all missions to Mars
after 2001, including a planned mission to bring Mars rocks back to
Earth to search for evidence of life; an orbiter for Jupiter's moon
Europa, which may harbor oceans larger than Earth's; missions to
the outer planets; and the next ``great observatory'' satellite,
designed to join the Hubble telescope and the just-launched Chandra
X-ray telescope.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Goldin suggested that such a deep cut ``may force
the closure of one to three NASA centers, and significant layoffs
would most certainly follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the House itself had voted just a few weeks ago to
accept a report that recommended spending more on research in
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts found the subcommittee's move especially puzzling.
``It came out of nowhere, frankly,'' said John Pike, a space policy
analyst with the Washington-based Federation of American
Scientists. ``Most people figured that we had had the budget battle
over NASA a couple of years ago. The main budget battle this year
has been trying to figure out how to spend the surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the context of Washington's typically heated budget
debates, Pike said, ``it is really rather extraordinary and
unanticipated that they've chosen this moment to chop NASA up into
little tiny pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Pike said that practically speaking, whatever comes out of the
House budget process can be seen as an initial bargaining position
that will change during negotiations with the Senate, which has not
yet taken up the NASA budget. ``I assume that all of this is going
to get negotiated away in the conference committee, since there's
evidently not a basis for this kind of cut.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``everyone has to assume it's real, because it's
going to be real unless people do something to make it go away.''

TRIALS OF CANCER-STARVING DRUG COULD BEGIN IN 60 DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Advanced cancer patients could begin receiving the
promising tumor-starving drug endostatin at Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute within 60 days, according to the biotech company
sponsoring the first human tests of the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Entremed, Inc., which makes endostatin, Tuesday said it had
received clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration to
begin a Phase I trial, in which a drug is tested for safety, in
patients at Dana-Farber in the early fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very safe to say we're within a 60-day window'' of
beginning the trial, said Mary Sundeen, a spokeswoman for Entremed
in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Dana-Farber spokesman said the institute will not
begin recruiting patients until its protocol, or official plan for
the trial, has been reviewed and approved by two internal panels.
At that point, he said, the cancer institute will post information
about patient recruitment on its web site at www.dana-farber.net.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 patients will be enrolled in the trial at Dana-Farber
and two other centers, the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston
and the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wis., for the Phase I
studies. Only the Dana-Farber study is sponsored by Entremed; the
other two are sponsored by the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin is the most powerful of a class of substances called
angiogenesis inhibitors. It was discovered in the laboratory of Dr.
Judah Folkman at Children's Hospital and licensed to Entremed for
development.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman and his colleagues have led the study of angiogenesis,
the process by which small cancers recruit a life-support system of
small blood vessels from nearby tissues in the body. Without the
nourishment supplied by these vessels, the tumor cannot grow or
metastasize.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-angiogenic substances like endostatin attack and destroy
these small vessels, causing the tumors to shrink or even
disappear, yet don't directly target the tumors. This strategy
avoids the common problems of harsh side effects seen with standard
cancer drugs. Also, the tumors do not become resistant to
angiogenesis inhibitors, as they do with drugs that are designed to
poison the tumors.
</P>
<P>
   A number of angiogenesis inhibitors are in early testing in
humans, but none are as potent as endostatin is believed to be,
based on its powerful effects in rodents.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin will be tested in patients with a variety of solid
tumors, including lymphoma, said Sundeen.
</P>
<P>
   The Phase I trials are designed to look for toxic effects, she
said. But ``should we see a biological response in a patient during
the safety testing, they will have the option to continue taking
the drug outside the study,'' and the company will supply it, she
said.

``Thankfully no one has been hurt.

SPLASHING AROUND IN THE SHALLOWS OF WHITEWATER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Sylviane Gold, who reviews dance for Newsday, has been a theater
critic for The Wall Street Journal and other publications.  
 By SYLVIANE GOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The evidence is unimpeachable. Two stubbornly left-wing adults
who should know better have conspired to commit satire on the
person, the prosecutions, the very idea of Kenneth W. Starr, the
Whitewater independent counsel. Their confessions are on tape, and
this referral submits substantial and credible information on their
doings. It consists of several parts: five narratives and six
excerpts from the incriminating tapes.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD LINGEMAN (senior editor, The Nation): We only did what
we were told by our muse to do.
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR NAVASKY (publisher and editorial director, The Nation):
We were subpoenaed. We couldn't say no!
</P>
<P>
   NARRATIVE I What they did is write ``Starr's Last Tape,'' a
one-man play in which a character named Starr, dressed in a prison
jump suit and surrounded by tapes and tape recorders, sings hymns,
tunes in to phone taps and dictates his memoirs: ``Chapter 1.
Mission: To Trap a President.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of his dictation, he plays excerpts from his
thousands of hours of everyone on tape, including the president,
the First Lady and, of course, (italics)that(end italics) woman,
who is overheard opening her gift copy of ``Leaves of Grass'' and
saying ``Whoa, hey, is this about pot?'' Starr himself is caught on
tape interviewing a phone sex operator and personally wiring Linda
Tripp for sound.
</P>
<P>
   The play will have its world premiere in Stockbridge, Mass., at
the Berkshire Theater Festival's second stage, the Unicorn, from
Aug. 24 through 28. Brian Reddy, who played Stephen Douglas in the
1993 Lincoln Center Theater revival of ``Abe Lincoln in Illinois,''
will star as Starr, directed by Eric Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Maguire, the festival's producing director, was given the
play by a board member who is a friend of Navasky's. ``I laughed
out loud,'' she said. ``I thought that was a good sign. And no
matter what side you're on, the character of Ken Starr is
fascinating. He's like Ahab, this male character who goes after
something no matter what. A hunter.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Starr's Last Tape'' bears any resemblance to ``Krapp's Last
Tape,'' the great solo tour de force by Samuel Beckett, it's not
exactly accidental, Navasky says.
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY: The title seemed written in the ether. And once you
have that title, everything else sort of falls into place. From my
point of view, the elements that Beckett contributed are the title,
the concept and the banana.
</P>
<P>
   LINGEMAN: Krapp eats a banana in the play, and so does Starr.
But we felt free; we felt uninhibited by Beckett's text. Reading
it, you have a sense of a much higher level of art__
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY: Which is the higher level of art?
</P>
<P>
   LINGEMAN (laughs): Our play. No, Beckett's man talking with his
past sort of fertilized our imagination.
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY: Richard has a weak memory. I had the idea. The play
wrote itself. And Richard wrote all the jokes.
</P>
<P>
   NARRATIVE II Sitting in Navasky's office at The Nation, on
Irving Place, the two men trade their drolleries as if they have
been practicing for decades. They have. They met as students at
Yale Law School in 1956. In 1957, still students, they founded
Monocle, which they called ``A Leisurely Quarterly of Political
Satire.'' According to Navasky, that meant it came out twice a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in New York, they tried publishing it as a business
venture, which lasted until 1965. ``Our last price,'' Navasky said,
``was $7.50 for 10 issues, or $5 for a lifetime subscription.''
</P>
<P>
   Lingeman is a laconic foil for the more gregarious Navasky.
Named editor of The Nation, the proudly leftist near-weekly, in
1978, Navasky brought Lingeman on board the following year, and
they have been colleagues since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starr's Last Tape'' is not their first flirtation with show
business. Navasky had written plays in college. At Yale, Lingeman
wrote some Monocle pieces in the form of dialogue, and one was
performed at a New Haven cabaret with the actor and director Austin
Pendleton, then also a student, playing an Allen Ginsberg-like
character. In 1959 they wrote a musical, never produced, about the
Communist paranoia of the '50s. And in the early '60s Lingeman
tried his hand at comedy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY: We put our drama-writing careers in mothballs because
someone told us that George Kaufman had said satire is what closes
on Saturday night. And then we found a theater where they're
running this play from Tuesday to Saturday night. So we knew we had
written a real satire.
</P>
<P>
   LINGEMAN: But it is grounded in political realities and real
political values. As for Kaufman, he won the Pulitzer Prize__
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY: ``Of Thee I Sing'' ran for 441 performances, 55
Saturday nights. I looked it up.
</P>
<P>
   NARRATIVE III That 1931 musical, a gibe at a fictitious
presidential candidate running on a love platform, has far less
venom than does ``Starr's Last Tape'' (although, Navasky pointed
out, President Clinton is not exactly spared). Navasky sees the
play's cruelty as akin to caricature. ``A great caricaturist can
get at certain truths by not presenting a balanced picture,'' he
said. ``You go right for (italics)it,(end italics) you present your
view of what's at the center of what you're writing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what they have written about has been rather
extensively covered already.
</P>
<P>
   LINGEMAN: It's cheaper than the Starr Report. And also dirtier.
In the course of parodying the subject, you are forced to discuss
certain sexual matters__
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY: Which otherwise would be inappropriate for people over
a certain age.
</P>
<P>
   NARRATIVE IV The play was written in the same back-and-forth way
they talk, each writing material and then handing it off to the
other for editing. Navasky says he would pull it out and show it to
anyone who asked what he was up to. One was that Berkshire Theater
Festival board member. Another was his friend Arthur Penn, the
director who heads the Actors Studio.
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY: I'd show it to everyone I ran into. ``Hey, whattaya
doing?'' ``We're writing a play! Wanna read it?'' ``Well, er, uh.''
</P>
<P>
   LINGEMAN: We got a lot of discouraging remarks.
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY: Except for Arthur Penn, who was a very helpful
kibitzer, for three drafts.
</P>
<P>
   NARRATIVE V Penn says that even though the first draft was too
informational, its potential as an appropriately vicious satire of
Ken Starr was evident. Now, he says, the biggest problem is that it
is a huge job for an actor.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend, the agent Sam Cohn, volunteered no comments on
the first version. But when he read the second draft, he offered to
take on the project. ``I thought it was politically and
historically important,'' Cohn said.
</P>
<P>
   Navasky also showed the script to Bob Balaban, the actor and
director.
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY: Next thing we knew, we got a call from Bob saying
Richard Dreyfuss is coming by and he's agreed to do a reading. He
also got some other actors to be the taped voices. For the first
time, we could see there were parts of it that didn't work and
parts of it that were very funny. People were laughing out loud. So
we took out the funny parts and expanded the parts that didn't
work.
</P>
<P>
   LINGEMAN: We took it closer to the Beckett model, which is: Life
is grim.
</P>
<P>
   NAVASKY: Don't give away the ending.
</P>

SUBDUED KENNEDY RETURNS TO SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Edward M. Kennedy came to work at noon
Tuesday, hours later than usual. He went to a weekly Democrats'
luncheon in the Capitol looking tired. People around him said he
seemed subdued.
</P>
<P>
   But he was here. Four days after scattering the ashes of his
nephew, John F. Kennedy Jr., into the sea, Kennedy returned to the
office he has held for 37 years and began the familiar process of
readjusting to routine life _ surrounded by the work that has, in
many ways, been the most permanent fixture he has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues said he seemed a far cry from the man who two weeks
earlier waged a fierce battle on the Senate floor over managed
health care. Some aides to other senators also privately wondered
whether it might take longer for him to recover this time, whether
there might be a cumulative toll to so much tragedy in one person's
life.
</P>
<P>
   Among senators, however, few were surprised when Kennedy
returned to the Senate chamber Monday night to cast two procedural
votes, with his son, Representative Patrick Kennedy of Rhode
Island, at his side. Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle
began the Democratic policy luncheon by welcoming Kennedy back _
``back to his family here in the Senate,'' Daschle later said. Many
agreed that Kennedy has never run from work during tough times.
This time, they said, would be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us would have understood if he wasn't back right
away,'' said Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat from Iowa, after the
lunch. ``But his coming back is just another indication that he's
not going to dwell on the setbacks in life. He's going to dwell on
what's possible. And that's an inspiration to us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had planned on a hectic legislative calendar this year,
with debates on all his pet issues: health care, education and the
minimum wage. Before July 17, when John Kennedy Jr.'s plane was
reported missing, he was on a roll, repeatedly leading the
Democratic rallying cry _ after impeachment, over gun control, over
securing rights for medical patients.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest political victory this year came two weeks ago.
After singlehandedly holding up the Senate for days to force
Majority Leader Trent Lott to debate health care, Kennedy led the
charge with a so-called Patients Bill of Rights, delivering such
rousing speeches that other senators began ribbing him about his
enthusiasm on the floor. Democrats ultimately lost, but it was seen
as a public relations triumph, with Republicans cast as villains
for killing a measure that would help women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the final vote July 15, Kennedy bounded down the
Capitol steps, talking excitedly about his weekend plans to attend
his niece Rory's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, it was on to the next piece of legislation to
expand the definition of a ``hate crime'' to include sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crash occurred the next night, killing the young
Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, Lauren
Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   All other plans were instantly changed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, after 10 days of horrifying developments and family
tragedy, Kennedy began to ease back into the world of politics. He
was briefed twice by his staff about prescription drug coverage and
attended the Democratic luncheon. He got news about the ongoing
debate over taxes in Congress and made tentative plans to introduce
an amendment _ again, related to prescription drug coverage _ later
in the week.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Capitol, his son also went back to
work. Patrick Kennedy attended meetings at the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, which he heads, and cast several
votes. He was ``easing his way back into it,'' spokesman Tony
Marcella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's going to take them awhile to get back into their
full routine,'' Marcella said of both Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   When that will occur remains to be seen, although Senator
Kennedy may speak on the floor of the Senate as early as this week,
addressing measures concerning prescription drug coverage and the
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, however, he began his gradual return to public speaking
with remarks to fellow Democrats. At the luncheon, Senator John F.
Kerry said, Kennedy ``thanked everybody for their expressions of
concern, their telephone calls, and said how much it meant to him
and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Kerry said: ``He expressed his own happiness at being back
in the fold, back in the Senate family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the fight is needed, Ted Kennedy will be there without
reserve, because that's the way he is,'' Kerry said.

<P>
   LESKOVAC, Yugoslavia _ Vlada sleeps late and often doesn't
bother to shave. He says he has stopped talking in his sleep, but
often finds himself shuddering uncontrollably, staring down at his
trembling body as if it belonged to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   His business as an artisan is suffering, but he is forgiving
people their debts, because he knows they have no money to spare.
``I'm satisfied with small things now,'' he said, licking the paper
on a cheap Drina cigarette, so it would burn longer. ``I want to
make a lot of friends and not argue over anything petty. But if
there's a car accident and there are dead _ I'm utterly
indifferent.''
</P>
<P>
   Vlada, 31, was a unit commander of the Yugoslav army in Kosovo.
He hated it, but he's proud that he passed through, and he thinks
he has kept his soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was awful in Kosovo,'' he said. ``It was full of
horrible things. Not on the level of massacres, not that I saw
happening, at least, but there was nothing good. I think of myself
as a form of pacifist, and even going there was horrible enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was ethnic purging, and some of his men helped carry
it out. They held the ground while police and paramilitaries moved
through villages, killing and expelling Albanians, then secured the
villages afterward. They looted freely and burned houses and stood
by while others did the dirtiest work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a war down there, and the main thing was to stay
alive,'' Vlada said. ``Mostly when I arrived the cleansing was
done, and it was done by police and paramilitaries, and it was
awful and stupid. We soldiers are softer, we are not murderers, and
it's an ugly thing to say, but those guys did a job for us, and if
we did it we would have a lot more dead on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his men spent 60 days without water or electricity,
usually sleeping on the floor of an abandoned or cleansed Albanian
house in the hills, moving between Gnjilane and Kacanik. They drank
water from which they removed the tadpoles and dumped in purifying
tablets.
</P>
<P>
   Vlada watched his friends crack up or die or turn into avid
looters or killers. They dug in against NATO bombing, and they
lived with the constant fear of being uniformed soldiers in a
hostile countryside facing a peasant army. It wasn't just the
Kosovo Liberation Army, for whom Vlada has only marginal respect,
but of booby-traps and ambushes and almost any Albanian civilian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dangerous to turn your back, even on an old lady,'' he
said. ``You always had your gun in your hands or within reach.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the story of an Albanian in civilian clothes walking
toward a Serb soldier, who approached him, while two uniformed
Albanian fighters shot from an ambush. ``It was a tactic,'' Vlada
said. ``And the guy who didn't shoot was a fool, and his family is
without him. But if he shot first, then he's a murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   He rubbed his face and licked another Drina.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was mobilized, I went to church and prayed for two
things,'' he said. ``First, not to kill anyone. And second, to come
back alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the first prayer was answered, he said. At least he thinks
so.
</P>
<P>
   But then he tells the story of three members of his unit who
killed three Albanian fighters at close range at the end of the
war. ``Each one thinks he didn't kill someone,'' Vlada said. ``But
those guys had so many bullets in them, each one must have hit them
all.''
</P>
<P>
   He commanded a small unit of 14 or so soldiers who patrolled,
and ``we became very good,'' he said with some pride. ``We
protected each other and we were faithful to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of looting, he said. ``In the beginning, it was
silently licensed by the officers, under the theory, `Take what you
need or want and use it when you're here.' Then people got crazy
and took a lot of things. The first thing stolen from a house was
the television. Our unit sometimes had seven sets, but of course
there was no electricity,'' he said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   And there was no way to bring the loot back, except for the
officers, who had access to trucks. So there was a lot of
destruction, too, especially of expensive things like televisions,
video recorders, refrigerators and tractors.
</P>
<P>
   About the expulsion and murder of Albanian citizens, his stories
track with those of others. In general, the army held the ground;
special police units and paramilitary units, sometimes with long
hair, beards and bandanas, like actors in Hollywood movies, cleared
the villages, often killing those who resisted leaving; the
civilians were channeled along certain roads toward buses or the
border; bodies were often cleared out by other police units; and
then the army checked through the villages again.
</P>
<P>
   But there was some army involvement. For these special actions,
``to expel or cleanse or whatever you say,'' Vlada said another
officer would come to collect two men, who would be gone for 48
hours or so.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers mostly kept away from the paramilitaries and
special police units, particularly the legendary ``Frenki's boys,''
named after a former commander of the special antiterrorist units
of the police, Franko Simatovic. They are big, well-equipped,
ruthless and ordered to not even discuss their training.
</P>
<P>
   Vlada described the clearing of Zegra, south of Gnjilane.
``About 260 of them cleaned Zegra in 12 hours, 6,000 to 7,000
people. They took about a minute a house. There was shooting. The
volunteers got to the center of town and started to shoot the first
people to come to them. The whole village heard this and people
started to run away on their own, and there were police to guide
them toward Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they went into the houses, looking for people, and
sometimes Albanian fighters remained and there were firefights.
``Soldiers couldn't do that,'' Vlada insisted. ``It would have
taken us three days to do all the houses. Soldiers couldn't just go
into a house and start shooting all the people in the house right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped, sighed, continued. ``It was ugly but it happened,
and everyone you saw felt like an enemy. It's the worst kind of
war. A granny could have a grenade. The first blood demands second
blood, revenge, and so it goes. The KLA had their positions and
their bunkers themselves, and as we were drafted, so were they, and
their orders were to stay and cause trouble, and many of them were
sacrificed.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, he said, some people liked the killing. ``You find
out a lot about people in 24 hours in a war,'' he said. He
described clearing a house in a village where there were elderly
Albanians still inside. One man went in while he and another
soldier kept guard over the house, when another group of Serbs
arrived, pulling out knives and wanting to kill the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are my Albanians, and if you want to kill Albanians you
go catch them in some other house,'' Vlada told them. ``But I was
scared. It was stupid. We were yelling and nearly shooting each
other and we were all targets, and if someone was hiding in the
stable he could have killed us all.''
</P>
<P>
   They burned many houses, ``especially the big, rich ones,''
Vlada said. ``If we got in a house where we found KLA insignia, or
uniforms or pictures of men in KLA uniforms with arms, you cannot
stay calm. They are not the only ones guilty for this war, but they
are among them. And a lot were in big houses, with Jacuzzis, and
Albanian flags, when 70 percent of those in Albania don't have
electricity, and you can't be calm. There's rage in you and you ask
yourself, what more does he want than this? There is no sign inside
of this country, but only of another country, and it burns.''
</P>
<P>
   He became mystical about the houses, he said. ``Sometimes, they
won't burn, even with oil. It's like the house protects itself,''
he said. ``Then I thought, `This is the house of honest people,'
and I ordered, `Leave this house alone, you can see it won't
burn.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Serbs thought the Albanians would never be back to
demand an accounting, Vlada sighed. ``People thought there would be
some deal with NATO or a partition of Kosovo or something. They
were stupid. You can't clean out 2 million people or kill 100,000
people, but some thought you could. There were a lot of army and
police, and you had the weapons, and the Albanians were too few and
poor. And without NATO, they could have done nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Life at war was exhilarating and terrifying, full of adrenaline
and sensation, and life afterwards is pallid and full of worries,
especially in a war-broken, sanctions-broken economy where money,
gasoline, sugar and even cooking oil are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Vlada has taken part in the daily demonstrations of army
reservists in Leskovac for their back pay and for the resignation
of President Slobodan Milosevic. His experience is typical of many
of the reservists interviewed, but he was a commander and more
insightful than most. There is fury here, but unfocused, a tinder
box waiting for a leader and a spark. But the daily demonstrations
are dwindling, last only about 15 minutes, and often no one even
speaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's apathy,'' Vlada said. ``There are lots of problems to
deal with, daily things like money and bread, and like an animal,
you deal with those things only.''
</P>
<P>
   No one here really wants to hear about the war. There are
already a lot of divorces among his friends, he said. ``People
can't talk about it. Your life is awful and you're trying to
survive that. People ask, `How are you?' The answer now is: `Same
as you,' and everyone's face falls.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, he said, ``people feel like the war was two years ago _
they're trying to cope with current problems, trying to get money,
trying to prepare for the winter,'' canning and storing food, when
they can afford it, or cutting wood.
</P>
<P>
   As for questions of war crimes, ``it's the same as in
Belgrade,'' Vlada said. ``No one wants to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't much matter now, he says. ``Kosovo and its
problems are too far away. It's a luxury to think of Kosovo when I
have such problems here. People are so poor that when they go to
the shops they just write IOU's. It makes you feel guilty, you feel
somehow lost, you lose all the self-confidence that you had when
you were there, in Kosovo.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first days after the reservists came home, the police were
absent. Now, with the protests, they cruise around the town, not
just in their little Zastava cars, but big blue four-wheel drive
vehicles with white bars on the windows. Many of them are from
surrounding towns, Vlada says. ``It's good thinking. It's hard to
beat or arrest your neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes now, he says, he dreams that he is being arrested, but
he's not sure for what. ``Not for Kosovo, but because of the
protests, or because I owe money for electricity or whatever,'' he
says. ``But it's a horrible feeling of insecurity, and for all the
reservists it's the same.''
</P>
<P>
   They talk to each other; they go fishing. ``This is like the
golden age of fishing,'' he said. ``It's the cheapest form of
entertainment and escape from reality,'' he said. ``Really, a
perfect escape.''

EARLY PROBE DISCOUNTS MECHANICAL FAILURE IN KENNEDY CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal investigators picking through the wreckage of the single
engine plane in which John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and
sister-in-law died last week, have found no sign of mechanical or
structural problems and no indication of fire on board the
airplane, two highly placed aviation sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators are still months away from pinpointing the
cause of the crash, and one source warned it would ``be premature
and irresponsible'' to say the focus has shifted to determine if
Kennedy, who was at the controls that night, may have committed an
error which sent the plane into the ocean off the coast of Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely unlikely that further scrutiny of the crash
would reveal a mechanical or structural problem in the Piper
Saratoga, one source said.
</P>
<P>
   The engine is being dismantled under National Transportation
Safety Board supervision by Textron Lycoming, the manufacturer, but
the preliminary examination indicates the 300-horsepower engine was
working when the six-passenger plane slammed into the water,
killing Kennedy, his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister,
Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   However, investigators have not completed a review of the
plane's electrical system or the avionics, which include its
navigational instruments and auto-pilot, one source said. That
review could take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, investigators are unwilling to single out pilot
error as the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a novice pilot, was at the controls of a newly
purchased, high-performance airplane in a flight from Fairfield,
N.J., to Martha's Vineyard last Friday, en route to a cousin's
wedding in Hyannis Port the next day.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:39 p.m., about an hour into his flight and less than 20
miles from the Martha's Vineyard airport, Kennedy's plane vanished
from air-traffic control radar screens. After a four-day search,
the wreckage was found about seven miles off the coast of Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a tell-tale sign of mechanical problems _ and the
detailed radar tapes which show the plane twice veered off course
from Martha's Vineyard and then plunged into a steep dive _
indicate that Kennedy most likely became disoriented as the plane
turned, and did not realize the plane was headed down until it was
too late.
</P>
<P>
   When a plane turns, the wings bank and the speed of the air
flowing over the upper wing increases. That imbalance, left
uncorrected, will cause the plane to tilt even more steeply. The
steeper the bank, the less lift there is in the wings, and the
plane begins to descend.
</P>
<P>
   On a dark night, flying over water with haze restricting
visibility, Kennedy may not have been able to see the horizon which
would have indicated to him that the plane was not in level flight.
'
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was licensed as a VFR, or visual flight rules, pilot. As
such, he was trained only to fly by what he could see, and was
grounded when flight visibility was less than three miles or the
cloud ceiling was at 1,000 feet or lower.
</P>
<P>
   But one source bristled at the suggestion that Kennedy used poor
judgment when he decided to fly that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is premature to state anything about the cause,'' the
source said. ``There have been a lot of reports that he failed to
get a weather update and we know that he called (the Federal
Aviation Administration) at 6:30 and got a weather update and in
that there was nothing that would indicate trouble for a VFR pilot
on takeoff or en route.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his death, Kennedy was attempting to become certified to
fly by instruments only and had passed the written portion of the
examination, but had yet to take the practical examination. In many
countries, VFR pilots are not allowed to fly at night and the US
military trains all its pilots to fly by instruments by the time
they leave flight school.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB investigators, reviewing Kennedy's flying time, have found
he had more than 300 hours in the air, much of that as a student
pilot. ``We are still counting, but it is much more than 100 hours
or so that was in several reports,'' a source said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, FAA officials said Kennedy had just 47 hours of
flying time, but that was an outdated figure listed on a change of
address form and entered into a computer, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy bought the Piper in April, a year after getting his
private pilot's license. According to the previous owner, the
airplane had 575 hours of flying time when Kennedy took possession.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB has said at the time of the crash, the plane had 622
hours of flying time, which would indicate that Kennedy had about
48 hours of flying time in the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, television news stations reported that Lauren
Bessette had purchased an electronic ticket for a Continental
Airlines flight leaving from Newark the night of the crash, but she
never showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Other television stations have also broadcast the same report,
some of them attributing the information to Continental. Michelle
King, an airline spokeswoman, said she has heard the report but
would not confirm it because passenger records are confidential.
</P>
<P>
   She said the last flight from Newark to Martha's Vineyard the
night of the crash was scheduled to leave at 8:15 p.m. but was
delayed an hour and 40 minutes due to weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   As for the TV report, King said, ``I have no idea where they're
getting that from.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders Tuesday night set a
two-week deadline to determine if the Palestinians would accept the
new prime minister of Israel's proposal to rewrite the time-frame
and terms of the most recent peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second meeting in 16 days between Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, and Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, and
the tone had changed considerably. The bonhomie of their first
encounter, which was meant to establish rapport, gave way to the
polite hardball of their first real negotiating session.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking late Tuesday night at the Erez checkpoint in Gaza,
Arafat repeated, almost word-for-word, the demands he had made
after their first meeting. He sounded as if he would in no way
consider Barak's request to delay compliance with some parts of the
most recent agreement, the so-called Wye River memorandum, an
American-brokered land for security deal concluded last fall in Wye
River, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a frank meeting,'' Arafat said. ``I told Prime
Minister Barak that it is very necessary to immediately begin full
implementation of the Wye agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinian leader did agree Tuesday to take 14 days to
consider through lower-level talks if there was something to gain
by doing things Barak's way. Palestinian officials have said it is
difficult for them to see anything in Barak's request but a
reluctance to concede territory.
</P>
<P>
   Barak did make it clear that if the Palestinians rejected his
proposal, he will be prepared to carry out the Wye agreement as
written. ``Any change made to the agreement will be made only by
the consent of both parties,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   As they met behind closed doors at the Erez checkpoint _ a kind
of neutral zone between Israel and Palestinian-controlled Gaza _
Barak outlined his thinking to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Barak would prefer to transfer the West Bank territory promised
under Wye in a piecemeal fashion as talks get under way for the
outlines of a final peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Wye agreement troop withdrawal occurs in three phases;
Israeli troops withdrew from the first chunk of land last fall and
Barak is reportedly willing to withdraw from the second in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak has said the third transfer of territory would create
a volatile situation in the West Bank, leaving 15 settlements like
islands _ and sources of friction _ within Palestinian-controlled
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Such friction could lead to bloodshed, which would jeopardize a
successful negotiation of the final peace, Barak has said.
Terrorism would halt the negotiations, he has said. And Tuesday
night, he repeated that thought to the Palestinians, encouraging
them, with a touch of warning, to be what he sees as far-sighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event that we decide not to make these adjustments we
have requested, of course both sides will understand with open eyes
what risks are entailed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have said that Barak aspires to start final
status negotiations, which will deal with the thorniest issues,
such as borders, the status of Jerusalem, and refugees, within a
month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barak never liked the incremental approach established by the
Oslo peace accords, which set the path for baby steps toward a
final peace by allowing time for trust to be built between the two
sides. He has said he thinks it is backwards to give up land before
discussing the final borders of the Palestinian entity.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is reportedly willing to take some concrete steps, like
releasing Palestinian prisoners, establishing a safe passage route
between Gaza and the West Bank, and allowing the start of
construction on a port in Gaza. He is also reportedly considering
offering more than the Wye agreement demands in certain areas and
making certain critical concessions within the context of the final
status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Haaretz newspaper reported Tuesday that Barak,
during final peace talks, might be willing to discuss transferring
those West Bank settlements that would end up as islands within
Palestinian-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
   During the next two weeks, Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian
negotiator, and Gilad Schar, an Israeli lawyer and brigadier
general who handled Barak's negotiations to form a coalition
government, will meet to hammer out the issues involved in carrying
out the Wye agreement, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   At Erez Tuesday night, Arafat may have given a signal of what
would be his pre-condition for plunging immediately into final
status talks, before Wye was fully carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have asked the prime minister to cease all settlement
activities, which are illegal and destructive to the peace process,
so we can resume final status negotiations,'' Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   Since territory is of vital importance to the Palestinians, the
issue of new Jewish settlements staking out acreage in the West
Bank is one of the biggest thorns in their sides.
</P>
<P>
   They were reassured when Israeli army troops dismantled an
illegal settler outpost near Ramallah last week; such actions were
not taken under Benjamin Netanyhau, the former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian demands go beyond one-time actions. They want to
see Barak take down other encampments that have cropped up since
the Wye Accord was signed in Maryland last fall, and to suspend
plans to develop the land connecting the largest settlement, Maale
Adumim, to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   These are steps that Barak is unlikely to take in the immediate
future, since they would provoke strong right-wing protest and
upset the political balance within Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat said he had pledged to ``beef up'' security cooperation
with the Israelis and ``within the framework of trilateral
cooperation'' with the Americans and the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are anxious about establishing momentum with
Barak before he gets entangled in restarting negotiations with
Syria. Judging from the messages passing back and forth between
Israel and Syria, through intermediaries like King Abdullah of
Jordan, those talks could get underway very soon.
</P>
<P>
   While Barak has said that he will negotiate on both tracks at
once, the Palestinians fear that they will not get priority.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Barak said, ``I still think that within 15
months, we will know in which of the tracks _ Palestinian, Syrian,
Lebanese _ we will have a break-through and we will move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, seemingly catching himself, he added: ``Without any
preference, any priority to any one.''

U.S. STARTS TO FLY EAGER KOSOVO REFUGEES BACK HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The State Department, having flown more than 10,000 refugees
from Kosovo to the United States, is now offering to fly them back
home _ and is being inundated with requests.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 calls a day have been coming in to a toll-free
number _ (800) 748-4521 _ that was set up to answer questions about
the program, which was announced two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to hire a second Albanian-speaking operator and install
extra telephone lines to roll over into voice mail to handle the
volume,'' said Lauren Engle, a spokeswoman for the International
Organization for Migration, which is managing the return under
contract to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The group has already processed applications from 748 families
to return. At an average of five members for each family, that
would account for more than a third of the refugees here, although
Ms. Engle said many families had eight or nine members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, with the program only two weeks old, it's just
surprising that you would get that many applications,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The desire of the refugees to return to Kosovo echoes the
experience in the camps in Albania and Macedonia when tens of
thousands of refugees a day swept back into Kosovo on the heels of
NATO troops, despite the urging of U.N. relief officials, who
expected them to remain for three weeks or more.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department program brought 10,513 refugees to the
United States from the camps, where they had fled a campaign by
Yugoslav forces to drive them from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The program was intended primarily to relieve pressure on
Macedonia, where the exodus had brought ugly scenes at the border,
with the police clubbing refugees back or holding them in rough
encampments. Macedonia, poor itself, was ill-equipped to handle the
refugees, and some authorities feared they would join the Albanian
minority there to destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
   The usual policy of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees is to try to keep refugees close to the border in order to
speed their eventual return.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation in Macedonia deteriorated so quickly that by
April 6, not quite two weeks after the outward flood began, 29
other countries were enlisted to take in refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The first flight to the United States, where the refugees were
processed through the old army base at Fort Dix, N.J., was on May
5.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. commission met in Geneva, Switzerland, this month with
representatives of the 29 countries to discuss the return. The new
American policy was announced shortly after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The first return chartered flight, with 289 people aboard, left
New York Monday. After landing in Skopje, the Macedonian capital,
the refugees went by bus to Pristina, Kosovo. Most are expected to
stay in Pristina, the provincial capital, but some are to be sent
to home towns in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   When the refugees were first brought here, each family had to
promise to pay eventually for the voyage, at an average cost of
$3,000. If a family returns to Kosovo by May 1, 2000, this debt
will be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   There are still some refugees being flown to the United States
under the original program, the State Department said, mostly
vulnerable cases like people with medical problems or elderly
people without immediate family support.

   NUTS &AMP; BOLTS: Wake up your lawn with cool drink of water
</P>
<P>
   By James Cummings
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Lawns tend to go dormant through the hottest part
of the summer, so your yard is probably showing lots of brown spots
unless you have been regularly watering.
</P>
<P>
   When grass plants become stressed _ through cold, lack of sun or
dryness _ their strategy is to go dormant. The blades above ground
turn brown and shrivel while the roots stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   Watering your grass avoids the lawn's normal midsummer dormancy
period and keeps it green until cooler, wetter weather arrives in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In periods of average rainfall, like we're in now, you probably
should be watering the lawn every seven to 10 days. But when it's
hot and dry, you may need to water twice as often. Grass dries out
fastest when temperatures are high, relative humidity is low and a
gentle breeze is blowing.
</P>
<P>
   A light watering may be worse than no watering at all because it
can distort the roots of the grass plants. Apply enough water to
wet the ground to a depth of six to eight inches. If you have the
thick clay soil most common in this area, that will take up to an
inch of water. Sandy soils take less water, but must be watered
more often.
</P>
<P>
   Place a few open containers around the yard under the sprinkler.
Monitor the containers to see how long it takes to accumulate an
inch of water. The day after watering, dig a hole or drill a soil
core and check to see how far the water you applied has penetrated.
If the penetration is less than six inches, run the sprinkler
longer the next time.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to water the lawn is early in the morning,
preferably just before the sun comes up. That way the lawn gets a
good soaking, but when the sun rises it quickly burns off the
excess surface water.
</P>
<P>
   You can also water in the evenings if mornings are inconvenient.
Avoid watering during the hot afternoon hours when much of the
water you sprinkle will evaporate. And don't water after dark;
leaving moisture in the grass plants overnight promotes fungal
growth.
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky enough to have an automatically timed sprinkler
system, 5 or 6 a.m. is a good time to start.
</P>
<P>
   Manual sprinklers come in two types: oscillating sprinklers that
spray in a fan pattern over a rectangular area, and pulsating or
impact sprinklers that spray a stream over a circular or
wedge-shaped area.
</P>
<P>
   Oscillating sprinklers cost from about $5 to $45 and generally
do an adequate job. But some experts say impact sprinklers provide
more even coverage more quickly. They cost $5 to $25.
</P>
<P>
   The International Society of Arboriculture, an association of
tree-care professionals, said inadequate water supply is usually
the major reason a tree fails to grow to its greatest potential.
</P>
<P>
   The group says leafy trees and shrubs may be suffering from
water deprivation if they show wilting leaves, green leaves that
fall off the trees in drought periods, and leaves that turn brown
or yellow or develop scorched-looking edges.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of water may damage the tree directly or it may weaken the
tree, making it more vulnerable to insects and diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Established trees and woody shrubs may need a good soaking about
once a week if the weather has been hot and dry, though they
usually can withstand the heat if they've gotten adequate rainfall.
Trees planted last fall or more recently may need to be watered
twice a week during dry spells.
</P>
<P>
   It's important not to overwater because excessive water keeps
roots from getting the air they need. If you're not sure if it's
time to water, turn a spadeful of soil to check for moisture a
couple of inches down.
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors determining how often you should water is the
soil around the tree. Clay soil in a depression will hold water
much longer than sandy soil on a hilltop, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Trees and shrubs aren't watered the same way grass is watered.
Grass is watered in a wide pattern with fine spray; the soil around
trees should be soaked, but the foliage should be kept dry.
</P>
<P>
   The best tool for watering trees is a soaker hose. A soaker hose
is porous, and when it is placed on the ground and attached to a
water supply, the water oozes steadily through the body of the
hose, delivering the water to the soil exactly where you want it.
</P>
<P>
   An ordinary garden hose also can be used to water trees. Place
the hose on the ground and turn on a gentle flow. Move the hose
often to spread the water around the tree or shrub's boundary. You
should water out as far as the tree's foliage extends because a
tree's root system usually is the same size as the tree's crown.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the best time of day to water is early in the morning.

NO RED CARPET IN FALKLANDS FOR ARGENTINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Before the ink was even dry, President
Carlos Saul Menem called his recent agreement with Britain to allow
Argentine tourists to visit the Falkland Islands for the first time
since the 1982 Falkland war ``the crown jewel'' of his 10 years in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Overjoyed by his self-proclaimed diplomatic victory, Menem said
his daughter, Zulema, would be on the first commercial flight
between Argentina and the Falklands in October. He said he would
soon follow, hinting that he might even make it to the South
Atlantic archipelago before his term ends in December as a
victorious swan song.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said he
wanted to go. After sending Christmas cards to the islanders in
recent years as part of his ``charm offensive,'' Di Tella said he
had new friends to visit.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks after the initial hoopla, the agreement has not
turned out to be everything Menem had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   His handpicked vice president, Carlos Ruckauf, has sharply
criticized the pact for obliging visiting Argentines to carry
passports _ an explicit recognition that the archipelago is foreign
soil and not Argentine as stated in the constitution. And the first
Argentine journalists reporting from the islands have written that
many of the 2,400 residents, as one front-page headline in Clarin
put it, ``fear a flood of Argentines.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been several small but nasty demonstrations against
the agreement, including one in which a few hundred islanders
burned an Argentine flag and threw stones at the house of a local
official who supported the negotiations that produced the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the disturbances, the British governor on the islands
gave an interview to Clarin warning high-placed Argentines to stay
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere in the islands is such that it would be asking
for problems and hostility toward the visitors,'' the governor,
Donald Lamont, told Clarin. ``I don't want to sound negative but
there are people with very strong opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Summers, who was one of two Falkland representatives who
helped negotiate the agreement, told an Argentine radio station
that Di Tella and Miss Menem ought to postpone their visits because
``there are still angry feelings in the Falklands toward the
Argentines.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Argentine officials have let it be known that the
president and Di Tella would probably not be setting foot in the
Falklands anytime soon, even if Miss Menem continues to insist she
is going.
</P>
<P>
   Menem told reporters he may send Tourism Secretary Francisco
Mayorga in place of Di Tella. Mayorga's visit would be a message
that the islanders stand to gain monetarily from better relations
with Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   As some of the most vocal islanders see it, the agreement is a
Trojan Horse that will lead to an eventual Argentine conquest. The
agreement, which does not settle the sovereignty issue, opens
commercial air travel between Argentina and the islands and pledges
Argentine-British cooperation in clearing land mines left behind
from the 1982 war.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published last week in The Penguin News, a weekly paper
distributed in Port Stanley, reported that 56 percent of the
islanders oppose the commercial air link that will bring Argentines
to the Falklands.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina has claimed the islands ever since a British force
overwhelmed a small Argentine constabulary there in the 1830s.

 &HT;    Falcons' drive for NFC repeat begins in S.C.
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ With all but one player showing up today for
Thursday's start of training camp, Falcons coach Dan Reeves and his
staff face a different kind of pressure this year.
</P>
<P>
   They lost a softball game to members of the media on the eve of
last year's camp at Suwanee, and Reeves was crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, every man has his superstitions, and he's wondering
if perhaps the one-run loss was a good thing. The staff whipped the
media the previous season, but the Falcons went 7-9.
</P>
<P>
   After Reeves turned in six erratic innings on the mound last
year, the Falcons went 16-3, setting a slew of franchise records
before hitting Denver's windshield with a splat in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take losing (the softball game) again if it means we turn
around and have a season something like last year,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   And so the softball game at 1 p.m. today at Furman University
will end the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' drive to repeat as NFC champions then begins in
earnest. More than the site of the training camp has changed.
``Last year our goal was to make the playoffs,'' Reeves said.
``This year, it is to defend the (NFC West) title. If you start
thinking about getting back to the Super Bowl, you kind of
overshoot things.''
</P>
<P>
   All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson will be the missing player
as he begins a holdout while contract extension talks continue.
</P>
<P>
   But Pro Bowl cornerback Ray Buchanan, who talked by phone with
Anderson a few days ago, said when practice begins at 3 p.m.
Thursday, everybody will be focused nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Anderson) . . . wanted to find out how thing were going with
the team,'' Buchanan said. ``I told him, `We're rooting for you to
get it done, but we can't wait for you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more fun for the rest of us (to show up for camp) when
we're trying to hold our ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will practice twice Friday and may practice twice
Saturday, too, as they build toward an Aug. 8 scrimmage against
Jacksonville at Furman, and an Aug. 13 exhibition game against
Detroit in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a few questions in camp.
</P>
<P>
   Will right guard Gene Williams keep his job? Will the team make
a move to youth and install second-year man Bob Hallen?
</P>
<P>
   At left guard, can Calvin Collins hold off newly acquired Greg
Bishop? Will Bishop move to the right side?
</P>
<P>
   On defense, who will start at the corner opposite Buchanan,
Ronnie Bradford, or Michael Booker? And is it possible Bradford
will change positions and displace Pro Bowl free safety Eugene
Robinson?
</P>
<P>
   The team also may seek a proven deep threat at wide receiver to
replace Tony Martin, who was waived in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Today's first question: Will coaches tank the softball game?
Then the questions get serious.

ARAFAT TO CONSIDER ISRAELI DELAY OF LAND TRANSFERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israelis and Palestinians got down to hard
bargaining Tuesday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
reluctantly promising to consider an Israeli plea to delay land
transfers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-hour meeting at a crossing separating Israel from
the Gaza Strip, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he expects
Arafat to give an answer within two weeks. In essence, the Israelis
want the Palestinians to agree to delay land transfers called for
by the Wye River agreement until a comprehensive peace deal is
negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's willingness to consider Barak's suggestion was widely
seen as the beginning of a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that by postponing the handover of some West Bank
land to the Palestinians, Barak hopes to avoid a confrontation with
Jewish settlers and with members of the pro-settlement parties
belonging to his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   However, Arafat maintained in public that Israel should
implement the agreement ``accurately'' and ``immediately.``
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said that he is committed to the Wye River accord,
under which Israel pledged to give the Palestinians 13 percent of
the West Bank in stages. He said Tuesday that if, after two weeks,
Arafat still refuses to go along with a delay, Israel would
implement the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to Wye,'' the prime minister said. ``Any
changes to the agreement will be made only by the consent of both
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Wye land transfers are implemented, about 15 West Bank
settlements will become isolated islands in a sea of
Palestinian-ruled territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Barak) thinks that the internal upheaval that may be caused
by these isolated settlements is not worth the progress in the
peace process,'' said Chemi Shalev, a political commentator for the
daily newspaper Maariv.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to tell Arafat, `Why should we create a dangerous
situation which begs violence?''' Shalev said. ``Then, if we don't
reach an agreement by a certain date, we'll carry out the Wye
accords.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians have reacted with suspicion since Barak began
talking about postponing land transfers when he entered office
three weeks ago. They say his appeal amounts to an attempt to keep
the land and use it as a future bargaining chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Israeli suggestion is making the Palestinian leaders
nervous,'' said Palestinian analyst Ghassan Khatib, who directs a
Jerusalem-based media center. ``It signals a lack of commitment to
signed agreements, which was their main problem with the previous
prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalev and other Israeli analysts said they expected Barak to
allay these Palestinian concerns by offering them a series of
gestures as an indication of goodwill, including the quick handover
of around 5 percent of what one analyst termed ``quality''
territory now.
</P>
<P>
   The ``quality'' territory would apparently include swaths of
land in the northern West Bank contiguous to areas already under
Palestinian control rather than territory in the Judean Desert in
the southern West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Wye accords, 3 percent of the desert land near the
southern town of Hebron was to come under Palestinian rule but
remain an undeveloped ``nature reserve.``
</P>
<P>
   To sweeten the proposal, these analysts predicted that Barak
would offer to release Palestinian prisoners, open a long-awaited
``safe passage'' that would let them to travel freely between the
West Bank and Gaza, and allow initial work to begin on a deep-water
seaport in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The port and the safe passage route are particularly important
to Arafat because both would provide a much-needed lift to the
Palestinian economy. The economy has been hit hard by Israeli
restrictions that, among other things, prevent Palestinians from
easily crossing from Gaza to jobs in Israel. The restrictions were
imposed as part of an Israeli drive to increase security.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians say the expect the Israelis to implement all the
gestures, as well as the land transfers, because past agreements
call for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely Arafat will be happy to see these parts of the
agreement to be implemented,'' said Khatib. ``But he also expects
the other parts to be implemented, including the redeployments.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most analysts predict Arafat would ultimately find a way
to accommodate the Israeli request. President Clinton, eager to see
negotiations revived, has asked the Palestinian leader to consider
Barak's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's last meeting with Arafat on July 11 was marked by a show
of warmth on both sides. After those talks, Barak and Arafat
praised one another's leadership and promised to work together for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the atmosphere of Tuesday's meeting was noticeably
cooler, but it was still warmer than the meetings of Barak's
predecessor, hard-liner Benjamin Netanyahu, had with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu fulfilled the first phase of Wye, a withdrawal from 2
percent of the West Bank, but suspended the pact in December,
charging that the Palestinians had reneged on their security
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli analysts said the Palestinians are trying to win Barak's
goodwill at this early stage. The Palestinians are mindful that an
Israeli breakthrough in parallel negotiations with Syria over the
Golan Heights could undercut their negotiating position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians have to make sure they are not being
cheated,'' said one Israeli analyst. ``On the other hand, they have
a very great interest in securing the good will of Barak. They have
to chart their course between these two necessities.''

couple of relatively simple strategies: buying big-name companies
whose products they knew or use and piling into stocks that have
already been big winners. But no investment trend lasts forever.
And recently, these strategies appear to be losing steam. By

FINDING A METAPHOR FOR LIFE IN A TRIP TO A FUNERAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo of Patrice Chereau is being sent to NYT photo
clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
(888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1)  
 (af)  
 Leslie Camhi's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
the Belgian director Patrice Toye.  
 By LESLIE CAMHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Part enfant terrible and part national treasure, Patrice Chereau
has built a formidable reputation in France, with three decades of
groundbreaking work in theater, opera and, increasingly, film. His
latest movie, ``Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train,'' had just
had its premiere at the Cannes International Film Festival last
year when Chereau went out to buy a book in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clerk asked what my plans were,'' Chereau recalls. ``I
told her I was preparing another film. `No more theater?' she said.
`What a pity.' Well, her comment ruined my day.''
</P>
<P>
   That momentary disappointment is unlikely to stop Chereau, who
has a long habit of confounding expectations. His iconoclastic
interpretation of Wagner's ``Ring'' cycle, set at the dawn of the
industrial era rather than in a remote Teutonic past, was greeted
with howls when it opened at the Bayreuth Festival in 1976; now it
is hailed as a landmark production.
</P>
<P>
   The Theatre des Amandiers, an experimental theater lab and drama
school he ran for much of the following decade, made the Parisian
suburb of Nanterre an international destination.
</P>
<P>
   His interpretation of ``In the Loneliness of the Cotton Fields''
_ a play for two characters by the French author Bernard-Marie
Koltes, which Chereau performed in and directed at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music in 1996 _ combined a singular dramatic intensity
with Proust's sense of language, Beckett's existential anguish and
the harsh passion of Jean Genet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 53, Chereau has decided to devote himself to film, a
medium in which he still feels like a beginner, even with seven
titles to his credit. These include ``L'Homme Blesse'' (``The
Wounded Man,'' 1983), about an adolescent's homosexual awakening in
the sordid underbelly of a provincial train station, and ``Queen
Margot,'' a lavish 1994 production, starring Isabelle Adjani and
based on the Alexandre Dumas novel about a 16th-century French
royal family, a story rife with incest, deception, massacres and
poisonings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train,'' which opens Wednesday,
also focuses on a nasty bit of Parisian infighting _ this time,
though, in the milieu of a demanding gay painter, Jean-Baptiste
(Jean-Louis Trintignant), who has just died. The film measures his
effect on a series of characters _ relatives and hangers-on,
colleagues and ex-students, current and former lovers, their wives
and children _ who come together for a four-hour train ride from
Paris to Limoges, where Jean-Baptiste will be buried.
</P>
<P>
   It's an extended meditation on paternity in its many forms,
biological and spiritual, on mourning and survival. Yet it's full
of life's vital agitation.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the script came from Daniele Thompson, a co-writer
for both ``Queen Margot'' and ``Those Who Love Me,'' who attended
the provincial funeral of a Parisian friend three years ago. The
dying man had asked to be buried in Limoges, the city of his birth.
When friends objected to the city's distance from the capital, he
responded with the phrase that forms the film's title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very prideful thing to say,'' Chereau said by
telephone from Corsica where he was vacationing before traveling to
New York for the film's opening. ``Because it means, if you love
me, you can very well sacrifice a day of your life to accompany my
body. And it also means, we'll see that day who's on the train and
who isn't. I suppose we all wonder what the day we're buried will
be like. But it's an error of vanity to think you can control it in
any way. You can't direct your own funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to draw parallels between the charismatic
director and the imperious figure of Jean-Baptiste, the deceased
artist. Chereau says that character was modeled partly on his own
father, a painter named Jean-Baptiste.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, bits of Chereau's experience are reflected in the
various characters arriving at the Austerlitz train station early
one morning: in the love triangle that develops brusquely between
Francois, an art critic (Pascal Greggory), his boyfriend Louis
(Bruno Todeschini) and Bruno, a young boy (Sylvain Jacques); in the
haggard disputes between Jean-Marie (Charles Berling), the dead
man's nephew, and Claire, his estranged wife (Valeria
Bruni-Tedeschi); in the elderly colleagues, and the little girl who
glimpses her father driving a station wagon carrying the corpse
along a road that parallels the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these people, with their problems and bad moods, running
late, in a hurry, arguing, they push themselves onto the train, the
door closes, and it's like putting them in a pot to cook for four
hours,'' Chereau explains with amusement. ``It can only explode.''
</P>
<P>
   The train comes to a stop at Limoges, a city of 140,000
inhabitants, where 185,000 lie buried in a vast cemetery. The
sudden sight of this sea of graves is a visceral reminder that the
journey's fights, gossip, longings and confusion are the stuff of
life.
</P>
<P>
   In a discussion of influences, Chereau cites sources as diverse
as ``King Lear'' and Lawrence Kasdan's 1983 film, ``The Big
Chill.'' Mostly, though, his film was informed by his own knowledge
of funerals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes an interment is like an incredible jolt of
electricity,'' he said. ``The pain at the cemetery is terrible. But
bizarrely enough, I've sometimes seen an explosion of vitality and
energy an hour or two later. People drink, eat, begin to laugh.
Afterwards the pain returns. But life asserts itself. It's a kind
of animal reaction, very deep and strong, to tell yourself, now
life is before you, and you mustn't ruin it.''
</P>
<P>
   His film also is about a teacher's legacy. Like Jean-Baptiste,
Chereau has helped form a generation of students, several of whom
appear in ``Those Who Love Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a tuning fork, he sounded the true note, against which I
measure the rest of my career,'' said Ms. Bruni-Tedeschi, a rising
star in French and Italian film, who studied acting at the Theatre
des Amandiers more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   What's it like to work with Chereau? ``He's a pusher, he takes
you places where you wouldn't normally go,'' said the actor Vincent
Perez. In ``Those Who Love Me,'' Perez plays Viviane, a
transsexual, a role that is a radical departure for a young French
star more often cast as the dashing lead in historical romances
like ``Cyrano'' and ``Queen Margot.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chereau _ who has played Napoleon (in Youssef Chahine's
``Adieu, Bonaparte''), the French revolutionary Camille Desmoulins
(in Andrzej Wajda's ``Danton'') and the legendary Resistance leader
Jean Moulin (in Claude Berri's new wartime drama, ``Lucie Aubrac,''
which opens Aug. 20) _ doesn't see himself as a commanding
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I arrive in the morning,'' Chereau said, ``I look at the
set, I listen to the actors, and I know immediately what I
(italics)don't(end italics) want. But I don't necessarily know what
I (italics)want.(end italics) When you're young, you have a certain
vision that you want to impose. I've learned to search for
something unexpected, and closer to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Years of work in opera have helped to shape his sense of
cinematic rhythm. ``Film is an entirely musical experience,'' he
said. ``In editing, you count time, you establish a partition and
different rhythms.''
</P>
<P>
   But the camera allows viewers a physical proximity and intimacy
with actors that is impossible to achieve on the stage. ``I've made
a lot of films in my life,'' he noted, ``that no one has seen but
myself _ during theatrical rehearsals, when I'm very close to the
actors, and I watch emotions flit across their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Chereau wants to use movie-making to compose a portrait of
contemporary reality. ``I want my work to pose questions about how
people live today,'' he said. ``Is it normal that they live that
way? Why do they get along so badly?''
</P>
<P>
   This last question should resonate deeply in Chereau's next
project, a film adaptation of ``Intimacy,'' Hanif Kureishi's
shattering novel about the end of a relationship, which provoked a
storm of controversy in England last year, appearing just after the
writer's own bitter breakup with a longtime girlfriend. Kureishi is
collaborating on the screenplay, which also draws upon a story from
his collection, ``Love in a Blue Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be about a man who finds himself alone, and has
difficulty forming relationships, and falls in love with a woman
whom he doesn't really know, and who doesn't really speak to him,''
Kureishi said on the telephone from London. ``And they try to have
a relationship without feeling or emotional contact.''
</P>
<P>
   If that description recalls the bleak universe of Chereau's late
collaborator, the French playwright Bernard-Marie Koltes, a world
of dark passion and few characters, don't be too certain. It's just
the next step in an artistic career marked by relentless forward
motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always moving toward the things I don't know how to do,''
Chereau said. ``I like the fact that in film I have the feeling
that my major work is still before me.''

NEW HEAD OF ISRAEL'S PARLIAMENT MAKES HIS PRESENCE KNOWN

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ First, there were the new rules of decorum that
Avraham Burg, the new speaker, instantly imposed on the Israeli
parliament in an effort to tame the unruly body.
</P>
<P>
   No smoking. No cell phones. No sexual harassment. No turning
one's backside to the dais.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members will not stand with their behinds facing the
speakers,'' Burg decreed, proceeding to quote from the Bible.
``Only of God does it say, `And you saw my backside and not my
face.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the tongue-lashings that Burg meted out to
government ministers who, acting as everybody always has, failed to
show up promptly to answer parliamentary questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ministers won't respect the parliament, the parliament
won't respect the ministers,'' Burg said, denying them the floor.
</P>
<P>
   And finally there were the publicity stunts and
attention-grabbing political events _ like the ground-breaking
meeting in parliament on Monday with Ahmed Qurei, a senior
Palestinian official. These have secured Burg daily coverage in
Israeli newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   All told, it added up to an unusually high-profile start for
Israel's new parliamentary leader. But Burg is fashioning himself
as a sort of super-speaker who intends not only to remake the image
of the rowdy, fractious parliament but also to use his podium as a
personal and political platform.
</P>
<P>
   Burg took office in defiance of Ehud Barak, the new prime
minister, who sought unsuccessfully to block his election. And
Burg, a top-ranking member of Barak's own Labor/One Israel party,
is wasting no time in his effort to assert himself as a political
counterbalance to the prime minister's inclination to concentrate
power in his own hands.
</P>
<P>
   In his inaugural address early this month, Burg pointedly stated
that ``the consensus of the majority is better than the tyranny of
the individual.'' Later, he somewhat disingenuously said he was
making a philosophical point, which was misunderstood as a personal
challenge to the prime minister. But Burg, who had been openly
angry that he was denied a Cabinet position, was well aware of the
message he had communicated.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Barak said they would be able to work together, and
called Burg's election ``a victory for democracy and for the Labor
movement.'' Burg said that he, too, would like to develop a working
relationship with the prime minister, perhaps by using mutual
associates as buffers. But he also noted that there were ``built-in
conflicts between the heads of two branches neither of whom are
weak personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall and voluble, Burg, who is 44 and the father of six
(including two adopted children whose parents were killed in an
accident), is an interesting mix of many strains in Israeli
society.
</P>
<P>
   He is the child of both a Holocaust survivor and a survivor of
the 1929 Arab massacre of Jews in Hebron, where his grandfather was
chief rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   He is a political prince, the son of Yosef Burg, now 90, who
served in parliament for 40 years and retired as the head of the
National Religious Party.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in the bosom of the religious Zionist movement, which
represents the West Bank settlers, he is nonetheless a very liberal
Orthodox Jew and an ardent dove. After the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon in 1982, he got his political start as a leftist activist
in the Peace Now movement, gathering thousands of signatures to
demand the resignation of Ariel Sharon, then the defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   At a demonstration in 1983, he was lightly wounded when a hand
grenade was tossed into the crowd by a right-wing extremist,
killing a student beside him. As ``a witness to political murder,''
in his words, the experience opened his eyes to the dangers of
internal rifts in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Burg was first elected to parliament in 1988 and stepped out of
politics for several years to run the Jewish Agency. Among the
membership of the Labor Party, he has always been popular, one of
the top vote-getters in party primaries. In 1992, he placed third,
and this year, after returning to politics, he placed fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But some Labor Party leaders have found him to be too
self-assured, too independent, self-righteous, and, as Yitzhak
Rabin, the late prime minister, once said, ``an undermining
puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Burg did not come across as lacking in
self-confidence. He sat at the head of a very long conference table
in the speaker's expansive office, which is much more open than the
prime minister's bunker-like office, with sweeping views of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Burg referred to his ``massive political support,'' and asserted
that as a ``free-thinker,'' he is a threat to the political
establishment that likes to conduct business in ``smoke-filled
rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can communicate individually with every Israeli,'' said
Burg, who is a good public speaker. ``That is a very powerful and
threatening tool. Also, I am never willing to compromise my inner
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, political associates and analysts have
wondered whether Burg was serious or superficial, a loose cannon or
a determined advocate of change.
</P>
<P>
   In his few weeks as speaker, he has alternated moves seemingly
designated to call attention to himself with political gestures
that delivered strong messages about civil rights, peace and the
democratic balance of powers.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Burg sent out a beeper message alerting
photographers to the time of his morning jog and invited them also
to capture him having his blood pressure taken during a
parliamentary health day. (He was declared the fittest among the 60
members of parliament and 140 parliament employees who took part.)
</P>
<P>
   On the other, he ordered all signs in parliament to be made
bilingual in Hebrew and Arabic. And he invited Qurei to visit, and
extended an invitation to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad as well.
</P>
<P>
   His new rules of order for parliament, while mocked by some, are
appreciated by those who agree with his assessment that he
inherited an institution whose authority has been eroded.
</P>
<P>
   ``My responsibility is to upgrade the Knesset again,'' he said,
using the Hebrew term for parliament. ``First, I have to
fanatically defend its independence. It's unhealthy that, with the
expanded government Barak is making, 30 percent of the members of
the Knesset will be ministers or deputy ministers. What is the
executive and what is the legislative?''
</P>
<P>
   With 15 parties represented in parliament, Burg anticipates that
the level of discord could be higher than ever, especially with big
decisions on peace and social issues looming ahead and forcing the
question of what kind of a state the Jewish homeland wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very vivid democracy, but it's very fragile, partly
because of our inner conflict,'' he said. ``What is the real
authority, the Knesset or the Bet Knesset, the synagogue? Are we a
democracy or a theocracy?''

SLUGGISH ECONOMY PRESENTS BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR MOROCCO'S NEW
KING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASABLANCA, Morocco _ In the crowded cobbled alleyways of the
old souk, the young men loitering in doorways and old women selling
tattered wares say they know exactly what they want from Morocco's
new king.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem now is jobs,'' said Hussein Khadoe, 28, who like
many desperate young Moroccans spent years in Europe as an illegal
immigrant and is back home trying to make a living any way he can.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 percent of Moroccans are out of work, even by the
most conservative estimates. About half are illiterate, one of the
highest rates in the region. And a huge debt burden has left the
government with little money to create jobs or provide a social
safety net.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that with the regal pomp and the show of
international support that surrounded the funeral on Sunday for
King Hassan II, the new ruler, King Mohammed VI, was already trying
to convert the good will into more tangible dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi was quoted in Moroccan
newspapers as saying that he had discussed with President Clinton
and others ``the support that Morocco expects from foreign
partners, especially the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Moroccan officials hope that Jordan will provide a model. The
accession there in February of King Abdullah, an untested
37-year-old, has been followed by increases in Western aid and by
warmer relations with neighbors, to help him fend off the
discontent that might spill over into regional instability.
</P>
<P>
   In Morocco, the most surprising helping hand has come from
neighboring Algeria, a longtime rival with which Morocco has long
had border disputes. Among the guests at Hassan's funeral was the
new president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the first Algerian leader to
visit here in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bouteflika signaled that he was prepared to reopen the border,
which was shut in 1994, at a cost to Morocco that economists here
estimates at $2 billion a year in lost trade. In a letter to
Mohammed made public here, the Algerian said he was strongly
committed to move ``hand in hand with your majesty for the
prosperity of our two people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is less clear, however, Western diplomats here said, that the
United States and its allies are ready to welcome Mohammed with a
new influx of aid. For one factor, Morocco is more than 2,000 miles
removed from the epicenter of Arab-Israeli struggles. Despite its
important role in the past as a broker of a wider peace, it is seen
in the West as a less important strategic partner than Jordan, more
than half of whose population is Palestinian and which borders
Israel, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   For another factor, diplomats said, the priority that Morocco
has placed on internal security over economic development may mean
that real obstacles stand in the way of improving its economy. For
now, the second most-powerful man in Morocco, after the king, is
widely said to be Driss Basri, the long-serving interior minister,
and many people doubt that Mohammed would be ready to move him
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Basri is a palace hard-liner who has been accused of widespread
abuses in his 20 years in power. He is widely believed to oppose
further moves toward the democratization that Hassan began
tentatively to embrace in 1986 and that is still sought by the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Without outside help or major internal changes, however,
economists here say Morocco has little room to maneuver. Some 85
percent of government outlays cover salaries and payments on a
foreign debt of $20 billion, among the highest for any Arab
country.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of economic growth, which hit an impressive 6.2 percent
in 1998, is expected to slow to a trickle this year because of a
severe drought. And foreign investment, which hit a record $1.2
billion in 1997, shrank last year to less than half that, in large
part because of investors' doubts about the government's commitment
to a further opening of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Youssoufi, a Socialist who was elected 18 months ago, is
technically in charge of economic policy. But the king has
overarching authority, with the power to dismiss ministers and even
the government. Most people here say if economic conditions are to
improve, the change will have to come from the top.
</P>
<P>
   In Casablanca, the commercial capital, Hassan's most visible
legacy may be the enormous mosque that bears his name. The gleaming
structure that towers over the old city at the edge of the Atlantic
was built in 1990 from $500 million in public contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But the shabby back streets are just as dominant a feature of
this city, like the one where Khadoe practices his trade, usually
by collecting commissions from the small shops to which he tries to
guide the few foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Khadoe said, is in jail, for selling hashish.
Khadoe did that himself for three years that he was illegally in
France, until the police caught him.
</P>
<P>
   Youssoufi was, perhaps, referring to people like Khadoe when he
said, over the weekend, ``We achieved positive results in favor of
our people, but there are still economic and social issues to be
solved.''

HOUSTON MAN WINS $10.2 MILLION IN `ROCKET BELT' TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A judge Tuesday awarded $10.2 million to a Houston man
who claims three others conspired to steal a ``rocket belt'' he
helped develop that could hold one person aloft for about 27
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relieved this phase is over. Hopefully this judgment will
help produce the rocket belt,'' said Thomas L. Stanley, who filed
the suit in 1995 against the three others.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge John Wooldridge also ordered that the
rocket-powered backpack, which has been missing since 1994, be
returned to Stanley. The amount awarded by the judge was more than
three times greater than the $3 million Stanley had asked for.
</P>
<P>
   Wooldridge said just before announcing his judgment that the
two-day trial contained ``evidence of greed, craft, intrigue,
mystery and murder, elements of a cheap novel found on the best
seller's list.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one defendant, attorney Jonette Anderson, showed up for the
trial. Stanley, 54, believes that one of the defendants, Bradley W.
Barker, 44, killed another defendant, Joe Wright, 37, last summer
because Wright had agreed to testify that Stanley's rights to the
machine were improperly taken away.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County sheriff's officials have said Barker is a suspect,
along with another person, who was not identified. Barker filed a
complaint against Harris County sheriff's officials after they
detained him for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Barker insists he is innocent and has phone records proving he
was in Arkansas at the time. He also says he does not know where
the machine is.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was accused of helping draft a phony lien that
transferred ownership of the rocket belt from a company that
Stanley and Barker had formed to a company created by Wright and
Barker.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley's attorney, Michael Von Blon, said all the defendants
will share the damages equally. He said is it unclear how much can
be recovered because Anderson claims to have no assets and Barker's
whereabouts are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Wooldridge awarded $7.5 million for loss of income from the
rocket belt and $2.5 million in punitive damages. The rest was
attorneys' fees and and for a beating that Stanley says Barker gave
him in 1994 with a ball peen hammer after they argued over
finances.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley hooked up with Barker in the early 1990s to develop a
rocket-powered backpack that could keep a person airborne for about
27 seconds, or three seconds longer than similar devices.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket belt, a contraption strapped on like a backpack, is
similar to the one used in the 1965 James Bond movie
``Thunderball.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley and Barker built the machine, called the RB2000, at a
car audio shop owned by Barker's friend, Joe Wright.
</P>
<P>
   The device was last flown publicly at a summer 1995 rally
honoring the Houston Rockets, who were at the time playing for the
NBA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, a few weeks before the case was initially set to go
to trial, Wright agreed to contact Barker and try to find out where
the belt was, according to Wright's former attorney, Ronald Bass.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the body of Wright, 37, was found in his home.
He had been bludgeoned to death.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley testified Monday that other operational rocket belts
typically earn $25,000 per flight, plus expenses. The machines are
powered by hydrogen peroxide and nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   He said there are few such devices in the world that are
operational and that they are difficult to make.
</P>
<P>
   The first rocket belt was developed in the early 1960s by
Wendell Moore, an engineer at Bell Aircraft in Buffalo, N.Y. Built
for the Department of Defense, its 20-second flight duration was
deemed impractical.

 &HT;    U.S., RUSSIA SET NEW TALKS ON REDUCING NUCLEAR ARMS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and Russia agreed Tuesday to
negotiate further reductions in their nuclear arsenals and to
discuss possible U.S. deployment of a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The joint announcement at the White House by Vice President Al
Gore and Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin of Russia followed private
meetings in which the two leaders discussed economic reforms as
well as arms control measures.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement builds on the recent agreement by President
Clinton and Russia's President Boris Yeltsin to begin talks next
month on a new strategic arms reduction treaty (START III) and on
changes to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty to allow
U.S. deployment of a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States and Russia have long understood that
reducing nuclear arsenals is in our mutual interest,'' Gore said in
a statement. ``That is why we will continue to press for
ratification of START II and will begin discussions next month
toward START III.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement referred to a longtime roadblock in the two
nations' arms control talks.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1993 Start II treaty, the United States and Russia agreed
to cut their nuclear arsenals to a maximum of 3,500 warheads by
2003. The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty, but it has languished in
the Russian parliament, and recent strains between the two
countries over the Kosovo conflict are slowing its consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin said the Russian government ``will try to bring Start
II to the Duma (the lower house of Russia's parliament) again in
the fall of this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the two countries will begin discussions on a Start
III treaty in Moscow to reduce the arsenals to as low as 2,000
warheads on each side.
</P>
<P>
   The new talks will also focus on changes the United States wants
in the ABM Treaty that would enable the development of a national
missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is on record as endorsing a defensive shield against
limited missile attack, even though one has not been shown to be
technically feasible. Russia, however, is concerned that such a
system would leave it vulnerable in a nuclear exchange between the
two nations.
</P>
<P>
   While the anticipated arms control measures are considered
relatively modest, the announcement allowed Gore to showcase his
foreign policy credentials and draw a sharp contrast to Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, widely viewed as his chief rival for the
presidency next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a card, a decent card, and Gore ought to play it _ even
though it rarely trumps other cards in a presidential campaign,''
said Charles Cook, editor of the Cook Political Report, an
influential political newsletter in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement also briefly silenced Jim Nicholson, chairman
of the Republican National Committee, who earlier in the day used
Gore's appearances with Stepashin to accuse the Clinton
administration of being ``irresponsible and immoral'' in not
pushing harder for a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``For six years, the Clinton-Gore administration's policy has
been to deliberately leave America vulnerable to a missile attack
by a rogue dictator or a nuclear terrorist,'' Nicholson said in a
statement issued Tuesday morning. He declined comment Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a nuclear arms expert during his congressional career, has
been the Clinton administration's point man in efforts by the White
House to shrink Russia's arsenal of long-range nuclear weapons, the
product of the lengthy Cold War between the United States and what
used to be called the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this new era, strong U.S.-Russian ties will be an essential
component of American national security and global stability,''
said Gore, co-chair of the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission, a panel
created in 1993 to promote nuclear reductions, democracy and a
market economy in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are entering the 21st century _ we have to enter it as
friends,'' said Stepashin, the commission's other co-chair.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of the 1990s, individual investors in the stock market
have become rich by sticking to a couple of relatively simple
strategies: investing in big-name companies whose products they
know or use and piling into stocks that have already been big
winners.
</P>
<P>
   But no investment trend lasts forever. And recently, these
strategies appear to be losing steam. Some of the stocks that have
been the hottest _ companies as diverse as America Online, Pfizer
Inc., Yahoo! Inc., Gillette and Dell Computer _ are down
considerably from their highs of earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these stocks have been outrun by companies few investors
have ever heard of. Indeed, according to Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, in the second quarter of the year, the 100 smallest
companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index rose 26.5
percent while the 100 largest stocks gained only 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy favored by individual investors for the past
five years has also begun to flag: buying so-called index funds
that mirror the returns of the S&AMP;P 500. For the first time in five
years, during the second quarter, millions of index fund investors
found their returns lagging behind those of most money managers who
buy and sell stocks to try to beat the market. At the end of June,
70 percent of professional fund managers were beating the S&AMP;P 500,
more than double the portion that has done so since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   If anything can jolt investors out of their complacency, this
turnabout should, analysts say. ``Buying what you know or where you
used the products and know the brands has been a good strategy,''
said Byron R. Wien, chief U.S. strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. ``In addition to that, the index approach to investing has
worked. But it has pushed valuations of the top 50 stocks in the
S&AMP;P to a very high level. We have finally gotten to the point in
the market where there is a difference between good companies and
good stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past five years or so, good companies and good stocks
have been one and the same, giving investors in blue-chip stocks
annual gains of more than 20 percent each year since 1993, well
above the historical returns of 11 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   But if Wien is correct that these stocks have become overvalued,
investors who have made easy money on them could be in for a shock.
With more do-it-yourself investors in the market than ever, online
and otherwise, it is uncertain how many will recognize that the
investing terrain may have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brokerage firms used to exercise a little oversight, they
wouldn't let something get completely crazy,'' said Shad Rowe, a
principal at Greenbrier Partners, a money management firm in
Dallas. ``Now people are dealing completely on superstition and
price action. And they're having a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of them are confident that the good times will just keep on
rolling. Indeed, an investor-optimism index tracked by Paine Webber
Group Inc., shows investors' expectations for stock returns at
their highest levels ever. The July figures, released Monday,
indicated that individuals who have invested for five years or less
expect the market to return 22.6 percent annually over the next
decade, and 21.1 percent over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   So far the optimists have been right, of course. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average is up 19.58 percent this year, and the S&AMP;P 500
is up 10.87 percent. And in trading Tuesday, some of the technology
stocks that had been beaten down in recent days recovered a bit;
the Nasdaq composite rose 60.14 points, or 2.3 percent. It is up
22.19 percent on the year.
</P>
<P>
   But those moves mask a good deal of investor carnage in some of
the hottest stocks recently. Yahoo! Inc. is down 43 percent from
its April peak, and America Online, while still up 26.6 on the
year, has fallen 42 percent from its high. Dell Computer is down 24
percent from its February high. Even mighty Microsoft is off 11.6
percent from its high of mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the big-name stocks that have been the market's
hottest numbers for five years running _ Gillette, Pfizer and
Merck, to name three _ have actually lost ground for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one quarter's trading action does not necessarily
translate into a long-term trend. Wien of Morgan Stanley believes
that the trend away from the old favorites will continue through
the second half of the year, but other Wall Street strategists see
the shift as evanescent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the simplicity of indexing and buying big-name stocks
appealed to investors. As more and more stock traders followed
suit, prices of the favored companies rocketed. In the first
quarter of 1999, just 18 stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 index accounted for
all of its 6.1 percent gain. These included Cisco Systems, Lucent
Technologies, IBM and America Online. The other 482 companies were
either a wash or a drag on the index.
</P>
<P>
   This narrowly focused performance naturally attracted even more
individuals to the same handful of stocks. And the Internet fueled
the fire. Online traders bought with abandon, pushing prices of the
favored stocks to unheard-of values. Meanwhile, the vast majority
of listed stocks languished.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is the laggards' turn to shine. During the second
quarter, the S&AMP;P 500 rose 6.7 percent while the S&AMP;P Small
Capitalization 600 index, filled with names unfamiliar to most
investors, rose 15.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And in the second quarter, the top-performing industry in the
S&AMP;P 500 was the capital goods group, which consists of makers of
heavy machinery _ not the kind of stock group with which individual
investors have had personal experiences. Ditto for the company that
had the biggest one-month move in the quarter: Marshall Industries,
a distributor of electronic components, whose stock more than
doubled. Marshall is neither a familiar name to most individual
investors nor a stock most would know how to assess.
</P>
<P>
   The invest-in-what-you-know thesis that investors have thronged
to was made famous by Peter Lynch, the extraordinary manager who
brought fame to Fidelity's Magellan Fund in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Berman, a clinical psychologist in Baltimore, became a
do-it-yourself devotee about seven years ago when he was shopping
for a computer and reading computer magazines. ``It seemed like
there were some names that were repeatedly written about as good
companies,'' he recalled. ``I just kept reading about Intel, Dell,
and Cisco, so I started investing in them.'' He said his own picks
in recent years had outperformed the choices of the professional
managers he had consulted in prior years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may have focused on the same relatively small group of
stocks because they felt overwhelmed by information on companies
from both reliable and not-so-reliable sources. The cacophony from
Internet investment chat rooms, increased television coverage of
the markets and countless financial publications contributed to
information overload, prodding some investors to shut out the
clamor and buy the stocks in companies they know best.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the prices of these companies have gotten so out
of whack with their earnings prospects that lesser names are
starting to look like better bets.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the favored Internet and other technology
stocks are still up for the year, their recent slide is a potential
disaster for the thousands of daytraders, some of whom have left
their jobs to play the market. With stocks' daily trading ranges
much more subdued, it has become much tricker to nail down a profit
and much easier to rack up a loss. And who ever thought of
day-trading a steel company or a cement maker? Yet that is what
lies ahead, if the current trend holds.
</P>
<P>
   Cindee H. Sokal is one of the many investors who recently took
up daytrading. A registered nurse for the past 20 years, the mother
of four left her job three months ago and started training for her
new career, then took $50,000 from her family's account at a
full-service broker and began trading it online at a branch of
All-Tech Investments. Although she lost money initially, she is
confident that she will make money. ``I love it. I think it's very
exciting, '' Ms. Sokal said. ``It's where the future is headed.
Initially, you may lose with trial and error but over the long run
you'll reap the rewards of being in touch with it more and aware of
your portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   If the handful of household-name companies continues to lag,
however, investors will have to widen their horizons. This will
make stockpicking much more difficult, forcing them to do the sort
of homework, like examining financial statements, that
old-fashioned money managers have always performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real risk is that investors do nothing, that they become
paralyzed,'' said Elizabeth K. Miller, vice president at Trevor
Stewart Burton &AMP; Jacobsen, a money management firm in New York.
``They won't be participating at the greatest opportunity for
value.''

U.S. SHOULD NOT BECOME INTERNATIONAL POLICEMAN, RUSSIAN OFFICIAL
WARNS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sergei Stepashin, the new prime minister of Russia,
warned on Tuesday that the United States should not assume the role
of international policeman, a sign that relations between the two
countries remain frayed by the American-led military intervention
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, in Washington to meet with President Clinton, Vice
President Al Gore and other American leaders, rejected the notion
of a ``Clinton doctrine'' of intervention in internal conflicts in
sovereign nations. ``It is very dangerous,'' he warned at a
luncheon at the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Stepashin asserted that relations between the
United States and Russia had markedly improved after the severe
chill brought on by the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister announced that the United States and Russia
would open planned talks on a new round of nuclear arms reductions
next month and would consider mutual reductions in the number of
spies in each other's country as a gesture of good will after the
end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin's visit to Washington was his first since he became
prime minister in May. President Boris Yeltsin named him to replace
Yevgeny Primakov, whom Yeltsin accused of moving too slowly on
political and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   His meetings with administration and congressional officials
were designed to mend relations that were strained by the conflict
in Kosovo, which Russia opposed in part because of its historic
ties to Serbia. His visit was also timed to coincide with an
International Monetary Fund board meeting that is expected to
approve on Wednesday a $4.5-billion loan to help stabilize Russia's
floundering economy.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov was scheduled to visit Washington in March but turned
his aircraft around over the Atlantic Ocean to return to Moscow
after Gore told him that the United States was about to begin
bombing Serbian targets in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stepashin's sessions with Gore and Clinton were
described as cordial, deep divisions remain between the two
countries on Kosovo and the United States' view of its role in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin criticized the administration for plotting to remove
the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, from power and for
refusing to provide food and other aid to help rebuild Serbia after
78 days of heavy allied bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is,'' Stepashin said in response to a question after
his luncheon speech, ``there are 10 million people there. Summer is
there, and people are getting by. However, when the winter sets in,
there will be a humanitarian catastrophe in the very heart of
Europe. There are no roads. Enterprises have been destroyed. There
is no gas supply, no water supply in many areas of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has ruled out aid for Serbia as long as Milosevic
remains in power, a position repeated emphatically on Monday by his
national security adviser, Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not provide one penny for reconstruction and we will
not work to bring Serbia into Europe, as we will do with the rest
of the region, so long as an indicted war criminal rules in
Belgrade,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon meeting, Gore and Stepashin talked about
reducing the espionage efforts each country has aimed at the other.
</P>
<P>
   Neither would respond directly to a question on the matter from
a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some questions,'' Gore said at a press briefing on Tuesday
afternoon, ``are best dealt with through completely private
channels.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore acknowledged that ``old attitudes in both countries
fade away slowly,'' leading to over-enthusiastic
intelligence-gathering efforts and bloated spy agency budgets.
``And then the other side has to spend the same amount,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, the former director of Russia's security and
counterintelligence services, confirmed that he and Gore had
discussed the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as states exist, there will always be special
services, intelligence communities,'' Stepashin said in a
man-of-the-world tone. But he added that such ungentlemanly
pursuits should not stand in the way of ``partner-like'' relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   On arms control, Gore and Stepashin reaffirmed a decision
announced last month by Clinton and Yeltsin to open negotiations on
a Start III treaty, even though the Russian Parliament has let six
years pass without ratifying Start II.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed to talk about the United States' desire to
deploy a limited anti-missile defense system that Russia believes
would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty of 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both understand that there are ballistic missile threats we
both face that do not come from each other, but from other
nations,'' Gore said in a statement. ``That is why it is important
_ in parallel with achieving our arms control objectives _ to
discuss implications for the ABM treaty should the United States
decide to deploy a national missile defense.''

 &HT;    Giuliani plays carpetbagger game, visits Clinton's state
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani may be a
Republican, but that didn't stop him from calling up this city's
Democratic mayor Tuesday and telling him what a swell place he
thought Little Rock was.
</P>
<P>
   That was the New York state flag flying above Little Rock's most
historic hotel, after all. Outside the Capital Hotel, the city
government and much of the citizenry was arguing over whether to
rename a 21-block stretch for President Clinton. Inside, however, a
fundraising lunch brought in more than $30,000 for Giuliani's
presumed New York Senate race against first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even the protesters turned out not to be protesters at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some protesters outside, so I felt like I was really
back in New York City,'' Giuliani said about arriving at the
Governor's Mansion here, only to discover that the small crowd
waving signs with messages like ``Razorbacks for Rudy'' were all
fans. ``That doesn't usually happen that people protest in my
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Just another typical day in the race for a senate seat that
won't be decided for 16 months, and yet in which everything already
falls into the ``doesn't usually happen'' category. First Mrs.
Clinton took the unprecedented step of forming an exploratory
committee (no sitting first lady has ever run for a Senate seat,
let alone one in a state where she's never lived), then Mayor
Giuliani began joking that he might run in Arkansas rather than in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   That led to Tuesday's fundraising lunch, as well as a press
conference at the governor's mansion, where Gov. Mike Huckabee
seemed to temporarily forget that he and Giuliani disagree on
abortion, gay rights and numerous other social issues. In fact, the
New York born and raised Giuliani may be downright liberal compared
to Huckabee, a Southern Baptist preacher, but at least he's not
Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that it's an important thing to elect people like
the mayor to maintain a Republican majority,'' said Huckabee, who
made Giuliani an honorary Arkansas citizen on the steps of the
mansion where Hillary Clinton once lived as the state's first lady.
``And also, that people representing their states actually know
what it's like to live there.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, meanwhile, seemed the very essence of a southern
gentleman in discussing his reasons for being in Arkansas. As the
mercury soared near 100 degrees, the large press contingent that
hailed from as nearby as Fayetteville, Ark., and as far away as
London and Tokyo, tried to get the normally cantankerous mayor to
slam Mrs. Clinton or at the very least, his down-home surroundings.
Giuliani merely responded by announcing that he'd placed a call
home ordering that the Arkansas state flag be flown above New
York's City Hall. As for his trip here being a p.r. move, more
specifically a ``jab'' aimed at Mrs. Clinton, Giuliani pretended to
look horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would NEVER do that,'' the mayor said, barely suppressing a
smile. ``That's not in my personality to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but he quickly warmed to it. Asked about the
hotly-debated issue of renaming a street here for President
Clinton, the mayor responded with a barely-concealed swipe at the
first lady and her recent ``listening tour'' of upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I become a candidate in Arkansas, then that's something I
would have a very strong opinion on,'' Giuliani said. ``But right
now, I'm just listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for parts of the day, Giuliani sounded like a
serious-minded candidate, discussing his record on welfare reform
and crime reduction in New York with a group representng the
Greater Little Rock Republican Women's Club.
</P>
<P>
   He also sounded in serious need of cash. With a possible
Republican primary looming, Giuliani will need many millions to
make a serious Senate run -- his two-day Southern swing, which also
included a fundraiser Tuesday night in New Orleans, followed by
three more today in Alabama, should bring in $150,000 to $200,000,
he said at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should run on HIS record,'' said former Arkansas
Gov. Frank White, before heading into the $500-a-plate fundraiser.
``I don't know what record (Hillary Clinton) has that he could
focus on.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was the Hillary factor, more than money and ideas,
that seemed to attract Arkansans to the man from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they weren't exactly from Arkansas themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care for some of his views,'' conceded Ann Barton,
one of several women who'd driven in from Memphis to the governor's
mansion to wave misspelled signs reading ``The Vast Right Wing
Conspiracy (Loves) Rudi.'' ``But we don't think Hillary should run
for the senate from New York, a state where she doesn't even know
the constitutents.''

COMPANY AGREES TO FINANCE FOUNDATION FOR UNINSURED IN CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, N.H., N.J., Mass., R.I.)  (mk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Advancing its campaign to consolidate Blue Cross and Blue Shield
companies in the Northeast, Anthem Inc. agreed Tuesday to finance a
$41 million public health foundation for poor and uninsured people
in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement settled lawsuits filed by state officials and a
coalition of consumer, labor and religious groups after Anthem
merged in 1997 with Connecticut Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the
state's largest health insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem, based in Indianapolis, is also acquiring the Blue Cross
plans in Maine, where it agreed two weeks ago to create a public
foundation valued at about $100 million, and New Hampshire, where
the foundation would be about $80 million, a company spokesman
said. Both deals must be approved by state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Cross-financed foundations, which have ranged from $28
million in Ohio to several billion dollars in California, respond
to laws requiring compensation for tax breaks and subsidies given
to Blue Cross plans over the years. In the biggest example, the
conversion of California Blue Cross by Wellpoint Health Plans, two
foundations received cash and stock valued at $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A merger between Anthem and New Jersey Blue Cross and Blue
Shield two years ago collapsed after the state attorney general
insisted that Blue Cross assets in New Jersey be dedicated to a
foundation and Anthem refused. Anthem has lately been flexible on
the foundation issue, adjusting to varying state laws and policies.
</P>
<P>
   Although each state is unique, the Anthem-financed foundations
are context for a much larger conversion planned by Empire Blue
Cross and Blue Shield in New York. Empire, which says it is about
to report operating profits for the third consecutive quarter, has
been meeting officials of the state attorney general's office and
insurance and health departments to iron out plans to convert to a
for-profit company.
</P>
<P>
   Empire plans to issue stock, all of which would be turned over
to a public foundation. The conversion requires the approval of a
state supreme court. With the settlement in Connecticut, ``Anthem
has decided to take its medicine and pay the bill,'' said Nancy
Wyman, the state comptroller, who joined Richard Blumenthal, the
attorney general, in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem said in a statement that extended litigation would not
have served its policy-holders or taxpayers in Connecticut and
could have affected the company's reputation and goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem, which is a mutual insurance company owned by its
policy-holders, has about 4 million members in Blue Cross plans in
Indiana, Kentucky and southern Ohio, and 1 million more in
Connecticut. Maine Blue Cross has 380,000 members. New Hampshire
Blue Cross has 320,000.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Blue Cross, the biggest in New England, rebuffed
overtures from Anthem and is trying to block a takeover of Blue
Cross of Rhode Island by Anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the New England Blue Cross plans is the biggest health
insurer in its state but they are all financially weak and face
competition from bigger regional companies, including Aetna U.S.
Healthcare, Cigna's Healthsource unit, and the nonprofit Harvard
Pilgrim and Tufts health plans. Kaiser Permanente, the nonprofit
California-based health plan, recently decided to cut its losses in
New England and left the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a tremendous opportunity to take advantage of
efficiencies and economies of scale that consolidations can
create,'' said Jim Parker, a spokesman for Anthem.
</P>
<P>
   In a still unresolved bidding war for Blue Cross of
Colorado/Nevada, which has 500,000 members, Anthem raised its
commitment to establish a $140 million foundation to match a
competing offer by Wellpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Richter, a health care analyst at Banc of America
Securities, said Anthem would have ``a very tough time financing
all the deals.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arun Kumar, an analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's, said Anthem had
a strong balance sheet and a big surplus and could arrange loans if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem reported $178 million in operating income on $5.9 billion
in revenue last year. It had $79 million of operating income in
1997 and $141 million in 1996. With reserves of $1.7 billion,
Anthem has more than twice the reserve level set by the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners, even after setting up
foundations in all the states it hopes to enter, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Wellpoint and Anthem are among the nation's largest Blue Cross
plans, along with Highmark Inc. in Western Pennsylvania, Michigan
Blue Cross, the merged Illinois and Texas Blues plans, and Empire.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Empire said Tuesday that its reserves were
$454.6 million on June 30. Operating income was $13.9 million for
the second quarter of this year, $14.5 million in the first
quarter, and $14.9 million in the last three months of 1998.

THE ART OF THE MOMENT (AND ONLY FOR THE MOMENT)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1)
</HEADLINE>
 (af) 
By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, Italy _ To look at new art is to expect to feel
something or be told something or be tweaked or entertained in ways
that have nothing necessarily to do with tangible objects.
</P>
<P>
   Art less and less is judged by the old priorities of painting,
sculpture and drawing. It is context that increasingly determines
the shape of the art we see. Exhibit No. 1: the 48th Venice
Biennale.
</P>
<P>
   It's commonly being said about the show that video art
dominates, which is true, but only up to a point. There's a
hilarious work, for instance, by Christian Marclay, a young
American, who mixes old film clips of people using the telephone,
and a hypnotic video by Shirin Neshat, a parable about women in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Dieter Roth, the wild German-born recluse who died last year at
age 68, videotaped himself in his studio in 1997 and 1998: ``Solo
Scenes'' presents the tapes he made on 128 monitors that precisely
because they show us nothing remarkable happening, end up being
moving as a record of a private life.
</P>
<P>
   And a rare successful example of video married to sculptural
space comes from Doug Aitken, the Los Angeles artist, whose
Hopperish riff on the city, part hangdog narrative, part hot
technicolor abstraction, set to sound, plays on multiple screens in
a calculated sequence of rooms.
</P>
<P>
   So, there is a lot of video here. But there's no real argument
being made in the biennale for video as the medium of the moment;
different work is brought together on more or less equal ground,
which is how we're supposed to see it. Moving images tend to do
better than static objects in shows like this simply because
they're attention-magnets.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point: we now have a new species of art geared
specifically to the circus environment of the big international
survey show, and video is a part of it. The art happens to
encapsulate the spirit of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Artists having caught on to the nature of these extravaganzas,
their strategy is to accept, rather than fight against, the short
attention span and impatient gaze of people meandering among
hundreds of disparate works. What we get are the visual equivalents
of sound bites, quickly digestible and user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   We might define the '90s as a decade that has rejected the sort
of encompassing movements that used to characterize modern art and
that declared its revolutionary bona fides. Revolutionary ambition
has evidently come to seem a little ridiculous to many young
artists _ the legacy of overreaching expectations and the overhyped
'80s, maybe _ and it has been replaced, in part, by a taste for
spectacle as an end in itself and for art that seems content with
contained, idiosyncratic gestures in any variety of forms and
media.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of work these days _ and this is what you find in
the biennale _ is quirky, accessible and out to please in a low-key
way. I was struck, if not particularly impressed, by artists like
Sarah Sze, Gilles Barbier and others who have made Rube
Goldberg-like sculptures that are just funny contraptions. Max
Dean, a British-born artist living in Toronto, concocted a robot.
It saves or shreds family snapshots he has collected depending on
which button a viewer presses.
</P>
<P>
   In the Czech pavilion, you can get tattooed; in the Spanish
pavilion, you can pose in a giant picture frame and see your
reflection in a mirror. In the Belgian pavilion, you can wander
through a dense white fog. I haven't the vaguest idea what it's
about, but it's perfectly pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   The stance struck is a kind of cheerful detachment,
ideologically speaking neither here nor there _ which explains,
among other things, why no one can claim at the moment to have a
particularly good handle on art. There being no prevailing dogma,
or even the strong desire for one, there is no easy way to grasp an
amorphous situation.
</P>
<P>
   We might regard all this, in one respect, positively: art in the
late '90s is more diverse, inclusive and less dogmatic than it has
been. The cardboard politics and theorizing that were commonplace
have lost their steam. Politics mostly comes in subtler forms now.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Chinese artists in the show (there are a conspicuous
number of them, whose works have been borrowed from a handful of
Swiss owners) is Chen Zhen. He has made drums out of old tables and
chairs. Viewers may bang away on them, perhaps contemplating
political brutality (I'm told it's an intended subtext), but also
just to let off steam.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter much that art academies are still full of
instructors and students spouting arcane ideas to justify what's
meant to pass for art in the classroom. Schools being schools,
they're an easy target. In the real world today, you might say that
the most pesky tendency is the usual obsession with sex _ now
justified, of course, as gender politics _ which can make the art
scene occasionally mimic ``Wayne's World.''
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a lot of prurience at this biennale, and that helps
explain why people seem to like it more than previous ones. It's
curious to be saying that the biennale may actually tell us
something about the state of contemporary art as opposed simply to
the state of those who buy or write about it.
</P>
<P>
   For years, art people have been coming to the show not because
anyone expects it to be good, but because no one can resist the
chance to be here. Reviewers have been writing about the crowds at
the opening and their own surreptitious forays to see older art (as
if an interest in Titian betrayed a lack of faith in what's new),
all of which seemed more interesting than the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the biennale remained a significant occasion nonetheless, if
only because everyone in the art world would definitely be around
in the event that something worthwhile finally happened. And this
year it has.
</P>
<P>
   I arrived, as in the past, just after the show opened to the
public (it stays open through Nov. 7). The art crowd had left,
which meant I wandered peacefully and nearly alone. As an
experience, it's a useful reminder of the gulf between contemporary
art and most of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The biennale remains a novelty item among the vast inventory of
Venice's tourist attractions, which is a pity when the show is
good, but artists are partly to blame. A few of them arranged
performances during the preview only. The Italian Maurizio Cattelan
(several reviewers picked him out in particular) organized the
burial, every two hours, of a Hindu fakir in sand.
</P>
<P>
   So I searched for the fakir, but he was gone by the time I
arrived, leaving only the pile of sand, incomprehensible to anyone
who wasn't at the opening _ an illustration of what alienates
people from new art.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Harald Szeeman, the veteran Swiss impresario who was
appointed director of this biennale, has, in general, organized the
exhibition cleverly and with a subtle showman's touch, eschewing
any particular theme (themes never worked anyway), and expanding
the display to encompass not just the old national pavilions in the
Giardini and the Corderie, the former rope factory at the ancient
military shipyard, but also several other renovated shipyard
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   These buildings, without question, are the biennale's most
impressive new sight (and site), and several artists (the
Hungarian-born Serge Spitzer, who uses hundreds of glass bottles,
comes to mind) have conceived installations specifically to
highlight the architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of turning the Corderie over to a show of young artists,
which used to happen, Szeeman has also included work from the past
relevant to what's new: a video by Dieter Appelt, the German
artist, from 1981, of a man (supposedly) being sliced in two, is a
shocker that looks new. Bruce Nauman's ``Poke in the
Eye/Nose/Ear,'' which he made in 1994, serves as a precedent for
Rosemarie Trockel's video installation of a giant roving eye in the
German pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   What we get is a spacious, nondidactic, cross-referential and
free-flowing exhibition _ the perfect global survey for the end of
the 20th century _ that paradoxically seems more coherent and
consistent than past biennales. The weight used to be more on the
national pavilions. With each nation picking its own artists for
the pavilions, the result was always a hodgepodge of priorities and
talent.
</P>
<P>
   This year, while the system hasn't changed, it seems to matter
less. It's not really important, for example, that the official
United States presentation is such a disappointment: Ann Hamilton's
installation of red powder falling onto braille texts accompanied
by the piped-in sound of a voice speaking in code, is a work about
incommunication that is itself incommunicative.
</P>
<P>
   But by putting the stress elsewhere, instead of on the national
pavilions, and somehow maintaining a decent level of quality
throughout, Szeeman largely avoids the mix of front-line art and
yard-sale junk that doomed so many biennales.
</P>
<P>
   To be precise, he has taken advantage of the fact that
contemporary artists have finally learned how to adapt to the
peculiar demands of this sort of exhibition. The art may or may not
be marketable outside the festival context, but its true value has
to do not with collectibility but theatricality: a capacity to
command a stage, at least briefly.
</P>
<P>
   From having been a place where different kinds of art from
around the world is gathered, the biennale, along with the other
big international art surveys, has turned into an art form of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker magazine critic Peter Schjeldahl's term Festival
Art fills the bill nicely. It's work that fits with the tune of the
time, according to which anything, in any medium, is now
acceptable, and nothing is particularly essential.

BARCLAYS APPOINTS NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For almost a year, Barclays PLC, one of Britain's
largest banks, has been roiled by the resignations of two of its
chief executives. And investors have anxiously awaited the next
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Barclays announced who would next lead the bank:
Matthew Barrett, the chairman of the Bank of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to hire Barrett, 54, as Barclays' chief executive
came in discussions with him over the last six weeks. His selection
was considered a bit of a surprise because he had recently stepped
down as the Bank of Montreal's chief executive and said at the time
that he planned to retire. Known for a brash and media-savvy style,
Barrett is stepping into a pressure-cooker job that could postpone
retirement for years.
</P>
<P>
   Turmoil in Barclays' executive ranks began when Martin Taylor,
the last full-time chief executive, quit in a dispute over
investment banking strategy late last year. His successor, Michael
O'Neill, a top executive at Bank of America, had not even started
on the job before he resigned in mid-April for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The share price of Barclays has been on a roller-coaster ride,
in part reflecting the uncertainty over who would run the bank.
Barclays stock dropped drastically after Russia's default and
devaluation last summer hammered the company's investment banking
business, and after Taylor resigned.
</P>
<P>
   But the shares have since risen 30 percent as some emerging
markets rebounded. Sir Peter Middleton, the bank's chairman and
acting chief executive, significantly cut costs by eliminating
6,000 jobs in May.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Barclays shares rose nearly 5 percent in reaction to
the announcement of appointment of the new chief.
</P>
<P>
   (START OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, they are getting a seasoned banker with a good
record,'' said Simon Samuels, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney
here.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts think that Barrett may be a deal maker. While at the
Bank of Montreal, he tried to acquire the Royal Bank of Canada, but
the Canadian government blocked the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's clearly got a vision as far as consolidation is
concerned,'' said Alan Reid, a credit-rating analyst at Moody's
Investors Service.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Barrett said he had no secret plan for
Barclays. ``It's too early for me to form an impression,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether he might make an acquisition, Barrett did not rule
out the possibility. ``There's a lot of elbow room over here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Middleton's many moves while acting chief executive may have
already set the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the grand scheme of things,'' Reid said, ``the strategy
probably won't change. The success of this organization is not
restricted to one man.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Barrett is returning to London where he began his banking career
as a trainee teller for the Bank of Montreal in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to ``hit the ground running'' when he begins
work in about two months. He will be one of Europe's highest-paid
executives with a base salary of about $1.35 million, in addition
to a bonus and options that could make his compensation package as
high as $9.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his compensation, he said his personal style would not
change. ``I have an irreverent sense of humor that gets me into the
soup once in awhile,'' he acknowledged.

 &HT;    Gore to visit Ohio, meet with labor women
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS _ Ohio will again be in the spotlight of the 2000
presidential campaign Thursday when Vice President Al Gore visits
Cleveland to strengthen ties with organized labor and collect an
expected $200,000 at a private fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will be greeted by Ohio labor leaders and by officials from
the national AFL-CIO and will hold an open forum on the issues
facing working women.
</P>
<P>
   The forum, titled ``Ask a Working Woman,'' will include a panel
of five women and 200 invited guests at Cleveland State University.
The topics are expected to include wages, child care, health care,
sexual harassment, long work schedules and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll talk about all the things that plague women in the
workplace,'' said Karen Nussbaum, director of the national
AFL-CIO's working women department. ``I think Clinton-Gore have
made a lot of progress for women in the workplace, but a lot more
needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The forum will be a continuation of the AFL-CIO's ``Ask a
Working Woman'' program that kicked off in the spring when First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was campaigning in Buffalo for a U.S.
Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's focus in Cleveland will quickly turn from labor issues to
gathering money for his presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   The forum will be followed by private fund-raiser at the home of
Michael Siegal, president and CEO of the Olympic Steel Co. About
200 people are expected to attend the luncheon at the cost of
$1,000 per person.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit comes exactly a week after Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the leading Republican presidential candidate, made
Cincinnati his first Ohio campaign stop. Bush visited Cincinnati's
predominately black Evanston neighborhood for a public appearance,
then picked up a record $1 million at a ticketed fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Republican Chairman Robert Bennett said Gore's stop in
Cleveland is to maintain support from Ohio's labor leaders, not
from rank and file union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``State and national polls show that about 40 percent of (union
workers) support Republican candidates, but 95 percent of labor's
money is being funneled to Democrats,'' Bennett said. ``And (Gore)
doesn't go anywhere without stopping to raise money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Democratic Chairman David Leland defended Gore's campaign
stop and his relationship with organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that Al Gore and the Democratic party are committed
to helping working families,'' Leland said. ``I don't understand
how the Republicans can criticize the vice president when their
counterparts in Washington are considering giving their wealthiest
contributors a huge tax break.''
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley is challenging Gore for the
Democratic nomination. March 7 is the Ohio primary.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign stop also comes at time when improving pay for
women continues to be an issue around the Ohio Statehouse and
especially for state Rep. Dixie Allen, D-Dayton. Earlier this year,
House Democrats introduced legislation that would correct
discriminatory wage practices based on sex or race. The
legislation, backed by Allen, was introduced by Democratic leaders,
who say women in Ohio are making 72 cents for every dollar earned
by a man.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the legislation would require employers to
document wages paid to employees and explain how they determine
wage rates for all employees.

 &HT;    Browns' offense not pleasing in early-going
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEREA, Ohio _ As the Cleveland Browns installed the shotgun
formation and other nuances Tuesday, their overall offense seemed
to shoot itself in the foot.
</P>
<P>
   And if any doubt remained about the defense being ahead at this
early stage of training camp, it was put to rest after a
mistake-filled morning practice when head coach Chris Palmer made
his offense run a lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't make the head coach pleased,'' Palmer said. ``So
the defense had a chance to stand and contemplate how well they
were doing while the offense ran.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it wasn't a good day to be an offensive player, unless maybe
you were Sedrick Shaw, the former New England halfback who
impressed Palmer with his nose for the end zone in goal-line
situations. Or wide receiver Kevin Johnson, the second-round draft
choice who has done enough things right lately to be running with
the first team, relegating Jermaine Ross to backup status.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the morning session even included an offensive
injury. It ended with third-quarterback candidate John Dutton
sitting on a cart, then hobbling off for treatment on his left
foot, which had been stepped on as he pulled away from center
during a nine-on-seven drill. Later, X-rays revealed a broken bone,
meaning he will be out indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started off slow,'' Palmer said. ``I thought we were a
little anxious. The offensive line came out a little antsy and
jumped offside a couple times. The receivers were not looking at
the ball. They were too busy trying to make big plays and impress
the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sluggishness by the offense did not catch Palmer completely
off guard. The first four practice days had been devoted to
offensive and defensive basics. Tuesday, the playbook opened a bit
wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to do more stuff,'' he said, ``and their heads
are spinning a little bit. It all starts to happen faster and
faster, with everybody competing for jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of finding out who actually knows what they're
doing on either side of the ball, Palmer at one point swept his
assistant coaches to the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get the coaches off the field and let the players
function by themselves,'' he said. ``They've had the security
blanket of the coaches being there and now they're off the field.
It's the next step in building a team and building chemistry and
things like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the offense would have more problems than they did.
The defense blew an alignment call and I wasn't pleased about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Which explains the absolute lack of gloating on the part of the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early,'' defensive tackle John Jurkovic said. ``Anything
you see us doing out there, you've got to take with a grain of
salt. It's always tough for the offense early on.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Derrick Alexander was placed on the
active-physically unable to perform list as he continues to rehab
after undergoing knee surgery. Said Palmer, ``It's just a
precaution meant to give us as many options as we can have.''
Thought to be ahead of schedule, Alexander said he plans to be back
by the third preseason game. Meanwhile, he still counts toward the
roster but will not be able to practice with the team until removed
from the list. He can remain on the list until the Sept. 5 cutdown
date.
</P>
<P>
   According to Palmer, quarterbacks coach John Hufnagel ran the
nightly 11 p.m. bed check Monday and found quarterbacks Tim Couch
and Mike Cook in Cook's room with their playbooks open. This after
a long day at the office for both players, Couch in particular.
``Tim didn't have a great day Monday,'' Palmer said. ``And I let
him know about it.''

FOR THE TURTURRO TROUPE, ACTING IS A FAMILY OUTING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG 1.) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Franz Lidz, a senior writer at Sports Illustrated, is the author of
the memoir ``Unstrung Heroes.'' John Turturro played his father in
the film version of the book.  
 By FRANZ LIDZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's twilight _ the haunting hour that mingles
longing and regret, promise and speculation _ and the world's
youngest method actor is brooding in his Brooklyn bedroom. He's
sprawled under a ``Seven Samurai'' poster, absorbing the warmth and
the silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, I (italics)like(end italics) challenging roles,''
says Amedeo Turturro with the magnificent assurance of an
8-year-old. ``But that role was so challenging, they practically
had to force me to do it.'' The ``they'' he's referring to are his
parents, the actors John Turturro and Katherine Borowitz. The
``it'' is ``Illuminata,'' an engagingly heartfelt new film in which
all three appear.
</P>
<P>
   Though Amedeo had only a single line of dialogue _ ``You were
very excellent in the rehearsal!'' _ he had trouble finding his
motivation. ``I told the director, `Why the heck do I have to say
that?''' recalls the precocious Amedeo, who has his mother's gift
for language and his father's seditious streak. ``The director _
who's my dad _ said, `Because it's in the script.' I got terribly
mad and angry. In fact, I almost quit the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother listened and listened and explained the scene. His
father listened and listened and said: ``You can't quit now. You're
already in the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a quintessential actor-director clash, fraught with
Freudian overtones. Amedeo frowns hard. ``Listen, Bucko,'' he
remembers telling his old man. ``That line has nothing to do with
my character. If you make me say it, I'm going to sue, and you
won't have enough money left to pay your agent.'' Evidently, Dad
saw through the bluff. ``It didn't work,'' Amedeo says with a small
shrug. ``My every word went right through him.''
</P>
<P>
   John Turturro not only helped conceive Amedeo, he also helped
write ``Illuminata,'' a bawdy ``Italo-Swedish date movie,'' as he
describes it (think Fellini- and Bergmanesque) on the muddles of
love and lust, faithfulness and infidelity, selfishness and
self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illuminata,'' which opens on Friday, is about a stock company
of 19th-century actors, and the Turturro family has pretty much
become a stock company, too. Husband and wife have performed
together in three plays and three movies, two of which Amedeo
cameoed in.
</P>
<P>
   When Turturro starred as Gogo last fall in an Off Broadway
production of ``Waiting for Godot,'' Amedeo played The Boy, on
weekends. ``I had to deliver a message,'' Amedeo says. ``Other
characters got angry at me, suspicious. It was a very complicated
role for an 8-year-old, or should I say 8-and-a-quarter-year-old?''
</P>
<P>
   His 42-and-a-half-year-old father has made a career of
complicated roles. In more than 40 films across 19 years, Turturro
has brought soulful vulnerabilty and intense dedication to
desperate loners crabbed by society, Molotov cocktails ready to be
lighted: the throttled playwright in ``Barton Fink''; the scrambled
egghead in ``Quiz Show''; the gleefully demented bowler in ``The
Big Lebowski.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian director Francesco Rosi pitched him the part of
Primo Levi, the chemist who became a brilliant author after
surviving Auschwitz, in ``The Truce'' (1997). ``The film is ironic
and grotesque,'' he said, ``and I feel you have both.''
</P>
<P>
   In conversation, Turturro lists toward the ironic. As he speaks,
his hands are constantly on the move, the tapered fingers combing
the air. An affable man, he comes across as open and unprotected,
with an absurdist sensibility as exuberant as the hero's in his
favorite novel, Knut Hamsun's ``Hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Borowitz is a hardy realist, a Yale-educated linguist as
clearheaded as the heroine of (italics)her(end italics) favorite
novel, Charlotte Bronte's ``Villette.'' She totally lacks the
self-importance many actors project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kathie hasn't fully embraced her ambitious side,'' allows her
husband. Though she has appeared in dozens of films, plays and
television dramas, she is perhaps best known for an ice cream
commercial broadcast in the mid-'80s. ``I was the Frusen Gladje
Girl,'' she admits. ``I polished off a carton without sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   The spot certainly drew attention. One film director called her
agent and demanded, ``Get me the Frusen Gladje Girl!'' Ms. Borowitz
was sent a script by messenger and given a private audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no!'' barked the director. ``Read it like the Frusen
Gladje Girl!''
</P>
<P>
   She tried, but the reception was chillier than a pint of Rocky
Road. ``Not a peep, not a laugh, not a smile,'' she recalls. ``Just
dead silence.'' She didn't get the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sad,'' says Turturro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pathetic!'' corrects Ms. Borowitz. ``I couldn't even be
the Frusen Gladje Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   They take obvious pleasure in each other. Over 18 years
together, they have developed an almost telepathic understanding.
They put that knowledge to work in ``Illuminata.'' Turturro plays
Tuccio, a restless playwright; Ms. Borowitz plays the actress
Rachel, his lover and muse.
</P>
<P>
   For an actor who tends to steal the notices of every film he's
in, Turturro shows considerable restraint as a director, satirizing
the tics and foibles of theater people without turning peevish. His
camera observes Rachel in relentless close-ups, and Ms. Borowitz
does not wilt under the glare. In inflections ranging from
armored-tough to archly tender, she becomes the movie's magnetic
center.
</P>
<P>
   Turturro and his co-writer, Brandon Cole, tinkered with the
script for more than a decade. The film could have been financed
years earlier if Turturro had agreed to let a bankable actress play
Rachel. But he stoutly resisted. (Backing finally came after Susan
Sarandon signed on to the film as an aging diva and Christopher
Walken as a flamboyant critic).
</P>
<P>
   MS. BOROWITZ: Many times I told John: ``I know you're sticking
with this because of me, but you've left not one pebble unturned
and prospects are bleak, so maybe you've should bag it before it
sucks us into a black hole.
</P>
<P>
   TURTURRO: A lot of Kathie was written into Rachel. Kathie is
strong, but also gentle and graceful. Her character holds the film
together.
</P>
<P>
   MS. BOROWITZ (teasingly): Couldn't I have had some more subtle
comedic flourishes?
</P>
<P>
   TURTURRO (earnestly): Believe me, you're the soul of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   The real strength of ``Illuminata'' is that Turturro and Ms.
Borowitz know each other to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   He says: ``Most movies are about falling in love. This one's
about what it is to love someone over time: the differences, the
obstacles you have to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   She says: ``Keeping a relationship alive is a constant, active
process, Especially with individuals whose creativity might draw
them in their own directions.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They became sweethearts at Yale Drama School. He was in his
first year; she, her third. ``They were sensitive, independent
people from diverse backgrounds,'' says Ms. Borowitz's mother,
Lorry. ``Yet their personalities balanced somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in blue-collar Queens, the middle brother of three,
Turturro began working summers with his father, a building
contractor, when he was 10. Ms. Borowitz was the older of two
sisters from moderate affluence: her father, Jim, owned a lamp
factory in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Turturro watched ``The Million Dollar Movie'' (``Boris! Bela!
Edward G.! ... '') with a regularity bordering on addiction. She
played the piano, studied music theory and didn't know Jimmy Cagney
from Jiminy Cricket. Before entering Yale, he got his act together
at the State University of New York at New Paltz, taught history in
Harlem and made his screen debut with one line in ``Raging Bull''
(``Hey, Jake!''). She had majored in music and linguistics at Yale,
earned a master's at Harvard and taught dyslexic teen-agers in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linguisitically, my interest was in how Who You Are affects
What You Say,'' Ms. Borowitz says. ``Now, as an actress, I'm
interested in how What You Say reflects Who You Are _ how the text
informs character, who in turn tells the story.''
</P>
<P>
   It was love at first sight. His sight. ``I saw her in ``Peer
Gynt'' and thought she was the most beautiful girl at Yale,'' he
recalls. (Her face _ long, oval, with an expectant sadness _ so
reminded him of a Modigliani that he gave his son the painter's
first name. ``Since Amedeo Modigliani was Jewish,'' adds Ms.
Borowitz, ``John saw it as a concession to my side of the
family.'')
</P>
<P>
   A month later he spotted her at a mixer. He hooked a finger and
shouted in Queens English: ``You! I want to dance with
(italics)you(end italics) later!''
</P>
<P>
   Huh? thought Ms. Borowitz. Later, they did dance. All night.
Then he asked her out to dinner. ``She didn't want to go,'' he
grumbles. ``She resisted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't resisting,'' she says. ``I just didn't think it would
be as good as the dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, was it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it was pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later they married, and four years after that they
collaborated on Amedeo. ``Kathie went into labor during the filming
of `Barton Fink,''' Turturro says. ``Amedeo was born right before
the severed-head scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first film collaboration was ``Men of Respect'' (1991), a
Mafia ``Macbeth'' featuring Turturro as a manic triggerman and Ms.
Borowitz as his scheming Lady. The patched-together patter
(Elizabethan meets Elizabeth, N.J.) won a cult following, and Ms.
Borowitz won praise for her spidery poise, her creepy impassivity
and her ability to keep a straight face while sleepwalking with a
flashlight and scrubbing her guilty hands in a birdbath.
</P>
<P>
   The couple collaborated again a year later in ``Mac,'' his
directorial debut. Shot on a slim, ``Illuminata''-size budget,
``Mac,'' Turturro's passionate paean to the life, work and values
of his immigrant father, won a standing ovation at Cannes and the
Camera d'Or prize for best first film.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they played a less bloodthirsty pair. A loving,
loyal, resourceful woman, she tempers her husband's native
combustibility just as he breaks down her natural reticence.
</P>
<P>
   The explosiveness Turturro displays in his films is a quality he
can adopt or drop at will. There's no trace of it in the serenity
of the spacious brownstone where he, his wife and Amedeo dodge the
Hollywood scene. Walls are hung with vintage posters of Turturro's
acting pantheon: Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Toshiro Mifune, John
Cassavettes.
</P>
<P>
   Looming over the mantle in the back parlor is a jaunty sketch of
Pierre Brasseur in ``Les Enfants du Paradis,'' Marcel Carne's 1945
film meditation on theater and life, perhaps the ideal for
``Illuminata.''
</P>
<P>
   Out back, amid the hydrangeas and climbing roses craning for
sunlight, the couple argue amiably about their favorite singers
(She: Barbra Streisand; he: Frank Sinatra) and agree amiably about
their favorite comic actor (Peter Sellers), tragic actress (Anna
Magnani), musicians (Mozart, Louis Armstrong) and memoirs
(``Survival at Auschwitz'') and food (bread).
</P>
<P>
   ``Bread!'' Amedeo pipes in. ``What about pizza?''
</P>
<P>
   The couple are grounded in Brooklyn. Turturro goes out of his
way to work as close to home as possible, prefering East Coast jobs
to West. Usually, it's Ms. Borowitz who minds the store, though a
few years back she spent 14 weeks in San Francisco performing in
Tom Stoppard's ``Arcadia'' with the American Conservatory Theater.
Amedeo stayed with his father on a movie (``Box of Moonlight'') in
the backwoods of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going away to work for such a long time was a tricky
proposition,'' Ms. Borowitz says. ``Still, I thought it was
important, so I went.'' She wrote a precis so that Amedeo would
understand the play better when he came to visit. ``But I had no
idea he'd be on the edge of his seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Amedeo may also be the world's youngest textual critic. Turturro
often sounds out scripts to him. Last year he got a handsome offer
to play a comic action-hero. He read the screenplay to Amedeo, who
said, ``Dad, this is garbage!'' Turturro also had a downright
homely offer to be in ``Godot.'' He read the play to Amedeo, who
cackled at the black boot, the chicken bone, the metaphysical
musings. ``Now (italics)that's(end italics) funny!'' said Amedeo.
</P>
<P>
   He tried out for The Boy, and got hired. ``It wasn't anything
any of us had pursued,'' says Ms. Borowitz. ``It was more of a
family experience, a chance for him to get up close to his dad at
work.''
</P>
<P>
   When Amedeo got antsy in rehearsals, his mother suggested
weighting him down with lead shoes. Instead, he was outfitted in an
overcoat so heavy he could barely move. This didn't keep him from
sometimes wobbling around onstage like a bowling pin. ``I had this
big coat on,'' he says. ``I thought it would be good to act cold.''
</P>
<P>
   To Amedeo, the hopeless tramps who slouch through ``Godot'' are
not different from the hopeful troupe that scurries through
``Illuminata.'' ``They all have the very same mind,'' he says.
``They pass through huge obstacle courses, and realize they need
other people to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   His family is like that, too. ``To stay happy together without
losing our imaginations, my parents and I rely on each other,''
says Amedeo. ``Or should I say they rely on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Why you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they (italics)know(end italics) they can't get away
with anything. I'm the child.''

<P>
   For the first time, the Basque leftist coalition regarded as the
political wing of the Basque rebel group ETA signed a statement
with other parties to condemn ``all'' violence that hinders
political freedom. The coalition said it had done nothing new but
leaders of parties across the spectrum hailed the joint statement
as a positive step for peace, 10 months after the Basque rebels
declared a cease-fire.

   Some 25,000 truck drivers began a 72-hour work stoppage,

IN UNIVERSITY OF WASH. SEX STUDY, MEN SAY THEY ALSO FEEL
PRESSURED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH SCHUBERT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's a raucous college party, and hormones are running
high. When the unwanted sexual advances start flying, it's not just
men hitting on women.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, men are victims nearly as often as women are, says a
University of Washington survey of 296 fraternity and sorority
pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Male students reported unwanted sexual contact and coercion in
numbers comparable to the women in the study, which is published in
the current issue of the journal Sex Roles, a peer review
publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, it was surprising to me,'' said Mary Larimer,
research assistant professor of psychology and the principle
investigator. ``I didn't set out expecting to find this.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey is part of a larger study at the UW's Addictive
Behaviors Research Center. It is based on a questionnaire that
asked students if they had experienced five types of unwanted
sexual contact, from feeling pressured into sex to physical force.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was designed to be representative of Greek Row, but
not necessarily representative of the broader campus population,
the study notes. Overall, 21 percent of the men and 28 percent of
the women said they'd been on the receiving end of at least one of
the five types of unwanted contact.
</P>
<P>
   Men were more likely to use force _ or drugs or alcohol _ to
coerce sex. They were also more likely to feel pressured into
having sexual intercourse even though they didn't want it, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   Women were more likely to insist on sex based on their own
arousal, or to argue for sexual intercourse. They also were were
more likely to get hit on after they had been drinking and were
five times more likely to be victims of physical force.
</P>
<P>
   While less than 1 percent of the men reported physical force, 5
percent of the women said they had been pressured physically,
whether or not sex occurred. The survey characterized such force as
someone ``twisting your arm or holding you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Larimer theorized that because the responses were confidential,
men may have been more willing to admit feeling used sexually than
they would in casual conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Street, a 25-year-old college graduate from Maine who works
at the UW, said he understood why men would feel ashamed if they
had engaged in unwanted sex. ``It's the male ego,'' said Street,
who was lying under the cherry trees in the UW's quad on Monday.
``That a woman had some kind of power (to force unwanted sex) is
hard to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the UW campus on Monday, the study results sometimes had
trouble meeting the credulity test.
</P>
<P>
   UW junior Fred Angermeier said he was skeptical of the finding
that so many men reported being pressured into unwanted sex.
``Maybe girls do do that, but I don't hear about it,'' he said. ``I
don't think most guys would need to be that pressured.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Papenfuss, a sophomore, said that he had never felt
pressured by a woman. ``But I'm a guy, and guys always want to have
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students were less surprised by the study and said that
they had witnessed women behaving aggressively with men, especially
when alcohol was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett Glenn, a university freshman, said he has seen women be
more of the aggressor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt uncomfortable for me _ I guess from what I've seen on
the TV or in the movies where the man is always dominant,'' Glenn
said. ``I felt weird. It felt wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Larimer said she has received comments like ``How can men be
taken advantage of sexually?'' Larimer said she, too, was surprised
to find that the initial study questions reflected a bias she had
been unaware of.
</P>
<P>
   Study participants were the ones who pointed out that coercion
cuts both ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both men and women are experiencing unwanted sexual advances,
and our preliminary indications are that men are suffering from
those experiences just as much as women,'' Larimer wrote in a news
release. ``I was surprised at how guilty and ashamed some of the
men were and that we, as researchers, were buying into a cultural
myth and didn't think such experiences were the same for men as for
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Larimer has since changed her own approach as a clinical
psychologist, addressing unsafe and unwanted sex with men clients
as well as with women. ``They're ashamed, they feel guilty, they
feel sad,'' she said. ``But, they have been willing to talk to me
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But coming into an office and volunteering the information is a
different matter, said Barbara Hammond, director of counseling
services at Washington State University. ``We do see some
heterosexual men who do feel that they have been aggressed upon,''
she said. ``It's not common that we have a man come in with that
complaint, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Although initially surprised by the study's findings, Hammond
said, harassment of male students by female students is something
that universities may need to address.
</P>
<P>
   The UW study is part of a larger research project being
undertaken by the UW's Addictive Behaviors Research Center. Funded
by the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, the
larger study is looking at alcohol abuse prevention among
fraternity and sorority members.
</P>
<P>
   Larimer says other studies conducted in the past two decades
also found men complaining of unwanted sexual advances in numbers
comparable to women. But she sees avenues for further research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's lacking is a more in-depth understanding of
what both men and women mean when they respond to these questions
and what the short- and long-term impact on them emotionally is,''
Larimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Post-Intelligencer reporters Lisa Stiffler and Judd
Slivka contributed to this report.
</P>
<P>
   THE SEX REPORT:
</P>
<P>
   _ Unwanted sexual contact: Men, 21 percent; Women, 28 percent
</P>
<P>
   _ Unwanted sex because partner was aroused: Men, 14 percent;
Women, 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pressured into unwanted sex by continual arguments: Men, 8
percent; Women, 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Partner attempted interscourse using physical force: Men, less
than 1 percent; Women 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Partner attempted intercourse after giving drugs/alcohol: Men,
9 percent; Women, 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unwanted sex after they were given drugs/alcohol: Men, 4
percent; Women, 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alcohol led to sexual situation later regretted: Men, 47

 &HT;    Mature Vols are prepared for bell
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM _ Tee Martin was calm and comfortable as he walked
through the hotel lobby. Every third step, the Tennessee
quarterback paused to sign an autograph or handle a reporter's
inquiry. He was all smiles until someone asked the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that Tennessee has finally won a national championship,''
an inquiring mind wanted to know, ``do you think this team will get
complacent?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was a firm no and a promise: ``It's my job, and the
rest of the captains' jobs, to make sure that we don't. And believe
me, we will.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason why only one team (Nebraska, 1994-95) has won
back-to-back national championships in the past 20 years. It is
difficult to hit upon the combination of talent, circumstance and
luck to win one national title as Tennessee did last season in a
memorable 13-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the annual SEC Football Kickoff began Thursday,
Tennessee's players and coaches are convinced that this team can.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is so much more mature,'' defensive tackle Darwin
Walker said. ``We learned what it takes to win a championship. And
nobody is going to give less than that effort again.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words were music to the ears of coach Phillip Fulmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't peer into these guy's heads and tell you exactly what
they are thinking,'' he said. ``I can tell you how they've been out
there in the summer sweating and getting ready. They will be ready
when the bell rings.''
</P>
<P>
   Physically, the Volunteers could be even better than they were a
season ago. The offensive line is stronger, the running game will
be better as Jamal Lewis returns from a knee injury, and Martin
seems ready. A talented defense is still looking to replace
linebacker Al Wilson's inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   But will the ball bounce Tennessee's way, as it did last season?
The Vols needed late field goals to beat Syracuse and Florida.
Until Clint Stoerner's famous fumble in the final two minutes,
Arkansas was better. Mississippi State led in the fourth quarter of
the SEC title game. Still, the Vols came home from the Fiesta Bowl
with an unbeaten record and their first national championship since
1951.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to think that last year was just luck,'' Walker
said. ``We know how good this team can be. It's just up to us to
make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the way are some difficult Saturdays:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Sept. 18 trip to Florida, where the Vols have not won since
1971;
</P>
<P>
   _ A Nov. 13 trip to Arkansas to meet Hogs bent on revenge;
</P>
<P>
   _ A road game against Alabama in Tuscaloosa, a site where the
Vols traditionally lay down;
</P>
<P>
   _ Home games against Georgia and Notre Dame. ``All I know is how
I felt after winning the Fiesta Bowl,'' Martin said. ``I want to
feel that way again. We all want to feel that way again.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ He said he had dreamed of killing women for 30
years before he found his moment this February, when a middle-aged
woman and two teen-agers on a sightseeing trip to Yosemite National
Park happened to take a room at the motel where he worked as a
janitor.
</P>
<P>
   He killed all three women, Carey Stayner told a television
reporter on Monday night. Then he laid low, escaping suspicion of
the FBI when he was interviewed later in February by its agents,
who then focused on a group of ex-convicts as suspects.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, he said, he could no longer resist the temptation
to kill again, and he decapitated a 26-year-old Yosemite
naturalist, Joie Ruth Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   In a 25-minute jailhouse interview in Sacramento only hours
after he was charged in federal court there with the murder of Ms.
Armstrong, Stayner told the reporter, Ted Rowlands of KBWB-TV in
San Francisco, that he had fantasized since childhood about
murdering women and had killed these four ``because they were at
the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview was conducted off-camera and reported Monday on
the late news. In it, Rowlands reported that Stayner said he
planned to plead guilty to the Armstrong killing when he is
arraigned in Fresno on Aug. 6 and that he also wanted to plead
guilty to the other killings, with which he has not yet been
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands said Stayner, a 37-year-old janitor at the Cedar Lodge
in El Portal, on Yosemite's western edge, had given a detailed
account of how he had killed Carole Sund, 42, her daughter Juli
Sund, 15, and their friend Silvina Pelosso, 16. Their disappearance
from the Cedar Lodge on Feb. 15 generated a vast investigation and
national headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner, whose only prior arrest was for marijuana possession,
told Rowlands that he had tricked the three women into letting him
into their room and had then held them at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had strangled Carole Sund and Ms. Pelosso there, put
their bodies into the trunk of their rental car and then made Juli
Sund drive with him as he searched for a place to kill her and dump
the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, he said, he killed Juli Sund, by slashing her
throat so fiercely that he nearly severed her head, and dumped her
body near a creek. He then left the rental car, with two bodies
still in the trunk, at the remote community of Long Barn, a
two-and-a-half-hour drive east of El Portal, and took a taxi and a
bus back home.
</P>
<P>
   He did not sexually abuse any of his victims, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, he said, he returned _ not only to burn the car
but also to retrieve Mrs. Sund's wallet, which he used to throw the
FBI off his track by dumping it off a highway in Modesto, about
midway between El Portal and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic worked. When Mrs. Sund's wallet was found in Modesto,
both the FBI and local law-enforcement officials set up command
centers at a local hotel and began focusing on suspects in the
Modesto area. Several men with long criminal records have been held
in connection with the case for months, and a federal grand jury
has been hearing testimony since April from associates of those in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, when it announced that Stayner had been arrested
in the decapitation of Ms. Armstrong and was now ``the prime
suspect'' in the February slayings, the FBI had maintained that all
the people involved in those earlier killings were in custody,
albeit on unrelated charges.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the television interview, two previously reported
FBI affidavits say that Stayner has confessed in detail to all four
killings, describing facts about the crimes that only someone
involved could have known.
</P>
<P>
   In the television interview, Stayner also told of involvement of
a different kind. The FBI had said that a tip led them to Juli
Sund's body. In his interview, Stayner said that he wrote a letter
to the FBI telling them where to look, and that he had someone else
lick the envelope so that his DNA could not be traced.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, an FBI spokesman, Nick Rossi, declined to comment on
the affidavits and refused to confirm or deny any statements
Stayner ``may have made.''
</P>
<P>
   Stayner's arrest, and confession, has brought new scrutiny to
the investigation of the case. James M. Maddock, who is in charge
of the FBI's Sacramento office, said that the agency will be
examining what, if anything, might have been done differently.
</P>
<P>
   In his confessions, both as described in the affidavits and by
the television station, Stayner said he took pains to throw
officials off by wetting towels in the women's room in the Cedar
Lodge to make it seem as if they had been there the day after he
had killed them.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner's family, was the victim of a terrible crime when he was
11. Stayner's younger brother, Steven, was kidnapped in their
hometown of Merced, and was held for seven years by a sexual
molester. When his abductor showed up one day with a new victim,
Steven and the younger boy escaped. Eight years later, in 1989, at
age 24, Steven was killed in a motorcycle crash.
</P>
<P>
   Reports by local news organizations have been filled with
speculation that Steven's ordeal may somehow have led his brother
to perpetrate violence against women. But in the interview, Stayner
said that he had fantasized about killing women since he was 7,
years before his brother was kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Stayner's father, Delbert Stayner, said that he
still could not believe that his son had committed the murders.
``Maybe someone threatened him into confessing,'' he said in a
brief telephone interview, his voice breaking.

GOVERNMENT PROPOSES TO MONITOR BANKING AND OTHER COMPUTER
NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
(js) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has developed a plan for an extensive
computer monitoring system, overseen by the FBI, to protect the
nation's crucial data networks from intruders.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, an outgrowth of the administration's anti-terrorism
program, has already raised concerns from civil liberties groups.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the plan, prepared by officials at the National
Security Council last month and provided to The New York Times by a
civil liberties group, calls for a sophisticated software system to
monitor activities on non-military government networks and a
separate system to track networks used in the banking,
telecommunications and transportation industries.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, whose details are still being debated within the
administration, is intended to alert law enforcement officials to
attacks that might cripple governmental operations or the nation's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the increasing power of the nation's computers
and their emerging role as a backbone of the nation's commerce,
politics and culture, critics of the proposed system say it could
become a building block for a surveillance infrastructure with
great potential for misuse.
</P>
<P>
   They also argue that such a network of monitoring programs could
itself be open to security breaches, giving intruders or
unauthorized users a vast window into government and corporate
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department began deploying such a system three years
ago. But Government officials said that the changing nature of
military threats in the information age had altered the nature of
national security concerns and created a new sense of urgency to
protect the nation's information infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern about organized cyber attack has escalated
dramatically,'' Jeffrey Hunker, the National Security Council's
director of information protection, who is overseeing the plan,
said Tuesday. ``We do know of a number of hostile foreign
governments that are developing sophisticated and well organized
offensive cyber attack capabilities and we have good reason to
believe that terrorists may be developing similar capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plan, networks of thousands of software
monitoring programs would constantly track computer activities,
looking for indications of computer network intrusions and other
illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the creation of a Federal Intrusion Detection
Network, or Fidnet, and specifies that the data it collects will be
gathered in a centralized data center at the National
Infrastructure Protection Center, an interagency task force housed
at the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system, to be put fully in place by 2003, is meant to
permit government security experts to track ``patterns of
patterns'' of information and respond in a coordinated manner
against intruders and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   For example, officials said that such a system might have
protected against intrusions recently reported in computers at the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces information like the
consumer price index that can affect the performance of the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   The draft report, which has been circulated widely within the
executive branch, has generated concern among some officials over
its privacy implications. Several officials involved in the debate
over the plan said that the situation was ``fluid'' and that many
aspects were still not final.
</P>
<P>
   The report is vague on several crucial points, including the
kinds of data to be collected and the specific federal and
corporate computer networks to be monitored. The report also lacks
details about the ways information collected in non-governmental
agencies would be maintained and under what conditions it would be
made available to law enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that the National Security Council was
conducting a legal and technical review of the plan and that a
final report is scheduled to be released in September, subject to
President Clinton's approval.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The plan was created in response to a presidential directive in
May 1998 requiring the executive branch to review the
vulnerabilities of the federal government's computer systems in
order to become a ``model of information and security.''
</P>
<P>
   In a cover letter to the draft plan Clinton writes, ``A
concerted attack on the computers of any one of our key economic
sectors or governmental agencies could have catastrophic effects.''
</P>
<P>
   But the plan strikes at the heart of a growing controversy over
how to protect the nation's computer systems while also protecting
civil liberties _ particularly since it would put a new and
powerful tool into the hands of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, data flowing over the Internet is becoming a vital
tool for law enforcement, and civil liberties experts said law
enforcement agencies would be under great temptation to expand the
use of the information in pursuit of suspected criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report clearly recognizes the civil liberties
implications,'' said James X. Dempsey, staff counsel for the Center
for Democracy and Technology, a Washington civil liberties group,
``But it brushes them away.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft plan states: ``As access to relevant networks is
premised on `consent' of the user to allow session monitoring, the
collection of certain data identified as anomalous activity or a
suspicious event would not be considered a privacy issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey conceded the legal validity of the point, but said there
was tremendous potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern is that Fidnet is an ill-defined monitoring
system of potentially broad sweep,'' he said. ``It seems to place
monitoring and surveillance at the center of the government's
response to a problem that is not well suited to such measures.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is making a concerted effort to insure
that civil liberties and privacy rights are not violated by the
plan, Hunker said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that data gathered from non-government computer networks
will be collected separately from the FBI-controlled monitoring
system at a separate location within a General Services
Administration building. He said that was done to keep
non-government data at arm's length from law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also has drawn concern from civil libertarians because
it blends civilian and military functions in protecting the
nation's computer networks. The report notes that there is already
a Department of Defense ``contingent'' working at the FBI's
infrastructure protection center to integrate intelligence,
counterintelligence and law enforcement efforts in protecting
Pentagon computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight over this could make the fight over encryption look
like nothing,'' said Mary Culnan, an professor at Georgetown
University who served on a presidential commission whose work led
to the May 1998 directive on infrastructure protection. ``The
conceptual problem is that there are people running this program
who don't understand how citizens feel about privacy in
cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has been discussing the proposal widely with a
number of industry security committees and associations in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry executives said there is still reluctance on
the part of industry to directly share information on computer
intrusions with law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to control the decision-making process,'' said Mark
Rasch, vice president and general counsel of Global Integrity, a
company in Reston, Va., that coordinates computer security for the
financial services industries.
</P>
<P>
   One potential problem in carrying out the government's plan is
that intrusion-detection software technology is still immature,
industry executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercial intrusion detection systems are not ready for
prime time,'' said Peter Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI
International in Menlo Park, Calif., and a pioneer in the field of
intrusion detection systems.
</P>
<P>
   Current systems tend to generate false alarms and thus require
many skilled operators.
</P>
<P>
   But a significant portion of the $1.4 billion the Clinton
administration has requested for computer security for fiscal year
2000 is intended to be spent on research, and government officials
said they were hopeful that the planned effort would be able to
rely on automated detection technologies and on artificial
intelligence capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   For several years computer security specialists have used
software variously known as packet filters or ``sniffers'' as
monitoring devices to track computer intruders. Like telephone
wiretaps, such tools can be used to reconstruct the activities of a
computer user as if a videotape were made of his computer display.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the software tools are routinely
misused by illicit computer network users to steal information such
as passwords or other data.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, the Pentagon has begun to string
together entire network surveillance systems by outfitting them
with filters that report data to a central site, much as a burglar
alarm might be reported at the local police station.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, commercial vendors are beginning to sell monitoring
tools that combine packet filtering with more sophisticated and
automated intrusion detection software that tries to detect abuse
by looking for behavior patterns or certain sequences of commands.

ABC HOPES `MILLIONAIRE' WILL WIN OVER VIEWERS HERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you want to be a millionaire? Call 900-933-9391 and you may
not have to rue the day you didn't buy Microsoft. The call costs a
buck fifty, but if you're the type with a lot of extraneous trivia
dripping into the brain pan and you can retrieve it quickly, you
just might parlay the investment into some large green next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' is already a huge hit in Great
Britain. Regis Philbin thinks the quiz show will be a winner here,
too, and he has signed to host 13 installments airing nightly
(except Aug. 23) from Aug. 16-29 at 8:30 on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   If viewers like it, ``Millionaire'' could return in a variety of
forms: weekly or twice-weekly show, or perhaps in another special
block of consecutive airings. Either way, the prime-time game show
as alternative to the traditional sitcom is obviously gaining favor
at ABC. A U.S. version of England's ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?''
started as a summer experiment and won a spot on the fall schedule.
And Daily Variety reports that Norm Mcdonald, star of ABC's ``The
Norm Show,'' may host a political quiz show titled ``Have I Got
News for You,'' also patterned after a British series.
</P>
<P>
   ABC Entertainment President Jamie Tarses said it only makes
sense to see what else might appeal to viewers beyond the usual
fare. ``It doesn't hurt that they cost less to produce (than
sitcoms) in this current landscape,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ David E. Kelley created ``Chicago Hope'' but reduced his
involvement after the first season. He returned to write last
season's finale, a now-famous episode that created a shortage of
pinks slips at CBS. In that one show, Kelley eliminated six
characters in what he describes as a necessary effort to give
``Chicago Hope'' new life. Gone are Christine Lahti, Vondie
Curtis-Hall, Peter Berg, Jayne Brook, Stacy Edwards and Eric
Stoltz. To do the dirty work, Kelley brought back Mandy Patinkin as
Dr. Jeffrey Geiger, the ego that ate Chicago. As chairman of the
hospital's board, Geiger cashiered a handful of doctors, lambasting
each as only Geiger can.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley insists Geiger's tirade was not a criticism of the
quality of ``Chicago Hope,'' but he admits the show veered from the
path he'd originally intended, focusing more on personal
relationships and less on doctoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first road we went down was to explore the profession and
the pioneering aspects of medicine,'' Kelley said, ``and there's a
lot of those stories that remain to be told.'' Besides adding
Patinkin for occasional appearances next season, Kelley has brought
aboard Barbara Hershey, Lauren Holly and Carla Gugino, with more
newcomers on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kelley will continue to spend most of his time writing
``The Practice'' for ABC and ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Ally'' for Fox,
he has written the sixth-season premiere of ``Chicago Hope'' and
may do one or two more episodes. Otherwise, he will be an active
consultant, he says, similar to his role on the new ABC series,
``Snoops.''
</P>
<P>
   _ With elaborate production numbers, zany contests and an entire
episode filmed in China, ``The Drew Carey Show'' pushes the
envelope, and often overstuffs it. Next up is an effort likely to
be a collector's item among videophiles, no matter the outcome.
Sometime in November, an episode of the ABC series will air live
and partly unscripted, allowing cast members to improvise. There
will be three versions, so viewers in the Eastern/Central, Mountain
and Pacific time zones will each see a live show _ and one that
potentially is quite different from the others.
</P>
<P>
   Via ABC press release, executive producer Bruce Helford said,
``Anything can happen. I just hope they don't tap the keg until
after the third show.''

FAMILY COURT FIGHT SHOWS HOW PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS POSE AS
REPORTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: SUBS 10th graf of 3rd take, The credit ..., to CORRECT,
Charles Koch is `second-oldest' sted eldest.)  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. _ One of America's wealthiest and most private
families found itself in an unwanted spotlight last summer as its
fractious members waged a bitter courtroom fight over the family
business, Koch Industries, the vast oil and gas company with
headquarters on the prairie at the edge of town here.
</P>
<P>
   But in the corridors and shadows outside the courtroom, another,
more secret battle was taking place, one that reveals a new and
powerful tactic in corporate intrigue. As the jury listened to
evidence, private investigators were infiltrating the press corps
covering the trial in an effort to influence the public's view of
the family struggle and to tip sentiment in favor of its black
sheep, William Koch.
</P>
<P>
   Former news reporters working as investigators on behalf of Koch
(pronounced coke) posed as journalists to try to obtain
confidential information about Koch Industries and to distribute
negative information to legitimate reporters about the company and
Koch's brothers, Charles and David, according to interviews and
documents from the investigative firm that hired them. At least one
newspaper ran a front-page article based in part on the
information.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the Koch case provides an unusually detailed
look at an increasingly common tactic in business disputes: the use
of private detectives. But it also reveals a growing practice
within the detective industry of employing former reporters not
only for their investigative skills but for their willingness to
trade on their past occupation to gain access to sources who would
be unlikely to speak to a private investigator.
</P>
<P>
   And it raises new questions about the seemingly legal, but
ethically questionable, ploys private detectives use to get
information, at a time when there is increasing scrutiny of what is
fast becoming a major American business.
</P>
<P>
   One of Koch's private detectives sought sensitive documents from
a reporter at The Wichita Eagle by claiming he was working on an
article about the Kochs, according to the reporter. Another
detective said he was writing a book and used articles he had
written for several publications to try to obtain interviews with
Koch Industries executives. The documents show he was actually
working on behalf of Koch, who was trying to learn everything he
could about the company run by his brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In a different type of attempt to influence the press, an
investigator said he was offered a $25,000 bonus if he could
persuade a reporter at any national newspaper to publish a negative
article about Koch Industries. The investigator provided
information to a reporter, but he said the bonus had not been paid.
A spokesman for Koch said he had refused the detective's overtures
to place a story for pay.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics surrounding the trial last summer were only the
latest skirmish in a festering dispute between opposing factions of
the Koch family in which private investigators have often been the
mercenaries. Court documents show that detectives working for
William Koch bought trash from the homes of company lawyers and
investigated the family business, while people working for William
said they were followed and harassed by investigators on the Koch
Industries payroll.
</P>
<P>
   These days a majority of the work done by private investigators
involves business disputes. The demands of these corporate clients
have helped to transform the world of private detectives from a
slightly seedy business dominated by ex-cops into a sophisticated,
multibillion-dollar industry with access to the best surveillance
equipment and computer databases. But this growth has collided with
privacy concerns, particularly over deceptions used to obtain
confidential information about individuals and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Colorado grand jury indicted two investigators who
used various subterfuges to gather information on celebrities and
other people. And Congress is considering legislation to make it a
federal crime to obtain financial information from banks by
pretending to be someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Determining how often investigators pose as journalists is
difficult, but what occurred in Wichita clearly was not an isolated
incident. Internet sites, like Espionage Unlimited in Burlington,
Vt., even sell laminated photo cards for $39.95 that identify the
bearer as an employee of a fictitious organization called American
Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, investigators around the country said pretending
to be a journalist was an accepted practice in the industry, one
rarely discovered by subjects of investigations. Those who use it
often justify the pretext as the only means of getting accurate
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all much prefer being who we are, but sometimes you use a
deception because nothing else will produce the truth,'' said Jack
Palladino, a San Francisco private detective who worked for Bill
Clinton in his 1992 campaign. ``You know if you stated honestly to
this person that you were a private investigator, they would lie to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Palladino said he and his wife and partner, Sandra Sutherland,
claim to be journalists on occasion. In a widely publicized example
in the late 1980s, Ms. Sutherland pretended to be a journalist to
get information about a smear campaign against the banker Edmond
Safra orchestrated by American Express.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in May, an investigator for Kroll Associates, the
world's largest investigative firm, was looking into a huge real
estate project in Hong Kong by pretending to be a reporter for a
Seattle publication until he was unmasked after an amateurish
blunder.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator sent an e-mail to David Webb, the editor of
Cyberport, an Internet publication that had criticized the
development. The investigator said he wanted to discuss Webb's view
on the project as part of his research for an article.
Unfortunately for the investigator, he used an e-mail with Kroll's
electronic address, tipping Webb to the subterfuge and leading to
his exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cherkasky, the president of Kroll, confirmed the account
of the incident, which first appeared on Webb's Web site. Cherkasky
declined to identify the investigator, but he said he was fired for
violating Kroll's policy against misrepresentation. Cherkasky said
Kroll had also stopped using an outside investigator whose standard
procedure was to claim to be a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, an investigator for the Investigative Group
International, another big investigative firm, tried to get
information about a candidate for governor of Tennessee by claiming
he was writing a book. When suspicious campaign officials tried to
take his photograph, the investigator thrust his briefcase in front
of his face and fled, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Anthony, the case supervisor at the time, acknowledged
that the investigator, Mike Burns, was working for him. ``They
caught him and he took off running,'' said Anthony, who now works
at another detective agency.
</P>
<P>
   Pretending to be a journalist is not illegal, although several
years ago a Delaware court sanctioned lawyers for allowing Kroll
investigators to pose as reporters and impartial consultants in
questioning former employees of a chemical company.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of former reporters posing as working journalists to
gather information raises broader ethical questions about the use
of ruses and pretexts by private detectives. It also creates
concerns that detectives posing as journalists erode public trust
in the press and jeopardize its independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason people feel confident talking to journalists
is that they believe they are talking to an independent source
representing their interests and the interests of the truth, not to
someone who is part of the police apparatus, whether public or
private,'' said Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation for
Journalism at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many former investigative reporters who work as
private detectives are Larry Gurwin, a former Time magazine
correspondent who is with Control Risks Group; Diana Moneta, a
former reporter and editor at newspapers on Long Island, N.Y., who
is with Investigative Consultants International; John Hanrahan, a
former Washington Post reporter who works for the James B. Mintz
Group; and Kathy Lavinder, a former ABC radio journalist who is at
Investigative Group International.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Pankau, a private investigator who teaches techniques to
journalists and detectives alike, said similar research skills are
required for both jobs. And most former journalists, he said, do
not use their old jobs as cover for investigative work.
</P>
<P>
   In the Koch case, the use of investigators posing as journalists
was described in records from the investigative firm that hired
them. The records, from Decision Strategies International, a large
investigative firm known by the initials DSFX, were sent
unsolicited to The New York Times by an employee. The employee has
since left to work for a competing company and insisted that his
identity be withheld.
</P>
<P>
   DSFX disputed the accuracy of its memorandums in a statement:
``We never engaged in the kind of actions described in this
self-serving and inaccurate document. It is a clear violation of
the company's standards and procedures for any of our employees or
contractors to pose as working journalists in the course of an
investigation. Anyone doing so is in clear violation of our
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hershman, the DSFX chairman, said he could not confirm
that the firm had worked for William Koch because contracts with
clients require confidentiality. Brad Goldstein, a spokesman for
Koch, said the multimillionaire had hired DSFX in the past, but the
spokesman would not specify why and said Koch never authorized
posing as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Hershman said DSFX prohibits its investigators from saying they
work for a specific publication, but he said they could identify
themselves as journalists if they held such jobs in the past and
continue to do some journalism work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are indeed a freelance journalist who also does
private investigation, essentially they are not lying,'' Hershman
said. ``I don't want them to misrepresent, but there is a fine
line. It's a difficult world out there.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no accepted definition of a freelance journalist, just
as there is no way to disprove a former journalist's assertion that
he is thinking about writing an article or book about a particular
subject. Many publications and broadcast outlets rely on part-time
workers who hold other jobs, including as private investigators.
Further muddying the issue, some media organizations, particularly
television, hire private detectives to help with research.

 &HT;    Vexing close to season for Lopez
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The realization that his season is over too soon is
beginning to sink in for Javy Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, who has not previously had a season cut short, is
scheduled to have surgery to repair the torn anterior cruciate
ligament in his right knee on Monday at Piedmont Hospital. Dr.
Marvin Royster, who operated on Chipper Jones' knee in 1994, will
perform the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is disappointing,'' Lopez said. ``I'm down and I have this
anger that I can't help the team win games, even though I have
confidence in Eddie Perez. He's been great. And Greg Myers has been
around for a while. But still it's going to be very difficult for
me to watch games and know I want to be there to help the team
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez plans to stay in Atlanta for his surgery and recovery,
which should take about six months to the start of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the latest in a tumultuous season. Lopez's mother
died suddenly on May 7. He also has a second child on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this is the one year that everything happened,''
Lopez said. ``Hopefully, next year is totally the opposite, the
year 2000 will be the best of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a lot of stuff worse than (his knee) this year,''
Perez said. ``He wants to keep playing, to forget other stuff that
happened. But there's nothing he can do about it. He'll have his
surgery and work it up for next year. His mom passed away. He wants
to take care of his brothers and his dad. He's going to have a baby
later this year. I mean, he's worried about his knee and he wants
to play. It helps take away some of the things he worries about too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Odalis Perez waits
</P>
<P>
   Odalis Perez awaits word from Dr. James Andrews to see whether
his left elbow requires ``Tommy John'' ligament repair surgery. The
decision will come by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see my career over at 21 years old,'' Perez
said. ``If the doctor's decision is to have surgery, I'm ready for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he remembers feeling something on a pitch in the
third inning of the Yankees game on July 17. Perez gave up two of
the season-high eight runs in that inning. He made one more start
in Florida last Thursday, which lasted only four outs, before the
Braves put him on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's chance
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chen will be making his second start as the Braves' fifth
starter tonight and not just the fill-in for an injured John
Smoltz. With the news that Perez is out for the year, Chen's job
just got that much more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll still have the same approach,'' Chen said. ``Go out, give
the team innings and do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   One difference in Chen's previous start _ when he pitched 7 2/3
innings and allowed only an unearned run for his first major-league
win _ was his breaking pitch. The Braves had him scrap the slow
curveball for a slider.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz good for now
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz knows well enough by now not to promise much beyond his
next start, considering the state of his tender elbow. So for now
all he can say is he'll be ready for his next start on Friday
against the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about the next four or five starts, I can only
worry about the next one,'' said Smoltz, who had his first start
since coming off the disabled list on Saturday in Philadelphia.
``It's not going to just go away. Two different stints (on the
disabled list) haven't made it go away, all kinds of treatment
haven't made it go away.. . . There are going to be some good
starts and some bad ones. I'll just try not to make the bad ones so
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz said another elbow surgery like he's had twice before
will not help his situation.
</P>
<P>
   Myers to work
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case, manager Bobby Cox put a new player to work
quickly. Myers, the catcher the Braves acquired in a deal from the
Padres on Monday, caught Tuesday night's game against the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Myers played sparingly for the Braves in September of 1997 and
caught only Paul Byrd and Kerry Ligtenberg. So he'll spend the next
several days doing a lot of talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try to get a good game plan (from the pitchers), see what
they like to do,'' Myers said. ``Talk to Leo (Mazzone), see what he
says they like to do.''

 &HT;    HUTCHISON OIL AMENDMENT HITS SNAG
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dancing a parliamentary two-step Tuesday evening,
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, worked to salvage an amendment
protecting oil companies that drill in public lands from paying
higher royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison had hoped to delay any changes in federal royalty
rules until the year 2001, when a new and possibly more
oil-friendly president is in office.
</P>
<P>
   But her amendment, attached to an Interior Department
appropriations bill, got snagged in a procedural dispute after
Democrats insisted that the Senate comply with a rule banning such
``riders'' from spending measures. Aides said Hutchison was
adjusting the language of her measure in hopes of winning its
approval later.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, meanwhile, postponed action on the Interior bill
until late this week at the soonest.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's proposed moratorium would save major energy
companies an estimated $66 million a year in additional royalties.
The Interior Department says that oil companies now underpay fees
for drilling on federal lands because they are calculated on a
``posted price'' set by the companies instead of the actual market
price.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition that includes environmentalists, government waste
watchdog groups and American Indian groups have joined in urging
that the moratorium be lifted. The royalties support a variety of
purposes, including education, conservation and aid to Indian
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, who last week succeeded in attaching three tax breaks
for oil and gas to another bill, has argued that the industry needs
extra support. Although the price of oil has rebounded, she said,
``the industry _ and local economies that the industry supports _
have not.''
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium, if enacted, would be the fourth passed by
Congress to postpone higher fees.
</P>
<P>
   The energy industry is among the most active lobbying power in
Washington. A study by the Center for Responsive Politics estimated
that oil and gas interests spent $93 million on lobbyists in
1997-98 and $14 million in contributions to political candidates.

 WICHITA, Kan.: with research.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still, the impersonation strategy sparked a debate within DSFX.
</P>
<P>
   According to the internal documents, one manager refused to
supervise the investigation because he objected to the subterfuge
on legal and ethical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorandum dated May 22, 1998, the manager, Jim Drinkhall,
wrote, ``This morning, Andy Levetown called to have me manage a
case for Bill Koch where we would have a whole group of reporters
around the country gathering info for us on the Koch Industries
trial, a whistle blower case in Minnesota and an age discrimination
case, in Kansas, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum said that Levetown, a senior manager and lawyer,
saw no problem using reporters and that top management approved the
practice. Elliot Sloane, a spokesman for DSFX, said Levetown could
not discuss the case because of confidentiality restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In a later memorandum, to Bart Schwartz, the DSFX president in
New York, Drinkhall identified two people, Peter Weaver and Michael
Connors, as claiming to be covering the Koch case as journalists
while actually providing information to DSFX. Other unidentified
reporters across the country were being paid to conduct interviews
saying they were writing articles about Koch Industries'
environmental record, ``but are in fact giving us the results of
the interviews,'' the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   Drinkhall, a former investigative reporter for The Wall Street
Journal, declined to discuss the memos because of confidentiality
restrictions. He left DSFX early this year and works for another
investigative firm.
</P>
<P>
   A fuller portrait of the strategy emerged through court records
and interviews with some of the investigators, reporters who
covered the trial and Koch Industries officials. These sources also
made it clear that this was not the first time private detectives
were enmeshed in this nasty family feud.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hire a lot of private eyes because of what we're up
against,'' Goldstein, the spokesman for William Koch, said. ``We're
up against a very secretive company that operates like a cult.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch Industries is the country's second-largest privately held
business behind Cargill, the grain merchant. It operates oil
refineries, gas pipelines and chemical companies and had revenue of
$30 billion last year. But the company maintains a low public
profile and its executives are rarely quoted in the press.
</P>
<P>
   The credit for its growth in the last 20 years has gone largely
to Charles Koch, the second-oldest of four brothers, who serves as
chairman and lives quietly in Wichita. But the prosperity has
sparked a series of lawsuits by William, the most flamboyant
brother, who is best known for financing the America's Cup victory
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that Charles and another brother, David, cheated him
and other shareholders out of $1 billion when they bought out their
interests in the company in 1983. William has filed at least 10
suits against Koch Industries and family members, including one
against his mother shortly before her death and another that is
scheduled for trial this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, William has hired private detectives to do
everything from investigate claims that Koch Industries was
cheating customers to collect trash outside the homes of company
lawyers. The trash collection was halted after security guards
caught an investigator trying to buy trash from the law firm's
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Court files show that Koch paid $5,000 for two investigators to
collect the trash. Among their expenses were $20 to a garbage truck
driver for bags of trash and $18.73 for rubber gloves and masks.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit, Koch said he hired the investigators to look
for evidence that Koch Industries was spying on him and his
employees. For instance, he said, one of his consultants was
subjected to surveillance and harassment by investigators for Koch
Industries and suggested that documents had been stolen from his
offices. The company has denied both accusations.
</P>
<P>
   It was last summer's trial in Topeka, Kan., that spawned the use
of investigators pretending to be journalists, according to the
DSFX records and interviews with participants in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   What the investigators hoped to gain remains unclear, though
Koch Industries officials would be more likely to share information
with a journalist than a private investigator working for William.
One memo said there were suspicions that company lawyers were
providing reporters with documents protected by a court order.
Also, William complained repeatedly that reporters were biased
against him and he may have thought infiltrating them would prove
his hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   One journalist identified in DSFX records as providing
information to the firm was Peter Weaver, a freelance business
writer in Bethesda, Md., who worked for Forbes magazine many years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to DSFX in January 1998, he sought investigative
work and described using his reputation as a financial reporter to
gain access to corporate insiders for other clients. ``Let's see if
we can come up with a challenging assignment where I can employ my
investigative skills and coveted list of sources to your
advantage,'' he wrote, according to a copy of the letter
distributed to DSFX offices nationwide and obtained by The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said in an interview that he was working on a profile of
William Koch for George magazine and provided an e-mail he sent to
the magazine outlining his story proposal. He said the assignment
was based on speculation that Koch would run for the U.S. Senate
and when he decided not to run it was canceled. DSFX helped him
identify sources for the article, Weaver said, and he later sold
the firm information. He said that he saw no conflict in his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some pay for my interviews and things I was going to use
in my story and I sold it to them,'' he said. ``I did get
something, but it was nothing like I would have gotten for the
story.''

 WICHITA, Kan.: the story.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Connors, a former Denver Post reporter and part-time
journalist, was hired primarily to see if company lawyers were
leaking confidential material to reporters, according to one DSFX
memo.
</P>
<P>
   Connors attended most of the 11-week trial last summer in
Topeka. Reporters covering the trial, including Leslie Wayne of The
New York Times and Bob Cox of The Wichita Eagle, said he told them
he was writing a book about the Kochs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connors showed up at the trial and said he wanted to write a
book,'' said Cox, now at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. ``I had
lunch with him a couple times and kept asking who his publisher was
and he was pretty evasive.''
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, Connors wrote to Koch Industries requesting
interviews with executives. He enclosed copies of some of his
articles, including one for Time magazine, according to a copy of
the letter provided by Koch Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Connors said in an interview that he works as a private
investigator and freelance writer, but insisted that he attended
the trial only as a journalist. He said the book is on hold and
declined to identify the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a journalist and I am an investigator,'' he said. ``I do
both, but never at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   A Web site run by a Dallas private investigation firm identifies
Connors as an employee. Jack Taylor Jr., a former reporter who is
now a licensed private detective, runs the firm. Though Taylor's
name does not appear in the DSFX memos, two people involved in the
Koch investigation said he also worked for DSFX as a subcontractor.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said in an interview that his involvement in the Koch
matter was as a journalist and declined to say whether he worked
for Koch or DSFX. ``Texas law prohibits a private investigator from
revealing anything at all about a client or work done on behalf of
a client without the client's permission, even in a court of law,''
he said. (Goldstein said Koch would not grant permission for
investigators to discuss work they may have done for him.)
</P>
<P>
   Reporters covering the Koch case said Taylor told them he was
working on a long article about the family. Cox, the former Wichita
reporter, said Taylor contacted him before the Koch trial, saying
he was considering writing an article and asking for sensitive Koch
Industries documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started quizzing me about various people and he wanted to
see a document that had been leaked to us that had been prepared by
Koch Industries purporting to expose Bill's record as an
employee,'' Cox said. ``Jack really wanted to get his hands on that
document.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is well known in investigative reporting circles, having
worked at The Daily Oklahoman, The Dallas Times Herald and The Los
Angeles Daily News. Cox said he knew him as a reporter and member
of Investigative Reporters &AMP; Editors, an organization for
journalists and educators. Still, he declined to give him the
document.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, the Topeka jury decided in favor of Koch
Industries, but another trial was set for this year in Tulsa,
Okla., and William was still interested in pillorying the company.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, Taylor sent packages of negative information about
the company, including videotape spliced together from depositions
for the upcoming trial, to at least 10 reporters in Kansas,
Oklahoma and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A business card attached to the package identified Taylor as a
journalist, and in a memo he wrote that he discovered the
information while working as a freelance writer for someone who was
concerned about the environment. He suggested that the reporters
might be interested in the material.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said in the interview that he did not distribute the
material as a private investigator, but he still declined to say
who paid him. ``I did it as a journalist and was paid as a
journalist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A search of newspapers in the region turned up one article based
on the material, in Indian Country Today, America's largest Indian
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor acknowledged sending the information to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The search could not determine whether other coverage of Koch
Industries was affected by the information. However, officials at
Koch Industries said they suspect other negative articles were
based on the information.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to influence the press another way, a private
detective in Washington working for DSFX provided much of the same
information to a reporter at The Wall Street Journal, according to
the detective, who spoke on condition that his name be withheld
because of his confidentiality agreement. He said he expected a
$25,000 fee if he succeeded in persuading the reporter to write a
negative article.
</P>
<P>
   The detective identified the reporter as John Fialka, an
investigative reporter in the Journal's Washington bureau. Fialka
acknowledged that he was friends with the detective and that they
had discussed Koch Industries briefly, but he declined to describe
the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't discuss projects that we're working on, especially to
The New York Times,'' Fialka said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, the spokesman for William Koch, said a private
investigator had sought a fee for placing a negative story, but
Koch rejected the offer. ``If you're saying Bill has a bounty
system for stories, you're wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Rosser, director of communications at Koch Industries, said
Fialka has been working on an article about the company since last
spring.

BENEDICT WOLF, 94, NEGOTIATOR ON THE FEDERAL LABOR BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., in next-to-last graf, phrase `of counsel' is CQ) 
(sw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Benedict Wolf, a New York lawyer and veteran mediator
who served on the original federal labor board, died on Friday at
his home in Manhattan. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf was summoned to Washington from his private New York
practice in 1933 to become executive officer of a newly formed
National Labor Board. Under the chairmanship of Sen. Robert F.
Wagner, it brought together representatives of business and labor
unions to settle disputes, and Wolf acted as Wagner's legal
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, a Democrat, was a principal architect of President
Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation. His interest in
protecting working people from unfair labor practices during the
Depression led to the formation in 1935 of a more structured
National Labor Relations Board with branches around the country.
</P>
<P>
   One of Wolf's final tasks with the earlier board took him back
to New York, where 200,000 elevator operators and building-service
employees were preparing to strike in February 1935. Foreseeing
health hazards and a crippled economy, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia
marshaled the Police and Fire Departments to keep the city moving,
but negotiators, including Wolf, narrowly averted the walkout in a
long night of contract bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf became the executive secretary and chief trial examiner of
the new labor board. He oversaw the board's administrative and
field staffs and kept close contact with its 22 regional boards.
</P>
<P>
   The system was functioning in the uncharted territory of a new
law, the Labor Relations Act, and Wolf traveled coast to coast to
see that the board was working as intended. He organized and
oversaw a staff of trial examiners who fanned out across the
country to conduct hearings when violations of the act were
alleged. He regularly reported to the members of the board about
its operations and the affairs of the regional branches.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to private practice in 1937 but kept up his role as
an independent labor mediator and arbitrator for several more years
and later served on the New York State Mediation Board.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict Wolf, a native of Woodridge, N.Y., was a 1925 graduate
of City College, where he played football and contributed to its
literary magazine. While at Columbia Law School, he also pursued a
master of arts program and received degrees in law and English
literature in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945 he was a founder of what is now the Manhattan firm of
Wolf Popper, to which he remained of counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's wife, Miriam Jacobi Wolf, died in 1995 after 67 years of
marriage. He is survived by his daughter, Dr. Deborah W. Tanzer,
and three grandsons.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: CORPORATE CLIENTS WIN INTERNET FARES; ELECTRONIC
BOOKS; JAPAN'S MILLENNIUM TESTS; GREEN IN MICHIGAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also moving in `t' category) 
(yn) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines' decision last week to make its discount
Internet fares available to corporate customers appears to have
been an important victory for travel managers, who are always
looking to hold down business fares.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the pressure behind Delta's decision was applied by the
National Business Travel Association, which had argued that those
fares should be made available to corporations and that such
bookings should count toward the volume quotas that determine the
size of discounts that corporations negotiate with the airlines.
(Internet fares, which are typically lower than negotiated fares,
seldom appear in computerized reservations systems.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Northwest Airlines said it would soon test
negotiated rates and Internet fares for three corporations through
its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two months ago, Mark Johnson, the president of the travel
association, wrote to the major airlines to ask them to load
Internet fares into the computerized reservations systems so that
companies would have access to them. Delta's decision was announced
at the travel association's annual convention last week, even
though it will probably not go into effect until December.
</P>
<P>
   When Delta's plan does go into effect, it is expected to bypass
the computerized reservations systems in favor of its Sky Links
site and electronic tickets. The airline said traditional ticketing
costs $500,000 a year and is four times more expensive than booking
through its on-line site. Delta also hopes to implement a system of
direct payment that will eliminate credit card fees.
</P>
<P>
   But even while some details remain to be worked out, Norman
Sherlock, executive director of the National Business Travel
Association, said Delta's decision was a ``very significant
initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We've been talking to other carriers, and we believe
they'll follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Books
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next Monday, British Airways passengers in first-class
or business-class lounges at O'Hare International Airport in
Chicago will be able to pick up an electronic book filled with the
equivalent of 400 pages of daily newspapers, current magazines,
financial information and perhaps even novels or nonfiction books.
Daily newspapers and financial information will be downloaded twice
a day. The e-books, as they are called, weigh 22 ounces and, at 7
by 6 inches, fit comfortably into a reader's hand.
</P>
<P>
   The trial period will last a month, while the airline gauges
consumer reaction with the goal of putting the books in its lounges
at all 22 U.S. airports to which it flies. It also is planning to
make e-books available on British Airways flights worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually passengers will be able to check out the e-books
before their departure flights and return them upon reaching their
destination, or when they complete their journey. If all goes well,
passengers will be able to phone and request a specific book or
books, to be downloaded into the e-book which they can pick up at
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium Tests
</P>
<P>
   Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways and Japan Air System each say
they have completed their Year 2000 computer tests and are now
fully compliant. Nevertheless the Japan Travel Bureau, the nation's
biggest travel agency, said it would not sell package tours with
flights that are scheduled to be in the air midnight Greenwich mean
time on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, the agency said, is concern that other countries
will not be fully compliant, and it ``puts the safety of its
customers first.'' The agency said it might reconsider, however, if
the International Civil Aviation Organization declared the world to
be 100 percent safe from the Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   Green in Michigan
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard for some to believe, especially when they think
of the Upper Peninsula in winter, but Michigan is now one of the
top golfing states. A 1998 report, recently released by the
National Golf Foundation, placed Michigan eighth nationally, behind
Florida, South Carolina, California, Texas, North Carolina, Arizona
and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who travel primarily to play golf, it trailed only
Florida, South Carolina, Texas and North Carolina. Michigan
officials say it has more public golf courses than any other state,
nearly 800, and that golfers contribute almost $1 billion annually
to the state's economy.

MONEY IS THE TOPIC AS GOLFERS HINT OF A RYDER CUP BOYCOTT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the United States battles Europe at the Ryder Cup in late
September, there may be a battle between the U.S. Ryder Cup players
and the PGA of America.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is money. This fall's Ryder Cup at the Country Club in
Brookline, Mass., will be the most profitable event in golf
history. An article in the September issue of Golf Digest reports
that the event will gross an estimated $63 million, while the PGA
of America, the organization conducting the competition, is
expected to net between $16.5 million and $17.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Players are not paid to compete in the Ryder Cup, nor do they
have a direct say in how the profits are spent. That does not sit
well with many of the golfers, who believe that they should be
paid, or that they should be allowed to allocate a significant
amount of money to the charity of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   In the Golf Digest article, David Duval, the world's
second-ranked golfer, suggested some players could boycott the
Ryder Cup if the money dispute was not settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could happen this September,'' Duval said when asked about
the possibility of a Ryder Cup boycott. ``More than likely, though,
next time in 2001. Certainly within two more. It's imminent. This
is just from talking to the guys. Some of them are fed up.''
</P>
<P>
   A boycott by Ryder Cup players would be a drastic move and a
potential public relations nightmare for everyone involved. The
players questioning the current system would prefer that their
complaints lead to a revised form of profit sharing.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara was one of the first players to raise the issue of
paying Ryder Cup players two years ago, and he was sharply
criticized. But O'Meara is not alone in questioning the system.
Duval, Tiger Woods, Scott Hoch, Lee Janzen and Jack Nicklaus are
quoted in the Golf Digest report, expressing various degrees of
dissatisfaction with the situation. Both Woods and Duval insisted
that instead of making money off the event themselves, they would
prefer to see more money go to charity.
</P>
<P>
   For now, players receive a $5,000 stipend to play in the Ryder
Cup. Anyone who makes the team, however, automatically qualifies
for the World Golf Championships, a new event to be played next
month in Akron, Ohio. It is limited to players from this year's
Ryder Cup and last year's Presidents Cup. The purse for the event
will be $5 million, with the winner to earn $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials of the PGA of America have defended the
organization's right to make money, pointing out that it pays for
numerous golf and education programs across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, $2.5 million of its television proceeds go to the
PGA Tour. Jim L. Awtrey, the chief executive officer of the PGA of
America, did not respond to phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it appears that unless the players are given more say
concerning the huge profits generated by this year's Ryder Cup,
this dispute will not go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the players, they're not going to have a Ryder Cup,''
Duval said. ``Let's take some of that big Ryder Cup pot and cut it
up and give it away to charity. That's supposed to be what we're
all about, isn't it? Something has to happen here.''

PLENTY OF MONEY, NOWHERE TO SHOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Next to the major-league fact books, the family
portraits and the potted plant on the shelf behind Kevin Malone's
tidy desk at Dodger Stadium stands a framed, black-and-white photo
of his most illustrious predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   That's a bow-tied, cigar-chomping Branch Rickey looking over
Malone's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey, in the history texts for escorting Jackie Robinson
across baseball's color line, was the Dodgers' general manager in
an era when the man in that chair could reshape his team _ or his
sport _ with a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. And Malone is reminded of that every day as the
Saturday-night trading-deadline approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel that I can do as much as I want to do,'' says the
young GM, not complaining but stating a fact.
</P>
<P>
   Malone doesn't want to change America. He just wants to win a
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   And he must have thought that World Series ring was in reach
after he was hired last summer to run the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Once Malone was the GM in Montreal, where money was so short the
job might include planning the bake sales, and where the fans are
so indifferent, they see a run scored and call it a crease
violation.
</P>
<P>
   Now he sits in the newly furnished executive wing at Dodger
Stadium, watching batting practice through a floor-to-ceiling
window, and the only impossible dream should be emptying Fox's bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   How long did it take Malone to realize that the way baseball
runs its business these days, it's easier to be the GM of the Expos
than the Dodgers?
</P>
<P>
   In Montreal, during the week of a trading deadline, Malone must
have felt like the most popular man in baseball. His filing cabinet
held the contracts of some of the hottest young talent on either
side of the border, and some of the most underpaid, making them
doubly attractive to rival GMs.
</P>
<P>
   If Malone figured he could get something by trading Carlos
Perez, there would have been no big contract to poison a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But if Malone wants to get rid of Perez now, the problem isn't
only the sky-high earned-run average (7.43) but also the contract
that promises the pitcher $12.5 million over the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And why single out Perez? The same problem applies to many of
the most trade-worthy Dodgers _ those high price tags they carry
around like radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   There's Eric Young, the second baseman who can't turn a double
play and is owed $4.5 million each of the next two seasons. There's
Jose Vizcaino, the platoon second baseman who's really a puffed-up
utility infielder and makes $3.5 million next year. There's Devon
White, the 36-year-old center fielder who attacks the wall only
when the ball's already over it and has $4 million and $5 million
years ahead. There are left fielder Gary Sheffield ($9.5 million
for each of the next four years), first baseman Eric Karros ($5.5
million next year) and Raul Mondesi ($9.5 million in 2000, $11
million in 2001), who would otherwise be the tastiest Dodgers trade
bait.
</P>
<P>
   As for closer Jeff Shaw, he has a no-trade contract.
</P>
<P>
   Each of them _ in fact, every Dodgers regular _ is under
contract for next season as well. If they were in first place, that
would be a blessing. Since they're in last, the that fact none of
them will be leaving for free agency means Malone is boxed in all
winter as well.
</P>
<P>
   Malone never had the luxury of dealing in long-term contracts
and seven-figure salaries in Quebec, or the headaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though you had limited financial resources, you still had
the resource of young players,'' he says of the simple life he left
behind in Montreal. ``So you always had clubs interested in your
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Expos lacked the Canadian dollars to hold onto those
players, there wasn't much question that saying ``yes'' to trades
for prospects was the way to go. Malone was under no pressure to
win every year, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dodgers, it's a little more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the money, but we don't have the way to spend it. I
can't just go out and get who I want,'' Malone says. ``It's almost
like not having the resources. It's almost like Montreal.''
</P>
<P>
   In Malone's little black book, squarely in front of him on the
desk, the numbers of the 29 other major-league GMs are crammed onto
two pages for quick reference. He estimates he's spending five
hours a day with a phone to his ear, not all of that chatting with
his counterparts. He has talked with ``80 or 90 percent'' of his
rivals in the past two weeks, including a couple of conversations
with San Diego's Kevin Towers, that most outspoken of Malone's
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes both lines are ringing and the cell phone is
ringing. But it's not always GMs wanting to make deals,'' Malone
says. ``Sometimes it's the media asking if something is going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The likely answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten clubs are probably looking to add a player. Ten clubs are
looking to trade if they can find what they're looking for. Ten
will stand pat,'' Malone says. ``When we won eight out of 10
(earlier in the month), we were more in a mode to add a player.''
</P>
<P>
   After Monday night's 5-3, 10-inning loss to Cincinnati, the
Dodgers had lost six of seven. Now they're in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're in a mode to unload (veterans),'' Malone
says. ``We like our talent level. This is the club we've committed
to. We're probably in the stand-pat category.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Committed'' is a nice way of saying big salaries and long-term
contracts make the trades the Dodgers would like darned-near
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably a little strong,'' Malone says of my
translation.
</P>
<P>
   A little.
</P>
<P>
   Remember this before you assume money is no object for the
Dodgers' new owners. Overpay a player and the team might be stuck
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Remember this before you say Malone should just dump the
Dodgers' dead weight and pick up, let's say, Alex Rodriguez.
Turning this season around, or overhauling the roster for 2000,
won't be as easy as picking up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to give the fans something to cheer about the
rest of the season,'' Malone says.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck to him. And if Branch Rickey pops out of that picture
frame and decides to try the life of a GM in the '90s, good luck to
him, too. &QL;

FORMER CHIEF OF GE CAPITAL PLANS TO START BUYOUT FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary C. Wendt, who built GE Capital Services into a financial
powerhouse before leaving last year in a management shake-up, is
planning a buyout and private-equity investment fund that he would
run with other former GE Capital executives.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt expects to focus on Europe and Japan, two areas that have
attracted attention from big U.S. investors because of the large
amount of nonperforming Japanese debt, estimated at as much as $1
trillion, and the quickening pace of reorganizations and takeover
activity in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued late Tuesday, Wendt confirmed a Bloomberg
News report about his plans, saying he had not determined how much
money he would try to raise. He added that if he was able to garner
enough to begin a fund, he and his partners ``will not focus only
on highly leveraged investments but will stress operating
management, not simply financial acumen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendt, 57, declined to comment further on his plans, as did Paul
Street, a former senior executive at GE Capital and Lazard Freres,
who is expected to be part of the group. But a person close to the
situation said the group would seek to raise more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At GE Capital, Wendt built a reputation as a dynamic executive
who made the company into the biggest and most profitable unit of
General Electric. In his dozen years at the helm, profits at the
unit rose to nearly $4 billion from $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a messy divorce from his high school sweetheart,
Lorna J. Wendt, that ultimately gave him a higher national profile.
In their divorce proceedings, Mrs. Wendt rejected a settlement
offer of $10 million and sought half of Wendt's net worth, which
her lawyer estimated could be more than $100 million. In December
1997, a judge in Connecticut awarded Mrs. Wendt $20 million _ half
the Wendts' hard assets _ but a smaller part of Wendt's stock
options and future pension benefits. To many, her legal fight came
to serve as an exercise in determining the true economic value of a
corporate spouse.
</P>
<P>
   And despite Wendt's success at running GE Capital, he was said
to have had a strained relationship with John F. Welch, GE's chief
executive. During the divorce proceedings, for example, Wendt
acknowledged that he and Welch were not close. And in December,
when Wendt departed, Welch said that Wendt had not been considered
a candidate to replace him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   GE Capital has been very active in Japan, most recently buying
$11 billion in commercial loans from the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan. But a person close to Wendt's group said it would stay away
from the sort of investments that might also draw GE's interest.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Wendt's group would join a long list of U.S.
investment funds that have sought to cash in on the growing number
of takeovers, spinoffs and other reorganizations brought on, in
part, by the monetary union. Buyout firms that have set up offices
in Europe or begun funds recently include Apollo Advisors; the
Carlyle Group; Clayton, Dubilier &AMP; Rice; Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst;
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts; Texas Pacific Group; and Warburg Pincus.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Blanks, a partner in Hicks, Muse, a Dallas buyout firm that
is putting together a $1.5-billion European fund, said that
according to IFR Securities, total mergers and acquisition activity
in Europe has risen fourfold since 1984, to almost $600 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe is really undergoing a fundamental change,'' Blanks
said. ``The watchword has become, `Get big, become competitive, or
lose out.'''

GORY `DEEP BLUE SEA' IS BORING, BRAINLESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After making two legendary flops in a row _
``Cutthroat Island'' and ``The Long Kiss Goodnight'' _ action
director Renny Harlin has pulled out all stops in trying to make
his killer-shark movie, ``Deep Blue Sea,'' into an
audience-pleasing, late-summer blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   If the audience is in a bloodthirsty mood, it could well work at
the box office. The film is a gauntlet of giant sharks jumping out
and gobbling up cast members regularly every 10 minutes or so, and
the visual effects are fairly convincing.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a no-brainer if there ever was one _ so broadly comedic
and filled with macho bluster that it's basically a cartoon, and
such a clumsy ripoff of ``Jaws'' and other, better films that it
often plays like a Zucker Brothers parody: ``Shark! _ the Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about an aquatic research facility off the coast of Baja
California where a group of scientists and medical researchers are
working with giant mako sharks, under the theory their primitive
but resilient brains hold a cure for Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   But when the beautiful scientist heroine (Saffron Burrows)
secretly expands the creatures' brain capacity, they instantly
become so intelligent that, when a big storm temporarily
immobilizes the lab, the creatures more or less take over the place
and go after the humans.
</P>
<P>
   From here, the movie turns into a low-rent version of ``The
Poseidon Adventure'' with one ghoulishly mutilating shark attack
after another and a couple of clever and unexpected developments
along the way to give the illusion of originality.
</P>
<P>
   But it lacks real characters, drama and suspense. And we never
know where the endangered humans are trying to get to in their
flight, or how many of the intelligent killer sharks are after
them. As a result, the film is so uninvolving as basic storytelling
that it quickly becomes boring.
</P>
<P>
   Critical disclaimer: I have to acknowledge that ``Deep Blue
Sea'' could be somewhat better than it played to me, since I had
the handicap of seeing it Monday night at Seattle's City Centre
Cinemas with what may have been the rowdiest audience ever
recruited for a critic's screening.
</P>
<P>
   The entire row in front of me talked non-stop in loud voices,
yelled at the screen, often stood up to make gestures, passed a
bottle in a brown paper sack back and forth _ and, at one point,
broke into a small fight. Cellular phones rang throughout the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   When I fled to a seat in the rear of the auditorium, a man
sitting next to me received no less than seven cell phone calls,
and, at one point even (so help me) phoned a friend to describe how
the movie was progressing. I had a distinct feeling I was
witnessing the end of the movies as we know them.
</P>
<P>

   LITTLE-KNOWN STOCKS GAIN ON USUALLY RELIABLE ONES
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1990s, individual investors have gotten rich in
the stock market by sticking to a couple of relatively simple
strategies: buying big-name companies whose products they know or
use and piling into stocks that have already been big winners.
</P>
<P>
   But these strategies appear to be losing steam. Some of the
stocks that have been the hottest _ companies as diverse as America
Online, Pfizer, Yahoo, Gillette and Dell Computer _ are down
considerably from their highs of earlier this year. Many of these
stocks have been outrun by companies few investors have ever heard
of.

   CHINA AND U.S. HOLD TRADE TALKS
</P>
<P>
   China and the United States held trade talks in Beijing and
agreed to higher-level discussions later this year, a new sign of
slowly thawing relations. But they remained frozen on the most
prominent issue _ China's proposed entry into the World Trade
Organization. Deputy Commerce Secretary David Aaron met with
Chinese officials to discuss commercial issues. Yet the Chinese
only talked about trade organization membership indirectly, Aaron
said, and they showed no willingness to establish a timetable for
new negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the House renewed trading privileges with China for
another year, separating United States commercial interests from a
long list of grievances Washington has with Beijing.

   CHICAGO _ With Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley set to address the Rev. Jesse Jackson's coalition of civil
rights groups and urban activists next week, Jackson says he will
not endorse either candidate for the Democratic presidential
nomination until he sees which one seems more effective in
championing causes he considers crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not who will I endorse,'' Jackson said in an
interview here. ``The issue is whether they will endorse the
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley will have an opportunity to do that next week
at a four-day national conference of Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition, where each candidate will give a speech. Officials with
both campaigns said they considered the conference an important
chance for them to address Jackson's core African-American and
liberal urban audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to work very hard to get his support and earn his
support,'' said Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the vice president.
``We're absolutely not going to take anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who sought the Democratic nomination for president in
1984 and 1988 and is often mentioned as a potential candidate,
decided this spring not to run in 2000. He wants to use his
platform and political stature to influence the election from the
outside and ``set the climate for policy,'' he said on Monday at
the South Side headquarters of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the
organization he founded more than 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says he wants to make sure the candidates _ and not
necessarily just the Democrats _ feel compelled to focus on issues
like health insurance for the poor, workers' rights, affirmative
action and more money for urban schools.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 57, said he decided not to run for president this time
because campaign financing has distorted the political process,
candidates are not as free to express controversial opinions and
non-candidates have greater ``moral authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, another reason is that it seemed clear he could not
win. Nonetheless, political analysts consider Jackson an important
figure in Democratic politics, one who is seen much less as a
controversial gadfly than as someone whose influence with potential
voters has increased in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   David Bositis, a senior policy analyst at the Joint Center for
Political and Economic Studies, has been gauging Jackson's
popularity in surveys he has conducted in each of the last four
years. He said that whites are increasingly seeing Jackson in a
positive light.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 30 percent of whites surveyed viewed Jackson favorably
and 50 percent viewed him unfavorably, Bositis said. In a 1999
survey to be published in the next week or so, 57 percent of whites
viewed Jackson favorably and 29 percent regarded him unfavorably.
Bositis also said more self-described conservatives gave Jackson
favorable ratings than unfavorable ones.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that Jackson's improved image is partly due to the
man himself and partly a reflection of the political climate. In
the 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton, determined to show he
was not a traditional liberal Democrat, seemed to make a point of
distancing himself from Jackson and the black electorate by
criticizing Sister Souljah, a rap performer who once suggested that
blacks kill whites, at a Rainbow/PUSH Coalition convention. Now,
analysts and Democratic strategists say, the party appears more
well-rounded and the nation's strong economy makes Jackson's talk
about helping the disadvantaged seem less threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the national level there is no longer a sense that you're
going to be opening up the public coffers to tons of welfare
recipients if you say what Jesse Jackson agrees with,'' said Rachel
Gorlin, a Democratic consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are less wary of Jackson. His role as Clinton's spiritual
adviser during the Monica Lewinsky scandal has given his religious
persona a higher profile, Bositis said. Jackson's campaign to
encourage corporate investment in urban neighborhoods has
introduced him to more business leaders. And his recent role in
freeing three American soldiers captured in Yugoslavia enhanced
Jackson's public image, even if his intervention rankled the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gorlin says he has evolved ``from being a figure who was
able to inspire fear'' to a point ``where he's almost reached a
statesman's status.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to be a bogeyman,'' she added, ``and that's no longer
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Praising both Democratic candidates, Jackson, known for his
lyrical, passionate speaking style, suggested that the
less-than-galvanizing personalities of Bradley and Gore would not
hinder their campaign success.
</P>
<P>
   He described Bradley, who has talked a lot about racial issues,
as ``a very bright guy'' who ``has integrity'' and has ``sought to
deal with real issues.'' He said Bradley's ``background, as a
scholar, as an athlete, as a senator has given him the good
qualities of a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman, said the two men have ``known
each other a long time'' and ``have a lot of respect for each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson clearly has a closer relationship with Gore. Although
the two were rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination in
1988, Jackson said the campaign ultimately started a friendship
that was strengthened when Jackson comforted Gore after his son,
Albert III, almost died in an automobile accident in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has supported Jackson's son, Jesse Jr., an Illinois
congressman and has hired several former Jackson campaign
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so smart and so well-prepared,'' Jackson said. ``Gore has
been preparing his whole life for high national service.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was careful not to tip his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exhibition season,'' Jackson said. ``I want to see how
the game is played.''

BASEBALL UMPIRES' RESIGNATION STRATEGY DISINTEGRATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An effort by major league umpires to force early negotiations
for a new labor contract disintegrated Tuesday when they
collectively rescinded the resignations they had submitted to Major
League Baseball earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which came late in the afternoon after a legal setback
in a court challenge in Philadelphia, left the union membership
severely split and one-third of its members without jobs. It
appears too late for some of the umpires to regain their positions
because the National and American Leagues had already hired 25 new
umpires.
</P>
<P>
   The development is a significant blow to the umpires in their
effort to get baseball officials to negotiate with them, and a
signal that their strategy of mass resignation had failed. The
union had embarked on the resignation strategy because its labor
agreement with the leagues bars the umpires from striking. More
than 50 umpires of the 66-member union signed letters of
resignation, effective Sept. 2, at a meeting July 14, but some
almost immediately changed their minds and reversed their
positions.
</P>
<P>
   But 33 of 36 National League umpires and nine of 32 American
League umpires (two of whom are not union members) stuck to their
resignations until Tuesday when they withdrew them ``without
prejudice,'' meaning they could reinstate them. However, many of
them won't have a chance. A baseball official said the American
League, which has hired 12 new umpires, sent letters to its nine
umpires Monday notifying them that their resignations had been
accepted. The National League in recent days hired 13 minor league
umpires, meaning it has 49 umpires for 36 positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Len Coleman has to make some decisions,'' another baseball
official said, referring to the NL president. ``There are going to
be certain guys who aren't going to have jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The union reversed its strategy after Judge Edmund Ludwig of
U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, during a series of conference
calls with baseball's lawyers and Richard Phillips, the union's
lawyer and chief negotiator, refused to grant the union a temporary
restraining order. The union had filed a lawsuit the previous day
asking, among other things, that the umpires be permitted to
withdraw their resignations up until the effective date.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ludwig urged the two sides to arrange an interim truce.
After the last call, Phillips held a second conference call with
the umpires and recommended that they rescind their resignations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richie said he knows we'll take some hits for changing our
position,'' Bruce Froemming, an NL umpire and a member of the
union's board of directors, said by telephone from Atlanta. ``But
we changed our position to move the process forward and open up a
dialogue between the parties. We wanted to show baseball that we
are now in position to talk and that we're not threatening
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips' ability to negotiate a new agreement could be
severely hampered by the division that has been created in the
union, mostly by AL umpires who object to his hammerlike
negotiating style.
</P>
<P>
   Naming the two umpires considered to be leaders of the dissident
group, Froemming said, ``I think John Hirschbeck and Joe Brinkman
have caused us a lot of problems. To go off on their own, when the
vote was 49 to 14 to support Richie, I don't think is healthy for
us.'' He referred to a vote last February to extend Phillips'
contract.
</P>
<P>
   One umpire who voted against Phillips, speaking on the condition
that he not be identified, said Tuesday, ``Richie is caught in a
time warp, using ice picks and baseball bats to drive his points
home. While that was good in '79 and subsequent years, we're
dealing with a new culture in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   At their July 14 meeting, Phillips recommended the resignation
strategy because he thought Major League Baseball would initiate
negotiations for a contract to replace the one that expires Dec. 31
rather than lose the umpires and have to play the final month of
the season and the postseason, including the World Series, with
minor league umpires.
</P>
<P>
   However, the union miscalculated because baseball officials did
not react to the mass resignation, maintaining official silence for
the past two weeks
</P>
<P>
   Phillips did not return a telephone call seeking comment, but he
issued a statement in which he referred to ``this very unseemly
affair that was deliberately provoked by Major League Baseball.''
He also said the union was pursuing unfair labor practice charges
with the National Labor Relations Board.

GIULIANI VISITS LIKELY SENATE OPPONENT'S ONE-TIME HOME TURF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS throughout with new reporting that adds quotes from Clinton
spokesman, Giuliani, Huckabee; adds perspective on potential
Giuliani-Clinton Senate race; adds quotes from Little Rock

afternoon meetings in Arkansas.) (js) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani stood
on the porch of Hillary Rodham Clinton's former home here Tuesday
morning, proclaimed his admiration for the people of Arkansas and
brushed aside the notion that his journey into the heart of Clinton
country was a gigantic publicity stunt to poke fun at his potential
opponent in next year's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in my personality to do anything like that,'' the
famously combative mayor said as he suppressed a smile.
</P>
<P>
   To thank Gov. Mike Huckabee and his other Republican hosts for
their hospitality, Giuliani then announced that he would fly the
Arkansas flag over City Hall for a few days _ an order that was
carried out within hours back in New York City. .
</P>
<P>
   Denials aside, Giuliani's trip here was clearly designed to
underscore his contention that Mrs. Clinton, who has never lived in
the state where she is planning to run for Senate, is a political
carpetbagger. But for most of his visit, the big city mayor played
straight man as Huckabee delivered the punch lines against the
first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never been here before, he's never worked here, he's
never lived here,'' Huckabee said as Giuliani's aides smirked.
``Today he will be announcing his candidacy for some significant
major office in Arkansas, we're told.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's trip _ which had its origins in an offhand response
several weeks ago by Giuliani to Mrs. Clinton's ``listening tour''
in New York _ was the latest odd spectacle in the nascent Senate
campaign. The unofficial race has already seen the first lady
traipsing around upstate New York discussing the tribulations of
dairy farming, and Tuesday it featured the Brooklyn-born Giuliani
cheered on by Arkansas Republicans whose Deep South conservatism is
far from his more moderate stances.
</P>
<P>
   But while the two-day trip was billed as a fund-raising tour of
the South, Giuliani's six hours in Little Rock Tuesday seemed more
like a traveling circus, or at least a chaotic movie shoot. Local
camera crews shot footage of out-of-town camera crews. Out-of town
reporters interviewed local reporters. And Giuliani's press
secretary, Sunny Mindel, gleefully snapped pictures of them all.
</P>
<P>
   At the Governor's Mansion, as reporters and aides wilted in the
91-degree heat, waiters served pink lemonade and chocolate cookies
under a magnolia tree. And just outside the fancy iron gates _ near
a bust of a smiling former Gov. Bill Clinton _ a group of women who
called themselves The Vast Right Wing Conspiracy waved signs shaped
like hogs that read, ``Razorbacks for Rudy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so tired of Bill and Hillary's scandals and we think
Rudy has done a good job'' said Jamie Simmons, who said she and the
other sign-wavers had traveled from Memphis, Tenn., to catch a
glimpse of Giuliani. ``We are probably more conservative than he
is, but if it's between him and her, he is the man for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Huckabee eagerly played his part, saying he was ``extremely
thrilled'' to have Giuliani as a guest and plying him with gifts,
including an ``Arkansas Traveler'' certificate that he said
designated the mayor as an official resident of the state.
</P>
<P>
   After touring the public rooms of the Governor's Mansion,
Giuliani proceeded to a fund-raising lunch at the Capital Hotel,
where 62 people paid $500 each for filet mignon and a 15-minute
speech in which the mayor boasted of his success as a Republican in
a largely Democratic city. The lunch raised about $40,000 for
Giuliani's political committee, and his aides predicted that he
would pull in at least $90,000 more at fund-raising events in New
Orleans Tuesday night and in Alabama on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Giuliani's trip, Howard Wolfson, spokesman for the
Clinton campaign's exploratory committee, said only, ``Instead of
playing politics, Hillary Clinton is listening to New Yorkers and
focusing on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the interest of reporters and politicians, many
people here seemed completely indifferent to Giuliani's six-hour
visit. Callers to the morning talk shows were more interested in
debating whether a portion of a downtown street should be renamed
after President Clinton. Shopkeepers and cabdrivers said they
barely knew who Giuliani was.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even some of the people who had written checks to his political
committee said they knew him only as the former prosecutor who had
cleaned up New York City. ``He's gone about things in a proper
manner,'' said Roger Crowe Gravis, a rice and soybean farmer who
came to the lunch in a seersucker suit. ``I think he'd be a credit
to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Freeman, who owns a software manufacturing company in
Jonesboro, Ark., 90 minutes from Little Rock, said that while
Hillary Clinton was ``really a nice lady,'' he preferred Giuliani's
politics. ``I know his beliefs are just like ours and he is really
a pretty neat guy,'' Freeman said as he emerged beaming from the
lunch with his wife, Lynda. ``What he's done for New York City, he
could do for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   After the fund-raising event, Giuliani spoke before the Arkansas
Federation of Republican Women, whose former president, Joyce
Phillips, introduced him as not only ``one of the most dynamic and
exciting Republican figures on the political horizon'' but ``one of
the most recognizable faces on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   After somberly describing his efforts to cut crime and reduce
the welfare rolls and insisting to the audience that ``I haven't
really thought about Hillary much,'' Giuliani sped off to play a
round of golf with Lt. Gov. Win Paul Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in New York City, mayoral aides had wasted no
time in hoisting the Arkansas flag like a battle pennant over City
Hall, leaving Democratic lawmakers none too pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is politics pushing government a bit too far,'' said
Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker and a Democrat. Told
about Vallone's reaction, Giuliani laughed as if it were the best
joke he had heard all day. He defended his decision to fly the
Arkansas flag as ``an act of reciprocity,'' because the Capital
Hotel, where his fund-raising lunch took place, flew the New York
City flag Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in the sort of weird world of New York politics would
anybody criticize that,'' Giuliani said.

REPUBLICANS PLAN TO SKIP COMMITTEE STEP ON HMO BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders made a tentative decision
Tuesday to bypass their own committees in an effort to push
legislation regulating managed care through the House before the
August Congressional recess.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Republican aides said that Speaker J. Dennis Hastert was
looking to pass a ``modified'' version of legislation that the
Senate approved on a near party-line vote earlier this month and
that Hastert and other Republican leaders wanted the bill to hew as
closely as possible to a Republican package that squeaked by the
House last year on a 216-to-210 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Such a measure would go further than the Senate bill to extend
its consumer protections to 124 million Americans. The Senate, in
many of its provisions, covered 48 million people whose health
plans are rarely the most restrictive kind of managed care
arrangements that have raised most consumer concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But it was far from clear Tuesday night how far the Republican
leadership was willing to go on other divisive issues, like whether
to allow patients to sue their managed care providers in state
courts. Democrats and some Republicans have insisted that a
meaningful managed care bill must have an expansion of the right to
sue, which currently is limited.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican aide said leaders wanted to ``tinker'' with the
Senate bill. Another described the Senate measure as the ``starting
point'' and said it had not yet been decided how much the bill
would change on issues beyond the question of how many people would
be included.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he will veto any patients' protection
measure that resembles the Senate legislation, which he has called
``an empty promise to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Republicans who are doctors and dentists have been
opposing their party's limited approach to regulating managed care.
One of them, Rep. Charlie Norwood, a Georgia dentist, was meeting
with Hastert Tuesday night. Norwood's spokesman, John E. Stone,
said that Norwood was planning to insist that his own consensus
bill _ which in many respects is closer to Democratic legislation _
be brought up for a vote in any floor debate. Stone said Norwood
would continue to fight the ``watered down, do-nothing Senate
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   John P. Feehery, spokesman for Hastert, did not minimize the
difficulties of assembling a Republican bill that could pass the
House given the narrow Republican majority, where a five-vote shift
can defeat any bill. ``The Speaker wants this on the floor next
week,'' he said, ``but it's going to be very, very difficult to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties consider health care issues to be potent with
voters, and the Democrats have been pushing for several years for
comprehensive regulation of the managed care industry and consumer
protections that would apply to all 161 million people with private
health insurance. Republicans have generally sought a more limited
approach.
</P>
<P>
   For months Hastert, who favors a limited approach, had allowed
two separate House committees to wrestle with the issue. But one
committee, which was considering legislation favored by the
leadership, has been stymied by the opposition of Norwood and his
allies.
</P>
<P>
   In another forum, the Commerce Committee, Chairman Thomas J.
Bliley Jr., R-Va., had been trying to negotiate a compromise with
John D. Dingell, D-Mich., who is the lead sponsor of the Democrats'
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis B. Fitzgibbons, an aide to Dingell, said the two had made
``great progress'' on issues such as who is covered and who decides
what care is medically necessary, but had not reached agreement on
questions such as the right to sue. Impatient Republicans, however,
charged that the Democrats were stalling to keep the issue _ and
House inaction _ center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert met with senior Republicans Tuesday. Several senior
Republican staffers said he made plans to take the issue away from
the committees and turn it over to the Rules Committee, which is
essentially an extension of the leadership. They said one member of
the Rules Committee, Rep. Porter J. Goss, R-Fla., was being asked
to act as an ``honest broker'' and assemble a bill that could draw
a Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   The Rules Committee was to begin considering questions on
Thursday about how to structure a health care debate, including
what number and kinds of amendments to allow to the floor. House
Republican leaders hope to hold the vote next week before the House
leaves for an August recess.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are expected to hold firm in favor of their own
approach to managed care, and oppose a more limited Republican
approach. ``If they are going to to hand the Democrats an issue on
this, the Democrats are going to accept it,'' Fitzgibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 20 Republicans are considered possible swing votes on
the issue, most particularly a small group of doctors and dentists
in the House who joined with the American Medical Association to
denounce the Senate Republican bill a few weeks ago. Besides
Norwood, they are Rep. Greg Ganske of Iowa, who is a reconstructive
surgeon, and two other physicians, Rep. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and
Rep. John Cooksey of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood, Coburn and Cooksey voted with their party a year ago,
but have been more rebellious this time around.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders plan to have a party caucus on managed
care Thursday, bringing over Senate Republicans to explain their
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would provide $13 billion in new tax breaks for
health care and give an array of rights to consumers, most
significantly creating an appeals process for 124 million Americans
in employer-sponsored health care plans.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the bill's protections _ such as access to an
emergency room outside of a managed care network, ``timely'' access
to specialists, and direct access to an obstetrician _ apply to
only 48 million people in self-financed plans offered by large
companies.
</P>
<P>
   These are rarely the kind of restrictive HMO arrangements that
have caused the most consumer concern because they channel patients
through a ``gatekeeper'' physician.

THE OTHER BRITTENS, NOT SO WELL KNOWN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a composer, Benjamin Britten is not without detractors among
critics and concertgoers. But by any reasonable measure he is a
major figure, a 20th-century master whose arresting operas,
brilliant symphonic works, inventive chamber music and literate
songs hold deserved places in the repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Britten was also a gifted pianist who brought lucid musical
thinking and unmannered elegance to his playing, particularly as an
accompanist to singers. Murray Perahia, who became a good friend of
the composer in his later years, has said he was in awe of Britten
as a pianist.
</P>
<P>
   He was a fine conductor as well. But except in recordings of his
own music, including most of his operas, this aspect of his work
has not been widely appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   That situation may be about to change. In recent years London
Records, in its Decca Doubles series, has released some remarkable
performances with Britten conducting the English Chamber Orchestra.
These include what have become my favorite recordings of Bach's
``Brandenburg'' Concertos and ``St. John Passion,'' and insightful
performances of Mozart symphonies.
</P>
<P>
   Now BBC Music has issued five remastered CDs, with more to come,
in a series called ``Britten the Performer.'' Most document live
performances, though a few are taken from studio recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The series includes fascinating performances of Mozart,
Tchaikovsky and Mahler. Britten's 1961 performance of the Mahler
Fourth Symphony alone may alter current thinking about this popular
work.
</P>
<P>
   With the range and excellence of Britten's activities as
composer, pianist and conductor, he would be a strong candidate,
and my choice, for Musician of the Century. Of course, the current
rush of best-of-the-century lists is just so much intellectual
banter. But the breadth of Britten's musicianship is striking when
considered in historical context.
</P>
<P>
   This century has produced an unprecedented shift toward
specialization among classical musicians that has been of dubious
value. Pianists, for example, have pushed piano technique to new
realms of prowess. But overall musicianship and the musical
literacy of the public have declined.
</P>
<P>
   There would be lots of candidates for the title Musician of the
19th Century. Back then, a musician was by definition both a
composer and a performer. Chopin could not have spent one minute in
his life fretting over a choice between the two, because there was
no distinction.
</P>
<P>
   My selection for Musician of the 19th Century would probably be
Liszt, an original and influential composer, and by all accounts a
colossal pianist and a superb conductor, who, more than any other
musician of his day, championed the work of other composers. The
possible choices in the 18th century are even more numerous, though
Bach and Mozart are not-too-shabby candidates for the title.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th-century contenders are fewer, because specialization
has so changed the field. A few great musicians, like the pianist
Artur Schnabel and the conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler, both born in
the 19th century, composed regularly, not because they thought
their compositions would necessarily have lasting value but because
that was what musicians did.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Esa-Pekka Salonen, the exciting conductor of the Los
Angeles Philharmonic, is causing jitters among orchestra board
members by insisting that he be given time off to compose. His
works so far suggest that he is more valuable on the podium, but
his desire to keep composing should be encouraged. After all, the
musical understanding he gains by composing greatly enhances his
insight as a conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Who else besides Britten would be a contender? Pierre Boulez for
sure: a major conductor and an influential composer of impressively
wrought works. But Boulez's highly complex compositions will
probably be valued more by musicians and historians than by the
public at large, and reaching the public has to be considered when
it comes to such a populist notion as Musician of the Century.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Bernstein would be another possibility: a dynamic
conductor and, when he put his mind to it, an interesting pianist,
though his esteemed piano teacher, Isabella Vengerova, went to her
grave despairing that her brilliantly talented student did not
practice more.
</P>
<P>
   As a composer of American musicals, theater music and film
scores, Bernstein has certainly reached the public. But his concert
works, though stronger than many critics charge, are not of the
highest distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Ellington was one of the most imposingly complete musicians
ever. Moreover, he was great at improvisation, a skill that also
used to be expected of musicians in earlier times but has
languished among classical artists during this one. Yet though it
has become unfashionable to say so, categories do serve a purpose,
and the jazz tradition in which Ellington was steeped is different
enough to warrant its own debate over the Musician of the Century.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Strauss and Stravinsky are plausible contenders. But
Britten, all things considered, remains my choice, at least within
the classical tradition. And the new releases featuring Britten as
a conductor (the intended topic of today's sermon, if you recall)
fortify the case for his encompassing musicianship.
</P>
<P>
   Britten's achievement as a conductor did not stem from brilliant
technique or even an ability to draw the most sonorous colors from
an orchestra. Rather, he brought the ear and intellect of a great
composer to his conducting. He was alert to unusual harmonic
progressions and the interplay of contrapuntal voices.
</P>
<P>
   Though he cared about faithful rhythmic execution, he cared more
about conveying rhythmic character. Most important, he was
remarkably astute about phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   Phrasing in music is somewhat analogous to sentence structure
and punctuation in prose. Each performer must study a composer's
score to determine its rhetoric, in a sense: How are the musical
sentences grouped? Where does the composer place musical commas, or
periods, or question marks?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These matters are more debatable in a particular piece than
nonmusicians might imagine. And even if phrase groupings are
indisputably clear, how much should a performer demarcate them? How
much time should be taken for that comma or between paragraphs? How
should the sentences flow?
</P>
<P>
   Britten had strong convictions about these questions, as the new
recordings compellingly reveal. The Mahler disk (BBCB 8004-2)
includes the 1961 account of the Fourth Symphony, with the London
Symphony at Orford Church in Suffolk. The English Chamber Orchestra
is the ensemble for the ``Lieder Eines Fahrenden Gesellen,'' with
the soprano Anna Reynolds in a 1972 performance, and two songs from
``Des Knaben Wunderhorn,'' with the soprano Elly Ameling in a 1969
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Mahler renaissance didn't really take hold until the 1950s
and '60s, and Britten was in the vanguard of that movement in
Britain. The scholar Donald Mitchell, who wrote the liner notes for
this recording, quotes a letter Britten wrote in 1944, at 29, in
which he refers to ``my precious Mahler Fourth (which I think I
have more genuine affection for than for any piece in the world).''
</P>
<P>
   That affection comes through here, along with a desire to
present the music with freshness and lucidity. The generally fleet
tempo he takes in the first movement will startle some lovers of
this work. But it rescues the music from the lugubrious melancholy
with which many conductors slather it.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly you hear ingenious structure and rhetorical clarity in
this 15-minute movement. If anything, the general buoyancy makes
the music's ruminative, bittersweet passages, for which Britten
gracefully yields the tempo, seem newly moving.
</P>
<P>
   The third and fourth movements are revelations. Because
Britten's understanding of structure is so keen, he can daringly
prolong the ``ruhevoll'' (``restful'') movement with no loss of
continuity. And in the finale, with its folkloric song setting for
soprano, Britten highlights the music's inner turbulence. Too
often, the song seems like a sweetly bucolic epilogue. Here it
emerges as a fully integrated conclusion to a four-movement
composition.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of the ``Lieder Eines Fahrenden Gesellen,'' sung
with tender simplicity by Ms. Reynolds, Britten shows how
insistently he is willing to articulate phrases. Each four-bar
segment of the theme is carefully shaped and noticeably separated
from the other phrases, lending logic and drama to this deceptively
simple song.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Das Irdische Leben'' from ``Des Knaben Wunderhorn,'' with
Ms. Ameling in rosy voice, Britten's keen ear for detail turns a
seemingly accompanimental orchestral part into something intricate,
shimmering and ominous.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of a wonderful Mozart recording (BBCB 8005-2) is a
1965 performance of the Piano Concerto No. 27 with Sviatoslav
Richter as soloist and Britten conducting the English Chamber
Orchestra. The concert was part of the yearly festival Britten and
his partner the tenor Peter Pears produced in Aldeburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The warmth, breadth and suppleness of the orchestra under
Britten's direction is interestingly contrasted with the cooler,
restrained beauty of Richter's playing. Yet conductor and soloist
are as one in matters of gesture and phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   A Tchaikovsky disk (BBCB 8002-2) contains, among other works,
the Serenade for Strings, in a 1968 performance with the English
Chamber Orchestra that wondrously combines Neo-Classical textural
lightness with vibrantly lyrical phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity of Britten's pianism in a disk of songs, vocal
duets and quartets by Tchaikovsky, Rossini and Brahms, from a
soiree at Aldeburgh (BBCB 8001-2), is not surprising, since his
work as a song accompanist has been well documented in other
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this one is special. An impressive roster of
participating artists sound palpably happy to be making music
together: the soprano Heather Harper, the mezzo Dame Janet Baker,
Pears, the baritone Thomas Hemsley and, sharing the piano-duet
duties in Brahms' ``Liebeslieder,'' Claudio Arrau.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a studio recording of Purcell's ``Dido and Aeneas''
from 1959 (BBCB 8003-2), with Claire Watson and Pears in the title
roles, is a dramatically affecting and musically distinguished
account of a work then overlooked. Britten revered Purcell and
performed his music at a time when knowledge of Baroque performance
practice was largely confined to the groves of academe. Here he
conducts from an edition he prepared with his friend Imogen Holst,
the English editor and composer.
</P>
<P>
   So add Purcell scholar, concert producer and festival organizer
to the list of activities with which this Musician of the Century
involved himself.
</P>
<P>
   I rest my case.

A REFORMER TACKLES INDONESIA'S BARONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The Klub Bimasena at the luxurious
Dharmawangsa Hotel is a tribute to what remains of Indonesia's
conspicuous wealth. Built on the site of the former mint as an
urban refuge for the country's oil barons, it has private suites
with built-in saunas, a lounge serving cognac and cigars and a
spacious gym where each morning Indonesia's repo man, Eko Budianto,
can be found on a treadmill, getting in shape to go after some of
Indonesia's wealthiest people.
</P>
<P>
   Eko, 38, heads the asset management division of the Indonesian
Bank Restructuring Agency, the government agency in charge of an
estimated $35 billion bailout of Indonesia's banks. Eko's job is to
get the corporate cronies who helped create the mess to cough up
roughly $23 billion they owe the banks. If they don't, he has carte
blanche to seize their assets, even if it means enlisting the army
to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself as a loan workout officer with a big stick,'' Eko
said.
</P>
<P>
   Student protests may be more romantic, and investigations into
the ill-gotten wealth of former President Suharto sexier, but the
work being done by Eko and his colleagues at IBRA, as the agency is
known, represents the brass tacks of Indonesia's reformers. IBRA
staff members see themselves as an integral part of that political
transformation, cuff-linked Robin Hoods painstakingly reversing 34
years of government-sanctioned larceny.
</P>
<P>
   It is a staggering task. Since it was set up in January last
year as part of a $40 billion International Monetary Fund rescue
package, IBRA has taken control of almost 50 failed banks, and with
them stakes in roughly 200 companies. This 105 trillion rupiah
portfolio includes Indonesia's largest automaker, its largest tire
maker and its largest shrimp farm. Its real estate holdings make it
one of downtown Jakarta's biggest landlords. Add the 220 trillion
rupiah in bank loans it has inherited, and IBRA controls nearly a
fifth of Indonesia's entire economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They own everything,'' said one American investor in Jakarta
who hopes to buy some of IBRA's holdings. ``There's no use talking
to borrowers anymore. You have one-stop shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   IBRA aims to sell off these assets bit by bit to help the
government offset the tremendous cost of rebuilding the nation's
banks, an essential ingredient to economic growth, but a burden so
large that economists say it could cut into programs for
Indonesia's poor. IBRA hopes to raise 17 trillion rupiah by spring.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of what to sell and when, however, is fraught with
financial and political risks. A reformist agency created by a
deeply unpopular lame-duck government, IBRA has few political
friends. Selling sooner would please foreign investors looking for
bargains, but it would mean going head to head with some of the
nation's most powerful individuals, tycoons with deep connections
to the current government. Selling later would fetch higher prices,
but would risk alienating foreign investors and leave IBRA subject
to the whims of Indonesia's incoming coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the agency has had to please its patrons at the
International Monetary Fund, which is due to sign a new letter of
intent soon releasing an additional $1 billion in loans to
Indonesia, subject to progress on bank restructuring. Yet given its
difficulties, observers say, IBRA is less likely to uproot crony
capitalism than to serve as its inadvertent caretaker until the day
when the cronies can buy their empires back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're running out of time,'' said Andrew Macintyre, an
associate professor of international relations at the University of
California, San Diego. ``It's going to be harder for IBRA to
operate in the new environment than the old environment.''
</P>
<P>
   IBRA's challenges reflect those facing regulators on a smaller
scale across Asia, especially in Thailand and South Korea, as they
battle entrenched old-boy networks to bring accountability and
long-term health to their economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you want to see is court cases against lots of crooks,''
said Hugh Young, managing director of Aberdeen Asset Management,
whose $1.5 billion in funds are invested largely in Asia. ``But
given the cultural impediments in Asia, I don't think you'll see
it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Eko said he is not afraid of such confrontations. Two-thirds of
the 155 trillion rupiah in loans he is trying to recover is owed by
just 200 companies, many of which belong either to Suharto's family
or to his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Eko advised some of the borrowers while working at Chase
Manhattan Bank in the late 1980s. Among his clients was Mohamad
``Bob'' Hasan, a plywood magnate and close friend of Suharto's.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Hasan was just one of some 200 debtors whom Eko
obliged to make an appearance at IBRA's Spartan aerie atop the
headquarters of one of the banks it took over last year. One by
one, they trooped up to the 30th floor to discuss how they would
repay their debt to the country, not only Hasan but even Suharto's
youngest son, Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra.
</P>
<P>
   Eko is well cast for his role as IBRA's steely negotiator. A
former martial arts champion with a rugby player's build, he now
spends his spare time hunting wild game in the jungles of Sumatra
and is as comfortable talking about his favorite .308 caliber rifle
as he is explaining the intricacies of corporate debt
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   After earning an MBA in the United States, where he also went to
college, Eko worked at Chase for eight years, moving from the
bank's credit unit to financing coal mines and gas pipelines. He
left in 1993, and after a year at the American Express Bank, joined
Indonesia's Bank PDFCI.
</P>
<P>
   Eko was charged with cleaning up the development bank's own
bad-loan mess, but his efforts were ultimately for naught. The bank
was borrowing dollars on a short-term basis and handing out
long-term, low-interest-rate rupiah loans. When the rupiah crashed
in 1997, Bank PDFCI found itself in a squeeze, having to pay off
dollar loans with less valuable rupiah.
</P>
<P>
   The final straw came, Eko said, when the company that built the
luxurious Dharmawangsa Hotel and Klub Bimasena defaulted on its
loan to Bank PDFCI. Foreign lenders pulled in their credit lines,
and by August last year Bank PDFCI had become one of the 48 banks
closed by IBRA.
</P>
<P>
   The same month that IBRA took over Bank PDFCI, one of the bank's
commissioners, Glenn Yusuf, resigned to assume the helm at IBRA, a
move that has raised questions because Yusuf is also president of a
government-owned investment bank that is advising IBRA along with
Lehman Brothers and J.P. Morgan. Foreign experts in Indonesia
dismiss the apparent conflict of interest, however, pointing to a
shortage of financial expertise in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few players who can work on the kinds of
transactions that IBRA has to work on,'' said Morgan McGrath,
regional manager for Southeast Asia at Chase Manhattan, who once
employed not only Eko but several other executives now working at
IBRA. ``Their experience will serve them well.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Yusuf who brought Eko aboard at IBRA. Since joining, Eko
has been slowly putting pressure on Indonesia's big debtors. In
June, IBRA published the names of the country's 200 largest
corporate borrowers. Second on the list, with 3.5 trillion rupiah
in loans, is Timor Putra Nasional, the auto company controlled by
Tommy Suharto. No. 5, with 2.9 trillion rupiah in debt, is a
petrochemical company owned by the timber tycoon Prajogo Pangestu
and Suharto's second son, Bambang Trihatmodjo.
</P>
<P>
   IBRA gave the debtors until June 30 to sign a letter committing
them to discuss restructuring with IBRA. All but 26 signed. As for
the others, IBRA's accountants will decide whether they are healthy
enough to restructure. Those that are too ill to survive or prove
uncooperative will face litigation and possible foreclosure by Eko
and his newly appointed bailiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debtor has a choice,'' he said. ``They can play hardball
with me or they can work together with me.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, the government gave IBRA the authority to seize
debtors' assets without going through the courts. Eko said IBRA
also has assurances from the armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, that
the army will back IBRA up. Eko expects trouble. He said he now
travels with four bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Some worry, however, that Eko isn't the one who needs
protection. ``There's no protection for victims,'' said James
Redway, a lawyer representing the Indonesian tire maker Gadjah
Tunggal for the Philadelphia-based law firm Morgan, Lewis &AMP;
Bockius.
</P>
<P>
   Still others say IBRA's special powers may not be so powerful
after all. It is still not clear whether the title to property
seized by IBRA goes with it, something that could worry investors
looking to buy Eko's repossessions.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger source of irritation is the pace of the sales.
Foreign investors trying to get in on the ground floor here
complain that the agency is stalling in the hopes that it won't
have to sell to foreigners. Ernest Bower, president of the
U.S.-ASEAN Business Council, said, speaking of asset sales, ``If
you're going to create wealth and accumulate capital in the
economy, you've got to start, even if initially you're going to
have foreigners picking up some of this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   IBRA says it is in the process of selling assets and plans an
initial public offering of Bank Central Asia by the end of this
year. But it concedes it is stalling: Signs of growth in
Indonesia's economy mean it will be able to earn more for its
assets later. ``We're not in a rush to sell,'' said Christovita
Wiloto, an IBRA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, IBRA appears to have struck what many fear is a
Faustian bargain with former cronies, letting them stay involved in
the management of their indebted companies. Foremost is Bank
Central Asia, which was owned by Suharto's long-time financier and
associate Liem Sioe Liong and his son, Anthony Salim, before it was
nationalized last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bank's loans were to companies in the Salim Group,
but IBRA determined that Bank Central Asia was simply too big to
shut down, because it was the nation's de facto payment system,
with more branches strewn across the archipelago than any other
bank. Rather than tear a gaping hole in the Indonesian economy, the
bank was left intact, with Salim in control as the manager most
capable of delivering returns to the bank's new shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to ask is whether you're destroying value,'' Eko
said of the decision. ``This is what people on the street are too
emotional to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some warn that such compromises may set the stage for the
biggest disappointment of all, a crony comeback. Redway said he
watched a similar drama unfold in Russia. ``When the Soviet Union
collapsed, there was no one who hadn't participated in the old
system,'' he said. The people most capable of running the new
Russia turned out to be the same ones who had run the Soviet Union.
In Indonesia, he predicts, there will be a period of
reconciliation, and then ``everything will be forgotten.''

MALA RUBINSTEIN, EXECUTIVE AND EXPERT ON COSMETICS, DIES AT 93  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Poland)   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mala Rubinstein, a beauty expert and longtime
executive at Helena Rubinstein Inc., as well as an art collector
and patron, died on Thursday at a hospital in Manhattan. She was
93.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rubinstein, a niece of the company's founder, Helena
Rubinstein, lived in Manhattan and Westhampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   She moved from Poland to Paris at age 18 to learn the business
from her aunt and worked at the company from the 1920s until the
1970s, when it was sold. The company is now owned by L'Oreal.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president in charge of creative services, Ms. Rubinstein
was responsible for training beauty consultants in department
stores, an idea originated by Helena Rubinstein Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The author of several books on beauty, she became an evangelist
for her aunt's makeup techniques and traveled extensively with her.
In 1959, they visited Russia to show women there how to apply
makeup. They appeared at the Moscow Exhibition, a trade fair, the
site of a famous impromptu debate between Nikita Khrushchev, the
Soviet premier, and Richard Nixon, then vice president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   A few years earlier, Mala Rubinstein and her staff helped
Japanese women who had been disfigured by the atomic bomb blast in
Hiroshima and were visiting New York for medical treatment learn
how to use skin care products and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Aug. 1,
1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE story &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VENICE-BIENNALE (Venice, Italy) _ To look at new art is to
expect to feel something or be told something or be tweaked or
entertained in ways that have nothing necessarily to do with
tangible objects. Art less and less is judged by the old priorities
of painting, sculpture and drawing. It is context that increasingly
determines the shape of the art we see. Exhibit No. 1: the 48th
Venice Biennale. It's commonly being said about the show that video
art dominates, which is true, but only up to a point. By Michael
Kimmelman. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHEREAU-FILMS (Undated) _ Part enfant terrible and part national
treasure, Patrice Chereau has built a formidable reputation in
France, with three decades of groundbreaking work in theater, opera
and, increasingly, film. His latest movie, ``Those Who Love Me Can
Take the Train,'' had its premiere at the Cannes International Film
Festival last year. By Leslie Camhi. (Moved). Photo. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ILLUMINATA-FILM (New York) _ It's twilight _ the haunting hour
that mingles longing and regret, promise and speculation _ and the
world's youngest method actor is brooding in his Brooklyn bedroom.
``Usually, I (italics)like(end italics) challenging roles,'' says
Amedeo Turturro with the magnificent assurance of an 8-year-old.
``But that role was so challenging, they practically had to force
me to do it.'' The ``they'' he's referring to are his parents, the
actors John Turturro and Katherine Borowitz. The ``it'' is
``Illuminata,'' an engagingly heartfelt new film in which all three
appear. ``Illuminata,'' which opens on Friday, is about a stock
company of 19th- century actors, and the Turturro family has pretty
much become a stock company, too. Husband and wife have performed
together in three plays and three movies, two of which Amedeo
cameoed in. By Franz Lidz. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   STARR-TAPE-THEATER (Undated) _ ``Starr's Last Tape,'' a one-man
play in which a character named Starr, dressed in a prison jump
suit and surrounded by tapes abnd tape recorders, sings hymns,
tunes in to phone taps and dictates his memoirs. The play will have
its world premiere in Stockbridge, Mass., at the Berkshire Theater
Festival's second stage, the Unicorn, from Aug. 24 through 28.
Brian Reddy, who played Stephen Douglas in the 1993 Lincoln Center
Theater revival of ``Abe Lincoln in Illinois,'' will star as
Kenneth N. Starr, directed by Eric Hill. By Sylviane Gold.
(Moved). &QL;

<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARNIVAL-CENTURY-FEST (New York) _ To many New Yorkers, Lincoln
Center Out &UR; - &LR; of &UR; - &LR; Doors has always been there _ a three-week
extravaganza every August that offers a diverse fare of free dance,
music and theater. The forthcoming series, the ``Carnival of the
Century,'' starting Friday, is solidly within that tradition. It
includes the jazz pianist Dave Brubeck, a Greek blues singer, Les
Ballets Trokadero de Monte Carlo, music of the Jewish Diaspora, a
Peruvian dance company and the Colorado String Quartet, plus
entertainment designed just for children. By Valerie Gladstone.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PEONY-PAVILION-MUSIC (New York) _ It's no use either admiring or
picking apart the Lincoln Center Festival '99. Management had
co-designers imposed on it, Shanghai bureaucracy and Lady Luck
among them. The last-minute cancellation of ``The Peony Pavilion''
in 1998 left a hole in the center of the event a year ago. The
resuscitation of this 19-hour Ming Dynasty classic in 1999 was
welcomed by nearly everyone, but it certainly altered any theme
Lincoln Center might originally have had in mind. By Bernard
Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRITTEN-MUSIC (Undated) _ As a composer, Benjamin Britten is not
without detractors among critics and concertgoers. But by any
reasonable measure he is a major figure, a 20th-century master
whose arresting operas, brilliant symphonic works, inventive
chamber music and literate songs hold deserved places in the
repertory. BBC Music has issued five remastered CDs, with more to
come, in a series called ``Britten the Performer.'' Most document
live performances, though a few are taken from studio recordings.
The series includes fascinating performances of Mozart, Tchaikovsky
and Mahler. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PROPAGANDA-PHOTOGS (Washington) _ The word propaganda originally
meant spreading the religious faith; it acquired a generally
pejorative sense only in World War I, when governments took strict
control of war information that could be used in the mass media.
Long before, every medium that could spread ideologies or enhance
renown and power had been called upon to do so. Popes and kings and
dictators commissioned architecture, sculpture and painting,
enlisted playwrights and speakers, and hired designers to shape the
ruler's image and fashion the servants' livery as well as the
military's uniforms. When photography came along, it, too, was soon
pressed into service. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MODERN-BOOKS-COLLECTING (Undated) _ Since the early '90s, prices
for first editions of modern literary works have hit the
stratosphere: $35,000 for a signed copy of Jack Kerouac's ``On the
Road''; $250,000 for a copy of ``Ulysses'' signed by James Joyce to
Ezra Pound, and $15,000 for Harper Lee's ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
The gold rush in such literary ``high points'' _ the industry term
for well known titles by name authors _ has also fostered
speculation in recently published books _ first editions printed
within the last five years that are still in pristine condition and
preferably signed by the author. By Christa Worthington. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-ONCE-AGAIN (Undated) _ A look at ABC's forthcoming drama
series ``Once and Again,'' which will be introduced for seven
weeks, starting Tuesday, Sept. 21, at 10 p.m. By Bernard Weinraub.

FEDERAL AGENCY APPROVES ANTI-FLU DRUG, OVERRIDING RECOMMENDATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday
approved a new inhaled drug to treat influenza, overriding a panel
of independent scientific advisers who five months ago recommended
the drug be kept off pharmacy shelves because it is only marginally
effective and may be dangerous for asthma patients.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, Relenza by Glaxo Wellcome, brings to three the number
of antiviral medications now available to treat the flu. Relenza is
the first flu medicine approved to treat both type A and type B
strains of influenza, as opposed to type A only, and it is the
first in a new class of drugs that block the spread of flu germs
throughout the body by inhibiting an enzyme called neuraminidase.
</P>
<P>
   In giving Relenza its imprimatur, the Food and Drug
Administration took a rare step; the agency almost always follows
the advice of its scientific experts. But with so few flu medicines
on the market, Dr. Heidi Jolson, the agency's official in charge of
reviewing Relenza, said the drug merited approval despite the
``very legitimate'' concerns that prompted the panel to reject it
by a 13-to-4 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Influenza is a major public health problem,'' Dr. Jolson said.
``There are deaths each year. We think it is a public health
priority to make new medications available if they are found to be
safe and effective.'' She added: ``We feel that this drug has been
found to be effective, but to a modest degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Relenza has been approved for adults and adolescents
ages 12 and older, the drug's label states it has not been proven
effective, and may pose a risk for patients with severe asthma or
other breathing disorders. In clinical studies, some asthma
patients experienced ``bronchospasm,'' a shutting down of the
airways, after taking the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the drug been proven effective for preventing the flu.
Officials at Glaxo Wellcome said on Tuesday that they expected the
medicine to be available sometime next fall, but have not yet set a
price.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, about 30 million Americans suffer the flu. Most
recover after a week of fever, aches and pains, but the disease
kills an estimated 20,000 people annually in this country, most of
them elderly. Although infectious disease experts say the flu
vaccine is still the best safeguard against influenza, many had
high hopes for Relenza, which has already been approved in
Australia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of the medication has been the subject of
intense debate. In foreign studies, Relenza, which goes by the
generic name zanamivir, alleviated the fever and pain associated
with flu roughly two to two and a half days sooner than a dummy
medication. But the drug did not work as well among patients in the
United States; in a study of 777 North Americans, most of them in
this country, Glaxo Wellcome reported that Relenza cut the
seven-day course of the flu by just one day.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jolson attributed the difference to the Americans' use of
over-the-counter cold remedies, which made patients feel better and
confounded the scientists trying to analyze Relenza's effect. Yet
there was division about the findings even within the Food and Drug
Administration; when an agency biostatistician analyzed Glaxo
Wellcome's results, he found that the effect among North American
patients was even more marginal than the company reported, and
concluded Relenza was no better than a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jolson said the agency's medical reviewers did not agree
with the statistician, but the scientific panel found his evidence
persuasive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Leslie Hendeles, a professor of pharmacy at the University
of Florida who served on the committee, explained his reasoning on
Tuesday. ``To me,'' he said, ``if you are sick for seven days and
you take a medicine and you are sick for six days, then you are
still sick for six days.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Michael Elliott, who directs influenza research at Glaxo
Wellcome, said the benefits of the drug should not be discounted.
``A day or a day and a half may not sound very great,'' Elliott
said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ``But to a patient
suffering the flu, the fever and pain and body aches, if you could
reduce that by a day and a half, that is very important. Think of
parents at home, or self-employed people.''

COMMENTARY: EYES WIDE OPEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Everyone has been calling, wanting all the gruesome
details.
</P>
<P>
   They ask how it feels when the little lawn-mower device slices
off your corneas and the red laser beams sear your eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   They want to know the price of vanity. Is it worth the risk and
the pain? It occurs to me that we'll never have Omaha Beach, but
thank heaven my generation can exhibit bravery under laser fire.
</P>
<P>
   I tell them that reclaiming 20-20 in five minutes with a laser
feels like one of those old Roger Corman horror movies. First,
you've got to be alarmed by any technology that was developed in
Russia. Second, anyone weaned on Rod Serling is bound to stew about
eerie side effects.
</P>
<P>
   On the operating table in a suburban mall, my eyes propped open
with some scary little eye-propping-open metal things, I felt like
Ray Milland in ``X: The Man With the X-Ray Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it was fun for Ray, a scientist named Dr. James Xavier,
when he first drips in his eyes the serum he has invented to extend
the limits of sight. ``My dear friend,'' his partner, Sam, tells
him, ``only the gods see everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dear doctor,'' Ray replies, ``I'm closing in on the gods.''
</P>
<P>
   He happily peers through walls and women's dresses. But then he
starts seeing too much _ veins and organs and rushing blood. He
ends up working for Don Rickles in a carnival freak show before
plucking out his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Moral: Leave nature alone.
</P>
<P>
   I told my friends I could see great now, although I knew I would
miss the blurriness at certain moments _ on bad dates, at Iowa
straw polls, frowning in the mirror at the gym.
</P>
<P>
   But they ignored me. They know I always look on the dark side.
If only there were a laser that corrected fatalistic Irish vision.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, boomers are addicts of appearances, the whitening and
tightening, the peeling and priapic products. We are a generation
of Dr. Frankensteins and our monster is us. We don't mind perishing
by the image as long as we get to live by the image.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, we want to see clearly while looking for creative new
ways to indulge the self. There are, after all, so few reliable
ways to turn back the clock.
</P>
<P>
   For the most self-regarding generation in history, the hands on
the clock are swinging wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Our first boomer president is about to retire to the New York
dinner-party circuit. The Age of Aquarius has become the Age of
Collagen.
</P>
<P>
   This month's Vogue has a heart-warming, first-person account of
a daughter who is ``finally able to give something back,'' by
arranging her mother's face lift.
</P>
<P>
   Catalogs clog the mailbox, filled with snake-oil promises,
mysterious chemicals and odd devices. The Self-Care catalog offers
Brain Gum to improve ``cognitive functions by restoring a healthy
level of phosphatidylserine in the brain''; the ``Lip Enhancer,''
which ``through a gentle vacuum process ... keeps lips full and
plump up to 12 hours between uses''; Infusia lotion to diminish the
appearance of spider veins, and something that looks as if it had
been invented by the wacky secretary Elaine on ``Ally McBeal'' _
the magnetic face mask, said to increase blood flow to tone facial
muscles. Sagging skin will be gone anon, the blurb vows: ``The
mask's 19 gold-plated magnets have a powerful 1,500-gauss surface,
and are strategically located at your facial acupressure points.''
</P>
<P>
   (In a related development, an Allure magazine ``news bulletin''
announces: ``Bio-mecanica's battery-powered suction bra builds a
bigger breast.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post recently ran a front-page article on the
remarkable boom in sales for products featuring the words
``anti-aging'' or ``age-defying.'' In the last six years, it says,
sales of ``age-repair'' potions filled with weird ingredients like
tanbark oak and chardonnay grape-seed extract have grown from $325
million to $3.6 billion, and at last count there were 1,700
different anti-wrinkle creams vowing to release the luminescence
trapped under those icky old dead skin cells.
</P>
<P>
   It's a losing battle, of course.
</P>
<P>
   We can play with our lasers and magnets and suction and magic
elixirs all we want. We can get phosphatidylserine and
phyto-nutrients pumping. We can Viagrandize to the max. But gravity
and french fries will eventually have their way.

STATE OFFICIALS DIVIDED OVER USE OF GASOLINE ADDITIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., Neb.) (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ State environmental officials were divided on
Tuesday over whether Congress should act to reduce the use of MTBE,
a chemical used in gasoline that helps keep the air clean but
sometimes pollutes water.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies were also beginning to figure out how to comply
with the possible change in the rules, while producers of ethanol,
a competing chemical, began work to cash in.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, one of the most aggressive states in fighting
air pollution, Nancy L. Seidman, deputy director of the Department
of Environmental Protection, said she worried about what oil
companies would use in place of MTBE. Ms. Seidman said the state
had lost the use of some wells from contamination by MTBE, which,
when leaked, dissolves in water, but ``we're not convinced there
are significant water-supply issues here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials responsible for air quality said that the public
seemed to be more concerned with water pollution from MTBE, which
scientists say may be carcinogenic, than air pollution from
components of gasoline that are proven to cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what you can see and taste versus what you can't,'' said
Jane K. Stahl, the deputy commissioner of the Connecticut
Department of Environmental Protection, in Hartford. ``What made
MTBE come to the forefront is that you could smell it in your
water, and taste it. It smells like you're drinking gasoline, and
that's very scary and very offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Stahl and officials in other states said MTBE was
generally not a public health hazard. She said, though, that they
favored gradual reductions in MTBE use to reduce the risk to water.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed a law in 1990 that resulted in heavy MTBE use in
California and on the East Coast in an effort to cut carbon
monoxide and smog. But clean air experts say its main benefit has
been a reduction in more toxic cancer-causing chemicals in
gasoline, like benzene and toluene. When spilled, though, MTBE
moves through the soil faster than those natural hydrocarbons and
has made some wells useless because it makes the water reek.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of experts appointed by the Environmental Protection
Agency formally reported Tuesday on MTBE, and said its use should
be reduced substantially. Carol M. Browner, the agency's
administrator, said even before the report was released that she
would work with Congress to modify the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 require that areas with air
pollution problems use reformulated gasoline that includes an
``oxygenate,'' a molecule that incorporates an oxygen atom. MTBE is
used in 85 percent of reformulated gasoline, while ethanol, which
is made from corn, accounts for almost all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol producers were planning legislative strategy to maintain
their market, which exists mostly because of the oxygenate
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Todd C. Sneller, the administrator of the Nebraska Ethanol
Board, a state agency, said that ``it would be difficult to advance
a proposal to eliminate the oxygen standard without some
ethanol-related provision,'' and that Congress still liked
ethanol's ability to reduce oil imports and greenhouse gas
emissions. ``The agriculture lobby and the ethanol lobby can have
some influence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sneller said that in the next 10 days supporters in Congress
would introduce legislation requiring that some fraction of
gasoline come from ``renewable'' sources like ethanol, just as some
states, in restructuring their electric utilities, were requiring
that each company have some electricity from renewable sources,
like solar or wind power.
</P>
<P>
   The big oil companies started making MTBE in the early 1980s as
a substitute for lead, which the government had ordered be phased
out of gasoline. Both lead and MTBE raise octane, which is a
measure of gasoline's ability to withstand premature detonation in
an engine.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, MTBE and ethanol are used in places where no
oxygenate is required. So even if the oxygenate requirement is
dropped, it will continue to be used, although at lower levels, oil
executives say.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of oxygenates said that incorporating an oxygen atom
into the fuel makes the mixture in a car's cylinders leaner, and
thus cuts pollution. But in the years since the mandate, cars have
been built with sensors that continuously sense the richness of the
mixture, and adjust the fuel-air mixture accordingly, leading some
experts to say that oxygenates are no longer so useful for
controlling carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies, though, have always maintained that Congress'
reason was political, to help corn growers, and reduce reliance on
imported fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Robert H. Campbell, the chairman and chief executive of Sunoco,
said that if the oxygenate requirement were lifted, his company
would probably reduce its use by 70 to 80 percent, but that
something else would have to take MTBE's place, and ``they're not
going to let us use benzene or other compounds they consider very
toxic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's going to have to invest in producing other barrels
to fill that gap,'' he said, because customers would want the same
number of gallons. A likely candidate to make up the volume, he
said, is alkylates, a class of chemicals produced in refineries by
taking smaller molecules and combining them; the smaller molecules
can cause pollution because they are prone to evaporate before they
are burned, and form the raw materials for smog.

 &HT;    Heisman watch: Launching Carter's campaign
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Quincy Carter sat at a table at the front of
the main auditorium in the Sheraton Civic Center, surrounded so
completely by sportswriters and microphones and tape recorders that
he could hardly turn his head. He fielded all manner of questions,
some of them inane, others pointed. He'd barely get the answer out
for one, then it would be followed by another.
</P>
<P>
   As Carter was ushered to a van that would take him, coach Jim
Donnan and teammate Orantes Grant to their waiting plane, he was
followed through the atrium, down the escalator and out the doors
of the hotel by a column of query-tossing reporters.
</P>
<P>
   It's official. Quincy Carter's Heisman Trophy campaign has
begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just taking it all in stride,'' Georgia's sophomore
quarterback said when asked if he was prepared for the media
onslaught. ``My teammates know what kind of guy I am. We don't talk
about it at school. I try to downplay it so everybody else does.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tuesday's events during the first day of the SEC Football
Kickoff are any indication, Carter's going to find it difficult to
hide from the limelight this year. And unless Georgia's largely
unproven cast around Carter can provide him some protection,
Carter's going to find it equally as difficult to evade opposing
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   That, in a nutshell, was Carter's message here on Tuesday. He
can win neither cames nor the Heisman by himself, nor does he plan
to try to.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win the Heisman Trophy, you've got to win games and, to do
that, you have to have some good people around you,'' Carter said.
``I think we've got that. It feels good to be a Heisman candidate
but you can't do it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other individuals will have to step to the forefront for
that to happen. The Bulldogs lost their two starting tackles to the
first- and second-round of the NFL draft, their top four receivers,
both tight ends and their leading rusher off the 1998 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Quincy's really crossed the bridge in terms of his
development and this is a big year for him,'' Georgia coach Jim
Donnan said. ``I just hope he can get some help, more than
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's Heisman Trophy candidacy was endorsed by at least one
other coach attending Tuesday's meetings, LSU's Gerry DiNardo.
</P>
<P>
   It was DiNardo's Tigers who saw Carter at his very best last
season. The beleaguered LSU stood awed on the Tiger Stadium
sideline last as he watched Carter torched his team for 318 yards
passing, 41 yards rushing and two touchdowns en route to a 28-27
upset victory before a sold-out crowd and a national television
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it, it's legitimate,'' DiNardo said of Carter's
Heisman campaign. ``He's that good.''
</P>
<P>
   While DiNardo lauded Carter's passing and scrambling ability,
it's another trait he said that sets the Georgia quarterback apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was scrambling around on our sideline and our guys hit him
hard, so hard one time that his mouthpiece came flying out of his
helmet,'' DiNardo said. ``But he just reached out, picked up that
mouthpiece, popped it back in his mouth and ran back to the huddle.
Now that's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since Herschel Walker drew Heisman consideration as a
freshman and mounted a full-fledged campaign the next year has a
Georgia sophomore experienced such a concentrated push for college
football's top award so early. But after starting all 12 games and
breaking all of Eric Zeier's freshmen passing records for attempts
(290), completions (176), yards (2,484) and touchdowns (13), Donnan
and the UGA publicity machine felt there was no reason to put off
Carter's candidacy. He's featured on the `99 media guide's cover,
with ``Heisman Trophy candidate'' printed in white type across his
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like for our players to get individual awards,'' Donnan
said. ``I don't think it's more pressure on him, per se. He's got
enough pressure just playing quarterback at Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   The general feeling is last season was just the tip of the
iceberg for Carter. He was unable to practice or study Donnan's
offensive system until a month before the first game of last
season. This year, he's been intensely schooled and even left
professional baseball a month early this summer to join volunteer
workouts with his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was doing pretty good last year But I realize now
I know I lot more now than I did then,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   With a high-profile publicity campaign also comes scrutiny, and
Carter was asked about his partnership with agent Eugene Parker and
the chances of his turning professional at the end of the season.
He deftly dodged each query, insisting he wasn't thinking about the
pros and limiting his focus to the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, however, didn't mince words on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't need to go pro,'' said the fourth-year Georgia
coach. ``At the end of the season, we'll get together and talk
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly:
</P>
<P>
   At least three pieces of Georgia news were revealed during
Tuesday's media conference: Freshmen wide receiver Durell Robinson
will indeed come in as a partial qualifier, senior Adrian
Hollingshed will be moved back to linebacker from defensive end and
former tight end Ian Knight has been moved to back-up center behind
senior Miles Luckie.

 &HT;    Democrats mourn friend, lobbyist
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dan Dutko, a Washington lobbyist and political
powerhouse with deep ties to Texas Democrats, died Tuesday in
Colorado, two days after a bicycling accident during a ride with
former state Land Commissioner Garry Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   Dutko, a prodigious fund-raiser for Democrats, was co-chairman
of the Democratic National Committee's fund-raising drive for the
2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, who has endured personal and political hardship in recent
years with a stiff upper lip, called Dutko's death ``the worst
thing that ever happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan was one of my lifelong friends. Seeing something like this
happen is . . .,'' Mauro said, unable to find the words.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Tuesday praised Dutko, 54, a Democratic
National Committee member, as a longtime friend, ally and adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``He enriched our lives with his enthusiasm and served his
country with distinction,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro and Dutko were in Aspen for a Saturday fund-raising event
featuring Clinton. The three men met in 1972 while working in Texas
for George McGovern's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Dutko, Mauro and Austinite Kelly Vidovic were riding together
Sunday among a group of riders heading down Maroon Creek Road in
Aspen. Mauro said all went well until the weather changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started raining, and we were going down a hill, and he lost
control of the bike and went over the handlebars,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   Dutko was not wearing a helmet. Mauro did not initially think
the fall was serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected him to jump up and be upset because we were going
to have to go to the emergency room and get some stitches,'' said
Mauro, adding that he knew it was far more serious once he got to
Dutko.
</P>
<P>
   Dutko was taken to Aspen Valley Hospital and later transferred
to St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction, where he died Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado State Patrol said the accident was caused by
``rider inexperience.'' Dutko ``possibly'' activated the front
brake of the mountain bike, a maneuver than can jettison a rider
over the handlebars, according to the state patrol.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Streator, Ill., Dutko served in the Air Force from
1962 to '66. He worked as a missile systems test engineer for
Eureka Williams in Illinois and later for San Angelo Communications
and Electronics in West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He began his political career in 1972 as West Texas coordinator
for McGovern and later worked for Bob Bullock, then the state
comptroller, in the agency's San Angelo office.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to Washington, Dutko was chief of staff for
then-U.S. Rep. Bob Krueger of Texas and then-Sen. Donald Stewart of
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, he formed The Dutko Group, a Washington lobbying firm
that now bills itself as ``bipartisan and multidisciplinary'' with
partners who are ``personally connected, at the highest levels, to
the Republican and Democratic parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm's client list includes Longhorn Partners Pipeline Co.,
which wants to pump gasoline to El Paso through a dormant crude oil
pipeline that runs through South Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Dutko was vice chairman for finance in the 1996 presidential
campaign and finance chairman for Clinton's 1997 inauguration. This
year, he was raising money for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, longtime political operative Bob Mann said he shared
a small apartment on South Congress Avenue with Dutko and others
when they worked on Krueger's unsuccessful 1978 senatorial race
against Republican John Tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan was an old liberal who had matured and probably still had
those instincts but learned, as many of us do as we get older, to
compromise and see the two sides to every story,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Dutko is survived by his wife, Deborah Jospin, director of
AmeriCorps, and sons Jonathan, 6, and Matthew, 5.
</P>
<P>
   A private funeral and burial are scheduled for Thursday in
Savannah, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service is scheduled for Monday at 1 p.m. at Temple
Sinai in Washington.

</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Corrects spelling of Cary in 2nd graf and substitutes 15th
graf, In an interview ..., to give more detailed background
information.)  (lh) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ He said he had dreamed of killing women for 30
years before he found his moment this February, when a middle-aged
woman and two teen-agers on a sightseeing trip to Yosemite National
Park happened to take a room at the motel where he worked as a
janitor.
</P>
<P>
   He killed all three women, Cary Stayner told a television
reporter on Monday night. Then he laid low, escaping suspicion of
the FBI when he was interviewed later in February by its agents,
who then focused on a group of ex-convicts as suspects.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, he said, he could no longer resist the temptation
to kill again, and he decapitated a 26-year-old Yosemite
naturalist, Joie Ruth Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   In a 25-minute jailhouse interview in Sacramento only hours
after he was charged in federal court there with the murder of Ms.
Armstrong, Stayner told the reporter, Ted Rowlands of KBWB-TV in
San Francisco, that he had fantasized since childhood about
murdering women and had killed these four ``because they were at
the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview was conducted off-camera and reported Monday on
the late news. In it, Rowlands reported that Stayner said he
planned to plead guilty to the Armstrong killing when he is
arraigned in Fresno on Aug. 6 and that he also wanted to plead
guilty to the other killings, with which he has not yet been
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands said Stayner, a 37-year-old janitor at the Cedar Lodge
in El Portal, on Yosemite's western edge, had given a detailed
account of how he had killed Carole Sund, 42, her daughter Juli
Sund, 15, and their friend Silvina Pelosso, 16. Their disappearance
from the Cedar Lodge on Feb. 15 generated a vast investigation and
national headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner, whose only prior arrest was for marijuana possession,
told Rowlands that he had tricked the three women into letting him
into their room and had then held them at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had strangled Carole Sund and Ms. Pelosso there, put
their bodies into the trunk of their rental car and then made Juli
Sund drive with him as he searched for a place to kill her and dump
the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, he said, he killed Juli Sund, by slashing her
throat so fiercely that he nearly severed her head, and dumped her
body near a creek. He then left the rental car, with two bodies
still in the trunk, at the remote community of Long Barn, a
two-and-a-half-hour drive east of El Portal, and took a taxi and a
bus back home.
</P>
<P>
   He did not sexually abuse any of his victims, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, he said, he returned _ not only to burn the car
but also to retrieve Mrs. Sund's wallet, which he used to throw the
FBI off his track by dumping it off a highway in Modesto, about
midway between El Portal and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic worked. When Mrs. Sund's wallet was found in Modesto,
both the FBI and local law-enforcement officials set up command
centers at a local hotel and began focusing on suspects in the
Modesto area. Several men with long criminal records have been held
in connection with the case for months, and a federal grand jury
has been hearing testimony since April from associates of those in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, when it announced that Stayner had been arrested
in the decapitation of Ms. Armstrong and was now ``the prime
suspect'' in the February slayings, the FBI had maintained that all
the people involved in those earlier killings were in custody,
albeit on unrelated charges.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the television interview, two previously reported
FBI affidavits say that Stayner has confessed in detail to all four
killings, describing facts about the crimes that only someone
involved could have known.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Stayner also told of involvement of a
different kind. At the time Juli Sund's body was found, six days
after the discovery of the two other victims, the authorities said
only that they had been led to the body by a tip. Stayner said on
Monday night that the tip had come from him, in a letter he had
written the FBI telling agents where to look for the body. He had
someone else, unaware of his spree of killing, lick the envelope
for him so that his DNA could not be traced, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, an FBI spokesman, Nick Rossi, declined to comment on
the affidavits and refused to confirm or deny any statements
Stayner ``may have made.''
</P>
<P>
   Stayner's arrest, and confession, has brought new scrutiny to
the investigation of the case. James M. Maddock, who is in charge
of the FBI's Sacramento office, said that the agency will be
examining what, if anything, might have been done differently.
</P>
<P>
   In his confessions, both as described in the affidavits and by
the television station, Stayner said he took pains to throw
officials off by wetting towels in the women's room in the Cedar
Lodge to make it seem as if they had been there the day after he
had killed them.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner's family, was the victim of a terrible crime when he was
11. Stayner's younger brother, Steven, was kidnapped in their
hometown of Merced, and was held for seven years by a sexual
molester. When his abductor showed up one day with a new victim,
Steven and the younger boy escaped. Eight years later, in 1989, at
age 24, Steven was killed in a motorcycle crash.
</P>
<P>
   Reports by local news organizations have been filled with
speculation that Steven's ordeal may somehow have led his brother
to perpetrate violence against women. But in the interview, Stayner
said that he had fantasized about killing women since he was 7,
years before his brother was kidnapped.

   On Tuesday, Stayner's father, Delbert Stayner, said that he
still could not believe that his son had committed the murders.
``Maybe someone threatened him into confessing,'' he said in a

HOSTILITIES CONTINUE BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND AOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hostilities continued Tuesday in the bitter debate over whether
Microsoft should be able to link into America Online's popular
instant message system, with Microsoft rebuffing America Online's
invitation to discuss a possible deal.
</P>
<P>
   The war broke out last week when Microsoft Corp. introduced new
software that allows users to send instant messages both to users
of Microsoft's Hotmail service and to users of the America Online
service and others who use the AOL Instant Messenger, or AIM,
software. America Online said Microsoft was acting like a hacker,
connecting to its system without authorization.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent days, Microsoft has issued several new versions of
its software as America Online has cut off each preceding version.
On Friday, America Online sent a letter to Microsoft, demanding
that Microsoft stop using its system but inviting the company to
negotiate some sort of message exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response Tuesday, Brad Chase, a vice president of
Microsoft, asserted that Microsoft had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been and is no unauthorized use or access of AOL's
services or products,'' Chase wrote. ``Nor has Microsoft violated
the privacy or security of any AIM users.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter had no direct response to America Online's invitation
to discuss an accord. Rather, Chase simply called on America Online
to stop its efforts to block Microsoft's software.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's reaction was quick and stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear from reading their letter that America Online and
Microsoft still have significant disagreements on privacy and
security,'' said Kenneth Lerer, a principal with Robinson Lerer,
America Online's public relations firm. As for Microsoft's reaction
to America Online's invitation, Lerer said ``their silence speaks
for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Bennet, a product manager in Microsoft's consumer and
commerce business, said that America Online was not in fact
amenable to discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their letter was not a negotiation but a club,'' Bennet said.
He said that Microsoft wanted to work for an open standard through
an industry consortium rather than to negotiate a bilateral deal
with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Lerer of America Online said that the company believes that
instant messaging will ultimately be open so that users of any
instant message software will be able to communicate with users of
any other such program. Currently each system is in effect a closed
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Internet industry executives, however, said they saw no
indication that America Online is moving to open its base of 40
million instant message users to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, America Online cut off instant messaging systems from
Prodigy and Yahoo that also had found a way to link to the America
Online system. Prodigy and Yahoo officials say that America Online
has made no efforts to indicate the terms on which it would allow
access.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, America Online has not been active in the industry
task force that has been trying to write open standards for instant
messages, said Vijay Saraswat, a researcher for AT&AMP;T Labs and the
co-chair of the task force. Microsoft has been active in the task
force and has proposed a standard. But Saraswat said that Microsoft
has yet to show a commitment to those standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``America Online is not alone,'' he said. ``Microsoft is not
following a public protocol, even though they had proposed one.''

 &HT;    Despite sales slump, officials optimistic about lottery's future
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Lottery officials said Tuesday they may be
able to see the light at the end of the sales slump, an optimistic
view for an operation fresh from its second-worst week in its worst
year since start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Lottery Director Linda Cloud said a multistate,
mega-jackpot game planned for later this year will be postponed
until the middle of next year or later.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism about ticket sales, which headed south and stayed
there in 1997 when lawmakers cut the payout on scratch-off games,
is based on numbers showing slight increases in scratch-off sales
in the weeks since lawmakers restored the prizes to previous
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the good news is that we have begun an upward move in
sales in the past few weeks,'' Toni Smith, the agency's marketing
director, told the Texas Lottery Commission. ``We are very excited
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Scratch-off tickets have been the major cause of the prolonged
slump. Sales for those games hit $28.2 million, the highest weekly
total since February, in the week ending July 10. Sales have
slipped a bit in recent weeks but continue to indicate the lottery
may have hit bottom and could be heading back up.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, ticket sales for all games, including Lotto and other
online games, dipped to $43.8 million. The only worse week this
fiscal year ended June 12, when sales totaled $41.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's low numbers came after a week that, fueled by a $37
million Lotto jackpot, produced $60.7 million in sales _ the best
week since last October.
</P>
<P>
   Overall sales for the current fiscal year total $2.3 billion,
down 17 percent from the same period for the previous year. This
year's weekly sales average is $49.6 million, down from $60 million
for the same period in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1992 start-up, the lottery has sold $20.8 billion
worth of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism at the Lottery Commission increases proportionately to
the number of new scratch-off games that hit the street. Texas
lawmakers, looking to reverse the sales slump that set in when they
lowered prize payouts in September 1997, voted this year to raise
them.
</P>
<P>
   The prize pool for scratch-off games now will be calculated on
an annual average of 57 percent, up from the 52 percent set in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Eight new games, four with prize pools of 60 percent and four
with prize pools of 65 percent, have hit the stores since June 16.
Cloud, the lottery director, said players notice the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hearing from the retailers that they don't want our old
games anymore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the optimism, Cloud said the lottery will not hit
unofficial goals she had set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped . . . that we would see a significant turnaround
by Sept. 1,'' said Cloud, adding that she wanted weekly sales to
get back to about $64 million. ``I'm not sure we are going to see
that that quick. It may be the first of the year before we get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud said the lottery lost many ``core players'' while the
payout on scratch-off tickets was lowered.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials also were looking for a major sales boost by
signing Texas up for a multistate game for the first time. Texas
does not participate in Powerball and other multistate games that
produce jackpots over $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The first such effort had been scheduled to start Oct. 22 with a
10-state alliance involved in ``Game of the Century,'' which,
officials said, could have carried a jackpot topping $200 million.
Ticket sales for the game, timed to capitalize on millennium
madness, were to end Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   But Cloud said Tuesday that only four states _ Texas, Georgia,
Illinois and Virginia _ had made all the changes and preparations
needed to get the game going this year. Some of the other states
still need legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are looking at maybe July or the end of next year,''
she said.

GOVERNMENT PROPOSES TO MONITOR BANKING AND OTHER COMPUTER
NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ADDS new grafs 12, 13 bgng, The plan focuses ..., to suggest types
of data that could be monitored: moves up penultimate graf in orig
text to become graf 14.) (Exclusive) 
(js) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has developed a plan for an extensive
computer monitoring system, overseen by the FBI, to protect the
nation's crucial data networks from intruders.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, an outgrowth of the administration's anti-terrorism
program, has already raised concerns from civil liberties groups.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the plan, prepared by officials at the National
Security Council last month and provided to The New York Times by a
civil liberties group, calls for a sophisticated software system to
monitor activities on non-military government networks and a
separate system to track networks used in the banking,
telecommunications and transportation industries.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, whose details are still being debated within the
administration, is intended to alert law enforcement officials to
attacks that might cripple governmental operations or the nation's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the increasing power of the nation's computers
and their emerging role as a backbone of the nation's commerce,
politics and culture, critics of the proposed system say it could
become a building block for a surveillance infrastructure with
great potential for misuse.
</P>
<P>
   They also argue that such a network of monitoring programs could
itself be open to security breaches, giving intruders or
unauthorized users a vast window into government and corporate
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department began deploying such a system three years
ago. But Government officials said that the changing nature of
military threats in the information age had altered the nature of
national security concerns and created a new sense of urgency to
protect the nation's information infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern about organized cyber attack has escalated
dramatically,'' Jeffrey Hunker, the National Security Council's
director of information protection, who is overseeing the plan,
said Tuesday. ``We do know of a number of hostile foreign
governments that are developing sophisticated and well organized
offensive cyber attack capabilities and we have good reason to
believe that terrorists may be developing similar capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plan, networks of thousands of software
monitoring programs would constantly track computer activities,
looking for indications of computer network intrusions and other
illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the creation of a Federal Intrusion Detection
Network, or Fidnet, and specifies that the data it collects will be
gathered in a centralized data center at the National
Infrastructure Protection Center, an interagency task force housed
at the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system, to be put fully in place by 2003, is meant to
permit government security experts to track ``patterns of
patterns'' of information and respond in a coordinated manner
against intruders and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The plan focuses on monitoring data flowing over government and
national computer networks. That means the systems would
potentially have access to computer-to- computer communications
like electronic mail and other documents, computer programs and
remote log-ins.
</P>
<P>
   But an increasing percentage of network traffic, like banking
and financial information, is routinely encrypted and would not be
visible to the monitor software. Government officials argue that
they are not interested in eavesdropping, but rather are looking
for patterns of behavior that suggest illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, the Pentagon has begun to string
together entire network surveillance systems by instrumenting them
with filters that report data to a central site, much as a burglar
alarm might be reported at the local police station.
</P>
<P>
   For example, officials said that such a system might have
protected against intrusions recently reported in computers at the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces information like the
consumer price index that can affect the performance of the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   The draft report, which has been circulated widely within the
executive branch, has generated concern among some officials over
its privacy implications. Several officials involved in the debate
over the plan said that the situation was ``fluid'' and that many
aspects were still not final.
</P>
<P>
   The report is vague on several crucial points, including the
kinds of data to be collected and the specific federal and
corporate computer networks to be monitored. The report also lacks
details about the ways information collected in non-governmental
agencies would be maintained and under what conditions it would be
made available to law enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that the National Security Council was
conducting a legal and technical review of the plan and that a
final report is scheduled to be released in September, subject to
President Clinton's approval.

 UNDATED: Clinton's approval.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The plan was created in response to a presidential directive in
May 1998 requiring the executive branch to review the
vulnerabilities of the federal government's computer systems in
order to become a ``model of information and security.''
</P>
<P>
   In a cover letter to the draft plan Clinton writes, ``A
concerted attack on the computers of any one of our key economic
sectors or governmental agencies could have catastrophic effects.''
</P>
<P>
   But the plan strikes at the heart of a growing controversy over
how to protect the nation's computer systems while also protecting
civil liberties _ particularly since it would put a new and
powerful tool into the hands of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, data flowing over the Internet is becoming a vital
tool for law enforcement, and civil liberties experts said law
enforcement agencies would be under great temptation to expand the
use of the information in pursuit of suspected criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report clearly recognizes the civil liberties
implications,'' said James X. Dempsey, staff counsel for the Center
for Democracy and Technology, a Washington civil liberties group,
``But it brushes them away.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft plan states: ``As access to relevant networks is
premised on `consent' of the user to allow session monitoring, the
collection of certain data identified as anomalous activity or a
suspicious event would not be considered a privacy issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey conceded the legal validity of the point, but said there
was tremendous potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern is that Fidnet is an ill-defined monitoring
system of potentially broad sweep,'' he said. ``It seems to place
monitoring and surveillance at the center of the government's
response to a problem that is not well suited to such measures.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is making a concerted effort to insure
that civil liberties and privacy rights are not violated by the
plan, Hunker said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that data gathered from non-government computer networks
will be collected separately from the FBI-controlled monitoring
system at a separate location within a General Services
Administration building. He said that was done to keep
non-government data at arm's length from law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also has drawn concern from civil libertarians because
it blends civilian and military functions in protecting the
nation's computer networks. The report notes that there is already
a Department of Defense ``contingent'' working at the FBI's
infrastructure protection center to integrate intelligence,
counterintelligence and law enforcement efforts in protecting
Pentagon computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight over this could make the fight over encryption look
like nothing,'' said Mary Culnan, an professor at Georgetown
University who served on a presidential commission whose work led
to the May 1998 directive on infrastructure protection. ``The
conceptual problem is that there are people running this program
who don't understand how citizens feel about privacy in
cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has been discussing the proposal widely with a
number of industry security committees and associations in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry executives said there is still reluctance on
the part of industry to directly share information on computer
intrusions with law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to control the decision-making process,'' said Mark
Rasch, vice president and general counsel of Global Integrity, a
company in Reston, Va., that coordinates computer security for the
financial services industries.
</P>
<P>
   One potential problem in carrying out the government's plan is
that intrusion-detection software technology is still immature,
industry executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercial intrusion detection systems are not ready for
prime time,'' said Peter Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI
International in Menlo Park, Calif., and a pioneer in the field of
intrusion detection systems.
</P>
<P>
   Current systems tend to generate false alarms and thus require
many skilled operators.
</P>
<P>
   But a significant portion of the $1.4 billion the Clinton
administration has requested for computer security for fiscal year
2000 is intended to be spent on research, and government officials
said they were hopeful that the planned effort would be able to
rely on automated detection technologies and on artificial
intelligence capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   For several years computer security specialists have used
software variously known as packet filters or ``sniffers'' as
monitoring devices to track computer intruders. Like telephone
wiretaps, such tools can be used to reconstruct the activities of a
computer user as if a videotape were made of his computer display.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the software tools are routinely
misused by illicit computer network users to steal information such
as passwords or other data.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, commercial vendors are beginning to sell monitoring
tools that combine packet filtering with more sophisticated and
automated intrusion detection software that tries to detect abuse
by looking for behavior patterns or certain sequences of commands.

 UNDATED: Clinton's approval.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The plan was created in response to a presidential directive in
May 1998 requiring the executive branch to review the
vulnerabilities of the federal government's computer systems in
order to become a ``model of information and security.''
</P>
<P>
   In a cover letter to the draft plan Clinton writes, ``A
concerted attack on the computers of any one of our key economic
sectors or governmental agencies could have catastrophic effects.''
</P>
<P>
   But the plan strikes at the heart of a growing controversy over
how to protect the nation's computer systems while also protecting
civil liberties _ particularly since it would put a new and
powerful tool into the hands of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, data flowing over the Internet is becoming a vital
tool for law enforcement, and civil liberties experts said law
enforcement agencies would be under great temptation to expand the
use of the information in pursuit of suspected criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report clearly recognizes the civil liberties
implications,'' said James X. Dempsey, staff counsel for the Center
for Democracy and Technology, a Washington civil liberties group,
``But it brushes them away.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft plan states: ``As access to relevant networks is
premised on `consent' of the user to allow session monitoring, the
collection of certain data identified as anomalous activity or a
suspicious event would not be considered a privacy issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey conceded the legal validity of the point, but said there
was tremendous potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern is that Fidnet is an ill-defined monitoring
system of potentially broad sweep,'' he said. ``It seems to place
monitoring and surveillance at the center of the government's
response to a problem that is not well suited to such measures.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is making a concerted effort to insure
that civil liberties and privacy rights are not violated by the
plan, Hunker said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that data gathered from non-government computer networks
will be collected separately from the FBI-controlled monitoring
system at a separate location within a General Services
Administration building. He said that was done to keep
non-government data at arm's length from law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also has drawn concern from civil libertarians because
it blends civilian and military functions in protecting the
nation's computer networks. The report notes that there is already
a Department of Defense ``contingent'' working at the FBI's
infrastructure protection center to integrate intelligence,
counterintelligence and law enforcement efforts in protecting
Pentagon computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight over this could make the fight over encryption look
like nothing,'' said Mary Culnan, an professor at Georgetown
University who served on a presidential commission whose work led
to the May 1998 directive on infrastructure protection. ``The
conceptual problem is that there are people running this program
who don't understand how citizens feel about privacy in
cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has been discussing the proposal widely with a
number of industry security committees and associations in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry executives said there is still reluctance on
the part of industry to directly share information on computer
intrusions with law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to control the decision-making process,'' said Mark
Rasch, vice president and general counsel of Global Integrity, a
company in Reston, Va., that coordinates computer security for the
financial services industries.
</P>
<P>
   One potential problem in carrying out the government's plan is
that intrusion-detection software technology is still immature,
industry executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercial intrusion detection systems are not ready for
prime time,'' said Peter Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI
International in Menlo Park, Calif., and a pioneer in the field of
intrusion detection systems.
</P>
<P>
   Current systems tend to generate false alarms and thus require
many skilled operators.
</P>
<P>
   But a significant portion of the $1.4 billion the Clinton
administration has requested for computer security for fiscal year
2000 is intended to be spent on research, and government officials
said they were hopeful that the planned effort would be able to
rely on automated detection technologies and on artificial
intelligence capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   For several years computer security specialists have used
software variously known as packet filters or ``sniffers'' as
monitoring devices to track computer intruders. Like telephone
wiretaps, such tools can be used to reconstruct the activities of a
computer user as if a videotape were made of his computer display.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the software tools are routinely
misused by illicit computer network users to steal information such
as passwords or other data.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, commercial vendors are beginning to sell monitoring
tools that combine packet filtering with more sophisticated and
automated intrusion detection software that tries to detect abuse
by looking for behavior patterns or certain sequences of commands.

Trespasses forgiven _ if the guy can play
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, during his first week of covering the Oilers for
the Houston Post, a certain fresh-faced, fuzzy-haired young sports
writer had a run-in with one of the veterans, a guy with a
well-documented reputation for surly behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Said reporter, unnerved by the incident, spoke to Bum Phillips
about it later that afternoon, figuring the coach might offer some
advice about how to get along with the player in question. He was,
after all, one of the team's defensive stars and would have to be
dealt with on a frequent basis.
</P>
<P>
   Bum nodded sympathetically, pondered the matter for a moment and
then, after spewing a stream of tobacco juice into a plastic foam
cup, said: ``Here's the problem. is a big ol' and there's nothing
either of us can do about it. I'd cut him today if he couldn't
play. But he's a hell of a player, and I need him. So you're just
gonna have to learn to live with him, like I have.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer fresh-faced and somewhat less fuzzy-haired, the same
sports writer is reminded of the incident by the 49ers' decision to
put their injury-depleted running game in the hands of the
notorious Lawrence Phillips, by reputation a bad actor of the
highest rank, the epitome of the stud jock whose trespasses are
routinely forgiven because of his physical prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Back when Phillips, a rap sheet rather than a diploma tucked
under his arm, came out of the University of Nebraska, the Niners'
Bill Walsh sanctimoniously sniffed that such a classy organization
as his never would allow a Lawrence Phillips to sully its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   It was also Walsh, of course, who announced Phillips' signing
Monday, citing changed circumstances _ and pronouncing Phillips a
changed man.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Lawrence says he is. For example, he doesn't eat meat
anymore, which explains in part why he's down to 209 pounds from a
high of 240.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps Phillips, after a brief, fruitful exile in NFL
Europe _ a league that needs a franchise in Siberia _ has seen the
error of his sociopathic ways and never again will beat up on
females, the most reprehensible of his vices.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Niners, their newfound compassion for this troubled
soul is born of dire straits. Garrison Hearst's fractured ankle,
suffered at the outset of the playoff loss to Atlanta last January,
hasn't come around, and it might never. San Francisco's rushing
yards must come from somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, leaner but presumably not meaner in temperament,
produced a record quantity of them across the pond, thereby turning
a handful of needy NFL executives and coaches _ Bum's son Wade, the
Buffalo coach, among them _ into would-be Father O'Malleys. The
Niners, in no small part because of their legacy of championships
and reputation for being a players' organization, won the right to
give Phillips his third chance (strike?) in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Previous employers St. Louis and Miami, by the way, did not
enter into the bidding. Lawrence was arrested three times during
his brief Rams tenure, believed to be a franchise record. Walsh, to
his credit, didn't try to hide his ethical flip-flop, admitting he
sounded like George Bush. (``Read my lips: No new taxes.'') But
with an appropriately somber countenance, he promised Phillips'
first Niners misstep off the field would be his last.
</P>
<P>
   He also called Lawrence's $1.75 million, two-year contract with
its $425,000 signing bonus a ``good investment'' for the
organization _ an organization whose leader, Eddie DeBartolo, was
banished by the NFL for his involvement in shady dealings down
Louisiana way.
</P>
<P>
   So the Niners, of all teams, had no grounds to pass moral
judgment on Phillips, who probably isn't the worst human being ever
to be in possession of a fat NFL contract. He's not under
indictment for anything, nor has he tested positive for banned
substances or an infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
   If he has violent tendencies, then he's perfectly suited for his
chosen line of work, which requires one to commit repeated acts of
violence and mayhem against his peers.
</P>
<P>
   We applaud our football players' nasty dispositions during
games, then wonder why they don't always behave as normal folks do
afterward. We wish they could all maintain distinct dual
personalities, but it's far-fetched to ask.
</P>
<P>
   If one chooses to be a saintly sort and set a good example, we
should stand and applaud him for it. But all we have a right to
demand is he or she earns his or her money, and ours.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen Niners fans up close. Most are of the same subspecies
that populates every stadium on Sunday afternoons. If Phillips
slashes his way to a hundred-plus yards on a regular basis, they
will blissfully ignore his tarnished past. If he doesn't, count on
them to throw it back in his face daily. That's how sports works.

may have its launch site in Florida and its mission control center
in Texas. But it is coming to Silicon Valley for its first
conference to publicize plans to modernize the U.S. fleet of four
orbiters and solicit ideas on how to do so.
<P>
   The four-day Space Shuttle Development Conference kicks off
 &LR; Wednesday  &LR; afternoon at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain
View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA originally was going to have the conference near the
Johnson Space Center in Houston,'' said NASA spokesman David Morse.
``But we wanted to broaden the horizon, and what better place than
Silicon Valley, which is home to new companies, new technologies
and new ways of doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Attending the event are not only big companies like Boeing,
Lockheed-Martin, BF Goodrich and Hewlett-Packard, but also small
firms like Ideo Product Development, the Palo Alto, Calif., company
that has designed more than 3,000 products, from Nike sunglasses to
the Palm V handheld computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get higher profile than designing something that
would go into orbit,'' said Dennis Boyle, an Ideo design leader.
``This has been the domain of big government contractors, but it
would be very satisfying designing something that astronauts hold,
wear or interact with.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 firms have signed up to attend the event and over
40 companies have taken exhibition space in the huge blimp hangar
at Moffett Field.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is looking for the same sort of scientific know-how and
entrepreneurial spirit that have allowed the electronics industry
to keep doubling the data stored on a microchip every 12 to 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency faces a major challenge. Its second-generation
``reusable launch vehicle'' won't be available for decades.
Meanwhile, NASA has opted to optimize its four existing orbiters
just as the military has upgraded its aging fleet of B-52 bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering slashing NASA's overall budget of $13.7
billion by nearly 10 percent, with the ax falling especially
severely on scientific research and missions to Mars and other
planets. However, the need to invest in the four space orbiters and
make them more cost-effective remains a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Each orbiter was designed for about 100 flights, so they have
close to 75 percent of their useful lives ahead of them. But to
meet the agency's goal of going from eight launches a year to 15
without spending appreciably more money or time on launch
preparation, major changes are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   These include making major renovations to launch control and
scheduling systems as well as orbiter avionics, communications,
propulsion and power systems. Many of the upgrades are extremely
complicated, such as using artificial intelligence and neural
networks to control and monitor systems.
</P>
<P>
   But some solutions are relatively simple, like protecting
thermal radiators on the shuttle from orbital debris by wrapping
freon cooling loops with an extra layer of aluminum tape.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's annual budget for upgrading the space shuttle and its
tens of millions of parts is already more than $100 million a year
and the agency hopes to win an additional $200 million a year over
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   That presents an enticing lure for industry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the exhibitors at the first shuttle development
conference is Real Time Innovations. Started in 1991 by Stan
Schneider, the former head of Stanford University's Aerospace
Robotic Laboratory, the Sunnyvale, Calif., company makes software
to automate the writing of complex launch testing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Its ControlShell programming system substitutes icons and images
for a lot of text and is designed to help NASA technicians improve
launch schedules by testing dozens of shuttle systems from
thrusters to toilets. Real Time's annual revenues are approaching
$4 million and its largest contract is with NASA.
</P>
<P>
   SRI International also has a booth at the conference. The Menlo
Park, Calif., nonprofit is combining heat sensors with
grain-of-rice-size radio frequency identification tags that could
be embedded in the shuttle's thermal tiles.
</P>
<P>
   This is a major issue, since the shuttle could burn up if its
thermal protection systems break down. It now takes 4,000 man hours
to visually inspect all 24,000 tiles after each flight.
</P>
<P>
   Inspection, repair and recertification of a shuttle's skin
account for about 30 percent of the cost of turning an orbiter
around for the next flight. NASA would like to slash that at least
in half; smart thermal protection systems could help.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's lightweight tiles also are getting more durable
surface coatings that are 20 times more resistant to damage than
the old ones, which could be cracked by a fingernail.
</P>
<P>
   There are earthly uses for NASA's thermal protection systems,
too. Race cars recently began installing silica fiber thermal
blankets in fire walls and around mufflers to shield drivers from
heat.
</P>
<P>
   A number of NASA employees also have used the agency's research
labs to launch their own ventures.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ames Research Center information technologist Monte
Zweben developed an artificial intelligence program in the late
1980s that was used to schedule shuttle maintenance, saving more
than $4 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   NASA allowed Zweben to modify his software for commercial use,
and in 1992 he started started Red Pepper Software. Three years
ago, PeopleSoft Inc. bought the company, including Zweben's 8
percent stake, for $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Zweben, 35, started Blue Martini Software, another
company with a colorful name. The San Mateo, Calif., firm uses
artificial intelligence technology to help companies that sell on
the Internet better target consumers by analyzing their ages,
buying habits, zip codes and other data.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA is a wonderful technology provider to the marketplace,''
said Zweben. ``Some of most vexing automation requirements come
from space applications and NASA Ames is committed to applying its
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Zweben's former boss at NASA Ames' artificial intelligence
research unit, Peter Friedland, also launched his own company in
1995. Intraspect Software of Mountain View helps companies,
including General Motors, share and reuse electronic information.
</P>
<P>
   Companies and entrepreneurs can win significant financing
through NASA. But be prepared for bureaucracy and plenty of
buzzwords, starting with the Space Shuttle Upgrades Program
Requirements Control Board. It is known as SSUPRCB and is one of
your first stops.

 CALIFORNIA REGULATORS CONFIRM THAT CALLS TO NET ARE LOCAL  &HT;     By DEBORAH SOLOMON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ State regulators have reaffirmed an earlier ruling
that said calls to the Internet are local, a decision that will
require Pacific Bell and GTE to pay their competitors millions of
dollars in fees. For consumers, this wards off the threat of higher
fees for Internet access.
<P>
   The decision is a blow to Pac Bell and GTE, which had asked the
state Public Utilities Commission to reconsider an earlier ruling
that classified calls to the Net as local.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, local phone companies must pay one another a
fee when they handle a local call from each other's customers. That
includes calls placed by Pac Bell and GTE customers to Internet
service providers who use competing phone companies for local
service.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent phone companies fought against paying fees on
calls that its customers placed to local ISP numbers. Even though
the caller's number and the number of the ISP are in the same local
calling area, Pac Bell and GTE argued that Internet calls are
long-distance because they could end up anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the PUC disagreed, saying that Internet calls are
local and that local phone companies need to pay each other
``reciprocal compensation'' for handling those calls.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell and GTE asked the PUC to reconsider its decision, but
the commission rejected that request in a closed-session vote on
Thursday. Pac Bell has been keeping the money its owes to
competitors in an escrow account.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors to Pac Bell and GTE hailed the PUC's rejection,
saying it clears the way for them to get the more than $50 million
they say they're owed for reciprocal compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that the policy of the state of California is for
reciprocal compensation, and it finally resolves what happens to
the money that we're owed,'' said Cindy Schonhaut, executive vice
president for government and corporate affairs for ICG, a
competitive local phone company. Schonhaut said ICG, which provides
phone service to many ISPs, is owed more than $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Pac Bell said it does not plan to hand over $25 million to
ICG or any of the money its competitors say it owes. Pac Bell
officials say they have no plans to part with the money in the
escrow account.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mashek, a spokesman for Pac Bell, said the PUC's rejection
of the company's request does not mean Pac Bell needs to pay its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Mashek also said the company is hopeful that the PUC will decide
to take another look at the issue in a ``generic proceeding'' where
all sides could comment on what the state's policy should be and
who should be paid for what. The five PUC commissioners have
indicated they would like to revisit the issue.

BIG WEST SCHOOLS CONTEMPLATE DIVORCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time the California schools drove the fortunes of the
Big West, the conference wasn't even named the Big West. By any
count, it's been at least 11 years since the wants and needs of
Long Beach State and its cousins were considered first.
</P>
<P>
   But no longer. The six California schools in the 11-school
conference spoke as one during a conference meeting in Boise
Tuesday, letting their colleagues know they want to return to an
all-California conference, which is what it was at birth 30 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The message wasn't presented as a demand or a threat. It was a
request for a no-fault divorce based on irreconcilable differences.
</P>
<P>
   The six Californians in the Big West that do not play football
want to separate from the five that do. The proposed divorce makes
twice as much sense when you consider the five football schools are
located in Idaho, Texas, Utah and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Since the day the Big West started taking in football nomads in
1992, the conference direction has tilted heavily away from
California. Each time a school defected from the Big West, filling
the football void always seemed the top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Long Beach, Fullerton and friends solved the football void
years ago, by eliminating it. Now they are united in owning and
operating a conference that reflects their interests and strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the meeting was for everyone to get together and
hear what each other had to say,'' said Long Beach State athletic
director Bill Shumard. ``There were no threats. No one is bolting
the conference, and there will not be any official action.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we wanted to get across was that sooner or later, we're
going to get back to an all-California conference. It's what the
A.D.'s and presidents at all of the schools think is best for all
of us, and this was the right time for us to step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the Boise gathering is that it took place during
what is usually a meeting of the athletic directors and coaches of
schools that play football.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada's recent decision to jump to the Western Athletic
Conference (WAC) effective in the 2000-2001 school year was the
impetus for the Californians' (ital) carpe diem (end ital).
</P>
<P>
   When Fresno State left (1992), Nevada replaced them and four
strangers -- Arkansas State, Louisiana Tech, Northern Illinois and
SW Louisiana -- were admitted as football-only schools. When San
Jose State and UNLV began their jump to the WAC, the conference
reached out to Boise State, Idaho, North Texas and Cal Poly SLO.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate of eastward football expansion, the Big West
conceivably could have adopted every directional school in
Louisiana by 2002 and renamed itself the Big Easy.
</P>
<P>
   The reward for a California-only league is simple. No one
deludes itself regarding football. The emphasis would be on
basketball and those sports that are prolific in California --
baseball, softball, volleyball, track, water sports and soccer --
and the ease of travel and scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   The savings in avoiding expensive and difficult road trips to
Las Cruces (New Mexico), Logan (Utah), Denton (Texas), Boise and
Moscow (Idaho) could be redirected into more attractive
home-and-home non-conference dates for all sports -- say, Kansas
and Purdue in men's basketball, Miami and Wichita State in
baseball, and Penn State and Wisconsin in volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Shumard said all of the mountain schools understand the position
of Long Beach et al, and that now it's just a matter of
accommodating everyone. The status quo will continue through the
1999-2000 season. Nevada does not officially move to the WAC until
next July.
</P>
<P>
   Boise State has applied for membership in the WAC as well, and
Shumard believes it has an excellent chance. ``They have a great
(football) facility, they draw well and they own their own bowl
game (The Humanitarian Bowl),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico State and North Texas will attend a meeting of the
Sun Belt Conference next month, and officials are encouraged about
their prospects, at least in the interim for football. The Sun Belt
is a hodge-podge conference that features schools located in
Florida, Louisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Idaho and Utah State as potentially disenfranchised.
But the WAC remains a constant flux, and it could have openings for
both. It lost half of its members when BYU, San Diego State and six
others left to create the Mountain West Conference, and the three
Texas schools left behind -- Rice, TCU and SMU -- are considering
their own options.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Big West shakeout begins, the process of considering
other California institutions -- like Northridge, UC Riverside and
Sacramento State -- would accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The A.D.'s for mountain division schools were respectful of
the direction we're headed,'' Shumard said. ``The one thing they
asked is for us to be patient. You can't just switch conferences
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. But for once, Long Beach and friends will be
waiting on their own terms.

EDITORIAL: CHINA'S REPRESSIVE REFLEX  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 28:
</P>
<P>
   In a step recalling Maoist political re-education campaigns,
Beijing has sent 1,200 officials belonging to the Falun Gong
spiritual movement to special schools to study Communist literature
and recant their allegiance to the group. That is disturbing
behavior from a Chinese leadership that proclaims its commitment to
economic reform and modernization and that signed the International
Convention on Civil and Political Rights guaranteeing Chinese
citizens free expression, assembly and religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Falun Gong says it has no political agenda, but it has a
popular exiled leader, tens of millions of followers and a
remarkable ability to organize protests under the noses of China's
omnipresent police. Beijing at first treated it cautiously, but has
now banned the movement, confiscated its literature and detained
thousands of members in a crackdown said to be ordered by President
Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Special factors may explain the vehemence of Beijing's moves
against the Falun Gong. Rapidly growing religious cults are
particularly frightening to Chinese governments because of their
historical role in sparking unrest. New religious groups have grown
in recent years as the discrediting of Communist ideology and the
suppression of democracy movements have left a spiritual void. The
Falun Gong's emergence also coincides with economic strains. Growth
rates are falling and unemployment rising. New reforms advocated by
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji like slimming state enterprises and
liberalizing trade threaten further dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   None of this justifies the persecutions now under way. For most
of its followers, the Falun Gong is not about protest but
traditional Chinese techniques of exercise, breathing and
meditation believed to channel the body's spiritual energy. Those
who have attended protest rallies are simply exercising
internationally recognized rights of association and expression for
which they should not be punished or forced to submit to
ideological training.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's repression may only deepen public disenchantment with
the authorities, and could divert energies from carrying out needed
economic reforms. China cannot arrive at the modern future it wants
by returning to the ideological monitoring and indoctrination
methods of the past.

 Y2K LITIGATION ALREADY INVADING U.S. COURTHOUSES  &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Y2K came a bit early for Mark Yarsike.
<P>
   The Michigan grocer had just opened his gourmet produce store in
1995 when one of his cashiers ran through a credit card with an
expiration date of 2000. The transaction jammed the store's
computer system, triggering an entire row of registers to crash.
</P>
<P>
   Yarsike called TEC America, which sold him the system, but it
couldn't fix the problem and refused to replace it with a new Y2K
compatible operation.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, after more than 150 service calls and no
running registers, Yarsike did what any normal American would do.
He sued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to,'' said Yarsike of the complaint he and his partner,
Samuel Katz, filed. ``We were a new business. You couldn't
calculate the customers who walked out, the stress, the grief.''
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 is still months away, but the pesky Y2K problem
has already spread to dangerous territory _ the courthouse. The
fear of a litigation nightmare _ fanned by Silicon Valley and big
businesses _ prompted President Clinton to sign landmark
legislation last week that will make it more difficult for small
businesses like Yarsike's to sue.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says it will save American
businesses billions of dollars in legal costs by discouraging
frivolous lawsuits. But trial lawyers and consumer groups respond
that it will hurt the small neighborhood store or home computer
user who will have no recourse when their system fails.
</P>
<P>
   Although the law is intended to limit lawsuits, about 50
complaints across the country have already been filed in
anticipation of a Y2K meltdown. The new law is not expected to have
much impact on them because it is aimed at lawsuits arising from
breakdowns after January 1.
</P>
<P>
   All the commotion is over two digits. Since they were first
plugged in, computers have been programmed to recognize years by
the last two numbers. The fear is over how many computers will go
haywire because they mistake the year 2000 for the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of the suits, including Yarsike's, have been brought
by computer users who have already suffered software or hardware
problems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But most are class-action suits filed by consumers, hospitals
and small businesses hoping to avoid computer chaos when January 1
arrives. Relying on consumer warranty laws, they are seeking
upgrades of their systems at little or no cost. Silicon Valley, a
hub of the software industry, has been a prime target of the
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In their complaints, computer users make basically the same
argument _ that the companies providing the software and hardware
knew that 2000 was coming and should have provided products that
were Y2K compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they accuse some companies of holding consumers hostage
by demanding thousands of dollars for upgrades of systems.
</P>
<P>
   The new Y2K law gives companies a 90-day grace period to fix any
problems before they can be sued for Y2K-related damages. It
imposes additional requirements on plaintiffs when they file suit
and restricts whom they can sue. The law also limits class-action
suits by requiring plaintiffs to file in federal court and
restricting the amount of punitive damages small businesses can
collect.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint of Yarsike, the Michigan grocer, was the first
lawsuit filed over a Y2K glitch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In September, Yarsike agreed to settle his suit against TEC
America for $260,000 and has since bought a new $130,000 system
that has his cash registers humming.
</P>
<P>
   Yarsike said he probably would not have been able to find a
lawyer to take his case if the new law was in effect because it
limits attorney fees as well as damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no benefit in this law for the person like myself,''
said the grocer. ``It's all for the protection of the big computer
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Parker, the Michigan lawyer who filed the suit for
Yarsike, said the legislation fails to hold computer companies
accountable. ``The law requires you to give the manufacturer one
good faith chance to fix the problem,'' he said. Yarsike ``gave
them 150 times to fix it,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Marc Pearl, general counsel for the Information Technology
Association of America, a trade group in Arlington, Va.,
representing 11,000 companies, insisted that the law is necessary
to avoid an overload in the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can still sue,'' Pearl said. ``All the law is saying is
slow down, try to work this out without litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who have already sued for upgrades insist that software
software companies have a responsibility to take preventative
measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few companies have viewed this as a profit opportunity and
want to charge people money for fixing something that they ought to
fix for free,'' said Michael Spencer, a New York lawyer with
Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &AMP; Lerach.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm has filed at least a dozen suits, including a
class-action suit in Santa Clara Superior Court charging Intuit
with failing to make Quicken, the software personal finance
program, Y2K compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the companies are providing free upgrades, but some are
not. ``We never promised the software would last forever,'' said
David Furbush, a Palo Alto, Calif., lawyer who is representing
computer companies in two class-action cases. For the most part, he
said businesses recognize that software is in a constant state of
evolution. But a small number want free upgrades for computers that
have become technological dinosaurs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer companies are not the only ones defending themselves in
Y2K lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   GTE last month sued five insurance companies for $400 million,
which the telecommunications giant said it is spending to make its
system Y2K compatible.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The federal suit filed by the Texas company is drawing
national attention because it does not appear to be covered by the
new legislation. John Heintz, a Washington, D.C., lawyer for GTE,
said he expects other companies to file similar suits.
</P>
<P>
   A Concord man with a home computer system filed suit in January
against Circuit City, Good Guys and five others major retail stores
to force them to disclose to buyers whether their products are Y2K
compliant and, if not, what they can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers are in the best position to know that there are
upgrades out there,'' said Richard Ergo, the Walnut Creek, Calif.,
lawyer who brought the suit for Tom Johnson, a swim coach at a
Walnut Creek high school who has a computer system. Last month,
Office Depot agreed to settle by providing customers with Y2K
information.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a dozen of the Y2K-related suits have been settled by
software companies that have agreed to provide upgrade ``patches''
for free or at relatively little cost.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the leading cases, doctors in several states brought
Y2K suits against Medical Manager Corp., the maker of one of the
most popular software packages that physicians rely on to schedule
appointments, track accounts and send bills to Medicare. In August,
the New Jersey company agreed to provide free patches to settle a
series of lawsuits brought by doctors in at least half a dozen
suits.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the settlements have glitches of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The North Marin Water District, which provides water services to
55,000 people, mostly in Novato, was part of a class that settled a
suit with Software Business Technologies of Marin County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The utility received a patch _ a replacement code _ to fix the
program that it relies on to pay bills, do the payroll and run
purchase orders.
</P>
<P>
   But the tiny public utility, which cannot afford a new system,
has gone through several patches since last fall because they have
caused the computer screens to fade or turn colors or the system
crash altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Auditor controller David Bentley noted that the 1995 system came
with a five-year warranty as well as assurances that it was Y2K
compatible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've ultimately honored the warranty,'' he said, ``but it's
been a little more painful than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers say the real damages will come with the second
wave of lawsuits _ when January 1 arrives and computer foul-ups
cause injuries and financial losses.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure how bad the Y2K problem will be and how
many lawsuits will be filed. The U.S. Small Business Administration
has warned that 330,000 small business could shut down because of
Y2K breakdowns and another 370,000 could suffer severe losses.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say there are bound to be legal challenges over whom it
applies to and how to interpret its restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, backers of the law say emergency measures are
necessary to avoid lawyers from taking advantage of what could be a
national crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to insure that dollars spent go to fixing the
problem and not to the lawyers pockets,'' said Barbara Wheeler,
vice president of legislation for the Civil Justice Association of
California, which sponsored or supported similar bills in the state
Legislature. The five bills have been tabled for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Kreeger, a San Francisco lawyer who is advising
companies on preparing for Y2K, said the new law encourages
businesses to take steps now to inform customers about potential
problems. By taking the initiative, he said, they can build a
defense if things go wrong in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But trial lawyers say a 90-day waiting period will cripple many
small companies. They charge that big businesses are attempting to
take advantage of this onetime event to pass pro-defense laws that
they have been trying for years to get through Congress. In
response to these concerns, the new law expires after 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens,'' said New York lawyer Jeffrey
Klafter, whose law firm has filed a number of Y2K class-action
suits. ``They've done a disservice to potential victims of the
Y2K.''

INSTINET BUYS 16.4 PERCENT STAKE IN RIVAL ARCHIPELAGO HOLDINGS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest round of what is building into an intense
competition between established stock markets and a group of
upstart electronic competitors, Archipelago Holdings LLC, a leading
electronic network for trading Nasdaq stocks, said Tuesday that one
of its rivals, the Instinet Corp. had agreed to buy a 16.4 percent
stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Archipelago then announced that it planned to seek approval in
the next few days from the Securities and Exchange Commission to
become a self-regulated, for-profit stock exchange and was
considering an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Archipelago's bid for exchange status comes after a similar move
announced by Island ECN, another trading system. Others may follow.
</P>
<P>
   Instinet, a subsidiary of Reuters Group PLC and the world's
largest private stock-trading service for institutions, is also the
oldest electronic communications network for trading stocks. But it
has no desire to become an exchange.
</P>
<P>
   It joins a list of big-name investors in Archipelago, an
organization that was founded two years ago by Gerald D. Putnam, a
former stock broker, and partners from Townsend Analytics, a
Chicago software firm.
</P>
<P>
   Since the company was founded, J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.,
E(asterisk)Trade Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have all
bought stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Archipelago refused to discuss how much Instinet paid for its
stake. But last January, Goldman Sachs and E(asterisk)Trade each
paid $25 million for a 24.5 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent additions of J.P. Morgan, the American Century
Companies, a mutual fund company in which Morgan has a 45 percent
stake, and now Instinet has diluted the ownership percentages. Now,
each of the major partners owns a 16.4 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas M. Atkin, the president and chief executive of Instinet,
said discussions about a possible stake had been taking place for
six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tuesday's announcement is the latest in a flurry of
recent developments in a rapidly evolving web of trading systems
that are vying to compete with the New York Stock Exchange and the
Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, three big online brokers _ Charles Schwab,
Fidelity Investments and DLJ Direct _ announced they were joining
with Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg, a big stock-trading firm, to build a
new electronic communications network.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the competition, at the end of last week the Big
Board and Nasdaq said they were seriously considering plans to
convert from nonprofit institutions to for-profit corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of positioning going on, but there is a long
way to go,'' said Dan Burke, a senior brokerage analyst at Gomez
Advisors Inc., an online and electronic commerce research firm
based in Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   It costs about half as much to execute a trade through an
electronic network as through an established exchange, and the
growth of such systems has led a lot of top Wall Street firms to
invest in them, Burke said. ``But there is a long way to go,
because there is a lot of stock trading infrastructure that is in
place,'' he added. ``Getting rid of that will not happen
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with reporters, Putnam from Archipelago
said he expected to receive a ruling from the SEC on setting up an
exchange in 9 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regulatory structure challenges don't seem to be
onerous,'' he said. ``An all-electronic stock exchange is a
reality; it's going to happen. We would like to trade New York
Stock Exchange-listed stocks as well as Nasdaq listings and compete
on an all-electronic basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Archipelago, which has about a 2 percent share of the Nasdaq
trading market, is a small competitor with Instinet, which accounts
for about 15 percent of Nasdaq's overall daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Atkin of Instinet said that in the greater scheme of
things, he did not consider Archipelago as a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't buy into what Archipelago is now, but what it wants
to be, which is a for-profit exchange,'' he said. ``In the medium
term, that is not the area of the financial services industry we
want to play in. We are striving to be a global brokerage firm. I
think those strategic differences make this a complementary
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam said that, as an electronic stock exchange, Archipelago
could ``very easily'' operate 24 hours. ``It would be a natural for
us to go in that direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the self-regulation side, Putnam said Archipelago would be
responsible for things like market surveillance. But he said other
functions could possibly be delegated to an outside party in the
future if a single regulatory body for all markets emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love a single regulatory body to come together,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine electronic networks now trade stocks, but that number is
sure to dwindle, Atkin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all is said and done, I think the ECNs will be a
footnote,'' he said. ``There does need to be a common operating
platform for trading all of these stocks. The issue is, who is
going to put the model in place? Archipelago has an excellent
chance of being one of the few winners in this space. But if Nasdaq
or the New York Stock Exchange went public, it would be consistent
for Instinet to own a stake in marketplaces where our clients are
trading substantial amounts of liquidity.''

LEADERS IN HOUSE COVET STATES' UNSPENT WELFARE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont.)  (mk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a frantic search for the cash that they need to
pass their spending bills, House Republican leaders are considering
asking their party's governors to return $6 billion in unspent
welfare money to the Treasury, senior aides said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was being weighed by Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, the aides said. It is by no means clear that any of the
nation's 34 Republican governors would agree to the idea, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to ask the Republican governors to reprogram $6
billion so we can put it into the appropriations bills,'' one
senior Republican aide said. ``I don't think a single governor will
give a penny back.''
</P>
<P>
   The money would come from federal money sent to the states in
the past few years for welfare benefits but which has not been
spent because of changes in the system, including welfare-to-work
programs, and rising employment among the nation's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's spokesman, John Feehrey, said Tuesday night that no
decision has been made on the idea, but acknowledged that it was
under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Although no member of Congress would comment, senior aides said
the idea was being taken seriously by some members, and regarded by
others as quixotic at best.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana said the idea struck him as a tough
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be extremely difficult,'' he said. ``It would
obviously call on all of us to review where we are at and what
reliance we've placed on these funds. Though we have an urge to
cooperate and participate, we have obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the House Republicans. As their deadline for passing the
13 spending bills required to run the government approaches, they
are in an increasingly tight financial squeeze, largely of their
own making.
</P>
<P>
   They are bound by spending caps that they devised in 1997,
limiting the amount of money they can lawfully spend. They cut $26
billion, or about 11 percent, from the budget for domestic spending
this year, and their fiscal conservatives made hundreds of millions
of dollars more cuts in domestic programs when six of the spending
measures passed the House.
</P>
<P>
   But now the bills to finance programs like health, education,
labor, housing and veterans' affairs are coming due, and Republican
moderates on the House Appropriations Committee say they are at
least $10 billion to $15 billion shy of what they will need to win
approval.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five days, the House Republican leadership has
resorted to increasingly unusual schemes to find the money. ``Some
of it is legitimate and acceptable,'' said the majority leader,
Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas. ``Some of it is more questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, they declared the $4.5 billion found to finance the
coming 2000 Census and the $3 billion for veterans' health programs
as ``emergency spending,'' taking them off the official financial
ledger, but certainly stretching the legal meaning of
``emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   The money is to come from increasingly sophisticated gimmickry.
For example, the $3 billion for veterans would come from the
borrowing authority of the Tennessee Valley Authority, converting,
on paper, one agency's ability to take on debt into another's hard
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that left Republicans billions of dollars shy. Hence the
idea of going to the nation's statehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Feehrey said the idea was only one of many under consideration
as the House works to meet a Sept. 30 deadline for passing the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a remarkable recovery in some areas like
welfare-to-work, but that success is not really reflected in our
budget,'' he said. ``To keep the budget balanced is hard work and
we're looking at all different kinds of options. I'm not sure how
feasible this one is.''

 SUPERSTORES DO BEST ONLINE  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Q: There's so much publicity about companies getting into
e-retailing. How important is it for small businesses to join the
fray and sell their products and services online?
<P>
   A: Despite the clamor to sell stuff over the Internet, it may
not be a panacea for small businesses, according to a report
released Monday by Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   Many tout the Internet as the great equalizer that will let
small firms expand their geographic reach and swim with the big
guys. But the Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm figures the Net
will only accelerate the growth of megabusinesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlook for local retailers online is dismal,'' says
Forrester senior analyst Charlene Li. Large national merchants
enjoy inherent advantages in technology, brand and scale that
ensure their e-commerce success.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Forrester figures local retailers will see their
share of online sales decline from 9 percent last year to just 6
percent by 2003 as national players extend their dominance to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the cost of building a full-featured commerce site
running well over $1 million, few local merchants can create a
commerce-friendly online store,'' Li notes. ``Likewise, without a
recognizable brand, local merchants have difficulty driving site
traffic through advertising and portal deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Web superstores like Amazon.com, CDnow and eToys are using wide
selection and low prices to dominate online sales of commodity
products such as books, music and toys. Similarly, large businesses
are using sophisticated online ordering tools, inventory management
techniques and promotions to wrap up the market for other goods
such as health and beauty products.
</P>
<P>
   By 2003, Li suggests that 25 percent of software, 20 percent of
music, 18 percent of books and 10 percent of consumer electronics
will be purchased online.
</P>
<P>
   Local service providers face better prospects because only part
of their business _ such as information, reservations and order
tracking _ are delivered online.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses' best use of Web sites and e-commerce is to
differentiate themselves and drive traffic to their traditional
stores, Li says.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, even though the estimated online market
share for small businesses may decline, the actual dollars are
going up _ way up.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester estimates local online sales will jump from $680
million in 1998 to $6.08 billion in 2003. Over the same period,
total U.S. online sales could soar from $7.8 billion to $108
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, more companies are creating tools to help small
businesses set up shop online.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fee services offered by Earthlink, Mindspring and
others, there are a growing number of free products and
connections. These include offerings from San Francisco's
Bigstep.com, Freemerchant.com of Emeryville, Calif., and Econgo.com
of San Mateo, Calif., which is expected to launch its free service
next month.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to set up an online site to grow your business or
hedge your bets. But do it with your eyes wide open.
</P>
<P>
   TAX PLANNING ADDITION: Several readers called and e-mailed in
response to the column two weeks ago on ways small-business owners
can transfer assets to the kids.
</P>
<P>
   I neglected to mention that many business owners use charitable
tax planning techniques such as charitable lead and wealth
replacement trusts, private family foundations and supporting
organizations to do some good while passing wealth to the next
generations.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 500 community foundations across the
country, including a bunch in the Bay Area. Chris Nicholson,
development officer of the East Bay Community Foundation, notes
that charitable lead annuity trusts can provide income to a
charitable organization for a set period before transferring the
assets to the trust's beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Will Wyman of the Community Foundation of the Napa Valley says
donor-advised funds can dramatically reduce estate taxes and
perpetuate a family's charitable interests without the donor giving
up entire control or use of the stock, real estate or other
resources.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, contact local foundations or visit Web
sites www.giftplan.org or www.leavealegacy.org.
</P>
<P>
   Working with public land trusts and using conservation easements
to protect farmland and wilderness from development also is a way
to reduce the fair market value of real property and lower estate
taxes as well. For more information and links to other sites, check
out the Land Trust Alliance (www.lta.org).

WALTER J. BATE, PROFESSOR AND BIOGRAPHER, DIES AT 81  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.H., N.C., Minn.)   c. 1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Jackson Bate, an emeritus professor of English at Harvard
University who won Pulitzer Prizes for biographies of John Keats
and Samuel Johnson, died on Monday at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center in Boston. He was 81 and had homes in Cambridge, Mass., and
Amherst, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Bate was awarded his first Pulitzer Prize in 1964 for ``John
Keats,'' a biography of the charismatic 18th-century English poet
who died of tuberculosis at the age of 25. The book was Bate's
third work on Keats, whom he described as ``the best example of a
really great writer of the last two centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man who pulled himself by his bootstraps,'' he said,
adding that Keats' life was a fascinating study of the process of
education.
</P>
<P>
   Praising ``John Keats'' in The New York Times Book Review,
Howard Moss wrote: ``The really remarkable thing about this work is
Bate's complete understanding of Keats' development as a man,
thinker, poet and technician. He has the uncommon ability to hold
these four difficult facets _ each requiring, in turn, the
specialized knowledge of the psychologist, the philosopher, the
critic and the prosodist _ in genuine and simultaneous relation to
each other. . . . What we have in this book, in short, is one of
those rare and monumental studies in which a lifetime's devotion to
an artist's life and work is finally distilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Bate received a second Pulitzer in 1978 for his biography of
Johnson, England's contradictory man of letters on whom he had
lectured at Harvard in a highly popular course for more than 30
years. The book went on to win the National Book Award and the
National Book Critics Circle Award; it appeared on nearly every
year-end list of the best books of 1977. It also won wide public
attention for Bate and his work.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Bate's biography to James Boswell's definitive 1791
work, ``Life of Johnson, LL.D.,'' Thomas R. Edwards wrote in The
Times, ``Of this great work it may be justly said, as its subject
said of `Paradise Lost,' that it is not the greatest Life of
Johnson only because it is not the first.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Mankato, Minn., Bate earned his bachelor's, master's and
doctoral degrees at Harvard, where he taught from 1946 until his
retirement in 1986. His lecture series ``The Age of Johnson'' and
``The Function and Criticism of Literature'' routinely drew close
to 400 students, many of whom were ``often too interested to take
notes,'' a Harvard publication once noted.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a sister, Jane Dear of Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In the 25th-anniversary report of his graduating class, Bate
described himself as devoted almost entirely to writing, research
and teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like others in that kind of situation where one's recreation
is the same as one's work and where so much of one's work consists
of writing,'' he wrote, ``I find myself unable ever to say what I'm
doing without falling into a long rambling summary of everything
I've been trying to talk or write about, long and rambling because
one starts to use the opportunity to qualify or try to improve on
what one's already said. That's the occupational disease.''

COX IS IN DEAL WITH GANNETT FOR CABLE-TV SUBSCRIBERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Okla., N.C., Texas, La., Ark., Neb., Va., Ga.)  (lh) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing to expand its cable-television holdings, Cox
Communications said Tuesday that it had agreed to acquire 522,000
cable subscribers from Gannett Co.
</P>
<P>
   Cox paid a high price to expand its cable operations. It is
spending $2.7 billion in cash to acquire systems in Kansas,
Oklahoma and North Carolina for a record $5,100 a subscriber.
</P>
<P>
   The company said, however, that its effective price was actually
lower since the acquisition was a purchase of assets that generate
a $350 million tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the price was sufficiently higher than earlier
transactions to push up the stock of other cable companies. Cox
lost 81.125 cents a share, closing Tuesday at $38, but Time Warner
stock rose $1.1875, to close at $73.6875 a share. Comcast stock
jumped $1.50, to close at $36.1875, and Cablevision System Corp.
rose 93.75 cents, to $72.0625.
</P>
<P>
   While Cox did agree to pay a premium compared with other cable
deals, the company is considered possibly the best operator in the
industry, and analysts were optimistic that Cox could make the deal
pay off. David Goldsmith, who follows cable for Buckingham Research
Group, based in New York, said that he believed the deal made a lot
of sense, since Cox is ``bulking up on subscribers and doing it in
a clustered way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cox already has a huge cluster in the Tidewater area of
Virginia, so acquiring the Carolina system makes a lot of sense,''
Goldsmith said. ``They are buying a scarce resource, and when you
factor in the rollout of new services and what they will do to cash
flow, that is not an egregious price.'' The new rollouts could be
in the areas of digital television, Internet services and
telephony.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the purchase _ Gannett's Multimedia Cablevision
unit based in Wichita, Kan. _ fits into a regional cluster that Cox
is building in the central United States. After its current
acquisition is completed, Cox said it would have more than 2.4
million customers in a region spanning Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana,
Arkansas, Kansas and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Because Cox is paying a relatively high multiple of cash flow,
the company was eager to explain the price by pointing out the tax
benefits of a cash transaction. Cox's treasurer, Dallas Clement,
said that the majority of cable deals are done for stock, and the
acquiring company depreciates the value of the assets that are on
the selling company's books. A cash purchase allows the buyer to
write up the value of the assets closer to the purchase price and
therefore higher. Then buyer can expense a larger percentage of the
purchase price and reduce taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   Cox is the fifth-largest cable operator in the country and has
been creating regional clusters through acquisitions. After its
current and pending deals close, it will have 6 million subscribers
and will remain the fifth-largest cable operator.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Gannett's systems are already upgraded and considered a
good mesh with Cox's systems. But Gannett, which bought the cable
systems five years ago from the Multimedia Corp. for $2.3 billion,
has never been a major player in the industry, which has
consolidated dramatically. This has enabled the larger companies to
benefit from economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications was initially part of Cox Enterprises, the
privately held media giant that owns The Atlanta Constitution and
18 other daily newspapers, as well as TV and radio stations and an
auto auction business. In 1993, James Kennedy, the grandson of
Cox's founder and chairman of Cox Enterprises, decided that Cox
either had to grow in cable or sell out. The company then took its
own cable operations public and used that stock to acquire Times
Mirror's cable operations.

Francisco Ballet's longtime music director, died on Friday in San
Francisco. He was 70 and lived in South San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, the ballet company said.
</P>
<P>
   De Coteau joined the San Francisco Ballet as assistant conductor
in 1968 and served as the troupe's music director and conductor
from 1974 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he became music director emeritus in recognition of
his leadership of the ballet orchestra, considered one of the
finest in the country. Since his last performance in August, he had
continued to act as adviser on the music repertory to the company's
artistic director, Helgi Tomasson.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently invited to conduct symphony orchestras in the United
States and abroad, de Coteau was also known for his work with youth
orchestras. He conducted the Oakland Youth Symphony from 1970 to
1979, when the group became the first American youth orchestra to
win bronze and silver medals at the Herbert von Karajan Competition
in Berlin. de Coteau also conducted youth orchestras in Germany,
Australia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, de Coteau earned a bachelor's and a master's
degree in music from New York University and a doctorate from
Stanford University. Among his awards were the Pierre Monteux
Conducting Prize (1969), the Ascap Award for Adventuresome
Programming (1976) and commendations from the California
Legislature and the San Francisco City Council.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 de Coteau stepped in for the ailing Edo de Waart to
conduct the San Francisco Symphony and subsequently conducted the
symphony in a series of concerts that year. He served as associate
conductor on its national tour in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   De Coteau was conductor emeritus and a faculty member at the San
Francisco Conservatory of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Among the orchestras with which he appeared as guest conductor
were the BBC Scottish Symphony, the Tokyo City Philharmonic
Orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony, the Seattle Symphony and several
ballet orchestras. He was music director of the Flagstaff Festival
of the Arts in Arizona from 1977 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Lee Ming; three daughters, Michele,
Nadine and Nicole, all of the Bay Area; his twin brother, Norbert,
of New York; a stepson, Kevin Chou of La Jolla, Calif., and a
stepdaughter, Yueh Chou of Los Angeles.

ICE BIN THOUGHT TO BE SOURCE OF E. COLI OUTBREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN BROOKS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few youngsters infected with E. coli may have contaminated a
dormitory ice bin with their hands, leading to the spread of the
bacteria to more than 50 others at a Denton drill team camp, state
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears campers infected with the bacteria used their hands
to scoop out the ice and contaminated it,'' state epidemiologist
David Bergmire-Sweat said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, based on a Texas Department of Health
investigation that began after the June 9-11 camp, means state
health officials believe that they have pinpointed how at least 41
of the 58 participants who were infected came down with severe
gastrointestinal illnesses. But it does not explain how the camper
or campers who spread the bacteria had contracted it.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, who are doing their own investigation, were
cautious about the state's assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the ice may be implicated, but we're keeping an open
mind,'' said Tom Skinner, spokesman for the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ``If you think about how many
people were involved, just now we're really starting to go through
the data with a fine-tooth comb. The ice is one of several things
that's being investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say what the other theories are.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned, the investigation is ongoing, and a
source has not been identified,'' Skinner said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials acknowledged that the investigation is not
complete and that there are plenty of unknowns. It is not known how
about 30 percent of the affected participants became ill _ whether
from an outside source or through direct exposure to someone who
was sick, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not a conclusion, it's at least a progress report in
terms of the investigation and what has been learned,'' said Doug
McBride, a spokesman for the state health department.
</P>
<P>
   The most seriously ill of the students is a Colleyville Heritage
High School drill team member who returned to the intensive care
unit at Baylor Medical Center at Dallas on Tuesday. Catherine
Harvey, 16, is fighting increasingly serious symptoms after the
original illness which caused her kidneys to shut down traveled to
her brain two weeks ago, her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Harvey said this week that although her daughter's kidneys
have recovered after several weeks of dialysis, she has other
complications.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Harvey and an instructor are the only reported cases
of kidney failure linked to the outbreak. No information on the
instructor has been available. No illnesses have been reported at
subsequent camps, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that the rare E. coli O111:H8 bacteria
has been linked to a large outbreak in the United States, although
several have been reported in Australia and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria, a relative of the more common E. coli O157:H7,
causes dizziness, vomiting, nausea, bloody diarrhea, cramping,
fever, and more rarely, kidney failure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rarity of the bacteria piqued the interest of the CDC, which
has interviewed more than 80 percent of the 750-plus students who
attended the June camp, Skinner said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigators collected information to aid state and
local officials and to add to their own limited research on the
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the state had announced a vehicle for the spread of
the bacteria when the CDC isn't ready to, Skinner said: ``You'll
have to ask Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria can be spread by infected people who don't wash
their hands and contaminate ice, water or food, said Bob Jones, an
epidemiologist at the Fort Worth Public Health Department, which
participated in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The illness also can be spread from person to person, which adds
to the questions that investigators acknowledged they may never
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of background noise,'' Jones said. ``There are
some secondary infections, some problems with recall accuracy.
Someone who was infected from the ice may have contaminated
something else, and someone could have become infected from that.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials came to suspect the ice after statistical
analysis of interviews with hundreds of camp participants who came
from schools throughout Texas as well as from Oklahoma and Kansas,
McBride said. The ice was not tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got 70 percent of them connected to that, the ice
is a strong indicator,'' he said. ``We'll continue to look at data
and information that we've accumulated and keep trying on a primary
source of infection, but there's obviously no guarantee we'll find
one.''
</P>
<P>
   University of North Texas officials, who also conducted an
investigation, said they saw students putting their hands in the
ice, and officials promptly stopped putting it out in large
containers. Youngsters were directed instead to get it from ice
machines in the cafeteria.

DUVAL: CUP BOYCOTT IS POSSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON AND SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. _ The best players in the world will be on hand
for the Ryder Cup Sept. 24-26 at The Country Club in Brookline,
Mass., but in an interview in the forthcoming September issue of
Gold Digest, David Duval, the Cup point leader and the
second-ranked player in the world, intimated that might not happen
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Duval raised the possibility of a boycott of this year's event
because of player unrest over compensation, and if not this year,
than in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing has been a little overcooked and will probably
stay that way until players choose not to play,'' Duval said in the
interview, which was obtained Tuesday by the Globe. ``What are we
going to receive for the Ryder Cup? A stipend of $5,000 each? I
just might take that money and retire. And we're not used?
</P>
<P>
   Just the thought of a boycott could cripple what has become
golf's fifth major, but Duval is unsure of the timing. ``Probably
not this time,'' he added. ``Although it could. It could happen
this September. More than likely, though, next time in 2001.
Certainly within two more. It's imminent. This is just from talking
to the guys. Some of them are fed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval is on hand for the Canon Greater Hartford Open, which
begins Thursday, and when approached on the practice range, stood
by his comments to the magazine but offered no elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who recognizes the great disparity between what the PGA
of America and TCC will receive in revenue and what the players are
paid, acknowledged he hadn't read the article, but as he looked at
an advance copy, the leading money winner on the Tour added, ``I
really don't want to get into it. It's all right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Could he see a boycott of the matches Sept. 24-26? ``Like I
said, I don't really want to get into it. I think it's all very
well explained what I said. It was written out verbatim.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip Tuttle, spokesman for The Country Club, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``As the host club we believe this is between the players and
the PGA of America. We hope everybody comes on Sept. 21 and we have
a great week of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to contact PGA of America CEO Jim Awtrey were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman is also in the field for the 48th GHO, and he was
asked Tuesday whether a boycott will become more of a reality.
``Oh, I think it will be something that will be talked about and
resolved in the offseason, so to speak,'' he said. ``I don't feel
that strongly about it where I would ever think about boycotting.
If I was a member of the team, I would play regardless. I think
David Duval is probably the same way. A lot of guys are venting
frustrations and they say things that they don't totally mean, but
there is truth to what they say. David's a great guy and I really
respect him because he usually says it the way it is and he's got a
good point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ryder Cup has changed a lot over the years. ``It's evolved
from just being a match between golf organizations where there was
no money involved at all, to now becoming a multi, multi,
multimillion dollar revenue generator for the golf unions, while
the players are still where they were 40 to 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Country Club sold out the corporate tents for $15.2 million
more than 2 1/2 years prior to the event. This price only included
the tents and location. They've since sold tents at adjoining
Putterham Meadows, and the first $3 million goes to the town of
Brookline. Golf Digest estimates a total income of $63 million and
a net profit of $17.5 milion for the PGA of America and $6 million
for TCC.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Azinger has watched the Ryder Cup go from a nondescript
event to one of the sporting world's biggest international
spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ryder Cup in the early 80's was not even on the map,'' he
said. ``I mean, I was on the Tour and didn't know what it was. So
here we are now, 16 years later, and the Ryder Cup from 1983 to
1999 has just exploded in popularity, and its ability to generate
revenue is astronomical.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, the money being generated by the Ryder Cup was
just now coming into the place it's at now. It was becoming
astronomical. Then, the issues were brought up, kind of behind the
scenes, by players about being paid to play. In some ways, I think
(Duval's) got a point. In other ways, it's like to represent your
country, maybe you shouldn't be paid. I don't know. I'm on the
fence about that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little question the Ryder Cup has become big business.
Hotels are sold out. Houses are rented out at sky-rocketing prices.
Corporations have rented nearby clubs. BankBoston has bought at
tent for $500,000 and rented Charles River CC from Tuesday to
Saturday for $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Duval and Mark O'Meara, who is also on hand, have voiced
concerns that it is getting out of hand. Duval's vented to Golf
Digest. O'Meara has been on record for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are professionals,'' said Duval in the Q &AMP; A. ``And if the
figures are correct _ they're supposedly going to gross anywhere
from $20 million to $30 million _ well, where is it all going?''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who will leave here to participate in a two-man
match-play event in California with Tiger Woods next Monday and
Tuesday, said this goes beyond just the game's two most celebrated
players of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe a lot of players,'' he said in the interview. ``Four or
five. Six or eight. It's not my place or my mission to seek guys
out to find out what they're thinking. But it's out there. If you
have players on a Ryder Cup saying, `We need to talk,' what are the
alternatives? Does the PGA of America go to the next 12 guys on the
list and ask them to play?''
</P>
<P>
   There have been suggestions by O'Meara and Phil Mickelson that
maybe $1 million should be sent to a player's charity out of the
coffer. ``Bingo,'' responded Duval. ``That's exactly right. Without
the players, they're not going to have a Ryder Cup. But all these
other people who go to the Ryder Cup to work or whatever, aren't
they still drawing their salaries that week. Mark O'Meara got
blasted for bringing up the compensation issue during the last
Ryder Cup, and he was absolutely right.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman echoed Duval's sentiments regarding distribution of the
funds. ``I think everybody would be very happy with (giving to a
charity),'' he said. ``The fact of the matter is that the PGA of
America does give _ I think it's important that the average person
knows this. The PGA of America does give to the PGA Tour a
percentage of the rights fees from the TV, which I think amounts to
about $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been my opinion that the PGA of America has shared
a significant amount of money with the PGA Tour. Now what the PGA
Tour does with it should be the issue. If the PGA of America is
giving 20 percent of the rights fee to the Tour, then maybe it's
the Tour's responsibility to pass it on down to the players. PGA of
America, as far as I'm concerned, has done their duty. They've
passed some back to the players' organization and maybe that's the
way to do it. Let the Tour handle that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Maggert thinks a lot of the players' concerns are
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think players will go to the point where they'll
boycott, but I think the players have some concerns,'' he said
after a GHO practice round. ``I think the players get frustrated
because everyone just kind of puts a deaf ear to their comments.
Maybe the time is right to sit down with the players and get some
ideas. I think the biggest thing the players get frustrated with is
the fact that they say the tournament's got the tradition. It's
60-70 years old and we've never paid the players. Well, 60-70 years
ago they didn't make tens of millions of dollars on the event,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara was in form at the British Open in Carnoustie. Scotland.
``The majority of players don't want to speak about it because
they're going to get crucified in the press,'' he said. ``I've
played on four Ryder Cup teams. I think the Ryder Cup is a very
special event. I've never denied that. Playing for your country is
a honor, but I think more or less playing as a team is what the
honor is all about. As long as the PGA of America and the European
PGA Tour feel the money is going back to further the game or is
going back to good charities, I have no problem not being paid.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a precedent for professional athletes to be paid for
international exhibitions. The United States Tennis Association
compensates players when they participate in the Davis and
Federation cups. Men playing in the Davis Cup are paid as much as
$50,000 for the weekend's appearance plus expenses.
</P>
<P>
   However, most American Olympians get money only for winning a
medal, either from their federations, the US Olympic Committee, or
sponsors, but they do not get paid merely for making an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert is optimistic something will be worked out. ``I think
the general feeling is the players are happy with the event,'' he
said. ``It's a lot of fun. But sometimes the media will build
things up a little bit bigger than they are. I'm looking forward to
it, if I'm on the team. I'm looking forward to playing.''

ALAN KARCHER, FORMER SPEAKER OF NEW JERSEY ASSEMBLY, DIES AT 56  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan J. Karcher, the fiery liberal speaker of the New Jersey
Assembly for two terms in the 1980s and a longtime Democratic
member of the Assembly from Middlesex County, N.J., died on Monday
at the home of a friend in Neptune, N.J. He was 56.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was lung cancer, said his son-in-law, Arthur
Cohen of Chevy Chase, Md. Karcher, a former chain-smoker, had
fought the disease for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Political associates and opponents alike credited him with
strengthening the role of the New Jersey Legislature in both
partnership and contention with the executive branch of the state
government.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman, a Republican, ordered state government
flags flown at half-staff from Tuesday through Friday, saying that
``he was a worthy and capable adversary who truly embodied the
spirit of the loyal opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the architect of the modern legislature in New
Jersey,'' said Lou Rainone, an aide to Karcher in the Assembly who
later worked with him as a partner in the Sayreville law firm now
named Karcher &AMP; Rainone. ``He made the Legislature an equal branch
of government with the governor's administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Karcher started his political career while still in law school,
serving in 1966 as secretary to the president of the New Jersey
Senate. The next year, he became the assistant supervisor of bills.
From 1967 through 1969, he also was on the staff of Gov. Richard J.
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   From 1973 to 1990, he represented the 19th Legislative District
in the Assembly, which includes New Brunswick, and became an
assistant majority leader in his third term as an Assemblyman. He
became majority leader in 1980, and after the 1981 elections, he
was elected speaker. He was re-elected in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Karcher's rise in the Legislature in Trenton came just as a
popular Republican, Thomas H. Kean, became governor. Karcher and
Kean negotiated an increase in the state sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1985, when Kean ran for re-election, he made Karcher, as
the speaker, and what the Governor called ``Democrat
obstructionism'' a main campaign issue. That criticism helped the
Republicans win a majority in the Assembly; Chuck Hardwick
succeeded Karcher _ the embodiment of a supporter of big government
and proud of it _ as Speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Karcher failed in a bid for his party's nomination for
governor. In 1984 and 1988, he was a delegate to the Democratic
National Convention. From 1985 to 1988, he was on the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving political office in 1990, he accepted an
appointment as a fellow in residence at the Institute of Politics
at the John F. Kennedy School of government at Harvard. He later
moved from Middlesex County to Princeton, N.J., in Essex County. He
spent the last two months on the Jersey Shore because he wanted to
live out his life near the beach.
</P>
<P>
   His last political achievement came in 1998, when he helped
engineer a political upset: Rush Holt's victory over the favored
incumbent, Mike Pappas, in the Congressional race in the 12th
District.
</P>
<P>
   Holt noted Tuesday how Karcher rebuilt Essex County's Democratic
Party in recent years, taking on the role of county chairman and
getting involved with the small details of freeholder elections.
</P>
<P>
   Karcher was born in New Brunswick and grew up in Sayreville. He
received a bachelor's degree and a law degree from Rutgers
University. He also had a master's degree from the New School.
</P>
<P>
   As a lawyer, Karcher had an extensive practice in municipal law,
representing several cities and towns. He was also an appellate
counsel, concentrating on constitutional issues, on behalf of Mary
Beth Whitehead-Gould in the ``Baby M'' surrogate-mother case in
1987, successfully arguing before the New Jersey Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote two books, ``Lotteries'' (Transactions Publications,
1989) and ``New Jersey's Multiple Municipal Madness'' (Rutgers
University Press, 1998), which examined the crazy quilt of towns in
the state. Karcher was a proponent of abandoning home rule and
merging some of the state's 566 municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   Karcher was part of a political family. In 1930, his father,
Joseph, was elected to the Assembly, as his great-uncle, John J.
Quaid, had been in 1898.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Margaret; two daughters, Elizabeth,
of Chevy Chase and Ellen, of Marlboro, N.J.; a son, Timothy, of
Princeton, and five grandchildren.

KELVIN LANCASTER, 74, DIES; REVISED ECONOMIC THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kelvin J. Lancaster, whose theoretical writings reshaped the
economics profession's ideas about trade, industrial structure and
regulation, died on Friday at his home in New York City. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his son, Clifton, said.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster made two powerful contributions to economic theory,
and they were felt far beyond the world of theoreticians. He and
R.G. Lipsey wrote an article for Review of Economic Studies
(1956-57) that outlined ``The General Theory of Second Best.''
Before Lancaster, economists generally agreed that society's best
option for consumers would be unregulated, perfect competitive
markets _ which would drive prices to their bare minimum. That is
why economists used to reflexively call for lifting tariffs or
other barriers to free trade.
</P>
<P>
   But Lancaster asked a simple, if intellectually shattering,
question: Is free trade for all goods still best in the face of
market flaws somewhere in the economy? For example, what if strong
unions drove up wages and prices in the domestic auto industry,
causing production to fall below its ideal level?
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster's work showed that under these circumstances, a tariff
on foreign cars could raise consumer demand for domestic cars,
offsetting the depressive impact of unions on domestic production.
Lancaster's point is that economists ought not jump to conclusions:
when the best option _ perfect competition everywhere _ is
impossible, society's second-best option might run counter to the
economists' clarion calls for free trade and unfettered
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster's elegantly analyzed proposition was that economists
forever after needed to carefully determine what policies worked
best in a world where some markets work well, but others work
poorly. A colleague, Prof. Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University,
said after Lancaster's death ``that economists constantly pay
homage to Mr. Lancaster's insight, often prefacing a policy
pronouncement with the reminder, `In the world of the second
best...'''
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster's second major contribution was to revise the economic
tool for analyzing consumer demand. Before him, economists studied
the demand for a whole product _ how much consumers were willing to
pay for bananas compared with apples. But Lancaster developed the
theory for analyzing more basic preferences _ for something's
underlying characteristics. For cars, that might require analyzing
consumer demand for horsepower versus weight and fuel economy. That
might seem an obvious way to analyze demand, but Lancaster's theory
paved the way for economists to tackle a surprising array of new
problems.
</P>
<P>
   For example, classical theory held that countries would
ordinarily trade with countries that looked like their opposites:
The high-tech United States would export computers to the Third
World in exchange for commodities like copper. But in fact the bulk
of U.S. trade takes place with similarly industrialized places like
Canada, Japan and Western Europe. Lancaster provided the
ingredients for a potent explanation. Europe and the United States
shipped cars back and forth because they specialized in cars with
different characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Only by breaking down the analysis of consumer demand into
constituent characteristics, economists came to realize, could they
understand something as basic as trade flows. Prof. James Heckman
of the University of Chicago said ``Mr. Lancaster's theories have
had a wide variety of applications, for example, giving companies a
tool to analyze how consumers will react to the introduction of new
goods _ goods that do not yet exist but that offer consumers
bundles of characteristics whose demand can be studied on the basis
of past purchasing patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster was born in Sydney, Australia, and volunteered for the
Royal Australian Air Force during World War II. He earned
undergraduate degrees in English literature, geology and
mathematics at Sydney University, and received his Ph.D. in
economics from the University of London in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster was the John Bates Clark Professor of Economics at
Columbia University and served twice as the department's chairman.
He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and
elected as a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic
Association.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Deborah Grunfeld Lancaster; two
sons, Clifton, of Avon, Conn. and Gilead, of Redding, Conn., and
five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was widely regarded as a potential recipient of the Nobel
Prize,'' Bhagwati said. ``He joins the list of extraordinary
economists whom death deprived of this singular honor.''

MIRACLE IN MEXICO A LONG SHOT FOR US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUADALAJARA, Mexico _ So, are the Yanks going to hit the
perfecta again? Are goalkeeper Kasey Keller's arms going to be 8
feet long again, with a dozen fingers on each hand? Is the US men's
soccer team going to beat Brazil the way it did at the CONCACAF
Gold Cup last year, when Keller was touched by magic and his mates
knocked off the Samba Kings for the first time?
</P>
<P>
   ``That game was a different game under different conditions,''
says coach Bruce Arena. ``We don't look back on it at all. That
game could just as easily have been 6-0 for Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1-0 for the Americans only because Keller stopped the
fabled Romario five times. ``It just happened to be one of those
special nights,'' says Keller, who will be between the posts again
at Jalisco Stadium when the US plays its second match at the FIFA
Confederations Cup. ``I'm not expecting to have the same
performance again. It would be very, very unrealistic. If Brazil
has the same chances that they had then, we're probably going to
lose by a few goals.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Germans lost here to the Brazilians, 4-0 _
their worst defeat in 45 years _ in a match that was scoreless
after 60 minutes. And Brazil was playing without top stars Ronaldo,
Rivaldo, and Roberto Carlos, who went back to their clubs after
helping their squad retain the Copa America two weekends ago.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. The Brazilians still had Serginho and Ronaldinho and
Ze Roberto and Alex, the last of whom came off the bench to score
two goals in two minutes. ``They can bring anyone in, and they play
the same way,'' muses Arena. ``That's amazing. And the scary
thought is, they probably have another 50 players just like these
at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians have reloaded after last year's shocking 3-0 loss
to France in the World Cup final, and they're odds-on favorites to
bop the US and go on to beat the Mexicans for the title in Mexico
City's mammoth (as in 115,000 seats) Azteca Stadium a week from
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're very large underdogs,'' concedes Arena, whose
squad looked only so-so while beating New Zealand, 2-1, in its
opener. ``We know it's a great challenge, playing the best team in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are 1-7 lifetime against Brazil and have scored
one goal (Preki Radosavljevic's 1998 winner) since 1930. So the
Samba Kings aren't exactly quaking in their boots. ``Brazil and the
US have played a lot of times,'' observes Marcos, their backup
keeper. ``The US won once, and they were lucky to have that.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the Brazilians have rarely had it easy against Uncle
Sam _ four of their last five victories have been by 1-0 scores.
``The match is going to be difficult,'' says Serginho, ``because
they are a rival that by nature has complicated things for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans know enough not to get into a track meet with the
fleet Brazilians. So they'll mark them closely, try to keep them
wide, hope Keller can swat aside whatever bullets get through, and
attack with enough conviction to earn their rivals' respect. ``Do
we have a special plan?'' says Arena. ``We're going to try to win.
That's our plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans can try to win knowing they have nothing to lose.
They got a free invitation here because the Mexicans, the
confederation champs, were already in as hosts. If they lose, they
can still advance to the semifinals by beating the Germans here
Friday night. They can even advance with a draw Friday if they keep
it close and the Germans don't run amok on the New Zealanders.
</P>
<P>
   So the Yanks will put Keller on the line again, buy a win
ticket, and take another shot at the perfecta. Nothing to lose,
after all. ``There are three teams in this tournament with three
points, and we're one of them,'' figures Arena. ``So we can't be in
that bad shape.''

Cowboys rookie McGarity wants recognition
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JODY GOLDSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ Wane McGarity had one of the most recognizable
looks on the University of Texas football team last year. The only
problem was, he was often recognized as the wrong guy.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting dreadlocks, the Longhorns receiver was constantly
confused with teammate and good friend Ricky Williams, the beefy
Heisman Trophy-winning running back who became the No. 1 and only
draft pick of the New Orleans Saints this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happened a lot,'' said McGarity, who measures only 5-8
and tops the scales at 191 pounds. ``It was a common mistake. It
would make you chuckle, because I'm not close to 240 pounds. That's
him.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity's braids were chopped before the draft, when scouts and
other football insiders began looking at Williams' hair and
questioning his decision-making. McGarity, no sure thing in the
draft after a pair of knee injuries suffered in college, knew he
couldn't afford to have any critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just something I had to do,'' McGarity said. ``You
start hearing things. It all started back at the draft. I didn't
want it to be one of those things where you (question) my character
and things. Most of the people who know me know I'm a pretty good
guy. But you can see it's growing back out. It will be back soon.''
</P>
<P>
   One month from now when NFL rosters are finalized, McGarity
hopes Dallas fans will find him recognizable. He was the first of
two fourth-round picks by the Cowboys, and with the ability to
catch the long ball, along with the hands and speed needed on
special teams, McGarity stands a good chance of making the squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel I can make this team,'' he said. ``They play a
lot of receivers. There's a lot of spots available on special
teams. I feel I can do all that.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity almost didn't get a chance to dress out on Tuesday.
Though his contract was settled on Monday, it wasn't actually
placed in front of him for a signature until 8:40 a.m. Tuesday.
Practice began at 8:45.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be out of the way,'' he said. ``It
was one more thing I didn't want to worry about, but it's over now.
When I came out here, I was real nervous, didn't know what to
expect. But once I caught my first pass, got out there on special
teams a little bit, I calmed down.''
</P>
<P>
   He made several catches and worked a bit as a punt returner
Tuesday as the Cowboys had their first workouts. Rookies and
selected veterans are in camp now, with the remaining players due
to report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty good,'' McGarity said. ``I accomplished pretty
much everything I wanted to. I wanted to come out here and perform
my best, which I did. But there are still some areas that I have to
work on.''
</P>
<P>
   He got his rookie ``Bible,'' a playbook that's more than a
little overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about two telephone books it looks like to me,'' McGarity
said. ``Austin telephone books _ Dallas' are probably too big.''
</P>
<P>
   He also got his jersey. His number _ 18 _ is also a bit too big.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really prefer a single digit; it would make me look my
size,'' he said. ``When I wear big numbers, it makes me look
really, really little.''
</P>
<P>
   His college number _ 8 _ is already taken, and it's unlikely
quarterback Troy Aikman plans to part with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I hear, that guy's the boss,'' McGarity said.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, it was doubtful McGarity would ever stand on
a practice field catching passes from Aikman or any other NFL
quarterback. In the third game of his junior season, McGarity tore
the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, an injury that
takes nearly a year to heal, even longer to fully recover from.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't have been devastating except that it was the second
time he'd gotten such news. He had redshirted in 1994 after tearing
the same ligament in the other knee on the first day of preseason
drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been through it all,'' McGarity said. ``Just to
come back from all those surgeries that I had and come out here and
still be a player, I think that speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   So did McGarity's numbers in his season season last year.
Embarrassing his doubters, he set UT records with 58 catches for
1,087 yards (18.7 per catch). His nine receiving touchdowns were
the second-highest total in school history.
</P>
<P>
   McGarity also boasts the longest reception in Longhorns history,
a 97-yarder against Oklahoma last year. He scored eight TDs
covering 30 or more yards in his UT career; five were 50 yards or
longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' passing game accounted for only 17 touchdowns last
season. Only 10 of those (four by Ernie Mills) were scored by the
wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm out here for _ my ability to run after the
catch, my ability to go out there and be a playmaker,'' McGarity
said. ``That's why I'm here. That's what I'm going to go out to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   A good showing on special teams would boost McGarity's chances
of making the roster, and on Tuesday he worked as a punt returner.
He had 11 kickoff returns scattered over three college seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I was concerned, they all looked like they were
spastic to me today,'' Cowboys special teams coach Joe Avezzano
said. ``Some guys were less spastic than others. He (McGarity) is
probably a little less spastic because he's one of those cute
little receiver-type guys floating around out there looking kind of
pretty. I look forward to seeing him do more things.''

EDITORIAL: ONE MORE CHANCE FOR PATIENTS' RIGHTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 28:
</P>
<P>
   The fight for strong legislation to protect the rights of
patients in managed-care health plans has now moved to the House.
The House Republican leadership will make a serious mistake if it
insists on replicating the Senate's feeble efforts. Americans are
plainly worried about managed-care abuses. A number of dissident
Republicans have heard these concerns and are pushing for tougher
patient protections, including the right to sue health plans when
they improperly deny coverage. The issue is whether these
Republicans can get their leaders to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   Any meaningful legislation has to cover all 161 million
Americans with private health insurance. It should require that
appeals of denials of coverage be heard by an independent panel
with broad powers of review. The bill should prohibit health plans
from dodging this process by defining ``medical necessity'' in
unfairly narrow ways. It should also contain a strong enforcement
mechanism so that consumers who are injured by wrongful denials of
care can get legal redress.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal law bars the roughly 125 million people covered
by private employer-sponsored insurance from suing a health plan
for damages caused by improper coverage denials. Without the right
to sue, there is no meaningful deterrent against abuses. Critics
predict a flood of litigation and a rise in premiums. But studies
of groups that are not barred from suing _ notably state and local
employees _ have found that litigation has been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The House leadership opposes the right to sue, and reportedly
has decided to take the Senate bill, perhaps modified to cover more
people, directly to the floor. But even that change would not be
sufficient. The Clinton administration has signaled that it will
veto an inadequate measure. The House Republicans need political
cover on this issue, and stalling or passing a sham bill will not
protect them from angry voters.

EDITORIAL: A SMART SHIFT IN CLEAN AIR TACTICS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 28:
</P>
<P>
   Government policy makers, like most people, are usually
reluctant to admit error. But Carol Browner, administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, says that Congress and two
administrations failed to foresee the dangers of a gasoline
additive that has helped to make the air cleaner but, as it turns
out, now threatens the nation's water supply. She has therefore
ordered a prompt rollback in the use of the chemical and asked
Congress to rewrite the legislation that led to its original
application.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 Congress required that gasoline sold in areas with
severe air pollution _ including New York and New Jersey _ contain
a higher amount of oxygen so that it would burn more cleanly and
thus produce less carbon monoxide and other pollutants. Oil
companies responded by using MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether,
a widely available derivative of methanol.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE did what it was supposed to do _ reduce carbon monoxide
emissions. But a scientific panel set up by Ms. Browner last year
says that ``trace levels'' of MTBE can now be found in 5 to 10
percent of the drinking water supplies in areas where reformulated
gasoline is required by law, mainly from leaks from underground
storage tanks. Although MTBE is known to cause cancer in animals,
and makes water smell so bad that it is almost undrinkable, it is
not regarded as an immediate threat to public health. However, Ms.
Browner wisely decided that its potential risks outweighed the
known benefits.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a major blow to the country's clean air strategy.
The biggest problem _ smog _ is being addressed by other means,
including tighter controls on power plants and cars, as well as
cleaner gasoline produced by improved refining processes. Even so,
Congress must now revise the law mandating oxygenated fuels,
perhaps by setting general air quality standards for gasoline and
giving oil companies the flexibility to meet them with more benign
additives or other technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. Browner has promised to tighten enforcement of
rules governing underground gasoline storage tanks. The panel
estimates that about one-fifth of these systems need prompt repair.

HOUSE RENEWS CHINA'S TRADING BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Tuesday renewed trading privileges
with China for another year, separating U.S. commercial interests
from a long list of grievances that Washington has with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 260 to 170 to reject a measure that would have
ended the trade benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was widely expected, even though relations with
China have nose-dived after allegations that China stole American
nuclear secrets, the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, a
soaring trade deficit with Beijing, and China's crackdown on a
spiritual movement, Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative
Republicans tried to capitalize on the strained relations to
buttress their contention that granting trade privileges to China
would reward a government that abuses the rights of its own people,
persecutes its citizens for their religious beliefs and menaces
neighboring Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics never gained much traction, buffeted by an
intensive lobbying campaign of business groups like the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and corporations with interests in China like
General Motors, Boeing and Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, opponents picked up just four more votes than they
did last year to end what is now called ``normal trade relations''
with China.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote last year was 264 to 166.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of extending trade privileges, including the House
Republican leadership and moderate Democrats, argued that engaging
China through trade rather than isolating it would give Washington
more influence to improving human rights and religious tolerance
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have a constructive, purposeful engagement with China
or we can have a new Cold War with a new evil empire,'' said Rep.
Tim Roemer, D-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America applauded the vote and expressed confidence
that it would rekindle momentum for a deal to gain entry for China
into the World Trade Organization this year. Such a bargain would
require Congress to drop the annual debate and grant China a
permanent version of what was once called ``most favored nation
status.''
</P>
<P>
   ``China's accession to the World Trade Organization is the next
key step, and one we hope Congress will take promptly, once a final
market-opening trade agreement is reached,'' Dana G. Mead, chairman
of Tenneco and of the Business Roundtable, an association of chief
executives, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In April, President Clinton and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji of
China fell short of striking a major trade deal to present to
Congress when Clinton pulled back at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 7 cut off
negotiations altogether.
</P>
<P>
   House opponents to making the trade benefits permanent have
pledged a fierce battle. Administration officials are pinning their
diminishing hopes for a deal on a meeting between Clinton and
President Jiang Zemin of China in September in New Zealand at an
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain determined to pursue an agreement for China to join
the WTO on viable commercial terms,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Annual votes on trade with China are required under a 1974 law
that was intended to pressure Communist governments to relax
emigration policies. The votes were routine until the killings of
pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989. Congress has
never revoked the trade privileges.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has not yet considered the matter this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a test vote this month, senators indicated that they would
extend benefits, mostly lower taxes on Chinese goods shipped to the
United States, for an additional year.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the outcome preordained, a spirited debate seized the
House floor Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most emotional speeches came from Rep. David Wu, a
freshman Democrat from Oregon who is the first Taiwanese-American
elected to the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business of America must be more than just business, and
engagement must be through more than just the cash register,'' Wu
said in opposing renewed trade relations. ``Real engagement sees
the Chinese people as real people, people like us, people with
aspirations, with hopes, people who aspire to walk the path of
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Philip M. Crane, R-Ill., said cutting off benefits
would be counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nation of 1.2 billion people is more likely to imitate our
powerful example,'' Crane said, ``than it is to bend as a result of
our threats.''

SUIT SAYS ADVANCED-PLACEMENT CLASSES SHOW BIAS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ College admissions officers have long used
advanced-placement courses as an important tool for measuring
applicants and the high schools they attend. But Tuesday, in a
lawsuit filed in a state court here, the American Civil Liberties
Union of Southern California said that yardstick was just another
way of discriminating against students and schools in low-income
and minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, against the State of California, says these schools
offer far fewer advanced courses than those in other communities.
Beverly Hills High, for example, a mostly white school, offers 14
advanced placement courses, the suit says, while Inglewood High in
South Los Angeles, mainly black and Hispanic, has only 3.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU says the lawsuit, based on files from the state's own
Department of Education, is the first in the nation to focus on the
effects of limited access to advanced courses. It says these
courses are more important than ever now that California's public
universities are barred from using race and sex as criteria for
admissions.
</P>
<P>
   At the top campuses, the average grade-point average for
entering freshmen exceeds 4.0, with the help of weighted grades for
advanced placement. The average at the University of California at
Los Angeles last fall, for example, was 4.16.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is flunking out when it comes to educating these
students, denying them the intellectually challenging courses
designed to prepare them for college and holding them back by
squelching their competitive chances of acceptance,'' Mark
Rosenbaum, the civil liberties union's local legal director, said
at a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the State Board of Education said officials
there would not comment on the suit until they had been served with
a copy. &QL;

 &HT;    Sharks bring biting roles to forefront
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in ``Deep Blue Sea,'' somebody comments that sharks don't
eat people, they just bite people. Sharks, the expert said, don't
like the taste of human flesh and don't go back for more after the
first nibble.
</P>
<P>
   If that had held true, ``Deep Blue Sea'' would have been over in
about 15 minutes. But the sharks in the summer's second
get-out-of-the-water-you-danged-fool flick develop an absolute
passion for man meat, so it lasts the usual hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the goofy ``Lake Placid,'' which premiered earlier this
month, though, ``Deep Blue Sea'' will keep your heart racing for
the duration. The plot has gaping holes, the dialogue is often
laughable, the acting is spotty, but the fish truly rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Blue Sea'' opens in classic monster-movie fashion with
four scantily clad, isolated teens making out on a sailboat in the
middle of nowhere. Soon there's something banging the bottom of the
boat, and the teens end up flailing around in the water with the
dark, submerged shape closing in.
</P>
<P>
   Before they're too badly chewed, though, Carter Blake (Thomas
Jane) shows up with a steely glint in his eye, a two-day growth of
manly beard, a wetsuit covering his tight buns and a harpoon gun.
</P>
<P>
   Carter works for Aquatica, a research facility based in a former
submarine fueling station. The station has a communications tower
topside but most of the laboratories and crew quarters are built
underwater.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, led by Dr. Susan McAlester (Saffron Burrows),
have installed titanium fences in the water around the station to
contain specially bred mako sharks they are using in research on a
drug to cure Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   When their financial backer, Russell Franklin (Samuel L.
Jackson), compliments them on making such dramatic progress in
their experiments without violating the Harvard accords on genetic
manipulation, the scientists start exchanging meaningful glances.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out they have violated restrictions against genetic
manipulation to make their mako sharks bigger, stronger, faster and
much, much smarter. Mako sharks already are among the fastest,
nastiest predators in the sea, and these scientists have pumped
them up to the size of great white sharks, as featured in the
``Jaws'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin is pushing the scientists to show positive results, so
they decide to conduct their biggest experiment yet in the middle
of a tropical storm on the weekend when most of the research staff
is off partying on the mainland. That way when things go awry, only
a handful of characters are left as shark bait.
</P>
<P>
   Director Renny Harlin, who also directed and produced Cutthroat
Island and ``The Long Kiss Goodnight,'' apparently comes from the
big orange fireball school of directing, and he fills ``Deep Blue
Sea'' with exaggerated explosions.
</P>
<P>
   You might think''Deep Blue Sea'' would follow the ``Jaws
formula,'' but it owes a lot more to ``Alien.'' A scene where
survivors try to climb up a wide shaft while the water with the
sharks in it rises below and burning debris falls from above is
reminiscent of Ripley's escape through venting steam, flashing
strobes and emergency sirens.
</P>
<P>
   Harlin's breakneck pacing is perfect for a story that doesn't
stand up to scrutiny if you actually stop to think about what's
going on. For instance, how much do these people think sharks eat?
After eating several times their own weight in other sharks and
research assistants, these sharks are still chasing everything
moving.
</P>
<P>
   The only question in ``Deep Blue Sea'' is who will get eaten and
who will get away. Potential victims include rapper-turned-actor
L.L. Cool J, Stellan Skarsgard (''Good Will Hunting'') and
Australian actress Jacqueline McKenzie, who reads her lines like
she's the narrator of a corporate promotional video.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a hint: He who spouts the stupidest lines gets eaten.
</P>
<P>
   For example, somebody says, ``Nature can be lethal but it
doesn't hold a candle to man.'' You're almost grateful when the
shark breaks up that speech.
</P>

ADVERTISING: AT&AMP;T KNOWS WHAT'S IN A NAME

<P>
   If the Mercedes-Benz brand name can be affixed to a
sport-utility vehicle, if the Heinz brand name can appear on
mustard and if the Fritos brand name can be attached to chili, then
why not use the AT&AMP;T brand name for cable television service?
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. is doing just that, having announced Tuesday an
ambitious ``rebranding'' program to change the name of all products
and services offered by Tele-Communications Inc., which AT&AMP;T
acquired in March for $59.4 billion. Beginning next Tuesday, the
TCI Cable name will disappear, to be replaced by the moniker AT&AMP;T
Cable Services, part of a unit known as AT&AMP;T Broadband and Internet
Services, as well as the AT&AMP;T blue-globe logo.
</P>
<P>
   The change, which will take about six months to complete, has a
budget of $30 million just for the tangible elements, including $8
million for new signs, $6 million for new employee uniforms and $6
million to repaint 15,500 service trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The renaming will be extended beyond TCI Cable to include TCI
Digital Cable, now AT&AMP;T Digital Cable, which provides features like
an interactive on-screen guide and pay-per-view channels, and
TCI(AT)Home, now AT&AMP;T(AT)Home, the high-speed Internet service
provider.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, part of the $150 million that TCI Cable has spent
annually on marketing will be devoted to pitches informing more
than 10 million customers of more than 600 local cable systems that
whatever was once TCI will henceforth be rebranded with the
familiar AT&AMP;T name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the largest brand transition in our company's history,''
Leo Hindery, president and chief executive of the broadband unit in
Englewood, Colo., said in a conference call news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The brand switcheroo is emblematic of efforts by AT&AMP;T to remake
itself into a provider of myriad communications services in
addition to its mainstay long-distance telephone operations. The
goal is for AT&AMP;T to keep pace with the regional Bell operating
companies like Bell Atlantic Corp. and SBC Communications Inc.,
which may offer long-distance services in a year.
</P>
<P>
   With the takeover of TCI, and the pending purchase of Mediaone
Group Inc. for $62.5 billion, AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest
long-distance provider, will also become the largest cable TV
company. AT&AMP;T is betting that the venerable AT&AMP;T brand name,
freshened when the words ``American Telephone &AMP; Telegraph'' were
eliminated in favor of the initials, will prove more appealing to
consumers than the TCI or Mediaone brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is obviously very well-known to consumers for the
long-distance business,'' said Doug Seserman, senior vice president
for marketing at AT&AMP;T Broadband and Internet Services. ``And prior
to the spinoff of Lucent Technologies, AT&AMP;T was branded on other
products like telephones and computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Research among consumers found that ``AT&AMP;T stands for trust,
reliability, quality of service and good price value,'' he added.
``And AT&AMP;T is also seen as the best brand to bring bundled services
to homes, whether long distance, cable or Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   While the puissance of the AT&AMP;T name may benefit the TCI
operations, the rebranding is risky, too, because it has the
potential to tarnish the luster of the AT&AMP;T image.
</P>
<P>
   ``TCI is a typical cable company brand with a typical cable
company image _ quite negative,'' said Clive Chajet, chairman of
Chajet Consultancy LLC in New York, a brand- and corporate-identity
consulting firm. ``Those brands have never gained for themselves
good reputations.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chajet said he thought the rebranding was a shrewd move.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is a classic example of a great brand name _ as good as
it gets,'' he said. ``That certainly would benefit any
communication service with the convergence of components like
television, telephones and high-speed access to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for any dilution of the AT&AMP;T image by extending it beyond
telephony, Chajet said that ``years ago I was hired by AT&AMP;T to work
on the AT&AMP;T Universal credit card, and when we asked consumers if
the AT&AMP;T name would work on a credit card, they said absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are old enough to remember, the AT&AMP;T nickname was Ma
Bell,'' he added, chuckling. ``And who is more trusted than
mother?''
</P>
<P>
   The initial advertising to promulgate word of the rebranding is
being created by two agencies that had worked for TCI, Seserman
said: Jordan McGrath Case &AMP; Partners/Euro RSCG in New York, part of
the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, and Thomas &AMP;
Perkins in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working with our colleagues in Basking Ridge as to
long-term plans for marketing communications,'' Seserman added,
referring to the New Jersey village where AT&AMP;T has its
headquarters. The two principal AT&AMP;T agencies _ Foote, Cone &AMP;
Belding Worldwide in New York, part of True North Communications,
and Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising in New York _ are also working on
assignments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Mediaone name, Hindery said that ``we're fully
intending'' to rebrand it as AT&AMP;T Cable Services as soon as the
deal closes, which he anticipated for sometime in the first quarter
of 2000.

FOR SOME, FURNACE OF LATE JULY COOLS, BUT IT WON'T LAST

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ The heat wave hitting the middle and eastern
United States let up in some parts Tuesday, but only after claiming
more than 30 lives. And forecasters say the relief is only
temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Urban areas are bearing the brunt of the death toll. Seven
heat-related deaths have been reported in Missouri, all in St.
Louis, since the heat wave began last week. Officials reported 10
heat-related deaths in Cincinnati, 12 in Chicago, at least three in
other parts of Illinois and two in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Artusa, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service's climate prediction center in Camp Springs, Md., said hot
and humid air from the Equator was traveling farther north this
summer, so parts of the country not used to such prolonged heat are
getting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A larger part of the country is seeing this hot and humid
weather,'' Artusa said, ``and it is preventing a number of cold
fronts and cooler air from moving down into the United States from
Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Warner, a meteorologist at Penn State University, said
there was some slight cooling in parts of the Midwest Tuesday, and
temperatures were only in the 80s Tuesday afternoon across the
northern Plains and much of the Ohio Valley. But some of the day's
hottest temperatures, in the upper 90s and over 100, were being
reported in northern Texas and in Oklahoma and Kansas, he said. On
the East Coast, temperatures rose into the 90s again; New York City
recorded its fifth consecutive day of temperatures over 90.
</P>
<P>
   But the number that indicates what people are really feeling is
the heat index, which factors the heat and the humidity. In many
parts of the Midwest and the South, that number has been above 105
degrees for more than a week. Warner predicted a return this week
of the unusually hot weather in areas that got a respite Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In East St. Louis, Ill., across the river from St. Louis, at
least two deaths have been attributed to the heat. George Foster,
an emergency services coordinator for the city, said a shower
produced a break in the weather Tuesday; temperatures reached 90,
down from the high of 102 on Monday. Still, Foster said he spent
part of his day visiting elderly people to make sure they are aware
of the heat danger.
</P>
<P>
   Foster told of one woman who was sitting in her steamy apartment
with the air-conditioner turned off. He persuaded her to turn it
on, and stayed with her until the room cooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of seniors are on a fixed income and don't want to pay
the electric bill that goes up when you use your air-conditioner,''
he said. ``I tell them worry about the bill later, and worry about
staying alive right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The lower temperatures gave a break to utility companies
struggling to keep up with the demand of 24-hour air-conditioners
and fans, but several companies were still asking customers to
conserve electricity where they could.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued excessive heat warnings for
six states from Arkansas to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, a hot weather health warning issued by the state
last Tuesday remained in effect. That warning is issued after two
days of heat indexes above 105 degrees, and if that pattern is
predicted to continue for at least two more days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand there is not going to be a real break for us
until sometime next week,'' said Diane Rackers, a spokeswoman for
the Missouri Emergency Management Agency. ``This is definitely the
worst heat we have had all summer, and probably the worst we have
seen in the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Southeast, where steamy, sweltering days and nights are a
fact of life in mid-July, some areas are also experiencing
abnormally high temperatures. The Georgia Emergency Management
Agency issued a heat advisory for central and southern parts of the
state for Tuesday and Wednesday. That means heat indexes are
expected to be above 105. A spokeswoman for the agency said heat
indexes of 105 to 115 were predicted, with temperatures reaching
100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, New York state registered its 12th day in the 90s
this year, The Associated Press reported. That is typically the
number of 90-plus readings for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a ``Bermuda high'' sitting over the East, with its
clockwise rotation pumping hot, humid air north, this July could be
one of the hottest on record for the city, the news agency reported
Bob Stalker of the National Weather Service as saying. The average
temperature for the month is 77, but the average this July is close
to 81.
</P>
<P>
   In the coastal areas of South Carolina, where the heat is
usually tempered by ocean breezes, temperatures typically reach the
high 80s and low 90s this time of year. But Tuesday the
temperatures in Hilton Head, S.C., climbed close to 100, with a
heat index of about 110.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hilton Head national golf course, the 7:45 a.m. tee time
is always the easiest to get. But in the past few days of boiling
weather, it has become the most sought-after starting time for
golfers who want to get their games in before the heat of the
midday.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Squat and Gobble restaurant in Bluffton, near Hilton
Head Island, the head waitress, Brenda Wirthlin, finally had to
tell lunch patrons that the restaurant had run out of iced tea. On
a normal day, she said, customers drink about 7 gallons of iced
tea, but Tuesday she sold 21 gallons at lunch alone.
</P>
<P>
   Christie Johnson, of the South Carolina Emergency Management
Agency, summed up the weather this way: ``We are used to heat in
this part of the country, but this is too hot, even for us.''

STATE QUERIES TOBACCO GIANT OVER LOBBYING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York state regulators opened an investigation
Tuesday to determine whether Philip Morris, the world's largest
cigarette maker, drastically understated what its lobbyists spent
on gifts for state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators acted as Gov. George Pataki indicated for the
first time that he thought the current lobbying law was ineffective
and should be overhauled. But Pataki declined to say how he would
change it. Nor was it clear if he would push the Legislature to
impose new reporting requirements for lobbyists and to increase
enforcement of the lobbying law.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which dates to the 1970s, is scheduled to expire at the
end of the year, and legislative leaders are moving to renew it as
is, possibly as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators and the governor were responding to an article in
The New York Times Tuesday that reported that Philip Morris had
spent tens of thousands of dollars in recent years on gifts for
lawmakers as part of its successful lobbying to beat back
anti-smoking measures in Albany, according to internal company
documents.
</P>
<P>
   At least 115 current and former members in the 211-person
Legislature accepted the gifts, which ranged from meals at fine
restaurants to choice tickets for the U.S. Open tennis tournament
and other sporting and cultural events.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, which were gleaned from court records in lawsuits
filed against Philip Morris, provide an unusual glimpse of the
efforts of a major corporation to cultivate ties to lawmakers out
of public view. Some of the gifts would be illegal in other states
and in Congress, which have more restrictions than New York.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that on numerous occasions, the company did not
detail the gifts on its mandatory lobbying reports. In the first
half of 1996, for example, Philip Morris' chief lobbyist in Albany,
Sharon T. Portnoy, treated more than 60 lawmakers and their aides
to more than $12,000 in meals, but few of those were publicly
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   A state agency, the Temporary State Commission on Lobbying,
began its inquiry Tuesday by sending a letter to Philip Morris
asking for more information on the company's lobbying. David M.
Grandeau, the agency's executive director, confirmed the inquiry,
but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Philip Morris, Mary Carnovale, said the
company had not yet been notified about the inquiry. Ms. Carnovale
said the company's lobbying and political activities in New York
were in full compliance with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the purpose of the gifts, she said: ``It's certainly
participating in the democratic process. I guess I wouldn't really
want to characterize them more specifically than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying commission's inquiry into Philip Morris' activities
is its second concerning the tobacco industry in less than a year.
Last December, the Tobacco Institute, the industry trade group,
settled a commission complaint by acknowledging that it
underreported its lobbying expenses by nearly $450,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The group was not punished, though, because under the relatively
lenient state lobbying law, lobbyists or clients who admit
violating the disclosure requirements and amend their reports are
not fined.
</P>
<P>
   Such rules have led some advocacy groups to demand that the law
be toughened, and Pataki's spokeswoman suggested Tuesday that he
would support such a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor believes that there needs to be reform,'' said
the spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha. ``He believes that we should work
with the Legislature to try to bring about reform.''

<P>
   He has biceps big enough to house newborns and an upper body as
impenetrable as concrete. When Stephen Welch is on the tennis
court, he plays with soul and a desire that often has him crashing
into the fence to track down potential winners.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is Welch's 27th birthday, and his girlfriend, Amy
Riley, obtained tickets to ``Late Show With David Letterman.'' But
they have to cancel because he has a match.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, the No. 2 wheelchair tennis player in the world, will
lead the top-seeded U.S. team against Poland in the quarterfinal
round of the World Team Cup, which is being played at the National
Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   When this week is over, Welch will head to Europe to play more
tennis. He is in the middle of nine straight weeks on the road. So
goes the life of a professional athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in a wheelchair has been a big blessing in my life,''
Welch said. ``At first I was aware of all the things I couldn't do.
Now, I'm looking at all the things I have done. Being in a
wheelchair helped me realize my dream: being a professional
athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch developed a love for sports at age 4, when he took up
boxing. Then came baseball and soccer and track and swimming. But
when he was 8, doctors discovered that Welch had a degenerative
bone disease in his hip. He would not be able to walk long
distances without pain. He would need a wheelchair to get around,
and, certainly, he could not play sports the way able-bodied
children did.
</P>
<P>
   The other day Welch was telling Amy how good a baseball player
he once was. He told her he hit five home runs, including three
grand slams, in what would be his final year in Little League.
</P>
<P>
   When he first heard of his condition, Welch grew angry. He was
already aspiring to be a pro. But then he started playing
wheelchair basketball a few months later. He realized that he could
still be an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Now Welch is playing in one of the most storied tennis complexes
in the world. More than 270 world-class wheelchair tennis players,
representing 32 countries, are competing in the World Team Cup,
which is the wheelchair tennis equivalent to the Davis Cup. It is
the first time Flushing Meadows has played host to the event, and
it is the first time in more than a decade that the event has been
played in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has teams competing in all three divisions:
the top-seeded men, the women (seeded No. 2) and the quadriplegic
(seeded No. 1). The World Team Cup is a two-of-three series. The
quadriplegic final is Friday; the women's is on Saturday and the
men's on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   To the average fan, their stories are inspirational. But all the
athletes here want to be more than human interest stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys joke around about the `I' word,'' said the U.S. men's
coach, Dan James, who is not disabled, referring to inspirational.
``They want to be recognized because of their skill. This group is
perfectly willing to kid about themselves, their disability, what
they have to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch is one of the stars of wheelchair tennis, which has
blossomed during its 15 years with the International Tennis
Federation. Fifteen years ago, wheelchair tennis was a fun
exhibition that served as a breather between matches during
tournaments. Now, the players have a full summer schedule that
carries them overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the tour in 1992, Welch has been a mainstay in the
top five. He has never won more than $6,750 in any tournament, but
his travel costs are paid for by his sponsors, Invacare, a company
that makes wheelchairs, Powerbar and Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, who lives in Ft. Worth, Tex., is known for his speed on
the court and for his deadly topspin backhand. Most players use
their shoulder to make that shot, but he has to use his triceps.
It's a tough shot for wheelchair players to handle because the ball
bounces high. Welch developed muscular arms by pushing around his
18-pound wheelchair, which is made of titanium and aircraft
aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   During the winter, Welch plays basketball in an international
league. His team won the championship last season, and Welch was
named most valuable player for the second year in a row. He
averaged 25 points a game for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My disability is something I don't choose to focus on,'' Welch
said. ``I'm here, we're all here, for an athletic event.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch can walk short distances and do things like go to the
kitchen or to the shower in the hotel. Other than that, he uses his
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is such a great athlete,'' Riley said. ``People have to
realize that it takes a whole lot of ability to do what these guys
are doing. When I first met Steve, I remember him being so in love
with life. He thanks God everyday that he can walk, but that he is
also in a wheelchair because of what it has brought to his life.''

TO LITTLE ROCK'S MAYOR, THAT OTHER MAYOR IS JUST ANOTHER MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With BC-NY-GIULIANI-ARK-NYT) (lh) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ There were two mayors roaming around this
soggy city Tuesday, but while the out-of-town Republican one with
the funny accent _ Rudolph Giuliani _ was flanked by bodyguards and
television cameras, the Democratic one, who has quietly presided
over the city for the last six years, was ducking out the back door
of City Hall, all by himself, for a quick drive.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man in a straw hat waved from the sidewalk, but no
one else seemed to notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bit less of a security apparatus around me than
around Giuliani, wouldn't you say?'' said the other mayor, Jim
Dailey, grinning as he slipped off his jacket and slipped into the
front of his Jeep Cherokee. Like Giuliani's familiar mayoral Chevy
Suburban, Dailey's Jeep is a blinding good-guy white, but that's
where the similarities end. It does not come with a chauffeur. It
does not contain any high-tech communications gear, except for a
cell phone. It is not filled with a team of zealously devoted
staffers, though Dailey's assistant did give him a typed-out
afternoon agenda.
</P>
<P>
   And when this mayor's agenda did not quite work out, as it did
not Tuesday, that is where the similarities between the two men _
both conservatives, both Roman Catholics, both in their 50s, both
with heads growing bereft of hair _ also end.
</P>
<P>
   Dailey had dashed out of City Hall Tuesday to try to greet
Giuliani officially _ mayor to mayor, politics aside _ at the
Rebsamen Golf Course along the Arkansas River, where Giuliani and
the state's lieutenant governor, Winthrop Paul Rockefeller, went to
hit a few balls. But Dailey arrived just a few minutes after the
Giuliani convoy had pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad-gum-it,'' said Dailey, scanning the links. Then he quickly
added in his whispery drawl, ``Oh, well, it's not the end of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Which gives you a good indication of why the Little Rock mayor
somehow did not seem to mind at all that the New York mayor had
come barnstorming into his city like a pudgy rock star in a tan
cotton suit. And that the New York mayor had come barnstorming
essentially to stick his finger in the eye of his potential
opponent for a New York Senate seat, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
happens to be a good friend of the Little Rock mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to divorce myself from the political point he's
making,'' Dailey had said earlier in his office, where Giuliani
called him Tuesday morning as a courtesy. ``To me he's another
mayor, and be he Republican or Democrat or independent, I am
honored to have him in our city.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more graciously, Dailey added, ``As I indicated to him on
the phone, I certainly support Hillary, and yet I wish them both
well.''
</P>
<P>
   But later, on his way back from the golf course with the ``Big
on Little Rock'' T-shirt he had hoped to give to Giuliani, he
acknowledged that maybe he should try to act a little more
partisan. ``There's a criticism I get a lot from some of my
business friends _ that they don't think I'm tough enough, I don't
have enough of an edge.''
</P>
<P>
   And how does he think this might make him different from the
other mayor in town? He smiled. ``Well, I'd say my style is a much
more facilitating, `let's try to keep everybody at the table, let's
try to have a win-win' style.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, lest all of this be perceived as a criticism of Giuliani,
he added: ``There are a lot of different management styles that are
out there. I don't know that one is better than the other.''
</P>
<P>
   You could say that Dalton James Dailey Jr., who turns 57 on
Saturday, was born to this kind of conciliation. From almost the
time he was old enough to talk, he dealt with a constituency,
though it was one of customers, not voters. He helped out, and then
helped run, his family's office-products business, where he learned
from his father the importance of keeping the customers happy. And
throughout his political life, the salesman in him has often
overshadowed the politician.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he even left city government and decided not to run for
Congress when he had a chance to become the president of the
National Office Products Association, making him, he proudly points
out, the first and only Arkansan to hold that job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that to tout myself, but just merely to give
you information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But city government attracted him back, and after being
appointed mayor by the City Council in 1992 under a different city
system, he became the first popularly elected mayor in more than
three decades in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The job has not made him rich. (His salary is $36,000 a year;
Giuliani's was recently raised to $195,000.) But in a city of
175,000, it is also not quite as busy a job as Giuliani's, in a
city of 7.3 million. There were, for example, 629 murders reported
last year in New York, a number bigger than the size of Little
Rock's whole police force. But on his own scale, Dailey says he
thinks he has accomplished a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Poor neighborhoods are rebuilding. As in New York, crime has
fallen greatly _ in a city that once had one of the highest per
capita murder rates in the country. But more importantly, in
another accomplishment he would share with the mayor of that other
city, Dailey says he believes he is quietly changing Little Rock's
image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people now see,'' he said, ``that we are not some
hillbilly place, where people go around barefoot.''

NEW JERSEY COURT DENIES APPEAL FOR DEATH ROW INMATE 
</HEADLINE>
 (yn) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ In a move that could clear the way for New
Jersey's first execution in more than 35 years, the State Supreme
Court on Tuesday denied an appeal filed by the public defender's
office on behalf of a condemned prisoner who has asked to die.
</P>
<P>
   John Martini Sr. was sentenced to death in 1990 for the 1989
kidnapping and murder of a Bergen County businessman. The justices
ruled 6-1 Tuesday that the state public defender's office did not
prove that the defendant's original trial lawyers were incompetent.
The justices also rejected an argument that new evidence discovered
about Martini's troubled past might have persuaded jurors to spare
him a death sentence and instead opt for a life prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Writing the majority opinion, Chief Justice Deborah Poritz
argued that the mitigating evidence, which has never been publicly
revealed, might also have harmed Martini's standing in the eyes of
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence, if used, would have opened the door to damaging
rebuttal evidence by the state,'' Poritz wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the ruling, Judge Bruce A. Gaeta of New Jersey
Superior Court set an execution date for Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Friedman, the assistant public defender who argued the
appeal on Martini's behalf, said he was disappointed by Tuesday's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The lone justice to dissent from the majority opinion was Alan
B. Handler, who has consistently opposed the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Martini was scheduled to meet Tuesday with Alan Zegas, the
court-appointed lawyer pursuing the request for a speedy execution.
Zegas said Martini was relieved that his wait for execution
appeared to be moving toward its end. He said he asked Martini if
he still wanted to forgo any appeals. ``He told me: `Absolutely.
How would you feel having to wake up every day in a bed with
roaches all around?'''
</P>
<P>
   Zegas said Martini also complained that he had been suffering
from medical problems. Lawyers from the public defender's office
are to meet with Martini on Wednesday and urge him to appeal his
case in Federal Court.
</P>
<P>
   Before Martini asked for a speedy execution, the State Supreme
Court had twice upheld his sentence. Some of Martini's
acquaintances say he has recently expressed reservations about his
request. When he asked to let the execution go ahead in 1995, he
was being held in a Philadelphia prison which, he said, had such
deplorable conditions that death would be a relief. Martini, 68, is
now housed in the more hospitable confines of the New Jersey State
Prison's capital sentencing unit in Trenton and is reconsidering
his decision, a confidant said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Martini continues his opposition to further appeals,
other challenges to the state's death penalty law, and the
logistics of carrying out capital punishment for the first time in
more than 30 years, will most likely stall any execution for
months, legal experts say.

STARS SET TO COME OUT AS SARATOGA OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ An undefeated 2-year-old filly will
lead the parade of star horses onto the Saratoga Race Course when
it opens Wednesday for New York's 131st season of racing in the
Adirondacks. And ready to follow them into the spotlight before the
week closes are the early favorite for next year's Kentucky Derby
and several candidates for this year's Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The meet opens with a steeplechase race at 1 o'clock, and runs
for six weeks through Labor Day, Sept. 6, with stakes races almost
every day and top trainers sending their top horses onto the stage
in a state-fair atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The season reaches a peak Aug. 28 when many of the best
3-year-olds in the country meet in ``the summertime Kentucky
Derby,'' the $1 million Travers.
</P>
<P>
   The grand old track on Union Avenue was getting its final
touches Tuesday from crews of workmen watering the
mile-and-one-eighth oval track in scorching heat, combing the
flower beds, raking the picnic areas and adding some flourishes for
the fans: a new sound system, a new grandstand roof and new
television monitors from the paddock to the seats at the head of
the homestretch.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meet is two days old, one dozen promising 2-year-old
horses will have raced in the $100,000 Schuylerville for fillies on
Wednesday and the $100,000 Sanford for colts on Thursday. Both will
be run at six furlongs, and both will feature undefeated juveniles:
Magicalmysterycat, the stakes-winning filly from the West Coast,
and More Than Ready, the stakes-winning colt who set a track record
when he won the Tremont at Belmont Park on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Magicalmysterycat has raced three times and won three times, all
at Hollywood Park under the trainer D. Wayne Lukas. She is a
daughter of Storm Cat, who has sired 73 stakes winners. But she
will have to outrun Ogden Phipps' Finder's Fee, another daughter of
Storm Cat, who has won two of her three starts, including the
Astoria at Belmont Park on July 2. And both will have to outrun
Michael Tabor's Circle of Life, who made her debut at Belmont on
July 8 and won by more than eight lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we took a base on balls running her against New
York-breds the first time out,'' Todd Pletcher, who trains Circle
of Life, said. ``We were looking for a race that would help give
her confidence, and not be too stressful. We got just that. Now, we
are stepping up into a different category, and I think this is
typical of a 2-year-old stakes race at Saratoga. What you have are
the most accomplished horses in the division at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Pletcher, the leading trainer at Belmont Park in its recent
summertime meet and the leading trainer at Saratoga last year, is
also the trainer of More Than Ready, Thursday's star. The colt
faces a tight field of only four rivals in the Sanford, which wrote
a footnote to history 80 years ago as the only race that the great
Man o' War lost. More Than Ready has won all four of his starts,
and Pletcher envisions a future of great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it,'' he said, ``we have a horse that is 4-for-4
and who broke a track record in the Tremont that had existed for 26
years. The way he has done everything to this point, I think,
clearly established him as one of the most impressive 2-year-old
colts we've seen in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The rush of events continues on Friday with the first stakes
race on the turf, the Bernard Baruch. It will be followed on the
weekend by a pair of headliners: the 74th running of the Test
Stakes for fillies on Saturday and the 72nd running of the Whitney
Handicap on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney is expected to be a blockbuster, with a cast headed
by Behrens, one of the foremost candidates for Horse of the Year,
and Victory Gallop, the winner of last year's Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   They will face a strong field that includes Sir Bear, Catienus
and Connecting Terms.

SNOWBIRDS FLYING SOUTH WEST FOR WIN TER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAX JARMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blame it on the continued urbanization of the Southeast Valley,
construction workers competing for scarce RV spaces or the extended
slide of the Canadian dollar, but metropolitan Phoenix seems to be
falling out of favor as a winter visitor destination.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of steady increases, the number of snowbirds
wintering in the Phoenix area has declined for the second year in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State University's annual Winter Visitor Survey found
that 3,700, or about 3 percent, fewer two-person households set up
winter residency in the Valley during the winter of 1998-99 than in
the season before. A similar decline was observed for the winter of
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   The declines could be costly. Surveys indicate that more than
100,000 snowbird households take up residency in the Phoenix area
each winter and they spend an average $1,600 per month.
</P>
<P>
   The Winter Visitor Survey is conducted by the College of
Business Center for Business Research and counts only households
living in RV or mobile home parks for more than 30 days from
October through May.
</P>
<P>
   Because Canadians typically make up as many as 15 to 20 percent
of the state's winter visitors, the drop can be partially
attributed to the weak Canadian dollar. But the research center's
manager, Tom Rex, believes there could be other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar has dropped
to about $1.50 from $1.20 a few years back, Rex noted that the
large declines were felt in the mid-1990s and that the rates have
been relatively stable the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think the impact would have been felt a couple of
years ago if the exchange rate was the only factor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rex also said that the drop in winter residents is being felt
only in the urban areas of the state, namely metropolitan Phoenix
and Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   More rural areas such as Yuma County, Parker and Lake Havasu
City saw their winter visitor counts increase last winter by more
than 1,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside the metropolitan areas, the number of winter visitors
seems to be increasing,'' Rex said.
</P>
<P>
   He was unable to explain the phenomenon, but thought the
increased urbanization of traditionally rural areas around Mesa and
Apache Junction could be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``These typically are not urban folks,'' Rex said of the
Valley's winter visitors. ``Many of these people are coming from
farms and rural areas in Canada and the upper Midwest, and the
increased urbanization of the Valley may not sit well with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Newton at Val Vista Village in Mesa acknowledged that an
unusually high number of long-time, winter residents have recently
been leaving the park.
</P>
<P>
   At Apache Junction's Golden Vista RV Resort, Manager Glenn
Eubank said business was off last winter as much as 50 percent
during some weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't see the turnout last winter that we're used
to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rex, the Valley's booming economy also could be
gobbling up snowbirds' favorite RV spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger households coming into the area in response to the
state's strong market may be moving into some parks and displacing
the seasonal residents,'' Rex said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we have been doing better attracting the higher-paying
jobs, many still offer relatively low pay and workers might have
trouble fitting into any other type of housing.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to better explain the slide, Rex said new questions
will be added to next year's Winter Visitors Survey to gain a
better understanding of what may be causing the snowbird exodus. &QL;

 &HT;    Braves seek deadline-deals to fill lineup holes
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The question is no longer if. Now, the question is
who. And when and for how much in return.
</P>
<P>
   Some trading deadlines have rushed by John Schuerholz so
furiously that the Braves general manager was surprised he ever
thought he could make a deal. When midnight Saturday arrives, ``It
would surprise if we don't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the bigger wonder is, given the loss of four regulars
through sickness or injury, that the Braves haven't done much yet.
Atlanta has slipped into offensive mediocrity, entering Tuesday
play ranked seventh in NL RBIs (493) and 11th in average (.266).
After a robust April (.274, 6.2 runs per game), production has
steadily declined in the ensuing three months (.263, 4.8 runs per
game).
</P>
<P>
   The loss of catcher Javy Lopez, whose knee surgery is scheduled
for Monday, combined with the New York Mets' post-All-Star break
surge, make a roster adjustment virtually mandatory. To date, the
only acquisitions have been pitchers Justin Speier (since demoted)
and John Hudek (since designated for assignment) and catcher Greg
Myers, a career .256 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter the hue, no matter the cry, we've done the same
thing for nine years,'' Schuerholz said. ``We try to make decisions
that are right for the organization. This year (is) a little more
challenging because of the injuries we've had to key people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be that as it may, we'll still do what we can to make
ourselves stronger by degrees. That will be a function of what kind
of deals are available for us to make.''
</P>
<P>
   As the club collects itself from a tumultuous Monday _ both
Lopez and left-hander Odalis Perez were declared out for the season
_ the nature of those deals is still evolving. The club is
investigating the availablity of veteran first basemen, inquiring
specifically about Will Clark in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has been seeking offers for Eric Karros, who is the
midst of a solid 23-homer, 65-RBI season. The Chicago Cubs, stuck
in last place with little hope for contention, could also move Mark
Grace, a 10-year veteran who can veto a trade who might be willing
to leave Chicago for the right circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be one of those guys you rent for two months
and then have to be looking for work at the end of the season,''
said Grace, whose contract expires at the end of the year. ``I'd
probably want a guarantee from the team I go to that they'll retain
me for the next couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   But another trade strategy involves not replacing Lopez's bat in
the middle of the order but finding one to add to the top. Braves
Nos. 1 and 2 hitters are batting a combined .237, 38 points below
the league average. Braves lead-off hitters have a .309 on-base
percentage. The league norm is .351.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz has long touted Kansas City outfielder Johnny Damon,
a veteran lead-off hitter who is aribtration eligible for the
cash-strapped Royals. Montreal has been talking with the New York
Yankees about outfielder Rondell White, the Gray, Ga., product, who
would be an interesting fixture as a No. 2 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Adding an outfielder would necessitate returning Ryan Klesko to
first base, which he is willing to do. But the Expos are not keen
on dealing White. They asked the Yankees for shortstop Alfonso
Soriano, the pride prospect in the New York system.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects are not the Braves' long suit at the moment. Of the
top 10 prospects listed by Baseball American when the season
started, three are already in Atlanta (Bruce Chen, Kevin McGlinchy
and Micah Bowie) and three others are either injured or
recuperating (Odalis Perez, George Lombard and Wes Helms).
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk all we want but it's hard to do deals,'' manager
Bobby Cox said. ``It's easier said than done. But we're looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice, Schuerholz has maneuvered at mid-season with deals that
made a difference into October the Fred McGriff trade in 1993 and
the Mike Devereaux deal in 1995. None of the players Atlanta gave
up in those deals are currently in the majors. This month shouldn't
come so cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for what ultimately makes is the strongest
possible team fo the next two months,'' Schuerholz said. ``Well,
hopefully for the next three months.''

DRIVING TO PREVENT CHILD ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a new driving force in child abuse prevention: a
specialized state license plate.
</P>
<P>
   The plate, unveiled today, has a pale blue background smudged
with children's handprints and the slogan, ''It shouldn't hurt to
be a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in January, the plates will sell for $25, $17 of which
will go to prevention programs statewide, such as home visits to
new parents, public awareness campaigns, parenting classes and
support groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' plans to match that money 60 cents on
the dollar _ or a total of $27.10 for every plate purchased _ as
part of its charitable efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The plate will be shown today at the Child Crisis Center, a
non-profit shelter and group home in Mesa. Director Chris Fickas,
who has pushed for the plate for the past nine months, already has
one on her car.
</P>
<P>
   And she has one for Gov. Jane Hull _ it says ``KIDSGUV'' _ and
another for Sen. Tom Freestone, R-Mesa, who sponsored the
legislation needed to produce the plates. His says ``SEN TOM.''
</P>
<P>
   Since late October, child advocates from across the state have
lobbied lawmakers for the plate. They made phone calls, went to
meetings, called on lawmakers' offices and gave media interviews.
</P>
<P>
   There was some resistance, especially in the House, where two
lawmakers voted against the plate. They would have preferred,
Freestone said, that the plate carry an insignia in the corner
instead of the full illustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `We have put this problem in the corner too
long,' '' the senator said. ``The key is prevention. We are tired
of victims. We want to stop child abuse before it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, more than 8,000 motorists have purchased ``I Care
About Kids'' license plates, raising $74,784 since 1998 for child
abuse prevention programs. A similar license plate in Indiana
raises $2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Fickas guesses that the Arizona plate could raise as much as
that, if not more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't have time to volunteer, if they can't afford
to give a bunch of money, they can still do something for
children,'' Fickas said. ``They have to have a license plate on
their car and, for a few extra dollars, they can impact a family's
life in a positive way.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a regular license plate is covered by an owner's
yearly registration fee. The cost of the specialty plates is on top
of that fee.
</P>
<P>
   These new plates join 25 others designating classic cars,
prisoners of war, vehicles that run on alternative fuel and
supporters of the state's universities.
</P>
<P>
   If the child abuse prevention plates approach the success of the
environmental plates, introduced in 1992, it could mean big money.
In 1997, the sale of 40,926 environmental plates raised $1.23
million.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the environmental plates is used for education
programs statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ault, an administrator with the state Department of
Economic Security, which oversees Child Protective Services, plans
to get one of the new plates for her car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good reminder driving down the freeway to be conscious
of the way we treat our children,'' she said. &QL;

NBA SCORES HIGH IN HIRING MINORITY GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the annual report card issued by Northeastern University's
Center for the Study of Sport in Society, the National Basketball
Association received an overall A-minus for the hiring of members
of minority groups and B for its gender hiring, while the National
Football League had the lowest grade for gender with a D-plus. The
NFL did get a B-plus for hiring members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   The professional and college sports were graded on their hiring
practices of members of minority groups and women, on and off the
playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Major-league baseball received a B for race, but was not graded
on gender because not enough information was available. College
sports were significantly behind the pros with C's for race and
gender diversity in hiring. Last year's report looked at race only
and the NBA received an A-minus, the NFL a B-minus and baseball was
given a conditional C. It was the 10th study conducted by the
center whose mission is to increase awareness of sport and its
relation to society. Richard Lapchick, the center's director, said:
``While the hiring practices in sport have gotten better for people
of color and women, there is clearly significant room for progress
in all sports. Nonetheless, pro sport is measurably ahead of
society in these matters.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, the report looked at the National
Hockey League, the Women's National Basketball Association and
Major League Soccer. Although the three were not graded, the report
noted that soccer had the best record for minority group diversity
and the NHL the best for opportunities for women. The WNBA had good
records regarding both minority group and gender diversity.
</P>
<P>
   In both the pro and the college ranks, improvement is needed in
moving members of minority groups and women into front-office
positions, according to the report.

 &HT;    No shortage of Braves power
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So the Braves have spent the past 88 games suppressing
their problems by pointing to their name at the top of the National
League East standings. Make that 89.
</P>
<P>
   While the second-place Mets paused for a night in their hot
pursuit, the Braves hitters, who may have taken exception to recent
talk about how injuries have weakened their lineup, stood up
Tuesday night and cried, ``What about us?''
</P>
<P>
   Using four home runs, what's left of the Braves' lineup reeled
in a third consecutive win, 10-2 over the Milwaukee Brewers. Kevin
Millwood handled the rest to pick up his first win since the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mets lost for the first time in seven games,
allowing the Braves to ``stretch'' their lead back to 1 1/2 games.
The Mets had won 10 of 12 since the All-Star break before falling
to the Pirates 5-1 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday night, Hideo Nomo had never allowed more than
three runs in eight previous starts against Atlanta. But he was
unable to handle a Braves lineup without Javy Lopez, who's gone for
the season, and Brian Jordan, who'll be out another few days.
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves trailing 2-1, Ryan Klesko golfed a double to
deep right field in the fourth inning to raise his average over the
past two weeks to .435. Andruw Jones followed with a two-run homer
to left to give the Braves a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone smoked a 1-0 Nomo pitch to left field an inning later
for his 13th home run of the season, his second in the past five
days, and a 4-2 lead. Randall Simon added a two-run shot off Nomo
in the sixth, and Gerald Williams led off a four-run seventh with a
home run off Eric Plunk.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for Millwood, who pitched seven innings on three
days' rest. Four of the five hits off Millwood went for extra
bases, but he held his own with runners on base. He stranded Sean
Berry at third in the fifth inning on a pair of fly-ball outs to
right field, and Alex Ochoa at second in the sixth inning on a fly
to center.

LEADERS IN HOUSE COVET STATES' UNSPENT WELFARE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: The following story was incorrectly slugged INTERIOR-CONGRESS
when filed earlier. The story budgeted earlier Tuesday as
INTERIOR-CONGRESS was eliminated.)   (mk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a frantic search for the cash that they need to
pass their spending bills, House Republican leaders are considering
asking their party's governors to return $6 billion in unspent
welfare money to the Treasury, senior aides said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was being weighed by Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, the aides said. It is by no means clear that any of the
nation's 34 Republican governors would agree to the idea, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to ask the Republican governors to reprogram $6
billion so we can put it into the appropriations bills,'' one
senior Republican aide said. ``I don't think a single governor will
give a penny back.''
</P>
<P>
   The money would come from federal money sent to the states in
the past few years for welfare benefits but which has not been
spent because of changes in the system, including welfare-to-work
programs, and rising employment among the nation's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's spokesman, John Feehrey, said Tuesday night that no
decision has been made on the idea, but acknowledged that it was
under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Although no member of Congress would comment, senior aides said
the idea was being taken seriously by some members, and regarded by
others as quixotic at best.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana said the idea struck him as a tough
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be extremely difficult,'' he said. ``It would
obviously call on all of us to review where we are at and what
reliance we've placed on these funds. Though we have an urge to
cooperate and participate, we have obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the House Republicans. As their deadline for passing the
13 spending bills required to run the government approaches, they
are in an increasingly tight financial squeeze, largely of their
own making.
</P>
<P>
   They are bound by spending caps that they devised in 1997,
limiting the amount of money they can lawfully spend. They cut $26
billion, or about 11 percent, from the budget for domestic spending
this year, and their fiscal conservatives made hundreds of millions
of dollars more cuts in domestic programs when six of the spending
measures passed the House.
</P>
<P>
   But now the bills to finance programs like health, education,
labor, housing and veterans' affairs are coming due, and Republican
moderates on the House Appropriations Committee say they are at
least $10 billion to $15 billion shy of what they will need to win
approval.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five days, the House Republican leadership has
resorted to increasingly unusual schemes to find the money. ``Some
of it is legitimate and acceptable,'' said the majority leader,
Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas. ``Some of it is more questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, they declared the $4.5 billion found to finance the
coming 2000 Census and the $3 billion for veterans' health programs
as ``emergency spending,'' taking them off the official financial
ledger, but certainly stretching the legal meaning of
``emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   The money is to come from increasingly sophisticated gimmickry.
For example, the $3 billion for veterans would come from the
borrowing authority of the Tennessee Valley Authority, converting,
on paper, one agency's ability to take on debt into another's hard
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that left Republicans billions of dollars shy. Hence the
idea of going to the nation's statehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Feehrey said the idea was only one of many under consideration
as the House works to meet a Sept. 30 deadline for passing the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a remarkable recovery in some areas like
welfare-to-work, but that success is not really reflected in our
budget,'' he said. ``To keep the budget balanced is hard work and
we're looking at all different kinds of options. I'm not sure how
feasible this one is.''

TIMES IN A JOINT INTERNET NEWS OPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Times said Tuesday that it was
establishing a joint news operation with TheStreet.com, an online
financial news service, as part of the Times' effort to expand and
enhance its presence on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said that the goal of the alliance was to help The
Times provide regularly updated business news and analysis on its
Web site, and that the initiative was one of several aimed at
differentiating the Times' Internet offerings from those of its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not presuming that the stories are going to appear in
our paper; their prime purpose is to serve the Web audience,''
Joseph Lelyveld, executive editor of The Times, said in a
statement. ``That said, we expect that many of the readers drawn to
The Times by the upgraded spot business coverage on our Web site
will gravitate to the newspaper itself for greater depth and
analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper said that Jack Lynch, an assistant business editor
with The Times, would help hire and oversee six reporters for
TheStreet.com and would report to Lelyveld and Dave Kansas,
TheStreet.com's editor in chief.
</P>
<P>
   In February, New York Times Co. agreed to invest $15 million in
cash and services for a minority stake in TheStreet.com, which made
its initial public stock offering in May.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: OH, TO BE YOUNG AND AT THE WRONG WOODSTOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that Woodstock '99 has ended in a nasty and embarrassing
riot, young people are no doubt dying to hear more about how nice
the original was in 1969, when there were no ripoff vendors selling
$4 bottles of water and we all shared food and lived in peace and
yada yada yada yada yada.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago I went to a concert with about 500,000
acquaintances and wound up stranded for several days in Bethel,
N.Y., in inclement weather with not much in the way of food and
even less security. We managed to get along and enjoy ourselves
while creating a landmark in American cultural history in our spare
time. Obviously, the lesson is that we were nicer than kids today
and that everybody under 30 made a terrible mistake by failing to
be born right after World War II, when all the truly cool people
were coming into the world.
</P>
<P>
   Truthfully, I've always believed that the secret of the original
Woodstock's success, the thing that turned chaos into gold, was
pure terror. Circumstances that nobody anticipated had left us in
the middle of nowhere, the roads clogged and impassable in every
direction, with no way for us to get out or anybody else to get in.
We were on our own, and if we behaved well, it was probably because
we knew there was nobody to protect us from ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   The guards who had been hired to provide security for the
concert _ many of whom seemed to be off-duty New York City police _
were as isolated as the rest of us, cut off from their hotels and
their supervisors by the impassable roads. I remember feeding a
couple of them, who huddled miserably by our campfire in the chilly
damp night. Police were not particularly popular with the Woodstock
set, but the idea that the forces of law and order were either
going to flee on foot or starve to death was nevertheless
unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people at the concert, of course, did not give the
slightest thought to the possible consequences _ I am thinking of
the ones who thought it was a good plan to take pills from perfect
strangers and pop them in their mouths. But when the music ended at
night and you found yourself walking through the dark, packed in
the middle of several hundred thousand adolescents, it was hard to
avoid contemplating what would happen if somebody suddenly yelled
``Fire!'' and started pushing.
</P>
<P>
   The great irony of Woodstock '99 was not that it was held at an
abandoned Air Force base, near the place where they used to keep
the nuclear weapons. It was that the very amenities the producers
provided eliminated that sense of repressed wariness that pervaded
the original as much as mud and the smell of marijuana. Having
learned the lesson of the gate-crashers at Woodstock '69 and '94,
the organizers created a sort of monster fortress in Rome, N.Y.,
for this summer's concert, and filled it with souvenir stands and
fast-food outlets and videogame parlors and cash machines. The
overpriced soda and pizza might have made the kids feel ripped off,
but the very availability of so much bounty was proof that they
were still in civilization, under the protection of unseen but
efficient corporate authority figures.
</P>
<P>
   One of my strongest memories of the original Woodstock was of an
argument between a state trooper and a desperate farmer who was
trying to drive against traffic down a one-lane road that was lined
on both sides with abandoned vehicles. ``I gotta get home and milk
my cows,'' the farmer said, as the stream of pilgrims continued to
march, ride, walk, skip and otherwise make their way toward the
distant mecca where music was actually alleged to be happening.
</P>
<P>
   The trooper shook his head sadly and pointed the farmer in the
other direction. His cows could not have been more unreachable if
they had been parked on a floe in the middle of the Arctic Ocean. I
imagined them exploding, unsung victims of the Woodstock
phenomenon. It was another worry to add to stampedes, pneumonia and
midnight assault by drug-deluded maniacs.
</P>
<P>
   Along with music and good intentions, Woodstock '69 was created
by the consciousness of terrible possibilities. You can't recreate
it at five-year intervals. Trying is an awful idea, as bad as a
Beatles reunion or the ``Avengers'' movie. Bury the concept and let
this generation find its own disasters to avert.

IN-YOUR-FACE PLAYER BOWLING OVER FANS ON TOUR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILFORD, Conn. _ Looking like a man not accustomed to rising
early, Rudy Kasimakis kept yawning. It was 8 o'clock in the morning
and he was about to start bowling during Tuesday's second round of
the U.S. Open at AMF Milford Lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There've been a lot of days when I bowled until 8 o'clock in
the morning,'' Kasimakis said. ``But starting to bowl this early is
going to take getting used to.''
</P>
<P>
   In alluding to the many times he wandered out of bowling alleys
squinting at the early-morning sunlight, the 34-year-old Kasimakis
was remembering the years he played for big stakes as an ``action''
bowler while eschewing the Professional Bowlers Association Tour.
But now the flamboyant Kasimakis _ Rudy Revs, as he is known in
bowling circles _ has become part of the establishment after more
than a decade of going head-to-head with scores of bowlers, local
hot shots and professionals, in smoky, dimly lit alleys across the
United States and as far away as Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Although he ranks 20th on the prize money list and has yet to
win a PBA tournament, Kasimakis, a native of Hicksville, N.Y., has
become the biggest attraction on a tour that lacks players who
combine flair with talent. The 5-foot-7-inch, 250-pound Kasimakis
stands out as much for his sweeping high-arc windup, huge hook and
powerful delivery as he does for his robust build, thick neck and
dark goatee.
</P>
<P>
   The PBA Tour is essentially a collection of highly talented but
indistinguishable participants, and is a virtual nonentity in the
sports world.
</P>
<P>
   So, is the tour ready for Kasimakis, a swaggering,
trash-talking, in-your-face competitor accustomed to bowling while
betting his money against his opponents and usually winning? The
answer, from spectators, bowlers and the PBA commissioner, Mark
Gerberich, seems to be yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy not only is a great bowler, but he has a terrific rapport
with the fans,'' Gerberich said. ``Not all action bowlers can make
the transition, since our game is totally different and requires
more consistency. And he's attracting more attention to the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Ozio, a former action bowler who has won 11 titles,
conceded that Kasimakis can be intimidating, ``although we don't
let that bother us.'' Ozio said that most of the pros welcomed
Kasimakis on the tour. ``We need more animated players,'' said the
44-year-old Ozio, a member of the PBA Hall of Fame. ``We have
enough monotones out there as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasimakis, who spent a brief spell on the tour a decade ago,
agrees. ``The tour needs more color,'' said Kasimakis who, until a
few years ago, still worked part time in the pro shop at Mid-Island
Bowl in Hicksville and at Bay Shore Bowl. ``They have to attract
more viewers and spectators, especially young people.''
</P>
<P>
   During his long years in the shadows of bowling, he competed in
every conceivable type of betting game, including games where the
lowest score won, but with bowlers having to knock down at least
one pin, and games where bowlers rolled from behind the scorer's
table.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's on the tour and even has three sponsors. Through 16
tournaments this year, Kasimakis has earned $34,750, finished
second twice and in the top five three times. With a 215.5 average
through 16 games here, he seemed poised to qualify for the next
round on Thursday after the field has been cut from 180 to 45. Both
the men's and women's winners of Sunday's finals will receive
$35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Married and the father of two children, Kasimakis said he
decided to give up the life of an action bowler to spend more time
with his family at their home in Gouldsboro, Pa., in the Pocono
Mountains. ``I also was ready to go on to the next step,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That next step has produced a more subdued Kasimakis. He seems
to have refrained from trying to intimidate his new colleagues on
the tour. Are those days over, he was asked. ``I don't think so,''
he said with a smile. ``I'm going to be me, and I think I still get
under some people's skins.''  &QL;

HISPANIC COALITION CALLS FOR TV BOYCOTT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LORI RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A national coalition of Latino groups is asking all
Hispanics to boycott the four major TV networks in September to
protest the ``brownout'' of Latino characters on prime-time
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``If network executives have created a brownout of Latinos on
television, then Latinos will brownout television in response,''
said Felix Sanchez, president of the National Hispanic Foundation
for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation and nine other groups called for the one-week
boycott beginning Sept. 12 following an emergency summit during the
National Council of La Raza annual conference meeting in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 12 coincides with National Hispanic Heritage Week.
</P>
<P>
   The conference of more than 240 affiliate Latino organizations
concludes Wednesday at the George R. Brown Convention Center. Vice
President Al Gore is scheduled to deliver a luncheon speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Latino boycott comes on the heels of an announcement two
weeks ago by the NAACP that it also is considering boycotts and
legal action unless networks diversify their programming.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Nogales, spokesman for the National Hispanic Media
Coalition, said Latinos were ``mad as hell'' when they learned that
of the 26 new shows on the fall lineup, only one includes a
minority in a primary or secondary role. Actor Martin Sheen (born
Ramon Estevez) will star on NBC-TV's ``West Wing,'' beginning in
the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's par for the course,'' said Nogales. ``We're all tired
of talking to the networks about the same thing and having the same
promises given to us to achieve absolutely nothing at the end of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change has to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Latino groups plan a meeting in Washington the week of Sept.
12 to formally launch the boycott and take additional action they
say could include legal and regulatory remedies, appeals to
advertisers and purchasing network stock to influence stockholder
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the initial part of a broader fight,'' said La
Raza President Raul Yzaguirre, citing the collective $380 billion
annual purchasing power of the nation's 31 million Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect this to be a protracted battle and we expect to
announce a series of other initiatives in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanics make up 11 percent of the American population,
they are less than 2 percent of the characters on prime-time
television shows and are portrayed more negatively and
stereotypically than other groups, coalition members said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Cosby said `The Bill Cosby Show' did more for civil
rights than any piece of civil rights legislation because we had an
experience with black America. We understood black America to be no
different than who we were as regular Americans,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is to say Latinos are regular Americans and we have yet
to have that simple statement reflected on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC said in a statement that including minorities is a top
priority. ``Although we are very proud of the minority
representation in many of NBC's dramas, including ''ER,`` ''Law &AMP;
Order,`` the upcoming ''Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit`` and
''Third Watch,`` we realize that there is still work to be done.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A CBS spokesman Tuesday referred to comments made earlier in
the week by CBS President Leslie Moonves in which he admitted that
``a lot more needs to be done about Latino inclusion.'' Moonves
said CBS had just added a Latino character to ``Family Law,'' a new
fall series, as well as specials featuring cross-over singers
Gloria Estefan and Ricky Martin.
</P>
<P>
   But while Moonves agreed television should reflect the racial
composition of America, he added, ``We do not think it fair that
the network of Bill Cosby (''Cosby,`` ''Kids Say the Darndest
Things``), Della Reese (Touched by an Angel), Cheech Marin (Nash
Bridges) and Arsenio Hall and Sammo Hung (Martial Law) should be
accused of not recognizing the minority audience.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said he wants to meet with La Raza, the NAACP and any
other groups protesting the lack of diversity in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Dandridge, ABC vice president of communications, pointed out
that ABC airs the annual ALMA awards show, a La Raza-produced
counterpart to the Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoy a close relationship with them and we are willing to
meet with them or any organization that has constructive ideas on
how to address this very serious issue,'' Dandridge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize we need to do more; we are doing more. Judge us
by what we do in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Coalition members, which also include the League of United Latin
American Citizens and the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund, said they would seek a meeting with the NAACP to
pursue a joint effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only asking that people reflect the truth of where we
are,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at all those shows set in New York and you have
this incredible mosaic of people living in that city and you only
reflect all-white people on a show like `Friends,' the issue is,
are there no amigos in New York?''
</P>
<P>
   On the week of the boycott, coalition leaders are urging Latinos
and sympathetic Americans of all backgrounds to rent videos
featuring Latino themes or read Latino literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live in a fenced-in community, you see Latinos as your
gardener, as your maid, as your nanny, as the busboy and the
waiter, and we're there, there's no question, they're honest
jobs,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are more than that and that is what people fail to
see.''

AUSTRALIANS FIGHT FOR THE CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A learning opportunity presents itself this week
for those who envision themselves taking a major leap in the
rankings. They might want to watch Australians Lleyton Hewitt and
Andrew Ilie.
</P>
<P>
   They made the greatest leaps last year. The 18-year-old Hewitt,
seeded seventh, jumped 609 spots to 113 and has since climbed to
33. Ilie ended 1997 ranked 473 and finished 1998 at 59, a leap of
414 positions. He's currently 61st.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being Aussies (Ilie is naturalized; he was born in
Romania), the pair share other traits. They're both aggressive
baseliners who hit solid ground strokes and return serves well.
</P>
<P>
   They also never give up, which served Ilie well in his match
Tuesday against Byron Black. Ilie won in straight sets but served
for the match leading 6-4, 5-3 and lost. Black fought back to force
a tiebreaker, and Ilie missed on two other match points before
finally winning 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighters out there. We really want it,'' Ilie said. ``I
enjoy a good fight. I come back all the time. I value the important
points out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar face: Hewitt must have felt a sense of deja vu when he
looked across the court and saw Alex O'Brien as his first-round
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   It was nine days ago in Boston that Hewitt defeated O'Brien in a
Davis Cup reverse singles match.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt was disappointed he didn't get to face Pete Sampras, but
Australia's coach, John Newcombe, told him to pay attention anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sat me down and said, `You could face him later on the
tour,''' Hewitt said. ``You could have a psychological advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   So here they were again, and there was Hewitt winning again,
this time 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   It's safer: Hewitt used to play Australian-rules football until
age 13, when he decided he could make more money and not get as
badly hurt by playing tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Injuries did come into it,'' he said, ``but I was a little bit
better at tennis at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pull the monkey out of the bag: That's the saying Ilie's coach,
Nels Van Patten, has for Ilie when he's struggling and needs to
work some on-court magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a new motto,'' Ilie said. ``It's like pulling a
rabbit out of the hat.''

COLUMBIA CREW LANDS AT NIGHT 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., _ The Columbia astronauts swooped to a
rare night landing late Tuesday in Florida, concluding a successful
five-day mission to deploy the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters had monitored storms in the area earlier in the day
before mission control cleared the shuttle's return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Under a moonlit sky, astronaut Eileen Collins, the first female
spacecraft commander, steered the 220,000-pound spacecraft onto the
brightly lit shuttle runway at NASA's Kennedy Space Center at 11:20
p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really enjoyed this mission,'' said Collins, a
42-year-old Air Force colonel and test pilot, as her crew prepared
for re-entry. ``It's been absolutely super.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only the 12th time a shuttle has landed in darkness in 95
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, pilot Jeff Ashby, flight engineer Steve Hawley, mission
specialist Catherine ``Cady'' Coleman and French astronaut Michel
Tognini were to undergo medical evaluations, meet with family
members and rest.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle crew planned to fly back to Houston on Wednesday at
the Johnson Space Center workers planned a brief public welcoming
ceremony at Ellington Field.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia blasted off Thursday night. Early the next morning,
Coleman led efforts to successfully deploy NASA's $1.55 billion
Chandra X-ray Observatory, the shuttle's primary payload. The
40-foot-long telescope was designed to assist astronomers in their
studies of the evolution of the universe. Specifically, it is
intended to help explain the role of black holes, quasars,
exploding stars and galactic collisions.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Columbia's launch was especially dramatic for
Collins and her crew. Within seconds, there was a momentary
electrical short that knocked out the primary controllers on two of
Columbia's three main rocket engines. Midway through the flight,
shuttle engineers released photographic evidence of a small leak of
explosive hydrogen fuel from the exhaust nozzle of the right
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Either problem could have caused the shuttle's rockets to shut
down prematurely during the eight-and-a-half-minute ascent, forcing
Collins and Ashby to attempt an emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The space program is a risky business,'' Coleman said,
reflecting on the risks the astronauts encountered. ``I do think
it's worth every single thing it took us to get up here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The telescope is so beautiful, and the information it will
send back is so fascinating,'' Coleman said. ``I think it will
answer questions we don't even know we have.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kennedy, ground crews prepared a hangar for Columbia where
engineers were to begin inspections of the narrow, stainless-steel
cooling tubes of the right rocket engine nozzle for potential
cracks or corrosive penetrations that could have been the source of
the fuel leak. Supercold liquid hydrogen from the shuttle's fuel
tanks circulates through the tubing on its way to the engine's
combustion chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers also will pour over the center engine and its
controller, the suspected source of the electrical short.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot more analysis that has to be done before we
know exactly what happened,'' Collins told a pre-landing news
conference from orbit. ``I know the shuttle program will be taking
action in the future to assure this won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Chandra's ground-control center in Cambridge,
Mass., engineers said Tuesday they have begun to activate the
scientific instruments and prepare for the third in a series of
maneuvers to place the telescope beyond the Earth's Van Allen
radiation belt.
</P>
<P>
   Within several days, the observatory should be circling the
Earth in an elliptical orbit with low and high points just over
6,200 miles and just under 87,000 miles. The first images should be
transmitted to Earth between mid-and late August.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra was designed for at least five years of operation.
</P>
<P>
   After its return, Columbia, the oldest of NASA's shuttles, is to
undergo a yearlong refurbishing at the Boeing Co. facilities in
California.

YOSEMITE SUSPECT TELLS REPORTER HE WILL PLEAD GUILTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs 13th graf for insert concerning other investigations;
adds new last graf concerning statement by Stayner family.) (lh) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ He said he had dreamed of killing women for 30
years before he found his moment this February, when a middle-aged
woman and two teen-agers on a sightseeing trip to Yosemite National
Park happened to take a room at the motel where he worked as a
janitor.
</P>
<P>
   He killed all three women, Cary Stayner told a television
reporter on Monday night. Then he laid low, escaping suspicion of
the FBI when he was interviewed later in February by its agents,
who then focused on a group of ex-convicts as suspects.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, he said, he could no longer resist the temptation
to kill again, and he decapitated a 26-year-old Yosemite
naturalist, Joie Ruth Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   In a 25-minute jailhouse interview in Sacramento only hours
after he was charged in federal court there with the murder of Ms.
Armstrong, Stayner told the reporter, Ted Rowlands of KBWB-TV in
San Francisco, that he had fantasized since childhood about
murdering women and had killed these four ``because they were at
the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview was conducted off-camera and reported Monday on
the late news. In it, Rowlands reported that Stayner said he
planned to plead guilty to the Armstrong killing when he is
arraigned in Fresno on Aug. 6 and that he also wanted to plead
guilty to the other killings, with which he has not yet been
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands said Stayner, a 37-year-old janitor at the Cedar Lodge
in El Portal, on Yosemite's western edge, had given a detailed
account of how he had killed Carole Sund, 42, her daughter Juli
Sund, 15, and their friend Silvina Pelosso, 16. Their disappearance
from the Cedar Lodge on Feb. 15 generated a vast investigation and
national headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner, whose only prior arrest was for marijuana possession,
told Rowlands that he had tricked the three women into letting him
into their room and had then held them at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had strangled Carole Sund and Ms. Pelosso there, put
their bodies into the trunk of their rental car and then made Juli
Sund drive with him as he searched for a place to kill her and dump
the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, he said, he killed Juli Sund, by slashing her
throat so fiercely that he nearly severed her head, and dumped her
body near a creek. He then left the rental car, with two bodies
still in the trunk, at the remote community of Long Barn, a
two-and-a-half-hour drive east of El Portal, and took a taxi and a
bus back home.
</P>
<P>
   He did not sexually abuse any of his victims, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, he said, he returned _ not only to burn the car
but also to retrieve Mrs. Sund's wallet, which he used to throw the
FBI off his track by dumping it off a highway in Modesto, about
midway between El Portal and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic worked. When Mrs. Sund's wallet was found in Modesto,
both the FBI and local law-enforcement officials set up command
centers at a local hotel and began focusing on suspects in the
Modesto area. Several men with long criminal records have been held
in connection with the case for months, and a federal grand jury
has been hearing testimony since April from associates of those in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, when it announced that Stayner had been arrested
in the decapitation of Ms. Armstrong and was now ``the prime
suspect'' in the February slayings, the FBI had maintained that all
the people involved in those earlier killings were in custody,
albeit on unrelated charges. Now, in light of his confession,
several police departments in counties he has frequented say they
are re-examining some of their unsolved murders.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the television interview, two previously reported
FBI affidavits say that Stayner has confessed in detail to all four
killings, describing facts about the crimes that only someone
involved could have known.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Stayner also told of involvement of a
different kind. At the time Juli Sund's body was found, six days
after the discovery of the two other victims, the authorities said
only that they had been led to the body by a tip. Stayner said on
Monday night that the tip had come from him, in a letter he had
written the FBI telling agents where to look for the body. He had
someone else, unaware of his spree of killing, lick the envelope
for him so that his DNA could not be traced, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, an FBI spokesman, Nick Rossi, declined to comment on
the affidavits and refused to confirm or deny any statements
Stayner ``may have made.''
</P>
<P>
   Stayner's arrest, and confession, has brought new scrutiny to
the investigation of the case. James M. Maddock, who is in charge
of the FBI's Sacramento office, said that the agency will be
examining what, if anything, might have been done differently.
</P>
<P>
   In his confessions, both as described in the affidavits and by
the television station, Stayner said he took pains to throw
officials off by wetting towels in the women's room in the Cedar
Lodge to make it seem as if they had been there the day after he
had killed them.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner's family, was the victim of a terrible crime when he was
11. Stayner's younger brother, Steven, was kidnapped in their
hometown of Merced, and was held for seven years by a sexual
molester. When his abductor showed up one day with a new victim,
Steven and the younger boy escaped. Eight years later, in 1989, at
age 24, Steven was killed in a motorcycle crash.
</P>
<P>
   Reports by local news organizations have been filled with
speculation that Steven's ordeal may somehow have led his brother
to perpetrate violence against women. But in the interview, Stayner
said that he had fantasized about killing women since he was 7,
years before his brother was kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Stayner's father, Delbert Stayner, said that he
still could not believe that his son had committed the murders.
``Maybe someone threatened him into confessing,'' he said in a
brief telephone interview, his voice breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Later the Stayners issued a statement thanking the public for
the support they received when Steven was kidnapped and asking for
privacy now.

SPORTS COLUMN: BASEBALL'S SILLY SURRENDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The voice on Shea Stadium's public-address system had
a spooky alien squeakiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Join us as we play baseball in the year 2021,'' the voice
announced. ``Your favorite team, the Mercury Mets, will do
intergalactic battle with the Pirates of planet Pittsburgh.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, this was not the next Star Wars movie; this was a
one-night futuristic fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   For the occasion, the Mets wore black Mercury Mets shirts with
silver lettering on the front, silver numbers and names
(vertically) on the back and black caps with the Mercury symbol.
</P>
<P>
   All this was part of Major League Baseball's silly surrender to
the Century 21 realtors' promotion that the Yankees, thankfully,
declined to join along with the Dodgers, the Cubs and four other
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   It was known as ``Turn the Clock Ahead Night'' to 2021, but the
Mercury Mets were hoping to turn the clock back to 1988: the last
time their New York ancestors finished in first place.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mercury Mets had won and the Braves had lost in Atlanta,
the Mets would have hopped into first place in the National League
East by one-half game. But the Mercury Mets lost, 5-1, and the
Braves won. So much for those silver-and-black shirts. You could
almost hear the 36,337 fans grumbling, ``They never shoulda changed
the uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Burn them. Better yet, put them on a spaceship to Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   The silver-and-black shirts, which resembled an Oakland Raiders
tear-away jersey that had been torn away, were really a tribute to
Mercury, the Roman god of merchandise and merchants. Some were
raffled off Tuesday night for Easter Seals and the Mets Foundation.
Even some Mets' players were wondering if they could retain the
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we keeping these?'' Brian McRae asked. ``Do they think
we're just wearing these and giving them back? Not adding them to
our collection?''
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson, who is playing lately as if he would still be
leading off in 2021, watched McRae tuck his shirt into his pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to wear it outside,'' Henderson said. ``The future is,
you got to wear it outside. We'll look like Bozo the Clown out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In their red, gold and black shirts, the Pirates did look like
all those circus clowns that keep hopping out of a Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the futuristic fashion, the video screen showed
Mets players with green faces or space helmets. Henderson appeared
there with long pointed ears and a third eye in the middle of his
forehead. But the Mets' manager, Bobby Valentine, thought the
silver-and-black shirts showed baseball's ``progressive'' thinking.
</P>
<P>
   If this was progress, in 2021 baseball will be in more trouble
than it was after the 1994 strike that canceled that year's World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets already led the big leagues in uniforms anyway _ all
white, all white with pinstripes, black shirts with white pants at
Shea; all gray, black shirts with gray pants on the road. Each with
a variety of caps and a mixture of orange, blue and black
lettering.
</P>
<P>
   But as goofy as Tuesday night's uniforms appeared, don't be
surprised if they're in style in 2021 in the natural evolution of
baseball fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 100 years, as documented in Marc Okkonen's
``Baseball Uniforms of the 20th Century'' (Sterling, 1991), home
whites and road grays with or without pinstripes have been the
standard for most teams. But every so often solid colors intruded.
As long ago as 1901, the Baltimore Orioles' road uniforms were
black with orange trim. The 1963 Kansas City Athletics introduced
green-and-gold shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's tailors always searched for more comfortable fabrics.
Imagine wearing those old baggy wool uniforms in the summer heat of
St. Louis, as the Gas House Gang Cardinals did in 1934, or even
wool-and-orlon uniforms until the lighter double-knits arrived in
the early '70s. In their 1944 night games, the Dodgers wore white
satin at home, blue satin on the road. Last night's shirts were
polyester.
</P>
<P>
   The 1976 White Sox wore shorts, but only for that one season;
the players didn't like them. That was around the time when
stockings virtually vanished as pants drooped longer and longer.
</P>
<P>
   But in 2021, if it comes to a choice between Tuesday night's
fashions and global warming, shorts might get another chance.

AMERICAN GENERAL WHO LED NATO TROOPS TO RETIRE IN APRIL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gen. Wesley K. Clark, who led NATO forces in the
war in Yugoslavia, will step down as commander of the alliance and
be replaced by a high-ranking Air Force officer, White House and
Pentagon officials said on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Clark would leave his post next April and
retire to civilian life. His replacement will be Gen. Joseph W.
Ralston, who was in line to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff two years ago but had to step aside from the Pentagon's most
senior military post because of a blemish in his personal life, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Clark was reported in Wednesday's Washington
Post, which characterized the move as arising from disagreements
that Clark had with the Pentagon over the conduct of the war in
Yugoslavia. Clark was known to favor a tougher stance against
President Slobodan Milosevic's aggression in Kosovo well before the
decision to go to war in late March.
</P>
<P>
   During the 11-week air campaign, Clark also urged the Pentagon
to let him plan for a ground invasion if the bombing did not repel
Serbian forces from Kosovo and end their cruelty toward Albanians
in that province. And during the aerial bombardments, he repeatedly
advocated use of more aircraft and more extensive strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House and Pentagon officials who confirmed Clark's
impending retirement and his replacement by Ralston characterized
the change as a way to encourage Ralston to postpone retirement and
stay in uniform, rather than a maneuver to banish Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clark did a great job,'' the White House official said. ``He
won the war, for God's sake!''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon official offered a similar assessment. ``If this
was in any way dissatisfaction with Clark, he'd be moved out long
before,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Both officials, who said they are familiar with the events that
began to unfold on Tuesday, spoke on condition they not be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   They described the replacement of Clark with Ralston as part of
a series of moves involving high-ranking military officers that
will be announced in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, interviewed by The Washington Post from Brussels,
declined to comment on what he might do next. ``There is a long
time yet to do this job, and I've got to keep my attention on it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House official said Defense Secretary William S. Cohen
wanted to do something ``to keep Joe Ralston in uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   The general, a much-decorated combat pilot who flew more than
100 combat missions in the Vietnam War and has been in the Air
Force for 34 years, seemed about to become chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But it was disclosed that he had had an adulterous affair in the
mid-1980s. While the affair was hardly scandalous by the standards
of sexual escapades that have embarrassed the military in recent
years, it was enough to keep him in the post of vice chairman of
the Joint Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston's term as vice chairman is up in February and, by law,
he would have to land a new military job within 60 days or revert
to a lower rank and retire, the officials explained on Tuesday
night. Therefore, they said, the position that Clark now holds was
the logical step for Ralston, especially since Clark's term has
already been extended.

 &HT;    Gymnastics captain pulls out under cloud of suspicion
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Canada _ There's been another defection from the Pan
American Games.
</P>
<P>
   This time it's an American athlete.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's not about politics, it sure seems to have a lot
to do with pout.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati gymnast Jennie Thompson isn't leaving her country,
but she sure did leave the Pan Am Games Women's Gymnastics Event
Finals Tuesday night at Winnipeg Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The team captain of the U.S. women _ and the one girl here who
seemed to be a certain replacement for the Magnificent Seven who
won team gold and a nation's heart at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996
_ was mysteriously scratched from competition Tuesday after a
last-place finish in the night's opening vault event.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who will be 18 on Thursday, was visibly upset after
that event. She had claimed to be hampered by a bum ankle in recent
days and had it wrapped Tuesday night, but there seemed to be more
to her trouble than that.
</P>
<P>
   As the gymnasts readied for the night's second event _ the
uneven parallel bars on which Thompson was to compete _ Mary Lee
Tracy, the American head coach from Cincinnati, hurried over to
other team personnel and with a shake of the head said: ``I'm
pulling her.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy then walked back to Thompson, who was at the edge of the
Arena floor. An animated conversation followed, cut short when the
team captain then wheeled around and disappeared down the athlete's
tunnel. A woman from the stands came down to the floor, talked
briefly with the coach, and with a shrug, Tracy then returned to
matters at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her ankles been bothering her and she had a bad landing,'' a
visibly disappointed Tracy said later. ``She didn't want to risk it
with all the things we have ahead of us in the coming months. She
left. She wanted to get it looked at _ now.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was unavailable for comment. At first Courtney Caress,
the press officer for the U.S. national team, said Thompson would
talk about what happened in a few minutes. That promise was amended
to after the competition. Finally, Caress said Thompson had to
leave the arena:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more serious than they thought, so she's being
transported back to the athlete's village to be treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Told the explanation sounded fishy, Caress was adamant: ``She
didn't pull out of the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to her teammates, who struggled to a lone bronze medal
on the uneven parallel bars by Morgan White, the waif-like 16-year
old who also trains at Tracy's Cincinnati Gymnastics academy.
Meanwhile Canada cleaned up with six medals, including three gold.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Americans got no Kerri Strug performance, here.
</P>
<P>
   Granted the stakes were not nearly as high as when the gimpy
Strug landed her vault in Atlanta and later was carried to the gold
medal presentation by coach Bela Karolyi. Then again, you've got
different personalities as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Thompson's been known as a temperamental sort with
a ``snapping turtle personality,'' as some put it. She's also been
known to get terribly down on herself.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened, she pulled out of two events Tuesday night.
That's after a subpar outing Saturday night in which the U.S. women
were edged for gold by the Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is still the top gymnastic prospect for the United
States Olympic effort at Sydney in 2000. Then again nothing ever
seems to go quite right for her.
</P>
<P>
   She was ``discovered'' by former Olympic gold medalist Bart
Connor when she was just seven. By age 10, she had become the
youngest U.S. event champion in history, winning the floor exercise
at the 1992 Junior Nationals. A year later she was the Junior
Nationals champion.
</P>
<P>
   But the sport can be grueling for young girls and it was on her.
Over the next few years she bounced back and forth between two of
the nations top coaches, Karolyi and Steve Nunno. Each move meant a
relocation, so from Wichita Falls, Texas, she moved to Houston,
Oklahoma City, back to Houston, back to Oklahoma and finally, two
years ago ended up in Cincinnati with Tracy,
</P>
<P>
   Along the way there were two surgeries that cost her all of
1995. An inflammation of the growth plate on her right heel
required sn operation and two screws to hold the heel to the foot.
Then bone chips had to be removed from her elbow.
</P>
<P>
   More frightening were the brief mental meltdowns. Once in
Houston her dad found her huddled in her bed, refusing to go to
Karolyi's gym. She wanted to leave his autocratic rule and return
to Nunno.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, she squeezed herself under the steering column of
her mom's car, grabbed the steering wheel and refused to budge. She
didn't want to go into the gym. A psychologist had to be called to
the parking lot to convince her to relent.
</P>
<P>
   When you hear stories like this you understand how some people
portray gymnastics as a form of institutionalized child abuse. That
might be a stretch, but the top kids do work 35 to 40 hours a week
in the gym. It's enough, according to 1972 Olympian Nancy Theis
Marshall _ who holds seminars on treatment of young athletes _ to
claim gymnasts receive an average of 1 minutes a sunshine a day. In
an attempt to stunt menstruation and puberty, girls often end up
with eating disorders. In fact, they are 10 times more likely than
the general populace to suffer from anorexia or bulimia. Then there
are the injuries, the pressure and the fact that girls are
considered all but washed up by 17 or 18.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, Thompson still endured and was a favorite
to make the 1996 Olympic team. She faltered at the Trials and
missed out. Still, when the Golden Girls went on a post Olympics
five months tour of the nation, Thompson was the only non-Olympian
invited.
</P>
<P>
   She struck up a friendship with two of the girls _ Jaycie Phelps
and Amanda Borden _ both of whom trained at Tracy's gym. The
Cincinnati coach _ once a Cincinnati Bengals cheerleader _ has
become one of the gymnastic gurus of the nation. She's also said to
be a comforting soul.
</P>
<P>
   That was supposed to spell rebirth for Thompson and the Pan Am
Games were to be her first step back.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, her first step was out the door.

POLICE TO LAUNCH ANTI-GANG PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 and LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Targeting gang violence that took the life of a
16-year-old suburban North Hills boy, police pledged to send more
officers onto the streets, while county officials passed a law that
holds parents responsible for gang activity.
</P>
<P>
   The San Fernando Valley's top police officer, Deputy Chief
Michael Bostic, said Tuesday the LAPD is launching an anti-gang
program next week to add officers and resources to Devonshire
Division, one of two Valley divisions hit by an upswing in
gang-related crimes while overall crime has plunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the gang-detail officers, Metropolitan Division,
undercover narcotics division there. We've got almost every
resource there every day,'' Bostic said. ``We've just got to keep
doing everything we can.''
</P>
<P>
   But even strong police presence cannot guarantee an end to
crime, like the fatal shooting of Giovanni Avelar as he walked home
from Los Angeles-area Monroe High School last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't control the total disregard for the rights of someone
else,'' Bostic said. ``Eventually, the community has to decide that
they've had enough. The parents have to take responsibility for
those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the community is fed up and is willing to work with us,
we can't do it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Los Angeles County supervisors adopted an ordinance
that could send parents to jail for up to six months and fine them
$500 if their minor children commit gang-related crimes and parents
didn't exercise enough control over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a dramatic and stunning resumption of gang
violence in the San Fernando Valley,'' said Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky, whose son attends Monroe High. ``The minute you walk
outside the boundaries of the school you're literally taking your
life into your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors also said they will consider opening an
investigation into the breakdown of a long-standing gang truce, and
they debated an anti-loitering ordinance targeted at gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Although the county's action affects only unincorporated areas
of Los Angeles County, board members said the plague of gang
violence must be stemmed at all corners.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors formally charged Luis Acosta, 18, with Avelar's
death on Tuesday. He was being held in lieu of $1.5 million bail.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they believe that among the reasons for the collapse
of a long-standing gang truce and rise in violence in the Valley is
that young gang members are starting new rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   Acosta has been with the notorious Langdon Street Gang since he
was 10 or 11 and became one of the top leaders, Devonshire
Detective Brad Cochran said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite his age and the other young gang members, they are
just as dangerous or more dangerous than their older
counterparts,'' Cochran said. ``We've got most of the older Langdon
Street guys in jail, but the serious narcotics activity keeps
things alive out there.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 21, Avelar was walking home from school when he was
confronted by two teen-agers who asked if he was affiliated with a
gang. One of those youths is believed to be Acosta.
</P>
<P>
   Avelar said he wasn't a gang member, and one of them began
punching him, police said.
</P>
<P>
   During the fight Acosta allegedly pulled out a handgun and shot
Avelar several times in the upper body.
</P>
<P>
   The accomplice remained at large at press time.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Avelar, a model student from El Salvador who hoped to
help support his family, is the ``epitome'' case of an innocent
victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, the entire incident was just about turf,''
Cochran said. ``There was no other reason except they didn't think
he belonged there. It's just tragic, but everything is driven by
narcotics.''
</P>
<P>
   His death comes as a gang truce in place since 1993 has
crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich said he will introduce a motion
next week calling for an investigation into the unravelling of the
gang truce brokered in 1993 by a county agency.
</P>
<P>
   Antonovich's proposal was prompted by a Los Angeles Daily News
report Sunday that gang-related crime has risen in the Valley as
the truce has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Daily News analysis of police statistics, crime
attributed to gangs was up 3.65 percent in the Valley for the first
six months of 1999, compared to the same period in 1998. At the
same time, serious crime _ including gang-related offenses _ was
down 10 percent overall in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the troubling statistics, the LAPD planned to implement
the Community Law Enforcement and Recovery, CLEAR, program in the
Devonshire Division.
</P>
<P>
   The program, conceived in 1995 in the wake of the slaying of
3-year-old Stephanie Kuehn in the Cypress Park area of Los Angeles,
gives officers quick access to records and suspends the probable
cause requirement for searches of homes of probation violation
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   And, once in place, CLEAR will add more officers to the area,
which already is receiving extra attention, Bostic said.
</P>
<P>
   Enraged about the rise in violence in North Hills, members of
the group Familias Unidas plan to hold a news conference to call
for a return to peace and for more youth programs that can serve as
alternatives to gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good people in this community who care
about youth and are determined to promote peace in the face of
adversity,'' said Doris Casteneda, a North Hills parent and
Familias Unidas organizer. ``We know that violence is preventable
and that peace cannot be created through law enforcement efforts
alone.''

SENATORS' DISTASTE FOR CLINTON AND U.N. SANDBAGS HOLBROOKE
NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for two new grafs at end of story with updating remarks by
Lott)  (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's decision to
take a ``second look'' at the nomination of Richard Holbrooke to be
the chief U.S. diplomat to the United Nations appears to have less
to do with Holbrooke's qualifications than with the Senate's low
esteem for both the United Nations and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination has been in limbo for well over a year, stalled
initially by ethical questions about Holbrooke's business dealings
as an investment banker. But now Lott and other senators are
holding the nomination hostage in exchange for various demands on
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate that has developed reflects the anger and distrust
between the Republican-controlled Congress and President Clinton
the year after his impeachment. It also underscores the
unpopularity of the United Nations, both in Congress and among the
public, and the fact that there is little price to pay for turning
down an official whom many senators consider arrogant and whose
job, unlike that of secretary of state, is largely unknown to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Lott ordered his aides last week to conduct yet another review,
even though the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved
Holbrook in June without dissent after four exhaustive hearings.
But the ``second look'' at Holbrooke by the senator's staff, Senate
Republican aides said, had less to do with the nominee's fitness
for the job than with saving face for Republicans who are stalling
a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Lott had placed a ``hold'' on the nomination, in a show
of loyalty to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has sought the
appointment of a conservative to the Federal Election Commission
whom the White House and many congressional Democrats oppose. The
Republicans were attempting an old-fashioned horse trade: Holbrooke
would be confirmed if Bradley Smith, an Ohio law professor, was
appointed to the FEC by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only leverage we have with the administration is the power
to confirm,'' McConnell said in an interview. He said the White
House was trying to usurp a long tradition that permitted
Republicans and Democrats to each pick members of the commission.
But he said that discussions continue with the White House to break
the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Such a prolonged delay of a Cabinet-level appointee is rare,
particularly when the reasons are largely unrelated to the nominee
himself. The Senate's historian, Richard Baker, said in an
interview that he could not recall a case like Holbrooke's in the
past quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unprecedented in the way they've beaten this around,''
said G. Calvin Mackenzie, a professor of government at Colby
College. ``The appointment process has become an opportunity for a
Senate controlled by one party to get leverage on a president of
another party.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lott and McConnell, two other senators also have
holds on the nomination. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, wants to
protect a woman he thinks was a whistle-blower at the U.S. mission
at the United Nations. And Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, is wary
of Holbrooke's role in the administration's Balkan policymaking.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet appointees have, of course, been defeated. The Senate
rejected President George Bush's nomination of former Sen. John
Tower, R-Texas, to be defense secretary in 1989. Since 1801,
however, only 18 Cabinet-level nominations have been rejected or
not confirmed for other reasons, according to the Senate Historical
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Even Lott says Holbrooke will be confirmed eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate rules, any lawmaker can delay a final vote on
legislation or a nomination indefinitely, usually to force an
administration to accept something, or someone, it would not
otherwise approve. But Senators typically exercise this prerogative
on middle-level appointments, like ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Senate tradition of holding presidential
nominations hostage for other ends, but what's unique is this one
is at the level of the U.N. ambassador,'' said Marshall Wittmann,
director of congressional relations for the conservative Heritage
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Cabinet-level nominees are created equal. When Sen.
James Inhofe, R-Okla., threatened in June to block all presidential
nominations, including that of Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers to be Treasury secretary, the world financial markets
briefly quaked. Senate leaders and Clinton quickly worked out a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In this Senate, Washington's envoy to the United Nations does
not command that respect, many scholars said. The Cabinet-level
status for the U.S. delegate to the United Nations has been
conferred by Clinton, but it is not automatic, as with other
Cabinet posts. The United States has been without a permanent
representative to the United Nations since last September, when
Bill Richardson left the position to become secretary of energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blocking the nominee to the U.N. is a good way for Senate
Republicans to frustrate the Clinton administration without drawing
a great backlash,'' said John Pitney, a political science professor
at Claremont McKenna College. ``Plus, a vast number of Americans
have no idea who Richard Holbrooke is.''
</P>
<P>
   His nomination was held up most of the last year as a result of
federal ethics investigations that ended without any criminal
charges. The Foreign Relations Committee approved Holbrooke only
after the administration agreed to endorse reductions in the U.S.
assessments to the United Nations, championed by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., the committee's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the panel's approval, however, the four Senate
Republicans moved to block a final vote by the full Senate. Lott's
commitment to his cause came under scrutiny two weeks ago when Tim
Russert, the host of NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' asked the senator
about Smith. Looking surprised, Lott replied, ``Bradley Smith? Now,
let's see. That sounds familiar. Who is Bradley Smith?''
</P>
<P>
   Only after a little coaching from Russert did Lott recall the
connection. The senator's spokesman, John Czwartacki, who refused
to confirm that Lott had put a hold on the nomination, dismissed
the exchange over Smith and the review of Holbrooke's record as ``a
tempest in a teapot.''
</P>
<P>
   The delays have angered Senate Democrats, and now even some
influential Republicans are growing weary of the stalling. Sen.
John Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed Services Committee, and
Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., a member of the Foreign Relations
Committee, have demanded a quick vote on Holbrooke to fill an
important U.S. foreign policy job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holbrooke issue is a clear example of how bipartisan
foreign policy and national security have frayed to the point where
no cloth is left,'' Hagel said in an interview. ``This kind of
conspiratorial, back room nonsense is holding Holbrooke hostage.
America's interests in the world are being held captive by a small
partisan band.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Tuesday night on the CNN program ``Late
Edition,'' Lott predicted that Holbrooke would be confirmed for the
position, but he declined to predict when the vote might be held.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, I expect there will be a vote on his
nomination,'' Lott said. ``I think it will have some votes against
it, but I think it would be unlikely it would be defeated.''

   The umpires' strategy to induce Major League Baseball to come to
the bargaining table began to unravel as soon as some of the
umpires returned home from the union meeting two weeks ago and
began talking to their wives and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we drank the Kool-Aid and had ether shot into the
room,'' one umpire said Tuesday, discussing the July 14 meeting in
Philadelphia. ``I got home that night and told my wife what we had
done and she said, `Don't you think you should have a cooling off
period and talk it over with your family?' So simplistic and so
true.''
</P>
<P>
   The umpire, who spoke on the condition he not be identified,
said his wife's reaction had punctured the high on which he was
still operating after returning home from the charged meeting,
where more than 50 umpires signed letters of resignation, effective
Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I came out out of the ether, I sat on the edge of the
bed and said, `What the heck have I just done?''' the umpire
recounted in a telephone interview. ``After giving it some thought,
I was one of the first guys to rescind. Not that I fear anything,
but I started looking at what happens if they accept the
resignations. There's not a lot I could do to make this kind of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Other umpires said they had consulted their lawyers after
returning home, and the lawyers reacted even more severely than the
umpire's wife did, telling them they had left themselves open to
the loss of their jobs. If they were going out on strike, which
their labor contract prohibits them from doing, they would
eventually reach a settlement with Major League Baseball and return
to work. Once the umpires submitted their resignations, however,
the leagues were free to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen umpires who had signed letters of resignation
subsequently rescinded their action, joining eight who had never
signed.
</P>
<P>
   That left 42 umpires _ nine in the American League, 33 in the
National _ who withdrew their resignations Tuesday after their
union leader and lawyer, Richard Phillips, failed to win the first
round of the union's lawsuit in U.S. District Court in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires who held to their resignations until Tuesday
resented those who abandoned the strategy. The refusal of those
umpires to go along with the strategy was basically a repudiation
of Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to me if I like Richie Phillips as a person
or not,'' Jerry Meals, a third-year member of the NL staff, said in
a telephone interview Tuesday. ``We as a union voted to retain
Richie Phillips for our counsel for the next five years back in
February. That is how we voted as a union and that is how the union
should stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Marsh, an 18-year NL umpire, said at Shea Stadium Tuesday
night that he believed baseball officials would have ``paid more
attention to us'' if the umpires had held together.
</P>
<P>
   The division in the union has created hardships for the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Froemming, a member of the union's board of directors,
heads a crew that has Mark Hirschbeck, the only NL umpire who did
not resign, and Wally Bell and Jeff Nelson, the two who withdrew
their resignations. ``I think it's difficult for everybody,''
Froemming said by telephone from Atlanta. ``It's a big hurt because
I've treated two of these guys like my best friends and almost like
my son and I feel they've turned their backs on me. Jeff just came
on, but I've known Wally and Mark for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The other three, Froemming said, had told him that they thought
he was making a mistake, ``that I will be unemployed and they'll be
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy has become routine in the locker room, the veteran
umpire added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not an open group anymore,'' he said. ``They have
complicated it. This is about individuals thinking they can do
better for themselves. They're not thinking as a group.''

SHOULD ARIZONA DROP FUEL REQUIRE MENTS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL AND THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona should drop its requirement that summertime fuel in the
metro area contain the controversial additive MTBE, a top state
air-quality official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That echoes the findings of a national panel, which is backing
away from the air-quality benefits of the additive because it's
been found to pollute water supplies and may cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona groundwater has been tainted by MTBE, but the
drinking-water supply is safe, say officials at the Arizona
Department of Environmental Quality and various municipal water
departments.
</P>
<P>
   DEQ has not received reports of tainted drinking water, agency
officials said Tuesday. MTBE has a distinct odor and taste that
likely would compel people to report it, something that has not
happened, said DEQ spokeswoman Amy Rezzonico.
</P>
<P>
   And representatives of various Valley water departments said
their routine tests for contaminants have not detected MTBE in
drinking-water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale found trace amount of MTBE at one well, but the
levels were well below health standards, said Barbara Olivieri, the
city's water quality director.
</P>
<P>
   Although drinking water is turning up clean, DEQ already has
documented cases of MTBE contamination in the groundwater around
underground gas-storage tanks in both urban and rural Arizona. In
random samples at 13 underground sites that it monitors, DEQ found
several cases where MTBE concentrations were hundreds of times
higher than the health-based guidance level it uses for drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
   DEQ does not routinely check for MTBE contamination in Arizona
water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But because of concerns raised in California and other parts of
the U.S., Arizona has been re-examining its dependence on MTBE, or
methyl tertiary butyl ether.
</P>
<P>
   The state won't have a specific course of action until the DEQ
completes a draft `action plan'' on the fuel additive next month.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull is also waiting on the report, due Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see what they come up with,'' said Hull's
spokeswoman, Francie Noyes. ``We need to have our facts straight
before we decide to go in one direction or another. But this is
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Noyes said the governor wants to maintain the air-quality gains
that the metro area has made with cleaner-burning fuels, but must
be attentive to unintended problems, such as water pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Domsky said it's likely that the state could parallel the
recommendations of the federal blue-ribbon panel. That group on
Tuesday recommended to the Environmental Protection Agency that the
use of MTBE be ``reduced substantially'' because, while it cleans
the air by making gasoline burn more cleanly, it can leak into
water supplies and pollute the water.
</P>
<P>
   California in March took the first step, vowing to phase out
MTBE by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could move in tandem with the rest of the
country,'' Domsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than requiring a specific oxygenate to make gasoline burn
cleaner, perhaps Arizona should simply set a performance standard,
Domsky said. It would be up to the oil companies to produce a fuel
that would meet that standard.
</P>
<P>
   At least one fuel company, Tosco, has already produced a
clean-burning gasoline that does not rely upon MTBE. In testimony
to the DEQ last March, Tosco said Arizona can get a clean-burning
gasoline without MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has been using MTBE in its gasoline since 1989, when it
was introduced to cut emissions during the winter. However, ethanol
has replaced MTBE as the wintertime oxygenate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, then-Gov. Fife Symington signed Maricopa County up for
the federal program that the blue-ribbon panel has scrutinized. He
said the clean-air benefits of MTBE would help Arizona aggressively
tackle ozone pollution, which plagues the Valley in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   A draft DEQ report in March detailed 13 locations where MTBE was
found in groundwater, and concluded that ``MTBE may well occur in
groundwater located near fuel-release sites throughout Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   DEQ drew samples from four sites in Mesa, although DEQ could not
determine their exact locations Tuesday. In all four cases, MTBE
concentrations were far in excess of the 35 parts per billion that
DEQ considers it health-based guidance level. The EPA recommends 20
to 40 ppb as a drinking-water standard, to ensure water has a
generally acceptable taste and odor.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Rusty Bowers, R-Mesa, said he doesn't see MTBE as an
``imminent threat'' and said the state should balance clean air and
clean water concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally would just as soon get rid of it, now,'' Bowers
said.
</P>
<P>
   That offers little solace to people such as Bob Jacobs, a Valley
real-estate appraiser who has warned against MTBE's health effects
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, he said, turned a deaf ear to his concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing could have been stopped,'' he said. Now, he
predicts, Valley motorists will have to pay higher prices at the
pump as oil companies try to recoup their investment in idled MTBE
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see people really outraged,'' he said,
envisioning prices upward of $1.50 a gallon. &QL;

PIRATES BEAT METS, 5-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The promotion was billed as Turn Ahead the Clock
Night. But it was the kind of future the New York Mets could live
without.
</P>
<P>
   If Tuesday night was any indication for the Pittsburgh Pirates,
however, the coming years will belong to their 24-year-old rookie
right-hander, Kris Benson, who pitched the first complete game of
his major league career.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, the No.1 pick over all in the 1996 draft out of Clemson
University, throttled the Mets throughout a 5-1 victory. He
received a little help from two home runs from Al Martin and a moon
shot from Brant Brown that bounced off the scoreboard in right
field.
</P>
<P>
   Benson (8-8) allowed one run (a homer by Robin Ventura leading
off the seventh inning) and six hits to halt the Mets' winning
streak at six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had command of all three of his pitches,'' said Orel
Hershiser, who was outpitched by Benson. ``If you command one, you
can pitch here. If you command two, you can be tough. And if you
command three, you can be dominant.''
</P>
<P>
   With a fastball in the 94- to 95-mile-an-hour range and a
hard-breaking curveball, Benson was indeed dominant.
</P>
<P>
   The six-game winning streak had tied the longest this season by
the Mets, who are still 33-14 since June 6. But Tuesday night's
loss, coupled with the Braves' 10-2 victory over Milwaukee, dropped
the Mets (60-42) a game and a half behind the first-place Braves in
the National League East.
</P>
<P>
   As for the promotion, which envisioned uniforms as they might be
in 2021, it might have been a success from a box-office standpoint:
the crowd of 36,337 was outstanding for a Tuesday night. But it's
likely the Mets will not want to wear the uniforms again.
</P>
<P>
   The black and silver threads looked like a cross between
softball uniforms and something a 1980s band would wear on stage.
The Pirates' red and yellow jerseys weren't much better, leading
one to hope to get more out of the fashion world in the next 22
years.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser kept the Mets in the game _ he allowed seven hits and
four runs in six and a third innings _ but these promotions have
not been kind to him at all. Hershiser lost on Turn Back the Clock
Day in Tampa, Fla., on July 17. As he said earlier this week, ``How
come both times we wear the odd uniforms, I get to pitch?''
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson, who like Hershiser is 40, did not mind the
uniforms _ he sported his without sleeves _ as much as the picture
of him on the scoreboard for each of his at-bats. Manager Bobby
Valentine had called the promotions department creative.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the word Henderson would have chosen. When he
came to bat in the first inning, the home-plate umpire, Angel
Hernandez, pointed out the futuristic scoreboard shot to Henderson:
it featured him with a third eye in the middle of his forehead,
huge ears and a bald conical head.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson could not believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny?'' he said. ``Mine was funny enough. I don't know where
they came up with my picture. I know my ears ain't that big. Before
the game started, the umpires were laughing at me. And then when I
lined out to short'' _Abraham Nunez had to leap for the ball _
``they were saying I hit the guy in his third eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was laughing so hard behind the plate, he had to close
his eyes. Said the third-base umpire, Joe West, ``I told Rickey
that was the best he's ever looked.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets trailing, 1-0, in the third inning, Mike Piazza
came to the plate during the Mets' best threat of the night, the
bases loaded with two outs. But Benson surprised Piazza with a
sinker down and in, and Piazza grounded to third for a fielder's
choice. Benson basically cruised from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad swing,'' Piazza said. ``I wish I could have it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful the Mets feel the same about Turn Ahead the Clock
Night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have had a big top,'' Hershiser said. ``If we can't
sell the product the way it is, maybe we should give it a rest.''
