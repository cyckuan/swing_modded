	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ When she left for the United States a
year ago, Se Ri Pak was just a promising golf rookie, little known
even in her homeland.
	   On Tuesday, Pak returned home as a national heroine, probably
the biggest sports sensation South Korea has ever had. Awaiting her
were a government medal and a dinner with the prime minister.
	   ``I am satisfied with my debut year. I really thank fans at home
for their enthusiastic support,'' Pak said with a broad smile
during a brief news conference at the airport.
	   Pak's meteoric rise in the LPGA was the best news South Korea
has had in a year of deep economic trouble. She also stirred
unprecedented public interest in the sport in a country where most
people wouldn't know a birdie from a bogey.
	   The 20-year-old South Korean won the LPGA Championship in May.
She won the U.S. Women's Open a month later, broke the LPGA scoring
record with a 61 in winning the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic and then
rallied to beat Dottie Pepper down the stretch at the Giant Eagle
LPGA Classic two weeks later.
	   Hers was the best rookie season since Nancy Lopez.
	   President Kim Dae-jung planned to award Pak the Order of Sport
Merit Maengho (Brave Tiger) Medal next Monday. It is the second
highest honor the government can confer to an athlete.
	   Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil, an avid golf fan, was to host a
dinner for Pak later Tuesday.
	   Pak's feat even surprised her corporate sponsor, Samsung, which
first saw her extraordinary potential, paid for her to move to
Florida and train under David Leadbetter.
	   ``We had hoped she would win one tournament by the end of the
season. Four victories! It's quite a surprise. We will spare no
efforts to assist her in the future,'' said Samsung executive Won
Dae-yon.
	   Pak will play in a non-tour event in her honor this week before
heading to Japan for the Japan Classic, the next-to-last official
LPGA event, where she will try to cut into her 40-point deficit
with Anika Sorenstam for LPGA Player of the Year.
	   Pak has not won a tournament since July.
	   To South Korean fans and TV stations yearning for weeks for a
new victory, Pak said she was not hurrying.
	   ``I had a tough march this year since this is my debut year. It
somewhat strained my stamina,'' Pak said when asked whether she
played too many tournaments this season.
	   ``Next year, I will have a more relaxing season schedule and
have a better record. I will need more time to become an even
better player,'' she said.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ People fled their coastal homes and
the Honduran government sent air force planes to pluck residents
off remote Caribbean islands in the face of the most powerful
hurricane in a decade to threaten Central America.
	   Hurricane Mitch became a Category 5 hurricane on Monday, with
winds of 180 mph (285 kph). At 10 p.m. EST (0300 GMT Tuesday),
Mitch was centered just west of Honduras' Swan Islands and was
moving west-northwest at 8 mph (13 kph).
	   It was expected to continue on that path, though at a slower
pace, on Tuesday. Forecasters said the hurricane might veer
somewhat to the north and lose a little force before hitting land.
	   The Hurricane Center said as much as 15 inches (38 cms) of rain
was possible in parts of Central America, combined with battering
waves along the coast.
	   ``Some fluctuations in strength are possible ... but Mitch is
expected to remain a very dangerous hurricane capable of causing
catastrophic damage,'' the U.S. National Weather Service said in a
statement from its National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   Jerry Jarrell, the center's director, said Mitch was the
strongest hurricane to strike the Caribbean since Gilbert in 1988.
	   Thousands of people abandoned or were evacuated from coastal
regions of Honduras, Belize, Mexico and Cuba on Monday as the
hurricane marched across the Swan Islands, about 100 miles (160
kilometers) north of the Honduran mainland.
	   Hurricane Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States,
forecasters said. The storm was expected to remain in the northwest
Caribbean for the next five days, the center said.
	   Belize and Honduras closed almost all public schools and offices
along the Caribbean coast until further notice. Mexico said it was
mobilizing troops and massing relief supplies along the eastern
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. Cuba said it had evacuated 600
vacationers from the Island of Youth.
	   In Belize, panic buying stripped bread from the shelves of some
stores and some gasoline stations ran dry. Coastal Belize City was
hit so hard by Hurricane Hattie in 1961 that the country built a
new capital inland at Belmopan.
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of
alert and told coastal residents to leave their homes for safer
ground farther inland.
	   ``Where can I go if I leave my house? The government hasn't
opened a single shelter,'' asked Pedro Martinez, an electrician in
the northern city of San Pedro Sula, 100 miles (180 kms) north of
the capital, Tegucigalpa.
	   San Pedro Sula's mayor and the Red Cross said they might set up
shelters in public schools.
	   In La Ceiba, on Honduras' western coast, people stood in long
lines at filling stations to buy gasoline under a steady rain.
	   Maria Gonzalez said she needed the gas to cook with in case her
firewood gets wet. She bought only 5 lempiras (37 cents) worth,
saying it was all she could afford.
	   ``I have six children, and we live in a riverbed,'' she said.
``If it gets real bad, we'll go to the church and see what the
architect of the world has in store for us.''
	   The president ordered all air force planes and helicopters to
evacuate people from the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small
islands off the coast of central Honduras.
	   Swinwick Jackson, a fisherman on one of the islands, said he had
tied up his boats and was planning to take his family to stay with
a relative on higher ground. Speaking by telephone from Utila, 20
miles (35 kms) north of La Ceiba, he said most tourists had left
the island Sunday but that some were stranded and that hotels were
moving them to houses in the mountains.
	   ``Mitch is closing in, and God help us in the coming hours,''
said Utila Mayor Monterrey Cardenas.
	   Police spokesman Ivan Mejia said the Coco, Segovia and Cruta
rivers all overflowed their banks Monday along the eastern Honduran
coast. ``Frightened people are moving into the mountains to search
for shelter,'' he said.
	   In El Progreso, 100 miles (180 kms) north of Tegucigalpa, the
army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana
plantations along the Ulua River, said Nolly Soliman, a resident of
the town.
	   Before bearing down on Honduras, Mitch swept past Jamaica and
the Cayman Islands. Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican
capital, Kingston, and government offices and schools closed in the
Caymans, a British colony of 28,000 people.
	   Forecasters said they don't expect Mitch to be a Category 5
hurricane by the time it makes landfall.
	   ``We do forecast it to decrease in strength over the next 72
hours,'' said Jeremy Pennington a meteorologist at the National
Hurricane Center.
	   That didn't stop Flores Facusse from ordering the closure of all
public offices on the Caribbean coast by noon Monday. He also
canceled classes at all schools there, and health officials sent
medicine to public hospitals.
	   ``We're ready for whatever situation occurs,'' said
Vice-President Billy Handal. ``I ask God to be benevolent with
Hondurans.''
	   The strongest hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory was
Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras' Caribbean coast, killing at
least 2,000 people.

Sides meet at secret site; talk about compromise economic system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with last participants leaving &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The opposing sides in the NBA lockout met for
nine hours and finally started talking in detail about a
compromise, making it the most productive negotiating session
they've had to date.
	   ``There's hope,'' Dikembe Mutombo of the Atlanta Hawks said late
Monday.
	   One participant said the league backed off somewhat on its
demand for a hard salary cap, meaning the sides have to be closer,
at least in principle, to coming to an agreement on the main
economic issues.
	   ``The best thing is we have some sort of an agreement on basic
principles,'' said Orlando center Danny Schayes, a member of the
union's executive committee.
	   ``Right now we're talking about a hybrid system. The first
couple of years it would work one way, for another couple of years
it would work another way if the first way didn't work. At least
we're finding some common ground,'' Schayes said.
	   About 20 people from the union and 10 from the league worked
through the afternoon and into the night at a luxury Manhattan
hotel. The site was kept a secret to avoid the circus atmosphere
that has surrounded past negotiating sessions.
	   Most participants left after about 7 1/2 hours, but a few
members from each side, including commissioner David Stern and
union director Billy Hunter, continued until 0400 GMT.
	   Despite the stealthiness and the reluctance of most of the
principals to discuss details, it was eminently clear that the
sides were moving away from confrontation and toward compromise.
	   The league was asking to operate under a luxury tax system for
the next three seasons, with a fallback system of a harder salary
cap for the next three years. The union was asking for a tax system
lasting two years, with the fallback system lasting another two
years, Schayes said.
	   Still, the sides had not made any movement on whose contracts
would be taxable and how high the tax would be. In earlier
bargaining sessions, the union proposed a 50 percent tax on the
amount of any annual salary exceeding dlrs 18 million, and the
owners proposed a tax of anywhere from 50 to 200 percent on any
contract signed under the Larry Bird exception for more than dlrs
2.6 million annually.
	   ``The good news is at least we're talking about the same
thing,'' Schayes said. ``We're not close on the specifics, so it
depends what you call progress. There's nothing that would signal
any imminent announcements, but we've agreed to talk more.''
	   The sides have agreed to meet throughout the week.
	   Stern, deputy commissioner Russ Granik, Hunter and union
president Patrick Ewing met for about three hours Saturday to
conclude a contentious week that included arbitrator John Feerick's
decision on owners' liability for guaranteed contracts and the
union's militant meeting in Las Vegas.
	   The league did not immediately comment.
	   Monday's talks _ the seventh joint session _ came in advance of
a two-day meeting of the league's Board of Governors. It was
Stern's best chance to make a bold move toward settling a dispute
that has lasted nearly four months and has forced the league to
cancel games for the first time in its history.
	   On Wednesday, the full board is expected to meet with dozens,
perhaps hundreds, of players. Plans for such an assembly are
incomplete, but both sides have talked as if they expected such a
meeting to take place.
	   If the sides can come up with a compromise number at which the
luxury tax would kick in, they would effectively set a sort of
maximum salary. That would leave more money for the middle class of
players that was shrinking under the old labor agreement.
	   In their previous proposal, the owners insisted upon having a
hard salary cap as a fallback in case a tax system failed to reduce
the amount of basketball-related income devoted to player salaries.
	   Under that fallback proposal, each player would have a
percentage of his salary deducted from his paycheck and put into an
escrow account. At the end of the season, if the amount of revenue
devoted to salaries had not dropped to 52 percent, enough of that
escrow money would be returned to the owners to hit the targeted
percentages _ 52 percent in the 2000-01 season, 50 percent in
2001-02 and 48 percent in 2002-03.
	   Barring a quick settlement, the rest of the November schedule _
and probably some December games _ will be canceled this week. So
far, only the first two weeks of the season have been scrapped.

Report: Hollywood film to be shot on Thai isle despite protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Despite an outcry from
conservationists, a key official has given Hollywood the green
light to shoot a film starring ``Titanic'' star Leonardo DiCaprio
inside a national park, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The 20th Century Fox film, ``The Beach,'' is to be partly shot
on Phi Phi Island in southern Thailand. Critics have said the
filming and an increase in tourism would degrade the island's
environment.
	   The Nation daily quoted Royal Forestry Department
Director-General Plodprasob Suraswadi as saying the producers would
deposit 5 million baht (dlrs 132,000) to offset any environmental
damage and also make contributions to support the park's
management.
	   Plodprasob said he had received many letters, from Thais and
foreigners, urging approval of the shooting.
	   ``All activities of the film crew will be under the control of
forestry officials,'' he said, adding that the minister of
agriculture must give final approval before filming can start in
January.
	   Once an idyllic island inhabited by a small fishing community,
Phi Phi has been turned into a major tourist destination.
	   Much of its fringing coral has been destroyed and construction
of hotels and other tourist facilities has mushroomed despite
regulations prohibiting such activity inside national parks.

Pittsburgh Penguins beat Maple Leafs 2-0

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Robert Lang and Jaromir Jagr scored power-play
goals and Peter Skudra got his first career shutout as the
Pittsburgh Penguins beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 2-0 Monday night.
	   Skudra, a last-minute starter after Tom Barrasso reinjured his
groin during warmups, was sensational. He stopped 26 shots,
including clutch saves on Mats Sundin, Sergei Berezin and Mike
Johnson in the third period.
	   The shutout was Skudra's first in 21 NHL games.
	   At one point in the second period, it appeared Skruda wouldn't
be able to finish the game. Penguins defenseman Neil Wilkinson
inadvertently bowled into Skudra while trying to check Toronto's
Alyn McCauley, and the goalie lay motionless on the ice for two
minutes. He got up, however, and stayed in the game.
	   The Leafs were 0-for-8 on the power play and are now 4-for-45 on
the season, third-worst in the league.
 &UR; Coyotes 5, Avalanche 1 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Keith Tkachuk had two goals and an assist as the
Phoenix Coyotes beat the Colorado Avalanche for the second time
this season.
	   Cliff Ronning and Rick Tocchet each had a goal and an assist for
the Coyotes, who won for the first time in Denver since March 27,
1996.
	   Jimmy Waite made 19 saves in his first start of the year. He was
denied his fourth career shutout when Keith Jones scored for
Colorado at 16:39 of the third period. The Avalanche had two goals
disallowed because of crease violations.
	   Colorado was 1-for-7 on the power play, but avoided being shut
out for the third time this year.

Boats collide, 60 feared dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ Two boats carrying worshippers who had
just completed an early morning river ritual collided in
northeastern India Tuesday, leaving at least 60 people missing and
feared dead, police and survivors said.
	   Sri Kant Jha, 26, was one of ten people who swam to safety after
their boat carrying 70 people sank after hitting another boat head
on in Gauhati, the Assamese state capital of Gauhati, 2,100
kilometers (1,300 miles), east of New Delhi. The other boat,
carrying 20 people, was undamaged.
	   Jha said he heard a loud thud and before he knew what was
happening, he was in the water. He said five of his relatives were
missing.
	   Both boats had been hired by pilgrims from the neighboring state
of Bihar for an annual Hindu ritual involving scattering flowers
and floating oil lamps on the Brahmaputra river, considered holy,
before dawn. The pilgrims on the two boats knew each other, Jha
said.
	   The cause of the accident was not immediately clear.

Report: Police to seize children at anti-government rallies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police warned parents not to bring
their children to anti-government protests or risk losing custody
under child welfare laws, a news report said Tuesday.
	   After chaos and violence erupted at a huge street protest over
the weekend, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad accused rioters of
using women and children as ``shields'' for protection against
police.
	   Yaacub Amin, head of the police department's Criminal
Investigation Department, said the tactic, if true, was illegal.
Citing the Child Protection Act, he said police at upcoming rallies
would not hesitate to seize children temporarily to ``protect''
them from their own parents.
	   ``There has been one too many cases where parents had brought
their children for illegal gatherings,'' Yaacub was quoted as
saying in the New Straits Times newspaper. ``This cannot go on, and
we have to put a stop to it right now.''
	   In weekly Saturday gatherings, thousands have taken to the
streets of a downtown Kuala Lumpur shopping district to demand
justice for jailed dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim and an end to
Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   A full-scale riot broke out for the first time in nearly three
decades over the weekend, where riot police fired tear gas and
water cannons at protesters inside a mosque, who retaliated by
hurling stones and bricks.
	   Police have banned anti-government rallies but the crowds have
turned out defiantly, drawing a wider cross-section of Malaysians,
including businessmen, civil servants, students and housewives with
children.
	   Before firing tear gas and water cannons, laced with a stinging
chemical, police have warned women and children to leave the area.
	   Malaysia's leading human rights group, SUARAM, which has been
monitoring the rallies, said it had seen no sign of parents using
their children as protection.
	   ``I think the accusation is extremely unfounded,'' said
Elizabeth Wong, a SUARAM spokesperson. ``This is a way for the
government not to get parents to come to demonstrations at all.''
	   Anti-government demonstrations were mostly unheard of in usually
docile Malaysia until Mahathir fired Anwar as deputy prime minister
and finance minister on Sept. 2.
	   Anwar was later arrested for leading protests, and now faces
trial starting Nov. 2 on 10 counts of homosexual practices and
corruption.
	   Yaacub said police on patrol at demonstrations would exercise
their authority to judge whether a child was being exploited.
	   ``If our investigations reveal that parents had blatantly
brought their children to a riot for use as shields against police
action, we will place the children in the custody of welfare
homes,'' Yaacub said.
	   The government, increasingly worried by the swelling dissent,
has warned the public of laws limiting political activity. Under
existing laws, students can be expelled and civil servants fired
for rallying against the government. Taxi drivers have been warned
not to discuss politics with passengers.

Japanese leader wants new economic stimulus package by Nov. 16
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi instructed his
Cabinet on Tuesday to work toward compiling a new package of
government spending designed to boost Japan's sagging economy, a
spokesman said.
	   The Cabinet will meet next week to review proposed stimulus
measures and expects to reach a final decision on the scope of the
package by Nov. 16, said a spokesman for the prime minister's
office, who declined to be named.
	   The move comes in a bid to prevent Japan's economy from
shrinking for a third consecutive year and to fulfill Obuchi's
pledge to engineer a recovery within two years.
	   But many economists say prospects appear slim for a quick
rebound.
	   The latest sign of stagnation came Tuesday when the government
announced the unemployment rate was unchanged at a record 4.3
percent in September even as the overall size of the work force
shrank for an eighth straight month.
	   The Cabinet's latest public works spending package, expected to
total at least 10 trillion yen (dlrs 84 billion), will likely form
the core of a new supplementary budget, the third such
appropriation measure so far this year.
	   The new budget will also include at least 7 trillion yen (dlrs
58.8 billion) in tax cuts, the Nihon Keizai business daily reported
Tuesday.
	   Japan officially estimates gross domestic product will contract
by 1.8 percent for the current fiscal year, which ends next March.
The Japanese economy shrank 0.7 percent last year.

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Cricket rivalries erupted into fighting
that injured at least 20 people as fans watched New Zealand and Sri
Lanka in their Wills International Cup clash, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   The English daily The Independent, reporting from the western
Bangladeshi town of Rajshahi, said the hour-long clashes erupted
Monday after a Sri Lanka supporter was thrown out of a local youth
club by those who were cheering on New Zealand. Sri Lanka won
Monday's televised match.
	   Bangladesh is hosting the tournament, though its own national
team does not have the test status required to play in the
nine-nation event. Bangladeshis are often passionate about sports.
	   Police in Rajshahi, 192 kilometers (120 miles) northwest of the
Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka, where the Wills tournament is being
played, said the cricket fans threw firecrackers at each other and
used other weapons. Police said a number of shops were damaged in
the melee.
	   Six of the injured were hospitalized and reported in stable
condition Tuesday.

Australian city will again light up to greet John Glenn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Residents of the city of Perth have
again been asked to turn on the lights when astronaut John Glenn
passes overhead during his historic return to space.
	   The Western Australia state government said Tuesday it wanted
resident's to help recreate the sight Glenn saw as he passed over
Australia on his three orbit-flight around the globe in February
1962.
	   Then, residents stayed up until midnight and turned on every
house light to send a welcome message to Glenn as he raced through
the night. Every street lamp and neon sign was also lit.
	   According to Thomas Wolfe's book ``The Right Stuff,'' Glenn saw
clouds part to reveal ``an absolute mass of electric lights'' in
two groups, one Perth, the other the town of Rockingham to the
south.
	   ``It was midnight in Perth and Rockingham but practically every
living soul in both places had stayed up to turn on every light
they had for the American sailing overhead in the satellite,''
Wolfe wrote.
	   ``The lights show up very well,'' Glenn radioed to Gordon Cooper
at a tracking station in Australia. ``Please thank everybody for
turning them on will you?''
	   Cooper, installed at the station in Mulchea, a town in what
Wolfe said was ``in the kangaroo boondocks of western Australia,''
said he would.
	   Perth, located 2,100 miles (3,400 kilometers) west of Sydney on
the Indian Ocean, has traded on its reputation as the ``City of
Lights'' ever since.
	   State Premier Richard Court said NASA had advised that, all
things going to plan, 32 minutes past midnight (16:32 GMT) on Oct.
31 was when Glenn would have the best chance to again see Perth's
lights.
	   ``The occasion allows the people of Western Australia to come
together as a community with pride and spirit and also to be part
of the Senator's historic mission,'' Court said.
	   Glenn's flight path will take him further north than last time,
and his ability to see Perth will not be as good, Court said.

Indonesian government to take back land owned by Suharto son
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - A 3,100-hectare (7,660-acre) tract of
land owned by a son of former President Suharto will be returned to
the government, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   President B.J. Habibie is expected to issue a decree by the end
of the month that will allow authorities to take over a forestry
area in Bogor, near the capital, Jakarta.
	   Critics say Suharto, who resigned in May amid riots and
protests, illegally funneled state contracts and assets to his
family and friends during 32 years of authoritarian rule. The
former president has denied accusations of corruption.
	   Last year, Suharto used a presidential decree to grant the land
in Jonggol township in the Bogor area to one of his three sons,
Bambang Trihatmodjo, The Jakarta Post reported.
	   Habibie's new decree, in turn, revokes the order of his
predecessor and one-time mentor.
	   In justifying the revocation, the government alleged special
privileges were granted to Bambang and his partners and city
planning regulations were violated.
	   Habibie has pledged to root out corruption in government and
implement democratic reforms. Prosecutors are investigating
businesses owned by Suharto and his family, but have failed to turn
up any evidence implicating the former president.

Williams, Brown file for free agency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ While Mike Piazza decided to stay in New York,
Bernie Williams took his first step toward leaving.
	   Five days after helping the New York Yankees win the World
Series for the second time in three seasons, the AL batting
champion filed for free agency Monday.
	   Williams, who turned 30 last month, wants a seven-year contract
with a no-trade clause. The Yankees have been reluctant to give him
a deal that long, but the marketplace may have changed after
Piazza's record dlrs 91 million, seven-year contract with the Mets,
which was announced Monday.
	   ``We now know what a premium player is worth when negotiating
with one team,'' said Williams' agent, Scott Boras. ``As what a
premium player is worth when negotiating with multiple teams,
that's yet to be defined.''
	   Williams, cited by many as the glue that kept the Yankees
clubhouse together, hit .339 last season with 26 homers and 97 RBIs
despite missing five weeks with a sprained right knee.
	   ``I think I'll get a chance to stay,'' Williams told the crowd
at the Yankees victory parade Friday.
	   Then he motioned toward Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who
was sitting nearby. ``You've got to talk to this guy right here,''
he added.
	   Yankees general manager Brian Cashman has said re-signing
Williams was the team's top priority, but Boras said he wants to
test the market first.
	   Piazza, traded to the Mets in May, will average dlrs 13 million
a season under his contract, topping the dlrs 12.5 million average
pitcher Pedro Martinez is getting from the dlrs 75 million,
six-year deal he agreed to with Boston last December.
	   ``The Mets showed incredible commitment to me,'' Piazza said.
``If I'm so fortunate as to go into the Hall of Fame someday, it
definitely will be in a Mets uniform.''
	   Williams' teammate Tim Raines also filed for free agency Monday,
as did three players from the NL champion San Diego Padres: pitcher
Kevin Brown and outfielders Steve Finley and John Vander Wal.
	   Brown also is represented by Boras, who spoke with Cashman and
with San Diego general manager Kevin Towers.
	   ``They both expressed that their primary priorities were to
re-sign the players,'' Boras said of the Yankees and Padres.
``We're obviously going to listen to anything the clubs which the
players have played for have to say.''
	   Towers said Monday the Padres could sign one of their top free
agent eligible players before the Nov. 3 vote on a downtown
ballpark.
	   It could be first baseman Wally Joyner, who has indicated that
he would like to finish his career in San Diego. Although eligible,
he has yet to file for free agency.
	   ``I'd say we're moving in the right direction,'' said Joyner's
agent, Barry Axelrod.
	   San Diego also appears to be leaning toward exercising the dlrs
1.9 million option on catcher-first baseman Jim Leyritz, who hit
four home runs in the playoffs. The Padres must make that decision
by Wednesday.
	   Also among the 28 players filing Monday were Baltimore second
baseman Roberto Alomar and Oakland outfielder Rickey Henderson.
Minnesota designated hitter Paul Molitor filed, but is expected to
announce his retirement later this year.
	   In other contract news, Colorado declined a dlrs 2.15 million on
Kirt Manwaring and will pay the catcher a dlrs 500,000 buyout.
Boston exercised a dlrs 750,000 option on pitcher Jim Corsi but
declined its option on pitcher Steve Avery.
	   Los Angeles declined a dlrs 1.4 million option on outfielder Jim
Eisenreich, obtained from Florida during the Marlins' payroll
purge, and will pay a dlrs 200,000 buyout. The Dodgers also
declined a dlrs 5.6 million option on pitcher Ramon Martinez and
will pay a dlrs 600,000 buyout.
	   Philadelphia exercised a dlrs 3 million option on pitcher Mark
Leiter, but declined a dlrs 6 million option on oft-injured
outfielder Lenny Dykstra, who hasn't played since May 18, 1996, and
a dlrs 2.75 million option on pitcher Mark Portugal. Dykstra gets a
dlrs 500,000 buyout and Portugal gets dlrs 300,000.
	   San Francisco exercised its dlrs 3 million option on first
baseman J.T. Snow but declined a dlrs 1.4 million option on pitcher
Osvaldo Fernandez and will pay a dlrs 400,000 buyout.

Moderate earthquake hits southwest China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A moderately strong earthquake rocked a
mountainous corner of southwest China early Tuesday, damaging some
houses, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   The brief Xinhua report did not say if the quake caused any
casualties. But it said teams had been sent to the quake-hit area
in Yunnan province to assess the situation.
	   The 5.2 magnitude earthquake struck Ninglang Yi Autonomous
County, a region of rugged terrain along Yunnan's border with
Sichuan province, Xinhua said. The quake was felt in Ninglang and
in Yanyuan in Sichuan, it said.
	   Ninglang is predominantly inhabited by the Yi, one of China's
many ethnic minorities. The area is one of China's most seismically
active regions. A magnitude 7 earthquake on Feb. 3, 1996, in
neighboring Lijiang killed 255 people and injured 14,000.
	   A magnitude 5.3 earthquake also rocked the area on Oct. 2.

Serb forces make significant redeployment in Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with new quote from Lockhart; EDITS to

 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, facing a Tuesday evening deadline, made a significant
last-minute pullback of his military and police forces in Kosovo in
order to avert NATO airstrikes.
	   U.S. officials in Washington said the Clinton administration
wanted to make sure the pullback was genuine before declaring that
Milosevic had satisfied the terms of the deal he accepted to end
the crisis.
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said: ``We want to make sure
the movements are a real withdrawal and not a reconfiguration'' of
forces.
	   ``They're going down to the wire,'' said Shaun Byrnes, head of
the American section of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission
which has been monitoring the situation since July. ``It's been the
pattern.''
	   Several convoys of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks
carrying Yugoslav troops and police departed several areas of this
southern province of Serbia, the dominant of the two republics in
the Yugoslav federation. According to observers, the forces were
headed for their barracks or back to Serbia.
	   ``They need to pull more people out of Kosovo to satisfy the
agreement (American negotiator) Richard Holbrooke made with
Milosevic,'' Byrnes said in an interview at the end of a strenuous
day of patrolling and observing. ``We will be out looking tomorrow
to see where these people went.''
	   The observer mission is the spearhead of what eventually will be
as many as 2,000 ``ground verifiers,'' under the command of the
54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who
will be checking to see if Milosevic keeps his word.
	   In the Drenica region of central Kosovo, tanks withdrew from
roadside positions where they had dug in Oct. 18. Several police
checkpoints were vacant, including one in Malisevo _ scene of the
last fighting. All that remained was a tattered Serbian flag hung
over a pile of bricks.
	   At another checkpoint, in Dragobilje, which was occupied by
heavily armed police a few days earlier, a uniformed ethnic
Albanian guerrilla stood holding an automatic rifle.
	   Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 were driven from
their homes in seven months of fighting between ethnic Albanians,
who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and Serb forces.
Most of the Albanians want independence.
	   The 16-nation NATO alliance has threatened to launch airstrikes
unless Milosevic halts his crackdown in Kosovo and cut his forces
to levels in place before the conflict began in February.
	   The real test will be if the thousands of people displaced by
the conflict begin returning to their homes. Refugees in all parts
of the country have said repeatedly that they will go home only
with the Serb police leave their villages. So far, returns have
been only a trickle. If that increases significantly, it will mean
a considerable number of police have indeed pulled out.
	   In Washington, Lockhart said there appeared to be ``a lot of
movement,'' but that President Bill Clinton would wait before
judging whether Milosevic had done enough to satisfy Western
demands.
	   A NATO source in Brussels, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the alliance's ambassadors probably would wait until shortly
before Tuesday's deadline before declaring whether Milosevic met
the conditions.
	   He said, NATO was ready to use military force once a deadline
for compliance runs out at 1900 GMT Tuesday. The deadline has
already been extended once since Milosevic agreed on a peace plan.
	   After talks with his EU colleagues in Luxembourg, British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said: ``I have seen the agreement and
Milosevic has not yet done enough. He has got to try harder.''
	   ``If he keeps to this agreement that is now being proposed that
will certainly be a significant advance _ but we want to see the
evidence first.''
	   NATO and the U.N. Security Council also demand that Milosevic
allow international organizations to deliver humanitarian aid to
refugees without interference.

Family of kidnapped Italian priest asks Philippine president for
</HEADLINE>
help

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ The family of an Italian priest
kidnapped more than six weeks ago in the southern Philippines has
asked President Joseph Estrada for help in gaining his release, a
church official said Tuesday.
	   The Rev. Nicola Mapeli, a spokesman of the Pontifical Institute
for Foreign Missions, said relatives of the Rev. Luciano Benedetti
sent Estrada a letter last week via the Philippine Embassy in Rome.
	   Benedetti, 54, from Treviso, was kidnapped Sept. 8 by suspected
Muslim rebels in Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte province, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Zamboanga City.
	   ``The family is worried because of confusing and uncertain
reports which have reached them so far,'' Mapeli said.
	   He said they thanked Estrada for taking personal interest in
Benedetti's case, but asked that ``greater efforts be exercised to
insure that their loved one is released soon, safe and sound.''
	   At least 15 people have been kidnapped in the southern
Philippines since last month. Benedetti is among five foreigners
and five Filipino traders who are still being held by their captors
in the region.
	   On Monday, Estrada claimed his first major victory against
rampant kidnappings with the arrest of eight suspected kidnappers
and the rescue of four victims in the northern Philippines.
	   The group, known as the 50 million peso (dlrs 1.2 million) gang
for the amount of ransom they initially demand, is accused to being
involved in at least 10 kidnappings.
	   Also Monday, police rescued a Muslim teacher hours after she was
abducted by three people in Maluso in southern Basilan province.
One suspect was arrested but two others, including the alleged
mastermind, escaped, police said.

Soros to restructure Quantum hedge fund group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Billionaire investor George Soros plans to shut
down one of his hedge funds and merge two others, according to a
published report.
	   Soros, who runs the dlrs 20 billion Quantum group of hedge
funds, will shut down his dlrs 1.5 billion Quantum Emerging Market
Growth fund, which is down 31 percent for the year to date, the
Financial Times said Tuesday.
	   Soros will also merge the Quantum Industrial Holdings and Quasar
International funds, in part because of the departure of key
London-based hedge fund manager Nick Roditi.
	   In a letter to investors, Soros described the move as a
``significant corporate restructuring,'' the newspaper said. He
described Roditi's departure as being temporary and due to
ill-health.
	   Roditi had been advising both the dlrs 1 billion Quasar fund and
the dlrs 1.7 billion Quota Fund.
	   Soros' Quantum group has gained a reputation for consistently
delivering a top level of investment performance. However, in
recent months this reputation has taken a battering, with some of
the group's highest profile funds suffering significant losses.
	   In late August Soros' chief investment strategist Stanley
Druckenmiller said the Quantum Fund _ the group's flagship _ had
lost about dlrs 2 billion through investments in Russia. Even then,
a spokesman said the fund was up 19 percent for the year, valued at
dlrs 10.6 billion.
	   However, as of Oct. 22, the fund was up only 5 percent for the
year, and is now worth about dlrs 8.7 billion, the newspaper said.
	   News of Soros' restructuring is the latest in a stream of bad
news for hedge funds at a time when financial turmoil in Asia and
Russia threatens to engulf the rest of the world.
	   Hedge funds, which are highly speculative investment funds with
little regulation, have come under tremendous fire since last
month's dlrs 3.6 billion bailout of Connecticut-based Long-Term
Capital Management LP.
	   The fund had more than dlrs 90 billion invested in complex bets
in financial markets around the world. Some of the money was
borrowed in unsecured loans from commercial banks and investment
houses, which would have faced huge losses had the fund collapsed.
	   Several banks subsequently reported dismal results for the third
quarter, led by Swiss-banking giant UBS AG, which took a dlrs 700
million charge because of its exposure to Long-Term Capital.
	   Charlotte, North Carolina-based BankAmerica Corp. also disclosed
earlier this month that it lost nearly a third of a dlrs 1.4
billion unsecured loan to D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co., a securities and
hedge-fund company.
	   Together with the Quantum Industrial Holdings fund, the Emerging
Growth Fund took the brunt of the losses that the group suffered
this year from its Russian investments, the Financial Times said.
	   Investors in the Emerging Growth Fund are to be offered cash or
a special class of shares in the Quantum Fund, the newspaper said.
	   The performance of Roditi's Quota Fund also has been weak in
recent months. It was down 13.6 percent for the year to date as of
Oct. 22, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Officials urge commitment to basic social services
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The global economic crisis and a rash of
natural disasters threaten to roll back improvements in providing
universal basic social services, a U.N.-sponsored conference heard
Tuesday.
	   ``As always, the weakest among us are the ones to suffer the
most,'' Hilde F. Johnson, Norway's minister of international
development and human rights, told the opening session on
implementation of the ``20/20 Initiative.''
	   ``The global economic crisis is forcing people out of work,
families out of their homes and children out of their schools.''
	   Under the 20-20 Initiative, governments are supposed to allocate
20 percent of their budgets _ and donors 20 percent of their aid _
to ensure basic education, primary health care, reproductive health
and population programs, nutrition programs and safe water and
sanitation.
	   Representatives from more than 60 nations and multilateral
organizations are attending the three-day meeting as a follow-up to
a conference in Norway 2 1/2 years ago that forged the initiative.
	   Speakers said progress in reaching the goals has been slow,
complicated by the economic crisis that began in Southeast Asia.
	   ``Twelve months ago, developing countries as a whole were on a
path toward strong growth over the next decade,'' said Nafis Sadik,
executive director of the U.N. Population Fund.
	   ``Now, it is estimated that more than 20 million people fell
back into poverty in East Asia, where growth is likely to be
hesitant for several years to come.''
	   In addition, she said, disasters like floods in Bangladesh and
China have set back recent economic and social gains.
	   Johnson admitted it is hard to convince governments to increase
spending on social services when their budgets are shrinking. But
she said the long-term gains more than outweigh the costs.
	   ``No investment is more important than primary health and
education,'' Johnson said. ``No investment yields higher returns.
	   ``If Asia _ on top of its current financial trouble _
experiences real setbacks in health and education, it will
undoubtedly mean an even more serious setback for development.''
	   The cost of achieving universal coverage of basic social
services is estimated at around dlrs 206 billion to dlrs 216
billion per year _ less than 1 percent of global output and less
than half the amount spent on tobacco. Actual spending is only
about dlrs 136 billion, Sadik said.
	   Johnson put the benefits in practical terms.
	   ``Only healthy children fully benefit from schooling,'' she
said. ``Only healthy adults can utilize their full potential ...
Illness breeds dependency and diminishes the possibilities of
everyone. It is an obstacle to development.
	   ``World Bank studies even show that educating girls is the
single most profitable investment of all'' because it brings higher
productivity, lower infant and maternal mortality and lower
fertility, Johnson said.
	   Sadik said that each year, about 12 million children die of
preventable causes and some 600,000 women of pregnancy-related
complications. Nearly 1 billion adults remain illiterate, more than
1 billion people have no access to safe water, and nearly 3 billion
lack access to adequate sanitation.
	   While developed countries are shirking their responsibilities,
Johnson said poor nations also need to make good-faith efforts by
switching priorities from military spending to social programs,
fighting corruption and implementing consistent policies.

Benaud leads congratulations for Taylor's team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from prime minister John Howard, Graham Gooch;
EDITS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Richie Benaud, the only other
Australian cricket captain to win a series in Pakistan, was among
the first to congratulate Mark Taylor's side for wrapping up a 1-0
triumph in Karachi.
	   ``I thought the senior players _ Mark Taylor, Steve Waugh and
Ian Healy in particular _ were outstanding but the entire team made
contributions,'' Benaud said Tuesday. ``It's fantastic.''
	   Benaud's team beat Pakistan 2-0 in the 1959-60 series while
Taylor's team set up its 1-0 win with a victory in the first test
and draws in the second and third.
	   ``It was slightly disappointing they didn't win the last test
for 2-0,'' Benaud said. ``But it was a marvelous effort and the
team deserves every plaudit it's getting, every one.''
	   Bob Simpson led an Australian team to Pakistan as captain in
Pakistan in 1964-65 and coached teams led by Allan Border in
1988-89 and Taylor in 1994. He lost all three times.
	   ``It is without doubt a great achievement, especially to
dominate the whole series and win so comfortably,'' Simpson said
Tuesday. ``The (1994 series) was very frustrating because we
probably played just as well and lost.''
	   Taylor's 1994 team was deprived of victory by a record
last-wicket stand in the third test as the hosts made more than 300
on the final day.
	   His first test in Pakistan resulted in two ducks and the series
loss but he was heralded as Australia's man of the series after the
victory and his Australian record-equaling 334 in the second game.
	   Taylor, who had been expected to retire in March following the
upcoming Ashes tour by England, said the series may have increased
his time in the game.
	   ``This series has been fantastic,'' Taylor told Australian
radio. ``I've been a winning captain, I've been man of the series,
made 500 runs, made a triple century in test cricket. If that keeps
continuing, well I'll keep playing for Australia.''
	   Australian prime minister John Howard, a passionate cricket fan,
said it was a personal triumph for Taylor who was on the verge of
quitting during last year's Ashes tour of England.
	   ``On a personal level he's repudiated, in the most convincing
way imaginable, those people who a year or two ago were saying he
was past his peak,'' Howard said. ``There were a lot of us who
didn't believe he was past his peak, there were a lot of us who
retained a great deal of faith in him.''
	   England coach Graham Gooch, preparing a side to meet Australia
on its return from the subcontinent, also praised Taylor's outfit.
	   ``It's not an easy place to win; it's tough conditions and
Pakistan are a difficult side to predict,'' said Gooch. ``They're a
bit erratic but you have got to give Australia credit, they did
well. I have to congratulate them.''
	   Australian cricket writers said the series win was one of the
most important in the country's history.
	   ``It ranks with victory in the West Indies three years ago as a
defining moment in the modern game,'' wrote Malcolm Conn in The
Australian.
	   Mark Ray, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, said Taylor's
``place in the first rank of Australian captains was confirmed'' by
the victory.

Cargo ship docks smoothly with Mir space station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A cargo ship carrying food, water, fuel and a
giant space mirror docked smoothly with the Mir space station on
Tuesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The Progress cargo ship had blasted off from the Baikonur
cosmodrome in Kazakstan on Sunday. It was the third and final cargo
ship to Mir this year.
	   The launch was originally scheduled for August, but postponed
several times, most recently because the Russian space agency
couldn't afford to buy the booster rocket.
	   The Progress' cargo also contains New Year's gifts for the two
cosmonauts, Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev, and scientific
equipment, including the space mirror and a device to collect data
about meteorites when Mir flies through a meteorite cloud in
mid-November.
	   The mirror, called the Znamya, or Banner, is expected to be
unfurled in February, when Progress is jettisoned from Mir.
	   The mirror, about 100 feet (33 meters) in diameter, is a
membrane covered with a metal layer that, in theory, should reflect
sunlight onto some of the chilly reaches of Russia during the long
nights.
	   However, officials say the Znamya would only be visible in good
weather and to those who knew its precise position. They said it
would resemble a shooting star, not a large object such as the
moon.

Yeltsin's weak health forces cancellation of Austrian trip
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin-Primakov meeting in 3rd graf. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos MOSB109-110 &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin is skipping yet another foreign trip
because of his fragile health, canceling Tuesday's visit to Austria
on doctors' orders to rest from high blood pressure and extreme
fatigue.
	   Yeltsin's announcement Monday, coming after months as barely a
part-time president, fueled speculation about his ability to stay
in office and guide Russia through its worst economic crisis in the
post-Soviet era.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is going to Vienna in Yeltsin's
place. Primakov and Yeltsin held talks Tuesday morning at the
president's Gorky-9 country residence outside Moscow, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin's doctors ordered him not to make the one-day trip to
Austria because he was suffering from an ``asthenic condition,''
the president's office said. Asthenia refers to a lack of physical
strength.
	   Yeltsin's blood pressure was also unstable and doctors
recommended a vacation, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said. There were no plans to hospitalize Yeltsin.
	   Yeltsin aide Oleg Sysuyev said the 67-year-old president would
likely start a two-week vacation Wednesday somewhere near Moscow.
	   ``This is perhaps the first time recently when the president has
listened to his doctors' advice,'' Sysuyev said Monday on the
Russian TV program ``Hero of the Day.''
	   ``The president is not ill enough to be considered incapable of
working,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin's recent ailments have heightened calls for his
resignation. If he were to step down _ though he insists he won't _
he would be replaced by Primakov, who would be required to call new
elections within three months.
	   Primakov has been prime minister for only six weeks and has yet
to produce his own blueprint to deal with the country's deep-rooted
economic problems. But he is widely respected by all political
factions and is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when
Yeltsin has receded into the background.
	   For several months now, Yeltsin has rarely put in full days at
the Kremlin, spending most of his time at his country residences.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems,
including heart bypass surgery in 1996. The president and his
doctors insist that he'll serve out the rest of his term, set to
end in the summer of 2000, and they deny he has crippling health
problems.
	   Still, Yeltsin clearly lacks the energy he displayed in his
early years in office.
	   Potential candidates in the 2000 presidential race have already
begun an informal campaign to replace Yeltsin. Leading contenders
include Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov and Alexander Lebed, a former general and now governor of
a vast Siberian region.
	   Russian newspapers have speculated that Yeltsin is afflicted
with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, but their reports are
based simply on his public appearances, not on medical
examinations.
	   Yeltsin cannot point to any major accomplishments since he was
re-elected in 1996, yet many warn his resignation would trigger a
political crisis on top of Russia's economic turmoil.
	   Yeltsin was forced to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier
this month because of a respiratory infection. He has already
canceled a visit to Malaysia that was planned for next month, but a
visit to India in December was still on his schedule.

Investigators question businessman over mine share deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Government investigators Tuesday
questioned one of Indonesia's top businessmen following allegations
of corruption over a share deal with a U.S. gold mining company.
	   Officials at the Indonesian attorney general's office said they
had called in Aburizal Bakrie, the chairman of the Bakrie Group,
which is one of Indonesia's largest conglomerates.
	   Last month an American college professor Jeffrey Winters alleged
the involvement of Indonesian senior economic minister Ginandjar
Kartasasmita in a 1991 share transaction between PT Freeport
Indonesia and the Bakrie group.
	   The deal led to the renewal of Freeport's operating contract
that year.
	   Both Bakrie and Ginandjar, who was mining minister at the time,
have denied any wrongdoing.
	   The government accused Winters of insulting a senior government
official. Initially it banned Winters from visiting Indonesia, but
later said it had lifted the ban so he could explain his
accusations.
	   Freeport Indonesia is the subsidiary of New Orleans-based
Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Inc.
	   Bakrie's questioning comes after the attorney general's office
Monday questioned Kosim Gandataruna, who was the director general
of general mining in 1991.
	   Ginandjar has also made a statement to the attorney-general's
office.
	   The office also said it plans to question Freeport-McMoran's
chief executive officer James Moffet.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India accused Pakistan of trying to
capture territory on an icy border battlefield and said its forces
killed six enemy soldiers in repulsing the attack, a news agency
reported Tuesday.
	   United New of India, quoting the Defense Ministry, said the
fighting with mortars and shells occurred Monday evening on the
Siachen Glacier.
	   The glacier, some 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) north of New
Delhi, is more than 20,000 feet (6,000 meters) above sea level.
Both India and Pakistan claim Siachen, and skirmishes are common
across the frontier despite the severe conditions. Temperatures on
Siachen usually hover around minus 55 Celsius (minus 67
Fahrenheit), with wind speeds of up to 100 kilometers (66 miles)
per hour.
	   The Siachen dispute is among the items to be discussed next
month by Indian and Pakistani secretaries of defense, water and
power, police, commerce and culture. The talks aimed at normalizing
relations are part of a round that began earlier this month with
talks between the two countries' foreign secretaries.
	   The foreign secretaries' talks, which ended inconclusively with
promises of more meetings next year, were also preceded by fighting
on Siachen.

England hides away a new spin brigade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ England's spin doctor Peter Philpott
took a beginner's bowling class Tuesday while coach Graham Gooch
spared some blushes by banning the media.
	   Philpott, an Australian drafted into the England camp to help
them prepare to face longtime nemesis Shane Warne, planned to teach
the squad's batsmen how to bowl leg-spin.
	   Wrist spin is the most difficult form of delivery to get right
and amateurs are quickly exposed when they fail to release the ball
properly.
	   Fearing any pictures or reports of players such as Alec Stewart
and Mike Atherton struggling to unravel the mystique of the
difficult bowling art, Gooch kept the media outside.
	   Warne, who has taken 85 wickets in 17 Ashes tests, has not
played since shoulder surgery last April but hopes to be fit for
the first Test starting in Brisbane on Nov. 20.
	   Philpott said England's knowledge of wrist spin needed
expanding.
	   ``They will be bowling them so they understand where the hand
has got to be to deliver each ball, Philpott said. ``Basically if
you can do something a little then you have got a much better
chance of understanding it.''
	   Philpott said because English players were not exposed to much
wrist spin, ``they have developed mystiques that just aren't
there.''
	   ``There's only a certain amount any legspinner can do, it's all
logical, there's nothing mysterious,'' Philpott said.
	   England plays its first match against an Australian Cricket
Board Chairman's XI at Lilac Hill, near Perth, on Thursday.

Yeltsin's weak health forces cancellation of Austrian trip

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin is skipping yet another foreign trip
because of his fragile health, canceling Tuesday's visit to Austria
on doctors' orders to rest from high blood pressure and extreme
fatigue.
	   Yeltsin's announcement Monday, coming after months as barely a
part-time president, fueled speculation about his ability to stay
in office and guide Russia through its worst economic crisis in the
post-Soviet era.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov went to Vienna in Yeltsin's
place. Before leaving, Primakov and Yeltsin held talks at the
president's Gorky-9 country residence outside Moscow, Yeltsin's
press service said.
	   Yeltsin's doctors ordered him not to make the one-day trip to
Austria because he was suffering from an ``asthenic condition,''
the president's office said. Asthenia refers to a lack of physical
strength.
	   Yeltsin's blood pressure was also unstable and doctors
recommended a vacation, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said. There were no plans to hospitalize Yeltsin.
	   Yeltsin aide Oleg Sysuyev said the 67-year-old president would
likely start a two-week vacation Wednesday somewhere near Moscow.
	   ``This is perhaps the first time recently when the president has
listened to his doctors' advice,'' Sysuyev said Monday on the
Russian TV program ``Hero of the Day.''
	   ``The president is not ill enough to be considered incapable of
working,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin's recent ailments have heightened calls for his
resignation. If he were to step down _ though he insists he won't _
he would be replaced by Primakov, who would be required to call new
elections within three months.
	   Primakov has been prime minister for only six weeks and has yet
to produce his own blueprint to deal with the country's deep-rooted
economic problems. But he is widely respected by all political
factions and is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when
Yeltsin has receded into the background.
	   For several months now, Yeltsin has rarely put in full days at
the Kremlin, spending most of his time at his country residences.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems,
including heart bypass surgery in 1996. The president and his
doctors insist that he'll serve out the rest of his term, set to
end in the summer of 2000, and they deny he has crippling health
problems.
	   Still, Yeltsin clearly lacks the energy he displayed in his
early years in office.
	   Potential candidates in the 2000 presidential race have already
begun an informal campaign to replace Yeltsin. Leading contenders
include Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov and Alexander Lebed, a former general and now governor of
a vast Siberian region.
	   Russian newspapers have speculated that Yeltsin is afflicted
with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, but their reports are
based simply on his public appearances, not on medical
examinations.
	   Yeltsin cannot point to any major accomplishments since he was
re-elected in 1996, yet many warn his resignation would trigger a
political crisis on top of Russia's economic turmoil.
	   Yeltsin was forced to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier
this month because of a respiratory infection. He has already
canceled a visit to Malaysia that was planned for next month, but a
visit to India in December was still on his schedule.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks fall slightly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore dropped writethru sequence, editors note &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday stocks, dollar bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early Tuesday
on speculation the Bank of China was poised to sell dollars and on
rekindled concern over hedge funds' exposure to losses in emerging
markets. Tokyo stock prices declined slightly.
	   The dollar bought 118.98 yen in late morning trading, down 0.04
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its New York rate of
119.10 yen in late trading overnight.
	   The dollar weakened in Tokyo on rumors the Bank of China has
outstanding offers to sell the U.S. currency at the 119 yen level,
traders said.
	   They also said the dollar was hurt by worry over the health of
U.S. hedge funds following word that investor George Soros plans to
shut down his dlrs 1.5 billion Quantum Emerging Growth Fund.
	   In New York trading, the dollar had risen against the yen and
other major currencies after Italy cut interest rates. The
long-awaited move by the Bank of Italy was expected to pave the way
for more rate cuts in Europe.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average fell 42.67 points, or 0.31 percent, to 13,800.84 as
of midday. On Monday, the average closed down 301.24 points, or
2.13 percent.
	   The market opened higher on a report the government plans to
increase stimulus spending, but gave back its early gains in light
trading. A dearth of fresh incentives prevented stocks from making
decisive losses or gains, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section declined 4.78 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,043.96.
The TOPIX had closed down 19.41 points, or 1.81 percent, the day
before.
	   Shares were buoyed at the outset of trading after the Nihon
Keizai business daily said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party may
hike spending in a new supplementary budget to 1 trillion yen (dlrs
8.47 billion), traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.880 percent from Monday's finish of 0.870 percent,
driving its price down to 108.17 yen from 108.27 yen.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, facing a Tuesday evening deadline, made a last-minute
pullback of his military and police forces in Kosovo in order to
avert NATO airstrikes.
	   U.S. officials in Washington said the Clinton administration
wanted to make sure the pullback was genuine before declaring that
Milosevic had satisfied the terms of the deal he accepted to end
the crisis.
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said: ``We want to make sure
the movements are a real withdrawal and not a reconfiguration'' of
forces.
	   ``They're going down to the wire,'' said Shaun Byrnes, head of
the American section of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission
which has been monitoring the situation since July. ``It's been the
pattern.''
	   Several convoys of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks
carrying Yugoslav troops and police departed several areas of this
southern province of Serbia, the dominant of the two republics in
the Yugoslav federation. According to observers, the forces were
headed for their barracks or back to Serbia.
	   ``They need to pull more people out of Kosovo to satisfy the
agreement (American negotiator) Richard Holbrooke made with
Milosevic,'' Byrnes said in an interview at the end of a strenuous
day of patrolling and observing. ``We will be out looking tomorrow
to see where these people went.''
	   The observer mission is the spearhead of what eventually will be
as many as 2,000 ``ground verifiers,'' under the command of the
54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who
will be checking to see if Milosevic keeps his word.
	   In the Drenica region of central Kosovo, tanks withdrew from
roadside positions where they had dug in Oct. 18. Several police
checkpoints were vacant, including one in Malisevo _ scene of the
last fighting. All that remained was a tattered Serbian flag hung
over a pile of bricks.
	   At another checkpoint, in Dragobilje, which was occupied by
heavily armed police a few days earlier, a uniformed ethnic
Albanian guerrilla stood holding an automatic rifle.
	   Hundreds of people have died and nearly 300,000 driven from
their homes in seven months of fighting between ethnic Albanians,
who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and Serb forces.
Most of the Albanians want independence.
	   The 16-nation NATO alliance has threatened to launch airstrikes
unless Milosevic halts his crackdown in Kosovo and cut his forces
to levels in place before the conflict began in February.
	   The real test will be if the thousands of people displaced by
the conflict begin returning to their homes. Refugees in all parts
of the country have said repeatedly they will go home only if the
Serb police leave their villages. So far, only a few have returned.
If the trickle increases significantly, it will mean a considerable
number of police have indeed pulled out.
	   In Washington, Lockhart said there appeared to be ``a lot of
movement,'' but that President Bill Clinton would wait before
judging whether Milosevic had done enough to satisfy Western
demands.
	   A NATO source in Brussels, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the alliance's ambassadors probably would wait until shortly
before Tuesday's deadline before declaring whether Milosevic met
the conditions.
	   He said, NATO was ready to use military force once a deadline
for compliance runs out at 1900 GMT Tuesday. The deadline has
already been extended once since Milosevic agreed on a peace plan.
	   After talks with his EU colleagues in Luxembourg, British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said: ``I have seen the agreement and
Milosevic has not yet done enough. He has got to try harder.''
	   ``If he keeps to this agreement that is now being proposed that
will certainly be a significant advance _ but we want to see the
evidence first.''
	   NATO and the U.N. Security Council also demand that Milosevic
allow international organizations to deliver humanitarian aid to
refugees without interference.

Australia debates the effect of its gun control laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A gun control lobbying group said
Tuesday that tough laws imposed after a shooting massacre in
Australia in 1996 have made the country a safer place to live.
	   But a pro-gun group said the laws have spawned a thriving black
market for machine guns and pistols.
	   Australia adopted national uniform gun laws after Martin
Bryant's shooting rampage killed 35 people and injured 19 at the
Port Arthur tourist site in Tasmania in April 1996. Bryant is
serving a life sentence after pleading guilty to the murders.
	   Under the new laws, about 640,000 firearms were removed from the
Australian community under a buy back program that saw the
government pay owners for guns being made illegal.
	   New crime figures released by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics figures show that the number of robberies involving guns
jumped 39 percent in the 12 months of 1997 to 2,183. Assaults with
guns rose 28 percent to 806. Murders with guns _ excluding the Port
Arthur massacre _ increased by 19 percent to 75.
	   The Coalition for Gun Control said the 1997 statistics don't
indicate the success of the new laws regarding weapons because they
didn't come into force completely until July 1998.
	   Coalition spokesman Roland Brown said the national arsenal of
privately held weapons is now less dangerous because rapid fire
weapons were among the thousands taken out of the community.
	   Research by the Australian Institute of Criminology shows that
almost half of firearm homicides between 1990 and 1997 involved
weapons now prohibited or restricted by the new laws.
	   Brown said the tighter gun laws will take several more years to
become effective, in the same way that laws to control drunken
driving took time to reduce the road death toll.
	   ``It can take five or 10 years for these laws to become fully
effective and for the results to show,'' he said. ``One thing for
sure _ we haven't had a massacre since Port Arthur.''
	   He said the buy-back scheme was as an unqualified success.
	   ``Australia is a safer place. Rapid-fire weapons are just about
finished in Australia, and this has reduced the prospect of mass
killings significantly.''
	   However, one pro-gun group said the new controls have created a
thriving black market.
	   ``The black market of pistols has increased tenfold, and both
criminals and non-criminals seek them. The black market of
machine-guns has at least tripled,'' said Ron Owen, president of
the Firearm Owners Association of Australia.
	   Crime statistics can be misleading, he said. Research shows that
one-third of all firearm murders involve intimate partners.
	   ``You're less likely to die in a Port Arthur massacre,
statistically, than you are in your own home,'' Brown said.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ People fled their coastal homes and
the Honduran government sent air force planes to pluck residents
off remote Caribbean islands Monday in the face of the most
powerful hurricane in a decade to threaten Central America.
	   Hurricane Mitch became a Category 5 hurricane _ the strongest
category there is _ with winds of 180 mph (285 kph) Monday. By 0600
GMT Tuesday, Mitch's center was just west of Honduras' Swan Island
and was moving northwest at 8 mph (12 kph).
	   ``Mitch is expected to remain a very dangerous hurricane capable
of causing catastrophic damage,'' the U.S. National Weather Service
said from its National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   The hurricane posed no immediate threat to the United States,
and was expected to remain in the northwest Caribbean for the next
five days, the center said.
	   Jerry Jarrell, the center's director, said Mitch was the
strongest hurricane to strike the Caribbean since Gilbert in 1988,
which killed more than 300 people.
	   The government of Belize closed schools Monday and sent its
employees who work along the coast home early to prepare for the
storm. Mexico mobilized troops and emergency workers on the
Caribbean coast of the Yucatan peninsula.
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of
alert and told coastal residents to leave their homes for safer
ground farther inland.
	   ``Where can I go if I leave my house? The government hasn't
opened a single shelter,'' asked Pedro Martinez, an electrician in
the city of San Pedro Sula, 100 miles (160 kilometers) miles north
of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa.
	   Authorities in San Pedro Sula planned to set up shelters in
public schools.
	   In La Ceiba, on Honduras' western coast, people stood in long
lines at filling stations to buy gasoline under a steady rain
Monday. Maria Gonzalez said she needed the gas to cook with in case
her firewood gets wet.
	   ``I have six children, and we live in a riverbed,'' she said.
``If it gets real bad, we'll go to the church and see what the
architect of the world has in store for us.''
	   The president ordered all air force planes and helicopters to
evacuate people from the Bay islands, a string of small islands off
the central coast.
	   Swinwick Jackson, a fisherman on one of the islands, had tied up
his boats and was planning to take his family to stay with a
relative on higher ground. Speaking by telephone from Utila, 20
miles (32 kilometers) north of La Ceiba, he said most tourists had
left the island Sunday but some were stranded, and hotels were
moving them to houses in the mountains.
	   ``Mitch is closing in, and God help us in the coming hours,''
said Utila Mayor Monterrey Cardenas.
	   Police spokesman Ivan Mejia said three rivers _ the Coco,
Segovia and Cruta _ all overflowed their banks Monday along the
eastern Honduran coast.
	   In El Progreso, 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Tegucigalpa,
the army evacuated more than 5,000 people from low-lying banana
plantations along the Ulua River, said resident Nolly Soliman.
	   Before bearing down on Honduras, Mitch swept past Jamaica and
the Cayman Islands. Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican
capital of Kingston, and government offices and schools closed in
the Caymans, a British colony of 28,000 people.
	   Heavy rains began to fall along the Honduran coast Sunday night.
	   Flores Facusse, the Honduran president, ordered all public
offices and schools on the Caribbean coast to close by noon Monday.
	   ``We're ready for whatever situation occurs,'' said Vice
President Billy Handal. ``I ask God to be benevolent with
Hondurans.''
	   The strongest hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory was
Fifi, which ravaged Honduras in 1974 and killed at least 2,000
people.

Report: Indonesia's president ignores demands to fire minister

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president has rejected
demands from within the nation's Hindu minority that he fire a
Muslim Cabinet minister they accuse of insulting their religion, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Indonesian media reports have quoted Food Minister A.M.
Saefuddin as saying that opposition faction leader Megawati
Sukarnoputri should not be elected president of predominately
Muslim Indonesia because she is a ``Hindu.''
	   The comments triggered outrage among Hindus, particularly on the
economically important tourist island of Bali.
	   Some Hindus there have threatened to stage a mass strike unless
President B.J. Habibie fires Saefuddin within one month. They also
want the minister prosecuted.
	   Megawati, the popular daughter of Indonesia's founding President
Sukarno, is in fact a Muslim, although her grandmother was
Balinese.
	   The Jakarta Post newspaper quoted Habibie's main spokesman,
State Secretary Akbar Tanjung, as saying on Monday that the
president had no plans to reshuffle his Cabinet.
	   ``As far as I know, the president is satisfied with the
performance of all his ministers,'' Akbar said after a meeting with
Habibie.
	   Earlier this month, Saefuddin downplayed Megawati's chances of
being elected president when he reportedly asked: ``Are the
Indonesian people willing to have a Hindu president?''
	   He later apologized, saying he had no intention of insulting any
religion.
	   On Tuesday, about 70 Muslims rallied outside the Parliament in
support of Saefuddin.
	   The group, calling itself the Young Generation for Indonesian
Development, said the next Indonesian president should be a Muslim
and a man in line with teachings in the Koran, Islam's holy book.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation. Religious
tolerance is enshrined in the national philosophy and constitution.
	   Indonesia plans to stage parliamentary elections in May under
promised democratic reforms. Legislators will then select a new
president. Saefuddin, Megawati and Habibie, who is also Muslim, are
among those expected to stand for the presidency.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ People fled their coastal homes and
the Honduran government sent air force planes to pluck residents
off remote Caribbean islands Monday in the face of the most
powerful hurricane in a decade to threaten Central America.
	   Hurricane Mitch became a Category 5 hurricane _ the strongest
category there is _ with winds of 180 mph (285 kph) Monday. By 0600
GMT Tuesday, Mitch's center was just west of Honduras' Swan Island
and was moving northwest at 8 mph (12 kph).
	   ``Mitch is expected to remain a very dangerous hurricane capable
of causing catastrophic damage,'' the U.S. National Weather Service
said from its National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   The hurricane posed no immediate threat to the United States,
and was expected to remain in the northwest Caribbean for the next
five days, the center said.
	   Jerry Jarrell, the center's director, said Mitch was the
strongest hurricane to strike the Caribbean since Gilbert in 1988,
which killed more than 300 people.
	   The government of Belize closed schools Monday and sent its
employees who work along the coast home early to prepare for the
storm. Mexico mobilized troops and emergency workers on the
Caribbean coast of the Yucatan peninsula.
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of
alert and told coastal residents to leave their homes for safer
ground farther inland.
	   ``Where can I go if I leave my house? The government hasn't
opened a single shelter,'' asked Pedro Martinez, an electrician in
the city of San Pedro Sula, 100 miles (160 kilometers) miles north
of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa.
	   Authorities in San Pedro Sula planned to set up shelters in
public schools.
	   In La Ceiba, on Honduras' western coast, people stood in long
lines at filling stations to buy gasoline under a steady rain
Monday. Maria Gonzalez said she needed the gas to cook with in case
her firewood gets wet.
	   ``I have six children, and we live in a riverbed,'' she said.
``If it gets real bad, we'll go to the church and see what the
architect of the world has in store for us.''
	   The president ordered all air force planes and helicopters to
evacuate people from the Bay islands, a string of small islands off
the central coast.
	   Swinwick Jackson, a fisherman on one of the islands, had tied up
his boats and was planning to take his family to stay with a
relative on higher ground. Speaking by telephone from Utila, 20
miles (32 kilometers) north of La Ceiba, he said most tourists had
left the island Sunday but some were stranded, and hotels were
moving them to houses in the mountains.
	   ``Mitch is closing in, and God help us in the coming hours,''
said Utila Mayor Monterrey Cardenas.
	   Police spokesman Ivan Mejia said three rivers _ the Coco,
Segovia and Cruta _ all overflowed their banks Monday along the
eastern Honduran coast.
	   In El Progreso, 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Tegucigalpa,
the army evacuated more than 5,000 people from low-lying banana
plantations along the Ulua River, said resident Nolly Soliman.
	   Before bearing down on Honduras, Mitch swept past Jamaica and
the Cayman Islands. Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican
capital of Kingston, and government offices and schools closed in
the Caymans, a British colony of 28,000 people.
	   Heavy rains began to fall along the Honduran coast Sunday night.
	   Flores Facusse, the Honduran president, ordered all public
offices and schools on the Caribbean coast to close by noon Monday.
	   ``We're ready for whatever situation occurs,'' said Vice
President Billy Handal. ``I ask God to be benevolent with
Hondurans.''
	   The strongest hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory was
Fifi, which ravaged Honduras in 1974 and killed at least 2,000
people.

UNDP official says North Korea needs agricultural recovery aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ North Korea needs international aid to help its
farmers produce as much food as they did in the early 1990s, before
natural disasters pushed the country to the brink of famine, the
U.N. Development Program's chief said Tuesday.
	   North Korea is expected to produce 3 million tons of food this
year, only two-thirds of its ``very basic minimum needs'' and half
of what it produced in the early 1990s, James Gustave Speth, the
UNDP administrator, told reporters after a trip in North Korea.
	   Four years of chronic food shortages caused by crop-destroying
weather and government mismanagement have left North Korea's
economy in tatters and its people heavily reliant on foreign aid.
	   U.N. aid agencies plan to launch an appeal to provide fertilizer
and other support for agriculture, Speth said. The goal is to help
the North grow enough of its own food so that food aid can end.
	   Restoring agriculture would be cheaper than continuing food aid,
which ``can't continue forever,'' Speth said.
	   About dlrs 400 million per year is given to North Korea in food
assistance. The proposed agricultural rebuilding program would cost
about around dlrs 100 million per year, he said.
	   ``Widespread famine that was a possibility has been averted due
to the concerted international response,'' the UNDP chief said.
	   But there is still widespread malnourishment, including in
children ages 7 to 14 who were too old to benefit from aid programs
that targeted younger children, he said.

24 killed when runaway train hits Russian bus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Transport officials said Tuesday they were
investigating how five wagons broke away from a train and collided
with a bus in the Russian Far East, killing 24 people.
	   The bus was torn apart when the rail cars carrying concrete
panels and other construction materials rammed into it at an
unmanned railroad crossing in Khabarovsk, about 6,100 kilometers
(3,800 miles) southeast of Moscow on Monday.
	   The bus was carrying 26 passengers, including eight children
between the ages of 11 and 14, the ITAR-Tass news agency said,
quoting a duty officer at the Emergency Situations Ministry.
	   Twenty-one people died instantly and three more died later in a
hospital, ITAR-Tass said.

Dollar slightly higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks close lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon bond and currency
prices; Nomura Trust and Banking takes an ampersand &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose moderately against the yen
Tuesday as buying on growing confidence the greenback will continue
to strengthen offset bouts of profit-taking. Tokyo stock prices
closed lower.
	   The dollar bought 119.28 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 0.26
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its New York rate of
119.10 yen in late trading overnight.
	   The U.S. currency improved upon gains in New York triggered by
Italy's decision to cut interest rates even as moves by some Tokyo
dealers to lock-in recent gains prevented the dollar from staging a
rally.
	   ``The market is biding its time, and the only way we'll get to
120 yen is in fits and starts,'' said Takeo Suzuki, deputy foreign
exchange manager in the Tokyo office of Nomura Trust and Banking.
	   In New York, the dollar had risen against the yen and other
major currencies after the long-awaited move by the Bank of Italy,
which was expected to pave the way for more rate cuts in Europe.
	   The dollar had dipped in early Tokyo trading on rumors that the
Bank of China made offers to sell the U.S. currency at the 119 yen
level, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average fluttered in and out of negative territory before
finally closing slightly lower, posting a third consecutive day of
declines.
	   The Nikkei fell 22.78 points, or 0.16 percent, to close at
13,820.68. On Monday, the average closed down 301.24 points, or
2.13 percent.
	   ``There are no new incentives to make investors buy as the
market has factored in measures to stabilize the financial system
and the short covering of bank shares has been completed,'' said
Masatoshi Sato, manager of investor information group at Kankaku
Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section declined 5.76 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,042.98.
The TOPIX had closed down 19.41 points, or 1.81 percent, the day
before.
	   Shares were buoyed at the outset of trading after the Nihon
Keizai business daily said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party may
hike spending in a new supplementary budget to 1 trillion yen (dlrs
8.47 billion), traders said.
	   But the news was quickly absorbed and had no lasting impact on
the day's trading.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.900 percent from Monday's finish of 0.870 percent,
driving its price down to 107.98 yen from 108.27 yen.

Government angry at opposition calls to halt loans to Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The government on Tuesday accused
opposition leaders of risking the Cambodian people's survival by
calling for international lenders to stop providing loans to the
kingdom.
	   Opposition chiefs Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy asked
the Asian Development Bank, in a letter sent to the bank's
president on Monday, to withhold further loans to Cambodia until a
new coalition government is in place.
	   ``They are destroying the rice pot, depriving the people who
voted for them during elections of their food,'' government
spokesman Sieng Lapresse said at a news briefing on Tuesday.
	   The national treasury is in dire need of the foreign investment
and assistance lost after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh in a coup d'etat
in July of last year. The potential for problems has been
highlighted by the recent arrival in the capital of many farmers
from the countryside seeking food.
	   Sieng Lapresse said the government ``still has the right to seek
loans from outside to allow the people to survive.''
	   In their letter to the ADB, Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, who have
been abroad since just after the ceremonial opening of the new
national assembly session on Sep. 24, warned that any loans given
by the Manila-based bank to the present regime would be considered
illegal.
	   ``We earnestly hope that international institutions will refrain
from lending funds or credibility to such a regime while it lacks
the legal status that may only be conferred by the people of
Cambodia through the constitutional process,'' Ranariddh and Rainsy
said in the letter.
	   Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party emerged as a winner in
July elections, but fell short of attaining the two-thirds majority
needed to install a new government.
	   Negotiations to form a new coalition government have been
stalled by the opposition's insistence that their claims that Hun
Sen's victory was achieved through fraud be investigated.
	   The stalemate has been further complicated by disputes between
the ruling party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC over which should take
the presidency of the national assembly.

Government, Tamil rebels inching towards peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Sri Lankan government and Tamil
separatist are looking for an opening to resume peace peace talks,
political analysts and government ministers said Tuesday.
	   The issue of resuming talks to end the 15-year-old Tamil
insurrection that has left an estimated 55,000 dead, 1 million
displaced and the economy in a shambles is so sensitive that
government ministers declined to speak on the record. But they
admit privately that the administration is looking for an opening.
	   Before the government commits itself to talks with the main
rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, it will have to
obtain total backing of the main opposition United National Party.
Without opposition support, the administration will be unable to
offer concessions to the rebels. The governing People's Alliance
Party has only a one-seat majority in the 225-member Parliament.
	   Next month's visit by British envoy Derek Fatchett could be
crucial. Fatchett is a successor to Liam Fox, who helped the UNP
and the government reach an agreement in 1997 that later faltered.
	   Fatchett is coming to inaugurate a British trade fair, but his
schedule includes meeting with President Chandrika Kumaratunga and
UNP leader Ranil Wickramasinghe, British diplomats said.
	   There are indications that the LTTE, which is now confined to
northern jungles and one northern town, may also be willing to
resume the dialogue they broke off in April 1995 by staging
surprise attacks.
	   Last weekend the LTTE freed six Sri Lankan soldiers after
holding them for about five years. The soldiers said they were
puzzled by the LTTE gesture.
	   ``The only reason I can even imagine is that they may have some
idea of wanting to have talks with the government,'' said one of
the freed men, Lance. Corp. D.E. Amarasinghe.
	   The LTTE said over its clandestine Voice of the Tigers radio
that the soldiers were released as a ``goodwill gesture.''
	   A top LTTE official said earlier this month that the group was
not against a dialogue. Citing the examples of Kosovo and Bosnia,
Tiger spokesman V. Rudrakumaran, a U.S.-based lawyer, told
Colombo's Midweek Mirror that any major Western power could bring
the two sides together to talk.
	   The government is hoping to persuade the LTTE, which is fighting
for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in the north and
the east, to agree instead to greater autonomy for Tamil-dominated
areas within a federal structure.
	   ``It is the only objective, well-developed approach which can
form the core of a political solution,'' Jehan Perera, director of
the Sri Lanka Peace Council, said. ``But to succeed there will be a
need for a total consensus among the political parties to start
with.''

Iraqi warhead tests indicate Baghdad cover-up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with comments from experts; CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A second round of tests on Iraqi missile
warheads did not provide further conclusive evidence that Iraq
loaded the deadly nerve agent VX into the warheads _ but it did
indicate that the Iraqis were trying to cover something up.
	   Despite lack of additional proof, U.N. and chemical weapons
experts from seven countries said Monday they were satisfied with
initial U.S. tests in April that showed the Iraqis had loaded VX
into warheads.
	   A French laboratory also found residue of a nerve agent on one
missile fragment they tested that could be from VX or sarin or
another agent called soman. French experts said the residue could
also originate from household detergents, but U.S. experts said
they weren't aware of such compounds having any commercial use.
	   The long-awaited results of the second round of tests by U.S.,
Swiss and French laboratories _ demanded by the Iraqis _ found
signs that the Iraqis had tried to clean up the missile warheads
between the initial U.S. tests in April and the subsequent tests in
June and July.
	   U.S., French and Swiss labs unexpectedly found the same residue
of a chemical compound used in decontamination on different samples
of warhead fragments. The residue wasn't found in the original
tests at a U.S. Army laboratory. And the chemical experts said in
the report that there was ``no obvious explanation'' why it was
missing in the initial U.S. test.
	   The report didn't suggest tampering, but it raised questions
about why the 20 missile warheads tested needed to be
decontaminated when the Iraqis claimed they had only been in
contact with alcohol. And alcohol is non-toxic, evaporates, and
doesn't need decontamination.
	   Independent experts assessing the report said the residues from
the decontamination compounds provide strong evidence that the
Iraqis were trying to get rid of something in the warheads.
	   ``Can you imagine the Iraqis going out and cleaning up a warhead
when something wasn't there? Good housekeeping is not something the
Iraqi military is noted for,'' said David Kay, the former chief
U.N. weapons inspector whose teams uncovered Iraq's clandestine
program to develop nuclear weapons.
	   ``I think that's the strongest possible evidence that something
was there,'' Kay, who now works on proliferation on
counter-terrorism issues for Washington-based Science Applications
International Corp, told The Associated Press.
	   Jonathan B. Tucker, director of the chemical and biological
weapons non-proliferation project at the Monterey Institute of
International Studies, said the new results ``indicate Iraq had
tampered with the material.''
	   ``It's not a smoking gun, but it's indicative that Iraq was
trying to cover something up,'' he said in a telephone interview.
	   Amy Smithson, senior associate at the Henry L. Stimson Center, a
Washington think tank on security issues, said ``Iraq's been caught
red-handed once again.''
	   ``The factual evidence from these samples will be very hard to
dispute,'' she said in an interview. ``This indicates that they
weaponized VX, which the Iraqis have consistently insisted they did
not do. The fact that residues from decontamination solutions were
found indicates that they were trying to cover that up.''
	   U.N. weapons inspectors charged with eliminating Iraq's nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons programs after the 1991 Gulf War
maintain that Baghdad has not made a full disclosure of its
chemical and biological weapons capability.
	   Iraq admitted after several years of denial that it had produced
3.9 tons of VX. But Iraq claims it was never able to produce enough
VX, or stabilize it sufficiently to load into missiles.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
weapons of mass destruction _ and the missiles to deliver them _
before the 15-member Security Council will lift economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.

Georgia's security minister resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia's security minister has quit, a
week after mutinous soldiers staged a one-day revolt against
President Eduard Shevardnadze.
	   Shevardnadze accepted the resignation of Security Minister
Dzhemal Gakhokidze on Monday, the Georgian presidential press
service said Tuesday.
	   Thirty-one people have been arrested in connection with the Oct.
19 revolt in western Georgia, although the leader, Akakiy Eliava,
remains at large.
	   Eliava is a military commander who supported the late Georgian
president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when
it gained independence in 1991, was ousted in early 1992 and fought
a short war in a bid to return to power. He died under mysterious
circumstances in 1994. His followers remain bitterly opposed to
Shevardnadze.

	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ A New Zealand radio station said
Tuesday it would provide nationwide air time to Hutu rebels who
kidnapped three tourists in the eastern Congo two months ago if it
would help secure their release.
	   Two Swedes and a New Zealander remain in the hands of Interhamwe
rebels, reportedly from Rwanda, out of a party of 11 abducted in a
mountain gorilla park 12 miles (20 kilometers) inside the
Democratic Republic of Congo-Uganda border in early August.
	   The party included seven Congolese _ two drivers, two rangers
and three baggage carriers.
	   Shortly after the kidnapping, a Canadian woman was released with
a message the rebels wanted read over the BBC World Service in
Africa in French, English and Swahili. Some versions of the message
were broadcast by the radio system.
	   Now Auckland-based Radio Pacific is sending its foreign
correspondent Paul Henry to the Congo to try to make contact with
the rebels holding the Western trio, who include New Zealander
Douglas Kear, 66, of Hamilton.
	   ``Even if it's a long shot, we're happy to help try and get them
out,'' Radio Pacific executive chairman Derek Lowe told The
Associated Press Tuesday.
	   Radio Pacific would give the rebels up to an hour of air time by
satellite phone.
	   ``If they are looking for exposure, we're perfectly happy to be
the conduit,'' Lowe said. ``If it helps release the Kiwis (New
Zealanders) and the others, that's great.''
	   Ugandan police sources said earlier they were unsure which group
was responsible for the abduction. The kidnappers had made no
demands except for the broadcast.
	   Latest reports say the rebels and their hostages were sighted in
a Congo forest last week.
	   A report in the Ugandan newspaper Sunday Vision at the weekend
quoted diplomats and local people as saying the number of Western
captives had risen to five, including two more men, one of whom was
wearing a religious collar.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A special envoy of the U.N.
secretary-general arrived Tuesday on an official visit to discuss
political and human rights issues with leaders of Myanmar's
military government.
	   Alvaro de Soto, an assistant U.N. secretary-general, will meet
with leaders of the ruling State Peace and Development Council
during his four-day stay, but it was not known if he would meet
with outspoken opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   It is de Soto's fifth visit as a U.N. envoy since 1995.
	   De Soto last visited Myanmar _ also known as Burma _ in January
in a failed effort to facilitate a dialogue between the junta and
Suu Kyi, leader of the National League for Democracy.
	   De Soto met Suu Kyi during his January visit, as well as the
council chairman, Gen. Than Shwe, and other government leaders.
	   Relations between the government and the opposition deteriorated
sharply afterward, with the military increasing its repression of
the pro-democracy movement and Suu Kyi's party increasing its
challenges to the government's legitimacy.
	   In August, Myanmar rejected Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
candidate to look into the military regime's treatment of Suu Kyi,
winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.
	   Annan had asked that Razali Ismail of Malaysia, former president
of the General Assembly, be allowed to make a quick trip after the
Myanmar government had repeatedly blocked Suu Kyi's attempts to
travel outside the capital to meet with members of her political
party.
	   Myanmar said there was no need for such a rushed trip.
	   The United States, among others, had sought Annan's
intervention.
	   De Soto was to meet Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw and Minister of
the Chairman's Office Brig. Gen. David Abel Tuesday afternoon, said
a Myanmar Foreign Ministry official.
	   He was scheduled to meet the influential secretary-one of the
junta, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, Wednesday.
	   The junta seized power in 1988 after violently suppressing
pro-democracy demonstrations. Suu Kyi's party won a landslide
victory in 1990 parliamentary elections, but the military refused
to yield power.
	   Western nations, including the United States, and private groups
such as Amnesty International say the junta is responsible for
substantial human rights abuses. The U.N. Human Rights Commission
also has reported abuses and sought to encourage governmental
reforms in Myanmar.

Police to seize children at anti-government rallies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mahathir comments, grafs 7-9; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police warned parents not to bring
their children to anti-government protests or risk losing custody
under child welfare laws, a news report said Tuesday.
	   After chaos and violence erupted at a huge street protest over
the weekend, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad accused rioters of
using women and children as ``shields'' to protect against police.
	   Yaacub Amin, head of the police department's Criminal
Investigation Department, said the tactic, if true, was illegal.
Citing the Child Protection Act, he said police at upcoming rallies
would not hesitate to seize children temporarily to ``protect''
them from their own parents.
	   ``There has been one too many cases where parents had brought
their children for illegal gatherings,'' Yaacub was quoted as
saying in the newspaper New Straits Times. ``This cannot go on, and
we have to put a stop to it right now.''
	   In weekly Saturday gatherings, thousands have taken to the
streets of a downtown Kuala Lumpur shopping district to demand
justice for jailed dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim and an end to
Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   A full-scale riot broke out for the first time in nearly three
decades over the weekend. Riot police fired tear gas and water
cannons at protesters inside a mosque, who retaliated by hurling
stones and bricks.
	   Mahathir denied Tuesday that police had provoked the violence,
an allegation made by Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, on Monday. He
blamed protesters for triggering the chaos to force his ouster,
citing May riots in Indonesia that ended the 32-year reign of
President Suharto.
	   ``Obviously the demonstration is a duplication of the
demonstration in Indonesia,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying by the
national news agency Bernama.
	   ``If the government is toppled, there will be no trial for
(Anwar) and then of course he will get away scot-free,'' Mahathir
said, adding police had been forced to tame unruly crowds.
	   Police have banned anti-government rallies but the crowds have
turned out defiantly, drawing a wider cross-section of Malaysians,
including businessmen, civil servants, students and housewives with
children.
	   More than 260 people were arrested Saturday. Many who appeared
to be innocent shoppers were dragged into police trucks. Before
firing tear gas and water cannons, laced with a stinging chemical,
police have warned women and children to leave the area.
	   Malaysia's leading human rights group, SUARAM, which has been
monitoring the rallies, said it had seen no sign of parents using
their children as protection.
	   ``I think the accusation is extremely unfounded,'' said
Elizabeth Wong, a SUARAM spokeswoman. ``This is a way for the
government not to get parents to come to demonstrations at all.''
	   Anti-government demonstrations were mostly unheard of in usually
docile Malaysia until Mahathir fired Anwar as deputy prime minister
and finance minister on Sept. 2.
	   Anwar was later arrested for leading protests, and now faces
trial starting Nov. 2 on 10 counts of homosexual practices and
corruption.
	   The government, increasingly worried by the swelling dissent,
has warned the public of laws limiting political activity. Under
existing laws, students can be expelled and civil servants fired
for anti-government rallying. Taxi drivers have been warned not to
discuss politics with passengers.

Lebed calls for restoration of vice president's post in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former national security adviser Alexander Lebed
called Tuesday for the restoration of the position of vice
president, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``If you have been unlucky with a wife once, that is no reason
to give up the institution of marriage,'' Lebed said.
	   The position of vice president was abolished when Russia revised
its constitution in 1993. The last vice president, Alexander
Rutskoi, led a rebellion against Yeltsin in the fall of that year
that failed and prompted the constitutional changes.
	   Lebed said the president should be in charge of foreign policy,
domestic affairs and security, the vice president in charge of the
regions and the prime minister the economy.
	   Lebed now is governor of the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, but
he is expected to run for president in the next elections in 2000.
He came third in the 1996 elections.
	   Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin also recently called
for the restoration of the vice president's job so that someone
could take over if President Boris Yeltsin's health continues to
deteriorate.

Singapore employers urge government to consider options to wage
</HEADLINE>
cuts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singapore employers coalition has urged the
government not to place the burden of its business cost-cutting
measures on workers, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   ``Employers feel that workers, including chief executive
officers, should not bear the brunt of cost-cutting,'' Singapore
National Employers Federation president Stephen Lee was quoted as
saying in The Straits Times.
	   ``That is why they also want non-wage costs cut. The government
must visibly demonstrate that they are working on bringing down the
non-wage costs,'' Lee added.
	   Tension has arisen recently between the employers federation and
the National Trades Union Congress, a government-dominated umbrella
organization representing hundreds of unions.
	   In a television interview aired Saturday, NTUC chief Lim Boon
Heng, who is also a Cabinet minister, criticized employers for not
doing enough to spread the message of imminent pay cuts.
	   ``Privately, employers are screaming and saying costs are out of
line, and that we need to cut them,'' Lim said. ``But publicly,
they have not been saying the same thing.''
	   Lim said this ``may lead workers to question why the labor
movement is pressing so hard for acceptance of cost-cutting
measures.''
	   Unions and workers' groups are controlled in this affluent
city-state, where strikes are unheard of and political and economic
stability are considered paramount.
	   Although not as damaged by the regional crisis as most other
Asian countries, Singapore has nevertheless suffered from the
downturn, and is likely headed for recession.
	   Rather than erect market controls or implement huge stimulus
packages like its neighbor Malaysia to the north, Singapore has
concentrated on regaining lost competitiveness through reducing the
cost of doing business.
	   In June, the government announced actions to aid businesses,
including property tax rebates, lower rentals, cuts in fees and
surcharges, increased government funding for some enterprises,
reduced port, telecommunication and electricity tariffs, and
accelerated spending for several large infrastructure projects.
	   But measures expected to be unveiled in November are certain to
be more severe. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said over the weekend
that wage cuts, for instance, are inevitable.
	   The employers federation has voiced its approval of some wage
cuts, but hopes for other substantial reductions in government
levies, rentals and other costs, the newspaper report said.

India accuses Pakistan of trying to capture glacial territory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES attribution. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Pakistan tried to capture territory on
an icy border battlefield but six of its troops were killed by
Indian forces who repulsed the attack, the Indian army said
Tuesday.
	   The army said in a statement that the fighting with mortars and
shells occurred Monday evening on the Siachen Glacier.
	   The glacier, some 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) north of New
Delhi, is more than 20,000 feet (6,000 meters) above sea level.
Both India and Pakistan claim Siachen, and skirmishes are common
across the frontier despite the severe conditions. Temperatures on
Siachen hover around minus 55 Celsius (minus 67 Fahrenheit), with
wind speeds of up to 100 kilometers (66 miles) per hour.
	   The Siachen dispute is among the items to be discussed next
month by Indian and Pakistani secretaries of defense, water and
power, police, commerce and culture. The talks aimed at normalizing
relations are part of a round that began earlier this month with
talks between the two countries' foreign secretaries.
	   The foreign secretaries' talks, which ended inconclusively with
promises of more meetings next year, were also preceded by fighting
on Siachen.

Government suspends 38 officials for eating away flood relief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Thirty-eight bureaucrats were suspended
Tuesday after being accused of siphoning off relief funds meant for
millions of people affected by India's worst flooding in decades, a
government minister said.
	   The 38 junior and middle-rank officials in the northern Uttar
Pradesh state government will be fired if the charges are
confirmed, officials said.
	   ``More suspensions will follow,'' state Relief Minister Ashok
Yadav told The Associated Press.
	   ``These are just the preliminary findings. We expect many more
officials to be found guilty,'' said Ashok Kumar, the top
bureaucrat in charge of relief.
	   The state government ordered an investigation in September, as
the flood waters began to recede, amid widespread charges that
millions of dollars and food meant to help victims of the
devastating floods had not reached the needy.
	   A government inquiry showed that substandard food was
distributed in large parts of the state, and many people named as
recipients of government aid did not exist.
	   State and federal officials spent a total of 3.5 billion rupees
(about dlrs 83 million) on flood relief in Uttar Pradesh.
	   The death toll from a month of relentless rain in August was
1,350 and nearly 12 million villagers were left homeless, according
to official figures.

Japan welcomes increased democracy, economic reform in Kyrgyzstan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan on Tuesday welcomed democratic and
free-market reforms in Kyrgyzstan in a joint statement signed by
the leaders of the two countries, the Foreign Ministry said.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and Kyrgyzstan President
Askar Akayev signed a document to promote economic, political and
cultural ties, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hiroki Tokunaga said.
	   While Japan praised reform in the Central Asian state,
Kyrgyzstan urged Japan to increase economic development aid to the
country so that it could accelerate the pace of political change
and market liberalization.
	   Japan stressed the need for political stability in Kyrgyzstan, a
former Soviet republic that borders China's northwestern Xinjiang
province, where Beijing is trying to quell Muslim separatists.
	   Japan also welcomed the World Trade Organization's decision this
month to give membership to Kyrgyzstan.
	   Akayev arrived Sunday in Japan for a three-day visit, which
included meetings with Obuchi, Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura and
Japanese businessmen.
	   Japan, one of the biggest investors in Central Asia, has given
Kyrgyzstan millions of dollars in development aid since 1991, when
the impoverished agricultural state gained independence from the
Soviet Union.

	   LEGASPI, Philippines (AP) _ Seven prisoners escaped from a jail
in the central Philippines in a motorcycle taxi after stabbing and
seriously injuring two guards, police said Tuesday.
	   Police said the escape took place late Sunday at the provincial
jail in the town of Sorsogon in Sorsogon province.
	   The prisoners used crude knives to stab the two guards in the
stomach and then escaped with the help of two of the prisoners'
wives, police said.
	   They took an automatic rifle and a handgun from the jail armory
before fleeing aboard the commandeered motorcycle taxi.
	   A search for the prisoners and the two women has been launched,
police said.

Hebron under curfew after killing of Jewish settler
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Tuesday enforced a
curfew in downtown Hebron in response to the slaying of a Jewish
settler, and as part of the crackdown entered a Palestinian
elementary school and ordered students to go home.
	   The curfew imposed Monday night marked the third time since
August that about 30,000 Palestinians in the Israeli-run sector of
the divided city are barred from leaving their homes.
	   In all, the residents of the downtown area, including 12,000
students, have spent more than three weeks under curfew since the
summer.
	   ``If anything happens, they (Israeli soldiers) punish all of
us,'' said Khalil Jaberi, 26, as he peered from his window at the
deserted streets below.
	   Jaberi said he had hoped that life would improve as a result of
the new Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement signed last week.
	   ``We thought that we could now go to Gaza, but we cannot even
leave our homes,'' said Jaberi, referring to a provision in the
accord for a new land route for Palestinians between the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
	   The latest tensions were triggered by Monday's slaying of Danny
Vargas, a 29-year-old security guard from the nearby Jewish
settlement of Kiryat Arba. Vargas was shot three times and was
dumped on a Hebron street.
	   The assailants, believed to be Palestinian militants, fled into
the Palestinian-run sector where Vargas' bloodstained car was found
shortly after the shooting.
	   Several hours after the killing, the body of a Palestinian,
65-year-old Mohammed Zalmouk, was discovered outside the Jewish
West Bank settlement of Itamar. Israeli police said they were
hunting for a suspect described as a young Israeli.
	   The violence is putting the Mideast agreement to its first test.
Israeli and Palestinian security forces cooperated closely in
trying to solve the Hebron killing. However, Israel's restrictions
in Hebron caused new bitterness among Palestinians.
	   As part of Israel's crackdown, the army sealed Hebron, barring
Palestinians from entering and leaving the city.
	   In the downtown area, soldiers erected checkpoints on all the
roads leading into the Palestinian-run sector and kept cars and
pedestrians out of the Israeli area.
	   Shortly before 8 a.m., two jeeps pulled up outside the Sider
Elementary School for girls which straddles the line between the
Israeli and Palestinian areas. Soldiers entered the school and told
the principal, Almaza Dufes, to ordered the students to go home.
Mrs. Dufes said some of the girls began crying, frightened by the
sight of soldiers in their school.
	   She said she protested the closure order, noting that during the
two previous periods of curfew, the school was allowed to operate.
However, the soldiers did not relent, and the girls were sent home.

China to shorten military service for draftees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China said Tuesday it will shorten military
service for draftees to two years from three for its army and four
in the air force and navy as part of modernization plans.
	   The plan was included in legislation submitted to the National
People's Congress, the Chinese legislature, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported. The congress routinely approves legislation
proposed by the government.
	   The 3 million-member People's Liberation Army, which includes
air and sea forces, is in the midst of a sweeping effort to reduce
its ranks by 500,000 over the next three years and upgrade its
military technology.
	   Military leaders want to expand the volunteer portion of their
forces to 35 percent by 2000, from 18 percent today.
	   ``Many young people old enough to join the army hesitate because
of the long enlistment period,'' Xinhua quoted Yu Yongbo, a member
of the Central Military Commission, as saying.
	   China has spent heavily to build up capabilities in submarines,
cruise missiles and other advanced weapons, turning away from its
traditional tactic of relying on overwhelming numbers of troops.
	   The proposed law would eliminate extended military service,
which can add one to two years in uniform for some draftees.
	   It also includes changes in regulations for volunteers,
provisions for the families of draftees and arrangements for
veterans, Xinhua said.

Indonesia stands by contract with U.S. miner despite controversy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with minister's comments; single
name for Suharto correct, graf 5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia intends to honor its
contract with a big U.S. gold mining company despite allegations of
corruption, Energy Minister Kuntoro Mangusubroto said Tuesday.
	   ``We're honoring the contract,'' Kuntoro told reporters.
	   Freeport Indonesia, a unit of New Orleans-based Freeport-McMoran
Copper and Gold Inc., operates the world's single largest copper
and gold deposit mine in mineral-rich Irian Jaya, on the western
half of New Guinea.
	   Several legislators recently have called for a review of
Freeport's contract.
	   The company has long been shrouded in controversy due to its
close ties with the Indonesian government and perceived links with
former President Suharto, who quit in May after riots and protests
forced him to end 32 authoritarian years in power.
	   Controversy surrounding Freeport increased last month when
American college professor Jeffrey Winters alleged the involvement
of Indonesian senior economic minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita in a
1991 share transaction between Freeport and an Indonesian
conglomerate, the Bakrie group.
	   The deal led to the renewal of Freeport's operating contract
with the Indonesian government that year.
	   Ginandjar, who was mines and energy minister at the time, has
rejected the allegations and says the deal was aboveboard.
	   The minister, who is now one of Indonesia's powerful
coordinating ministers, has submitted information and files
concerning the extension of Freeport's contract of work to
Indonesia's attorney general.
	   Energy Minister Kuntoro declined to comment directly on the
allegations against Ginandjar.
	   Meanwhile, the attorney general's office has launched an
investigation into the circumstances surrounding the sale of the
stake to Bakrie, while a separate parliamentary group is also
looking into the issue.
	   On Tuesday, investigators at the attorney general's office
questioned Bakrie chairman Aburizal Bakrie.
	   The attorney general also intends to question Freeport chairman
James Moffet.
	   Freeport has said the contract isn't negotiable. Both it and
Bakrie have denied any wrongdoing.
	   Freeport has been criticized for years by international and
Indonesian groups for allegedly mistreating indigenous peoples and
the environment, charges the company vehemently denies.

Yeltsin's weak health forces cancellation of Austrian trip
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin checking into sanatorium, Primakov to
brief European leaders on economic plan. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin checked into a sanatorium Tuesday, a
day after doctors ordered him to cancel yet another foreign trip
because of high blood pressure and extreme fatigue.
	   Yeltsin's announcement Monday that he would not make the one-day
trip to Austria fueled speculation about his ability to stay in
office and guide Russia through its worst economic crisis in the
post-Soviet era.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov went to Vienna in Yeltsin's
place to meet with European Union leaders and international
lenders.
	   Yeltsin's office said Monday the 67-year-old Russian leader was
suffering from an ``asthenic condition.'' Asthenia refers to a lack
of physical strength.
	   Yeltsin's blood pressure was also unstable and doctors
recommended a vacation, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said.
	   On Tuesday, Yeltsin checked into the Barvikha sanatorium near
Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Yakushkin.
Yeltsin has stayed there in the past, including when he was
recovering from multiple heart bypass surgery in 1996.
	   ``This is perhaps the first time recently when the president has
listened to his doctors' advice,'' Yeltsin aid Oleg Sysuyev said
Monday on the Russian TV program ``Hero of the Day.''
	   ``The president is not ill enough to be considered incapable of
working,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin's recent ailments have heightened calls for his
resignation. If he were to step down _ though he insists he won't _
he would be replaced by Primakov, who would be required to call new
elections within three months.
	   Primakov has been prime minister for only six weeks and has yet
to produce his own blueprint to deal with the country's deep-rooted
economic problems. But he is widely respected by all political
factions and is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when
Yeltsin has receded into the background.
	   Primakov held talks with Yeltsin at the president's Gorky-9
country residence outside of Moscow before leaving for Vienna,
Yeltsin's press service said.
	   Yeltsin authorized him to tell European Union officials about
the government's plan to cope with the latest economic crisis,
Yakushkin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   For several months now, Yeltsin has rarely put in full days at
the Kremlin, spending most of his time at his country residences.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems, But the
president and his doctors insist that he'll serve out the rest of
his term, set to end in the summer of 2000, and deny he has
crippling health problems.
	   Still, Yeltsin clearly lacks the energy he displayed in his
early years in office.
	   Potential candidates in the 2000 presidential race have already
begun an informal campaign to replace Yeltsin. Leading contenders
include Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov and Alexander Lebed, a former general and now governor of
a vast Siberian region.
	   Russian newspapers have speculated that Yeltsin is afflicted
with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, but their reports are
based simply on his public appearances, not on medical
examinations.
	   Yeltsin cannot point to any major accomplishments since he was
re-elected in 1996, yet many warn his resignation would trigger a
political crisis on top of Russia's economic turmoil.
	   Yeltsin was forced to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier
this month because of a respiratory infection. He has already
canceled a visit to Malaysia that was planned for next month, but a
visit to India in December was still on his schedule.

Bomb planted in police post injures four
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A powerful bomb stashed inside a small
police post outside the southern Sindh provincial legislature
exploded on Tuesday, wounding four people, police said.
	   The police post was empty, but four passers by were wounded from
flying shrapnel.
	   Although no one took responsibility for the explosion, police
fear it is part of the ongoing feud between rival factions of an
ethnic group, the Muttaheda Qami Movement.
	   Factional fighting has terrorized residents of Karachi, the
Sindh provincial capital.
	   Tuesday's explosion frightened shop keepers in the area.
	   ``The explosion was very powerful,'' Talat Aslam an eyewitness
said. ``I can still smell the smoke.''
	   Since the beginning of the year factional fighting has left as
many as 1,000 people dead, including several police officers.
	   The violence in Karachi has prompted Prime Minister Nawaz sharif
to deploy another 10,000 policemen to patrol the troubled streets.
Currently 28,000 policemen are deployed in Karachi along with
thousands of paramilitary Rangers.
	   The MQM represents Indian Muslims who settled in Pakistan after
the British left the Asian subcontinent in 1947. The rivalry is
largely a territorial war with both factions trying to impose their
control over parts of Pakistan's largest city of Karachi, teeming
with 14 million people.

Japanese stocks lower, dollar rises in Tokyo

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese share prices fell for a third consecutive
day Tuesday, pulled lower by persistent concerns over the
effectiveness of government measures to pull Japan out of
recession. The dollar rose slightly against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average moved in and out of
negative territory before finally closing down 22.78 points, or
0.16 percent, at 13,820.68. On Monday, the average had lost 301.24
points, or 2.13 percent.
	   ``There are no new incentives to make investors buy as the
market has factored in measures to stabilize the financial system
and the short covering of bank shares has been completed,'' said
Masatoshi Sato, manager of investor information group at Kankaku
Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined 5.76 points, or
0.55 percent, to 1,042.98. It had fallen 19.41 points, or 1.81
percent, the previous day.
	   Declines outnumbered advances 792 to 342 on the exchange's first
section, with 140 issues closing unchanged. An estimated 350
million shares changed hands, up from 319 million the previous day.
	   The market rose in early trading after Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi instructed his Cabinet to compile a package of economic
stimulus measures by Nov. 16. The new spending package, expected to
total at least 10 trillion yen (dlrs 84 billion), will likely form
the core of another supplementary budget, the third such
appropriation measure so far this year.
	   But the gain proved short-lived amid uncertainty about details
of the plan and concern it will tilt heavily toward public works
spending instead of tax cuts.
	   ``We want to see more specifics,'' said Futoshi Yoshimura, joint
head of dealing at Schroder Securities Japan Ltd.'s equity trading
department.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar rose moderately against the yen as
expectations that the dollar will continue to strengthen against
other major currencies offset bouts of profit-taking.
	   The dollar bought 119.36 yen in late afternoon, up 0.34 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its New York rate of 119.10 yen
in late trading overnight.
	   The U.S. currency improved upon gains in New York triggered by
Italy's decision to cut interest rates, but moves by some Tokyo
dealers to lock in recent gains limited its climb.
	   ``The market is biding its time, and the only way we'll get to
120 yen is in fits and starts,'' said Takeo Suzuki, deputy foreign
exchange manager in the Tokyo office of Nomura Trust and Banking.
	   In New York, the dollar had risen against the yen and many
European currencies after the long-awaited move by the Bank of
Italy, which was expected to pave the way for more rate cuts in
Europe.
	   The dollar had dipped in early Tokyo trading on rumors that the
Bank of China made offers to sell the U.S. currency at the 119 yen
level, traders said.
	   It traded as low as 118.87 and as high as 119.65.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.900 percent from Monday's finish of 0.870 percent,
driving its price down to 107.98 yen from 108.27 yen.

	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ A car bomb exploded in this southern
Lebanese port Tuesday, seriously injuring a leader of the Islamic
Jihad militant group and three other persons, security officials
said.
	   Mahmoud Majzoub, his wife Mona, their 4-year-old son and an
unidentified man were in stable condition in hospital.
	   The blast took place at 9 a.m. local time (0700 GMT) on Sidon's
eastern highway, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing.
	   Islamic Jihad is a hard-line Palestine group with a number of
followers in the Palestinian refugee camps outside Sidon. In 1995
its leader, Fathi Shekaki, was gunned down outside a hotel in Malta
in an assassination widely blamed on Israeli agents.
	   A spokesman for Jihad's headquarters in Damascus told The
Associated Press that the movement would issue a statement about
the bombing later Tuesday.
	   Sidon has seen a spate of shootings in the past three months in
which the victims were often liquor store owners. On Sunday two
policemen were shot dead by a gunman on a motorbike. Security
officials believe Muslim fundamentalist groups, seeking a ban on
alcohol, could be behind the attacks.

Indonesian oil company probes deal involving ex-leader's son
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Corruption Claim &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ As part of an anti-corruption drive,
state energy company PT Pertamina is investigating a deal through
which two foreign oil companies allegedly bought a stake in a gas
project from a son of former President Suharto, a report said
Tuesday.
	   The official Antara news agency said Pertamina is investigating
the purchase by Atlantic Richfield Indonesia Inc. and British
Petroleum PLC because of speculation that Suharto's second son,
Bambang Trihatmodjo, got the stake in East Java's Kangean gas block
for free but has now profited by selling it.
	   Atlantic Richfield Indonesia is a unit of U.S.-based Atlantic
Richfield, or Arco.
	   Antara reported that Pertamina is looking into allegations that
the two foreign companies bought the 10 percent stake from PT
Bimantara Samudra, owned by Bambang, without informing Pertamina.
	   ``We're investigating whether Arco and British Petroleum have
already taken over the 10 percent share of Bambang's company in the
block,'' Antara quoted Pertamina spokesman Sidik Nitikusuma as
saying.
	   Arco Indonesia manager Leon Codron declined to comment on the
matter, saying it was up to Pertamina to do so. Officials of
Pertamina and BP couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
	   Suharto stepped down in May after riots and protests forced him
to end 32 years in power.
	   Critics of the former leader accuse him of enriching his family
during his time in office. His six children all have built huge
business empires.
	   However, Suharto, who is at the center of a corruption
investigation, has admitted no wrongdoing.
	   Since his departure, many companies and the government itself
have ended many business arrangements linked to the Suharto clan.
	   Arco currently holds a 54 percent stake in the Kangean block,
while BP has 36 percent and Bimantara Dutasamudra 10 percent.
	   After the purchasing deal, Arco will hold a 60 percent stake in
the block and BP 40 percent, Antara said.
	   The Kangean block produces 330 million cubic meters of gas per
day.
	   Pertamina said recently it has identified 159 projects within
the company that were allegedly granted because of corruption and
nepotism under the Suharto regime.
	   Pertamina has long been associated with Suharto's family and
cronies who are believed to have benefited handsomely from
Indonesia's lucrative oil and gas reserves during the former
president's rule.
	   Antara said Pertamina would recommend that the majority
shareholders of other production-sharing contracts also buy out
their minority shareholders if the contracts are perceived as being
corrupt.
	   According to the report, Pertamina will recommend that Unocal
Corp. take over a stake in the offshore Ganal field in East
Kalimantan, owned by close Suharto associate Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan
through his company PT Nusamba Kaltim Pratama.

Yeltsin's weak health forces cancellation of Austrian trip
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with press secretary saying Yeltsin's stay will depend
on how treatment schedule. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin checked into a sanatorium Tuesday, a
day after doctors ordered him to cancel yet another foreign trip
because of high blood pressure and extreme fatigue.
	   Yeltsin's announcement Monday that he would not make the one-day
trip to Austria fueled speculation about his ability to stay in
office and guide Russia through its worst economic crisis in the
post-Soviet era.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov went to Vienna in Yeltsin's
place to meet with European Union leaders and international
lenders.
	   Yeltsin's office said Monday the 67-year-old Russian leader was
suffering from an ``asthenic condition.'' Asthenia refers to a lack
of physical strength.
	   Yeltsin's blood pressure was also unstable and doctors
recommended a vacation, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said.
	   On Tuesday, Yeltsin checked into the Barvikha sanatorium near
Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Yakushkin.
Yeltsin has stayed there in the past, including when he was
recovering from multiple heart bypass surgery in 1996.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin would undergo ``a course of restoration
treatment,'' Interfax reported. The length of his stay depends on
the treatment scheduled, he said, without elaborating.
	   ``This is perhaps the first time recently when the president has
listened to his doctors' advice,'' Yeltsin aid Oleg Sysuyev said
Monday on the Russian TV program ``Hero of the Day.''
	   ``The president is not ill enough to be considered incapable of
working,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin's recent ailments have heightened calls for his
resignation. If he were to step down _ though he insists he won't _
he would be replaced by Primakov, who would be required to call new
elections within three months.
	   Primakov has been prime minister for only six weeks and has yet
to produce his own blueprint to deal with the country's deep-rooted
economic problems. But he is widely respected by all political
factions and is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when
Yeltsin has receded into the background.
	   Primakov held talks with Yeltsin at the president's Gorky-9
country residence outside of Moscow before leaving for Vienna,
Yeltsin's press service said.
	   Yeltsin authorized him to tell European Union officials about
the government's plan to cope with the latest economic crisis,
Yakushkin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   For several months now, Yeltsin has rarely put in full days at
the Kremlin, spending most of his time at his country residences.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems, But the
president and his doctors insist that he'll serve out the rest of
his term, set to end in the summer of 2000, and deny he has
crippling health problems.
	   Still, Yeltsin clearly lacks the energy he displayed in his
early years in office.
	   Potential candidates in the 2000 presidential race have already
begun an informal campaign to replace Yeltsin. Leading contenders
include Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov and Alexander Lebed, a former general and now governor of
a vast Siberian region.
	   Russian newspapers have speculated that Yeltsin is afflicted
with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, but their reports are
based simply on his public appearances, not on medical
examinations.
	   Yeltsin cannot point to any major accomplishments since he was
re-elected in 1996, yet many warn his resignation would trigger a
political crisis on top of Russia's economic turmoil.
	   Yeltsin was forced to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier
this month because of a respiratory infection. He has already
canceled a visit to Malaysia that was planned for next month, but a
visit to India in December was still on his schedule.

Chinese president plans to visit Russia in November
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin will visit Moscow
in November despite the poor health of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, a Russian lawmaker said Tuesday.
	   Trips by Jiang to Russia and Japan were initially scheduled for
September but were postponed because of devastating floods in
China. Jiang now will visit Russia Nov. 22-25 and then go to Japan,
the Russian news agency ITAR-Tass reported.
	   He will hold an informal meeting with Yeltsin and also meet with
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Tass said.
	   The speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, Gennady
Seleznyov, told reporters after meeting with Jiang on Tuesday that
the Chinese president had no plans to postpone his Russia trip
again.
	   Seleznyov said China's relations with Russia were good, but
trade ties needed to improve.
	   ``We're old friends. We have no serious contradictions or
misunderstandings,'' he said. He added that he and a delegation of
lawmakers from Russia's most influential political parties stressed
the need for better economic relations.
	   Once Cold War rivals for the allegiances of the socialist world,
China and Russia have improved relations over the past decade.
	   China has become a major trading partner and a leading customer
for Russia's struggling defense industry. Russia views its
relations with China as a counterbalance to what it sees as U.S.
dominance in world affairs.
	   Seleznyov, who also met with legislative chairman Li Peng, who
is No. 2 in the Chinese Communist Party hierarchy, said China's
leaders did not offer any concrete measures to help Russia out of
its economic turmoil. Seleznyov said his delegation stressed the
need to move ahead with present projects.
	   Russia has signed letters of intent to send gas and electricity
to China, but the projects are bogged down, Seleznyov said.
	   Seleznyov, a Communist and speaker of the State Duma, praised
China's economic reforms, but said Russia has a different political
system and history and must find its own way.
	   Seleznyov said he assured Li that he had opposed a private visit
to Taiwan last week by Russian ultranationalist Vladimir
Zhirinovsky. China regards Taiwan as a rebel province to be
isolated diplomatically.

Hebron under curfew after killing of Jewish settler
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Tuesday enforced a
curfew in downtown Hebron in response to the slaying of a Jewish
settler, and as part of the crackdown entered a Palestinian
elementary school and ordered students to go home.
	   The curfew imposed on Monday night marked the third time since
August that about 30,000 Palestinians in the Israeli-run sector of
the divided city were barred from leaving their homes.
	   In all, the residents of the downtown area, including 12,000
students, have spent more than three weeks under curfew since the
summer.
	   ``If anything happens, they (Israeli soldiers) punish all of
us,'' said Khalil Jaberi, 26, as he peered from his window at the
deserted streets below.
	   Jaberi said he had hoped that life would improve as a result of
the new Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement signed last week.
	   ``We thought that we could now go to Gaza, but we cannot even
leave our homes,'' said Jaberi, referring to a provision in the
accord for a new land route for Palestinians between the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
	   The latest tensions were triggered by Monday's slaying of Danny
Vargas, a 29-year-old security guard from the nearby Jewish
settlement of Kiryat Arba. Vargas was shot three times and was
dumped on a Hebron street.
	   The assailants, believed to be Palestinian militants, fled into
the Palestinian-run sector where Vargas' bloodstained car was found
shortly after the shooting.
	   Several hours after the killing, the body of a Palestinian,
65-year-old Mohammed Zalmouk, was discovered outside the Jewish
West Bank settlement of Itamar. Israeli police said they were
hunting for a suspect described as a young Israeli.
	   The violence is putting the Mideast agreement to its first test.
Israeli and Palestinian security forces cooperated closely in
trying to solve the Hebron killing. However, Israel's restrictions
in Hebron caused new bitterness among Palestinians.
	   As part of Israel's crackdown, the army sealed Hebron, barring
Palestinians from entering and leaving the city.
	   In the downtown area, soldiers erected checkpoints on all the
roads leading into the Palestinian-run sector and kept cars and
pedestrians out of the Israeli area.
	   Shortly before 8 a.m., two jeeps pulled up outside the Sider
Elementary School for girls which straddles the line between the
Israeli and Palestinian areas. Soldiers entered the school and told
the principal, Almaza Dufes, to order the students to go home. Mrs.
Dufes said some of the girls began crying, frightened by the sight
of soldiers in their school.
	   She said she protested the closure order, noting that during the
two previous periods of curfew, the school was allowed to operate.
However, the soldiers did not relent, and the girls were sent home.

Report advocates sweeping diplomatic reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE GEDDA &QC; 
 &UR; Assiciated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ To meet the challenges of the information age,
the United States can no longer afford unqualified ``political
ambassadors'' and should subject prospective appointees to the same
rigorous scrutiny that Supreme Court nominees receive.
	   This is one of a number of recommendations contained in a new
report that warns that U.S. diplomacy is threatened with
irrelevance unless it carries out revolutionary changes.
	   The study, titled ``Reinventing Diplomacy in the Information
Age,'' recommends sweeping changes in every aspect of the nation's
diplomatic establishment.
	   It was produced by a 63-member panel assembled by the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a local private research
group.
	   ``Failure to respond to the imperatives of change threatens
America's security and prosperity as well as its respect for
humanity,'' the study says.
	   ``American diplomacy must be guided by coherence, capability,
discipline and agility. It must be characterized by openness and
permeability. It must change now.''
	   The report takes aim at political ambassadors appointed solely
for their political ties to the party in power.
	   ``The fault is not with political ambassadors per se,'' the
report said, ``but with political ambassadors who lack the
experience and expertise for representing the United States. There
should be no room for them in America's diplomatic service.''
	   Stressing the need for reforms the United States needs to remain
effectively engaged internationally, the report says:
	   ``At a time when a coffee announcement in Brazil can shake up
financial markets in minutes, when secret preparations of a nuclear
explosion in India can instantaneously change the international
landscape, and when terrorists crossing borders in Afghanistan can
threaten Americans thousands of miles away, the United States must
have a modern foreign policy apparatus that can meet a vast array
of unexpected challenges.''
	   Specifically, the study says:
	   _Ending the culture of secrecy and exclusivity is a requirement
for developing a collaborative relationship with the public.
	   _The hierarchical model of the past should be replaced by
distributed decision-making, delegated authority and bureaucratic
streamlining.
	   _Public diplomacy must be moved from the sidelines to the core
of diplomacy.
	   _To ensure American competitiveness in the global economy,
greater attention must be focused on commercial diplomacy.

China detains democracy activists in crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 11 grafs to UPDATE with other dissidents detained,
missing, official comment &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ One of China's most prominent democracy
activists, his associate and as many as four other dissidents were
reported detained or missing Tuesday in a police crackdown just
weeks after China signed a key human rights treaty.
	   Police took veteran campaigner Xu Wenli away from his Beijing
home Tuesday morning, blocking his plan to set off on a
cross-country trip to protest the harassment of another dissident,
Xu's wife said.
	   Police also detained Xu's associate, Zhang Hui, and searched
Xu's home for two hours, confiscating a fax machine, papers,
magazines and photos, said Xu's wife, He Xintong.
	   She said the detentions demonstrated that authorities have no
intention of relaxing their grip despite China's Oct. 5 signing of
a U.N. human rights treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights.
	   ``This is their real face,'' she said in an interview. ``The
Communist Party says one thing but does another.''
	   Zhou Guoqiang, a dissident who planned to join Xu on his trip
Tuesday to eastern Shandong province, set off for Xu's house but
was not heard from again, said his wife, Wang Hui. She surmised
that he had been detained.
	   Xu's wife said she also had no news of Cha Jianguo and Wang
Zhixin, two of Xu's friends who planned to make their own way to
Shandong. They did not phone Xu's wife as planned, which ``may mean
they have run into trouble,'' she said.
	   Another dissident, Sha Yuguang, also was taken away from his
Beijing home Tuesday, although he was not planning to travel to
Shandong, a Hong Kong-based dissident monitoring group said.
	   A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said he was
unaware of the detentions. But he said China signed the U.N. pact
on civil and political rights to safeguard citizens' rights, and
remained determined to do so.
	   On Monday, before his detention, Xu said he and as many as 30
dissidents from Beijing and elsewhere in the country were going to
Shandong's Dongping County, some 450 kilometers (280 miles) south
of Beijing, to protest the harassment of fellow activist Xie
Wanjun.
	   Xie was detained last month and held for 15 days for attempting
to file an application with the authorities to set up an opposition
group, the China Democracy Party.
	   Since July, dissidents have tried to register branches of the
party in at least nine provinces and major cities, challenging a
virtual 49-year ban on organized opposition to the ruling Communist
Party.
	   Authorities have rejected all the applications and detained at
least 20 dissidents, mostly for short periods of time.
	   After his release, Xie was ordered to move out of his home by
Nov. 1 and his wife was sacked from her job as a teacher. Xie
accused police of forcing his former employer to evict him from his
home.
	   In a telephone call Monday, Xie also said his home's electricity
and telephone had been cut off, said Xu's wife.
	   ``It's too much,'' she said.
	   Police sought repeatedly in recent days to dissuade Xu from
making the trip. Xu said he would call it off if Xie's wife got her
job back, and if they were allowed to keep their home, said Xu's
wife.
	   With many other dissidents exiled abroad, Xu, 56, is one of the
most prominent democracy campaigners left in China. That makes him
a frequent target for police harassment.
	   His activism dates back to the Democracy Wall protest movement
of the late 1970s. Xu was arrested and freed in 1993 after serving
all but three years of a 15-year sentence, much of it in solitary
confinement.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic, facing
a NATO deadline Tuesday, has made a significant last-minute
pullback of his military and police forces in Kosovo in order to
avert NATO airstrikes.
	   International observers were out in force Tuesday in the
majority Albanian province to see whether the pullback is genuine.
U.S. officials in Washington say the Clinton administration wants
to make sure of that before declaring that Milosevic had satisfied
the terms of the deal he accepted to end the crisis.
	   ``We want to make sure the movements are a real withdrawal and
not a reconfiguration (of forces),'' said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
	   ``They're going down to the wire,'' said Shaun Byrnes, head of
the American section of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission,
which has been monitoring the situation since July. ``It's been the
pattern.''
	   Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 have been driven from
their homes in seven months of fighting since Milosevic launched a
crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and
most want independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The 16-nation NATO alliance has threatened to launch airstrikes
unless Milosevic halts his crackdown and cuts his forces to levels
in place before the conflict began in February.
	   Convoys of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks carrying
Yugoslav troops and police departed several areas ahead of the 1900
gmt deadline for compliance in this southern province.
	   According to observers, the forces were headed to their barracks
or back to Serbia.
	   ``They need to pull more people out of Kosovo to satisfy the
agreement,'' Byrnes said at the end of a strenuous day of
patrolling and observing Monday. He said observers will be out in
force Tuesday to see whether Milosevic is complying.
	   The observer mission is the spearhead of what will become up to
2,000 ``ground verifiers'' under the command of the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Kosovo's Serb governor, Veljko Odalovic, thanked the police for
``bringing peace to Kosovo'' and pledged the province will be
defended from ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' with or without the
police.
	   In Kosovo's central Drenica region on Monday, tanks withdrew
from roadside positions where they had dug in since Oct. 18.
Several police checkpoints were vacant, including one in Malisevo _
scene of the latest fighting. All that remained was a tattered
Serbian flag hung over a pile of bricks.
	   At another checkpoint, in Dragobilje, which was occupied by
heavily armed Serb police a few days earlier, a uniformed ethnic
Albanian guerrilla stood holding an automatic rifle.
	   The real test of the pullback will be if refugees begin
returning to their homes. Most say they won't go home until Serb
police leave their villages. So far, returns have been a trickle.
	   A NATO source in Brussels, Belgium, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the alliance's ambassadors probably would wait
until shortly before the deadline to declare whether Milosevic met
the conditions.
	   He said NATO was still prepared to use military force if
necessary. The deadline has already been extended once since
Milosevic agreed to the peace plan.
	   NATO and the U.N. Security Council have also demanded that
Milosevic allows international organizations to deliver
humanitarian aid to the Kosovo refugees without interference.

Genocide case a desperate cry for recognition, say Aboriginal
</HEADLINE>
leaders &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Single name for Wadjularbinna is correct &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Soft-spoken and gray-haired,
Aboriginal elder Wadjularbinna said Tuesday her claim that
Australia's political leaders are guilty of genocide is ``a
desperate last stand'' for recognition of her people's plight.
	   Wadjularbinna and other Aboriginal elders have made the claim in
a case before Judge Ken Crispin in the Supreme Court of the
Australian Capital Territory.
	   The Aborigines have asked the judge to issue summons alleging
the crime of genocide against virtually all of Australia's federal
legislators. They have named Prime Minister John Howard, his deputy
Tim Fischer and Tasmanian independent legislator Brian Harradine in
particular.
	   A judgment is expected before the end of the year.
	   Wadjularbinna readily admits that the genocide charge is a
desperate tactic, perhaps reflecting the belief of many white
lawyers that the case has no chance of success.
	   ``I am old, and it is a desperate last stand,'' Wadjularbinna
said Tuesday at an ``anti-genocide'' forum on the lawns of
Australia's old and now disused Parliament House.
	   ``Everything is going from bad to worse.''
	   Official statistics show Aborigines, who make up less than 2
percent of Australia's mostly white population of some 18.7
million, die younger than other Australians.
	   They are sicker, live in poverty more often and suffer higher
rates of disease and alcoholism, statistics show. Many blame the
problems on a deep sense of dispossession and alienation.
	   ``White people see land as a commodity, real estate that can be
bought and sold,'' Wadjularbinna said. ``But when the last river is
polluted, black and white people will go down together.''
	   When he was re-elected on Oct. 3, Howard nominated ``true
reconciliation'' between Australia's about 350,000 indigenous
people and the non-indigenous majority as a goal for his
government's second term.
	   Relations between Howard and Aborigines soured after the
government passed legislation restricting indigenous land rights,
and after Howard refused to apologize on behalf of the nation for
past policies that allowed thousands of Aborigines to be separated
from their families as children and placed in welfare because of
their race.
	   Harradine played a crucial role in the land rights legislation,
giving the government his vote in the Senate, where Howard's
conservative coalition does not have a majority.
	   Wadjularbinna said she wants Aboriginal and other Australians to
``walk hand in hand'' in future, but this cannot happen without
recognition of Aborigines' plight.
	   Wadjularbinna said that when she goes to meet her creator, she
wants to tell him that she has done all she can to win recognition
for her people.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese vehicle production dropped 9.7 percent in
September, the 12th straight month of decline, reflecting a slump
in demand both at home and elsewhere in Asia, a major auto group
said Tuesday.
	   Output in Japan dropped to 842,997 cars, trucks and buses last
month, helping drag down overall production for the first half of
the fiscal year ending in March by 12.1 percent to 4.74 million
vehicles, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said.
	   Passenger car output in September fell 6.4 percent from a year
earlier to 672,787, while truck production sank 21.4 percent to
165,171, the association said. The number of buses made rose 1.3
percent to 5,039, it added.
	   By manufacturer, Toyota Motor Corp.'s production fell 0.9
percent from a year earlier to 289,461 vehicles in September and
output at Honda Motor Co. declined 8.3 percent to 106,106.
	   Bucking the industry trend, Nissan Motor Co. managed a 0.8
percent gain to 147,361 vehicles and Mazda Motor Corp. production
rose 1.8 percent to 76,207.
	   While official figures will not be available until later this
month, the auto manufacturer's group estimated Japanese vehicle
exports fell 3 percent in September.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singapore employers coalition has urged the
government not to place the burden of its business cost-cutting
measures on workers, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   ``Employers feel that workers, including chief executive
officers, should not bear the brunt of cost-cutting,'' Singapore
National Employers Federation president Stephen Lee was quoted as
saying in The Straits Times.
	   ``That is why they also want non-wage costs cut. The government
must visibly demonstrate that they are working on bringing down the
non-wage costs,'' Lee added.
	   Tension has arisen recently between the employers federation and
the National Trades Union Congress, a government-dominated umbrella
organization representing hundreds of unions.
	   In a television interview aired Saturday, NTUC chief Lim Boon
Heng, who is also a Cabinet minister, criticized employers for not
doing enough to spread the message of imminent pay cuts.
	   ``Privately, employers are screaming and saying costs are out of
line, and that we need to cut them,'' Lim said. ``But publicly,
they have not been saying the same thing.''

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Coca-Cola Co. will announce the
opening of new bottling plants in the Philippines and China on
Wednesday, a spokesman for the U.S. soft-drink giant said.
	   Bobby Manzano, communications manager for Coca-Cola Export
Corp., said the company will announce the building of a new plant
in the southern Philippine city of Bacolod.
	   Although Manzano said the plant will replace an older facility
in the city, he noted ``it's a major investment (in) a time of
crisis.''
	   Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc. now has 21 plants throughout
the country.
	   Manzano said Coca-Cola will also announce a new plant in China,
but did not provide details on that project.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi instructed his
Cabinet on Tuesday to work toward compiling a new package of
government spending designed to boost Japan's sagging economy, a
spokesman said.
	   The Cabinet will meet next week to review proposed stimulus
measures and expects to reach a final decision on the scope of the
package by Nov. 16, said a spokesman for the prime minister's
office, who declined to be named.
	   The move comes in a bid to prevent Japan's economy from
shrinking for a third consecutive year and to fulfill Obuchi's
pledge to engineer a recovery within two years.
	   But many economists say prospects appear slim for a quick
rebound.
	   The latest sign of stagnation came Tuesday when the government
announced the unemployment rate was unchanged at a record 4.3
percent in September even as the overall size of the work force
shrank for an eighth straight month.
	   The Cabinet's latest public works spending package, expected to
total at least 10 trillion yen (dlrs 84 billion), will likely form
the core of a new supplementary budget, the third such
appropriation measure so far this year.
	   The new budget will also include at least 7 trillion yen (dlrs
58.8 billion) in tax cuts, the Nihon Keizai business daily reported
Tuesday.
	   Japan officially estimates gross domestic product will contract
by 1.8 percent for the current fiscal year, which ends next March.
The Japanese economy shrank 0.7 percent last year.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Plans to privatize Indonesia's
state-owned steel manufacturer PT Krakatau Steel will be delayed
until 2000 because of depressed steel prices, a local newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted the steel company's president Sutrisno
as saying that the privatization plan, originally scheduled for
this fiscal year, will be delayed.
	   The report cited plunging steel prices as the main cause.
	   Prices have reached a record low of dlrs 200 per ton from
between dlrs 310 and dlrs 370 per ton early last year.
	   Krakatau Steel is among 12 state-owned enterprises tagged for
privatization this fiscal year to raise funds to plug the
government's large budget deficit.
	   The government has also postponed a plan to privatize the
domestic telecommunication provider PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia,
citing unfavorable market conditions.
	   The sale of state assets is regarded as a major part of an
economic rescue program sponsored by the International Monetary
Fund to help Indonesia overcome its worst financial crisis in 30
years.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's jobless rate stood unchanged at a record
4.3 percent in September as the recession-hit country's work force
shrank for an eighth straight month, the government said Tuesday.
	   The ranks of the unemployed totaled 2.95 million people, with
the number of jobs falling by 700,000 to 65.26 million, the
Management and Coordination Agency said.
	   Japan's jobless rate first touched 4.3 percent in June, then
improved to 4.1 percent in July, temporarily bucking a trend that
has seen the rate rise steadily in recent months.
	   In a sign of continued corporate restructuring, the number of
employees at companies with 500 or more workers in September fell
by 20,000 jobs, or 0.2 percent, compared to a year ago _ the first
drop in 13 months.
	   Even as full-time worker payrolls have been cut at many
companies, the number of temporary employees increased by 200,000
to 4.91 million. That marked the 25th consecutive month of
increase.
	   Also Tuesday, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of job offers to
job seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, sank to 0.49 _ the
lowest level since the government began compiling such figures in
1963.
	   The figure means that only 49 jobs were available for every 100
people seeking employment.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Fuji Bank Ltd. will cut 1,200 jobs over the
next three years and close offices in Japan and overseas as part of
a broad restructuring plan, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The bank, one of Japan's largest, will cut the number of
overseas branches by half, and close about 50 branches at home, the
mass-circulation Yomiuri said. Fuji currently has 355 branches and
14,600 employees. The job cuts will be made by March 2001.
	   A spokesman for the bank refused to comment on the report.
	   The reduction is an increase from an earlier plan to trim 850
jobs and represents an acceleration of a three-year restructuring
plan announced by the bank in March, the newspaper said.
	   The bank plans to increase its capital by 200 billion yen (dlrs
1.7 billion) through contributions from companies within its
corporate group. Fuji is part of the Fuyo group, which also
includes companies such as Yasuda Trust and Banking Co.
	   Fuji also plans to ask for a capital infusion from the
government as part of Japan's plan to recapitalize its banking
system, the paper, Japan's largest, said.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Sri Lankan government is looking
for an opening to resume peace talks with Tamil separatists who
also appear to be searching for a break, political analysts and
government ministers said Tuesday.
	   The issue of resuming talks to end the 15-year-old Tamil
insurrection that has left an estimated 55,000 dead, 1 million
displaced and the economy in a shambles is politically so sensitive
that government ministers declined to speak on the record. But they
admit privately that the administration is indeed looking for an
opening.
	   Before the government commits itself to talks with the main
rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, it will have to
obtain total backing of the main opposition United National Party.
Without opposition support, the administration will be unable to
offer concessions to the rebels. The governing People's Alliance
Party has only a one-seat majority in the 225-member Parliament.
	   Next month's visit by British envoy Derek Fatchett could be
crucial. Fatchett is a successor to Liam Fox, who helped the UNP
and the government reach an agreement in 1997 that later faltered.
	   Fatchett is coming to inaugurate a British trade fair, but local
reports say his schedule includes meeting with President Chandrika
Kumaratunga and UNP leader Ranil Wickramasinghe.

Mobs lynch three suspected killers in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An angry mob killed three people after
accusing them of involvement in a wave of bizarre killings and set
fire to the car they were traveling in, police said Tuesday.
	   Police fired shots and tear gas Monday in an unsuccessful
attempt to ward off the crowd in the eastern part of Java,
Indonesia's main island.
	   The region has been shaken by the murders of more than 150
people in the patematic killings.
	   The victims on Monday were driving from the capital of Jakarta
to their hometown of Sampang on Madura, an island off eastern Java.
Armed vigilantes stopped them in Brondong district, said Lt. Col.
Agus Pratikto, the local police chief.
	   The mob beat them to death and torched their car after finding
three Maduranese traditional daggers and black clothing inside. The
mysterious killers are said to wear black ninja-like clothing.
	   Pratikto said there was no evidence that the victims were
involved in the killings, and the black clothes were only jeans.
Also, many Maduranese people carry daggers.
	   He said the victims had probably broken through one vigilante
checkpoint because they felt threatened. More than 20 police were
unable to save them and there were no arrests.
	   ``We fired warning shots and tear gas but it wasn't enough to
stop the large numbers of people,'' Pratikto said.
	   In eastern Java, about 330 people have been arrested, and 22
people convicted in mob attacks have been sentenced to five years
in prison.

	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ A car bomb exploded in this southern
Lebanese port Tuesday, seriously injuring a leader of the Islamic
Jihad militant group and three other persons, security officials
said.
	   Mahmoud Majzoub, his wife Mona, their 4-year-old son and an
unidentified man were rushed to hospital where their condition was
later described as ``stable.''
	   The blast took place as Majzoub, 31, tried to start his car at 9
a.m. local time (0700 GMT) on a main road in east Sidon, 45
kilometers (27 miles) south of Beirut, the officials said, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The fourth victim is believed to be a Syrian passer-by, the
officials said.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing.
	   Islamic Jihad is a hard-line Palestine group with a number of
followers in the Palestinian refugee camps outside Sidon. In 1995
its leader, Fathi Shekaki, was gunned down outside a hotel in Malta
in an assassination widely blamed on Israeli agents.
	   A spokesman for Jihad's headquarters in Damascus told The
Associated Press that the movement would issue a statement about
the bombing later Tuesday.
	   The bombing occurred as security forces in Sidon were on the
lookout for three people wanted in connection with the drive-by
killing of two policemen conducting traffic in the city's main
square on Saturday night.
	   The shooting was the latest in a spate of attacks during the
past three months in which the victims were often liquor store
owners. Security officials believe Muslim fundamentalist groups,
seeking a ban on alcohol, could be behind the shootings.

Serb forces redeploy in Kosovo as NATO deadline nears

 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic, facing
a NATO deadline Tuesday, has made a significant last-minute
pullback of his military and police forces in Kosovo to avert NATO
airstrikes.
	   International observers were out in force on Tuesday in the
majority Albanian province to see whether the pullback is genuine.
U.S. officials in Washington say the Clinton administration wants
to make sure of that before declaring that Milosevic had satisfied
the terms of the deal he accepted to end the crisis.
	   ``We want to make sure the movements are a real withdrawal and
not a reconfiguration (of forces),'' said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
	   ``They're going down to the wire,'' said Shaun Byrnes, head of
the American section of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission,
which has been monitoring the situation since July. ``It's been the
pattern.''
	   Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 have been driven from
their homes in seven months of fighting since Milosevic launched a
crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and
most want independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The 16-nation NATO alliance has threatened to launch airstrikes
unless Milosevic halts his crackdown and cuts his forces to levels
in place before the conflict began in February.
	   Convoys of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks carrying
Yugoslav troops and police left several areas ahead of the 1900
GMTdeadline for compliance in this southern province.
	   According to observers, the forces were headed to their barracks
or back to Serbia.
	   ``They need to pull more people out of Kosovo to satisfy the
agreement,'' Byrnes said at the end of a strenuous day of
patrolling and observing Monday. He said observers will be out in
force Tuesday to see whether Milosevic is complying.
	   The observer mission is the spearhead of what will become up to
2,000 ``ground verifiers'' under the command of the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Kosovo's Serb governor, Veljko Odalovic, thanked the police for
``bringing peace to Kosovo'' and pledged the province will be
defended from ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' with or without the
police.
	   In Kosovo's central Drenica region on Monday, tanks withdrew
from roadside positions where they had dug in since Oct. 18.
Several police checkpoints were vacant, including one in Malisevo _
scene of the latest fighting. All that remained was a tattered
Serbian flag hung over a pile of bricks.
	   At another checkpoint, in Dragobilje, which was occupied by
heavily armed Serb police a few days earlier, a uniformed ethnic
Albanian guerrilla stood holding an automatic rifle.
	   The real test of the pullback will be if refugees begin
returning to their homes. Most say they won't go home until Serb
police leave their villages. So far, returns have been a trickle.
	   A NATO source in Brussels, Belgium, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the alliance's ambassadors probably would wait
until shortly before the deadline to declare whether Milosevic met
the conditions.
	   He said NATO was still prepared to use military force if
necessary. The deadline has already been extended once since
Milosevic agreed to the peace plan.
	   NATO and the U.N. Security Council have also demanded that
Milosevic allow international organizations to deliver humanitarian
aid to the Kosovo refugees without interference.

Car bomb explosion wounds four people in south Lebanon

	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ A car bomb exploded in this southern
Lebanese port Tuesday, seriously injuring a leader of the Islamic
Jihad militant group and three others, security officials said.
	   Mahmoud Majzoub, his wife Mona, their 4-year-old son and an
unidentified man were rushed to hospital where their condition was
later described as ``stable.''
	   The blast took place as Majzoub, 31, tried to start his car at 9
a.m. local time (0700 GMT) on a main road in east Sidon, 45
kilometers (27 miles) south of Beirut, the officials said, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The fourth victim is believed to be a Syrian passer-by, the
officials said.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing.
	   Islamic Jihad is a hard-line Palestine group with some followers
in the Palestinian refugee camps outside Sidon. In 1995 its leader,
Fathi Shekaki, was gunned down outside a hotel in Malta in an
assassination widely blamed on Israeli agents.
	   A spokesman for Jihad's headquarters in Damascus told The
Associated Press that the movement would issue a statement about
the bombing later Tuesday.
	   The bombing occurred as security forces in Sidon were on the
lookout for three people wanted in connection with the drive-by
killing of two policemen directing traffic in the city's main
square on Saturday night.
	   The shooting was the latest in a spate of attacks during the
past three months in which the victims were often liquor store
owners. Security officials believe Muslim fundamentalist groups,
seeking a ban on alcohol, could be behind the shootings.

Uganda seeks leaders' views on proposed amnesty law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Government officials on Monday began
seeking local leaders' views on a proposed law that would grant
amnesty to Ugandan rebels who lay down their arms.
	   A team headed by State Minister for Local Government Kahinda
Otafiire went to western districts of Bundibugyo, Kasese and Fort
Portal where rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces are active.
	   The rebels have bases on the slopes of the Rwenzori mountains,
which straddle Uganda's border with Congo.
	   President Yoweri Museveni's government has admitted Ugandan
troops are inside eastern Congo to fight Ugandan rebels and destroy
their bases.
	   The government recently appointed five Cabinet ministers to head
teams to solicit views from local leaders in rebel-infested regions
for incorporation into new legislation.
	   The government also is fighting rebels in northern and
northwestern Uganda, where teams also were expected to seek
opinions.
	   A presidential pardon already is available to rebels who
surrender, but Parliament wants comprehensive legislation.
	   Meanwhile, the government-controlled newspaper, New Vision,
reported that a 5-year-old and two soldiers were killed Friday when
Lord's Resistance Army rebels ambushed a passenger truck.
	   The privately owned Central Broadcasting Service radio said the
truck was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade near Pawell village,
about 400 kilometers (250 miles) northwest of Kampala.

Hong Kong share prices rebound
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
rebounded Tuesday in moderate trading.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 148.14 points, or 1.5
percent, to 9,927.05, its highest close since May 12. On Monday,
the index had lost 38.84 points.
	   Turnover rose to 6.03 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 773
million) from Monday's 5.25 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
673 million).
	   Brokers attributed the rise largely to futures-related buying as
investors attempted to push the futures index higher ahead of the
expiration of the October contract Thursday.
	   They said expectations of further interest rate cuts in the
United States and Hong Kong also boosted local shares.
	   The Hong Kong market will be closed Wednesday for a public
holiday.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 2.20 Hong Kong
dollars to 48.30, and Cheung Kong rose 75 cents to 51.50.
	   In the banking sector, Hang Seng Bank rose 1.25 dollars to
67.00, and HSBC Holdings rose 1.00 dollar to 179.50.
	   Elsewhere, Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 2.00 dollars to 34.60, and
Hutchison Whampoa rose 75 cents to 52.50.

Troubled Congolese peace talks go into second day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MILDRED MULENGA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Talks to end fighting in Congo resumed
Tuesday for an unscheduled second day after late night sessions
that failed to produce a cease-fire.
	   Defense, foreign ministers and officials from 12 African nations
broke into two working groups Tuesday, officials said.
	   The 14-nation Southern African Development Community and
continent-wide Organization of African Unity are sponsoring the
talks.
	   A full session was planned after officials of Zambia and the two
organizations confer with rebel representatives.
	   The rebels, led by former Congolese foreign minister Bizima
Karaha, have been excluded from the talks but to ease mediation
efforts they were moved late Monday to rooms in the hotel where the
ministers are gathered.
	   ``It's a very complicated situation,'' SADC secretary-general
Kaire Mbuende told reporters. ``It's too early to tell, but we are
still hopeful'' of success.
	   Monday's negotiations in Zambia's capital were held in secret,
and few details were made available.
	   Mbuende said ministers were seeking an immediate cessation of
hostilities and discussed ``technical details that will be required
for full implementation of a cease fire.''
	   Embattled Congolese President Laurent Kabila has repeatedly
refused to meet with rebels fighting to oust him.
	   On Monday, rebel spokesman Wamba dia Wamba said the rebels were
demanding direct talks with the Congolese government before
agreeing to a cease-fire.
	   The rebel forces, composed of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted
members of Kabila's army and opposition politicians, accuse Kabila
of corruption, mismanagement and stirring up ethnic rivalries.
	   Previous talks aimed at ending the fighting have been
unsuccessful, mostly because the rebels have been excluded.
	   Kabila's government insists the rebels are puppets of Rwanda and
Uganda.
	   Rwanda has denied it has troops in Congo. Uganda acknowledges it
has soldiers in the country, but says they are there only to strike
at Ugandan rebels based across the border.
	   The southern African nations of Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia
have sent troops and equipment to back Kabila and fended off a
rebel advance on the capital, Kinshasa, in August.
	   Last week, Kabila's military allies announced they will mount an
offensive against rebel strongholds in the rugged jungle terrain of
eastern Congo.
	   Officials from South Africa, Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania and
Gabon are also among delegates at the Lusaka meeting.
	   South Africa has launched its own peace initiative by holding
separate talks with Rwandan, Ugandan and rebel leaders.

De Klerk aims to halt Truth Commission report on Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Lawyers for former President F.
W. de Klerk will on Wednesday ask a court to prevent a panel
probing apartheid abuses from implicating him in apartheid crimes,
a spokesman said.
	   The filing had been scheduled for Tuesday, but lawyers for the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which plans to release its
final report on Thursday, were not yet ready.
	   ``As I understand it the TRC lawyers need more time to read the
legal papers,'' said de Klerk's advisor, David Steward.
	   De Klerk wants the High Court in Cape Town to stop the Truth
Commission from concluding that he was ``an accessory after the
fact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church
group and of a labor federation.
	   Lawyers for de Klerk will ask the court for a publication ban,
just one day before the commission is to give President Nelson
Mandela its findings on abuses committed by all sides during the
struggle against white rule.
	   In its report, the commission is expected to say that although
de Klerk did not order the bombings, he subsequently came to know
about the roles of former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and
Johan van der Merwe, a former police commissioner, but failed to
report the information to police.
	   The finding could pave the way for the de Klerk's prosecution
because he did not seek amnesty in connection with the bombings of
the buildings that housed anti-apartheid groups.
	   De Klerk's lawyers are expected to contend that when he learned
about the bombings, Vlok and Van der Merwe were already in the
process of applying for amnesty, and he did not think it was
necessary to report the matter to the police.
	   The Truth Commission can grant amnesty to those who fully
confess to politically motivated crimes committed during apartheid.

Report: Japanese tourists targeted in passport thefts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Thieves posing as hotel employees have been
stealing the passports of Japanese tourists in Singapore, which
prides itself on safe streets and low crime, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   More than a dozen Japanese have recently reported stolen
passports to their embassy or the police, The Straits Times said.
	   Two men posing as hotel employees have called unsuspecting
guests and asked to photocopy their passports for the hotel.
Dressed like hotel staff or wearing hotel name tags, they collected
the travel documents, then disappeared.
	   Japanese Consul T. Ishikawa told the paper that he suspects a
syndicate peddling the stolen passports, which the newspaper said
cost more than 1,500 Singapore dollars (dlrs 920) on the black
market.
	   The thieves probably obtained the names of the Japanese guests
from people working in the tourism industry, said a hotel security
manager.
	   A Japanese tourist was killed in her five-star hotel room in a
robbery in 1994, arousing public criticism of many hotels' security
standards here.

Petition drive underway to lease Kurils to Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A petition is being circulated in the Kuril
Islands to lease the disputed islands to Japan on a long-term
basis, the Interfax news agency said Tuesday.
	   The Soviet Union occupied the islands at the end of World War
II, and they are claimed by both Russia and Japan. The issue has
prevented the two countries from signing a peace treaty.
	   The petition was driven by ``the complete indifference of the
federal (Russian) government to the problems of a remote province,
and the reluctance of domestic investors to invest in the
advancement of the South Kurils,'' said Vladimir Zema, head of the
South Kuril local administration.
	   Zema said local authorities in the Kuril Islands have the right
under a 1992 presidential decree to lease land to foreigners for up
to 99 years.

South Korean golfer Pak returns home a heroine

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ When she left for the United States a
year ago, Se Ri Pak was just a promising young golfer, little known
even in her homeland.
	   On Tuesday, Pak returned home as a national heroine, probably
the biggest sports sensation South Korea has ever had. Awaiting her
were a government medal and a dinner with the prime minister.
	   ``I am satisfied with my debut year. I really thank fans at home
for their enthusiastic support,'' Pak said with a broad smile
during a brief news conference at the airport.
	   Pak's meteoric rise in the LPGA was the best news South Korea
has had in a year of deep economic trouble. She also stirred
unprecedented public interest in the sport in a country where most
people wouldn't know a birdie from a bogey.
	   The 20-year-old South Korean won the LPGA Championship in May.
She won the U.S. Women's Open a month later, broke the LPGA scoring
record with a 61 in winning the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic and then
rallied to beat Dottie Pepper down the stretch at the Giant Eagle
LPGA Classic two weeks later.
	   Hers was the best rookie season since Nancy Lopez won nine
events in 1978.
	   President Kim Dae-jung planned to award Pak the Order of Sport
Merit Maengho (Brave Tiger) Medal next Monday. It is the second
highest honor the government can confer to an athlete.
	   Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil, an avid golf fan, was to give a
dinner for Pak later Tuesday.
	   Pak's feat even surprised her corporate sponsor, Samsung, which
first saw her extraordinary potential and paid for her to move to
Florida and train under David Leadbetter.
	   ``We had hoped she would win one tournament by the end of the
season. Four victories! It's quite a surprise. We will spare no
efforts to assist her in the future,'' said Samsung executive Won
Dae-yon.
	   Pak will play in a non-tour event in her honor this week before
heading to Japan for the Japan Classic, the next-to-last official
LPGA event, where she will try to cut into her 40-point deficit
with Anika Sorenstam for LPGA Player of the Year.
	   Pak has not won a tournament since July.
	   To South Korean fans and TV stations yearning for weeks for a
new victory, Pak said she was not hurrying.
	   ``I had a tough march this year since this is my debut year. It
somewhat strained my stamina,'' Pak said when asked whether she
played too many tournaments this season.
	   ``Next year, I will have a more relaxing season schedule and
have a better record. I will need more time to become an even
better player,'' she said.
	   Pak has played 27 LPGA tournaments so far this year and plans to
attend two more _ the Japanese Classic and the LPGA Tour
Championship. That's four more than the average 25 tournaments a
year for most top LPGA players.
	   She said she needs a rest badly.
	   ``While I am here, I want to take a rest no matter what. Going
shopping and gossiping with friends, that's what I want the most,''
Pak said.
	   But free time was a luxury Pak could hardly afford. Her weeklong
schedule in South Korea was packed with interviews, TV appearances,
meet-the-fans events staged by Samsung, and welcome-home ceremonies
in two provincial cities where she grew up.
	   Pak was even scheduled to make a four-hour appearance as a guest
of honor for the ``Se Ri Cup'' junior golf tournament Wednesday.

Malaysian dissident calls on prime minister to resign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with Anwar calling on Mahathir to resign,
statement from Amnesty International &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian dissident Anwar Ibrahim
said from jail Tuesday that his former mentor, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, should resign in an effort to maintain peace in
the Southeast Asian nation.
	   Anwar, jailed on charges of corruption and sodomy, said in a
statement read by his wife that violent demonstrations over the
weekend were proof that Mahathir was losing his grip.
	   ``Do not use violence for the sheer purpose of protecting one's
power and one's family wealth,'' Anwar said.
	   In weekly Saturday gatherings, thousands have taken to the
streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur to demand justice for Anwar and an
end to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   A full-scale riot broke out for the first time in nearly three
decades Saturday night, with riot police firing tear gas and water
cannons at protesters inside a mosque.
	   Some 270 people were arrested.
	   Anwar supporters maintain that police started the violence by
firing tear gas at the mosque; police say protesters first lobbed
rocks and bricks at them.
	   Some of those dragged into the streets by police were shoppers
who got stuck in the middle of the melee.
	   ``Ponder the fate of thousands of ordinary people who have
suffered as a result of brutality on the part of the police
force,'' Anwar said.
	   ``All channels of expression and the right of assembly have been
denied to the people,'' Anwar added. ``Dr. Mahathir must accept the
fact, hear the grievances of his own people, and withdraw from the
scene in an honorable manner. Protect the peace and harmony of this
beloved country of ours, Malaysia.''
	   Anwar urged his followers to hold their rallies in peace and
called on police to ``avoid the use of force against members of
your own family.''
	   Mahathir denied Tuesday that police had provoked the violence.
He blamed protesters for triggering the chaos to force his ouster,
citing May riots in Indonesia that ended the 32-year reign of
President Suharto.
	   ``Obviously the demonstration is a duplication of the
demonstration in Indonesia,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying by the
national news agency Bernama.
	   ``If the government is toppled, there will be no trial for
(Anwar) and then of course he will get away scot-free,'' Mahathir
said.
	   Anwar goes on trial Nov. 2, facing 10 counts of graft and
sodomy, charges he denies and calls politically motivated.
	   Police have banned anti-government rallies but the crowds have
turned out defiantly, drawing a wider cross-section of Malaysians,
including businessmen, civil servants, students and housewives with
children.
	   Police are now warning parents their children could be taken
from them under child welfare laws if they bring them to the
anti-government rallies.
	   On Monday, Mahathir accused rioters of using women and children
as ``shields'' to protect against police.
	   Yaacub Amin, head of the police department's Criminal
Investigation Department, said the tactic, if true, was illegal.
Citing the Child Protection Act, he said police at upcoming rallies
would not hesitate to seize children temporarily to ``protect''
them from their own parents.
	   ``There has been one too many cases where parents had brought
their children for illegal gatherings,'' Yaacub was quoted as
saying in the newspaper New Straits Times. ``This cannot go on, and
we have to put a stop to it right now.''
	   Anti-government demonstrations were mostly unheard of in docile
Malaysia until Mahathir fired Anwar as deputy prime minister and
finance minister on Sept. 2, calling him morally unfit to lead the
country.
	   Amnesty International said in a statement it was concerned the
police crackdown on demonstrations would further inflame violence
in the Malaysian capital.
	   ``Unless discontent is allowed free expression, there is a risk
that public anger will turn to violence,'' the London-based human
rights group said.

German high court overturns Bavarian law limiting abortions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest court Tuesday tossed
out a Bavarian law that sought to severely restrict access to
abortion in the state by limiting how much a doctor could earn from
the procedure.
	   The Constitutional Court voted 5-3 to declare the 1996 state law
unconstitutional. The law was to go into effect last year but had
been blocked by the high court pending its ruling.
	   The law stated that doctors in Bavaria may not derive more than
25 percent of their income from performing abortions. It also
required women to justify why they are seeking an abortion.
	   Officials of Bavaria's conservative ruling party, the Christian
Social Union, argued abortion clinics violated the concept of
protecting unborn life. They also said doctors who are financially
dependent on performing abortions would be less likely to advise a
pregnant woman about other options.
	   But doctors challenging the law charged it would only end up
inconveniencing women seeking abortions by making them travel
farther, possibly creating health risks.
	   Two doctors who together perform about 6,000 abortions a year _
two thirds of all abortions done in Bavaria _ also argued the law
would mean financial ruin for them.
	   Among other grounds, the Constitutional Court agreed with the
doctors that the law breached their freedom to exercise a
profession of their choice.

	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Two-time major winner John Daly
will make up half of the United States team at next month's World
Cup of Golf at Whangaparaoa, an official said Tuesday.
	   New Zealand Professional Golfers Association president Richard
Ellis said the 1991 USPGA and 1995 British Open champion had
confirmed his presence for the Nov. 19-22 two-man teams tournament.
Daly will play with Scott Verplank, who is ranked No. 17 on the
U.S. tour.
	   Daly was undefeated at the recent Dunhill Cup at St. Andrews but
has been in miserable form on the PGA tour this year. He has
finished no higher than 53rd since the Masters back in April.
	   ``I think it is fantastic that John Daly is coming, he's such a
cult figure,'' Ellis said Tuesday.

La Nina's effects have begun in the Philippines, weather bureau
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Two intense typhoons that struck the
Philippines in the past two weeks are an indication that the ``La
Nina'' weather phenomenon has begun affecting the country, the
weather bureau said Tuesday.
	   ``It is here,'' said Ernesto Verceles, a weather specialist at
the Philippines Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services
Administration.
	   ``We should be ready for the worst,'' he said. ``The two
previous storms were indications of things to come.''
	   Meanwhile, the death toll rose to 189 for Typhoon Babs, which
hit the Philippines last week. At least 74 died a week earlier in
Typhoon Zeb.
	   Last year, the Philippines suffered from a long drought
attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon, a result of higher
temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. La Nina, attributed to an
abnormal cooling of the sea surface, is expected to cause heavy
rains for the rest of this year.
	   The weather bureau expects that La Nina will intensify the
effects of at least five more tropical storms expected to strike
the country in coming months. Provinces on the east side of Luzon,
the Philippines' main island, will feel the brunt of the storms,
Verceles said.
	   ``Storms from the Pacific will hit the area with force before
they weaken after hitting the mountain ranges on their way west
toward the South China Sea,'' he said.
	   The weather bureau is preparing an advisory on La Nina's effects
that will be issued to prepare residents living near rivers and
along the coast, he said.
	   About 152 of the deaths last week from Typhoon Babs were
recorded in the Bicol region on the eastern coast, where the storm
came ashore.
	   Emilia Tadeo, an official at the Office of Civil Defense, said
rescue workers are still finding bodies under landslides in
Catanduanes Island in Bicol.
	   At least 53 people are still missing from the storm, she said.

Boxer dies after losing by knockout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Super bantamweight Japanese boxer Ken Katagiri died
Tuesday of brain damage, two weeks after suffering a knockout
defeat, the Japan Boxing Commissioner said.
	   Katagiri, 28, was the 28th boxer to die from injuries suffered
in a bout since the commission was set up in 1952, said Tsuyoshi
Yasukouchi, a spokesman for the commissioner.
	   It was the first ring fatality since junior bantamweight Akira
Taiga died after suffering a knockout defeat in October 1997,
Yasukouchi said.
	   Despite the deaths, there have been no significant calls in
Japan to ban boxing.
	   Katagiri was knocked down by Japan's No. 9 super bantamweight
contender, Fusaaki Takenaga, in the ninth round of a scheduled
10-round bout at Tokyo's Korakuen boxing hall on Oct. 12.
	   He stood up and tried to fight, but the 24-year-old Takenaga
punished him with a series of blows to the face. Katagiri went down
again and fell into a coma.
	   He was taken to a hospital in downtown Tokyo and underwent brain
surgery.
	   Katagiri became a pro boxer in January 1991 and had a record of
five victories, six defeats and two draws.

Anti-government protesters demonstrate in Grozny
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ More than 2,000 people demanding the
ouster of Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov rallied in the regional
capital on Tuesday, the seventh anniversary of the breakaway
republic's first presidential election.
	   Two former rebel leaders and Maskhadov opponents, Shamil Basayev
and Salman Raduyev, were scheduled to speak to the crowd, many of
whom waved banners reading ``People are hungry'' and ``Maskhadov go
home.''
	   About 500 armed guards, supporters of Raduyev and Basayev,
attended the protest, which followed separate car bomb attacks in
the last two days that killed Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping
official and slightly injured a Muslim cleric.
	   Basayev and Raduyev have frequently accused Maskhadov of
violating Chechnya's constitution, and demand that he be impeached
for failing to bring peace to the republic, which has seen an
increase in violence and kidnappings for ransom since the end of
the 1994-96 war with Russia.
	   Government officials went on state television Monday night to
discourage people from attending the protest.
	   Local residents should ``understand the intentions of opposition
commanders and refrain from coming to the central square,'' said
Presidential Chief of Staff Apti Batalov, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Many field commanders from the war have remained outside the
control of the territory's government, which has unsuccessfully
tried to get them to disband.
	   ``There is no need to celebrate this date on days when the
republic claimed a mourning for the chief of the anti-kidnapping
agency,'' Batalov said.
	   Meanwhile, two policemen were wounded Tuesday on Chechnya's
border with Dagestan when unidentified attackers opened fire on
them from inside Chechnya, ITAR-Tass reported. They were not
seriously hurt, it said.
	   Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev seized power in the
republic in the aftermath of the failed 1991 coup against Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev. On Oct. 27, 1991, he was elected as the
region's first president and declared independence from Russia,
which was still part of the Soviet Union.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
war with Russia, but no country has recognized its independence
claim. Moscow insists the territory remains part of Russia.

Electronics makers Toshiba, Hitachi announce losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese electronics giant Toshiba Corp. posted
losses of more than dlrs 50 billion in the first half of fiscal
1998 _ the company's first dip into the red in nearly 50 years, the
company said Tuesday.
	   Hitachi Ltd., the country's largest electronics maker, also
announced losses for the half-year ended Sept. 30.
	   Toshiba posted a 6.4 billion yen (dlrs 53.6 million) parent
pretax loss for the latest six months, against a 25.4 billion yen
(dlrs 212 million) profit in the same period last year.
	   Toshiba also had a 6.4 billion yen (dlrs 53.6 million) parent
net loss for the half-year after posting a 22.45 billion yen (dlrs
188 million) profit the previous year.
	   Toshiba's parent sales were down 12.3 percent to 1.60 trillion
yen (dlrs 13.4 billion).
	   The company blamed its poor results on a drop in semiconductor
prices and slow demand for computers and consumer electronics. It
said the Asian financial crisis had cut into demand for memory
chips.
	   It was the first time the company had recorded pretax losses
since 1950, said company spokesman Kazuyoshi Ishiyama.
	   Hitachi recorded a parent pretax loss of 69.2 billion yen (dlrs
580 million) for the half-year compared to profits of 33.3 billion
yen (dlrs 279 billion) a year earlier.
	   The company recorded a parent net loss of 124.7 billion yen
(dlrs 1.04 billion) for the latest six months against a profit of
24.3 billion yen (dlrs 204 million) a year earlier.
	   Hitachi's parent sales were down 12 percent to 1.80 trillion yen
(dlrs 15.1 billion) from 2.05 trillion yen (dlrs 17.2 billion) the
previous year.
	   The company said the losses resulted from Japan's recession and
slumping semiconductor and consumer electronics sales.

Ex-Spanish coach Clemente takes over at struggling Betis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP)_ Javier Clemente, who was sacked last month
as Spanish national team coach, has been named new boss at Betis, a
side stuck at the bottom of the first division despite boasting one
of the world's most expensive players.
	   Clemente was named new coach late Monday following the weekend
sacking of Chilean Vicente Cantatore who was dismissed after the
side's 5-1 thrashing by Valencia.
	   Cantatore, in turn, had been named coach just three days before
the start of the season in August, replacing Portugal's Antonio
Oliveira who left after only two weeks on the job.
	   Betis, who signed Brazilian world cup ace Denilson this season
for a dlrs 35 million dollars, lies bottom of the 20-team division
with just one win and two draws in seven games. The Seville-based
side finished No. 8 last season to qualify for the UEFA cup, in
which it is still competing.
	   Clemente coached the Spanish national team between 1992-98 but
was fired last month when a humiliating defeat against
semiprofessional Cyprus in European qualifiers came too hot on the
heels of Spain's woeful performance in the World Cup in France this
summer.
	   His contract is to last until the end of the current season at
least, news reports said.

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT ARBA, West Bank (AP) _ Rabbis leading a tearful funeral
procession for a Jewish settler killed by suspected Palestinian
militants demanded Tuesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
go back on his promise to withdraw from West Bank land.
	   ``Mister prime minister, fix what you have ruined. There is
still time for repentance,'' said Rabbi Eliezer Waldman, a
spiritual leader of the Kiryat Arba settlement, where the victim,
29-year-old Danny Vargas, lived.
	   Some 1,500 mourners, many with tears streaming down their
cheeks, walked quietly behind the hearse passing through the
settlement just outside the West Bank town of Hebron. ng Monday in
the nearby West Bank town of Hebron put the new Israeli-Palestinian
peace agreement to a first test. A centerpiece of the agreement is
a pledge by the Palestinians to work harder to prevent attacks on
Israel and rein in militants.
	   In a sign of change, Palestinian security forces cooperated with
their Israeli counterparts in trying to catch Vargas' killers who
fled into the Palestinian-run sector of divided Hebron.
	   However, Israeli troops also imposed a curfew on the area in
downtown Hebron they control, barring some 30,000 Palestinians
there from leaving their homes. The army also sealed the city, and
Palestinians were not allowed to enter or leave.
	   The restrictions embittered many Palestinians who had hoped that
life would improve as a result of the peace agreement.
	   ``We thought that we could now go to Gaza, but we cannot even
leave our homes,'' said Hebron resident Khalil Jaberi, 26,
referring to a provision in the accord for a new land route for
Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip. embittered many
P In the northern West Bank, meanwhile, hundreds of Palestinians
clashed with Israeli troops on the outskirts of the Balata and
Askar refugee camps to protest Monday's killing of a 65-year-old
Palestinian whose body was found outside a Jewish settlement. s
fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse Palestinian stone
throwers, and two Palestinians were injured.
	   Monday's victim, Mohammed Zalmout, was bludgeoned to death, and
Israeli police received an anonymous call saying his body could be
found near the gate of the Itamar settlement. Israeli police
reportedly were searching for a suspect, a young Israeli man.
	   In several West Bank towns, meanwhile, the Fatah group of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat enforced a general strike to press
demands for the trial and execution of Palestinian military
intelligence agents responsible for the death of a Fatah activist.
	   In the town of Nablus, Fatah supporters fired in the air and
burned tires in a show of force.
	   The dispute The dispute began Sunday when military intelligence
raided Fatah offices in the West Bank town of Ramallah, seizing
files and weapons. When Fatah activists threw stones in protest,
military intelligence opened fire, killing 16-year-old Wissam
Tarifi.
	   Fatah leaders want Tarifi's killers to be tried and executed.
They also seek the ouster of the head of military intelligence,
Moussa Arafat, a distant relative of the Palestinian leader.
	   Arafat is abroad and will only return on Wednesday. He needs
Fatah's support to shape public opinion and he may have to act
quickly to quell the growing rebellion of his loyalists.
	   In a similar case in August, Fatah demanded that Arafat order
the execution of two Palestinian policemen convicted of killing two
Fatah activists in a personal dispute. Arafat complied and ordered
the defendants be sent before a firing squad in the first execution
in the autonomous areas.

Philippine lawyers file final appeal to save rapist from execution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Lawyers for the first man sentenced
to die in the Philippines in two decades filed a final petition at
the Supreme Court Tuesday in an attempt to prevent his execution.
	   Prison authorities said they are ready any time to execute Leo
Echegaray, a poor house painter convicted of repeatedly raping his
10-year-old stepdaughter.
	   Echegaray is the first of more than 700 death-row inmates
scheduled to die under a law that restored capital punishment in
1994. His impending execution by lethal injection has triggered a
debate on the death penalty that has divided many Filipinos.
	   Lawyer Theodore Te, who represents Echegaray, said he will argue
at the Supreme Court that the government failed to execute him
within the time frame prescribed by law.
	   Under the 1994 law, an execution should be carried out not
earlier than one year or later than 18 months after a death
sentence has been declared final by the Supreme Court.
	   The Supreme Court, which automatically reviews all death
sentences, declared Echegaray's death sentence final on Feb. 27,
1997, thereby setting the date of his execution between Feb. 27 and
Aug. 27 this year.
	   However, the execution was delayed because of several petitions
filed by Echegaray's lawyers at the Supreme Court.
	   Last week, the Supreme Court rejected a last petition
questioning the constitutionality of lethal injections.
	   Government lawyer Ricardo Galvez said the court should reject
Echegaray's final appeal because if it succeeds ``it will be easy
for every death convict to circumvent the death penalty by simply
delaying their execution.''
	   Te said the law clearly states the execution period and the
Philippine Congress, not the court, could alter that time frame
through an amendment. Aware of this, the Supreme Court should have
resolved all of Echegaray's petitions before the execution period
lapsed, he said.
	   Prison superintendent Venancio Tesoro said a 39-member execution
team, which he heads, is now ready to execute Echegaray. He said
they have tightened security around Echegaray's death row cell by
increasing checks and patrols.
	   Tesoro said Echegaray ``remains stable and normal and has turned
to prayer, hoping for a miracle.''
	   The 1987 constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option to restore it for crimes such as murder,
kidnappings for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Recently, Philippine Roman Catholic bishops appealed to
President Joseph Estrada to stop Echegaray's execution but
officials said Estrada will not change his decision not to pardon
the convict.
	   Church leaders and other civic groups oppose the death penalty,
arguing there is no concrete proof that it deters crime. Opponents
also say the poor are disadvantaged because they cannot afford good
lawyers for their defense.
	   Proponents say it is too early for the death penalty to serve as
a deterrent to crime because no one has been executed under the new
law.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's rugby team will play twice
at the yet to be completed 2000 Olympic Stadium next year in the
buildup to the World Cup.
	   The Melbourne Cricket Ground has lost a test despite attracting
90,000 and 75,000 to matches against New Zealand in the past two
years.
	   Sydney's 110,000 capacity Olympic Stadium has been chosen to
host the Cenetenary test against England on June 26 and the
Bledisloe Cup match against New Zealand on Aug. 28.
	   The opening tests of the season against Ireland have been given
to Brisbane's Ballymore (June 12) and Perth's Subiaco Oval (June
19), leaving Melbourne dry despite filling the Australian Rugby
Union's coffers with two of the biggest crowds in its history.
	   ``All I can say is that it's very, very disappointing,''
Victorian Rugby Union general manager Ron Steiner said Tuesday.
	   ARU managing director John O'Neill, in Dublin for an
International Rugby Board meeting, said in a statement the schedule
allowed rugby to continue its expansion nationally while allowing
strongholds Sydney and Brisbane to host the biggest names in world
rugby.

Air Force jet crashes in northern India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A Indian Air Force jet flying in
northern India lost control and plunged in a ball of flames into a
remote mountainous forest Tuesday, police and the air force said.
	   The fate of the pilot was not immediately known. Rescuers had
reached the area in Himachal Pradesh state, a police officer in
Shahpur, the town nearest to the village where the plane crashed,
told The Associated Press by telephone.
	   ``A village headman phoned us saying people had seen a plane
going down in the forest,'' officer Om Beer said. ``We are looking
for the pilot.''
	   Air Force spokesman Squadron Leader R.K. Dhingra said in New
Delhi the plane was a single-seater Mig-2.
	   The plane crashed deep inside in a dense forest a four-kilometer
(two- mile) walk from the nearest road, the officer said.
	   Few other details were available.

Record price set at auction for famous Australian wine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ A bottle of 1951 Penfolds Grange
Hermitage set a record for Australian wine when it sold for 20,460
Australian dollars (about U.S dlrs 12,600) at an auction Monday.
	   The price fetched for the rare wine topped the previous record
of 18,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 11,000) _ also for a 1951
Grange _ set earlier this year, said auctioneer Stewart Langton,
from Langton's Fine Wine Auctions.
	   ``That's the highest ever achieved for a bottle of Australian
wine,'' Langton said.
	   Langton would not reveal who bought the Grange at the Wine
Australia Shiraz auction in Melbourne, but said the bottle would
remain in Australia as part of a set of Grange.
	   Created by wine industry legend Max Schubert, the 1951 Grange
was the first vintage of what has become Australia's most famous
wine.
	   With fewer than 100 bottles left in the world, the 1951 is in
hot demand because it was never released. The first commercial
Grange was the 1952, which was released in 1955.

Yeltsin's weak health forces cancellation of Austrian trip

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin checked into a sanatorium Tuesday, a
day after doctors ordered him to cancel yet another foreign trip
because of high blood pressure and extreme fatigue.
	   Yeltsin's announcement Monday that he would not make the one-day
trip to Austria fueled speculation about his ability to stay in
office and guide Russia through its worst economic crisis in the
post-Soviet era.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov went to Vienna in Yeltsin's
place to meet with European Union leaders and international
lenders.
	   Yeltsin's office said Monday the 67-year-old Russian leader was
suffering from an ``asthenic condition.'' Asthenia refers to a lack
of physical strength.
	   Yeltsin's blood pressure was also unstable and doctors
recommended a vacation, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said.
	   On Tuesday, Yeltsin checked into the Barvikha sanatorium near
Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Yakushkin.
Yeltsin has stayed there in the past, including when he was
recovering from multiple heart bypass surgery in 1996.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin would undergo ``a course of restoration
treatment,'' Interfax reported. The length of his stay depends on
the treatment scheduled, he said, without elaborating.
	   ``This is perhaps the first time recently when the president has
listened to his doctors' advice,'' Yeltsin aid Oleg Sysuyev said
Monday on the Russian TV program ``Hero of the Day.''
	   ``The president is not ill enough to be considered incapable of
working,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin's recent ailments have heightened calls for his
resignation. If he were to step down _ though he insists he won't _
he would be replaced by Primakov, who would be required to call new
elections within three months.
	   Primakov has been prime minister for only six weeks and has yet
to produce his own blueprint to deal with the country's deep-rooted
economic problems. But he is widely respected by all political
factions and is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when
Yeltsin has receded into the background.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Tuesday that Yeltsin's
aides are ``mocking'' Russians by insisting he has no crippling
illness.
	   ``Mr. Yeltsin's inability to work has been obvious to us for
quite a long time,'' Zyuganov said at a news conference. He called
for Yeltsin to undergo an independent medical exam and for the
results to be made public.
	   Primakov held talks with Yeltsin at the president's Gorky-9
country residence outside of Moscow before leaving for Vienna,
Yeltsin's press service said.
	   Yeltsin authorized him to tell European Union officials about
the government's plan to cope with the latest economic crisis,
Yakushkin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   For several months now, Yeltsin has rarely put in full days at
the Kremlin, spending most of his time at his country residences.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems, But the
president and his doctors insist that he'll serve out the rest of
his term, set to end in the summer of 2000, and deny he has
crippling health problems.
	   Still, Yeltsin clearly lacks the energy he displayed in his
early years in office.
	   Potential candidates in the 2000 presidential race have already
begun an informal campaign to replace Yeltsin. Leading contenders
include Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov and Alexander Lebed, a former general and now governor of
a vast Siberian region.
	   Russian newspapers have speculated that Yeltsin is afflicted
with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, but their reports are
based simply on his public appearances, not on medical
examinations.
	   Yeltsin cannot point to any major accomplishments since he was
re-elected in 1996, yet many warn his resignation would trigger a
political crisis on top of Russia's economic turmoil.
	   Yeltsin was forced to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier
this month because of a respiratory infection. He has already
canceled a visit to Malaysia that was planned for next month, but a
visit to India in December was still on his schedule.

Cambodia displays mine clearance techniques to help others
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   KOMPONG CHHNANG, Cambodia (AP) _ Although thousands of
kilometers (miles) apart, Cambodia and Mozambique share a major
problem: decades of war have left millions of land mines buried in
their soil.
	   Mine clearance organizations from the two nations, as well as
other mine-infested countries around the world, were brought
together Tuesday for a rare opportunity to share field techniques
of the humanitarian trade.
	   On the second day of an international conference on land mine
issues, more than 100 participants abandoned Phnom Penh hotel
conference rooms and boarded buses for a tour of the Cambodian Mine
Action Center's training facility 90 kilometers (56 miles) north of
the Cambodian capital.
	   Jose Amibal de Almeida, director of Mozambique's Accelerated
Demining Program, watched intently at the training center as CMAC
officials showed off an array of mine detection and clearance
methods.
	   CMAC's display included traditional manual clearing methods,
dogs trained to sniff out mines and a mechanical ``mine flail''
that can clear swaths of land in a fraction of the time it takes by
hand.
	   ``What we are fighting for in Mozambique is to have the best
integrated system of mine clearance between dogs and mechanical and
manual methods,'' de Almeida said after the demonstrations.
	   Delegates from Nicaragua, Angola, Laos and Sri Lanka also
attended the presentation of what is considered one of the world's
most advanced mine clearing operations.
	   Between 4 million and 6 million mines are estimated to be buried
inside Cambodia's borders, deadly reminders of the decades of war
that tailed off with the signing of a 1991 peace treaty.
	   Mozambique's civil war left 2 million to 3 million mines
remaining in its soil.
	   CMAC director Sam Sotha hailed the conference in Cambodia as a
departure from others held in developed cities like Tokyo or Ottawa
that are mostly a forum for promoting international mine awareness
and donor support.
	   ``This conference is not for the purpose of pledges, it is to
share the knowledge with our colleagues from other infested
countries,'' he said at the training center.
	   Delegates from Mozambique said mine clearance standards in their
country were on par with CMAC's, but that Cambodia had a clear
advantage in infrastructure and equipment, perhaps because of the
greater international attention its conflict received.
	   ``This reinforces that we must have international support for
our operation. We cannot do it alone,'' said Armando Joao, a mine
clearer from Mozambique.
	   A spirited discussion at the opening of the conference Monday
focused on mine clearance cooperation among countries in the
southern hemisphere, de Almeida said.
	   That spirit appeared to have carried over into Tuesday's tour,
he said, as Africans and Central Americans discussed Cambodia's
presentation over lunch.
	   ``We really feel the need for `south-south' cooperation, to have
a real exchange of information between mine-infested countries,''
he said.

Subbing for ailing Yeltsin, Primakov arrives to brief EU on

economic recovery plan &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Substituting for an ailing Boris
Yeltsin, Russia's prime minister arrived Tuesday to brief the
European Union on economic recovery plans and seek help in coping
with Moscow's worst economic crisis of the post-Soviet era.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov made the one-day trip at the
head of a Russian delegation after doctors ordered the Russian
president to stay home. Yeltsin checked into a sanatorium Tuesday
for an unspecified ``course of restoration treatment,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Following official welcoming ceremonies with Austrian President
Thomas Klestil, Primakov was to meet Prime Minister Viktor Klima;
the head of the European Commission Jacques Santer and EU
Commissioner Hans van den Broek.
	   Primakov was accompanied to Vienna by Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and several other ministers in charge of economic and
financial policies.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency. Klima and
the others will be seeking not only assurances that Russia has a
viable plan for economic recovery but will also try to gague the
impact of Yeltsin's health problems on Russia's overall stability.
	   Primakov, the former foreign minister, has been prime minister
for only six weeks and has yet to produce his own blueprint to deal
with the country's deep-rooted economic problems.
	   He is, however, widely respected by all political factions and
is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when Yeltsin has

	   Yeltsin authorized him to tell EU officials about the
government's plan to cope with the latest economic crisis,
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Russia's economic crisis, coupled with major downturns in East
Asia and Latin America, has sent shock waves through Europe at a
time when EU governments have taken a major turn to the left.
	   During their summit last weekend in Poertschach, Austria, the
EU's 15 leaders pledged to coordinate economic policies to cope
with financial crises in Russia and elsewhere.
	   The Europeans, however, have made clear that Russia must stick
by its reform course if it is to expect international help to
overcome the crisis.

New Hong Kong airport costs eating into earnings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Cathay Pacific is looking for ways to
boost efficiency and productivity as costs related to the opening
of Hong Kong's new airport eat into earnings, chief executive
Philip Chen said Tuesday.
	   Chen, speaking at a briefing for the relaunch of the airline's
service between Hong Kong and Vietnam, said terminal, landing and
parking charges are all substantially higher at Hong Kong
International Airport, which opened in July.
	   He provided no specifics but said the added charges ``will eat
into the bottom line, especially given the slim margins right
now.''
	   ``It's an accepted fact that yield pressure in the coming six
months to one year will be no less than what we have experienced
lately,'' he said.
	   Cathay Pacific also has invested in a new headquarters, expected
to be finished by the end of the year, and in catering facilities
at the airport on outlying Lantau Island.
	   Chen did not rule out more layoffs, noting ``you can never say
`never,''' but said there ``is no plan to do anything like what we
did in January.''
	   In January, Cathay Pacific laid off nearly 760 people. It
subsequently made further staff cuts and urged belt-tightening by
managers.
	   Chen said the airline will look for other ways to increase
productivity and efficiency.
	   ``We've been pushing electronic ticketing for the last few
months and it will continue to be pushed,'' Chen said. He said the
company will be ``looking closely'' at distribution costs but that
it has no plans to cut commissions paid to travel agents.
	   The airline also expects reduced costs and improved efficiency
through participation in a new international alliance to start in
February with American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas and
Canadian Airlines, among others.

for only six weeks and has yet to produce his own blueprint to deal
with the country's deep-rooted economic problems.
	   He is, however, widely respected by all political factions and
is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when Yeltsin has
receded into the background.
	   Before leaving Moscow, Primakov held talks with Yeltsin at the
president's country residence outside of Moscow, Yeltsin's press
service said.
	   Yeltsin authorized him to tell EU officials about the
government's plan to cope with the latest economic crisis,
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Russia's economic crisis, coupled with major downturns in East
Asia and Latin America, has sent shock waves through Europe at a
time when EU governments have taken a major turn to the left.
	   During their summit last weekend in Poertschach, Austria, the
EU's 15 leaders pledged to coordinate economic policies to cope
with financial crises in Russia and elsewhere.
	   The Europeans, however, have made clear that Russia must stick
by its reform course if it wants international help to overcome the
crisis.

Ukraine President arrives on oficial visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Ukraine President Leonid Kuchma arrived
Tuesday for an official two-day visit.
	   He is to meet with President Arpad Goencz, Prime Minister Viktor
Orban and other dignitaries, as well as visit Szekesfehervar,
Hungary's ``Silicon Valley,'' where he will look up the Philips and
Videoton plants.
	   The Ukraine become independent with the breakup of the Soviet
Union, but economically remains closely tied to the east.
	   ``Forty percent of Ukraine's foreign trade is with Russia, so
it's difficult to distance ourselves from the impact of the Russian
crisis,'' Kuchma told Magyar Nemzet, a Budapest daily in an
interview Monday.
	   The situation makes it imperative for the Ukraine to seek to
open to the West.``We do not need credits, but access to markets,''
Kuchma told the daily.
	   Hungary enjoyed a trade surplus of dlrs 5.3 million with the
Ukraine in the first eight months of this year, while last year
there was a deficit of dlrs 69 million.
	   Seven bilateral agreements are to be signed during Kuchma's
visit.

Foreign office, independent committee clash over Hajj arrangments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The Indian foreign office is clashing
with one of its own committees _ a group that oversees arrangements
for the thousands of Indian Muslims who make the annual pilgrimage
to Mecca, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The Indian Express said the Ministry of External Affairs sent a
memo to the prime minister questioning the financial practices of
members of the Bombay-based Hajj Committee. The committee organizes
transportation and accommodation at subsidized prices for Indians
making the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to the Saudi holy city that
is required at least once of every able-bodied Muslim who can
afford it.
	   The Express said it had obtained a copy of the ministry's
complaints, which included accusations that committee members were
using their status to fly relatives free to Saudi Arabia and not
accounting for their own expenses for which they were charging the
government. The Express quoted the documents as saying the ministry
had no evidence on which to base a formal complaint.
	   A ministry spokesman contacted by The Associated Press could not
confirm that any memo had been sent.
	   Hajj Committee Executive Officer Shabi Ahmad told The Associated
Press that the charges were baseless. He said the committee's 19
members had received permission from the Ministry of External
Affairs for all their travel.
	   Ahmad said the real problem was that external affairs wanted a
new committee named, but that that process had been stalled in the
bureaucracy. The ministry spokesman said the committee needed fresh
faces, noting the current committee members had already served two
years longer that the normal three-year tenure. Service extensions
are not unusual.
	   More than 2 million Muslims perform the hajj every year, half of
them from abroad and half from Saudi Arabia. Some 100,000 come from
predominately Hindu India, where Muslims make up the largest
minority and one of the largest communities of Muslims in the world
at about 12 percent of the population of 980 million.

Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. abandons anti-takeover plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co. abandoned a plan Tuesday to prevent a hostile takeover, in what
analysts believe is a prelude to a foreign company taking a sizable
stake in the country's largest telecommunications company.
	   After months of speculation, the only serious contender for a
sizable stake in PLDT appears to be Hong Kong-based holding group
First Pacific Co., which already has substantial interests in the
Philippines, the analysts said.
	   In dropping the ``poison pill'' plan, PLDT said it considered
the need to protect the interests of minority shareholders and what
it termed ``the free play of market forces.''
	   Recent gains in PLDT's share price have been spurred by
expectations that First Pacific, which also has other
telecommunications holdings in Asia, has management control in its
sights.
	   ``It's a win-win situation,'' said Edward Teodoro, an analyst at
Securities 2000 Inc., noting that buying into PLDT would strengthen
First Pacific's presence in the telecommunications sector.
	   PLDT would benefit from fresh strategies that would be
implemented by a new management, added Neil Juggins, Paribas Asia
Equity Securities Inc.'s Singapore-based telecommunications
analyst.
	   No mention of First Pacific or any other bidder was made in
PLDT's brief statement on scuttling the plan. PLDT's shares closed
at 940 pesos (dlrs 22.80), up 10 pesos.
	   Its shares have swung wildly since Sept. 3, when management
announced a plan to sell discounted shares to existing investors
should an outsider acquire more than 10 percent of the voting
stock. The plan would punish predators by diluting the value of
their holdings.
	   Teodoro said the market has fully discounted the rumors of an
agreement between PLDT and First Pacific, and it is unlikely the
stock will see any further gains.
	   Even confirmation from First Pacific that it intends to acquire
a large stake in PLDT is unlikely to provide a strong boost to the
stock, other analysts said.
	   First Pacific has declined to comment on the rumors, which focus
on the Hong-Kong group buying into PLDT by acquiring shares held by
the Philippine government.
	   The Social Security System, a state pension fund, holds 10.3
percent of PLDT, and it is understood other government agencies
also have stakes in the company.
	   PLDT's biggest shareholder is the Philippine Telecommunications
Investment Corp., which holds an estimated 21 percent stake in
PLDT. PTIC is owned by the family of PLDT President Antonio
Cojuangco.
	   Those shares, however, were seized by the government of Corazon
Aquino in the late 1980s on allegations that the Cojuangco family
was holding the PLDT shares for former dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   The government has not included its PTIC stake among the state
holdings earmarked for privatization since the shares are the
subject of an ownership dispute.
	   A shakeup in PLDT's management is expected by analysts if First
Pacific ends up with a substantial stake in the company.

24 killed when runaway train hits Russian bus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to give reason as negligence, ADDS details in grafs
3-4, Interfax figures in new final graf.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Transport officials said Tuesday that negligence
caused five wagons to break away from a train and collide with a
bus in the Russian Far East, killing 24 people.
	   The bus was split in half when the rail cars carrying concrete
panels and other construction materials rammed into it at an
unmanned railroad crossing in Khabarovsk, about 6,100 kilometers
(3,800 miles) southeast of Moscow on Monday, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The wagons had broken off from a train that was standing idle
about two kilometers (1.2 miles) away at a loading station. They
accelerated down a hill to between 60-80 kmph (37-50 mph) by the
time they hit the bus, ripping it in two and dragging one section
for 200 meters (660 feet).
	   Police were investigating the engineer of the locomotive that
had pulled the wagons. Someone did not secure them properly when
the train was idle, officials said.
	   The bus was carrying 50 passengers, including eight children
between the ages of 11 and 14, ITAR-Tass said, quoting a duty
officer at the Emergency Situations Ministry.
	   Twenty-one people died instantly and three more died later in a
hospital, ITAR-Tass said. The others received injuries of varying
seriousness.
	   The Interfax news agency said, however, that 49 people had been
on the bus and 21 of them were killed.

Philippine peso closes at four-month high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso finished stronger
Tuesday, closing at a four-month high of 41 pesos to the dollar on
a steady stream of foreign-exchange inflows.
	   Stocks ended mixed as most issues succumbed to profit-taking on
recent gains, although bargain hunting in selected blue chips
lifted the main index.
	   The dollar averaged 41.22 pesos for the day, down from Monday's
average of 41.806 pesos. The last two deals were for a total dlrs
1.5 million at 41 pesos.
	   Volume ballooned to dlrs 286.5 million from the previous
session's dlrs 187 million.
	   Traders said the dollar's major support of 41 pesos will likely
be breached Wednesday as demand wanes and foreign exchange inflows
from overseas Filipino workers and for stock investments increase.
	   The dollar was last dealt below 41 pesos on June 22.
	   The Philippine Central Bank has projected a 10 percent increase
in remittances by overseas Filipinos from dlrs 5.7 billion last
year, while the stock market is steadily picking up as interest
rates decline.
	   Some banks, one trader said, were already shorting the dollar on
expectations foreign exchange inflows will rise further.
	   Aside from the steady inflows, traders said the peso is trying
to mirror the recent gains of other currencies, such as the Thai
baht, which used to be weaker against the dollar compared with the
peso. The dollar was at 37.425 baht Tuesday.
	   ``We're trying to play catch up with other currencies in the
region,'' said a trader for a foreign bank.
	   The central bank wasn't active in the spot market and kept its
overnight borrowing and lending rates unchanged at 13.75 percent
and 15.75 percent, respectively.
	   In stock trading, the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index
rose 6.10 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,592.50, extending a
62.42-point gain on Monday.
	   Decliners, however, outnumbered gainers 73 to 51, while 33
issues were unchanged.
	   The main index has risen 124.81 points, or 8.5 percent, since
Oct. 21.
	   Dealers said the market got off to a strong start Tuesday, with
the main index climbing 42 points before profit-taking eroded most
of the early gains.
	   ``It was prudent for investors to start cashing in on gains made
in the past sessions,'' said Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice president of
Diversified Securities Inc. ``We were due for a correction.''
	   Philippine Long Distance Telephone shares closed up 10 pesos, or
1.1 percent, at 940 pesos on persistent speculation it is set to
sign a deal with Hong Kong's First Pacific, under which the latter
will acquire a substantial stake in the telecommunications company.
	   Both companies declined to comment.
	   Shortly after the market closed Tuesday, PLDT announced it has
shelved a shareholders' rights plan that was designed to repel
possible hostile takeovers.
	   Garcia said profit-taking may continue to weigh on overbought
Manila shares in the next few sessions, but investors left behind
by the recent rally may take advantage of price dips and accumulate
fundamentally sound issues.
	   ``The market correction may not last long. For as long as the
peso remains strong, we should see shares eventually moving
higher,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT ARBA, West Bank (AP) _ Rabbis leading a tearful funeral
procession for a Jewish settler killed by suspected Palestinian
militants demanded Tuesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
go back on his promise to withdraw from West Bank land.
	   ``Mister prime minister, fix what you have ruined. There is
still time for repentance,'' said Rabbi Eliezer Waldman, a
spiritual leader of the Kiryat Arba settlement, where the victim,
29-year-old Danny Vargas, lived.
	   Some 1,500 mourners, many with tears streaming down their
cheeks, walked quietly behind the hearse passing through the
settlement just outside the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   Vargas' killing Monday in the nearby West Bank town of Hebron
put the new Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement to a first test. A
centerpiece of the agreement is a pledge by the Palestinians to
work harder to prevent attacks on Israel and rein in militants.
	   In a sign of change, Palestinian security forces cooperated with
their Israeli counterparts in trying to catch Vargas' killers who
fled into the Palestinian-run sector of divided Hebron.
	   However, Israeli troops also imposed a curfew on the area in
downtown Hebron they control, barring some 30,000 Palestinians
there from leaving their homes. The army also sealed the city, and
Palestinians were not allowed to enter or leave.
	   The restrictions embittered many Palestinians who had hoped that
life would improve as a result of the peace agreement.
	   ``We thought that we could now go to Gaza, but we cannot even
leave our homes,'' said Hebron resident Khalil Jaberi, 26,
referring to a provision in the accord for a new land route for
Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip. embittered many
P In the northern West Bank, meanwhile, hundreds of Palestinians
clashed with Israeli troops on the outskirts of the Balata and
Askar refugee camps to protest Monday's killing of a 65-year-old
Palestinian whose body was found outside a Jewish settlement. s
fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse Palestinian stone
throwers, and two Palestinians were injured.
	   Monday's victim, Mohammed Zalmout, was bludgeoned to death, and
Israeli police received an anonymous call saying his body could be
found near the gate of the Itamar settlement. Israeli police
reportedly were searching for a suspect, a young Israeli man.
	   In several West Bank towns, meanwhile, the Fatah group of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat enforced a general strike to press
demands for the trial and execution of Palestinian military
intelligence agents responsible for the death of a Fatah activist.
	   In the town of Nablus, Fatah supporters fired in the air and
burned tires in a show of force.
	   The dispute The dispute began Sunday when military intelligence
raided Fatah offices in the West Bank town of Ramallah, seizing
files and weapons. When Fatah activists threw stones in protest,
military intelligence opened fire, killing 16-year-old Wissam
Tarifi.
	   Fatah leaders want Tarifi's killers to be tried and executed.
They also seek the ouster of the head of military intelligence,
Moussa Arafat, a distant relative of the Palestinian leader.
	   Arafat is abroad and will only return on Wednesday. He needs
Fatah's support to shape public opinion and he may have to act
quickly to quell the growing rebellion of his loyalists.
	   In a similar case in August, Fatah demanded that Arafat order
the execution of two Palestinian policemen convicted of killing two
Fatah activists in a personal dispute. Arafat complied and ordered
the defendants be sent before a firing squad in the first execution
in the autonomous areas.

Serb forces redeploy in Kosovo as NATO deadline nears
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Serb claims withdrawal complete &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic, facing
a NATO deadline Tuesday, has made a significant last-minute
pullback of his military and police forces in Kosovo in order to
avert NATO airstrikes.
	   The private radio station B-92 quoted Serb sources as saying
Tuesday the withdrawal was complete and that government forces in
Kosovo were back to the level before Milosevic launched his
crackdown against ethnic Albanian militants Feb. 28.
	   International observers were out in force Tuesday in the
majority Albanian province to verify those claims. U.S. officials
in Washington say the U.S. government wants verification before
declaring that Milosevic had satisfied the terms of the deal he
accepted to end the crisis.
	   ``We want to make sure the movements are a real withdrawal and
not a reconfiguration (of forces),'' said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
	   The 16-nation NATO alliance has threatened to launch airstrikes
unless Milosevic halts his crackdown and cuts his forces to levels
in place before the conflict began.
	   ``They're going down to the wire,'' said Shaun Byrnes, head of
the American section of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission,
which has been monitoring the situation since July. ``It's been the
pattern.''
	   Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 have been driven from
their homes in seven months of fighting since Milosevic launched
the crackdown.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and
most want independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Convoys of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks carrying
Yugoslav troops and police departed several areas ahead of the 1900
gmt deadline for compliance in this southern province.
	   According to observers, the forces were headed to their barracks
or back to Serbia.
	   ``They need to pull more people out of Kosovo to satisfy the
agreement,'' Byrnes said at the end of a strenuous day of
patrolling and observing Monday. He said observers will be out in
force Tuesday to see whether Milosevic is complying.
	   The observer mission is the spearhead of what will become up to
2,000 ``ground verifiers'' under the command of the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Kosovo's Serb governor, Veljko Odalovic, thanked the police for
``bringing peace to Kosovo'' and pledged the province will be
defended from ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' with or without the
police.
	   In Kosovo's central Drenica region on Monday, tanks withdrew
from roadside positions where they had dug in since Oct. 18.
Several police checkpoints were vacant, including one in Malisevo _
scene of the latest fighting. All that remained was a tattered
Serbian flag hung over a pile of bricks.
	   At another checkpoint, in Dragobilje, which was occupied by
heavily armed Serb police a few days earlier, a uniformed ethnic
Albanian guerrilla stood holding an automatic rifle.
	   The real test of the pullback will be if refugees begin
returning to their homes. Most say they won't go home until Serb
police leave their villages. So far, returns have been a trickle.
	   A NATO source in Brussels, Belgium, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the alliance's ambassadors probably would wait
until shortly before the deadline to declare whether Milosevic met
the conditions.
	   He said NATO was still prepared to use military force if
necessary. The deadline has already been extended once since
Milosevic agreed to the peace plan.
	   NATO and the U.N. Security Council have also demanded that
Milosevic allows international organizations to deliver
humanitarian aid to the Kosovo refugees without interference.

	   The restrictions embittered many Palestinians who had hoped that
life would improve as a result of the peace agreement.
	   ``We thought that we could now go to Gaza, but we cannot even
leave our homes,'' said Hebron resident Khalil Jaberi, 26,
referring to a provision in the accord for a new land route for
Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   In the northern West Bank, meanwhile, hundreds of Palestinians
clashed with Israeli troops on the outskirts of the Balata and
Askar refugee camps to protest Monday's killing of a 65-year-old
Palestinian whose body was found outside a Jewish settlement.
	   Soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse
Palestinian stone throwers, and two Palestinians were injured.
	   Monday's victim, Mohammed Zalmout, was bludgeoned to death, and
Israeli police received an anonymous call saying his body could be
found near the gate of the Itamar settlement. Israeli police
reportedly were searching for a suspect, a young Israeli man.
	   In several West Bank towns, meanwhile, the Fatah group of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat enforced a general strike to press
demands for the trial and execution of Palestinian military
intelligence agents responsible for the death of a Fatah activist.
	   In the town of Nablus, Fatah supporters fired in the air and
burned tires in a show of force.
	   The dispute The dispute began Sunday when military intelligence
raided Fatah offices in the West Bank town of Ramallah, seizing
files and weapons. When Fatah activists threw stones in protest,
military intelligence opened fire, killing 16-year-old Wissam
Tarifi.
	   Fatah leaders want Tarifi's killers to be tried and executed.
They also seek the ouster of the head of military intelligence,
Moussa Arafat, a distant relative of the Palestinian leader.
	   Arafat is abroad and will only return on Wednesday. He needs
Fatah's support to shape public opinion and is expected to move
quickly to quell the growing rebellion of his loyalists.
	   In a similar case in August, Fatah demanded that Arafat order
the execution of two Palestinian policemen convicted of killing two
Fatah activists in a personal dispute. Arafat complied and ordered
the defendants be sent before a firing squad in the first execution
in the autonomous areas.

Details of ASEAN satellite television channel unveiled in

Singapore &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Southeast Asian officials said Tuesday a
satellite television channel representing their countries' unique
perspectives will be launched next year, as the beleaguered region
seeks a unified voice amid increasing internal discord.
	   Senior information officials from the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations met in Singapore for two days to hammer out
operational and financial details for the unprecedented satellite
network.
	   The channel will broadcast six to eight hours a day of programs
contributed by member countries, the ASEAN Committee on Culture and
Information said in a statement.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   The programs will include news and current affairs,
entertainment, lifestyle, sports and education shows. ASEAN members
will rebroadcast the channel domestically, through local cable or
broadcast operators.
	   Singapore International Media, the government-controlled company
that owns all of the city-state's television and radio stations,
has been appointed the network coordinator.
	   Officials also agreed that each member country would help pay
for operating the channel with fixed annual contributions. Details
of total operating costs were not disclosed.
	   ``This channel is to enable the ASEAN countries to project their
points of view to the region and beyond,'' said the statement.
	   Many ASEAN members _ notably Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore and
Vietnam _ exercise tight control over news and information
distributed within their countries, and have complained that
Western cultural influences are having a harmful impact.
	   While the television network could act as a unifying force for
the troubled region, which is suffering through its worst economic
crisis in decades, it arrives amid growing discord between members.
	   Presidents Joseph Estrada of the Philippines and B.J. Habibie of
Indonesia have openly criticized the treatment of jailed Malaysian
dissident Anwar Ibrahim, who was sacked by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad last month. Mahathir has publicly lashed out at this
``interference.''
	   Malaysia has also been embroiled in a series of disagreements
with neighboring Singapore, over perennial issues like land
disputes and the supply of water, and over recent irritants
including the relocation of a border checkpoint and alleged
military aerial intrusions.
	   Previously sacrosanct ASEAN policies of quiet diplomacy and
non-intervention in one another's domestic affairs have been
questioned recently by some of the nations, principally Thailand
and the Philippines.
	   They argue that honest and forthright statements on issues such
as human rights in ASEAN are necessary to advance the region into
the next century.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduras braced for potential
catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch roared through the northwest
Caribbean, churning up high waves and intense rain that sent
coastal residents scurrying for safer ground.
	   President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum
alert and the Honduran military sent planes to pluck residents from
their homes on islands near the coast.
	   At 0900 GMT Tuesday, Mitch was 95 miles (152 kilometers) north
of Honduras, near the Swan Islands. With winds near 180 mph (289
kph), and even higher gusts, it was a Category 5 monster _ the
highest, most dangerous rating for a storm. The 350-mile
(560-kilometer) wide hurricane was moving west at 8 mph (12 kph).
	   ``Mitch is closing in,'' said Monterrey Cardenas, mayor of
Utila, an island 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the Honduran coast.
``And God help us.''
	   Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States,
forecasters said, but was expected to remain in the northwest
Caribbean for five days.
	   The U.S. National Weather Service in Miami said Mitch could
weaken somewhat, but warned it would still remain ``a very
dangerous hurricane capable of causing catastrophic damage.''
	   The entire coast of Honduras was under a hurricane warning and
up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain was forecast in mountain
areas.
	   The Honduran president closed schools and public offices on the
coast Monday and ordered all air force planes and helicopters to
evacuate people from the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small
islands off the country's central coast.
	   The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco,
said 5,000 soldiers were standing by to help victims of the storm,
but he warned the military could not reach everyone.
	   ``For that humanitarian work, we would need more than 300
Hercules C-137 planes,'' he said. ``Honduras doesn't have them.''
	   A hurricane warning was also in effect for the Caribbean coast
of Guatemala.
	   In Belize, a hurricane watch was in place and the government
also closed schools and sent workers home early Monday. Panic
buying stripped bread from the shelves of some stores and some
gasoline stations ran dry. Coastal Belize City was hit so hard by
Hurricane Hattie in 1961 that the country built a new capital
inland at Belmopan.
	   Mexico mobilized troops and emergency workers Monday on the east
coast of the Yucatan peninsula, which was also under a hurricane
watch, and Cuba said it had evacuated 600 vacationers from the
Island of Youth.
	   Jerry Jarrell, the weather center director, said Mitch was the
strongest hurricane to strike the Caribbean since 1988, when
Gilbert killed more than 300 people.
	   In La Ceiba, on Honduras' northern coast, people stood in long
lines at filling stations Monday to buy gasoline under a steady
rain.
	   Maria Gonzalez said she needed the gas to cook with when her
firewood gets wet. Still, she bought only 37 cents worth _ all she
could afford.
	   ``I have six children, and we live in a riverbed,'' she said.
``If it gets really bad, we'll go to the church and see what the
architect of the world has in store for us.''
	   Swinwick Jackson, a fisherman on Utila, had tied up his boats
and was taking his family to stay with a relative on higher ground.
	   National police spokesman Ivan Mejia said the Coco, Segovia and
Cruta rivers all overflowed their banks Monday along Honduras'
eastern coast. ``Frightened people are moving into the mountains to
search for shelter,'' he said.
	   In El Progreso, 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Honduran
capital of Tegucigalpa, the army evacuated more than 5,000 people
who live in low-lying banana plantations along the Ulua River, said
Nolly Soliman, a resident.
	   Before bearing down on Honduras, Mitch swept past Jamaica and
the Cayman Islands. Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican
capital, Kingston, and government offices and schools closed in the
Caymans, a British colony of 28,000 people.
	   The strongest hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory was
Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras' Caribbean coast, killing at
least 2,000 people.

Asian stock markets closed mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with
prices falling in Tokyo for a third consecutive session, but
surging in Singapore on expectations of further interest rate cuts.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average moved in and
out of negative territory before finally closing down 22.78 points,
or 0.16 percent, at 13,820.68. On Monday, the average had lost
301.24 points, or 2.13 percent.
	   The market rose in early trading after Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi instructed his Cabinet to compile a package of economic
stimulus measures by Nov. 16. The new spending package, expected to
total at least 10 trillion yen (dlrs 84 billion), will likely form
the core of another supplementary budget, the third such
appropriation measure so far this year.
	   But the gain proved short-lived amid uncertainty about details
of the plan and concern it will tilt heavily toward public works
spending instead of tax cuts.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 119.36 yen in late
afternoon, up 0.34 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its
New York rate of 119.10 yen in late trading overnight.
	   Singapore shares closed sharply higher, with the key index
surging 40.10 points, or 3.6 percent, to 1,153.60.
	   Expectations of at least another half-point cut in local
interest rates by the end of the year fueled the frenzied buying on
the bourse, dealers said.
	   Singapore's major banks lowered their prime lending rate by a
quarter percentage point to 7 percent a few weeks ago, the second
round of cuts in less than a month.
	   South Korean shares slumped 3.5 percent in reaction to the rise
of the dollar against the Japanese currency. A weaker yen means
that South Korean exporters lose price competitiveness against
their Japanese rivals in the global market.
	   The Korean Composite stock Price Index fell 12.89 points to
360.43.
	   Elsewhere:
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed higher on futures-related buying.
The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 148.14 points, or 1.5 percent,
to 9,927.05, its highest close since May 12.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed slightly lower. The market's key
Weighted Stock Price Index fell 13.69 points, or 0.2 percent, to
7,036.63.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher as the local
market reacted favorably to rises in key forestry stocks and market
heavyweight Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. The NZSE-40 Capital
Index rose 26.92 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,870.37.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed mixed as most issues succumbed
to profit-taking on recent gains. The 30-share Philippine Stock
Exchange Index rose 6.10 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,592.50.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher. The All
Ordinaries Index rose 19.6 point, or 0.7 percent, to 2,582.9.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower on a lack of
buying support. The benchmark Composite Index fell 3.15 points, or
0.7 percent, to 415.96.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed slightly higher, with the key index
pushed up by late buying in some big capitalization stocks. The
Composite Index rose 2.790 points, or 0.8 percent, to 318.101.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed mixed. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand index edged up 0.21 point to 319.23.

German joblessness to continue slight dip, top labor official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German joblessness will continue its
slight improvement in October, remaining under 4 million for the
second month in a row, the government's top labor official said
Tuesday.
	   ``Just as in September, we'll once again be lucky enough to come
in under 4 million,'' Bernhard Jagoda, the head of the Federal
Labor Office in Nuremberg, told MDR radio in Leipzig.
	   The average unemployment rate for 1998 as a whole also will
probably come in slightly lower than last year, Jagoda said.
	   In September, joblessness dropped to 3.96 million, or 10.3
percent, the lowest in two years. In September 1997, 11.2 percent
of Germans were out of work.
	   Jagoda said the situation would improve again slightly next
year, with another 200,000 people expected to find jobs.
	   Jagoda also pledged support for the incoming government's
planned ``Alliance for Jobs,'' though he expected results to be
slow. The program intends to bring together unions, industry,
government and even clergy to brainstorm on jobs creation.
	   ``I think that one accomplishes more by talking than through
confrontation,'' Jagoda said.
	   Yet he noted a similar initiative begun in the mid-1980s in the
Netherlands was only just beginning to bear fruit. ``I don't know
if we Germans are that patient,'' he said.
	   Germany's chronic high joblessness is in part a result of
economic dislocation after the country was unified in 1990.
	   Joblessness in the former communist East Germany is a whopping
16.3 percent, while in the former West Germany it is 8.8 percent,
close to the European average.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Two bombs in two hours rocked the port
city of Karachi on Tuesday wounding at least 21 people, police
said.
	   The first bomb stashed inside a small police post outside the
southern Sindh provincial legislature wounded 13 people. Originally
police said only four people were injured in that explosion, but
later it was learned from hospital sources that the injured was 13.
	   The second bomb, hidden beneath a vehicle, exploded outside the
provincial government's information department, barely one
kilometer (mile) from the first explosion. The bomb left a large
crater in its wake.
	   At least eight people were wounded in that explosion that blew
out the windows of a nearby six-story building and sprayed glass on
the busy street below. Many of the injures were caused by flying
debris.
	   At least 10 vehicles were destroyed in that blast, which was so
powerful it ripped wiring out of electricity poles.
	   Although no one took responsibility for the explosions, police
fear it is part of the feud between rival factions of an ethnic
group, the Muttaheda Qami Movement.
	   Factional fighting has terrorized residents of Karachi, the
Sindh provincial capital.
	   Since the beginning of the year factional fighting has left as
many as 1,000 people dead, including several police officers.
	   The violence in Karachi has prompted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
to deploy another 10,000 policemen to patrol the troubled streets.
Currently Karachi has 28,000 policemen and thousands of
paramilitary Rangers.
	   The MQM represents Indian Muslims who settled in Pakistan after
the British left the Asian subcontinent in 1947. The rivalry is
largely a territorial war with both factions trying to impose their
control over parts of Pakistan's largest city of Karachi, teeming
with 14 million people.

State banker: Russia can pay foreign debts this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will be able to make all payments on its
foreign debt this year, the chairman of the state-controlled bank
involved with debts said Tuesday.
	   Russia will have to pay about dlrs 3 billion toward its foreign
debt this year and about dlrs 18 billion next year, said Andrei
Kostin, chairman of the Vneshekonombank, or Bank of Foreign
Economic Activity.
	   The head of the Russian parliament's budget committee, Alexander
Zhukov, said Monday the government will owe dlrs 17.5 billion in
foreign debt in 1999, but won't have the revenues to pay it.
	   ``If the government decides it cannot make foreign debt payments
next year, it should say so in advance,'' Kostin said, according to
the Interfax news agency. ``There is no question of nonpayments at
present.''
	   Russia is trying to restructure its domestic debt, payments on
which were frozen when the financial crisis erupted in mid-August.
Talks in London with foreign banks did not produce any
breakthroughs last week. The foreign banks fear they will be
offered less attractive repayment terms than Russians.
	   Kostin denied, meanwhile, that Russia's talks with the Paris and
London Clubs of creditor countries will focus on a second
restructuring of the former Soviet debt. A Russian government
delegation led by Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was
scheduled to meet with the Paris Club in France on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   International lenders and debtors have been concerned about the
lack of a plan to boost revenues and slash spending, six weeks
after Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov took office.
	   Senior Cabinet ministers finally approved a plan to deal with
the economic crisis at a meeting on Monday. The government refused
to release details, but Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants
said Monday it is likely to favor industrial giants.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist who
wrote the plan, said it will be shown to the International Monetary
Fund after it is approved by the full Cabinet on Saturday.
	   The IMF has said it wants to see a sound economic plan
implemented before releasing more of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout
package negotiated during the summer.

China detains democracy activists in crackdown

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ One of China's most prominent democracy
activists, his associate and as many as 13 other dissidents were
reported detained or missing Tuesday in a police crackdown just
weeks after China signed a key human rights treaty.
	   Police took veteran campaigner Xu Wenli away from his Beijing
home Tuesday morning, blocking his plan to set off on a
cross-country trip to protest the harassment of another dissident,
Xu's wife said.
	   Police also detained Xu's associate, Zhang Hui, and searched
Xu's home for two hours, confiscating a fax machine, papers,
magazines and photos, said Xu's wife, He Xintong.
	   She said the detentions demonstrated that authorities have no
intention of relaxing their grip despite China's Oct. 5 signing of
a U.N. human rights treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights.
	   ``This is their real face,'' she said in an interview. ``The
Communist Party says one thing but does another.''
	   Zhou Guoqiang, a dissident who planned to join Xu on his trip
Tuesday to eastern Shandong province, set off for Xu's house but
was not heard from again, said his wife, Wang Hui. She surmised he
had been detained.
	   Xu's wife said she also had no news of Cha Jianguo and Wang
Zhixin, two of Xu's friends who planned to make their own way to
Shandong. They did not phone Xu's wife as planned, which ``may mean
they have run into trouble,'' she said.
	   A Hong Kong-based rights group said four other dissidents were
detained Tuesday in Beijing and elsewhere, and that police also
questioned nearly 20 others, including many of those who planned to
travel to Shandong.
	   The group, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement, said that in all, some 40 dissidents have been detained
or questioned in the past three days. Assuming that those who were
missing have been detained, it said at least 15 people, including
Xu and his associate, were still being held as of Tuesday
afternoon.
	   A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said he was
unaware of the detentions. But he said China signed the U.N. pact
on civil and political rights to safeguard citizens' rights, and
remained determined to do so.
	   On Monday, before his detention, Xu said he and as many as 30
dissidents from Beijing and elsewhere in the country were going to
Shandong's Dongping County, some 450 kilometers (280 miles) south
of Beijing, to support Xie Wanjun, a fellow activist who has been
harassed.
	   Xie was detained last month and held for 15 days for attempting
to file an application with the authorities to set up an opposition
group, the China Democracy Party.
	   Since July, dissidents have tried to register branches of the
party in at least nine provinces and major cities, challenging a
virtual 49-year ban on organized opposition to the ruling Communist
Party.
	   Authorities rejected all the applications and detained at least
20 dissidents, mostly for brief periods.
	   Since his release, Xie has been ordered to leave his home by
Nov. 1, his wife has been sacked and his electricity and telephone
have been cut off, Xu's wife said.
	   Police sought to dissuade Xu from his trip, but he said Xie must
first be allowed to keep his house and his wife should get back her
job, said Xu's wife.
	   With many other dissidents exiled abroad, Xu, 56, is one of the
most prominent democracy campaigners left in China. Xu was jailed
after the Democracy Wall protest movement of the late 1970s and
freed in 1993, having served all but three years of a 15-year
sentence, much of it in solitary confinement.

Arafat's Fatah group enforces strike in West Bank towns

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ In a show of force, Yasser Arafat's
Fatah faction shut down several West Bank towns Tuesday to push for
the trial and execution of Palestinian intelligence agents who
killed a young Fatah activist in a clash this week.
	   In the West Bank town of Nablus, hundreds of Fatah activists
filled the streets and burned tires. Several marchers fired their
weapons in the air.
	   Fatah also enforced strikes in the towns of Bethlehem, Tulkarem
and in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. Shops were shuttered and
students were told to leave their schools.
	   The dispute began Sunday when members of the Palestinian
military intelligence raided the Fatah headquarters in the town of
Ramallah and seized weapons and files. A Fatah activist,
16-year-old Wassim Tarifi, was shot and killed by intelligence
agents during subsequent rock-throwing protests.
	   Fatah leaders want Tarifi's killers to be tried and executed.
They also seek the ouster of the head of military intelligence,
Moussa Arafat, a distant relative of the Palestinian leader.
	   Arafat is abroad and will only return on Wednesday. He needs
Fatah's support to shape public opinion and is expected to move
quickly to quell the growing rebellion of his loyalists.
	   A senior Arafat aide, Tayeb Abdel Rahim, said that Arafat has
already ordered the establishment of a special military tribunal
that would investigate the case and try the suspected shooters.
However, no one has been arrested yet in Tarifi's death.
	   In a similar case in August, Arafat complied with Fatah demands
and ordered the execution of two Palestinian policemen who had
killed two of the group's activists in a personal feud.

X-rays give away would-be draft dodger in Russian Far East.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ For one Russian trying to get out of the autumn
military draft on medical grounds, X-rays proved to be a little too
revealing.
	   The conscript in Russia's Pacific port city of Vladivostok hoped
his X-rays would prove to a doctor that he was not fit to serve in
Russia's army. But one glance by the doctor was enough to determine
they were X-rays of a female pelvis, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   The practice of submitting fake medical tests and X-rays showing
medical problems is widespread among recruits who want to get out
of service in the army, where conditions are miserable and older
soldiers brutally haze younger conscripts.
	   Only about 20 percent of the young men drafted into the military
actually show up.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT ARBA, West Bank (AP) _ Rabbis leading a tearful funeral
procession for a Jewish settler killed by suspected Palestinian
militants demanded Tuesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
go back on his promise to withdraw from West Bank land.
	   ``Mister prime minister, fix what you have ruined. There is
still time for repentance,'' said Rabbi Eliezer Waldman, a
spiritual leader of the Kiryat Arba settlement, where the victim,
29-year-old Danny Vargas, lived.
	   Some 1,500 mourners, many with tears streaming down their
cheeks, walked quietly behind the hearse passing through the
settlement just outside the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   Vargas' killing Monday in the nearby West Bank town of Hebron
put the new Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement to a first test. A
centerpiece of the agreement is a pledge by the Palestinians to
work harder to prevent attacks on Israel and rein in militants.
	   In a sign of change, Palestinian security forces cooperated with
their Israeli counterparts in trying to catch Vargas' killers who
fled into the Palestinian-run sector of divided Hebron.
	   However, Israeli troops also imposed a curfew on the area in
downtown Hebron they control, barring some 30,000 Palestinians
there from leaving their homes. The army also sealed the city, and
Palestinians were not allowed to enter or leave.
	   The restrictions embittered many Palestinians who had hoped the
peace agreement would improve their lives.
	   ``We thought that we could now go to Gaza, but we cannot even
leave our homes,'' said Hebron resident Khalil Jaberi, 26,
referring to a provision in the accord for a new land route for
Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   In the northern West Bank, meanwhile, hundreds of Palestinians
clashed with Israeli troops on the outskirts of the Balata and
Askar refugee camps to protest Monday's killing of a 65-year-old
Palestinian whose body was found outside a Jewish settlement.
	   Soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse
Palestinian stone throwers, and two Palestinians were injured.
	   Monday's victim, Mohammed Zalmout, was bludgeoned to death, and
Israeli police received an anonymous call saying his body could be
found near the gate of the Itamar settlement. Israeli police
reportedly were searching for a suspect, a young Israeli man.
	   In several West Bank towns, meanwhile, the Fatah group of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat enforced a general strike to press
demands for the trial and execution of Palestinian military
intelligence agents responsible for the death of a Fatah activist.
	   In the town of Nablus, Fatah supporters fired in the air and
burned tires.
	   The dispute The dispute began Sunday when military intelligence

	   Arafat return from abroad on Wednesday. He needs Fatah's support

	   In a similar case in August, Fatah demanded that Arafat order
the execution of two Palestinian policemen convicted of killing two
Fatah activists in a personal dispute. Arafat complied and ordered
the defendants be sent before a firing squad in the first execution
in the autonomous areas.

Electronics makers Toshiba, Hitachi announce losses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries earnings, last four
grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese electronics giant Toshiba Corp. posted
losses of more than dlrs 50 billion in the first half of fiscal
1998 _ the company's first dip into the red in nearly 50 years, the
company said Tuesday.
	   Hitachi Ltd., the country's largest electronics maker, also
announced losses for the half-year ended Sept. 30.
	   Toshiba posted a 6.4 billion yen (dlrs 53.6 million) parent
pretax loss for the latest six months, against a 25.4 billion yen
(dlrs 212 million) profit in the same period last year.
	   Toshiba also had a 6.4 billion yen (dlrs 53.6 million) parent
net loss for the half-year after posting a 22.45 billion yen (dlrs
188 million) profit the previous year.
	   Toshiba's parent sales were down 12.3 percent to 1.60 trillion
yen (dlrs 13.4 billion).
	   The company blamed its poor results on a drop in semiconductor
prices and slow demand for computers and consumer electronics. It
said the Asian financial crisis had cut into demand for memory
chips.
	   It was the first time the company had recorded pretax losses
since 1950, said company spokesman Kazuyoshi Ishiyama.
	   Hitachi recorded a parent pretax loss of 69.2 billion yen (dlrs
580 million) for the half-year compared to profits of 33.3 billion
yen (dlrs 279 billion) a year earlier.
	   The company recorded a parent net loss of 124.7 billion yen
(dlrs 1.04 billion) for the latest six months against a profit of
24.3 billion yen (dlrs 204 million) a year earlier.
	   Hitachi's parent sales were down 12 percent to 1.80 trillion yen
(dlrs 15.1 billion) from 2.05 trillion yen (dlrs 17.2 billion) the
previous year.
	   The company said the losses resulted from Japan's recession and
slumping semiconductor and consumer electronics sales.
	   Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Japan's largest
comprehensive heavy machinery maker, announced a sharp fall in
profits for the half-year.
	   Mitsubishi's parent pretax profits fell to 50.6 billion yen
(dlrs 424 million) from 74.31 billion yen (dlrs 622 million) a year
earlier.
	   Its parent net profit dropped to 29.29 billion yen (dlrs 245
million) from 43.3 billion yen (dlrs 363 million).
	   The company said orders fell as Japan's recession caused the
private sector to invest less in new factories and equipment.

German high court overturns Bavarian law limiting abortions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more from court ruling, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest court Tuesday tossed
out a Bavarian law that sought severe restrictions to access to
abortion in the state by limiting how much a doctor could earn from
the procedure.
	   The Constitutional Court voted 5-3 to declare the 1996 state law
unconstitutional, saying the states have not had jurisdiction to
regulate abortion since the passage of a 1995 federal law.
	   The Bavarian law was to have gone into effect last year but was
blocked by the high court pending its ruling.
	   The law stated that doctors in Bavaria may not derive more than
25 percent of their income from performing abortions. It also
required women to justify why they are seeking an abortion.
	   Officials of Bavaria's conservative ruling party, the Christian
Social Union, argue that doctors who are financially dependent on
performing abortions would be less likely to advise a pregnant
woman about other options.
	   Doctors must stress ``the protection of unborn life'' according
to a federal law requiring pre-abortion counseling. But while the
law outlaws most abortions, almost any woman can have one because
neither patients nor doctors who ignore the counseling are
punished.
	   Doctors challenging the Bavarian law charged it would only end
up inconveniencing women seeking abortions by making them travel
farther, possibly creating health risks.
	   Two doctors who together perform about 6,000 abortions a year _
two thirds of all abortions done in Bavaria _ also argued the law
would mean financial ruin for them.
	   Among other grounds, the Constitutional Court agreed with the
doctors that the law breached their freedom to exercise a
profession of their choice.

	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ National telephone carrier
Papua New Guinea Telikom said Tuesday that more than 4,000 computer
and telephone lines in Port Moresby's central business district
were cut in an act of sabotage.
	   A fiber optic cable carrying the lines was severed Monday night,
said a Telikom source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``Somebody must have tampered with the cable,'' the source told
Australian Associated Press.
	   Phone and postal services across the country have been disrupted
since last Friday by a strike by about 600 members of the
Communication Workers Union over superannuation entitlements and
demands for a 15 percent wage raise.
	   The Telikom source said the company had engaged a private
contractor to repair the fiber optic cable but it was not known how
long the repairs would take.
	   The source said the cutting of the cable had caused major
disruptions to banks, the national airline Air Niugini and many
other businesses, and was costing Telikom up to 1 million kina
(U.S. dlrs 450,000) a day in lost revenue.

	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ A Palestinian militant leader narrowly
escaped death Tuesday when he pulled his family away from his
booby-trapped car seconds before it exploded, witnesses said.
	   The car bombing wounded Mahmoud Majzoub, his wife Mona, their
4-year-old son and a man believed to be a Syrian passer-by,
security officials said.
	   They were admitted to a local hospital with burns and wounds
from bits of the blasted car. Hospital officials said all four were
in a ``stable'' condition.
	   The 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) blast also shattered windows of nearby
shops and damaged cars on a main road in east Sidon, 45 kilometers
(27 miles) south of Beirut.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing.
A local spokesman for Islamic Jihad, the group to which Majzoub
belongs, blamed Israel.
	   Witnesses told The Associated Press that Majzoub, 31, noticed
something was wrong as he was about to start his car, which was
parked outside his house. He told his wife and child to get out and
ran for cover.
	   They were only meters (yards) away when the Volvo sedan
exploded, witnesses said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Explosives experts at the scene estimated the bomb to have been
made of 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) of TNT high explosive.
	   Majzoub is a senior member of Jihad in Sidon. He was born in the
city but, like some Lebanese, joined the Palestinian group which is
staunchly opposed to peace with Israel.
	   The group held a rally Sunday in Ein El-Hilweh, the large
Palestinian refugee camp outside Sidon, to mark the third
anniversary of the assassination of its leader, Fathi Shekaki.
Shekaki was gunned down outside a hotel in Malta in 1985 in a hit
widely blamed on Israeli agents.
	   Sidon, provincial capital of southern Lebanon, has seen a spate
of shootings in the past three months in which the victims were
often liquor store owners. On Saturday, two policemen were shot
dead by a gunman on a motorbike. Security officials believe Muslim
fundamentalist groups, seeking a ban on alcohol, could be behind
the attacks.
	   ``We are sure that these events in Sidon are part of an Israeli
plan to destabilize the situation in Lebanon and open a front to
distract from the agreement in Washington,'' said Jihad spokesman,
Abu Obeida, on Tuesday.
	   He was referring to the Israeli-Palestinian agreement signed
Friday in Washington by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Sri Lankan government and Tamil
separatist are looking for an opening to resume peace peace talks,
political analysts and government ministers said Tuesday.
	   The issue of resuming talks to end the 15-year-old Tamil
insurrection that has left an estimated 55,000 dead, 1 million
displaced and the economy in a shambles is politically so sensitive
that government ministers declined to speak on the record.
	   Privately they admit they are looking for an opening.
	   Before the government commits itself to talks with the main
rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, it will have to
obtain total backing of the main opposition United National Party.
Without opposition support, the administration will be unable to
offer concessions to the rebels. The governing People's Alliance
Party has only a one-seat majority in the 225-member Parliament.
	   Next month's visit by British envoy Derek Fatchett could be
crucial. Fatchett is a successor to Liam Fox, who helped the UNP
and the government reach an agreement in 1997 that later faltered.
	   Fatchett is coming to inaugurate a British trade fair, but local
reports say his schedule includes meeting with President Chandrika
Kumaratunga and UNP leader Ranil Wickramasinghe.
	   There are indications that the LTTE, which is now confined to
northern jungles and one northern town, may also be willing to
resume the dialogue they broke off in April 1995 by staging
surprise attacks.
	   Last weekend the LTTE freed six Sri Lankan soldiers after
holding them for about five years. The soldiers said they were
puzzled by the LTTE gesture.
	   ``The only reason I can even imagine is that they may have some
idea of wanting to have talks with the government,'' said one of
the freed men, Lance. Corp. D.E. Amarasinghe.
	   The LTTE said over its clandestine Voice of the Tigers radio
that the soldiers were released as a ``goodwill gesture.''
	   A top LTTE official said earlier this month that the group was
not against a dialogue. Citing the examples of Kosovo and Bosnia,
Tiger spokesman V. Rudrakumaran, a U.S.-based lawyer, told
Colombo's Midweek Mirror that any major Western power could bring
the two sides together to talk.
	   The government is hoping to persuade the LTTE, which is fighting
for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in the north and
the east, to agree instead to greater autonomy for Tamil-dominated
areas within a federal structure.
	   ``It is the only objective, well-developed approach which can
form the core of a political solution,'' Jehan Perera, director of
the Sri Lanka Peace Council, said. ``But to succeed there will be a
need for a total consensus among the political parties to start
with.''
	   Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's defense ministry said Tuesday its troops
killed 19 Tamil Tiger separatists and lost one policeman in battles
in the northeast.
	   Military spokesman Major Kumara Dewage said 12 of the fatalities
occurred near Kilinochchi on Monday. Kilinochchi, about 275
kilometers (170 miles) north of Colombo, was under government
control until rebels from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
captured the town last month.
	   Kilinochchi is the last major town on the northern stretch of a
highway that the government has been trying to capture for the past
year. They road is the only overland supply line from Colombo, the
capital, to government-held Jaffna Peninsula on the northern tip of
this Indian Ocean island.
	   Trincomalee, 230 kilometers (142 miles) northeast of Colombo, is
under government control, but rebels often carry out attacks from
nearby jungles.

Philippine president sacks official in charge of seeking Marcos

wealth &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
on Tuesday sacked the head of an agency responsible for recovering
the alleged ill-gotten wealth of the late dictator Ferdinand
Marcos.
	   Estrada said Felix de Guzman, chairman of the Presidential
Commission on Good Government, attempted to arbitrarily lift the
government's seizure of a 200 million peso (dlrs 4.88 million) bank
account of a company owned by a former Marcos aide.
	   The bank account of Hans Menzi Holdings and Management Inc. was
frozen soon after Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt in February
1986. Marcos was driven into exile in Hawaii, where he died three
years later.
	   The government claims Marcos and his associates illegally
amassed billions of dollars during his 20-year rule.
	   Estrada, who was close to Marcos, said the sacking of de Guzman
will ``serve as a warning to all government officials, especially
those holding high positions.''
	   ``Once I doubt their capability ... I will not think twice about
firing them or accepting their resignation,'' Estrada said.
	   In a letter to de Guzman, Estrada criticized the official for
his ``completely inappropriate and inexcusable attempt'' to
unfreeze the account.
	   Estrada said lifting the seizure required the authority of the
entire good government commission, which de Guzman had not
obtained.
	   ``In fact, it has repudiated your actions and asked that the
same be recalled,'' Estrada told de Guzman, a former judge.
	   ``We are not talking about a minor incident, or a small error in
judgment,'' he said. ``The amounts involved run into the hundreds
of millions of pesos, and a more judicious use of judgment would
have been called for from a person of your position and
responsibility.''
	   There was no immediate explanation of the unfreezing of the
account.
	   Estrada appointed commission member Alexander Gesmundo as new
head of the agency.

Vietnam to install 4,000 telephone booths
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ It's getting easier to find a pay phone in
Vietnam. But in a country that has no coins, make sure to buy a
calling card first.
	   A local phone company is working on the second phase of a
project designed to bring telephone booths to all of Vietnam's 61
provinces and major cities.
	   The first phase was finished in June and involved installation
of 581 booths in seven provinces, a company executive said Monday.
Another 3,405 telephone booths are being put in by early next year,
adding service to 18 more provinces.
	   The company is planning to add another 6,000 to bring the total
number of booths to 10,000, she said.
	   The company has imported ``smart card'' booths from France and
Japan, she said, while declining to specify the investment capital
for the project.
	   Cards are sold for 30,000 dong (dlrs 2.10), 50,000 dong (dlrs
3.40) and 150,000 dong (dlrs 10.20), with rates the same as for
fixed telephones, she said.
	   ``We are targeting all strata of people,'' she said. ``Even poor
people can afford to pay.''
	   Telephone booths were first introduced in Vietnam in a joint
venture with Malaysia's Sapura company in 1993.

Arafat's Fatah group enforces strike in West Bank towns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMMED DARAGMEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ In a show of force, Yasser Arafat's
Fatah faction shut down several West Bank towns on Tuesday to push
for the trial and execution of Palestinian intelligence agents who
killed a young Fatah activist in a clash this week.
	   In the West Bank town of Nablus, hundreds of Fatah activists
filled the streets and burned tires. Several marchers fired weapons
into the air.
	   Fatah also enforced strikes in the towns of Bethlehem, Tulkarem
and in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. Shops were shuttered and
students were told to leave their schools.
	   The dispute began Sunday when members of the Palestinian
military intelligence raided the Fatah headquarters in the town of
Ramallah and seized weapons and files. A Fatah activist,
16-year-old Wassim Tarifi, was shot and killed by intelligence
agents during subsequent rock-throwing protests.
	   Fatah leaders want Tarifi's killers to be tried and executed.
They also seek the ouster of the head of military intelligence,
Moussa Arafat, a distant relative of the Palestinian leader.
	   Arafat is abroad and will return later Tuesday. He needs Fatah's
support to shape public opinion and is expected to move quickly to
quell the growing rebellion of his loyalists.
	   A senior Arafat aide, Tayeb Abdel Rahim, said that Arafat has
already ordered the establishment of a special military tribunal
that would investigate the case and try the suspected shooters.
However, no one has been arrested yet in Tarifi's death.
	   In a similar case in August, Arafat complied with Fatah demands
and ordered the execution of two Palestinian policemen who had
killed two of the group's activists in a personal feud.

Saudi man's hand cut off for stealing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi authorities chopped off the
right hand of a man Tuesday for stealing at Islam's holiest site in
Mecca, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
	   Saeed bin Musalam al-Harthy was convicted of pickpocketing
worshipers praying in the Grand Mosque next to the Kabaa, the focal
point of Muslim prayers.
	   Al-Harthy's hand was cut off with a sword in the holy city of
Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, the agency said.
	   Last month, an Afghan man had his right hand cut off for
pickpocketing in the same mosque.
	   This was the fourth amputation this year. Earlier this month, an
Egyptian and a Saudi had their right hands amputated after they
were found guilty of stealing.
	   Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islamic law calls for
cutting off the right hand of thieves. Murderers, rapists, drug
traffickers and armed robbers are beheaded.
	   Executions and amputations are carried out with a sword in a
public square.
	   So far this year, Saudi Arabia has beheaded 22 people. Last year
124 people were executed.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ State-sponsored political violence has
displaced more than 500,000 Kenyans and killed at least 1,600 in
the past seven years, the Kenya Human Rights Commission said
Tuesday.
	   The violence was aimed at keeping in power President Daniel arap
Moi's ruling party, the Kenya African National Union, after
political pluralism was restored in 1991, said a commission report
titled ``Killing the Vote.''
	   It said since then ``a new phenomenon of state-sponsored, but
increasingly informal terrorism, has become a permanent feature.''
	   Kenyan authorities routinely decline comment on reports on human
rights violations.
	   The report said KANU took advantage of real grievances among
various ethnic groups over land and cattle rustling to create
``animosity between communities and split their political
inclinations.''
	   As a result, the report said politically instigated violence
preceded the 1992 and 1997 presidential elections to coerce people
to vote for KANU and followed the elections to punish those who
voted for the opposition.
	   Moi won the presidency both times and KANU retained a
parliamentary majority.
	   Between 1991 and 1996, at least 1,500 people were killed and
more than 300,000 forced to flee their homes by the violence, the
report said.
	   Most of the violence was in Moi's home province of Rift Valley
and pitted his Kalenjin tribe, which supports KANU, against the
Kikuyu, Luhya and Luo, who back the opposition.
	   In the run up to the 1997 presidential and general elections,
more than 100 people were killed and another 100,000 forced to flee
their homes along the Indian Ocean Coast Province, the report said.
	   The report accused KANU of engaging in ``depopulation of
opposition strongholds'' in 1992 and 1997 in order to deny the
opposition votes.
	   Numerous cases of politically instigated violence, displacements
and deaths were also reported in eastern and western Kenya during
the same periods, the report said.
	   It accused the government of ``employing surrogate agents''
instead of state security personnel and misleadingly characterizing
the violence as ethnic and land clashes.
	   ``The more successful the state is in depicting the clashes as
`ethnic' and `traditional' the more its role becomes concealed and
obscure,'' the report said.

Mining is destroying Aborigines' culture, representatives claim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JABIRU, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government has mounted a
systematic attack on the traditions of the Aboriginal people living
in Kakadu National Park, a U.N. team investigating whether uranium
mining threatens the park was told Tuesday.
	   The 27-member Aboriginal Mirrar clan strongly opposed the
building of the Jabiluka uranium mine on its traditional land, in
an area surrounded by Kakadu.
	   ``The Australian government has mounted a systematic and
sustained attack on the living tradition of the Mirrar and
Aboriginal people of Kakadu,'' Mirrar spokeswoman Jacqui Katona
told the U.N. delegation.
	   ``This attack on the political and social structures of
Aboriginal people has manifested itself in the form of massive
industrial development associated with uranium mining,'' Katona
said.
	   ``The Mirrar believe that the Australian government supports
mining at the expense of their very existence.''
	   She urged the U.N. group to put Kakadu on the list of world
heritage areas considered to be in danger.
	   The team from the U.N. World Heritage Bureau is visiting the
park to examine claims that the environmental and cultural values
of the park are being threatened by the Jabiluka mine.
	   It will meet with mining company Energy Resources of Australia
Ltd. and government representatives later this week.
	   The team will report in December to a meeting of the bureau in
Kyoto, Japan, where it will recommend whether to place the park on
a list of endangered world heritage sites.
	   If Kakadu is put on the ``in danger'' list _ joining the likes
of the old city of Jerusalem, Cambodia's Angkor temples, the
war-torn cities of Dubrovnik in Croatia and Timbuktu in the African
state of Mali _ the value of the park as a tourist attraction would
be reduced, Katona said.
	   Such a decision would prove a major international embarrassment
to the government of Prime Minister John Howard, which has
maintained that the removal of 20 million metric tons of
radioactive uranium ore over 28 years will not harm Kakadu.
	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers)
of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast,
incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile
(200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal
species, including many that are rare or endangered.
	   It is also home to Aborigines who have lived there continuously
for at least 40,000 years and is dotted with their cave paintings,
rock carvings and other archaeological sites.
	   The park is one of a handful of 552 World Heritage sites listed
for both its environmental and cultural values. About 200,000
tourists visit the park every year.

Subbing for ailing Yeltsin, Primakov arrives to brief EU on
</HEADLINE>
economic recovery plan
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Primakov, Klestil comments &QL; 
 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Substituting for an ailing Boris
Yeltsin, Russia's prime minister arrived Tuesday to brief the
European Union on economic recovery plans and seek help in coping
with Moscow's worst economic crisis of the post-Soviet era.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov made the one-day trip at the
head of a Russian delegation after doctors ordered the Russian
president to stay home. Yeltsin checked into a sanatorium Tuesday
for an unspecified ``course of restoration treatment,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Following official welcoming ceremonies with Austrian President
Thomas Klestil, Primakov met Prime Minister Viktor Klima; the head
of the European Commission Jacques Santer and EU Commissioner Hans
van den Broek.
	   Primakov was expected to ask for better access for Russian
products into EU markets to help the country revive its economy.
	   During his courtesy call on Klestil, Primakov praised Austria's
role as a neutral, non-NATO country, saying the ``neutral status of
Austria has helped not hurt'' it.
	   The Austria Press Agency said Klestil said he hoped Russia would
stick to the reform course, which would produce results ``which all
of us in Europe need.''
	   Primakov was accompanied to Vienna by Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and several other ministers in charge of economic and
financial policies.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency. Klima and
the others will be seeking not only assurances that Russia has a
viable plan for economic recovery but will also try to gague the
impact of Yeltsin's health problems on Russia's overall stability.
	   Primakov, the former foreign minister, has been prime minister
for only six weeks and has yet to produce his own blueprint to deal
with the country's deep-rooted economic problems.
	   He is, however, widely respected by all political factions and
is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when Yeltsin has
receded into the background.
	   Before leaving Moscow, Primakov held talks with Yeltsin at the
president's country residence outside of Moscow, Yeltsin's press
service said.
	   Yeltsin authorized him to tell EU officials about the
government's plan to cope with the latest economic crisis,
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Russia's economic crisis, coupled with major downturns in East
Asia and Latin America, has sent shock waves through Europe at a
time when EU governments have taken a major turn to the left.
	   During their summit last weekend in Poertschach, Austria, the
EU's 15 leaders pledged to coordinate economic policies to cope
with financial crises in Russia and elsewhere.
	   The Europeans, however, have made clear that Russia must stick
by its reform course if it is to expect international help to
overcome the crisis.

Storm Babs weakens further as death toll rises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Tropical storm Babs weakened further
Tuesday after leaving a trail of destruction in Southeast Asia and
killing at least 189 people in the Philippines.
	   At 5 p.m. (0900 GMT), Babs was 40 kilometers (25 miles)
northeast of Xiamen, a coastal city in southeast China's Fujian
province, the Central Weather Bureau said.
	   The storm continued to lose strength as it moved northeast at 15
kph (9 mph), it said.
	   Babs caused massive damage in the Philippines, where it landed
as a powerful typhoon Thursday, and 53 people were still
unaccounted for.
	   In Manila, Emilia Tadeo, an official at the Office of Civil
Defense, said most of the newly discovered bodies were found in
landslides in Catanduanes Island in Bicol.
	   ``Rescue workers are still finding bodies in Catanduanes,'' she
said.
	   Tadeo said entire families died in the typhoon and their deaths
were never reported. Only the smell of decaying bodies is leading
rescuers to find them, she said.
	   The storm killed three people in Taiwan, where its outer fringes
brought four days of torrential rains, triggering massive
landslides and flooding.
	   A couple was killed Monday night when their house was buried by
a landslide, and a man was killed when he was blown to the ground
while repairing the roof of his house.
	   Farm damage in Taiwan is estimated at 140 million Taiwan dollars
(dlrs 4.2 million), officials said.
	   In the Philippines, officials said the storm damaged 3.1 billion
pesos (dlrs 73.3 million) worth of crops and property.
	   The storm also lashed Hong Kong with strong winds Sunday, but
caused little damage.

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ A Palestinian militant leader narrowly
escaped death Tuesday when he pulled his family away from his
booby-trapped car seconds before it exploded, witnesses said.
	   The car bombing wounded Mahmoud Majzoub, his wife Mona, their
4-year-old son and a man believed to be a Syrian passer-by,
security officials said.
	   They were admitted to a hospital with burns and wounds from bits
of the blasted car. Hospital officials said all four were in stable
condition.
	   The 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) blast also shattered shop windows and
damaged cars on a main road in east Sidon, 45 kilometers (27 miles)
south of Beirut.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. A local
spokesman for Islamic Jihad, the group to which Majzoub belongs,
blamed Israel.
	   Witnesses told The Associated Press that Majzoub, 31, noticed
something was wrong as he was about to start his car, which was
parked outside his house. He told his wife and child to get out and
ran for cover.
	   They were only meters (yards) away when the Volvo sedan
exploded, witnesses said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Explosives experts at the scene estimated the bomb contained 1.5
kilograms (3.3 pounds) of TNT high explosive.
	   Majzoub is a senior member of Jihad in Sidon. He was born in the
city but, like some Lebanese, joined the Palestinian group which is
staunchly opposed to peace with Israel.
	   The group held a rally Sunday in Ein El-Hilweh, the large
Palestinian refugee camp outside Sidon, to mark the third
anniversary of the assassination of its leader, Fathi Shekaki.
Shekaki was gunned down outside a hotel in Malta in 1985 in a hit
widely blamed on Israeli agents.

Saudi man's hand cut off for stealing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi authorities chopped off the
right hand of a man Tuesday for stealing at Islam's holiest site in
Mecca, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
	   Saeed bin Musalam al-Harthy was convicted of pickpocketing
worshipers praying in the Grand Mosque next to the Kabaa, the focal
point of Muslim prayers.
	   Al-Harthy's hand was cut off with a sword in the holy city of
Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, the agency said.
	   Last month, an Afghan man had his right hand cut off for
pickpocketing in the same mosque.
	   This was the fourth amputation this year. Earlier this month, an
Egyptian and a Saudi had their right hands amputated after they
were found guilty of stealing.
	   Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islamic law calls for
cutting off the right hand of thieves. Murderers, rapists, drug
traffickers and armed robbers are beheaded.
	   Executions and amputations are carried out with a sword in a
public square.
	   So far this year, Saudi Arabia has beheaded 22 people. Last year
124 people were executed.

Emirates cautious on outcome of Palestinian-Israeli accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The United Arab Emirates is
skeptical as to whether the agreement recently reached by the
Palestinians and Israel will achieve its objectives, the Gulf News
reported Tuesday.
	   ``Words and accords are something and implementation is
something else,'' the newspaper quoted Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid
al-Maktoum, the defense minister, as saying.
	   The accord, which was signed on Friday after marathon
U.S.-mediated negotiations, calls on the Palestinians to crack down
on militants to prevent attacks on Israelis in exchange for
additional Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank.
	   Mohammed said the Emirates would support the accord since the
Palestinians agreed to it.
	   ``As long as the Palestinians are satisfied with the outcome ...
we will support them and wish that they enjoy the peace and freedom
they strive for,'' the English-language paper quoted Mohammed as
saying.
	   Many in the Arab world have criticized the pact as geared too
much toward Israel's security demands and too little toward
Palestinian interests.
	   They have also questioned whether Israel will fully implement
the agreement.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ LPGA rookie sensation Se Ri Pak
returned home to a heroine's welcome Tuesday, a year after leaving
almost unnoticed for the U.S. golf tour.
	   Wearing sunglasses and holding a big teddy bear, the 20-year-old
winner of four LPGA tournaments was mobbed by 400 fans and
reporters when she arrived at Seoul's Kimpo Airport for a weeklong
visit.
	   ``I am satisfied with my debut year. I really thank fans at home
for their enthusiastic support,'' Pak said with a broad smile
during a news conference at the airport, which was cut short after
10 minutes because of the crowd.
	   Pak was accompanied by an entourage of 30, including LPGA
officials, golf writers and her American caddy, Jeff ``Tree''
Cable.
	   News media and political leaders spread the red carpet for her.
Pictures of her arrival appeared on the front pages of almost all
major local newspapers. Her activities were a major TV news item.
	   President Kim Dae-jung said he will award Pak the Order of Sport
Merit Maengho (Brave Tiger) Medal next Monday. It is the second
highest honor the government can confer to an athlete.
	   ``By winning four LPGA tournaments at a time that the nation was
suffering difficult times, Pak encouraged the Korean people to have
confidence that they can overcome the crisis,'' Prime Minister Kim
Jong-pil, an avid golf fan, said at a dinner he gave for Pak.
	   Pak's meteoric rise in the LPGA was the best news South Korea
has had in a year of deep economic trouble.
	   After winning the LPGA Championship in May, she won the U.S.
Women's Open a month later, broke the LPGA scoring record with a 61
in winning the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic and then rallied to beat
Dottie Pepper down the stretch at the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic two
weeks later.
	   Hers was the best rookie season since Nancy Lopez won nine
events in 1978.
	   Having already played 27 LPGA tournaments so far this year, Pak
said she badly needed a rest before heading for the season's last
two events _ the Japanese Classic and the LPGA Tour Championship.
	   In those tournaments, Pak will try to cut into her 40-point
deficit with Anika Sorenstam for LPGA Player of the Year.
	   ``While I am here, I want to take a rest no matter what. Going
shopping and gossiping with friends, that's what I want the most,''
Pak said.
	   But free time was a luxury Pak could hardly afford. Her schedule
in South Korea was packed with interviews, TV appearances,
meet-the-fans events staged by sponsor Samsung, and welcome-home
ceremonies in two provincial cities where she grew up.
	   Besides playing in a non-tour event in her honor this week, Pak
was to make a four-hour appearance as a guest of honor for the ``Se
Ri Cup'' junior golf tournament Wednesday.

New drama in Berlin's subway _ movies
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Subway riders in Berlin don't have to take the
train to the movies anymore. The movies have come to the subway.
	   Instead of images running through a projector while the audience
stays put, here the pictures are projected individually onto the
wall in a dark tunnel between two stations. To people on a train
zipping along at 40 kph (25 mph), it looks like they're moving.
	   ``I think it's funny,'' 18-year-old Magdelena Paar said after
seeing ``Metro Cinevision'' for the first time Monday. ``It
probably cost a lot, but it's a good idea.''
	   The idea belongs to Berlin filmmaker and tinkerer Joerg
Moser-Metius, who first tried to build a subway cinema system in
the 1980s, but couldn't get it to work.
	   Fifteen years and 4.5 million marks (dlrs 2.8 million) later, he
succeeded. The world premiere was held last weekend between the
Hansaplatz and Zoo stations on the northbound U9 line.
	   A prize-winning claymation film, ``The Frantic Ride,'' played
for 1,000 invited guests, including seven relatives of the late
filmmaker Charlie Chaplin, to whom Moser-Metius has dedicated his
invention.
	   But don't expect a great movie-going experience.
	   The film only lasts 30 seconds. Lights in the subway car itself
make the images _ not much bigger than a breadbox _ hard to see.
The screen is only on one side of the tunnel. Forget about sound _
no speakers.
	   And although a new computer is supposed to time the 900
projectors to the speed of the train, the resulting image is still
pretty jerky.
	   Moser-Metius blames a minor software error that causes the
frames to appear to slip sideways and out of synch, a problem he
says can be fixed.
	   ``We know that we can do it better,'' he said. ``Film technology
didn't enter the world 100 years ago with one toss either.''
	   Moser-Metius plans to change the films every two months; 18
shorts are on his program, including films by U.S. animator Bill
Plympton and even a couple from Chaplin himself.
	   Eventually, he hopes to begin selling advertising on the system
as well.
	   He also wants to sell his system to other subways. A contract
will be signed with the Paris Metro system ``in the coming weeks,''
he said, and London's Underground has expressed interest as well.
	   Not many passengers seemed to, though, during a few trips on the
line Monday.
	   Those with reading material kept their noses buried. Most stared
into space, unaware of the drama playing out on the other side of
the glass.
	   But those who really paid attention seemed impressed. Demet
Siemund thinks the system could help her to get her 3-year-old
daughter Alia to behave on the subway _ at least for a while.
	   ``This would be a great diversion for her,'' she says. ``Of
course, it's too short. It needs to last longer. But then people
would be staring out the window all the time and miss their stop.''

Philippine president urges Hong Kong employers not to cut Filipino
</HEADLINE>
workers' wages &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada urged Hong
Kong employers Tuesday not to cut the salaries of Filipino
housemaids earning the minimum wage, saying it would demoralize and
make life harder for the workers.
	   Hong Kong officials have proposed cutting the workers' wages by
up to 20 percent because of economic difficulties besetting the
Chinese territory. Many companies also have announced layoffs and
salary cuts.
	   Estrada said he was deeply concerned about the planned wage
cuts.
	   ``It will greatly affect the families in the Philippines of our
overseas Filipino workers,'' Estrada said in a statement. ``It will
likewise dampen the morale of our workers, which could adversely
affect their work performance.''
	   Although he acknowledged Hong Kong's economic difficulties,
Estrada said he was optimistic the Chinese territory would soon
``ride out the storm'' and recover from financial problems faster
than most other Asian countries.
	   Estrada specifically cited the Filipino housemaids' contribution
to Hong Kong's progress, saying they allow many Hong Kong women to
work and generate additional income.
	   ``Given Hong Kong's track record of upholding and protecting
human rights ... I am fully confident that the government and
people of Hong Kong will not allow the wage cut for the lowest-paid
earners in Hong Kong,'' Estrada said.
	   Hong Kong has about 170,000 imported domestic workers, more than
80 percent of whom are Filipinos.

Schroeder takes office as German chancellor

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat who
defeated Chancellor Helmut Kohl in elections last month on promises
to modernize Germany after 16 years of conservative rule, was
confirmed as Germany's seventh postwar chancellor Tuesday.
	   Though the vote was expected, Schroeder clearly savored the
moment, smiling slowly then standing to embrace Social Democratic
party leader Oskar Lafontaine as the new parliament's president
announced the results: 351 in favor, 287 against with 27
abstentions.
	   Schroeder acknowledged the vote, stating simply, ``I accept the
election.''
	   Schroeder, 54, will lead Germany into the 21st century and
through some critical changes, including the government's move to
Berlin and the adoption of the single European currency to replace
the German mark. He was to be sworn in later Tuesday.
	   Parliament president Wolfgang Thierse wished Schroeder
``strength and much success for our country.''
	   Kohl, who was relieved of office Monday, waited until after the
vote was confirmed to shake Schroeder's hand, showing no emotion as
he turned away. Other members of Kohl's Cabinet followed his lead.
	   The parliament later was to confirm Schroeder's Cabinet
ministers, and he was to convene the first Cabinet meeting by
evening.
	   Schroeder and his Social Democrats have sealed an alliance with
the environmentalist Greens party that pledges to put Germans back
to work, make it easier for foreign residents to get citizenship
and move toward shutting down nuclear power plants.
	   Schroeder's business-friendly reputation helped him win ``New
Center'' voters who previously mistrusted the left. But since his
triumph in the Sept. 27 election, he has stressed plans to
strengthen the social welfare state.
	   Schroeder has promised a ``new beginning'' after Kohl, Germany's
longest-serving chancellor this century, whose Christian Democrats
suffered a crushing defeat after 16 years in power.
	   Parliament has been rejuvenated: About a quarter of the 669
lawmakers are new and a record number _ 207 _ are women. Carsten
Schneider, a 22-year-old Social Democrat, is parliament's youngest
member ever.
	   Schroeder's government enjoys a 21-seat majority in the lower
house.
	   Schroeder represents a new generation of politicians with little
personal memory of World War II that feels at ease moving the seat
of power back to Berlin _ despite the city's burden of association
with Nazi Germany and the Prussian military state.

More Japanese question Prime Minister's leadership: poll
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ More than half of Japanese voters do not support
the government, with a majority of them citing doubts about Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi's leadership, according to a newspaper poll
published Tuesday.
	   A total of 52 percent of the respondents to a survey by the
Mainichi Shimbun said they do not support Obuchi's Cabinet, up from
39 percent in a similar survey in September.
	   Asked the reasons for their disapproval, 58 percent of the
respondents said they had ``no expectations regarding Obuchi's
leadership.''
	   Questioning 1,089 eligible voters picked at random across the
nation, the Mainichi conducted the survey by telephone the weekend
after Obuchi's government passed a package of laws designed to
revive the debt-ridden financial sector. No margin of error was
given.
	   Under the new laws, passed earlier this month, the government
created a 60 trillion yen (dlrs 508 billion) fund to clean up bad
loans in the banking sector.
	   Resolving the banking crisis is seen as a key step to pulling
Japan out of its deepest recession in decades.
	   A recent but separate nationwide poll by another major
newspaper, the Asahi, showed that 60.2 percent of respondents
disapproved of Obuchi's Cabinet.

Searching for cash, Russia expects record oil exports this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with record oil exports predicted, lower-than-expected
revenue from privatization. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia expects record exports this year of crude
oil, its top foreign-currency earner, despite pledges to cut sales
to help stop the slide in world prices, an official said Tuesday.
	   The reason for pushing exports ``is clear _ the lack of any
other sources of cash,'' said Energy Minister Sergei Generalov.
	   Russia last year experienced its first economic growth since the
Soviet collapse, but hopes for more of the same were dashed when a
new economic crisis erupted in mid-August. The government's chronic
cash-flow problems have grown even worse.
	   Generalov said Russia exported ``substantially more crude oil
than ever before'' in the first half of 1998.
	   Exports for the second half will be slightly lower, but overall,
``this year will in fact be a record high'' of about 115 million
tons, he told a news conference.
	   However, because world oil prices are quite low at present _
around dlrs 14 a barrel _ the government is unlikely to see a large
increase in revenues.
	   Russia promised the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries earlier this year that it would cut oil exports, because
surplus oil on world markets has kept prices low.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the chairman of a state-controlled bank
involved with debts said Russia will be able to make all payments
on its foreign debt this year.
	   Russia will have to pay about dlrs 3 billion toward its foreign
debt this year and about dlrs 18 billion next year, said Andrei
Kostin, chairman of the Vneshekonombank, or Bank of Foreign
Economic Activity.
	   The head of the Russian parliament's budget committee, Alexander
Zhukov, said Monday the government will owe dlrs 17.5 billion in
foreign debt in 1999, but won't have the revenues to pay it.
	   ``If the government decides it cannot make foreign debt payments
next year, it should say so in advance,'' Kostin said, according to
the Interfax news agency. ``There is no question of nonpayments at
present.''
	   Russia is trying to restructure its domestic debt, payments on
which were frozen when the financial crisis erupted in mid-August.
	   International lenders and debtors have been concerned about the
lack of a plan to boost revenues and slash spending, six weeks
after Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov took office.
	   The International Monetary Fund has said it wants to see a sound
economic plan implemented before releasing more of a dlrs 22.6
billion bailout package negotiated during the summer.
	   Meanwhile, the Federal Treasury said that privatizations netted
the government only 11 percent of the revenue it expected between
January and September _ 1.4 billion rubles (dlrs 79 million)
instead of 11.9 billion rubles (dlrs 698 million).
	   A number of big auctions have been canceled because of the
economic crisis.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO ambassadors analyzed reports of a
Serb military redeployment in Kosovo Tuesday before a key meeting
to decide whether to lift or extend the threat of airstrikes
against Serb forces.
	   Reports from Kosovo suggested President Slobodan Milosevic had
made a significant pullback of his military and police forces in
the province to meet international demands and avert NATO
intervention.
	   NATO had given Milosevic until 1900 GMT Tuesday to cut his
forces in Kosovo to levels in place before the conflict that flared
between the Serb military and ethnic Albanian separatists in
February.
	   The top-policy making body of the 16-nation alliance, the North
Atlantic Council, was to meet three hours ahead of that deadline to
decide what to do next.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a BBC interview
that NATO should not yet drop its guard despite ``serious
progress'' made by Milosevic toward meeting international demands.
``He still has some way to go and it may well be wise for us to
keep that threat hanging over him,'' Cook said.
	   Alliance officials said signs of increased compliance made
airstrikes very unlikely but added it was too early to judge if the
Serb troop withdrawal was sufficient for the airstrike threat to be
lifted.
	   Instead, the council was expected to set a new deadline for
complete compliance, or extend indefinitely the ``activation
order'' which is keeping some 400 allied warplanes on alert for
possible raids against the Serbs.
	   The ambassadors were studying reports from international
observers on the ground in Kosovo and NATO military, who are
operating unarmed observer flights over the province as part of the
Oct. 12 agreement between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   Convoys of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks carrying
Yugoslav troops and police were reported pulling out of several
parts of Kosovo Monday and Tuesday morning.
	   But NATO sources said the ambassadors would likely wait until
shortly before the deadline to declare whether Milosevic met the
conditions.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Police dispersed about 100 members of a jobless
support group who briefly occupied the tracks of the Eurostar train
to London on Tuesday in their campaign for free public transport
for the unemployed.
	   The demonstrators from the group Act Together Against
Unemployment occupied the Eurostar tracks at the Gare du Nord for
about a half-hour. Police then moved in, dispersing the group
without incident.
	   The demonstrators also were pressing for authorities to drop
charges pending against unemployed workers who failed to pay fines.
	   The French unemployment rate stands unmoved at 11.8 percent
after dropping from 12 percent.

Singapore newspaper to Malaysia: `Show proof or shut up'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's largest government-controlled
newspaper told Malaysian politicians Tuesday to ``shut up'' and
accused them of going on flights of fancy in alleging that
Singaporean aircraft have violated Malaysian airspace during the
past month.
	   ``The message that ought to get through to Kuala Lumpur is this:
Show proof of the ... intrusions or shut up,'' said the editorial
in The Straits Times.
	   It is unlikely in Singapore that such comments would be printed
without prior government approval in an editorial that repeatedly
quotes the Defense Ministry.
	   ``Hopefully, this matter will not get out of hand and get overly
politicized,'' The Straits Times said. It raised the issues of
``Malaysia's approach to regional security and its reliability as a
partner.''
	   It said claims about Singaporean air force intrusions into
Malaysian airspace ``pop up every so often because it has become a
habit for Malaysian politicians to blame Singapore whenever they
want to go on a flight of fancy.''
	   During a period of rapidly deteriorating relations, exacerbated
by the tension of economic crisis, the two neighbors have been
arguing for months through official statements and articles in the
government-controlled press of both countries. The disputes have
ranged from the location of a border post to the accuracy of the
memoirs of Singapore's most powerful man. Malaysia and Singapore
were once joined in the Malayan Federation.
	   On Sept. 18, Malaysia revoked a longstanding agreement that had
allowed Singapore military planes to enter its airspace without
specific prior approval for transit or search and rescue
operations. Singapore said it would abide by the decision. Almost
immediately, Malaysia began accusing Singapore of violations.
	   A week ago, Malaysia sent a note outlining six alleged incidents
of intrusion.
	   The Singapore Defense Ministry said it had investigated and
``found the claims to be without basis.''
	   The Straits Times editorial said that should have been enough.
	   But Malaysia's defense minister, Syed Hamid Albar, was quoted as
saying Saturday, ``We have made our statement and we stay by what
we said.''
	   The stage is set for another round of accusatory statements.
	   Malaysia's state news agency, Bernama, reprinted The Straits
Times editorial Tuesday, making it available to news media for
further comment and response.

<TEXT>
	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces scrambled Tuesday
to meet a NATO deadline for pulling back in Kosovo, and hundreds of
people returned to their homes here for the first time in months
now that most of the soldiers have gone.
	   Private radio station B-92 quoted Serb sources as saying the
withdrawal was complete and that government forces in Kosovo were
back to the level before Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched his crackdown against ethnic Albanian militants Feb. 28.
	   International observers were out in force Tuesday in the
majority Albanian province to verify those claims. U.S. officials
in Washington say the Clinton administration wants verification
before declaring that Milosevic had satisfied the terms of the deal
he accepted to end the crisis.
	   ``We want to make sure the movements are a real withdrawal and
not a reconfiguration (of forces),'' said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
	   The 16-nation NATO alliance has threatened to launch airstrikes
unless Milosevic halts his crackdown and cuts his forces to levels
in place before the conflict began.
	   NATO ambassadors were to meet later Tuesday in Brussels,
Belgium, hours before the 1900 GMT deadline for Milosevic to
comply.
	   ``They're going down to the wire,'' said Shaun Byrnes, head of
the American section of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission,
which has been monitoring the situation since July. ``It's been the
pattern.''
	   In this former rebel stronghold 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina, hundreds of ethnic Albanians swarmed the
streets, visiting homes and shops they abandoned when Serb forces
overran the town July 28.
	   As if to underscore the uncertainty of the situation, the crowds
disappeared again after a few bursts of automatic gunfire rang out
as a military convoy was rolling through the town toward Pristina.
	   Serb police said the shots came from somewhere in the village
but they did not return the fire. About three kilometers (1.5
miles) north of the town, a few Kosovo Liberation Army rebels
wandered up the road but fled in terror as they heard the Serbs
approach.
	   In Malisevo, one of the townspeople, Osman Mazreku, said he had
fled to a nearby village nearly three months ago with his wife,
mother and three children. His aged father chose to remain behind.
He was arrested by police and has not been seen since, Osman said.
	   ``He said `I'm old and they won't do anything to me,''' Osman
said. ``I was afraid something like this would happen but he was
determined'' to stay.
	   The top floor of Osman's two-story house had been gutted by
flames. Clothing, valuables and garbage were strewn across the
ground floor.
	   ``I'm sorry to see my house in this condition, but I'm happy to
be alive,'' Osman said. ````That's all that matters. I hope they'll
let me live here.''
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and
most want independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 have been driven from
their homes in seven months of fighting since Milosevic launched
the crackdown.
	   As the withdrawal accelerated, Kosovo's Serb governor, Veljko
Odalovic, thanked the police for ``bringing peace to Kosovo'' and
pledged the province will be defended from ethnic Albanian
``terrorists'' with or without the police.
	   On Monday, tanks withdrew from roadside positions in the central
Drenica area where they had dug in since Oct. 18. At another
checkpoint, in Dragobilje, which was occupied by heavily armed Serb
police a few days earlier, a uniformed ethnic Albanian guerrilla
stood holding an automatic rifle.
	   A NATO source in Brussels, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the alliance's ambassadors probably would wait until shortly
before the deadline to declare whether Milosevic met the
conditions.
	   The deadline has already been extended once since Milosevic
agreed to the peace plan.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin checked into a sanitarium Tuesday, a
day after doctors ordered him to cancel yet another foreign trip
because of high blood pressure and extreme fatigue.
	   Yeltsin's announcement Monday that he would not make the one-day
trip to Austria fueled speculation about his ability to stay in
office and guide Russia through its worst economic crisis in the
post-Soviet era.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov went to Vienna in Yeltsin's
place to meet with European Union leaders and international
lenders.
	   Yeltsin's office said Monday the 67-year-old Russian leader was
suffering from an ``asthenic condition.'' Asthenia refers to a lack
of physical strength.
	   Yeltsin's blood pressure was also unstable and doctors
recommended a vacation, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said.
	   On Tuesday, Yeltsin checked into the Barvikha sanitarium near
Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Yakushkin.
Yeltsin has stayed there in the past, including when he was
recovering from multiple heart bypass surgery in 1996.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin would undergo ``a course of restoration
treatment,'' Interfax reported. The length of his stay depends on
the treatment scheduled, he said, without elaborating.
	   Speaking on Russian television Tuesday, Yakushkin said canceling
the trip was a difficult decision for Yeltsin, but he feared his
opponents would exploit any public signs of weakness.
	   ``He understands that this visit would be like a litmus test
watched by many politicians and, primarily, his foes,'' Yakushkin
said. ``He understands quite well that everyone would mostly watch
how he walks and talks, not the essence of the talks.''
	   ``I think that he was unwilling to take risks,'' Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin's recent ailments have heightened calls for his
resignation. If he were to step down _ though he insists he won't _
he would be replaced by Primakov, who would be required to call new
elections within three months.
	   Primakov has been prime minister for only six weeks and has yet
to produce his own blueprint to deal with the country's deep-rooted
economic problems. But he is widely respected by all political
factions and is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when
Yeltsin has receded into the background.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Tuesday that Yeltsin's
aides are ``mocking'' Russians by insisting he has no crippling
illness.
	   ``Mr. Yeltsin's inability to work has been obvious to us for
quite a long time,'' Zyuganov said at a news conference. He called
for Yeltsin to undergo an independent medical exam and for the
results to be made public.
	   Primakov held talks with Yeltsin at the president's Gorky-9
country residence outside of Moscow before leaving for Vienna.
Russian television later broadcast poor quality pictures of Yeltsin
sitting in a chair behind a small table and talking to Primakov.
	   Yeltsin, wearing a blue sweater, did not look ill. He nodded in
response to Primakov's comments, but their words were not
broadcast.
	   For several months now, Yeltsin has rarely put in full days at
the Kremlin, spending most of his time at his country residences.
	   Yeltsin has been weakened by recurring health problems, But the
president and his doctors insist that he'll serve out the rest of
his term, set to end in the summer of 2000, and deny he has
crippling health problems.
	   Still, Yeltsin clearly lacks the energy he displayed in his
early years in office. Potential candidates in the 2000
presidential race have already begun an informal campaign to
replace him.
	   Yeltsin was forced to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier
this month because of a respiratory infection. He has already
canceled a visit to Malaysia that was planned for next month, but a
visit to India in December was still on his schedule.
	   Yakushkin also said that Yeltsin is still scheduled to meet with
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin in Moscow next month, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

Russia to grant amnesty to prisoners suffering from tuberculosis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian authorities plan to grant amnesty to some
inmates suffering from tuberculosis to better combat the disease
that is rampant in the country's prisons, a news agency reported
Tuesday.
	   Prisoners with tuberculosis who are serving prison sentences up
to two years will be released, Justice Minister Pavel
Krasheninnikov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Krasheninnikov said if some of the 90,000 prisoners with TB in
Russia's prisons are released, it will be easier to combat the
disease, which has spread quickly in the overcrowded prisons where
conditions are abysmal and diseases of all sorts are rife.
	   Krasheninnikov has said the government can afford to spend only
67 kopeks (about 4 cents) a day to feed each of its more than 1
million prisoners. Russia has one of the highest incarceration
rates in the world.

Who's running Germany? Most people say Lafontaine, not Schroeder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder was being sworn-in as chancellor
Tuesday, yet most Germans think he won't have the final say in
running the country, according to a new poll.
	   About 43 percent of 1,003 Germans questioned said they believe
Social Democrat party leader Oskar Lafontaine, who also is the
designated finance minister, will be making decisions with
Schroeder.
	   Thirty-seven percent said they think Schroeder alone is in
charge, and 13 percent said they were uncertain.
	   The Forsa poll, published in the Neue Bildpost newspaper, did
not give a margin of error but polls of this size usually have a
margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percent.
	   Schroeder repeatedly has denied reports of clashes with the
powerful party chief, whose traditional leftist stance sometimes
rubs against the new chancellor's efforts to push the party toward
the middle.
	   ``I have the responsibility for setting the government's
direction and intend to do so,'' Schroeder said in a German TV
interview last week. ``Oskar Lafontaine knows that.''
	   Lafontaine, too, has dismissed reports that he is calling the
shots, although his tight control over the party helped Schroeder
unseat Chancellor Helmut Kohl after 16 years of conservative rule.
	   ``He (Schroeder) runs the government from start to finish, and
no one _ including the party chief _ wants to challenge his
authority,'' Lafontaine said Sunday.
	   Still, the party chief has been seen as exercising broad
influence over the new government's shape. Finance minister is one
of Germany's most important cabinet posts, and Lafontaine won new
powers over European affairs for his ministry by poaching them from
Economics.
	   Lafontaine also forced a political rival out as parliamentary
faction leader and squeezed Schroeder's choice for the economics
ministry _ an outside free-marketeer unpopular with the party's
old-style leftist wing _ into turning down the job.

Russia asks NATO to revoke plans for strikes against Serbia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia asked NATO on Tuesday to revoke its threat
of airstrikes against Yugoslavia, saying that deployment of
international observers to Kosovo province means a peaceful
settlement there is possible.
	   ``There is no alternative to a non-violent settlement of the
Kosovo problem,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   A United Nations resolution ``gives the green light to launching
an OSCE mission, therefore continuing the process of a peaceful,
political settlement,'' said the statement quoted by the Interfax
news agency.
	   Observers under the command of the 54-country Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe are to see whether Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic is complying with a NATO demand to
pull back his forces before a 1900 GMT deadline Tuesday.
	   Milosevic has made a significant last-minute pullback of his
military and police forces from Kosovo, whose mainly ethnic
Albanian population wants independence.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry also praised Moscow's role in averting
airstrikes so far. Russia adamantly opposes the use of force
against Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, with which it
shares Slavic and Orthodox religious roots.
	   ``Russia has maintained a firm and resolute position,'' the
statement said. ``The most important thing has been accomplished:
All clauses directly or indirectly sanctioning automatic use of
force in spite of the priorities of the Security Council, bypassing
the U.N. Charter, have been scrapped.''
	   The deputy speaker of the lower house of parliament, Sergei
Baburin, also hailed the developments as Russia's ``return to big
politics,'' Interfax reported.
	   The world ``forgot the Russia that says `No,' and the memory has
to be refreshed,'' Baburin said.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ At least 420,000 Ugandans who have been
dislodged from their homes by civil strife are being cared for by
relief agencies, an international aid group said Tuesday.
	   The Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross said
it was providing them with medical care, as well as seeds and tools
for planting.
	   The displaced people are mostly from the country's northern and
western regions where rebels are struggling to unseat the
government in Kampala, the Red Cross said.
	   The U.N. World Food Program in Kampala said at least 300,000
Ugandans from northern districts had fled attacks by the rebel
Lord's Resistance Army, which has fought a 12-year battle to unseat
President Yoweri Museveni.
	   The food program report also said more than 100,000 peasants had
fled their homes in two years of fighting by the rebel Allied
Democratic Forces, largely based in eastern Congo.
	   The Red Cross put the total number of displaced at 420,000.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A U.N. agency has begun distributing food
to more than 25,000 rural Rwandan families facing food shortages in
the southwest of the country.
	   The U.N World Food Program said Monday in the next three weeks
it will distribute about 1,200 tons of maize and beans in all 13 of
Gikongoro's communes, providing assistance to more than 20 percent
of the region's 500,000 residents.
	   The agency said families are living in such poor terrain they
can no longer grow enough food to sustain themselves.
	   ``Most of these families have only 5-square-meter
(50-square-foot) plots of land to cultivate,'' said Gerard Van
Dijk, the food program's representative in Rwanda.
	   ``They're trying to grow their crops on meager crops on steep
hillsides areas where the quality of the soil has eroded over the
years. This makes it virtually impossible for them to harvest
enough food to carry them to the next season,'' he said.
	   The distribution was timed to coincide with the start of the
planting season in December.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A judge denied bail Tuesday to
four men charged with killing a pregnant rhino cow and her calf on
a game farm outside Thabazimbi in the Northern Province earlier
this month appeared.
	   Police Sgt. Deon Hoffman said Ezekiel Mmebe, 25, his brother
Simon Mmebe, 23, Shedreck Molefe, 22, and Moses Ketshegile, 53,
were ordered to stay in jail by the Thabazimbi Magistrate's Court.
	   Their trial was postponed to Nov. 10.
	   They were arrested last Wednesday after a rhino cow and her
female calf were shot on a nearby farm two days earlier.
	   Both horns of the cow were removed, as well as the front horn of
the calf.
	   Police also recovered seven stolen firearms -- two pistols, an
assault rifle, a hunting rifle, a Remington Magnum rifle, a shotgun
and a .22 rifle.
	   The four are charged with hunting protected wildlife,
housebreaking and theft.
	   Hoffman said they allegedly broke into several farm houses in
the district in recent months and stole firearms used to kill
rhinos.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A strike by thousands of municipal
workers protesting delays in receiving their pay ended Tuesday and
the workers began clearing up garbage they dumped outside city
council offices in downtown Harare.
	   Giles Kuimba, spokesman for the city council, said all the
strikers received their pay by Tuesday and were returning to their
stations.
	   The strikers stopped work Friday and staged violent
demonstrations outside Mayor Solomon Tawengwa's office for three
days.
	   They overturned or torched several city-owned vehicles,
vandalized water hydrants and smashed windows at municipal offices.
	   Workers said banks refused to honor their pay checks Friday,
saying the council had not deposited enough funds to meet them.
	   In one protest, strikers tore down and burned the national flag.
It was the first time the flag was destroyed by demonstrators since
independence in 1980 and reflected growing discontent over
worsening economic woes and the management of city untilities by
Tawengwa, appointed mayor by President Robert Mugabe's ruling
party.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ More government troops have been arriving
in the southern delta town of Warri where rival ethnic groups have
been embroiled in bitter clashes, the state news agency reported.
	   Planeloads of troops have been airlifted to coastal villages in
and near Warri, the report said, without specifying the number.
	   The troops come to bolster 200 soldiers and anti-riot police
already dispatched to Warri last Thursday when fighting between
ethnic Ijaws and Itsekiris erupted.
	   At least six people were killed and dozens of houses razed to
the ground in the renewed fighting, police reports said.
	   The Ijaws and the Itsekiris have been fighting since March last
year over the government's relocation of a local government office
from an Ijaw area to an Itsekiri part of town.
	   Warri is 300 kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Lagos.
	   --
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Thousands of ethnic Krahn Liberians
have fled to neighboring Ivory Coast in the wake of a bloody
shooting incident last month between a former rebel leader and
government troops, the United Nations refugee agency has reported.
	   A U.N. mission which visited the Ivorian districts of Danane,
Guiglo and Toulepleu last week to investigate found at least 4,000
Liberians had recently arrived, the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees said Monday.
	   Most of the refugees cited harassment or the fear of persecution
for leaving Liberia. They said they were targeted because of their
ethnic ties to former warlord Roosevelt Johnson, a Krahn.
	   The refugees are staying with local villagers, but would be soon
moved to a more permanent site, the statement said.
	   Poor roads prevented investigators from visiting other sites,
leading them to believe the figure could be higher.
	   Liberian forces last month opened fire on Johnson as he tried to
take refuge in the U.S. Embassy to escape government forces seeking
to arrest him. The battle killed at least three of Johnson's aides
and wounded two Americans.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with
prices falling in Tokyo for a third consecutive session, but
surging in Singapore on expectations of further interest rate cuts.
Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average moved in and out
of negative territory before finally closing down 22.78 points, or
0.16 percent, at 13,820.68. The market rose in early trading after
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi instructed his Cabinet to compile a
package of economic stimulus measures, but the gain proved
short-lived amid uncertainty about the plan. Meanwhile, the U.S.
dollar was quoted at 119.36 yen in late afternoon, up 0.34 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo. Singapore shares closed sharply higher, with
the key index surging 40.10 points, or 3.6 percent, to 1,153.60.
Expectations of at least another half-point cut in local interest
rates by the end of the year fueled the frenzied buying on the
bourse, dealers said. South Korean shares slumped 3.5 percent in
reaction to the rise of the dollar against the Japanese currency,
which means South Korean exporters lose price advantage against
their Japanese rivals. The Korean Composite stock Price Index fell
12.89 points to 360.43. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ In place of ailing Boris Yeltsin,
Russia's prime minister flew Tuesday to Austria to brief the
European Union on economic recovery plans and seek help in coping
with Moscow's worst economic crisis of the post-Soviet era. Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov made the one-day trip at the head of a
Russian delegation after doctors ordered the Russian president to
stay home. Yeltsin checked into a sanatorium Tuesday for an
unspecified ``course of restoration treatment,'' the Interfax news
agency reported. Following official welcoming ceremonies with
Austrian President Thomas Klestil, Primakov was to meet Prime
Minister Viktor Klima; the head of the European Commission Jacques
Santer and EU Commissioner Hans van den Broek. Klima and the others
will be seeking not only assurances that Russia has a viable plan
for economic recovery but will also try to gauge the impact of
Yeltsin's health problems on Russia's overall stability.
(EU-RUSSIA)
	   SHENZHEN, China (AP) _ Gripes about corrupt officials are common
in China. But a daring author has taken the complaints a step
beyond, blaming the political system that lets sleazy bureaucrats
get rich at the expense of ordinary people. He Qinglian's book
punctures government propaganda built up during China's celebration
of the 20th anniversary of economic reforms that moved the
communist nation toward a market economy and urged Chinese to
become wealthy. Her book, ``The Pitfalls of Modernization,'' also
hits a nerve because a large population of people are still poor
and resent officials who profit from special privileges. ``Most got
rich through corruption, and not by producing anything,'' He said
in an interview. (FEA-CHINA-REFORMS ASTRAY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Fuji Bank Ltd. will cut 1,200 jobs over the
next three years and close offices in Japan and overseas as part of
a broad restructuring plan, a newspaper reported Tuesday. The bank,
one of Japan's largest, will cut the number of overseas branches by
half, and close about 50 branches at home, the mass-circulation
Yomiuri said. Fuji currently has 355 branches and 14,600 employees.
The job cuts will be made by March 2001. A spokesman for the bank
refused to comment on the report. The bank plans to increase its
capital by 200 billion yen (dlrs 1.7 billion) through contributions
from companies within its corporate group. Fuji is part of the Fuyo
group, which also includes companies such as Yasuda Trust and
Banking Co. Fuji also plans to ask for a capital infusion from the
government as part of Japan's plan to recapitalize its banking
system, the paper, Japan's largest, said. (JAPAN-FUJI BANK)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia expects record exports this year of crude
oil, its top foreign-currency earner, despite pledges to cut sales
to help stop the slide in world prices, an official said Tuesday.
The reason for pushing exports ``is clear _ the lack of any other
sources of cash,'' said Energy Minister Sergei Generalov. Russia
last year experienced its first economic growth since the Soviet
collapse, but hopes for more of the same were dashed when a new
economic crisis erupted in mid-August. Generalov said Russia
exported ``substantially more crude oil than ever before'' in the
first half of 1998. Exports for the second half will be slightly
lower, but overall, ``this year will in fact be a record high'' of
about 115 million tons, he said. However, because world oil prices
are quite low at present _ around dlrs 14 a barrel _ the government
is unlikely to see a large increase in revenues. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic, facing
a Tuesday deadline Tuesday, significantly pulled military and
police forces from Kosovo at the last minute to avert NATO
airstrikes. The private radio station B-92 quoted Serb sources as
saying Tuesday that government forces in the Serbian province were
back to the level before Milosevic launched his crackdown against
ethnic Albanian militants in February. International observers were
out in force Tuesday in the majority ethnic Albanian province to
verify those claims. U.S. officials in Washington say the U.S.
government wants verification before declaring that Milosevic had
satisfied the terms of the deal he accepted to end the crisis.
Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 have been driven from
their homes in the seven-month crackdown. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   KIRYAT ARBA, West Bank (AP) _ Rabbis leading a tearful funeral
procession for a Jewish settler killed by suspected Palestinian
militants demanded Tuesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
go back on his promise to withdraw from West Bank land. Monday's
killing in the West Bank town of Hebron tested the new
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, which includes a pledge by the
Palestinians to work harder to prevent attacks on Israel and rein
in militants. In a sign of change, Palestinian security forces
cooperated with their Israeli counterparts in trying to catch the
killers who fled into the Palestinian-run sector of divided Hebron.
In the northern West Bank, meanwhile, hundreds of Palestinians
clashed with Israeli troops on the outskirts of the Balata and
Askar refugee camps to protest Monday's killing of a Palestinian
man whose body was found outside a Jewish settlement.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ A Palestinian militant leader narrowly
escaped death Tuesday in southern Lebanon when he pulled his family
away from his booby-trapped car seconds before it exploded,
witnesses said. The car bombing wounded Mahmoud Majzoub and three
others, security officials said. There was no immediate claim of
responsibility. A local spokesman for Islamic Jihad, the group to
which Majzoub belongs, blamed Israel. Witnesses told The Associated
Press that Majzoub, 31, noticed something was wrong as he was about
to start his car, which was parked outside his house. He told his
wife and child to get out and ran for cover. They were only meters
(yards) away when the Volvo sedan exploded, witnesses said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. (LEBANON-EXPLOSION)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ One of China's most prominent democracy
activists, his associate and as many as 13 other dissidents were
reported detained or missing Tuesday in a police crackdown just
weeks after China signed a key human rights treaty. Police took
veteran campaigner Xu Wenli away from his Beijing home Tuesday
morning, blocking his plan to set off on a cross-country trip to
protest the harassment of another dissident, Xu's wife said. Police
also detained Xu's associate, Zhang Hui, and searched Xu's home for
two hours, confiscating a fax machine, papers, magazines and
photos, said Xu's wife, He Xintong. She said the detentions
demonstrated that authorities have no intention of relaxing their
grip despite China's Oct. 5 signing of a U.N. human rights treaty,
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. A Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said he was unaware of
the detentions. But he said China signed the U.N. pact on civil and
political rights to safeguard citizens' rights, and remained
determined to do so. (CHINA-DISSIDENT)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin checked into a sanitarium Tuesday, a
day after doctors ordered him to cancel yet another foreign trip
because of high blood pressure and extreme fatigue. Yeltsin's
announcement Monday that he would not make the one-day trip to
Austria fueled speculation about his ability to stay in office and
guide Russia through its worst economic crisis in the post-Soviet
era. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov went to Vienna in Yeltsin's
place to meet with European Union leaders and international
lenders. Yeltsin's office said Monday the 67-year-old Russian
leader was suffering from a lack of physical strength. Yeltsin's
blood pressure was also unstable and doctors recommended a
vacation, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.

2 Rwandan genocide suspects end hunger strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUKHDEV CHHATBAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Two of 25 Rwandan genocide suspects who
went on a hunger strike to protest what they called a United
Nations tribunal bias against them resumed eating 24 hours later, a
U.N. official said Tuesday.
	   Clement Kayishema and Obed Ruzindana, who are jointly charged
with killing of Tutsis in the Rwandan genocide of 1994, ate
breakfast, said the source on condition his name was not published.
	   Thirty genocide suspects and two convicts, who are appealing,
are detained by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in
the northern Tanzania town of Arusha.
	   ``I saw Kayishema taking some bites this morning at the ICTR
facility,'' said the source.
	   He said he had also been told by ICTR workers that Ruzindana had
breakfast.
	   A prison worker, who also spoke on condition his name was not
published, said some of the other detainees were ``secretly taking
biscuits and juices.''
	   The 25 suspects said Monday they were joining the hunger strike
of a convicted former mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu, who stopped eating
last week because the tribunal refused to pay for the Canadian
lawyer he wanted as a defense attorney.
	   The court gives suspects a choice of tribunal-appointed defense
attorneys free. Suspects may select non-tribunal attorneys but the
court will not pay for them.
	   In a letter Monday to the court the 25 suspects accused the
panel of bias, indifference to detainees' complaints and an
inability to ``understand defense arguments.''
	   Awe Okali, the tribunal's registrar, later defended the system
of court-appointed lawyers and said the detainees were panicking
because they realized the tribunal's work was moving forward.
	   ``The reality of the tribunal's work of calling to account
persons accused of genocide in Rwanda is hitting home,'' Okali
said. ``In these circumstances, these detainees feel they have
nothing to lose by engaging in these agitations.''
	   Akayesu is appealing the life sentence he received earlier this
month for his role in the genocide, which was orchestrated by the
Hutu-dominated government.
	   More than 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and politically moderate
Hutus, were killed between April and July 1994. The slaughter ended
when a Tutsi-dominated rebel force defeated the government army.

Teen-age girls on trial for murder of taxi driver
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The trial of two teen-age girls,
charged with premeditated murder of a taxi driver, opened Tuesday
in a Budapest municipal court.
	   Accompanied by guards, the two handcuffed 15-year-olds were
brought into the courtroom, both obviously under strain.
	   One of the girls, Diana Brasko, broke down crying when she was
seated, facing the judge.
	   The other, Andrea Bozzai, was chalk white, but determinedly
chewed her gum, in an effort to keep her composure.
	   After hearing the opening remarks, the judge decided to to try
the two separately, and Brasko was sent out of the courtroom. She
is to return to court later Tuesday.
	   Last November, the two lured a 29-year-old taxi driver, Janos
Gaspar, to the outskirts of the city with the promise of sex and
then killed him.
	   The girls admitted to picking a particular driver, nicknamed
``Mosquito'' for his slight build. They had planned to steal his
taxi, then sell it for cash.
	   ``We planned to knock out the driver and take his car,'' Bozzai
told the court Tuesday.
	   They took along a plastic soft-drink bottle filled with water
and once they lured him out of the car they knocked him out with
the bottle and kicked him to death.
	   ``Diana and the driver got out of the car and started kissing,''
she said. ``And then I started yelling at him to leave my
girlfriend alone.''
	   ``Then Diana also started yelling, saying to him `You stinking
(expletive deleted), who do you think you are, wanting to
(expletive deleted) two underage girls!''' Bozzai said.
	   Hours later, before dawn, a cruising police patrol noticed a
taxi with high beams on being driven erratically. They pulled the
taxi over and noticed blood stains on one of the girls' clothes.
	   On June 4, Bozzai and Brasko were formally charged with
premeditated murder committed with extreme cruelty, in a case that
was unprecedented in Hungary. They face a maximum sentence of 10-15
years in prison, if found guilty.
	   Child psychologists examined the girls and have found them to be
fit to stand trial. They said the girls have shown no remorse.

BSkyB still short of controlling stake in Man United
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB said Tuesday it has not yet
won control of the majority of shares in Manchester United, the
soccer club it hopes to purchase for 623 million pounds (dlrs 1
billion).
	   The satellite broadcasting company said it had received valid
acceptances from shareholders representing 33.5 percent of the
club's shares.
	   Combined with shares that BSkyB has been buying directly, the
broadcaster has a total ownership just under 45 percent.
	   For a takeover, the company has to have more than 50 percent to
gain a controlling stake in the club.
	   Shareholders have until next Tuesday to decide whether to accept
the offer, although BSkyB can extend the deadline until early
December if it chooses.
	   The government's Office of Fair Trading is expected to issue a
report into the monopoly implications of the deal next week.
	   If it recommends further investigation from the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, the offer would remain on hold while the
inquiry takes place.
	   The Financial Times reported Monday that Peter Mandelson, trade
and industry secretary, was facing growing pressure from fellow
cabinet members to refer the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.

Russia to launch U.S. satellite on Nov. 4
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's last commercial space launch of the year,
to put a U.S. communications satellite into orbit, has been moved
up one day to Nov. 4, the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The PanAmSat-3 satellite, made by Hughes Space and
Communications, will be sent into space aboard a Russian Proton-K
booster from the Baikonur cosmodrome in neighboring Kazakstan.
	   It will be Russia's fourth commercial launch of a foreign
satellite aboard a Proton this year, Interfax said, citing the
Khrunichev company that manufactures the Proton.

Lebed calls for restoration of vice president's post in Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new Chernomyrdin quotes in final 4 grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former national security adviser Alexander Lebed
called Tuesday for the restoration of the position of vice
president, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``If you have been unlucky with a wife once, that is no reason
to give up the institution of marriage,'' Lebed said.
	   The position of vice president was abolished when Russia revised
its constitution in 1993. The last vice president, Alexander
Rutskoi, led a rebellion against Yeltsin in the fall of that year
that failed and prompted the constitutional changes.
	   Lebed said the president should be in charge of foreign policy,
domestic affairs and security, the vice president in charge of the
regions and the prime minister the economy.
	   Lebed now is governor of the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, but
he is expected to run for president in the next elections in 2000.
He came third in the 1996 elections.
	   Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who has also
advocated recreating the vice president post, suggested Tuesday
that lawmakers simply amend the constitution and give the prime
minister the additional powers of vice president.
	   If the president were to leave office, the prime minister could
assume the post for the rest of the president's term instead of
having to call new elections three months later, as is now required
by law, Chernomyrdin said.
	   The possibility of new elections so soon creates a ``nervous
atmosphere,'' he said, according to Interfax.
	   Still, Chernomyrdin cautioned that such amendments should not be
made hastily, particularly when ``a crisis is raging in the
country.''

Iran to start major war games on Afghanistan border next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran said Tuesday it will stage major
military exercises on its border with Afghanistan early next week.
	   About 200,000 troops from the Iranian army, air force and navy
will take part in the war games, the commander of ground forces,
Brig. Gen. Abdolali Pourshasd, was quoted as saying by state-run
Tehran radio.
	   The maneuvers, code-named Zolfaqar, were set to start last month
but have been postponed several times. No reason was given.
	   The naval drills will take place on Lake Hamoon, which lies on
the border of Iran and Afghanistan.
	   Tension rose sharply between Iran and Afghanistan last month
after the Taliban militia, which controls most of Afghanistan,
admitted that its forces had killed eight Iranian diplomats and a
journalist in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   But the situation improved early this month after the
intervention of U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who shuttled
between Tehran and Kabul and secured the release of 26 Iranians
held captive in Afghanistan.
	   Brahimi also procured a promise from the Taliban to hold
face-to-face talks with Iran.

New Zealand foreign minister says Anwar issue will not affect APEC
</HEADLINE>
summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The dismissal and jailing of
Malaysia's former deputy prime minister will not pose major
problems for next month's summit in Kuala Lumpur of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, New Zealand's foreign
minister said Tuesday.
	   Foreign Minister Don McKinnon added, however, ``the issue is not
going to go away. It is in the process of judiciary at the
moment,'' the Malaysian news agency Bernama reported.
	   There have been fears of disruptions to the summit by
demonstrations by supporters of Anwar Ibrahim, who was dismissed
Sept. 2 and then led major protests against his former mentor,
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. He since has been charged with
sexual misconduct and corruption, accusations he says are false and
politically motivated.
	   Saturday night, riots erupted, with police firing tear gas and
water cannons at protesters inside a mosque. Some 270 people were
arrested.
	   Anwar's trial begins Nov. 2. The APEC summit is Nov. 17-18, with
leaders including U.S. President Bill Clinton scheduled to attend.
	   McKinnon said he had a lot of faith in the Malaysian judicial
process giving Anwar a fair trial.
	   He also said he had raised the issue Sunday in a meeting with
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, and told him New
Zealand wanted to see a transparent judicial process.
	   McKinnon said he and Abdullah also discussed trade, in which
Malaysia now sells more to New Zealand than it buys there, and
security issues.

Kosovo rebel representative calls Serb withdrawals `illusion'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The withdrawal of government forces from the
troubled Yugoslav province of Kosovo is an illusion created in a
late effort to avert NATO airstrikes, a political representative of
the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army said Tuesday.
	   Swiss-based representative Bardhyl Mahmuti accused Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic of ignoring his agreement with U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke to end turmoil in Kosovo.
	   He also continues to flout a U.N. resolution calling for the
withdrawal of special Serb police units from the province and
movement toward a negotiated settlement, Mahmuti claimed.
	   Mahmuti handed reporters a 70-page list of alleged violations of
the Sept. 23 resolution and the Holbrooke agreement.
	   As Government forces scrambled to meet a 1900 GMT NATO deadline
for pulling back in Kosovo, Mahmuti claimed that Milosevic is
merely accelerating a ``tactic of creating the illusion he is
really going to withdraw.''
	   ``For us, the date and the moment chosen to create this
impression of a withdrawal of Serb forces corresponds exactly to
the moment'' when NATO must decide whether to maintain the threat
of using force, he said.
	   Mahmuti said the rebels are still respecting their ceasefire,
declared earlier this month, and have complied with the U.N.
resolution.
	   Milosevic must withdraw all Serb forces from Kosovo and create
the conditions for some 300,000 people displaced by the fighting in
Kosovo to return home before the KLA would be prepared to
negotiate, he added.
	   But the KLA's insistence on full independence for the Yugoslav
province still stands. ``We can't live together (with Serbia),''
Mahmuti said. ``It's out of the question.''

Electronics makers Toshiba, Hitachi announce losses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS figure to dlrs 50 million, 1st graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese electronics giant Toshiba Corp. posted
losses of more than dlrs 50 million in the first half of fiscal
1998 _ the company's first dip into the red in nearly 50 years, the
company said Tuesday.
	   Hitachi Ltd., the country's largest electronics maker, also
announced losses for the half-year ended Sept. 30.
	   Toshiba posted a 6.4 billion yen (dlrs 53.6 million) parent
pretax loss for the latest six months, against a 25.4 billion yen
(dlrs 212 million) profit in the same period last year.
	   Toshiba also had a 6.4 billion yen (dlrs 53.6 million) parent
net loss for the half-year after posting a 22.45 billion yen (dlrs
188 million) profit the previous year.
	   Toshiba's parent sales were down 12.3 percent to 1.60 trillion
yen (dlrs 13.4 billion).
	   The company blamed its poor results on a drop in semiconductor
prices and slow demand for computers and consumer electronics. It
said the Asian financial crisis had cut into demand for memory
chips.
	   It was the first time the company had recorded pretax losses
since 1950, said company spokesman Kazuyoshi Ishiyama.
	   Hitachi recorded a parent pretax loss of 69.2 billion yen (dlrs
580 million) for the half-year compared to profits of 33.3 billion
yen (dlrs 279 million) a year earlier.
	   The company recorded a parent net loss of 124.7 billion yen
(dlrs 1.04 billion) for the latest six months against a profit of
24.3 billion yen (dlrs 204 million) a year earlier.
	   Hitachi's parent sales were down 12 percent to 1.80 trillion yen
(dlrs 15.1 billion) from 2.05 trillion yen (dlrs 17.2 billion) the
previous year.
	   The company said the losses resulted from Japan's recession and
slumping semiconductor and consumer electronics sales.
	   Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Japan's largest
comprehensive heavy machinery maker, announced a sharp fall in
profits for the half-year.
	   Mitsubishi's parent pretax profits fell to 50.6 billion yen
(dlrs 424 million) from 74.31 billion yen (dlrs 622 million) a year
earlier.
	   Its parent net profit dropped to 29.29 billion yen (dlrs 245
million) from 43.3 billion yen (dlrs 363 million).
	   The company said orders fell as Japan's recession caused the
private sector to invest less in new factories and equipment.

Bomb-scarred town gets lottery money for reconstruction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The town that suffered the worst
terrorist strike in Northern Ireland's 30-year conflict has been
awarded 900,000 pounds (dlrs 1.5 million) in lottery money for an
extensive rebuilding program, officials announced Tuesday.
	   A car bomb planted by Irish Republican Army dissidents exploded
in Omagh on Aug. 15, killing 29 people and injuring 370.
	   The Heritage Lottery Fund money will be used to help reconstruct
Lower Market Street, which took the brunt of the blast.
	   ``This is very timely, coming just as demolition work is
complete and we are about to try and move forward,'' said John
McKinney, chief executive of the Omagh District Council.
	   McKinney said some of the money also will be spent on creating a
memorial to the victims of the bomb.
	   ``Most people would like to see some sort of reflective area,
but they also want to see something different there,'' he said.
``They don't want to have to look at that street and see it how it
was on August 15.''

Libya to export fuel oil to Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Cash-strapped Yugoslavia will
receive 500,000 tons of fuel oil from Libya as a compensation for
unpaid construction work in the Arab country, media said Tuesday.
	   The deal was signed during this week's visit to Libya by
Yugoslav Vice Premier Zoran Lilic. First shipment of fuel oil is
expected in Yugoslavia within 15 days, the state Tanjug news agency
reported.
	   For years, several Yugoslav construction companies have claimed
nearly dlrs 100 million for their work in Libya. They had demanded
cash or fuel oil as a compensation.
	   Tanjug said ``since all financial problems were settled'' during
Lilic's visit, Yugoslavia offered over a dlrs one billion worth of
goods to Libya, and contracts were signed for dlrs 120 million
worth of different unspecified merchandise.
	   Yugoslavia and Libya have maintained close political and
economic ties despite claims by other Arab countries that
Yugoslavia has been leading anti-Muslim policies while it fought
wars in Bosnia and Serbia's province of Kosovo.
	   Yugoslavia, which is faced with deep economic problems because
of mismanagement and nationalist policies, badly needed fuel oil
ahead of the winter heating season.
	   Last week, Belgrade offered Russia food supplies and
construction services in exchange for 100,000 tons of fuel oil. The
deal is being considered in Moscow.

China detains democracy activists in crackdown

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Xu, others released, edits to trim and conform &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police detained one of China's most prominent
democracy activists and other dissidents Tuesday in an effort to
thwart a planned cross-country trip to protest the harassment of a
fellow activist.
	   Police took Xu Wenli from his Beijing home, questioned him about
his planned trip Tuesday to eastern Shandong province and released
him about 10 hours later, Xu said.
	   They also searched Xu's home, confiscating a fax machine,
papers, magazines and photos, and detained Xu's associate, Zhang
Hui. There was no immediate word on whether Zhang was also
released.
	   Xu's wife, He Xintong, said the detentions demonstrated that
authorities have no intention of relaxing their grip despite
China's Oct. 5 signing of a U.N. human rights treaty, the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
	   ``This is their real face,'' she said in an interview. ``The
Communist Party says one thing but does another.''
	   A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said he was
unaware of the detentions. But he said China signed the U.N. pact
to safeguard citizens' rights, and remained determined to do so.
	   Zhou Guoqiang, another dissident who planned to go with Xu to
Shandong, said he was detained, questioned and released 12 hours
later. Also detained and later released was Wang Zhixin, but there
was no immediate news on the whereabouts of Cha Jianguo, who also
planned to go to Shandong, said Xu.
	   A Hong Kong-based rights group said four other dissidents were
detained Tuesday in Beijing and elsewhere, and that police also
questioned nearly 20 others, including many who planned to travel
to Shandong.
	   The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement
said that in all, some 40 dissidents had been detained or
questioned in the past three days.
	   Xu had said he and as many as 30 dissidents from Beijing and
elsewhere were going to Shandong's Dongping County, some 450
kilometers (280 miles) south of Beijing, to support Xie Wanjun, a
fellow activist who has been harassed.
	   Xie was detained last month and held for 15 days for attempting
to file an application with the authorities to set up an opposition
group, the China Democracy Party.
	   Since July, dissidents have tried to register branches of the
party in at least nine provinces and major cities, challenging a
virtual 49-year ban on organized opposition to the ruling Communist
Party.
	   Authorities rejected all the applications and detained at least
20 dissidents, mostly for brief periods.
	   Since his release, Xie has been ordered to leave his home by
Nov. 1, his wife has been sacked and his electricity and telephone
have been cut off, Xu's wife said.
	   With many other dissidents exiled abroad, Xu, 56, is one of the
most prominent democracy campaigners left in China. Xu was jailed
after the Democracy Wall protest movement of the late 1970s and
freed in 1993, having served all but three years of a 15-year
sentence, much of it in solitary confinement.

Ukraine and U.N. stepping up efforts to accommodate Crimean Tatars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The United Nations and the Ukrainian
government are planning a dlrs 2.3 million campaign to accelerate
the process of granting citizenship and improving living conditions
for thousands of Crimean Tatars returning to their homeland,
officials said Tuesday.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees would allocate the money
next year for an information campaign in Crimea explaining to
Tatars the citizenship acquisition procedures, said the UNHCR
director for Europe, Anne Bijleveld.
	   The money would be also used to help the Tatars start their own
businesses and accommodate those whose living conditions need to be
improved, Bijleveld told a news conference.
	   Bijleveld arrived in Ukraine last week to discuss with
government officials joint activities in solving the problems of
Crimean Tatars and other ethnic groups who seek asylum in Ukraine.
	   More than 250,000 Crimean Tatars have returned to Ukraine over
the past decade. Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin exiled them to
Central Asia for allegedly helping the Nazi cause in World War II.
	   Although the Ukrainian government has spent about dlrs 300
million since 1992 to provide housing for the returning Tatars, at
least half of them still do not have a permanent place to live.
	   Many of the returning Tatars also have encountered citizenship
problems because they lacked either money or proper identification
documents.
	   About 81,000 Tatars are still citizens of other countries, while
16,700 others have no citizenship at all, according to the
Ukrainian government.
	   Bijleveld said these people can now hope to become Ukrainian
citizens much quicker following a recent agreement between Ukraine
and Uzbekistan that simplified citizenship acquisition procedures.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 20 school children in southern Russia
were hospitalized after suffering reactions to a shot testing
whether they had tuberculosis, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   About 750 children in the Stavropol region, about 1,200
kilometers (750 miles) south of Moscow, were given the TB test as
part of a planned medical checkup, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   But 23 of the children suffered a serious reaction to the drug,
and had to be rushed to a hospital. Their condition has since
stabilized, but they have not fully recovered, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The drug was produced locally by a state-run pharmaceutical
plant.
	   Local authorities are looking into the incident, ITAR-Tass said.

	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ An avalanche on the 8,163-meter
(26,940-foot) Mt. Manaslu swept away a Colombian mountaineer, the
Nepalese tourism ministry said Tuesday.
	   Five members of a Colombian expedition were descending Monday
from camp two at 6,100 meters (20,130 feet) to camp one at 5,900
meters (19,470 feet), when the avalanche swept away Lenin Granados,
31, from Bogota, the ministry said.
	   The four others managed to escape.

Libya to export fuel oil to Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Cash-strapped Yugoslavia will
receive 500,000 tons of fuel oil from Libya as a compensation for
unpaid construction work in the Arab country, media said Tuesday.
	   The deal was signed during this week's visit to Libya by
Yugoslav Vice Premier Zoran Lilic. First shipment of fuel oil is
expected in Yugoslavia within 15 days, the state Tanjug news agency
reported.
	   For years, several Yugoslav construction companies have claimed
nearly dlrs 100 million for their work in Libya. They had demanded
cash or fuel oil as a compensation.
	   Tanjug said ``since all financial problems were settled'' during
Lilic's visit, Yugoslavia offered over a dlrs one billion worth of
goods to Libya, and contracts were signed for dlrs 120 million
worth of different unspecified merchandise.
	   Yugoslavia and Libya have maintained close political and
economic ties despite claims by other Arab countries that
Yugoslavia has been leading anti-Muslim policies while it fought
wars in Bosnia and Serbia's province of Kosovo.
	   Yugoslavia, which is faced with deep economic problems because
of mismanagement and nationalist policies, badly needed fuel oil
ahead of the winter heating season.
	   Last week, Belgrade offered Russia food supplies and
construction services in exchange for 100,000 tons of fuel oil. The
deal is being considered in Moscow.

<TEXT>
	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces scrambled Tuesday
to meet a NATO deadline for pulling back in Kosovo, and hundreds of
ethnic Albanian refugees began returning to their homes for the
first time in months.
	   The private radio station B-92 quoted Serb sources Tuesday as
saying the withdrawal was complete. International observers were
out in force in the majority ethnic Albanian province to verify
those claims.
	   U.S. officials in Washington said the Clinton administration
wanted to make sure the pullback was genuine before declaring that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had satisfied the terms of
the deal he accepted to end the crisis over Kosovo.
	   ``We want to make sure the movements are a real withdrawal and
not a reconfiguration (of forces),'' White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said.
	   Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 have been driven from
their homes in fighting since Milosevic launched a crackdown in
late February against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and
most want independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The 16-nation NATO alliance has threatened to launch airstrikes
unless Milosevic halts his crackdown and cuts his forces to levels
in place before the conflict began.
	   NATO ambassadors were to meet Tuesday in Brussels, Belgium,
prior to the 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) deadline for Milosevic to
comply.
	   ``They're going down to the wire,'' said Shaun Byrnes, head of
the U.S. section of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission, which
has been monitoring the situation since July. ``It's been the
pattern.''
	   A NATO source in Brussels, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the ambassadors probably would wait until shortly before the
deadline to declare whether Milosevic had met the conditions. The
deadline has already been extended once.
	   In this former rebel stronghold 30 miles (50 kilometers)
southwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital, hundreds of ethnic
Albanians swarmed the streets, visiting homes and shops they
abandoned when Serb forces overran the town in July.
	   As if to underscore the uncertainty of the situation, the crowds
disappeared after a few bursts of automatic gunfire rang out as a
military convoy rolled through headed toward Pristina.
	   Serb police said the shots came from somewhere in the village
and that they did not return fire. Just north of the town, a few
Kosovo Liberation Army rebels wandered up the road, fleeing when
they heard the Serbs approach.
	   In Malisevo, one of the townspeople, Osman Mazreku, said he fled
to a nearby village nearly three months ago with his wife, mother
and three children. His elderly father chose to remain behind. He
was arrested by police and has not been seen since, Osman said.
	   ``He said 'I'm old and they won't do anything to me,''' Osman
said. ``I was afraid something like this would happen.''
	   The top floor of Osman's two-story house had been gutted by
flames. Clothing, valuables and garbage were strewn across the
ground floor.
	   ``I'm sorry to see my house in this condition, but I'm happy to
be alive,'' he said. ``That's all that matters. I hope they'll let
me live here.''
	   As the withdrawal accelerated, Kosovo's Serb governor, Veljko
Odalovic, thanked the police for ``bringing peace to Kosovo'' and
pledged the province will be defended from ethnic Albanian
``terrorists'' with or without the police.
	   On Monday, tanks withdrew from roadside positions in the central
Drenica area where they had dug in since Oct. 18. At another
checkpoint, in Dragobilje, which was occupied by heavily armed Serb
police a few days earlier, a uniformed ethnic Albanian guerrilla
stood holding an automatic rifle.

Forty-seven killed in Russia's fleet since start of year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Forty-seven sailors in Russia's Northern Fleet
have been killed or committed suicide so far this year, a news
agency said Tuesday.
	   Twelve were killed by their colleagues, 14 committed suicide and
the rest died in accidents, ITAR-Tass reported, citing the military
prosecutor's office.
	   Abysmal living conditions, ritual hazings and weak morale have
contributed to a steady string of shootings and suicides in the
military. About 50 soldiers were killed by other servicemen last
year, and about 500 committed suicide, according to the military.
	   Suicide has also become widespread among officers, who go
without pay for months and are unable to support their families.

Subbing for ailing Yeltsin, Primakov arrives to brief EU on
</HEADLINE>
economic recovery plan
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Primakov, Klestil comments &QL; 
 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Substituting for an ailing Boris Yeltsin,
Russia's prime minister flew Tuesday to brief the European Union on
economic recovery plans and seek help in coping with Moscow's worst
economic crisis of the post-Soviet era.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov made the one-day trip to lead a
Russian delegation after doctors ordered the Russian president to
stay home. Yeltsin checked into a sanatorium Tuesday for an
unspecified ``course of restoration treatment,'' the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Following official welcoming ceremonies with Austrian President
Thomas Klestil, Primakov met Prime Minister Viktor Klima; the head
of the European Commission Jacques Santer and EU Commissioner Hans
van den Broek.
	   Primakov was expected to ask for better access for Russian
products into EU markets to help the country revive its economy.
	   During his courtesy call on Klestil, Primakov praised Austria's
role as a neutral, non-NATO country, saying the ``neutral status of
Austria has helped not hurt'' it.
	   The Austria Press Agency said Klestil said he hoped Russia would
stick to the reform course, which would produce results, ``which
all of us in Europe need.''
	   Primakov was accompanied to Vienna by Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and several other ministers in charge of economic and
financial policies.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency. Klima and
the others will be seeking not only assurances that Russia has a
viable plan for economic recovery but will also try to gauge the
impact of Yeltsin's health problems on Russia's overall stability.
	   Primakov, the former foreign minister, has been prime minister
for only six weeks and has yet to produce his own blueprint to deal
with the country's deep-rooted economic problems.
	   He is, however, widely respected by all political factions and
is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when Yeltsin has
receded into the background.
	   Before leaving Moscow, Primakov held talks with Yeltsin at the
president's country residence outside of Moscow, Yeltsin's press
service said.
	   Yeltsin authorized him to tell EU officials about the
government's plan to cope with the latest economic crisis,
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Russia's economic crisis, coupled with major downturns in East
Asia and Latin America, has sent shock waves through Europe at a
time when EU governments have taken a major turn to the left.
	   During their summit last weekend in Poertschach, Austria, the
EU's 15 leaders pledged to coordinate economic policies to cope
with financial crises in Russia and elsewhere.
	   The Europeans, however, have made clear that Russia must stick
by its reform course if it is to expect international help to
overcome the crisis.

Russia asks NATO to revoke plans for strikes against Serbia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with deputy foreign minister comment in last graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia asked NATO on Tuesday to revoke its threat
of airstrikes against Yugoslavia, saying that deployment of
international observers to Kosovo province means a peaceful
settlement there is possible.
	   ``There is no alternative to a non-violent settlement of the
Kosovo problem,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   A United Nations resolution ``gives the green light to launching
an OSCE mission, therefore continuing the process of a peaceful,
political settlement,'' said the statement quoted by the Interfax
news agency.
	   Observers under the command of the 54-country Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe are to see whether Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic is complying with a NATO demand to
pull back his forces before a 1900 GMT deadline Tuesday.
	   Milosevic has made a significant last-minute pullback of his
military and police forces from Kosovo, whose mainly ethnic
Albanian population wants independence.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry also praised Moscow's role in averting
airstrikes so far. Russia adamantly opposes the use of force
against Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, with which it
shares Slavic and Orthodox religious roots.
	   ``Russia has maintained a firm and resolute position,'' the
statement said. ``The most important thing has been accomplished:
All clauses directly or indirectly sanctioning automatic use of
force in spite of the priorities of the Security Council, bypassing
the U.N. Charter, have been scrapped.''
	   The deputy speaker of the lower house of parliament, Sergei
Baburin, also hailed the developments as Russia's ``return to big
politics,'' Interfax reported.
	   The world ``forgot the Russia that says `No,' and the memory has
to be refreshed,'' Baburin said.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev, meanwhile, said that
Russia would try to prevent any attempts by ethnic Albanian
separatists to disrupt the peace process, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.

Hamed finally heads for United States and Saturday fight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After a two-day delay caused by visa problems,
``Prince'' Naseem Hamed flew to the United States on Tuesday for
Saturday's WBO featherweight defense against Wayne McCullough in
Atlantic City.
	   Hamed, who was supposed to have arrived in the States on Sunday,
had to delay his departure because his handlers waited until the
last minute to apply for his visa.
	   British newspapers said the American pay-TV company HBO was
furious that Hamed had missed major promotion events in New York,
Atlantic City and Philadelphia.
	   Promoter Frank Warren, blamed by HBO for Hamed's late arrival,
tried to be upbeat.
	   ``All the problems have been solved,'' he said at Heathrow
airport. ``There was a problem with the visa and it's all been
sorted. That's why we're getting on the plane.''
	   Hamed, despite the mix-up and a falling out with trainer Brendan
Ingle, predicted a quick fight as he boarded the Concorde
accompanied by family members and Warren.
	   ``I'll win in three,'' he said, thrusting three fingers in the
air. ``You can put your house on it. You couldn't lose.''
	   Hamed, 30-0 with 28 knockouts, is making his 11th title defense.
McCullough, an Irishman, is 22-1 with 14 KOs.

Pinochet lawyers argue in court his arrest was illegal

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two Chilean admirals canceled a trip to buy
British warships to protest the arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
and four Chilean exiles who say they were tortured by his secret
police launched a legal bid Tuesday to have the former dictator
tried in Britain.
	   In the High Court, on the final day of a two-day case to get
Pinochet released immediately, lawyers for a Spanish magistrate
seeking his extradition on charges of murder, torture and
kidnapping argued that, under international law, the former Chilean
dictator is liable to stand trial for human rights abuses committed
during his 17-year-rule.
	   Lawyer Alun Jones, who also represents British prosecutors, said
abuses committed by a ruler are not ``something that is in the
furtherance of his function as head of state.''
	   Lawyers for the 82-year-old Pinochet, who was arrested in a
London hospital Oct. 16, argued Monday that the Spanish warrant is
illegal both because ex-heads of state cannot be prosecuted for
actions committed while in power and because he is not Spanish.
	   The three judges were expected to give a ruling Wednesday.
	   As the hearing continued, the British Defense Ministry said the
Chilean admirals had called off a trip to negotiate the possible
purchase of three surplus Type 22 frigates from the Royal Navy _
H.M.S. Beaver, H.M.S. Boxer and H.M.S. London.
	   Published reports said Vice Adm. Hernan Couioumdjian, deputy
commander of the Chilean navy, and Vice Adm. Onofre Torres were to
negotiate a deal worth 60 million pounds (dlrs 102 million). The
Defense Ministry refused to provide a figure.
	   ``The visit has been postponed because it was felt by the
Chileans to be inappropriate in the circumstances,'' a Defense
Ministry spokesman told the AP, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. He added that Chile was among ``a number of nations''
interested in the frigates.
	   The bid by the four Chilean exiles, three of whom live in
Britain, to have Pinochet tried here was the latest attempt to stop
him getting home.
	   Exile groups fear Britain's Labor Party government will release
him on humanitarian grounds. Right-wing Chilean senators who
visited him at the London clinic where he underwent back surgery
Oct. 9 say he is very ill and frail.
	   On Monday, Swiss authorities requested Pinochet's arrest and
extradition following a criminal complaint filed in Geneva by the
widow of a student with dual Swiss-Chilean nationality who
disappeared in 1977.
	   A similar complaint by the daughter of a French man who
disappeared was filed Monday in a Paris court, and exiles in Sweden
also are trying to file a suit.
	   ``These are torture victims not out for revenge, but for
justice,'' said David Burgess, the London lawyer who filed the
request to try Pinochet in Britain.
	   A spokeswoman for the Attorney General's office said the request
had been received, adding, ``We are looking at it as quickly as
possible.''
	   The Spanish magistrate has issued a new extradition warrant to
cover an unspecified number of murders, tortures and kidnappings up
to 1992, two years after Pinochet stood down. He remained
commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were killed
or disappeared after Pinochet seized power from a leftist
government in 1973.

 &UR; Wolpe discusses Congo fighting with Museveni &QL; 
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Howard Wolpe, the U.S. special envoy to
the Great Lakes Region and President Yoweri Museveni discussed ways
of ending the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a senior
official said Tuesday.
	   ``They discussed proposals so far made by the region on how to
resolve the conflict in the DRC,'' said Museveni's press secretary,
Hope Kivengere, in a statement on the Monday meeting.
	   Wolpe was ``particularly interested in the mechanism for the
implementation of a cease-fire and subsequent negotiations with a
view to seeing how his government can be of assistance,'' the
statement said.
	   Wolpe's whereabouts were unknown Tuesday and Kivengere would
only say he ``came to meet the president and he must have gone back
on that same day.''
	   Relations between Museveni's government and Washington are good
and the East Africa nation has been a recipient of substantial U.S.
economic and non-lethal military assistance.
	   Wolpe's previously unannounced visit coincided with the start of
talks on the Congolese war in Lusaka, Zambia, by defense, foreign
ministers and officials from 12 African nations.
	   The talks resumed Tuesday for an unscheduled second day after
late night sessions that failed to produce a cease-fire.
	   But discussions were again plagued by acrimony, the official
Zimbabwe news agency reported from Lusaka.
	   Zimbabwe has more than 5,000 troops backing President Laurent
Kabila's forces in Congo.
	   Officials from Rwanda and Uganda and Congo ``hurled abuse at
each other,'' dimming hopes of an agreement, the Zimbabwe Inter
African News Agency said.
	   Uganda, which denies supporting rebels trying to oust Kabila,
has said it will maintain troops in eastern Congo until the Ugandan
rebel Democratic Alliance Forces cease to be a threat.
	   Rwanda, which with Uganda helped Kabila oust the late dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko, has denied sending troops on the rebels side.

	   KIRYAT ARBA, West Bank (AP) _ Making good on a promise of
renewed security cooperation with Israel, Palestinian agents on
Tuesday arrested two suspects in the killing of a Jewish settler, a
spokesman for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said.
	   The victim, 29-year-old security guard Danny Vargas from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, was shot dead Monday in the town
of Hebron in an apparent attack by Palestinian militants.
	   At Vargas' open grave, politicians and friends delivering
eulogies demanded Tuesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu go
back on his promise to withdraw from West Bank land.
	   ``You promised us peace and security, and we have neither,''
said legislator Rehavam Zeevi from the far-right opposition party
Moledet, referring to Netanyahu. His speech was punctuated by
shouts of ``wage war'' by some of the mourners.
	   Vargas' killing and the slaying of an elderly Palestinian man
later Monday, apparently by a Jewish extremist, put the new
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement to a first test.
	   A centerpiece of the agreement, which calls for an Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, is a pledge by the
Palestinians to work harder to rein in militants.
	   Demonstrating a new attitude, Palestinian security forces who
had suspended cooperation with Israel for most of the past 17
months on Tuesday arrested two suspects in the Vargas killing.
	   Ahmed Tibi, a spokesman for Arafat, said one of the men was
believed to have shot Vargas and another to have served as an
accomplice. The two men are residents of Hebron, but Tibi did not
say whether they had ties to a Palestinian political faction.
	   The two suspects also confessed to killing a Jewish seminary
student earlier this month near the communal farm of Ora south of
Jerusalem, Tibi said.
	   Netanyahu, meanwhile, condemned Monday's two slayings and said
that despite the violence and opposition from Israeli hardliners,
he was determined to carry out the peace agreement.
	   ``The only thing that can prevent the implementation of the
agreement is if the (Israeli) Cabinet does not approve it, or if
the Palestinians do not fulfill it,'' Netanyahu said.
	   The Cabinet was to convene on Thursday, and the peace agreement
was expected to win narrow approval.
	   Trying to assure Jewish settlers that they would be safe,
Netanyahu said none of the 144 settlements would become isolated
enclaves as a result of the troop withdrawal and that the main
north-south highway would remain under full Israeli control.
	   Israel has not yet released maps. However, according to a
pullback map published earlier this week in the Israeli daily
Yediot Ahronot, seven settlements would become islands in
Palestinian areas.
	   Netanyahu also said the United States had promised to deliver
clarifications on the new Palestinian security plan by the end of
the week.
	   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Israel was also expecting a series of statements from the U.S.
administration that would bolster Netanyahu's position, including
his opposition to a unilateral Palestinian declaration of statehood
at the end of the autonomy period in May 1999.
	   In troubled Hebron, meanwhile, Israeli troops enforced a curfew
on the downtown area they control, barring some 30,000 Palestinians
there from leaving their homes. The army also sealed the city, and
Palestinians were not allowed to enter or leave.
	   The restrictions, coming after the settler killing, embittered
many Palestinians who had hoped that life would improve as a result
of the peace agreement.
	   ``We thought that we could now go to Gaza, but we cannot even
leave our homes,'' said Hebron resident Khalil Jaberi, 26,
referring to a provision in the accord for a new land route for
Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   In the northern West Bank, hundreds of Palestinians clashed with
Israeli troops near the Balata and Askar refugee camps to protest
Monday's killing of 65-year-old Palestinian Mohammed Zalout.
	   Soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse
Palestinian stone throwers, and two Palestinians were injured.
	   Zalout was bludgeoned to death, and Israeli police reportedly
were searching for a suspect, a young Israeli man.

Report: Myanmar army prepares drive against heroin makers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAE HONG SON, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's army has sent six
battalions to wipe out heroin refineries along its border with
Thailand, a Thai intelligence officer said Tuesday.
	   The Thai military suspects that the offensive may be linked to a
dispute between the army and local warlords over protection money
from the heroin producers, said the officer, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   Myanmar, also called Burma, has long been one of the world's top
producers of opium and its derivative, heroin. Until recently, most
of the heroin found in the United States had come from the Golden
Triangle region where the borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand
meet.
	   In recent years, Myanmar's military government has stepped up
its war on drug producers, an offensive that culminated in 1996
with the surrender of Khun Sa, then the world's most notorious
heroin trafficker.
	   Production of heroin failed to abate, and the trade in the drug
passed from the hands of the Shan minority _ to which Khun Sa
belonged _ to other groups, such as the Wa.
	   On Oct. 15, the Myanmar army's Eastern Command sent six
battalions, each with about 500 troops, to attack several heroin
refineries, all believed to be guarded by heavily armed guerrillas
belonging to ethnic minority groups, said the Thai intelligence
officer.
	   Last week, the troops attacked a refinery belonging to a group
of ethnic Chinese and members of the Lahu minority near Mong Thaw
in the southern part of Shan State, killing two armed guards and
forcing 50 guards and 20 laboratory workers to flee to Thailand, he
said.
	   The 50 guards at Mong Thaw were under the command of Maj. Lern
Herng, an ethnic Shan and a former commander in Khun Sa's Mong Tai
Army.
	   Lern Herng and 51 of his men surrendered Monday to the army's
65th Battalion and handed over 30 AK-47 and 12 M-16 assault rifles,
seven grenades, 10 pistols, seven rocket launchers and one 60mm
mortar, said the Thai officer.
	   The surrender took place at the battalion headquarters in Mong
Ton, across from Thailand's Chiang Mai province, 580 kilometers
(360 miles) north of Bangkok.
	   The Myanmar army's command post at Ho Mong, Khun Sa's former
stronghold, also informed the Thai military that government troops
have relocated 95 families from villages in Shan State's Muang Tha
district as part of an effort to root out drug producers from the
local communities.
	   Myanmar's junta, ostracized by many Western countries for its
poor human rights record and failure to turn over power to a
democratically elected government, has touted successes in the war
against drugs.
	   But critics, including the U.S. State Department, note that
Myanmar's heroin trade was estimated to be worth dlrs 1.2 billion
in 1997, and suspect that the army may overlook drug dealing and in
some local cases profit from it.
	   They also point out that former drug barons are now living
freely in the Myanmar capital, Yangon, and have been encouraged to
make huge legitimate investments in the economy. Khun Sa, who is
wanted by a U.S. federal court, was granted an amnesty and not
punished for any offenses.

Liberal South African judge dies of leukemia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ John Didcott, a judge who tried to
soften the impact of harsh apartheid-era laws and who rose to sit
on South Africa's highest court, is dead at age 67 of leukemia.
	   Reluctant to join the bench during apartheid because he would
have to administer the system of white rule, Didcott decided to do
so after concluding he could try to alleviate the impact of unjust
laws.
	   While a judge on the provincial Natal Supreme Court, Didcott and
two other judges blasted an apartheid law which allowed people
deemed ``idle and undesirable'' to be jailed under hard labor for a
year. The judges' 1983 decision led to the government scrapping the
law.
	   Didcott proposed in 1988 that the state provide legal counsel to
indigent defendants _ a move that a higher apartheid-era court
overturned.
	   Didcott opposed the death penalty and never sentenced anyone to
death during his career.
	   ``South Africa has experienced too much savagery,'' he wrote in
one case, adding that the state must demonstrate ``the priceless
value it places on the lives of all its subjects _ even the
worst.''
	   ``He used the opportunities presented to him on the bench to do
what he could with existing laws to promote the cause of human
rights,'' Julian von Klemperer, president of the Natal Law Society,
was quoted as saying by The Star, a Johannesburg newspaper.
	   Didcott was appointed to the Constitutional Court _ the highest
tribunal in South Africa _ in 1994 by President Nelson Mandela.
	   Didcott died on Oct. 20.
	   He is survived by his wife Pam, his mother Flo and two
daughters.

Artist inspired by Clinton scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An Indian artist incensed by the scandal
involving U.S. President Bill Clinton and a former White House
intern has put his feelings on canvas, opening an exhibit titled
``Clinton and Monica'' on Tuesday.
	   Artist Mohsin Shaikh, who took three months to complete the
paintings, said he felt compelled to paint the oils because
Clinton's inappropriate actions within the White House meant that
no woman was safe.
	   ``I want to tell the truth to the world,'' Shaikh said as the
exhibit opened in a trendy New Delhi gallery.
	   ``Super power in super abandon,'' read the title of a painting
showing former intern Monica Lewinsky kneeling in front of Clinton,
who is standing on the presidential seal.
	   Several paintings showed Clinton in intimate embrace with
Lewinsky. Some paintings used the White House as a backdrop.
	   Khushwant Singh, a popular New Delhi who spoke at the opening,
said the paintings should be viewed as simple erotica.
	   Shaikh did not seem interested in profiting from Clinton's
embarrassment. He said he had not thought about selling the
painting, but would be interested in taking the exhibit to other
parts of the world.

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince urges peace in region
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MUNIR AHMED &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) - Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah on
Tuesday called for peace in neighboring Afghanistan, condemned
terrorism world wide and urged the world's newest nuclear powers to
settle their disputes peacefully.
	   At the end of his three day visit to Pakistan, Abdullah and
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif issued a joint communique calling for
the troubled Kashmir dispute to be settled through United Nations
resolutions calling for a plebiscite.
	   The Himalayan state of Kashmir shot to international prominence
after both India and Pakistan exploded underground nuclear devices
and declared themselves nuclear states.
	   The two South Asian neighbors have fought three wars over
Kashmir, divided between Pakistan and India at the end of British
colonial rule in the subcontinent.
	   They fought a third war over Bangladesh in 1971 or what was then
East Pakistan.
	   Abdullah and Sharif ``agreed that the establishment of peace and
security in South Asia required the non-use of force.''
	   Earlier this month Pakistan and India held their first round of
talks in more than one year but they concluded without any movement
toward a settlement to outstanding disputes.
	   The joint communique issued by Abdullah and Sharif also
reiterated their support for United Nations efforts to bring peace
to war-ravaged Afghanistan.
	   Saudi Arabia, one of only three countries including Pakistan to
recognize the Taliban religious army, withdrew its envoy from
Afghanistan after a disagreement between the Taliban's reclusive
leader Mullah Mohammed Omar and the Saudi Arabian intelligence
chief Turki Bin Fazl.
	   It's not clear what the dispute was about, but newspapers in
Pakistan said it was over the Taliban's refusal to hand over Saudi
dissident and suspected terrorist, Osama bin Laden, believed by
Washington to have masterminded the August bombings of U.S.
embassies in East Africa.
	   The Taliban this week launched a judicial inquiry into
accusations of terrorism against bin Laden. The inquiry will
collect evidence and decide whether to lay charges.
	   The joint communique of Abdullah and Sharif ``condemned
terrorism in all its forms and manifestations irrespective of race,
motivation and religion.''

Seven party supporters killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ A bomb attack early Tuesday linked to
political rivalries killed seven workers of the Telugu Desam Party
that governs the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.
	   Police officials in Hyderabad, the state capital, said the
attackers descended on Konganapally, a village 450 kilometers south
of Hyderabad, with bombs and set fire to 12 houses. Several people
were injured in addition to the seven killed.
	   Police said the attack appeared to be in retaliation for the
killing last January of a member of a Marxist group known as
Kondapally Seetharamiah. One of those killed Tuesday was a suspect
in the January killing.
	   The region is notorious for political violence and killings.

Turkey asks Moscow to extradite Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey has asked Russia to extradite a
Kurdish rebel leader wanted on charges of heading a terrorist
organization, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
	   Abdullah Ocalan leads the banned Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK,
which has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984.
The conflict has killed about 37,000.
	   Ocalan's whereabouts are unclear.
	   Turkey says he recently left Syria for Russia. But in Moscow,
the Interfax news agency said Monday that the Federal Security
Service has not confirmed Ocalan's presence in Russia.
	   ``Contact is being maintained with the Turkish special services.
We asked them about the possibility of Ocalan's using false
documents to enter Russia,'' the intelligence agency said through a
spokesman, Interfax said.
	   Turkish newspapers have said Ocalan was in hiding in a suburb
some 30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Moscow.
	   As for Ocalan, he issued a statement last week saying he was
somewhere in Kurdistan, a region that stretches over parts of
Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria.
	   Sermet Atacanli, a spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry,
said the extradition request was filed Monday in Moscow, along with
a diplomatic protest over Ocalan's supposed presence in Russia.
	   We have determined that this man is (in Russia) and have asked
them to return him,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ After several weeks of surveillance, police seized
a record amount of cocaine -- 184 kilograms (405 pounds) -- in a
raid on the outskirts of Paris, police officials said Tuesday.
	   Police described the cocaine seized in the Monday night raid as
pure and said it had an estimated street value of more than 110
million francs (dlrs 20 million). The drug was destined for
France's domestic market, they said.
	   Six members of an international drug-trafficking ring, several
of whom are known criminals, were arrested during the raid. Police
said they also seized arms and several hundred thousand francs.
	   The nationalities of the six people arrested were not made
public, and police did not provide precise information of where the
raid took place.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Japan all but clinched a place in next year's
Rugby World Cup finals when it trounced Taiwan 134-6 Tuesday in the
final round of Asian qualifying play.
	   The Japanese, who beat South Korea 40-12 in their first
qualifying match Saturday, scored 20 tries in their overwhelming
victory over Taiwan.
	   It was the third highest winning score in Rugby World Cup
history.
	   A victory by South Korea over underdog Hong Kong later Tuesday
night would put Japan in the 20-nation finals in Wales. It has
represented Asia in the last three finals.
	   Only the group winner among the four teams is certain to advance
to the World Cup finals next year, though the runner-up will have a
second chance in a repechage tournament.
	   Leading Japan's effort was winger Terunori Masuho with five
tries. Flyhalf Keiji Hirose kicked a perfect 10 for 10 conversions.

Lawyer seeks the release of American held in Rome
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian court has refused to release an American
arrested three weeks ago for allegedly selling human organs over
the Internet, his lawyer said Tuesday.
	   The American, identified as James F. Cohan, 57, of Los Angeles,
California, was arrested Oct. 6 in a Rome hotel in what news
reports described as a sting operation by Italian police.
	   Police, posing as organ buyers, reportedly lured him to the
hotel by offering him dlrs 20,000 for a kidney.
	   Cohan has been charged with trafficking in organs and criminal
association.
	   The defense sought his release during a hearing Saturday, but
the court refused to lift the custody order because of the criminal
association charge, said Cohan's Italian lawyer, Paolo Fava.
	   Fava denied any wrongdoing by his client. He acknowledged Cohan
tried to arrange transplants, but only through legal channels. The
lawyer declined to elaborate.
	   The lawyer also denied that Cohan was involved with any criminal
organization and said he planned to appeal the detention order to

Troubled Congolese peace talks go into second day

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ President Frederick Chiluba intervened
Tuesday to try to jar loose progress in deadlocked talks to end the
fighting in Congo.
	   Chiluba called the Rwandan and Ugandan foreign ministers to his
official residence after acrimonious exchanges between them and
Congolese officials and their allies, officials said.
	   The talks are the latest effort to bring a cease-fire to the
three-month-old civil war in the vast central African country,
which has drawn in Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and reportedly
Sudan on the government's side. Rwanda and Uganda favor the rebels.
	   Congolese Foreign Minister Jean Charles Okoto accused Rwanda and
Uganda of boycotting the morning session. A Rwandan spokeswoman
denied the charge.
	   Okoto told reporters the two central African nations spurned
Congolese demands to withdraw their forces from backing rebels
fighting to overthrow President Laurent Kabila.
	   ``It is imperative these two countries move out of Congo,'' he
told reporters. ``If nothing conclusive comes out on this, we will
continue fighting.''
	   Okoto also described Bizima Karaha, leader of a rebel delegation
in Lusaka, as ``a terrorist. He needs to be arrested immediately.''
	   Rwanda denies it has forces in Congo. Uganda acknowledges it has
soldiers in the country, but says they are there only to strike at
Ugandan rebels based across the border.
	   No details were released of Chiluba's talks with the Rwandans
and Ugandans.
	   Defense, foreign ministers and officials from 12 African nations
reconvened in full session later Tuesday, following late night
sessions Monday that failed to produce a cease-fire.
	   Officials from Rwanda and Uganda on one side and Congo on the
other ``hurled abuse at each other'' Tuesday, dimming hopes of an
agreement, the official Zimbabwe Inter African News Agency said
from Lusaka.
	   Zimbabwe has 5,000 troops backing Kabila in Congo.
	   Okoto accused Rwanda of having ``expansionist ambitions.''
	   He alleged Rwanda and Uganda had ``a hidden agenda'' to crush
ethnic Hutus opposed to their support for Tutsis, the region's
powerful minority ethnic group.
	   Rwanda Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana described Congo as ``the
destabilizing element'' in the central African region and said
Congo was allowing its territory to be used as a springboard for
attacks by Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   The 14-nation Southern African Development Community and
continent-wide Organization of African Unity are sponsoring the
talks.
	   Officials from Zambia, Tanzania, South Africa, the United
Nations and the two organizations conferred with rebel
representatives Tuesday, handing over a six-page cease-fire
proposal drawn up by African and U.N. experts.
	   The rebels have been excluded from the talks but to ease
mediation efforts they were moved late Monday to rooms in the hotel
where the ministers are gathered.
	   Kabila has repeatedly refused to meet with the rebels at
previous peace talks.
	   On Monday, rebel spokesman Wamba dia Wamba said the rebels were
demanding direct talks with the Congolese government before
agreeing to a cease-fire.
	   The rebel forces, composed of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted
members of Kabila's army and opposition politicians, accuse Kabila
of corruption, mismanagement and stirring up ethnic rivalries.
	   The southern African nations of Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia
have sent troops and equipment to back Kabila and fended off a
rebel advance on the capital, Kinshasa, in August.
	   Last week, Kabila's military allies announced they will mount
pan offensive against rebel strongholds in the rugged jungle
terrain of eastern Congo.

NATO studies Serb redeployment ahead of airstrike deadline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO ambassadors analyzed reports of a
Serb military redeployment in Kosovo before a key meeting Tuesday
to decide whether to lift or extend the threat of airstrikes
against Serb forces.
	   Reports from Kosovo suggested President Slobodan Milosevic had
made a significant pullback of his military and police forces in
the province to meet international demands and avert NATO
intervention.
	   NATO had given Milosevic until 1900 GMT Tuesday to cut his
forces in Kosovo to levels in place before the conflict that flared
between the Serb military and ethnic Albanian separatists in
February.
	   The top policy-making body of the 16-nation alliance, the North
Atlantic Council, was to meet three hours ahead of that deadline to
decide what to do next.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a BBC interview
that NATO should not yet drop its guard despite ``serious
progress'' made by Milosevic toward meeting international demands.
``He still has some way to go and it may well be wise for us to
keep that threat hanging over him,'' Cook said.
	   Alliance officials said signs of increased compliance made
airstrikes very unlikely but added it was too early to judge if the
Serb troop withdrawal was sufficient for the airstrike threat to be
lifted.
	   Instead, the council was expected to set a new deadline for
complete compliance, or extend indefinitely the ``activation
order'' which is keeping some 400 allied warplanes on alert for
possible raids against the Serbs.
	   The ambassadors were studying reports from international
observers on the ground in Kosovo and NATO military, who are
operating unarmed observer flights over the province as part of the
Oct. 12 agreement between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   Convoys of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks carrying
Yugoslav troops and police were reported pulling out of several
parts of Kosovo on Monday and Tuesday morning.
	   But NATO sources said the ambassadors would likely wait until
shortly before the deadline to declare whether Milosevic met the
conditions.

meeting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Kazak court has fined a former prime minister
the equivalent of dlrs 800 for participating in an unauthorized
gathering, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   Akezhan Kazhegeldin was fined 6,600 tenge (dlrs 800) for
attending the founding meeting of the Movement for Fair Elections
on Oct. 2, Interfax said, citing Kazhegeldin's lawyers.
	   The court does not block Kazhegeldin from running in Jan. 10
presidential elections, his lawyers said.
	   However, the lawyers _ Vitaly Vorontsov and Fyodor Abramenko _
said the ruling was unconstitutional and promised to appeal.
	   Two more challengers are expected to run for president of this
Central Asian country, including Communist leader Serikbolsyn
Abdildin and a lawmaker in the upper house of parliament, Engels
Gabbasov, who is running as an independent.
	   But resident Nursultan Nazarbayev remains a clear favorite.
	   Nazarbayev's government has been criticized by international
human rights groups for restricting Kazakstan's opposition and the
media.

Poland vows to help Moldova resolve regional ethnic conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski told his
Moldovan counterpart Tuesday that Poland will help seek a peaceful
resolution to ethnic conflict in the secessionist Trans-Dniester
region.
	   Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi met with Kwasniewski at the
start of a two-day visit in Warsaw. Poland, which holds the
rotating chairmanship of the the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe this year, ``is ready to do everything'' to
end the conflict peacefully, Kwasniewski said.
	   He said foreign ministers from Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and
Poland plan to meet before the end of the year to discuss
Trans-Dniester, a sliver of land in eastern Moldova with a
population of 700,000 mainly ethnic Russians and Ukrainians.
	   The region declared independence in 1990 fearing that Moldova,
dominated by ethnic Romanians, would seek to reunite with
neighboring Romania. Moldova and the separatists fought a brief war
in 1992. After the fighting ceased, Russia sent in 5,000 troops.
Relations between the Moldovan government and the separatists
remain tense.
	   Last week, the presidents of Moldova, Ukraine and Romania urged
Russia to withdraw its troops from the breakaway region.
	   During Lucinschi's Poland visit, he and Kwasniewski are expected
to sign agreements on regional, military and labor cooperation.

German union to vote on merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WUERZBURG, Germany (AP) _ A German labor union was expected to
decide Tuesday if it wants to join a proposed merger of five labor
groups that would create one of the biggest unions in the world.
	   A key concern of delegates of Germany's print union, IG-Medien,
debating the plan in this Bavarian city is whether a bigger union
will succeed in strengthening Germany's labor movement.
	   Supporters hope the merger will help maintain labor's leverage
in an era of industry consolidation. Others questioned whether
bigger was better, and suggested the merger may make them more
unwieldy.
	   Also discussing the plan was HBV, a union representing the
banking and insurance sector, in the northern city of Bremen. HBV
is expected to vote for the merger.
	   Leaders of five of Germany's service industry unions _ DAG,
OeTV, IG Medien, HBV, and DPG _ agreed in principle in February on
plans to merge by around 2000.
	   A final decision isn't expected until November 1999.
	   The combined group would represent nearly 4 million employees,
including clerical, transportation, education, media and postal
workers.

Record price set at auction for famous Australian wine

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ A bottle of 1951 Penfolds Grange
Hermitage set a record for Australian wine when it sold for 20,460
Australian dollars (about U.S dlrs 12,600) at an auction Monday.
	   The price of the rare red topped the previous record of 18,000
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 11,000) _ also for a 1951 Grange _
set earlier this year, said auctioneer Stewart Langton, from
Langton's Fine Wine Auctions.
	   Langton would not reveal the buyer of the wine.
	   ``(The 1951 Grange) is a wine that's purchased for collection
rather than drinking,'' Langton added. ``That's not to say this one
won't be drunk, or that they're not, but most of them now are just
things to collect.
	   ``I've seen some '51s opened. I've seen one very, very good
bottle, one pretty good bottle and the rest were very tired.''
	   Langton said he was continually surprised by the prices
collectors paid for wines.
	   ``It's a lot of money but I have to say it is a very great
wine,'' he added. ``It was an excellent bottle of a very rare wine.
Grange is now an Australian icon nationally and internationally and
the '51 was the first of the breed so it's taken on historical
significance.''
	   The bottle went to a mystery bidder at the Wine Australia Shiraz
auction in Melbourne. Langton said it would remain in Australia as
part of a set of Grange.
	   Created by wine industry legend Max Schubert, the 1951 Grange
was the first vintage of what has become Australia's most famous
wine.
	   With fewer than 100 bottles left in the world, the 1951 is in
hot demand because it was never released. The first commercial
Grange was the 1952, which was released in 1955.
	   Grange is Australia's top investment wine, with current releases
selling for as much as Australian dlrs 400 (U.S. dlrs 250).

Jordan criticizes Syrian arrests of Jordanians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's foreign minister said Tuesday that
Syria is arbitrarily arresting and interrogating Jordanians and
demanded more information on 500 citizens who were either detained
or reported missing in Syria.
	   Foreign Minister Abdul-Illah Khatib said that if the arrests and
interrogations continue, Jordan will issue a travel advisory
warning ``our citizens to expect certain harassment and (bad)
treatment'' in Syria.
	   ``We don't accept that our citizens are detained on arrival at
Syrian entry points and we don't accept that they are investigated,
interrogated or asked to contact Syrian security departments,''
Khatib said.
	   He said two Jordanian engineers arrested at the border on Sunday
while en route to Lebanon were released a few hours later following
extensive contacts with the Syrian government.
	   ``They were freed on a condition that they go back to the same
security office to continue interrogation later,'' he said.
	   His remarks underline Jordan's growing frustration with
worsening relations with its northern neighbor. Ties chilled after
Amman signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
	   Syria says the treaty has weakened its bargaining position in
peace negotiations with Israel.
	   Khatib also demanded information on 500 Jordanians jailed
without trial or reported missing in Syria. Several are government
officials.
	   ``We need to know the exact case of each and every Jordanian,''
he said, adding that two recent meetings with top-ranking Syrian
officials were futile.
	   Syria has not admitted that it holds any Jordanian detainees.
	   Most of the detainees are believed to be either affiliated with
Marxist Palestinian groups or Jordan's fundamentalist Muslim
Brotherhood Movement.
	   Some are also believed to be members of the National Command of
Syria's ruling Baath Party who were detained following the coup
that brought President Hafez Assad to power in 1971.
	   Earlier this month, the families of Jordanians detained in Syria
held a peaceful demonstration in Amman to demand the release of
their relatives.
	   Khatib said his Egyptian counterpart, Amr Moussa, has offered to
mediate the dispute.
	   ``We welcomed that,'' he said. ``We have extended our hands to
our Syrian brethren and we hope that they will respond
positively.''

2 Rwandan genocide suspects end hunger strike

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Two of 25 Rwandan genocide suspects who
went on a hunger strike to protest what they called a United
Nations tribunal bias against them resumed eating 24 hours later, a
U.N. official said Tuesday.
	   Clement Kayishema and Obed Ruzindana, who are jointly charged
with killing of Tutsis in the Rwandan genocide of 1994, ate
breakfast, said the source on condition his name was not published.
	   Thirty genocide suspects and two convicts, who are appealing,
are detained by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in
the northern Tanzania town of Arusha.
	   ``I saw Kayishema taking some bites this morning at the ICTR
facility,'' said the source.
	   He said he had also been told by ICTR workers that Ruzindana had
breakfast.
	   A prison worker, who also spoke on condition his name was not
published, said some of the other detainees were ``secretly taking
biscuits and juices.''
	   The 25 suspects said Monday they were joining the hunger strike
of a convicted former mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu, who stopped eating
last week because the tribunal refused to pay for the Canadian
lawyer he wanted as a defense attorney.
	   The court gives suspects a choice of tribunal-appointed defense
attorneys free. Suspects may select non-tribunal attorneys but the
court will not pay for them.
	   In a letter Monday to the court the 25 suspects accused the
panel of bias, indifference to detainees' complaints and an
inability to ``understand defense arguments.''
	   Awe Okali, the tribunal's registrar, later defended the system
of court-appointed lawyers and said the detainees were panicking
because they realized the tribunal's work was moving forward.
	   ``The reality of the tribunal's work of calling to account
persons accused of genocide in Rwanda is hitting home,'' Okali
said. ``In these circumstances, these detainees feel they have
nothing to lose by engaging in these agitations.''
	   Akayesu is appealing the life sentence he received earlier this
month for his role in the genocide, which was orchestrated by the
Hutu-dominated government.
	   More than 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and politically moderate
Hutus, were killed between April and July 1994. The slaughter ended
when a Tutsi-dominated rebel force defeated the government army.

Electronics makers Toshiba, Hitachi announce losses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS last year's first half sales for Toshiba, graf 5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese electronics giant Toshiba Corp. posted
losses of more than dlrs 50 million in the first half of fiscal
1998 _ the company's first dip into the red in nearly 50 years, the
company said Tuesday.
	   Hitachi Ltd., the country's largest electronics maker, also
announced losses for the half-year ended Sept. 30.
	   Toshiba posted a 6.4 billion yen (dlrs 53.6 million) parent
pretax loss for the latest six months, against a 25.4 billion yen
(dlrs 212 million) profit in the same period last year.
	   Toshiba also had a 6.4 billion yen (dlrs 53.6 million) parent
net loss for the half-year after posting a 22.45 billion yen (dlrs
188 million) profit the previous year.
	   Toshiba's parent sales were down 12.3 percent to 1.60 trillion
yen (dlrs 13.4 billion) from 1.82 trillion yen (dlrs 15.2 billion)
the previous year.
	   The company blamed its poor results on a drop in semiconductor
prices and slow demand for computers and consumer electronics. It
said the Asian financial crisis had cut into demand for memory
chips.
	   It was the first time the company had recorded pretax losses
since 1950, said company spokesman Kazuyoshi Ishiyama.
	   Hitachi recorded a parent pretax loss of 69.2 billion yen (dlrs
580 million) for the half-year compared to profits of 33.3 billion
yen (dlrs 279 million) a year earlier.
	   The company recorded a parent net loss of 124.7 billion yen
(dlrs 1.04 billion) for the latest six months against a profit of
24.3 billion yen (dlrs 204 million) a year earlier.
	   Hitachi's parent sales were down 12 percent to 1.80 trillion yen
(dlrs 15.1 billion) from 2.05 trillion yen (dlrs 17.2 billion) the
previous year.
	   The company said the losses resulted from Japan's recession and
slumping semiconductor and consumer electronics sales.
	   Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Japan's largest
comprehensive heavy machinery maker, announced a sharp fall in
profits for the half-year.
	   Mitsubishi's parent pretax profits fell to 50.6 billion yen
(dlrs 424 million) from 74.31 billion yen (dlrs 622 million) a year
earlier.
	   Its parent net profit dropped to 29.29 billion yen (dlrs 245
million) from 43.3 billion yen (dlrs 363 million).
	   The company said orders fell as Japan's recession caused the
private sector to invest less in new factories and equipment.

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces scrambled Tuesday
to meet a NATO deadline for pulling back in Kosovo, and hundreds of
people returned to their homes here for the first time in months
now that most of the police and soldiers have gone.
	   Private radio station B-92 quoted Serb sources as saying the
withdrawal was complete and that government forces in Kosovo were
back to the level before Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched his crackdown against ethnic Albanian militants on Feb.
28.
	   International observers traveled through the majority Albanian
province Tuesday to try to verify those claims.
	   U.S. officials in Washington say the Clinton administration
wants verification before declaring that Milosevic satisfied the
terms of the deal he accepted to end the crisis.
	   ``We want to make sure the movements are a real withdrawal and
not a reconfiguration (of forces),'' White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said.
	   The 16-nation NATO alliance has threatened to launch airstrikes
unless Milosevic halts his crackdown and cuts his forces to levels
in place before the conflict began.
	   NATO ambassadors were to meet later Tuesday in Brussels,
Belgium, hours before the 1900 GMT deadline for Milosevic to
comply.
	   In Belgrade, the special U.S. mediator for Kosovo, Christopher
Hill, said that based on reports from the field, ``we are seeing
substantial movement'' but he stopped short of declaring the
withdrawal complete.
	   ``There is an effort to reconfigure the security forces in a way
that we truly hope will reduce the violence substantially,'' Hill
said. ``We also hope this reconfiguration, moving around of forces,
will help resolve the issue of the displaced... people who are
afraid to come back to their villages.''
	   That appeared to indicate that the United States was pushing
Milosevic not only to draw down his forces in the province but was
also dictating where the remaining troops could be stationed.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, the overseas spokesman of the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, Bardhyl Mahmuti, called the
Yugoslav troop movements nothing more than an ``illusion'' of
actual withdrawals. Ethnic Albanians had been urging NATO to strike
Serb forces to change the balance of power in the conflict.
	   Evidence of the Serb withdrawal Tuesday included the abandoned
Komorane checkpoint outside Pristina and signs of more movement
among villagers.
	   In Malisevo, a former rebel stronghold 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina, hundreds of ethnic Albanians filled the
streets on Tuesday morning, revisiting for the first time the homes
and shops they abandoned when Serb forces overran the town July 28.
	   Osman Mazreku said he fled to nearby Belanica village on July 28
with his wife, mother and three children. His father chose to
remain behind, was arrested by police and has not been seen since,
according to Mazreku.
	   ``He said `I'm old and they won't do anything to me,' '' Mazreku
said. ``I was afraid something like this would happen but he was
determined'' to stay.
	   The top floor of Mazreku's two-story house had been gutted by
fire, and clothing and garbage were strewn across the ground floor.
	   ``I'm sorry to see my house in this condition, but I'm happy to
be alive,'' he said. ``That's all that matters. I hope they'll let
me live here now.''
	   But no one planned to stay the night or bring their families
back until police vacated a building on edge of the village. As if
to underscore the uncertainty, the streets emptied after a short
burst of automatic rifle fire when a small convoy of armored police
vehicles arrived to reinforce the police presence at the building.
	   Serb police said the shots came from somewhere in the village
but they did not return the fire. About three kilometers (1.5
miles) north of the town, uniformed KLA guerrillas inspected
bunkers vacated by departing Serb police and found a grenade tied
to a tree with a trip wire set as a booby trap.
	   Such threats prevent most of remaining displaced people in
Kosovo from returning home. But many have come out of the
wilderness because of the approaching winter to stay with friends
and relatives in safe towns, said U.N. refugee official Kris
Janowski. He put the number of people still living in the woods at
about 10,000.
	   ``It's not an ideal situation but it's not a situation where
we'll see people starving or freezing to death,'' Janowski said.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and
most want independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 have been driven from
their homes in seven months of fighting since Milosevic launched
the crackdown.
	   As the withdrawal accelerated, Kosovo's Serb governor, Veljko
Odalovic, thanked the police for ``bringing peace to Kosovo'' and
pledged the province will be defended from ethnic Albanian
``terrorists'' with or without the police.

Palestinians arrest suspects in Jewish settler killing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian security forces arresting two
suspects in the killing of Jewish settler, Netanyahu quote; EDITS
to TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT ARBA, West Bank (AP) _ Making good on a promise of
renewed security cooperation with Israel, Palestinian agents on
Tuesday arrested two suspects in the killing of a Jewish settler, a
spokesman for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said.
	   The victim, 29-year-old security guard Danny Vargas from the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, was shot dead Monday in the town
of Hebron in an apparent attack by Palestinian militants.
	   Later Monday, a 65-year-old Palestinian man was bludgeoned to
death, and Israeli police reportedly were searching for a suspect,
a young Israeli man.
	   Vargas' killing and the slaying of Mohammed Zalout, apparently
by a Jewish extremist, tested the new Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement.
	   At Vargas' open grave, politicians and friends delivering
eulogies demanded Tuesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu go
back on his promise to withdraw from West Bank land.
	   ``You promised us peace and security, and we have neither,''
said legislator Rehavam Zeevi from the far-right opposition party
Moledet, referring to Netanyahu. His speech was punctuated by
shouts of ``wage war'' by some of the mourners.
	   A centerpiece of the agreement, which calls for an Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, is a pledge by the
Palestinians to work harder to rein in militants.
	   Demonstrating a new attitude, Palestinian security forces who
had suspended cooperation with Israel for most of the past 17
months arrested two suspects Tuesday in the Vargas killing.
	   Ahmed Tibi, a spokesman for Arafat, said the two men are
residents of Hebron, but Tibi did not say whether they had ties to
a Palestinian political faction. The two suspects also confessed to
killing a Jewish seminary student this month near the communal farm
of Ora south of Jerusalem, Tibi said.
	   Netanyahu condemned Monday's two slayings and said he was
determined to carry out the peace agreement _ despite violence and
opposition from Israeli hard-liners.
	   ``The only thing that can prevent the implementation of the
agreement is if the (Israeli) Cabinet does not approve it, or if
the Palestinians do not fulfill it,'' Netanyahu said.
	   The Cabinet was to convene Thursday, and the peace agreement was
expected to win narrow approval.
	   In troubled Hebron Israeli troops enforced a curfew on the
downtown area they control, barring some 30,000 Palestinians there
from leaving their homes. The army also sealed the city, and
Palestinians were not allowed to enter or leave.
	   The restrictions, coming after the settler killing, embittered
many Palestinians who had hoped that life would improve as a result
of the peace agreement.
	   ``We thought that we could now go to Gaza, but we cannot even
leave our homes,'' said Hebron resident Khalil Jaberi, 26,
referring to a provision in the accord for a new land route for
Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   In the northern West Bank, hundreds of Palestinians clashed with
Israeli troops near the Balata and Askar refugee camps to protest
Monday's killing of Zalout. Soldiers fired tear gas and rubber
bullets to disperse Palestinian stone throwers, and two
Palestinians were injured.
	   Meanwhile, Netanyahu tried to assure Jewish settlers that they
would be safe, saying that none of the 144 settlements would become
isolated enclaves as a result of the troop withdrawal and that the
main north-south highway would remain under full Israeli control.
	   Netanyahu also said the United States had promised to deliver
clarifications on the new Palestinian security plan by the end of
the week.
	   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Israel was also expecting the U.S. administration to make
statements bolstering Netanyahu's position, including his
opposition to a unilateral Palestinian declaration of statehood
after the autonomy period ends in May 1999.

Families of riot detainees demand release of relatives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Families of 179 people jailed
since an anti-government riot over the weekend stood outside a
police compound Tuesday, demanding the release of their relatives
and waving pictures of what they claimed was police brutality.
	   ``I have a 65-year-old father who was beaten up. He was praying.
He was harmless,'' said Jusri Jamal, whose father was one of
thousands inside a mosque Saturday when police showered the Muslim
house of worship with tear gas and water cannons.
	   Jusri and some 150 others waited outside Kuala Lumpur's Police
Training Center all day Tuesday. Police denied access to family
members and a team of 18 Legal Aid lawyers.
	   An officer behind gates of the training center said that
families would not be allowed to visit during investigations.
	   N. Surendran, one of the lawyers, said police planned to hold
the detainees for 11 more days without charges pending an
investigation. While meeting with a magistrate inside the police
compound, he and other lawyers said they caught a glimpse of a
group of detainees.
	   ``Many people had black eyes, there were signs of beatings,''
Surendran said, adding, ``We cannot confirm they came from
police.''
	   Family members, however, showed reporters that they said
documented police beatings.
	   One woman held a photo downloaded from the Internet showing a
woman she identified as her 38-year-old sister, being dragged by
the hair by a plainclothes officer at Saturday's riot.
	   Police said they arrested 268 people at the riot, where
thousands demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad and justice for his jailed former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The majority of those arrested have not yet been released.
	   Police had threatened to use the Internal Security Act against
those caught at pro-Anwar rallies. The act allows detention without
trial.
	   Street protests have multiplied since Mahathir fired Anwar as
deputy prime minister and finance minister on Sept. 2. Anwar faces
trial beginning Nov. 2 on charges of corruption and sexual
misconduct.
	   Saturday's was the first violent clash. Protesters hurled rocks
and bottles at police. Many of those arrested appeared to be
innocent bystanders, who were kicked and punched by police, then
dragged into nearby trucks.
	   ``I thought it was only in the movies, but it happens in real
life, in a so-called democratic society,'' Azman Ismail told
reporters.
	   He waved a photograph that he said he took of his brother
earlier Tuesday while he was being transported to the police
compound. The man appeared to have a bruised eye.
	   ``He is in bad shape, worse than Anwar,'' Azman said.
	   Anwar's case sparked international concern when he appeared in
court last month with a badly blackened eye and body bruises, which
he said came from police beatings.

Palestinian covenant issue still smoldering, threatens crisis

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Netanyahu spokesman in 14th graf.

 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ No sooner did Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators return home than a new wrangle developed over the PLO
covenant, a 30-year-old document that calls for armed struggle to
destroy the Zionist state.
	   It could be a show stopper, too. So far, the two sides cannot
agree on whether U.S. President Bill Clinton will host a peace
``festival'' in mid-December as Palestinians envision or oversee a
somber parliament session to renounce the PLO's violent past, as
Israel wants.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised his right-wing
constituents that he would get the Palestinians' highest body to
repeal the PLO's founding charter before handing over any land.
	   He contends that the 600-member Palestine National Council will
convene and, for all the world to see, officially cancel the
charter by the legally mandated two-thirds margin.
	   ``Not so,'' say Palestinian officials. Despite Netanyahu's
contention that the job was left undone, they maintain that the
parliament-in-exile already amended the charter by a vote of 504-54
at a meeting in Gaza City on April 24, 1996.
	   What will be held this time is a ``festival,'' said Nabil
Shaath, a member of Arafat's Cabinet and a senior negotiator.
	   ``It will be a popular demonstration to show support for the
peace process,'' Shaath told reporters in Gaza after returning
home.
	   Dignitaries from all governing bodies, including the PNC, will
attend the ceremony at which Clinton and Arafat will speak. Shaath
said the gathered officials will approve a letter from Arafat to
Clinton affirming that the Palestinians no longer advocate
revolutionary violence to take back land that is now part of
Israel.
	   At the heart of the debate is an argument over translation of a
single word.
	   The English text says that Arafat and the parliament speaker
will ``invite'' members of the PNC. The Hebrew version, however,
says to ``convene'' a meeting.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said the English version
of the text was the ``authoritative'' one and that there were no
other official versions.
	   Right-wing opponents of the Wye Summit accord see the murkiness
of the wording as an attempt to beguile.
	   Michael Kleiner, a right-wing member of parliament, said
Netanyahu's claim that the PNC would meet was ``a bluff, a lie, and
sand in the eyes.'' He said the convening of various Palestinian
groups would have no legal standing.
	   Returning from the summit, Netanyahu told a news conference that
there was ``no clouding'' of the issue, adding that ``all of the
PNC will be present or at least invited.''
	   David Bar-Illan, a top Netanyahu aide, said Israel would ``draw
conclusions'' from the way the Palestinians treat the issue and
said a serious declaration in Arabic would have an important
educational and psychological impact.
	   ``We can't allow it to become a farce or a denial of a clear
commitment to reject the covenant in no uncertain terms,'' he told
The Associated Press.

Searching for cash, Russia expects record oil exports this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with figures on exports in 5th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia expects record exports this year of crude
oil, its top foreign-currency earner, despite pledges to cut sales
to help stop the slide in world prices, an official said Tuesday.
	   The reason for pushing exports ``is clear _ the lack of any
other sources of cash,'' said Energy Minister Sergei Generalov.
	   Russia last year experienced its first economic growth since the
Soviet collapse, but hopes for more of the same were dashed when a
new economic crisis erupted in mid-August. The government's chronic
cash-flow problems have grown even worse.
	   Generalov said Russia exported ``substantially more crude oil
than ever before'' in the first half of 1998.
	   Exports for the second half will be slightly lower, but overall,
``this year will in fact be a record high'' he told a news
conference. Russian news agencies said 1998 exports will total 115
million to 116 million metric tons (805 million to 811 million
barrels).
	   However, because world oil prices are quite low at present _
about dlrs 14 a barrel _ the government is unlikely to see a large
increase in revenues.
	   Russia promised the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries earlier this year that it would cut oil exports, because
surplus oil on world markets has kept prices low.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the chairman of a state-controlled bank
involved with debts said Russia will be able to make all payments
on its foreign debt this year.
	   Russia will have to pay about dlrs 3 billion toward its foreign
debt this year and about dlrs 18 billion next year, said Andrei
Kostin, chairman of the Vneshekonombank, or Bank of Foreign
Economic Activity.
	   ``If the government decides it cannot make foreign debt payments
next year, it should say so in advance,'' Kostin said, according to
the Interfax news agency. ``There is no question of nonpayments at
present.''
	   The head of the Russian parliament's budget committee, Alexander
Zhukov, said Monday the government will owe dlrs 17.5 billion in
foreign debt in 1999, but won't have the revenues to pay it.
	   Russia is trying to restructure its domestic debt, payments on
which were frozen when the financial crisis erupted in mid-August.
	   International lenders and debtors have been concerned about the
lack of a plan to boost revenues and slash spending, six weeks
after Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov took office.
	   The International Monetary Fund has said it wants to see a sound
economic plan implemented before releasing more of a dlrs 22.6
billion bailout package negotiated during the summer.
	   Meanwhile, the Federal Treasury said that privatizations netted
the government only 11 percent of the revenue it expected between
January and September _ 1.4 billion rubles (dlrs 79 million)
instead of 11.9 billion rubles (dlrs 698 million).
	   A number of big auctions have been canceled because of the
economic crisis.

Cambodian ruling party defends Hun Sen's record against U.S.
</HEADLINE>
congress &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's ruling party responded
Tuesday to criticisms of its leader in the U.S. Congress with a
lengthy defense of strongman Hun Sen's human rights record.
	   The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding resolution
passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives
calling for an investigation into violations of international
humanitarian law allegedly committed by Hun Sen.
	   Events mentioned in the resolution include Hun Sen's coup last
year against his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and
his violent crackdown in September against anti-government
demonstrations.
	   A copy of the resolution has since been submitted to the U.S.
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.
	   ``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to
wisely and realistically consider this draft resolution and give
justice to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not
approving it,'' the party said in a statement.
	   It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh as a proper response
to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate the defections of
senior Khmer Rouge rebels. It also repeated claims that the
prince's party had moved rebel soldiers into Phnom Penh, a
contention that remains unproved.
	   The killings of nearly 100 of Ranariddh's supporters documented
by U.N. human rights workers in the aftermath of the coup were
dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications meant to distort the
political situation.
	   Ranariddh and his core supporters did not return to Cambodia
until a few months before an election in July this year that the
ruling party narrowly won.
	   Ranariddh and his opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, refused to accept
the election results, alleging widespread intimidation and fraud by
the CPP. When their claims were dismissed by a Hun Sen-friendly
court, they rallied their supporters into the streets of Phnom
Penh.
	   After two weeks of tolerating the demonstrations, Hun Sen
ordered a violent crackdown that resulted in the deaths of at least
four protesters.
	   U.N. human rights workers later discovered more than 20 bodies _
many bearing signs of torture _ in and around the capital,
prompting speculation that the death toll could be much higher.
	   The ruling party supported the police action in its statement,
noting that public property was damaged by protesters and that
grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested
in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at
Hun Sen.
	   The opposition claims the grenade attack was staged as an excuse
to begin the crackdown.
	   ``The leaders of illegal demonstrations are the ones who must
bear responsibility for the consequences deriving from the
protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly violence
as ``minor incidents.''
	   The ruling party also reminded the United States that Washington
supported a Cambodian exile government dominated by the brutal
Khmer Rouge in the 1980s.
	   The Khmer Rouge was responsible for the deaths of as many as 2
million people during the guerrilla group's 1975-79 rule of
Cambodia.
	   After a series of border clashes, the Khmer Rouge was ousted
from power by an invading Vietnamese army that set up a surrogate
Cambodian communist government later led by Hun Sen.
	   The ruling party accused U.S. policy-makers of not taking timely
action to save the Cambodian people from the Khmer Rouge.
	   ``They must not make unjust accusations against those who led
the struggle to liberate the people from genocide,'' it added.

Islamic court chairman kidnapped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen kidnapped a
chairman of an Islamic court on his way to the mosque for morning
prayers in southern Mogadishu, witnesses said Tuesday.
	   Also Tuesday another unidentified group detonated an explosive
devise outside a court of a joint administration recently
established by faction leaders.
	   Sheik Omar Maalim Nur, chairman of Shirklole Islamic Court
affiliated with the administration, was ordered to board a pickup
truck by the gunmen, neighbors said.
	   They said the gunmen, who did not fire a shot, then sped in the
direction of the Bermuda Triangle, a dangerous central Mogadishu
neighborhood.
	   Soon after the kidnapping became known court officials were seen
preparing trucks mounted with weapons and militiamen to attempt a
rescue.
	   The Shirklole court has in recent months handed stiff sentences
to gunmen for robberies and the Nur's kidnappers are believed to
aim at avenging convicted colleagues.
	   There were no casualties reported in the explosion, which was
heard downtown Mogadishu, but the blast shuttered window panes.
	   About five males in a pick-up truck planted the explosive devise
outside the court and fled as the exchanged shots with militiamen
on guard.
	   No injuries on either side were reported.
	   No group had yet claimed responsibility for the kidnapping or
the blast.
	   Somalia has had no functioning central government since the 1991
ouster of the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and the country's
disintegration into fiefs protected by militias.

Two Rwandan genocide suspects end hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Two of 25 Rwandan genocide suspects who
went on a hunger strike to protest what they called bias by a U.N.
human rights tribunal resumed eating 24 hours later, a U.N.
official said Tuesday.
	   Thirty genocide suspects and two others appealing their
convictions are being held by the International Criminal Tribunal
for Rwanda in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
	   Clement Kayishema and Obed Ruzindana, who are jointly charged
with killing of Tutsis in the Rwandan genocide of 1994, ate
breakfast, said the source on condition his name was not published.
	   He said he had also been told by ICTR workers that Ruzindana had
breakfast.
	   A prison worker, who also spoke on condition his name not be
published, said some of the other detainees were ``secretly taking
biscuits and juices.''
	   The 25 suspects said Monday they were joining the hunger strike
of a convicted former mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu, who stopped eating
last week because the tribunal refused to pay for the Canadian
lawyer he wanted as a defense attorney.
	   The court gives suspects a choice of free tribunal-appointed
defense attorneys. Suspects may select other attorneys but the
court will not pay for them.
	   In a letter Monday to the court the 25 suspects accused the
panel of bias, indifference to detainees' complaints and an
inability to ``understand defense arguments.''
	   Awe Okali, the tribunal's registrar, later defended the system
of court-appointed lawyers and said the detainees were panicking
because they realized the tribunal's work was moving forward.
	   ``The reality of the tribunal's work of calling to account
persons accused of genocide in Rwanda is hitting home,'' Okali
said. ``In these circumstances, these detainees feel they have
nothing to lose by engaging in these agitations.''
	   Akayesu is appealing the life sentence he received earlier this
month for his role in the genocide, which was orchestrated by the
Hutu-dominated government.
	   More than 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and politically moderate
Hutus, were killed between April and July 1994. The slaughter ended
when a Tutsi-dominated rebel force defeated the government army.

British American Racing names Ricardo Zonta second driver
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British American Racing signed Brazil's Ricardo
Zonta on Tuesday to drive for the new Formula One team next season,
joining 1997 world champion Jacques Villeneuve.
	   The 22-year-old Zonta won the FIA Formula 3000 International
series in 1997 and the 1998 FIA Grand Touring Car Championship.
	   Craig Pollock, managing director of F-1's newest team, said
Zonta ``has shown the talent and maturity of a driver of far more
experience.''
	   Zonta, who is expected to join the team for December testing,
has also been a test driver for McLaren Mercedes.
	   ``I am thrilled to be driving alongside such a successful and
experienced driver as Jacques Villeneuve, from whom I am certain I
will learn a great deal,'' Zonta said.
	   Villeneuve, the defending series champion, announced in July he
was moving from Williams to British American Racing to team with
old friend Pollock.
	   BAR was set up last year as a joint venture of British American
Tobacco, Reynard Racing Cars and Pollock, with 50 percent of the
team owned by the tobacco giant. BAT is reported investing about
200 million pounds (dlrs 336 million) in the team.
	   BAR also bought out Tyrrell Racing, which will run its final
race Sunday in the Japanese Grand Prix. Tyrrell, used this season
as BAR's laboratory, won 33 F-1 races and season drivers'
championships in 1969, 1971 and 1973. It also won the constructors'
title in 1971.

Police identify Berlin subway kidnapper as Algerian refugee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A man who held a 3-year-old boy at knife point for
six hours in a Berlin train station was identified by police
Tuesday as a 25-year-old Algerian who had applied for asylum in
Germany.
	   The hostage-taker, whose name was not released, was arrested
Monday night after being overpowered by police. He was to be
arraigned Tuesday.
	   Police said he arrived in Germany on Sept. 9 and applied for
asylum in eastern Brandenburg state on Sept. 15. The application
was automatically denied after he failed to show up for a hearing.
The man then disappeared from the refugee home in Senftenberg where
he had been placed, showing up early this month in Berlin without a
residency permit.
	   Detective Hans-Ulrich Voss said the asylum rejection may have
prompted the kidnapping.
	   The traumatized boy remained under observation in a hospital
Tuesday, although a cut lip was his only physical injury.
	   He was snatched from his mother on Monday by the kidnapper, who
threatened to slash the boy's throat. The kidnapper demanded a
plane ticket, then money, which he threw away after it was given to
him. At one point he also demanded an imprisoned member of the
Algerian Islamic Salvation Front be freed in Algeria, police said.

Schroeder takes office as German chancellor

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with poll on Schroeder's authority, new quote,
background on Schroeder &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat who
defeated Chancellor Helmut Kohl in elections last month on promises
to modernize Germany after 16 years of conservative rule, was
confirmed as Germany's seventh postwar chancellor Tuesday.
	   Though the vote was expected, Schroeder clearly savored the
moment, smiling slowly then standing to embrace Social Democratic
party leader Oskar Lafontaine after the new parliament's president
announced the results: 351 in favor, 287 against with 27
abstentions.
	   Schroeder acknowledged the vote, stating simply, ``I accept the
election.''
	   Schroeder, 54, will lead Germany into the 21st century and
through some critical changes, including the government's move to
Berlin and the adoption of the single European currency to replace
the German mark. He was to be sworn in later Tuesday.
	   Parliament president Wolfgang Thierse wished Schroeder
``strength and much success for our country.''
	   Kohl, who was relieved of office Monday, waited until after the
vote was confirmed to shake Schroeder's hand, showing no emotion as
he turned away. Other members of Kohl's Cabinet followed his lead.
	   The parliament later was to confirm Schroeder's Cabinet
ministers, and he was to convene the first Cabinet meeting by
evening.
	   Schroeder and his coalition partner, the environmentalist Greens
party, are pledging to put Germans back to work, make it easier for
foreign residents to get citizenship and move toward shutting down
nuclear power plants. Continuity is the byword in foreign policy.
	   Welcoming Schroeder to office, President Roman Herzog stressed
that Schroeder is under pressure to keep Germany competitive.
``Germany needs reforms ... The world is not waiting for us,''
Herzog said.
	   Schroeder's pro-market reputation helped him win ``New Center''
voters who previously mistrusted the left. But since his triumph in
the Sept. 27 election, he has stressed his party's plans to
strengthen the social welfare state, and his commitment to the free
market was called into question after a computer entrepreneur he
tapped as a Cabinet member backed out.
	   Schroeder's defining feature has been his ability to project a
broad appeal by refusing to be pinned down, promising simply a
``new beginning'' for Germany. Within days of announcing the new
government's plans for a tax cut to relieve average earners,
Schroeder responded to harsh criticism from German industry by
saying he was open to changes in the formula.
	   One of Schroeder's main challenges will be balancing his
pro-business stands with the party's more traditional leftist
social welfare roots.
	   For now, Germans aren't sure, though, that Schroeder is really
in charge.
	   About 43 percent of 1,003 Germans questioned in a poll said they
believe Social Democrat party leader Oskar Lafontaine, who also is
the new finance minister, will be making decisions with Schroeder.
	   Lafontaine, an old-style leftist, has been more enthusiastic
about government intervention in the economy than Schroeder. But he
has denied a power struggle and pledged to respect Schroeder's
authority.
	   ``It's not my reputation to show too little authority in making
decisions,'' Schroeder once remarked.
	   The new government enjoys a 21-seat majority in the lower house,
which is elected for four years. The Greens are governing Germany
for the first time and will be running the foreign ministry, one of
three Cabinet posts for the junior partner.

Iran to start major war games on Afghanistan border next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran said Tuesday it will stage major
military exercises on its border with Afghanistan next week, depite
an easing of tensions with its neighbor.
	   About 200,000 troops from the Iranian army, air force and navy
will take part in the war games, the commander of ground forces,
Brig. Gen. Abdolali Pourshasd, was quoted as saying by state-run
Tehran radio.
	   The naval drills will take place on Lake Hamoon, which lies on
the border of Iran and Afghanistan.
	   The maneuvers, code-named Zolfaqar, were set to start last month
but have been postponed several times. No reason was given.
	   Tensions rose sharply last month after the Taliban militia,
which controls most of Afghanistan, admitted that its forces had
killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in the northern
city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   But the situation improved this month after the intervention of
U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who secured the release of 26
Iranians held captive in Afghanistan.
	   Brahimi also procured a promise from the Taliban to hold
face-to-face talks with Iran.

	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ A leader of a Palestinian militant group
narrowly escaped death Tuesday when he pulled his family away from
his booby-trapped car seconds before it exploded, witnesses said.
	   The car bombing wounded Mahmoud Majzoub, his wife Noha, their
9-month-old son Hussein and a Syrian passer-by, security officials
said.
	   They were admitted to a hospital with burns, bruises, broken
bones and wounds from bits of the blasted car. Officials at Hammoud
Hospital said the victims were in a ``stable'' condition, but the
boy _ whose age was earlier given as 4 _ was in intensive care for
observation.
	   The 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) blast also shattered windows of nearby
shops and damaged cars on a main road in east Sidon, 45 kilometers
(27 miles) south of Beirut.
	   Police set up checkpoints around Sidon in a bid to catch the
perpetrators. Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul canceled all arms
permits in the city, the capital of southern Lebanon.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attempted
assassination. The Lebanese leader of Islamic Jihad, the group to
which Majzoub belongs, blamed Israel.
	   ``The Zionist enemy is fully responsible,'' Abu Imad Rifai told
a news conference in Sidon. Referring to the Israeli-Palestinian
agreement signed in Washington on Friday, he said the bombing was
``a fruit of the agreements of humiliation and submission.''
	   In Jerusalem, Israeli military officials had no immediate
comment.
	   Witnesses told The Associated Press that Majzoub, 31, noticed
something was wrong as he was about to start his car outside his
house. He told his wife to grab the child, get out and run for
cover.
	   They were only meters (yards) away when the Volvo sedan
exploded, witnesses said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Rifai said somebody had triggered the alarm on Majzoub's car
during the night. When Majzoub got into the vehicle in the morning,
he heard a noise underneath the car.
	   Explosives experts at the scene estimated the bomb to have been
made of 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) of TNT high explosive.
	   Majzoub is a senior member of Jihad in Sidon. He was born in the
city but, like some Lebanese, joined the Palestinian group which is
staunchly opposed to peace with Israel.
	   The group held a rally Sunday in Ein El-Hilweh, the large
Palestinian refugee camp outside Sidon, to mark the third
anniversary of the assassination of its leader, Fathi Shekaki.
Shekaki was gunned down outside a hotel in Malta in 1995 in a hit
widely blamed on Israeli agents.
	   Sidon has seen a spate of shootings in the past three months in
which the victims were often liquor store owners. On Saturday, two
policemen were shot dead by a gunman on a motorbike. Security
officials believe Muslim fundamentalist groups, seeking a ban on
alcohol, could be behind the attacks.

French bosses choose more employee-friendly name for their group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French bosses, represented by the National Council
of French Employers, seeking to spiffy up their image, came up with
a more people-friendly name on Tuesday: the Movement of French
Enterprises.
	   ``We went to the grassroots of companies to find out their
ambitions, their feelings,'' said the head of the organization,
Ernest Antoine Seilliere, announcing the name change.
	   ``We got the feeling they wanted to contribute to society's
economic and social progress, and contribute fully.''
	   Selliere added that the word ``movement'' is in keeping with the
slogan of the bosses' organization: ``Enterprises ahead.''
	   But it is no secret that the CNPF -- now known for short as
MEDEF -- was also looking to update, and soften, its tough image.
	   ``The word `boss' is just a little obsolete,'' said Georges
Jolles, who heads MEDEF's Social Commission.
	   The question now is whether the French press will change its
nickname for Selliere, known as the ``boss of bosses.''

Serb forces redeploy in Kosovo as NATO deadline nears

<TEXT>
	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces scrambled Tuesday
to meet a NATO deadline for pulling back in Kosovo, and hundreds of
ethnic Albanian refugees began returning to their homes for the
first time in months.
	   The private radio station B-92 quoted Serb sources Tuesday as
saying the withdrawal was complete. International observers were
out in force in the majority ethnic Albanian province to verify
those claims.
	   U.S. officials in Washington said the Clinton administration
wanted to make sure the pullback was genuine before declaring that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had satisfied the terms of
the deal he accepted to end the crisis over Kosovo.
	   ``We want to make sure the movements are a real withdrawal,''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
	   Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 have been driven from
their homes in fighting since Milosevic launched a crackdown in
late February against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and
most want independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The 16-nation NATO alliance has threatened to launch airstrikes
unless Milosevic halts his crackdown and cuts his forces to levels
in place before the conflict began.
	   NATO ambassadors were to meet Tuesday in Brussels, Belgium,
prior to the 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) deadline for Milosevic to
comply.
	   In Belgrade, the special U.S. mediator for Kosovo, Christopher
Hill, said ``we are seeing substantial movement'' but he stopped
short of declaring the withdrawal complete.
	   ``There is an effort to reconfigure the security forces in a way
that we truly hope will reduce the violence substantially,'' Hill
said. ``We also hope this reconfiguration, moving around of forces,
will help resolve the issue of the displaced... people who are
afraid to come back to their villages.''
	   That appeared to indicate that the United States was pushing
Milosevic not only to draw down his forces in the province but was
also dictating where the remaining troops could be stationed.
	   In Geneva, the overseas spokesman of the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army, Bardhyl Mahmuti, called the Yugoslav troop
movements nothing more than an ``illusion'' of actual withdrawals.
Ethnic Albanians had been urging NATO to strike Serb forces to
change the balance of power in the conflict.
	   Evidence of the Serb withdrawal Tuesday included the abandoned
Komorane checkpoint outside Pristina and signs of more movement
among villagers.
	   In this former rebel stronghold 30 miles (50 kilometers)
southwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital, hundreds of ethnic
Albanians swarmed the streets, visiting homes and shops they
abandoned when Serb forces overran the town in July.
	   As if to underscore the uncertainty of the situation, the crowds
disappeared after a few bursts of automatic gunfire rang out as a
military convoy rolled through headed toward Pristina.
	   Serb police said the shots came from somewhere in the village
and that they did not return fire. Just north of the town, a few
Kosovo Liberation Army rebels inspected bunkers vacated by
departing Serb police and found a grenade tied to a tree with a
trip wire set as a booby trap.
	   Such threats prevent most of remaining displaced people in
Kosovo from returning home.
	   But many have come out of the wilderness because of the
approaching winter to stay with friends and relatives in safe
towns, said U.N. refugee official Kris Janowski. He put the number
of people still living in the woods at about 10,000.
	   ``It's not an ideal situation but it's not a situation where
we'll see people starving or freezing to death,'' Janowski said.
	   In Malisevo, one of the townspeople, Osman Mazreku, said he fled
to a nearby village nearly three months ago with his wife, mother
and three children. His elderly father chose to remain behind. He
was arrested by police and has not been seen since, Osman said.
	   ``He said 'I'm old and they won't do anything to me,''' Osman
said. ``I was afraid something like this would happen.''
	   The top floor of Osman's two-story house had been gutted by
flames. Clothing, valuables and garbage were strewn across the
ground floor.
	   ``I'm sorry to see my house in this condition, but I'm happy to
be alive,'' he said. ``That's all that matters. I hope they'll let
me live here.''
	   As the withdrawal accelerated, Kosovo's Serb governor, Veljko
Odalovic, thanked the police for ``bringing peace to Kosovo'' and
pledged the province will be defended from ethnic Albanian
``terrorists'' with or without the police.
	   On Monday, tanks withdrew from roadside positions in the central
Drenica area where they had dug in since Oct. 18. At another
checkpoint, in Dragobilje, which was occupied by heavily armed Serb
police a few days earlier, a uniformed ethnic Albanian guerrilla
stood holding an automatic rifle.

Two Rwandan genocide suspects end hunger strike

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Two of 25 Rwandan genocide suspects who
went on a hunger strike to protest what they called bias by a U.N.
human rights tribunal resumed eating 24 hours later, a U.N.
official said Tuesday.
	   Thirty genocide suspects and two others appealing their
convictions are being held by the International Criminal Tribunal
for Rwanda, prosecuting suspects who killed more than 500,000
people, mostly Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus, between April
and July 1994.
	   Clement Kayishema and Obed Ruzindana, who are jointly charged
with killing of Tutsis in the genocide, ate breakfast, said the
source on condition his name was not published.
	   He said workers for the tribunal, which is meeting in the
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, said Ruzindana had breakfast.
	   A prison worker, who also spoke on condition his name not be
published, said some of the other detainees were ``secretly taking
biscuits and juices.''
	   The 25 suspects said Monday they were joining the hunger strike
of a convicted former mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu, who stopped eating
last week because the tribunal refused to pay for the Canadian
lawyer he wanted as a defense attorney.
	   The court gives suspects a choice of free tribunal-appointed
defense attorneys. Suspects may select other attorneys but the
court will not pay for them.
	   In a letter Monday to the court the 25 suspects accused the
panel of bias, indifference to detainees' complaints and an
inability to ``understand defense arguments.''
	   Awe Okali, the tribunal's registrar, later defended the system
of court-appointed lawyers and said the detainees were panicking
because they realized the tribunal's work was moving forward.
	   ``The reality of the tribunal's work of calling to account
persons accused of genocide in Rwanda is hitting home,'' Okali
said. ``In these circumstances, these detainees feel they have
nothing to lose by engaging in these agitations.''
	   Akayesu is appealing the life sentence he received earlier this
month for his role in the genocide, which was orchestrated by the
Hutu-dominated government.
	   The slaughter ended when a Tutsi-dominated rebel force defeated
the government army.

	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ The successor to Germany's new
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder suffered minor injuries Tuesday when
the car he was in crashed into an embankment at 150 kilometers per
hour (90 mph).
	   Gerhard Glogowski, who is to take over from Schroeder as Lower
Saxony state governor on Wednesday, was headed to Bonn in an
armored Audi A8 driven by his chauffeur when another car pulled in
front of them in the left lane, forcing them to swerve right, his
office said.
	   The Audi was badly damaged when it plowed into the embankment on
the highspeed autobahn at Olper, just west of Cologne. Glogowski
and his driver both received light injuries, mostly bruises, his
office said.
	   Glogowski, who was going to witness the vote and swearing in
ceremony of his friend Schroeder, switched to an accompanying car
for the remainder of the trip, saying he would wait to see a doctor
there, his office said in a statement.

Palestinians say they will boycott Jerusalem elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM, (AP) _ The Palestinian Authority on Tuesday urged
Palestinians to boycott next month's elections for mayor in
Jerusalem, saying participation would signal acceptance of Israeli
rule over all of the disputed city.
	   The status of Jerusalem is to be determined in talks on a
permanent Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement that have yet to
begin.
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, the sector Israel
captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war, as their capital.
However, Israel says it will never relinquish control over all of
the city which is sacred to Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
	   Faisal Husseini, the leading official of Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority in Jerusalem, told a news conference Tuesday
that the city's Palestinian residents should stay home on Nov. 10
when municipal elections are being held in Jerusalem.
	   ``We hope they will not participate,'' Husseini said.
	   Jerusalem has about 420,000 Jewish and 180,000 Palestinian
residents. Some 124,000 Palestinians are eligible to vote, said an
Israeli legislator, Naomi Hazan.
	   Husseini was expressing the traditional Palestinian view. The
PLO has always discouraged Palestinian residents of the city from
participating in the elections, saying this would be tantamount to
recognizing Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem.
	   However, some are taking a more pragmatic view.
	   Jonathan Kuttab, a Palestinian human rights lawyer, said that
although Palestinians may not necessarily get a share of power if
they vote and post candidates, they will become more informed on
issues involving them directly, as the budget and services.
	   As a result of the Palestinians' refusal to vote, they have
received very little in services in return for the taxes they pay.
Many roads in east Jerusalem are full of potholes and classrooms
are overcrowded.
	   Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, a hardliner in Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, is expected to be re-elected.

Hamas to continue war with Israel, says leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A leader of the radical Palestinian group
Hamas was quoted Tuesday as saying that his movement will continue
fighting Israel despite its peace accord with Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.
	   Khalid Mashaal, the head of the Hamas' political bureau, also
predicted that the Palestinian Authority will not be able to
fulfill its pledges to destroy extremist groups under the new
Middle East deal.
	   ``We will not be a scapegoat ... we are not weak nor can we be
easily broken,'' Mashaal was quoted as saying in an interview with
the Islamic-oriented Al-Shaab newspaper.
	   ``No one can destroy Hamas or end its role. Our battle will be
with the Zionist enemy and our people will be our wall of
protection,'' Mashaal, who is based in Jordan, said.
	   Hamas is opposed to any peace deal with Israel and advocates the
annihilation of Israel. It has been blamed for several fatal
attacks on Israelis in the past.
	   Under the accord signed in Washington on Friday by the Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, the authority has agreed to track down Palestinian radicals
blamed for attacks on Israelis. The CIA would keep track of the
efforts to arrest and punish these elements as a way of alleviating
Israeli security concerns.
	   Mashaal was quoted as saying that the implementation of the
agreement will inevitably spark a confrontation with the
Palestinian security forces.
	   He also blasted the task assigned to the CIA in the agreement,
saying that will make the American intelligence service a partner
`` in suppressing the Palestinian people.''
	   Mashaal said the CIA has in the past investigated Hamas members
in cooperation with the Palestinian security.

Kosovo rebels confirm Serb troop withdrawal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A representative of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army confirmed Tuesday the withdrawal of Serb troops in
the troubled province, but also expressed skepticism about its
sincerity.
	   As government forces scrambled to meet a 1900 GMT NATO deadline
for pulling back in Kosovo, KLA's political representative Adem
Demaci confirmed the withdrawal.
	   ``We have confirmation that the Serb forces are withdrawing and
that a lot of checkpoints were removed,'' Demaci said. But he
expressed doubts about the long-term impact it could have.
	   ``I don't know how serious this withdrawal is in a long run,''
he said.
	   There are widespread fears that the KLA _ that has been fighting
to secede Kosovo from Serbia, but has largely been beaten by much
better armed government troops _ would take advantage of the Serb
withdrawal to impose its authority throughout the province.
	   ``KLA is not in the situation to take the advantage, because it
is on its own terrain, in its own house,'' Demaci sarcastically
told reporters. ``If the Serb forces are withdrawing, this doesn't
mean that KLA has to leave Kosovo as well.''
	   Demaci promised the KLA will stick to its cease-fire proclaimed
last month and added there will be no ``revenge'' against Serbs
still living in Kosovo.

Media magnate opposition leader Berlusconi on trial again on

corruption charges &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian media magnate and opposition leader
Silvio Berlusconi, convicted three times this year in corruption
cases, went on trial again Tuesday.
	   He is charged with false bookkeeping to conceal dlrs 6 million
in illegal contributions in 1991 to the Socialist Party of
then-Premier Bettino Craxi.
	   Berlusconi, himself an ex-premier and now leader of Italy's
conservative opposition, has already been convicted in a separate
trial of making the contributions. He was fined dlrs 5.6 million
and sentenced to 28 months in prison in July.
	   Also in July, Berlusconi was convicted of bribing tax inspectors
and sentenced to 33 months. In December, he was convicted of fraud
in a film company deal and given a suspended sentence of 16 months.
	   All three convictions are on appeal.
	   The charges in the new trial are linked to the Craxi
contributions and center on an alleged attempt to cover up the
contributions, which were made to Craxi's holding company, All
Iberian.
	   Berlusconi, who served as premier for seven months in 1994, has
consistently denied wrongdoing in all the cases against him and
portrayed himself as the target of a political vendetta by leftist
prosecutors.

Rockets said to have killed pro-Israeli militaman in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas fired rockets into the
Israeli-occupied zone of southern Lebanon on Tuesday, killing an
Israeli-allied militiaman, Lebanese security officials said.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group said its fighters had
attacked with rockets the Jabal Hmayyed hilltop post of the South
Lebanon Army militia, eight kilometers (five miles) north of the
Israeli border and 12 kilometers (seven miles) southeast of the
port of Tyre.
	   Lebanese officials said an SLA militiaman was killed. There was
no immediate confirmation from Israel.
	   In retaliation, Israeli and SLA gunners opened fire on suspected
guerrilla hideouts north of the occupied zone, officials said.
There was no immediate word of casualties from the retaliatory
shelling.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is fighting to oust some 1,500
Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the zone that Israeli
set up in 1985 to protect its northern towns against cross-border
guerrilla raids.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Basque party that won weekend regional
elections is considering a coalition government that would include
a group linked to the armed ETA commandos who declared a cease-fire
five weeks before ballots were cast.
	   With the cease-fire still intact, Basque Nationalist Party
leader Xabier Arzalluz said Tuesday a coalition was being explored
with other parties that favor independence from Spain.
	   He said the Nationalists Party, which won 21 seats in the
75-seat regional legislature, might offer a pact with Euskal
Alkartasuna, which has six seats, and rely on outside support from
Euskal Herritarrok, a political group allied with ETA.
	   Euskal Herritarrok, which won 14 seats, is a coalition dominated
by Herri Batasuna, long recognized as the political wing of ETA.
The coalition has said it will not form part of a new government,
but could lend support on certain votes.
	   The vote Sunday was the sixth Basque regional election and the
first to held without the threat of violence following the Sept. 18
truce by ETA, which has killed nearly 800 people in its 30-year
campaign for independence.
	   The truce resulted from months of talks between Arzalluz's party
and Herri Batasuna.
	   A regional coalition made up entirely of pro-independence
parties would be the first of its kind in the Basque region since
it was given autonomous powers in 1979 following the death of
dictator Francisco Franco.
	   It would exclude the country's two main parties, steadfast in
their opposition to a split in Spanish unity: Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar's ruling center-right Popular Party and the opposition
Socialists.
	   The Popular Party placed second in the election with 16 seats,
while the Socialists took 14.
	   Arzalluz said no avenues had been closed with any party. Aznar's
Popular Party and the Socialists have strongly criticized the
Basque Nationalist Party's dealings with Herri Batasuna.
	   Both Aznar and the Socialist leaders insist Herri Batasuna and
ETA must renounce the armed campaign. Six Popular Party members
have been killed by ETA over the last three years.
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the Basque
language, has remained silent since the elections, but has said its
truce was ``solid and serious.''
	   The fact the elections resulted in no clear winner demonstrates
how deeply divided the northern region is over independence, truce
or no truce.
	   Voters gave three separatist parties a total of 41 seats and
four parties opposed to breaking up Spain 34 seats. More than 70
percent of registered voters turned out, the highest of any Basque
election.
	   The big winners were the two parties farthest apart
ideologically--the Popular Party, which gained six new seats, and
Euskal Herritarrok which added three.
	   The moderate Basque Nationalist Party, which has topped every
one of the region's elections, dropped only one seat and qualified
to form the government.

Communists reiterate call for Yeltsin's ouster
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Yeltsin &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Communists renewed their call for Boris
Yeltsin's resignation Tuesday, saying the Kremlin is ``mocking the
nation and common sense'' by claiming the president is healthy.
	   Yeltsin canceled yet another foreign trip Monday, a one-day
visit to Austria, this time because of extreme fatigue.
	   ``Yeltsin's inability to work has been obvious to us for quite a
long time,'' Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov told a news
conference Tuesday.
	   ``Mr. Yeltsin's illness is incurable. He is suffering from
irresponsibility and inability to fulfill his obligations,''
Zyuganov said. ``He is a man without conscience, and, in effect, a
drunkard.''
	   Yeltsin's opponents long have accused the president of heavy
drinking _ claims he has denied.
	   The Kremlin is ``mocking the nation and common sense'' by saying
Yeltsin was generally healthy despite his recurring illnesses,
Zyuganov said.
	   Zyuganov called for Yeltsin to undergo an independent medical
exam and for the results to be made public.
	   Zyuganov, who finished second in the 1996 presidential election,
is considered a leading potential contender in the next race. He
wouldn't comment Tuesday on whether he will run, saying it's up to
the Communist Party to decide.
	   Zyuganov demanded that Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's
government together with parliament approve changes in the
constitution curbing the president's powers and increasing their
own authority.
	   Zyuganov also suggested that the constitution be revised to have
a president elected by a representative assembly instead of a
popular vote.
	   He also called for setting up ``observation'' boards made up of
lawmakers for Russian television networks and other media to end
what he said was pro-Yeltsin news coverage.
	   Responding to a question about recent anti-Semitic remarks by
Ret. Gen. Albert Makashov, a fellow Communist, Zyuganov said he
stood for friendly relations between all ethnic groups. In the next
moment, however, he echoed Makashov, saying it's ``insulting to
watch a number of programs which don't feature a single (ethnic)
Russian face.''
	   Other presidential hopefuls include Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
and Alexander Lebed, a former general who is now governor of a vast
Siberian province.
	   Zyuganov has been sharply critical of Lebed, but said a
``dialogue'' was possible with Luzhkov, whom he called a ``very
experienced man.''

Huge shopping complex to be built in Hungary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Construction teams broke ground Tuesday
for Hungary's biggest project to date _ a shopping and
entertainment complex touted as bringing the American lifestyle to
Hungary.
	   The West End City Center complex, will be built in three phases,
the last of which is to be completed by 2005. When completed, it
will offer shopping, entertainment, sports facilities, hotels and
parks.
	   The dlrs 300 million-project is being funded by Toronto-based
TrizecHahn Corp., one of the biggest North American real estate
development firms, headed by Chairman Peter Munk, a Hungarian-born
Canadian.
	   Munk said his company recently sold off its North American
malls, generating dlrs 2 billion, it is using to expand in Europe.
	   ``Our strategy is to move our investment in shopping centers and
entertainment from North America to Europe,'' said Munk.
	   In addition to the Hungarian project, the company is involved in
projects in Spain, Italy, Germany and Slovakia.
	   Jozsef Finta, one of Hungary's best known architects, designed
the complex, together with the Los Angeles-based Jerde Partnership.
	   Not everyone, however, is excited about the new mall. During
last week's commemoration of the 1956 revolt against Soviet rule,
the head of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's junior coalition partner,
attacked presence in Hungary.
	   ``Today we are not threatened by tanks, but, much more
insidiously, by globalization. Budapest is ringed just as it was in
1956, but now it is multinational companies of uncertain
backgrounds that are preparing to occupy us with their malls,''
said Sandor Lezsak, chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum.
	   Munk, however, disagreed.
	   ``We can invest our money only where we feel there is broad
support. In democratic countries there are always the crazies who
oppose progress,'' he said. ``If they were to represent the
majority, no one would invest in Hungary.''
	   Since communism collapsed in 1990, shopping malls have sprung up
like mushrooms across Hungary. Budapest and its surrounding area
already boasts 24 malls, and plans exist for 15 more to be built.

Euro 2000 ticketing seeks to avoid World Cup mishaps
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-Euro 2000 &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Euro 2000 has learned from the
World Cup ticketing scandal. On Tuesday it pledged a fairer system,
more open to all Europeans and free of package deals that left
thousands without seats in France.
	   The first of the 1.23 million tickets for the June 10-July 2,
2000 European Championships, the biggest single sports event
barring the World Cup, will go on sale next spring with the
participating teams and the public at large getting a shot at
almost three-quarters of the available seats.
	   ``We are doing it differently than others. We are giving
everyone an honest and fair chance,'' said Harry Been, Euro 2000
board secretary. Euro 2000 is jointly organized by Belgium and the
Netherlands.
	   For the World Cup in France, some 65 percent of the 2.5 million
tickets were sold on the French market, creating an uproar from
other European nations.
	   The European Union challenged the World Cup organizers and EU
parliamentarians took them to court, trying to obtain more tickets
for the public but the measures were too little too late.
	   Euro 2000 organizers want to avoid such problems.
	   Some 37 percent of tickets will be sold to the general public
and 32 percent to the two nations involved in the match concerned.
	   The World Cup in France was also heavily criticized for offering
only 8 percent of tickets to each team involved in a match.
	   ``Interest is expected to be overwhelming,'' said Been. Some 26
million people, most of the them Europeans, tried to buy World Cup
tickets this summer.
	   Hospitality seats, offering meals, guaranteed parking and other
luxuries, make up another five percent of tickets, raising the
total of seats sold directly to the public to 74 percent.
	   The rest of the seats will be reserved for UEFA, FIFA, the
participating cities and the media.
	   Euro 2000 has also done away with package deals to travel
agencies that offered hotels, transport and tickets in one
contract. Such a system caused many problems at the World Cup.
	   Thousands of fans arrived with package tours this summer only to
find out the tickets were not available on match day.
	   ``An honest system implies that the tickets will be offered to
the supporters without intermediaries, such as tour operators, and
not as part of a wider service package,'' an Euro 2000 statement
said.
	   Euro 2000 will be the first major sporting event organized in
two nations. The games will be played in eight stadiums, four in
the Netherlands and four in Belgium. The host nations automatically
qualify.

Ex-Nomura officials agree to pay shareholders over sokaiya losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Six former executives of Nomura Securities Co.
agreed Tuesday to compensate the company's shareholders for losses
incurred in payoffs to corporate racketeers, news reports said.
	   In an out-of-court settlement, the six, including former Nomura
President Hideo Sakamaki, agreed to pay a total of 380 million yen
(dlrs 3.18 million) to the shareholders, Kyodo News reported.
	   The shareholders had claimed in a lawsuit that the executives
were responsible for some 360 million yen (dlrs 3.02 million) that
Nomura illegally funneled to ``sokaiya'' racketeer Ryuichi Koike.
	   The three former officials who face criminal charges in the
scandal _ Sakamaki, 63, Nobutaka Fujikura, 56, and Shimpei Matsuki,
54 _ admitted legal responsibility for the payoffs in the civil
suit, Kyodo said.
	   Three others, who weren't named, acknowledged ``moral''
responsibility, the report said.
	   The plaintiffs also contended that the six should pay damages
for about 57 million yen (dlrs 480,000) in losses incurred after
local governments dropped Nomura as their bond underwriter in the
wake of the payoff scandal.
	   Court officials were unavailable for comment late Thursday.
	   Japan's financial world has been shaken in recent years by a
string of arrests that have exposed cozy ties between company
executives, government bureaucrats and members of organized crime.
	   ``Sokaiya'' extort money from companies by threatening to reveal
embarrassing secrets at shareholders meetings. Dealing with them is
illegal.

Milosevic refuses to back down on media crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic is
refusing to back down on his ongoing purge of Serbia's fledgling
independent media, a special U.S. envoy said Tuesday.
	   Speaking to representatives of independent Serbian media, U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill promised he would further press the issue
with the autocratic Yugoslav president when he meets him later
Tuesday.
	   ``I assure you I have raised the issue at the highest level here
very forcefully,'' Hill told reporters. ``I am sorry to say... we
don't seem to have ... results.''
	   Last week, Serbian parliament passed a new media law, severely
restricting press freedoms and instituting sky-high fines for those
publishing ``anti-patriotic'' and ``anti-government'' stories.
	   ``You can not wipe out independent media any more than you can
deprive people of oxygen,'' Hill said, adding the new law was
``something not in keeping with the standards of Europe and the
rest of the international community.''
	   ``It is a 19th century means, not worthy even of the Ottoman
empire,'' Hill said, referring to Serbia's longtime enemy, the
Ottoman Turks.
	   On Monday, two Serbian independent dailies halted publishing
after police raided the office and confiscated property of another
non-government newspaper fined for alleged anti-state activity.
	   The two, Nasa Borba and Danas, had been briefly banned by the
government earlier this month, said they would not resume
publishing to protest the new media law which reimposes state
censorship.
	   Monday night, police raided the private apartment of Ivan Tadic,
manager of DT-press publishing company which issues weekly
Evropljanin (The European).
	   The weekly was fined the equivalent of dlrs 246,000 over the
weekend by a Belgrade court for publishing an article that accused
Milosevic of introducing ``dictatorship'' and leading the country
into political and economic chaos.
	   All Tadic's personal belongings were impounded and taken away
except his baby's crib and clothes.
	   The restrictive media law was passed amid anti-Western sentiment
in the country, fueled by NATO threats to launch airstrikes to end
the crisis in Kosovo. Ethnic Albanian secessionists have been
battling Yugoslav troops in the southern Serbian province.
	   ``While we've often said that the route for Yugoslavia's
reintegration into the West is going through Kosovo, I think we now
have another transit point, and that is gaining freedom for the
media,'' Hill said.
	   Yugoslavia cannot hope to become a full fledged member of the
international community and Europe with this type of censorship, he
said.
	   ``This issue of media is gaining altitude fast,'' Hill said
Tuesday. ``This situation is totally unnecessary and needs to be
fixed fast.''
	   ``In the long run, we don't see that we'll have the overall
progress we need to make in Yugoslavia unless this issue is
resolved,'' Hill stressed.

American Embassy in Ukraine goes on terrorist attack alert
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine has beefed up
security after receiving a threat of a possible terrorist attack,
embassy officials said Tuesday.
	   An embassy employee who requested anonymity confirmed to The
Associated Press that a threat had been made to the embassy,
located downtown in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev. The employee
would say when the threat was made or detail the nature of the
warning.
	   Security around the embassy has been increased since the threat,
the employee said, without providing other details.
	   The Kyiv Post newspaper said Ukrainian police usually guarding
the embassy compound were replaced with troops equipped with
automatic weapons and flak jackets.
	   Security personnel also have lined the fence around the
three-story former Communist Party building with knee-high flower
planters, made of reinforced concrete and commonly used to deter
suicide car bombers, the daily said.
	   An announcement posted at the embassy compound also said
``additional security precautions are being taken and the Ukrainian
authorities continue to provide full support to ensure the security
of the embassy as well as the other mission elements.''
	   The message was also relayed to the embassy's warden system,
part of a volunteer organization set up by the U.S. authorities
abroad to distribute emergency messages to American residents.
	   Since the Aug. 7 bombing of American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, officials say the number of threats to American embassies
around the world has risen dramatically, to two or three a day from
one or two a week.
	   The two Africa blasts killed 224 people, including 12 Americans,
and injured more than 5,000. The United States suspected Islamic
militants of being involved and carried out retaliatory cruise
missile attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   The State Department issued a worldwide caution to Americans
abroad after the attack and the FBI warned U.S. businesses to
beware of ``heightened risks to U.S. interests worldwide.''

U.N. human rights experts to visit Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ United Nations experts on violence against women
and racism will visit Indonesia in November, a U.N. spokesman said
Tuesday.
	   The visit, at the Indonesian government's invitation, follows
the signing in August of a cooperation agreement between the U.N.
High Commissioner for Human Rights and Indonesia.
	   The experts will look at violence against Indonesia's Chinese
minority during riots that forced the resignation earlier this year
of longtime ruler Suharto, U.N. human rights spokesman Jose Diaz
said.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised
greater political freedom and respect for human rights.
	   More than 1,200 people were killed in May's riots. Much of the
violence was directed against the Chinese minority, which makes up
about four percent of the 202 million population.
	   They are resented by some for their success in business and
commerce as Indonesia grapples with its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   Human rights and women's groups say that at least 168 girls and
women, many of them Chinese, were raped.
	   Exact dates for the joint visit by Radhika Coomaraswamy, the
special investigator on women, and Maurice Glele-Ahanhanzo, the
expert on racism, have yet to be fixed, Diaz added.
	   A visit to Indonesia by a U.N. working group on enforced or
involuntary disappearances is also expected ``early next year,'' he
said.
	   The agreement between Indonesia and the United Nations is
understood to allow access to East Timor, annexed by Indonesia in
1976, for human rights observers.
	   It also provided for an increased U.N. human rights presence in
the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. ``A draft proposal has been
submitted to Indonesia and we expect to have a response soon,''
Diaz said.

	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas fired rockets into the
Israeli-occupied zone of southern Lebanon on Tuesday, killing an

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat who
defeated Chancellor Helmut Kohl in elections last month on promises
to modernize Germany after 16 years of conservative rule, took
office as Germany's seventh postwar chancellor Tuesday.
	   President Roman Herzog formally named Schroeder to the post,
wishing him ``the courage to tackle necessary changes'' to keep
Germany globally competitive.
	   Earlier, the new parliament confirmed Schroeder. Though the vote
was expected, he clearly savored the moment, smiling slowly then
standing to embrace Social Democratic party leader Oskar Lafontaine
after the new parliament's president announced the results: 351 in
favor, 287 against with 27 abstentions.
	   Schroeder acknowledged the vote, stating simply, ``I accept the
election.''
	   Schroeder, 54, will lead Germany into the 21st century and
through some critical changes, including the government's move to
Berlin and the adoption of the single European currency to replace
the German mark. He was to be sworn in later Tuesday.
	   Parliament president Wolfgang Thierse wished Schroeder
``strength and much success for our country.''
	   Kohl, who was relieved of office Monday, waited until after the
vote was confirmed to shake Schroeder's hand, showing no emotion as
he turned away. Other members of Kohl's Cabinet followed his lead.
	   The parliament later was to confirm Schroeder's Cabinet
ministers, and he was to convene the first Cabinet meeting by
evening.
	   Schroeder and his coalition partner, the environmentalist Greens
party, are pledging to put Germans back to work, make it easier for
foreign residents to get citizenship and move toward shutting down
nuclear power plants. Continuity is the byword in foreign policy.

Officials remove mercury spill in eastern Russian republic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A mercury spill was discovered in a heavily
populated area in the Russian republic of Buryatia and a cleanup
operation is underway, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   Twelve converters with glass pipes containing 150 grams (5.25
ounces) of mercury each were found at a bus stop in the Buryat
capital of Ulan-Ude. Some of the pipes had been smashed and the
mercury had leaked out, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   It was not known how the devices, described in the report as
converters from local industrial companies, wound up at the bus
stop, located about 4,400 kilometers (2,700 miles) southeast of
Moscow.
	   Police cordoned off the area. The report did not say if anyone
was affected by the spill.
	   A criminal investigation was opened, ITAR-Tass said.

<TEXT>
	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduras braced for potential
catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch roared through the northwest
Caribbean with heart-stopping strength, churning up high waves and
intense rain that sent coastal residents fleeing for safer ground.
	   President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum
alert and the Honduran military sent planes to pluck residents from
their homes on islands near the coast. Poor coastal neighborhoods
flooded.
	   At 1200 GMT, Mitch was 90 miles (150 kilometers) north of
Honduras and moving west _ parallel to the coast _ at 8 mph (13
kph). With winds near 180 mph (305 kph), and even higher gusts, the
350-mile (600 kilometer) hurricane was a Category 5 monster _ the
highest, most dangerous rating for a storm.
	   ``Mitch is closing in,'' said Monterrey Cardenas, mayor of
Utila, an island 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the Honduran coast.
``And God help us.''
	   The National Weather Service said Mitch was the fourth most
powerful hurricane in the Caribbean's recorded history, after
1988's Gilbert, 1980's Allen, 1969's Camille and an unnamed 1935
storm.
	   Forecasts had Mitch swirling parallel to the Honduran coast,
then turning to the north over the next two days, heading straight
for the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and its resorts of Cancun and
Cozumel.
	   Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States,
forecasters said.
	   The U.S. National Weather Service in Miami said Mitch could
weaken somewhat, but warned it would still remain ``a very
dangerous hurricane capable of causing catastrophic damage.''
	   In La Ceiba, on the western Honduran coast, people waded
knee-deep to their houses after rains from Mitch's outer swells
sent rivers rising. Many people took refuge in fire stations and
schools, but others ignored orders to evacuate.
	   ``I'm not going anywhere,'' said Teresa Nunez, 38, who lives in
a simple wooded house by the beach with her 11 children. ``I don't
have much, and I'm afraid they'll steal that.''
	   The entire coast of Honduras was under a hurricane warning and
up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain was forecast in mountain
areas.
	   The Honduran president closed schools and public offices on the
coast Monday and ordered all air force planes and helicopters to
evacuate people from the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small
islands off the country's central coast.
	   The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco,
said 5,000 soldiers were standing by to help victims of the storm,
but he warned the military could not reach everyone.
	   ``For that humanitarian work, we would need more than 300
Hercules C-137 planes,'' he said. ``Honduras doesn't have them.''
	   A hurricane warning was also in effect for the Caribbean coast
of Guatemala.
	   In Belize, the government issued a hurricane warning Tuesday.
Schools were closed and workers sent home early Monday. Panic
buying stripped bread from the shelves of some stores and some
gasoline stations ran dry. Coastal Belize City was hit so hard by
Hurricane Hattie in 1961 that the country built a new capital
inland at Belmopan.
	   Mexico mobilized troops and emergency workers on the east coast
of the Yucatan peninsula, which was also under a hurricane watch,
and Cuba said it had evacuated 600 vacationers from the Island of
Youth.
	   On the Honduran island of Utila, fisherman Swinwick Jackson had
tied up his boats and was taking his family to stay with a relative
on higher ground.
	   National police spokesman Ivan Mejia said the Coco, Segovia and
Cruta rivers all overflowed their banks Monday along Honduras'
eastern coast. ``Frightened people are moving into the mountains to
search for shelter,'' he said.
	   In El Progreso, 100 miles (180 kilometers) north of the Honduran
capital of Tegucigalpa, the army evacuated more than 5,000 people
who live in low-lying banana plantations along the Ulua River, said
Nolly Soliman, a resident.
	   The strongest hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory was
Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras' Caribbean coast, killing at
least 2,000 people.

Asian investors dismiss Clinton scandal as amusing, says analyst
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asians who have invested in the United
States tend to dismiss its presidential sex scandal as amusing but
acknowledge that prolonging it could mean trouble for world markets
and U.S. foreign policy, an American analyst said Tuesday.
	   ``It has been striking to me that most Asian investors don't
take the issue very seriously,'' said Thomas Gallagher, a managing
directors of U.S. investment banker Lehman Brothers.
	   President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former
White House intern, ``is a kind of a source of amusement, a trivial
matter, at least a personal matter, and it doesn't seem (to them)
like the sort of thing that would drive a president from office,''
Gallagher said in a briefing to Bangkok-based journalists.
	   Gallagher, head of Lehman's equity research office, was
concluding a tour of East Asia to provide regional clients with an
assessment of the investment implications of recent policy actions
and political developments in Washington. He visited Japan, South
Korea, Singapore and Malaysia before coming to Thailand.
	   Though Gallagher doesn't think Clinton will be driven from
office, he believes that how the scandal is resolved may be less
important than how soon it is resolved.
	   ``It's a cliche to say this but the market doesn't like
uncertainty,'' he said.
	   Management of foreign affairs stands at greatest risk and
Clinton will have difficulties advancing his agenda as the scandal
drags on, he said.
	   A trend that could prove disturbing for Asian investors is a
slowdown in the U.S. economy, accompanied by an unemployment rate
that is expected to rise to 5.4 percent by the end of next year, he
added.
	   This could result in more isolationist, inward-looking
politicians winning election, and lead to protectionist policies
that would block Asian imports, he said.

Second Nazi war criminal in Lithuania faces possible trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ The case against alleged Nazi war
criminal Kazys Gimzauskas could go to court next month, pending a
final decision by a judge, according to Lithuania's prosecutor
general.
	   Gimzauskas, 90, is accused of sending scores of Jews to their
deaths when he was deputy head of the Nazi-sponsored security
police during the 1941-44 German occupation of Lithuania.
	   ``Gimzaukas is accused of physically assisting in the extinction
of Jewish Lithuania citizens while subordinate to the occupation
authorities,'' Lithuania's prosecutor's office said in a statement
Monday.
	   More than 200,000 Jews were killed during Nazi rule in
Lithuania.
	   In the police unit, Gimzauskas was deputy to Aleksandras
Lileikis, 91, who also faces trial. His trial was fixed for
September but has been repeatedly delayed. It is slated to resume
on November 5.
	   Gimzauskas is said to be ill and bedridden and, like Lileikis,
is expected to use his illness to try and delay legal proceedings
against him.
	   Jewish groups have accused Lithuanian authorities of taking too
long to bring both Lileikis and Gimzauskas to court.
	   Within a matter of days, a judge is expected to make a final
decision about whether prosecutors have enough evidence to bring
Gimzaukas to court
	   Gimzaukas fled to Lithuania from St.Pertersburg, Florida, in
1993 after being stripped of his U.S. citizenship for lying about
his Nazi past.

	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Two men were arrested in Munich for
possessing high-quality forged U.S. currency totaling nearly a
quarter of a million dollars, police said Tuesday.
	   A 32-year-old Dutch man and a 44-year-old German were arrested
last Wednesday in a Munich hotel with 2,400 forged 100 dollar bills
in a briefcase, police said in a statement.
	   Police believe the forgeries may have originated in Italy.
	   The men had driven to Munich from the Netherlands, where they
lived, to look for takers for the forged money, which police said
was of high enough quality to enter circulation undetected.

Agreement ends 20-day state employees' strike in Colombia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAVIER BAENA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ After nearly two days of marathon
negotiations, Colombia's government and labor leaders reached an
agreement Tuesday ending a 20-day strike by state employees, the
longest and costliest in the nation's history.
	   ``There are neither victors nor vanquished,'' President Andres
Pastrana told reporters before departing for Washington for a state
visit. The walkout was the severest test of Pastrana's leadership
in his nearly three months in office.
	   The strike was marred by violent street protests in several
cities and the assassinations of four union activists including the
vice president of one of Colombia's largest labor federations.
	   Under the settlement, the government agreed to average 15
percent wage increases in 1999 for the more than 650,000 state
employees, one percentage point higher than its original offer and
a point lower than projected 1998 inflation.
	   The public employee unions had sought 18 percent increases.
	   The government also agreed not to carry through with a threat to
dock the pay of workers who participated in the walkout, while
unions failed to persuade Pastrana to halt privatizations of
inefficient state-owned companies, or to modify his austerity plan,
which includes public spending cuts.
	   The strike halted classes for millions of public school
students, forced most public hospitals to offer only emergency
services and interrupted some telecommunications services.
	   In order to assure the availability of gasoline, Pastrana
ordered the military to take over refineries and other
installations of the state-owned Ecopetrol oil company early in the
walkout.
	   It was never clear what percentage of union rank-and-file heeded
the strike. The government's estimation of less than 50 percent
appears closer to the truth than the 95 percent claimed by union
leaders.
	   The president of the State Workers' Federation, Wilson Borja,
estimated the strike cost the nation 1 billion pesos (dlrs 628
million).

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian and South Korean ships held a joint
military exercise Tuesday to practice preventing emergency
situations at sea, a news report said.
	   The exercises in the Bay of Peter the Great, off Russia's Far
East in the Sea of Japan, involved a South Korean frigate and a
support ship and a Russian submarine and other vessels, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing Russia's Pacific Navy
command.
	   The Korean ships also visited Russia's port of Vladivostok and
were to head home after the exercise, the report said.
	   The Soviet Union was a long-time ally of South Korea's rival,
communist North Korea, but Russia and South Korea have strengthened
economic and diplomatic ties since the 1991 Soviet collapse.

<TEXT>
	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Manchester police were in Valletta
Tuesday for the exhumation of a Maltese woman suspected of being
the victim of a British doctor already charged with murdering four
patients.
	   The family of Marie Antoinette Fernley is expected to give their
consent for an exhumation later this week.
	   A native of Malta, Fernley lived in Britain and was a patient of
Dr. Harold Shipman, a family doctor from Hyde in Greater
Manchester, northern England. Fernley died in March 1995 and was
buried in Malta.
	   Shipman, 52, was charged in September with murdering an
81-year-old widow, Kathleen Grundy, falsely obtaining cash and
property worth 300,000 pounds (dlrs 500,000) from her estate and
forging a will and two letters.
	   He was later charged with murdering three other patients after
their bodies were exhumed. Police are investigating the deaths of
more than 20 other patients of Shipman's.

Romanian IOC member Alexandru Siperco dies at age 77
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Alexandru Siperco, the longest-serving
member on the International Olypmic Committee, has died at the age
of 77.
	   Siperco, who had served on the IOC for 43 years since his
election in 1955, died at his Bucharest home Monday of a heart
attack, according to the Romanian Olympic Committee.
	   ``He didn't seem to be suffering at all,'' said Crin Antonescu,
Romania's Minister of Sport and Youth, who met with Siperco three
weeks ago. ``He was very energetic. It's a great loss and his life
was dedicated to the International Olympic Committee.''
	   Siperco, born in Tataresti in 1920, was president of the
Romanian Olympic Committee from 1952 to 1959.
	   He was an IOC executive board member from 1979 to 1986, and IOC
vice president from 1982 to 1986.
	   Siperco became the ``doyen'' of the IOC when the Grand Duke of
Luxembourg, who had served on the IOC since 1946, resigned earlier
this year.
	   Siperco, who is survived by his wife and five children, would
have turned 78 on Nov. 5.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch sent a letter of condolence
to Siperco's family, saying, ``We shall all remember Mr. Siperco
for his distinguished service to the Olympic family.''
	   Samaranch is expected to attend Siperco's funeral Wednesday.
	   Siperco is the second IOC member to die in the past 10 days.
	   Spain's Carlos Ferrer Salat, president of the Spanish Olympic
Committee, died Oct. 18 in Barcelona of a heart attack.

Hamas to continue war with Israel, says leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A leader of the radical Palestinian group
Hamas was quoted Tuesday as saying that his movement will continue
fighting Israel despite its peace accord with Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.
	   Khalid Mashaal, the head of the Hamas' political bureau, also
predicted that the Palestinian Authority will not be able to
fulfill its pledges to destroy militant groups under the new Middle
East deal.
	   ``We are not weak nor can we be easily broken,'' Mashaal was
quoted as saying in an interview with the Islamic-oriented Al-Shaab
newspaper.
	   ``No one can destroy Hamas or end its role. Our battle will be
with the Zionist enemy and our people will be our wall of
protection,'' said Mashaal, who is based in Jordan.
	   Hamas is opposed to any peace deal with Israel and advocates the
annihilation of Israel. It has been blamed for several fatal
attacks on Israelis in the past.
	   Under the accord signed Friday in Washington by the Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, the authority has agreed to track down Palestinian radicals
blamed for attacks on Israelis. The CIA would keep track of the
efforts to arrest and punish these elements as a way of alleviating
Israeli security concerns.
	   Mashaal was quoted as saying that the implementation of the
agreement will inevitably spark a confrontation with the
Palestinian security forces.
	   He also blasted the task assigned to the CIA in the agreement,
saying that will make the American intelligence service a partner
'' in suppressing the Palestinian people.''
	   Mashaal said the CIA has in the past investigated Hamas members
in cooperation with the Palestinian security.

Indian skipper to make cricketing history
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, India (AP) _ Indian skipper Mohammad Azharuddin is all
set to make cricketing history as the first man to play 300 one-day
internationals when he goes to toss in the Will International Cup
quarterfinal against Australia on Wednesday.
	   Azharuddin is also 94 runs short of Desmond Haynes' world record
of 8,648 runs. Even if he doesn't hit a century, the Indian captain
will make it to the record books on the strength of his one-day
appearances.
	   All tickets for the India-Australia match have been sold out and
the 36,000 capacity stadium is expected to burst at the seams when
the match starts Wednesday afternoon.
	   The Australian cricket board has chosen a specialist one-day
side under Steve Waugh for this knockout tournament. While half of
the team arrived from Karachi, Pakistan, on Tuesday afternoon,
almost half a dozen specialists like Michael Bevan, Adam Gilchrist
and the young sensation Andrew Symond were flown in directly from
home.
	   The Australians have played a lot of cricket in the Indian
sub-continent recently and have found the wickets to their liking.
With the Bangabandhu national stadium producing so many runs in the
last three games, Wednesday's match could be a big scorer.
	   For the Indians, the national stadium has been lucky. If they
beat the Australians in the quarterfinal, they will be a step
closer to their third win in Dhaka.
	   India won the Asia Cup in 1988 under Dilip Vengsarkar and,
earlier this year, Azharuddin made a triumphant comeback as captain
of the national team with the Bangladesh Independence Cup win.
	   In their last match earlier this year, India beat Australia in
the Coca Cola Trophy final in Sharjah. But considering the format
of this tournament, which includes the new bowl-out formula, the
team can rely very little on history.

	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ A leader of a Palestinian militant group
narrowly escaped death Tuesday when he pulled his family away from
his booby-trapped car seconds before it exploded, witnesses said.
	   The car bombing wounded Mahmoud Majzoub, his wife Noha, their
9-month-old son Hussein and a Syrian passer-by, security officials
said.
	   They were admitted to a hospital with burns, bruises, broken
bones and wounds from bits of the blasted car. Officials at Hammoud
Hospital said the victims were in ``stable'' condition, but the boy
_ whose age was earlier given as 4 _ was in intensive care.
	   The 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) blast also shattered windows of nearby
shops and damaged cars on a main road in east Sidon, 45 kilometers
(30 miles) south of Beirut.
	   Police set up checkpoints around Sidon in a bid to catch the
perpetrators. Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul announced a ban on
arms for residents of the city, the capital of southern Lebanon.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attempted
assassination. The Lebanese leader of Islamic Jihad, the group to
which Majzoub belongs, blamed Israel.
	   ``The Zionist enemy is fully responsible,'' Abu Imad Rifai told
a news conference in Sidon. Referring to the Israeli-Palestinian
agreement signed in Washington on Friday, he said the bombing was
``a fruit of the agreements of humiliation and submission.''
	   In Jerusalem, Israeli military officials had no immediate
comment.
	   Witnesses told The Associated Press that Majzoub, 31, noticed
something was wrong as he was about to start his car outside his
house. He told his wife to grab the child, get out and run for
cover.
	   They were only meters (yards) away when the Volvo sedan
exploded, witnesses said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Explosives experts at the scene estimated that the bomb was made
of 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) of TNT.
	   Majzoub is a senior member of Jihad in Sidon. He was born in the
city but, like some Lebanese, joined the Palestinian group which is
staunchly opposed to peace with Israel.
	   The group held a rally Sunday in Ein El-Hilweh, the large
Palestinian refugee camp outside Sidon, to mark the third
anniversary of the assassination of its leader, Fathi Shekaki.
Shekaki was gunned down outside a hotel in Malta in 1995 in a hit
widely blamed on Israeli agents.
	   Sidon has seen a spate of shootings in the past three months in
which the victims were often liquor store owners. On Saturday, two
policemen were shot dead by a gunman on a motorbike. Security
officials believe Muslim fundamentalist groups, seeking a ban on
alcohol, could be behind the attacks.

Rotterdam beats Amsterdam in race to host Euro 2000 final

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Winning a high-stakes showdown
between two rivals, Feyenoord's Rotterdam edged out Ajax's
Amsterdam Tuesday in the quest to host the Euro 2000 final.
	   In a head-to-head battle between the Dutch capital and the
nation's second city, Rotterdam's De Kuip stadium was awarded the
July 2 final instead of Amsterdam's state of the art Arena.
	   The opening match of the championship finals, which will be
co-hosted by the Netherlands and Belgium, will be in Brussels' King
Baudouin Stadium.
	   ``De Kuip made an offer to Euro 2000 that gives maximum
guarantees that we will enjoy a fantastic final here,'' said Jeu
Sprengers, joint president of the board of the Euro 2000
foundation.
	   The 50,000-seat Rotterdam stadium, home to Feyenoord, was given
the match on the basis of its stronger financial package, and not
for sporting reasons, Sprengers said.
	   ``This is a great disappointment,'' Arena spokeswoman Nicole
Meskers said. ``We can't understand it, particularly since there
has been virtually no contact between the Arena and the organizers
in the last year.''
	   The Arena, which also seats 50,000, boasts the latest in stadium
design including a sliding roof that can be closed during heavy
rain. But its playing surface has had to be dug up and replaced six
times since it opened in 1996.
	   The recently-renovated Kuip meanwhile is steeped in soccer
history dating back to 1937 and has an excellent pitch.
	   But UEFA official Guido Tognoni said the grass in both stadiums
did not play a major role in the decision.
	   ``It's always possible to make a new pitch within a few weeks,''
he said. ``For me, the pitch is not an issue.''
	   Both stadiums have a maximum five-star rating by UEFA. The Arena
hosted last season's Champions League Final between Real Madrid and
Juventus while De Kuip hosted the Cup Winners Cup final in 1997.
	   ``In sporting terms, there is no difference,'' Sprengers said.
``But their budget proposals were very different.''
	   Details of the proposals were not released.
	   The Arena got the consolation prize of hosting one of the
tournament's semifinals. The other will be played in Brussels.
	   Other matches will be played in the Dutch cities of Eindhoven
and Arnhem and in Belgian cities Bruges, Charleroi and Liege.
	   The draw for the finals is planned for Dec. 12, 1999, in
Brussels.
	   Amsterdam and Rotterdam have always been fierce rivals and are
always bent on outdoing one another in any field.
	   Feyenoord has won one European Champions' Cup (1970), three
fewer than Ajax.

Electronics makers Toshiba, Hitachi announce losses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to ADD that Hitachi also posted losses for first time
in decades; EDITS thruout to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's two biggest electronics companies, Hitachi
Ltd. and Toshiba Corp., on Tuesday announced multimillion-dollar
losses for the first half of fiscal 1998 _ the companies' first dip
into the red in nearly 50 years.
	   The two said losses resulted from Japan's recession, slumping
semiconductor and consumer electronics sales, and a drop in
semiconductor prices. Toshiba said the Asian financial crisis had
cut into demand for memory chips.
	   Hitachi, Japan's largest electronics maker, recorded a pretax
loss of 69.2 billion yen (dlrs 580 million) for the latest six
months compared to profits of 33.3 billion yen (dlrs 279 million) a
year earlier.
	   The company posted a net loss of 124.7 billion yen (dlrs 1.04
billion) for the half-year ending Sept. 30 against a profit of 24.3
billion yen (dlrs 204 million) the previous year.
	   Hitachi's sales were down 12 percent to 1.80 trillion yen (dlrs
15.1 billion) from 2.05 trillion yen (dlrs 17.2 billion) the
previous year.
	   It was Hitachi's first half-year of losses since 1950. Toshiba
suffered mid-term losses for the first time since 1949.
	   Toshiba, Japan's No. 2 electronics company, posted a 6.4 billion
yen (dlrs 53.6 million) pretax loss for the latest six months,
against a 25.4 billion yen (dlrs 212 million) profit in the same
period last year.
	   Toshiba also had a 6.4 billion yen (dlrs 53.6 million) net loss
for the half-year after posting a 22.45 billion yen (dlrs 188
million) profit the previous year.
	   Toshiba's sales were down 12.3 percent to 1.60 trillion yen
(dlrs 13.4 billion) from 1.82 trillion yen (dlrs 15.2 billion) the
previous year.
	   Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Japan's largest
comprehensive heavy machinery maker, announced a sharp fall in
profits for the half-year.
	   Mitsubishi's pretax profits fell to 50.6 billion yen (dlrs 424
million) from 74.31 billion yen (dlrs 622 million) a year earlier.
	   Its net profit dropped to 29.29 billion yen (dlrs 245 million)
from 43.3 billion yen (dlrs 363 million).
	   The company said orders fell as Japan's recession caused the
private sector to invest less in new factories and equipment.

Embattled Israeli premier reassures Jewish settlers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ No Israeli settlements will be isolated inside
Palestinian territory under the latest peace agreement, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared Tuesday.
	   Trying to reassure the settlers, once his strongest supporters
and now his loudest critics, Netanyahu said: ``I want to tell them
that the settlements will not be harmed.''
	   He called the settlers ``my friends and brothers.''
	   Settlers charge that the agreement Netanyahu signed with
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat at the White House
last week endangers their security. It calls for Israel to hand
over 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian civilian control.
The Palestinians already control West Bank cities.
	   Backing the settlers, Israeli hard-liners are trying to bring
Netanyahu's government down over the agreement.
	   Netanyahu's rivals from the moderate Labor Party pledged to back
the agreement and abstain in parliamentary votes of no confidence,
but they are joining forces with the hard-liners to push a bill to
advance Israel's elections to early next year.
	   Asked if calling early elections would stop implementation of
the new peace accord, Netanyahu said he would not relate to the
possibility, because he hoped ``it will not happen.''
	   ``The only thing that can prevent implementation of the
agreement is if the Cabinet does not approve it or the Palestinians
do not fulfill it,'' Netanyahu told reporters, invited to a routine
parliamentary committee meeting to give the Israeli leader another
chance to speak to his people about the agreement.
	   The Israeli political crisis surrounding the Washington accord
is not to be taken lightly, said David Bar Illan, Netanyahu's media
adviser. He told The Associated Press: ``It is a very touch and go
situation at this point.''

Taliban say they will exchange prisoners with opponents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban army said
Tuesday it was ready to exchange prisoners with its northern-based
opposition, but didn't say how many prisoners were involved or when
it would take place.
	   Contacted at his headquarters in the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar, Abdul Hai Muttmayan, a Taliban spokesman said the
exchange was brokered by Said Jalal, a close confidant of Saudi
Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who currently is on an official
visit to Pakistan.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Taliban's opposition,
led by former military chief Ahmed Shah Massood. The Taliban rule
90 percent of Afghanistan compared to the opposition which controls
about 10 percent.
	   According to Muttmayan, Jalal has spent the last week shuttling
between Kandahar and the Panjshir Valley, where Massood is based,
to broker the agreement.
	   Muttmayan refused to say how many prisoners the Taliban held,
but he said the opposition was holding hundreds of Taliban
soldiers.
	   He also said 30 Taliban soldiers were taken to Iran from central
Bamyan province, before the Taliban army overran the area and
defeated their Shiite Muslim enemies known in Afghanistan as
Hazaras, named for the region of the country where they live.
	   ``We want our prisoners wherever they are held to be released,''
he said. ``The exchange should be in the next few days.''
	   The prisoner exchange will not involve the International Red
Cross, according to Muttmayan and instead the prisoners will be
handed over at the front line where Taliban and opposition soldiers
face off.
	   The Taliban agreed to a similar exchange during negotiations a
week ago with the U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi.

Euro 2000 ticketing seeks to avoid World Cup mishaps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Euro 2000 has learned from the
World Cup ticketing scandal. On Tuesday it pledged a fairer system,
more open to all Europeans and free of package deals that left
thousands without seats in France.
	   The first of the 1.23 million tickets for the June 10-July 2,
2000 European Championship will go on sale next spring with the
participating teams and the public at large getting a shot at
almost 75 percent of the available seats.
	   ``We are doing it differently than others. We are giving
everyone an honest and fair chance,'' said Harry Been, Euro 2000
board secretary.
	   Euro 2000 will be jointly staged by Belgium and the Netherlands.
	   For the World Cup in France, about 65 percent of the 2.5 million
tickets were sold on the French market, creating an uproar from
other European nations.
	   The European Union challenged the World Cup organizers and EU
parliamentarians sued, trying to obtain more tickets for the public
outside France. Both attempts failed.
	   Euro 2000 organizers want to avoid such problems.
	   About 37 percent of tickets will be sold to the general public
and 32 percent to the two nations involved in the match concerned.
	   The World Cup in France also was heavily criticized for offering
only 8 percent of tickets to each team involved in a particular
match.
	   ``Interest is expected to be overwhelming,'' Been said.
	   About 26 million people, most of the them Europeans, tried to
buy World Cup tickets this summer.
	   Hospitality seats, offering meals, guaranteed parking and other
luxuries, make up another five percent of tickets, raising the
total of seats sold directly to the public to 74 percent.
	   The rest of the seats will be reserved for UEFA, FIFA, the
participating cities and the media.
	   Euro 2000 has also done away with package deals to travel
agencies that offered hotels, transport and tickets in one
contract. Such a system caused many problems at the World Cup.
	   Thousands of fans arrived with package tours this summer only to
find out the tickets were not available on match day.
	   ``An honest system implies that the tickets will be offered to
the supporters without intermediaries, such as tour operators, and
not as part of a wider service package,'' a Euro 2000 statement
said.
	   Euro 2000 will be the first major sporting event organized in
two nations. The games will be played in eight stadiums, four in
the Netherlands and four in Belgium. The host nations automatically
qualify.

Milosevic refuses to back down on media crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic is
refusing to back down on his ongoing purge of Serbia's fledgling
independent media, a special U.S. envoy said Tuesday.
	   Speaking to representatives of independent Serbian media, U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill promised he would further press the issue
with the autocratic Yugoslav president when he meets him later
Tuesday.
	   ``I assure you I have raised the issue at the highest level here
very forcefully,'' Hill told reporters. ``I am sorry to say... we
don't seem to have ... results.''
	   Last week, the Serbian parliament passed a new media law,
severely restricting press freedoms and instituting big fines for
those publishing ``anti-patriotic'' and ``antigovernment'' stories.
	   ``You cannot wipe out independent media any more than you can
deprive people of oxygen,'' Hill said, adding the new law was
``something not in keeping with the standards of Europe and the
rest of the international community.''
	   ``It is a 19th century means, not worthy even of the Ottoman
empire,'' Hill said, referring to Serbia's bygone enemy, the
Ottoman Turks.
	   On Monday, two Serbian independent dailies halted publishing
after police raided the office and confiscated property of another
non-government newspaper fined for alleged anti-state activity.
	   The two, Nasa Borba and Danas, had been briefly banned by the
government earlier this month, said they would not resume
publishing to protest the new media law.
	   Monday night, police raided the private apartment of Ivan Tadic,
manager of DT-press publishing company which issues weekly
Evropljanin (The European).
	   The weekly was fined the equivalent of dlrs 246,000 over the
weekend by a Belgrade court for publishing an article that accused
Milosevic of introducing ``dictatorship'' and leading the country
into political and economic chaos.
	   All Tadic's personal belongings were impounded and taken away
except his baby's crib and clothes.
	   The restrictive media law was passed amid anti-Western
sentiment, fueled by NATO threats to launch airstrikes to end the
crisis in Kosovo. Ethnic Albanian secessionists have been battling
Yugoslav troops in the southern Serbian province.
	   Yugoslavia cannot hope to become a full fledged member of the
international community and Europe with this type of censorship,
Hill said.
	   ``This issue of media is gaining altitude fast,'' Hill said
Tuesday. ``This situation is totally unnecessary and needs to be
fixed fast.''

U.N. envoy meets Myanmar opposition leader

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A special envoy of the U.N.
secretary-general met Tuesday with embattled Myanmar opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi, diplomatic sources said.
	   Alvaro de Soto, an assistant U.N. secretary-general, also met
with two leaders of Myanmar's military government on his official
visit to discuss political and human rights issues
	   De Soto arrived Tuesday morning on his fifth visit as a U.N.
envoy since 1995.
	   He last visited Myanmar _ also known as Burma _ in January in a
failed effort to facilitate a dialogue between the junta and Suu
Kyi, leader of the National League for Democracy.
	   De Soto met Suu Kyi during his January visit, as well as Gen.
Than Shwe, chairman of the ruling junta, and other government
leaders.
	   He is scheduled to meet the influential secretary-one of the
junta, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, Wednesday morning. On Tuesday, he met
Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw and Minister of the Chairman's Office
Brig. Gen. David Abel.
	   De Soto is expected to meet with Suu Kyi again Thursday after
his talks with Khin Nyunt, said diplomats, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Relations between the government and the opposition have
deteriorated sharply since de Soto's last visit, with the military
increasing its repression of the pro-democracy movement and Suu
Kyi's party increasing its challenges to the government's
legitimacy. In the past few months, almost 1,000 members of Suu
Kyi's party have been detained.
	   In August, Myanmar rejected Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
candidate to look into the military regime's treatment of Suu Kyi,
winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.
	   Annan had asked that Razali Ismail of Malaysia, former president
of the General Assembly, be allowed to make a quick trip after the
Myanmar government had repeatedly blocked Suu Kyi's attempts to
travel outside the capital to meet with members of her political
party.
	   Myanmar said there was no need for such a rushed trip.
	   The United States, among others, had sought Annan's
intervention.
	   On Tuesday, the government announced the release from detention
of 34 members of Suu Kyi's party, saying they ``have returned home
... after a successful exchange of views on safeguarding national
security.'' Several dozen detainees have apparently been released
in the past week or so.
	   At the same time, the government announced the latest in the
series of mass rallies it has been staging to support its position
against the opposition.
	   It said 21,000 people in Chin State held a meeting Monday at
which they ``unanimously passed two motions calling for
safeguarding and maintaining national development and ensuring
food, clothing and shelter needs of the people, maintaining and
safeguarding the stability of the state which has already been
achieved.''
	   Such jargon is commonly used to imply that the opposition would
endanger the country's stability and development.
	   The junta seized power in 1988 after violently suppressing
pro-democracy demonstrations. Suu Kyi's party won a landslide
victory in 1990 parliamentary elections, but the military refused
to yield power.
	   Western nations, including the United States, and private groups
such as Amnesty International say the junta is responsible for
substantial human rights abuses. The U.N. Human Rights Commission
also has reported abuses and sought to encourage governmental
reforms in Myanmar.

General strike shuts down Kashmiri capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Schools and shops were closed and streets
deserted in the capital of Indian-held Kashmir Tuesday as residents
observed a general strike marking the 51st anniversary of the day
Indian troops arrived to fight off attackers from Pakistan.
	   The strike called by a coalition of groups opposed to Indian
rule over Kashmir was generally peaceful. But at one point, police
lobbed tear gas to break up a downtown march and briefly detained
about a dozen strike leaders.
	   The Hindu maharaja who ruled mostly Muslim Kashmir had wanted
independence after the region was divided into India and Pakistan
with the end of British rule in August, 1947. But when Pakistani
marauders invaded, the maharaja turned to India for military help
and agreed to become part of India, setting off the first of two
India-Pakistani wars over Kashmir.
	   India has long held that the 1947 marauders' attack was
engineered by the Pakistani military. Kashmir ended up divided,
with two thirds in Indian hands and the rest held by Pakistan.
	   Muslim militants have been fighting since 1989 in Indian-held
Kashmir, predominately Hindu India's only Muslim-majority state.
Some of the militants want independence, while others want to merge
with neighboring and officially Islamic Pakistan.

EU voices support of Russian reforms, makes no new commitments
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
received promises of European Union support Tuesday for his
government's reform efforts but no new financial commitments to
bolster the country's devastated economy.
	   Instead, Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said he hoped the
second tranche of a dlrs 10.2 billion credit from the International
Monetary Fund can be transmitted as soon as Russia submits an
economic reform program.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
	   Primakov, substituting for ailing President Boris Yeltsin,
arrived here on a one-day visit to brief EU officials on economic
recovery plans and seek help in coping with Moscow's worst economic
crisis of the post-Soviet era.
	   But Klima and the president of the European Commission, Jacques
Santer, told him only that the EU would seek to intensify
cooperation with Russia.
	   ``The European Union underscores the need for the sustained
economic program, the improvement of the social situation'' in
Russia, Klima told reporters at a brief news conference after the
talks.
	   ``We deem it significant that the ... development of our mutual
relations on the basis of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement
is deepened by a fast implementation of commitments made'' by the
Russians, Klima declared.
	   Since the crisis in Russia intensified, the Europeans have made
clear they want to see evidence that Moscow will not veer from its
economic reform program before they will commit major funding to
help restore the Russian economy.
	   Primakov recalled that in the talks, the EU leaders had
``expressed satisfaction'' with the Russian government program
approved last Saturday.
	   ``This shows that we are doing all we can to put together an
economic market with a social component attached to it,'' Primakov
said. ``You can only carry out monetarism with the population on
your side,'' referring to a tight money policy.
	   Western governments and financial institutions have expressed
concern that the Russians might print large amounts of rubles to
cover expenses, thereby devaluing their currency.
	   ``We are very keen on having close links with the EU and we will
do what we can to achieve that,'' Primakov said, adding his talks
with the EU would be a ``leitmotiv'' for Russia to carry on. He
vaguely spoke of the ``real possibility by the EU Investment Bank
in Russia.''
	   ``We will do what we can to make sure that we can stabilize the
economic and social situation in the country,'' said Primakov.
	   Klima said that another meeting of the EU-Russia cooperation
committee would take place in Moscow in mid-December.
	   Earlier in the day, during his courtesy call on Austrian
President Thomas Klestil, Primakov praised Austria's role as a
neutral, non-NATO country, saying the ``neutral status of Austria
has helped not hurt'' it.
	   Primakov was accompanied by Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and
several other ministers in charge of economic and financial
policies.
	   Primakov, the former foreign minister, has been prime minister
for only six weeks and has yet to produce his own blueprint to deal
with the country's deep-rooted economic problems.
	   He is, however, widely respected by all political factions and
is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when Yeltsin has
receded into the background.
	   Before leaving Moscow, Primakov held talks with Yeltsin at the
president's country residence outside of Moscow, Yeltsin's press
service said.
	   Yeltsin authorized him to tell EU officials about the
government's plan to cope with the latest economic crisis,
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Russia's economic crisis, coupled with major downturns in East
Asia and Latin America, has sent shock waves through Europe at a
time when EU governments have taken a major turn to the left.
	   During their summit last weekend in Poertschach, Austria, the
EU's 15 leaders pledged to coordinate economic policies to cope
with financial crises in Russia and elsewhere.

Indian opposition leader accuses government of weakening nation
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian opposition leader Sonia Gandhi
electrified 5,000 young supporters at a pre-election rally Tuesday,
accusing the ruling Hindu nationalists of pushing a right-wing
agenda and wrecking the economy.
	   ``This is an ideological war, a war for history, a war for the
future of India,'' Gandhi, president of the country's main
opposition Congress Party, told a gathering of its youth wing ahead
of provincial elections in four states.
	   One of these is Delhi, where Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party is struggling to overcome a
series of setbacks that forced it to change its chief minister a
month before the Nov. 25 balloting.
	   On the Congress Party's agenda are issues it believes are vital
to the common people _ from the kitchen to the classroom.
	   Onions climbed to the top of politicians' agenda this month when
a massive shortage drove up prices by more than 700 percent and
forced common people to scramble, protest, even ambush grocers'
trucks for their staple vegetable.
	   The onion rush snowballed into a crisis for the government,
provoking charges that it had failed to fight off rising inflation
and other setbacks to the economy.
	   ``The economy is in ruins. The value of the rupee has reduced by
half since this government came to power,'' the Italian-born Gandhi
said, speaking in Hindi.
	   The crowd, consisting of Youth Congress members from across the
country, cheered lustily, waving flags of her Congress party and
holding up portraits of her assassinated husband, former Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
	   ``It seems this government is neither concerned enough, nor
capable enough to be able to help,'' Sonia Gandhi said.
	   The government found itself on slippery ground once more when it
sought to introduce changes in India's education system to
incorporate aspects of Hindu cultural identity the BJP stands for.
Critics of the move included some members of the ruling coalition
itself.
	   ``Now they want to change the constitution,'' Sonia Gandhi said,
referring to a suggestion by Defense Minister George Fernandes this
week that the secular 1950 constitution be reworked. ``There is a
conspiracy to finish off parliamentary democracy in India,'' she
said.
	   Sonia Gandhi said the BJP had broken the political consensus on
the nuclear issue, which she claimed her party had built over
decades, by setting off five nuclear tests in May. The Congress
party has governed India for most of its 50 years of independence.
	   ``India's position in the world has been considerably
weakened,'' she told her supporters.

Next week's Yeltsin-Tudjman meeting postponed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A meeting between Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and his Croatian counterpart has been postponed, a
presidential spokesman said Tuesday. The announcement was a further
sign of Yeltsin's continuing health problems.
	   Croatian President Franjo Tudjman was to have met Yeltsin in
Moscow on Monday. But Tudjman's spokesman, Tihomir Vinkovic, told
The Associated Press that Russia has asked Tudjman to postpone his
visit.
	   Yeltsin checked into a sanitarium earlier Tuesday, where he
would undergo ``a course of restoration treatment,'' his spokesman
Dmitry Yakushkin said.
	   On doctors' advise, who said he was suffering from high blood
pressure and extreme fatigue, Yeltsin on Monday canceled his visit
to Austria.
	   Vinkovic said the new date of Yeltsin-Tudjman meeting was not
immediately set.
	   Tudjman himself underwent surgery in late 1996 in the Washington
D.C. clinic for what the U.S. officials said was cancer. The
77-year-old president denied that, claiming that he only suffered
minor stomach problems.
	   He nevertheless cut down his public activities since then and
the trip to Russia was to be one of his rare trips abroad.

Spiritual leader calls on party to oppose peace deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The spiritual leader of a powerful religious
party called on his followers to reject a new Mideast peace
agreement Tuesday in which Israel is to hand over West Bank land to
Palestinian control.
	   Rabbi Avraham Shapira, considered the spiritual leader of the
National Religious Party and extremely influential over Jewish
settlers, ruled that it is forbidden to ``give a hand to this
horrible agreement.''
	   Many religious Jews believe that the West Bank is part of the
biblical land of Israel promised to Jews by God and that leaving it
constitutes sin.
	   As a result, the settlers and their government backers from
parties such as NRP, members of Netanyahu's coalition, oppose the
peace deal signed with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat which calls
for the transfer of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians.
	   In 1995, when then-prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was moving to
withdraw Israeli troops, from Palestinian cities, settlers and
right-wing politicians demonstrated violently against the plans,
painting Rabin as a traitor. In November of that year, Rabin was
assassinated by a right-wing religious Jew who opposed
land-for-peace.
	   With the third anniversary of Rabin's death approaching, calls
from those same group branding Netanyahu a traitor with blood on
his hands, stirred concern in Israel that a political killing could
come again.
	   ``I hope we won't repeat a horrible mistake,'' said President
Ezer Weizman.
	   Asked on Israel radio whether another assassination was
possible, Benny Elon, a lawmaker from the ultra-nationalist Moledet
party answered ``yes, of course.''
	   Israeli media reported this week that security had been
increased for Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai after the two returned from last week's Mideast
summit outside Washington.

Palestinians say they will boycott Jerusalem elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM, (AP) _ The Palestinian Authority on Tuesday urged
Palestinians to boycott next month's elections for mayor in
Jerusalem, saying participation would signal acceptance of Israeli
rule over all of the disputed city.
	   The status of Jerusalem is to be determined in talks on a
permanent Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement that have yet to
begin.
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, the sector Israel
captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war, as their capital.
However, Israel says it will never relinquish control over all of
the city which is sacred to Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
	   Faisal Husseini, the leading official of Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority in Jerusalem, told a news conference Tuesday
that the city's Palestinian residents should stay home on Nov. 10
when municipal elections are being held in Jerusalem.
	   ``We hope they will not participate,'' Husseini said.
	   Jerusalem has about 420,000 Jewish and 180,000 Palestinian
residents. Some 124,000 Palestinians are eligible to vote, said an
Israeli legislator, Naomi Hazan.
	   Husseini was expressing the traditional Palestinian view. The
PLO has always discouraged Palestinian residents of the city from
participating in the elections, saying this would be tantamount to
recognizing Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem.
	   However, some are taking a more pragmatic view.
	   Jonathan Kuttab, a Palestinian human rights lawyer, said that
although Palestinians may not necessarily get a share of power if
they vote and post candidates, they will become more informed on
issues involving them directly, such as the budget and services.
	   As a result of the Palestinians' refusal to vote, they have
received very little in services in return for the taxes they pay.
Many roads in east Jerusalem are full of potholes and classrooms
are overcrowded.
	   Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, a hard-liner in Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, is expected to be re-elected.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat who
defeated Chancellor Helmut Kohl in elections last month on promises
to modernize Germany after 16 years of conservative rule, took
office as Germany's seventh postwar chancellor Tuesday.
	   President Roman Herzog formally named Schroeder to the post,
wishing him ``the courage to tackle necessary changes'' to keep
Germany globally competitive.
	   Earlier, the new parliament confirmed Schroeder. Though the vote
was expected, he clearly savored the moment, smiling slowly then
standing to embrace Social Democratic party leader Oskar Lafontaine
after the new parliament's president announced the results: 351 in
favor, 287 against with 27 abstentions.

Yeltsin checks into sanitarium for open-ended stay

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An infirm Boris Yeltsin sought sanctuary Tuesday
at a rest home outside Moscow, retreating further from the
political spotlight and leaving the country guessing about the
exact nature of his illness.
	   The Russian leader, who has been an infrequent visitor to the
Kremlin in recent months, checked into the Barvikha sanitarium for
an open-ended stay to recover from what's been described as high
blood pressure and exhaustion.
	   Yeltsin has played only a marginal role in dealing with the
country's painful economic crisis, and some analysts say the
country is being guided mostly by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
who has been in office less than two months.
	   ``Ever since he was appointed, Primakov has been acting more as
a president than as a chairman of the government,'' said Nikolai
Petrov, a political analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for Peace
in Moscow.
	   Primakov traveled to Vienna, Austria, on Tuesday to fill in for
Yeltsin at a summit between Russia and the European Union. Yeltsin
called off the trip Monday due to his illness, the latest in a
string of maladies that have dogged him for years.
	   Primakov and Yeltsin met early Tuesday at the president's
Gorky-9 country residence outside Moscow before the prime minister
left for Vienna and Yeltsin moved to the sanitarium.
	   Russian television broadcast pictures of Yeltsin sitting in a
chair behind a small table and talking to Primakov. Yeltsin,
wearing a blue sweater, was not visibly ill. He nodded in response
to Primakov's comments, but their words were not broadcast.
	   The president and his doctors say Yeltsin has no crippling
illness and will serve out his term which lasts until the middle of
the year 2000.
	   Still, few people in Russia believe that Yeltsin, 67, will ever
again be the robust, reform-minded leader that he was during his
early years in power.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Tuesday that Yeltsin's
aides were ``mocking'' Russians by insisting the president had no
serious health problems.
	   ``Mr. Yeltsin's inability to work has been obvious to us for
quite a long time,'' Zyuganov told a news conference. He called for
Yeltsin to undergo an independent medical exam and for the results
to be made public.
	   Yeltsin has rarely put in full days at the Kremlin since the
spring, spending most of his time at country residences west of the
city.
	   The Barvikha sanitarium, where Yeltsin recuperated from heart
bypass surgery in 1996, has extensive medical facilities, but is
not considered a hospital.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Yeltsin would
undergo ``a course of restoration treatment,'' the Interfax news
agency reported. The length of his stay depends on the treatment
scheduled, he said, without elaborating.
	   Yeltsin's office said Monday the Russian leader was suffering
from an ``asthenic condition.'' Asthenia refers to a lack of
physical strength.
	   The Kremlin has often provided only partial information about
Yeltsin's ailments in the past, contributing to a general mood of
skepticism and speculation that his condition is worse than
announced.
	   If Yeltsin were to resign, Primakov would succeed him on an
interim basis, and new elections would be called within three
months.
	   Yakushkin, the presidential spokesman, said canceling the trip
to Austria was a difficult decision for Yeltsin, but he feared his
opponents would exploit any public signs of weakness.
	   ``He understands that this visit would be like a litmus test
watched by many politicians and, primarily, his foes,'' Yakushkin
said. ``He understands quite well that everyone would mostly watch
how he walks and talks, not the essence of the talks.''
	   Yeltsin postponed a meeting with Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman scheduled for next week in Moscow, Tudjman's spokesman said
Tuesday. Yeltsin has also put off a trip to Malaysia next month,
though his aides insist his schedule for other foreign trips
remains unchanged.

Spiritual leader calls on party to oppose peace deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTS to restire cycle designator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The spiritual leader of a powerful religious
party called on his followers to reject a new Mideast peace
agreement Tuesday in which Israel is to hand over West Bank land to
Palestinian control.
	   Rabbi Avraham Shapira, considered the spiritual leader of the
National Religious Party and extremely influential over Jewish
settlers, ruled that it is forbidden to ``give a hand to this
horrible agreement.''
	   Many religious Jews believe that the West Bank is part of the
biblical land of Israel promised to Jews by God and that leaving it
constitutes sin.
	   As a result, the settlers and their government backers from
parties such as NRP, members of Netanyahu's coalition, oppose the
peace deal signed with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat which calls
for the transfer of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians.
	   In 1995, when then-prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was moving to
withdraw Israeli troops, from Palestinian cities, settlers and
right-wing politicians demonstrated violently against the plans,
painting Rabin as a traitor. In November of that year, Rabin was
assassinated by a right-wing religious Jew who opposed
land-for-peace.
	   With the third anniversary of Rabin's death approaching, calls
from those same group branding Netanyahu a traitor with blood on
his hands, stirred concern in Israel that a political killing could
come again.
	   ``I hope we won't repeat a horrible mistake,'' said President
Ezer Weizman.
	   Asked on Israel radio whether another assassination was
possible, Benny Elon, a lawmaker from the ultra-nationalist Moledet
party answered ``yes, of course.''
	   Israeli media reported this week that security had been
increased for Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai after the two returned from last week's Mideast
summit outside Washington.

Two youths sentenced in robbery of Swedish family
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ A judge has sentenced two youths to
seven-year prison terms for seven years for robbing a Swedish
diplomat and his family at knifepoint.
	   Sifi Masango and Themba Magongo, both 18, robbed Thomas
Kjellson, the first secretary of the Swedish Embassy, and his
family in February when they stopped at a fallen tree blocking
their route to Mantenga falls, a tourist resort in this southern
African kingdom.
	   Magistrate Sabelo Mngomezulu told the youths on Monday the
stiffest possible sentences were called for as a deterrent to
others, the South African Press Association reported.

Leakey resigns parliamentary seat in Kenya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Richard Leakey, the world renowned
paleoanthropologist, resigned Tuesday a member of parliament
because his job as director of Kenya Wildlife Service is
incompatible with legislative duties.
	   ``I hand-delivered the letter to the speaker this morning
notifying him I have resigned,'' Leakey told a news conference.
	   Leakey was nominated to the 222-member parliament by his
opposition Safina party under a formula that allows all political
parties to nominate 12 legislators shared on the basis of each
party's numerical strength in the house.
	   Safina leader Paul Muite told the same news conference Kenya's
constitution does not allow the head of a public institution to
also serve as a member of parliament.
	   Muite said the party has nominated Josephine Odiro Sinyo, who is
blind, to replace Leakey, who uses artificial legs following an
aircraft accident some years ago.
	   Sinyo, who holds masters degree in law, said she will articulate
issues affecting Kenya's women and the disabled.
	   Last month, President Daniel arap Moi chose Leakey to head the
cash-strapped organization charged with the protection of wildlife
in Kenya.
	   A third-generation Kenyan of British origin, Leakey was pushed
out by Moi and other politicians in 1994 as director of KWS _ the
country's tourism asset _ in a dispute over political control of
the resource.
	   He was recalled after KWS tottered toward bankruptcy.

New German foreign minister sets direction in first trip abroad

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ On the same day he officially takes over as
foreign minister, Joschka Fischer will begin trips to Paris, London
and Warsaw, getting a quick start on the new government's key theme
of continuity in foreign policy.
	   Fischer's first stop Wednesday _ Paris _ stresses the importance
of French-German partnership in the European Union.
	   But beyond the usual handshake with his counterpart, Hubert
Vedrine, Fischer also was to meet with French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin. They were expected to discuss EU policy as Germany prepares
to assume the body's rotating presidency on Jan. 1, as well as the
crisis in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   Fischer's party, the environmentalists Greens, is in government
for the first time as the junior coalition partner to the
left-leaning Social Democrats. French Environment Minister
Dominique Voynet also is a Green, and the planned meeting between
the two men demonstrates just how far the former fringe party has
come in Europe.
	   Fischer has London stopover Wednesday night with no specified
agenda, although it could be intended to encourage Prime Minister
Tony Blair's efforts to bring Britain closer to the EU.
	   The new foreign minister will conclude his first official trip
in Warsaw, a gesture meant to underline Germany's continuing
commitment to forging a special bond with Poland. Having turned
France from foe to friend in the decades since World War II,
Germany has sought to repeat the process eastward with Poland since
the end of the Cold War.
	   Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski, Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek and Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek all will be meeting
with Fischer before he flies home Thursday night.

Scientology members urge Germany to end discrimination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Representatives of the Church of
Scientology appealed to the new German government Tuesday to put an
end to ``discriminatory policies'' against religious minorities.
	   The group came to Warsaw to lobby the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, which is meeting to review human rights
issues in member states.
	   At a briefing attended by a handful of OSCE delegates, U.S.
actress and Scientology spokeswoman Anne Archer said she sent an
appeal last week to Germany's newly elected chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder.
	   ``It's time for the new government to turn its back on the
discriminatory policies of the old government,'' she said.
	   Scientologists claim many of their 30,000 German members face
harassment and job discrimination.
	   Although Scientology won tax-exempt status as a church in the
United States in 1993, German officials maintain it is primarily an
economic enterprise, and have had it under surveillance as a
potential threat to democracy by domestic security agencies since
June 1997.
	   The Church of Scientology, which claims 8 million members
worldwide, was founded in 1954 by the late science fiction writer
L. Ron Hubbard.

German high court overturns Bavarian law limiting abortions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction, additional details; new statistics on
abortions performed in Bavaria &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest court Tuesday tossed
out a Bavarian law that sought to severely restrict access to
abortion in the state by limiting how much a doctor could earn from
the procedure.
	   The Constitutional Court voted 5-3 to declare the 1996 state law
unconstitutional, saying the states have not had jurisdiction to
regulate abortion since the passage of a 1995 federal law.
	   Leaders of Bavaria's conservative ruling party, the Christian
Social Union, criticized the ruling. ``Our society has lost a piece
of its values,'' said Bavarian Social Services Minister Barbara
Stamm. ``That hurts me.''
	   But others welcomed it. Renate Schmidt, head of Bavaria's
opposition Social Democrats, called the ruling ``a great success
for Bavaria's women.''
	   The Bavarian law was to have gone into effect last year but was
blocked by the high court pending its ruling.
	   The law stated that doctors in Bavaria may not derive more than
25 percent of their income from performing abortions. It also
required women to justify why they are seeking an abortion, and
stated only gynecologists could perform the procedure.
	   Bavarian leaders argued that doctors who are financially
dependent on performing abortions would be less likely to advise a
pregnant woman about other options.
	   Doctors must stress ``the protection of unborn life'' according
to a federal law requiring pre-abortion counseling. But while the
law outlaws most abortions, almost any woman can have one because
neither patients nor doctors who ignore the counseling are
punished.
	   Doctors challenging the Bavarian law charged it would only end
up inconveniencing women seeking abortions by making them travel
farther, possibly creating health risks.
	   Two doctors who together perform about 60 percent of the 12,000
abortions done in Bavaria annually also argued the law would mean
financial ruin for them.
	   The Constitutional Court agreed with the doctors that the law
breached their freedom to exercise a profession of their choice.
	   It said the state could limit abortion practices to
gynecologists, but must also come up with a transition plan that
would allow general practitioners now offering the procedure to
continue.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has approved 19 new
contracts for spare parts to help Iraq rebuild its dilapidated oil
industry, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The new contracts are worth dlrs 10.1 million and bring the
number of spare parts deals passed by the United Nations since
mid-July to 75, said John Mills.
	   The value of the signed contracts is dlrs 72.43 million, Mills
added.
	   The United Nations has permitted Iraq to spend up to dlrs 300
million to purchase equipment to boost its oil export capacity.
	   Iraqi oil officials say, however, that no spare parts have yet
reached the country.
	   Oil Minister Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid said last week that
he did not believe any would arrive before the late November end of
the current six-month phase of the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program.
	   The deal is an exemption from the U.N. trade sanctions imposed
against Iraq following Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The United Nations has approved the sale of
dlrs 5.1 million worth of Jordanian food and medicine to Iraq under
the fourth phase of an oil-for-food deal.
	   The approval allows Jordanian firms to export table salt,
detergent, soap, vegetable oil and medical equipment to Iraq, the
Ministry of Trade and Industry said Tuesday.
	   The latest U.N. approval raises to dlrs 73.5 million the value
of Jordanian exports to Iraq under the fourth six-month phase of
the oil-for-food deal.
	   Including the latest deals, dlrs 378.8 million of Jordanian
goods have been exported to Iraq since the deal began in December
1996.
	   The oil-food-food deal is an exemption to the sweeping U.N.
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The first private aviation company
has been set up in Saudi Arabia, newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The National Air Service, with a paid up capital of 60 million
riyals (dlrs 16 million) and an invested capital of 1.2 billion
riyals (dlrs 320 million), will start operations in April, the Arab
News said.
	   The airline, which will operate private charter flights, will
mostly cater to local businessmen and international companies, the
al-Eqtisadiah newspaper reported.
	   NAS will operate private internal and external charter flights
and will not compete with the national carrier Saudi Arabian
Airlines which is a major shareholder.
	   There are 10 other shareholders, including the Binladen Group
and the Mawarid group, and the company will go public in two years,
al-Eqtisadiah reported. No details were available on a breakdown
for the shares.
	   ``NAS is designed to meet the growing need for private charter
operation within and outside the kingdom and also private aircraft
ownership,'' the Arab News quoted board chairman Yousuf al-Maimani
as saying. Al-Maimani said that only foreign companies have been
providing this service in Saudi Arabia.
	   The company will be working closely with the U.S. company
Executive Jet. NAS has ordered 12 Gulfstream G-4 planes. Two of the
12-seaters will arrive in April.

EU voices support of Russian reforms, makes no new commitments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with comments by Primakov, Klima. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
received promises of European Union support Tuesday for his
government's reform efforts but no new financial commitments to
bolster the country's devastated economy.
	   Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said he hoped the second
tranche of a dlrs 10.2 billion credit line from the International
Monetary Fund can be transmitted as soon as Russia submits an
economic reform program.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
	   Primakov, substituting for ailing President Boris Yeltsin,
arrived here on a one-day visit to brief EU officials on economic
recovery plans and seek help in coping with Moscow's worst economic
crisis of the post-Soviet era.
	   But Klima and the president of the European Commission, Jacques
Santer, told him only that the EU would seek to intensify
cooperation with Russia.
	   ``The European Union underscores the need for the sustained
economic program, the improvement of the social situation'' in
Russia, Klima told reporters at a brief news conference after the
talks.
	   Russia needs to undertake ``a fast implementation of commitments
made,'' Klima said.
	   Since the crisis in Russia intensified, the Europeans have made
clear they want to see evidence that Moscow will not veer from its
economic reform program before they will commit major funding to
help restore the Russian economy.
	   Primakov recalled that in the talks, the EU leaders had
``expressed satisfaction'' with the Russian government program
approved last Saturday.
	   ``This shows that we are doing all we can to put together an
economic market with a social component attached to it,'' Primakov
said. ``You can only carry out monetarism with the population on
your side,'' he said, referring to a tight money policy.
	   Western governments and financial institutions have expressed
concern that the Russians might print large amounts of rubles to
cover expenses, thereby devaluing their currency.
	   ``We are very keen on having close links with the EU and we will
do what we can to achieve that,'' Primakov said, adding his talks
with the EU would be a ``leitmotiv'' for Russia to carry on.
	   ``We will do what we can to make sure that we can stabilize the
economic and social situation in the country,'' said Primakov.
	   Klima said that Russian and EU representatives would meet again
in Moscow in mid-December.
	   Primakov, the former foreign minister, has been prime minister
for only six weeks and has yet to produce his own blueprint to deal
with the country's deep-rooted economic problems.
	   He is, however, widely respected by all political factions and
is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when Yeltsin has
receded into the background.
	   Before leaving Moscow, Primakov held talks with Yeltsin at the
president's country residence outside of Moscow, Yeltsin's press
service said.
	   Yeltsin authorized him to tell EU officials about the
government's plan to cope with the latest economic crisis,
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Russia's economic crisis, coupled with major downturns in East
Asia and Latin America, has sent shock waves through Europe at a
time when EU governments have taken a turn to the left.
	   During their summit last weekend in Poertschach, Austria, the
EU's 15 leaders pledged to coordinate economic policies to cope
with financial crises in Russia and elsewhere.

Leading Basque party ponders coalition with support from ETA

 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Basque party that won weekend regional
elections is considering a coalition government including a group
linked to the ETA militant group, which declared a cease-fire five
weeks ago.
	   With the cease-fire still intact, Basque Nationalist Party
leader Xabier Arzalluz said Tuesday his party was considering a
coalition with other parties that favor independence from Spain.
	   He said the Basque Nationalist Party, which won 21 seats in the
75-seat regional legislature, might offer a pact with Euskal
Alkartasuna, which has six seats, and rely on outside support from
Euskal Herritarrok, a political group allied with ETA.
	   Euskal Herritarrok, which won 14 seats, is a coalition dominated
by Herri Batasuna, long recognized as the political wing of ETA.
The coalition has said it will not form part of a new government,
but could lend support on certain votes.
	   The vote Sunday was the sixth Basque regional election and the
first to held without the threat of violence following a Sept. 18
truce by ETA, which has killed nearly 800 people in its 30-year
campaign for independence.
	   The truce resulted from months of talks between Arzalluz's party
and Herri Batasuna.
	   A regional coalition made up entirely of pro-independence
parties would be the first of its kind in the Basque region since
it was given autonomous powers in 1979 following the death of
dictator Francisco Franco.
	   It would exclude the country's two main parties, steadfast in
their opposition to a split in Spanish unity: Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar's ruling center-right Popular Party and the opposition
Socialists.
	   The Popular Party placed second in the election with 16 seats,
while the Socialists took 14.
	   Arzalluz said avenues were not closed with any party. Aznar's
Popular Party and the Socialists have strongly criticized the
Nationalist Party's dealings with Herri Batasuna.
	   Both Aznar and the Socialist leaders insist Herri Batasuna and
ETA must renounce the armed campaign. Six Popular Party members
have been killed by ETA over the last three years.
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the Basque
language, has remained silent since the elections, but has said its
truce was ``solid and serious.''
	   The fact the elections resulted in no clear winner demonstrates
how deeply divided the northern region is over independence, truce
or no truce.
	   Voters gave three separatist parties a total of 41 seats and
four parties opposed to breaking up Spain 34 seats. More than 70
percent of registered voters turned out, the highest of any Basque
election.
	   The big winners were the two parties farthest apart
ideologically _ the Popular Party, which gained six new seats, and
Euskal Herritarrok which added three.
	   The moderate Nationalist Party, which has topped every one of
the region's elections, dropped only one seat and qualified to form
the government.

Greece has no `fundamental' opposition to Turkish membership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece has no ``fundamental objections''
to Turkey's membership in the European Union, but said its neighbor
still has a long way to go before it can join the group.
	   ``Greece believes that Turkey has a future in the European
family,'' it said in report given Monday to EU foreign ministers
meeting in Luxembourg.
	   The 41-page report, obtained by The Associated Press on Tuesday,
added that ``we have no fundamental objections, nor any dogmatic
opposition to the perspective of Turkey becoming a member of the
European Union.''
	   Delivered by Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, the report
contended it was Turkey's failure to meet criteria set by the EU on
issues such as democracy, the economy and human rights that was
keeping it out of the Union.
	   ``Thorough constitutional and legislative reforms and the
respect of human rights constitute the ultimate yardstick Turkey
has to comply with for the further strengthening of its ties with
the EU,'' it said.
	   But the report also contains a litany of complaints about the
issues that have divided the two NATO allies for decades, including
the disputes over the Aegean Sea that have twice brought them to
the edge of war in just over a decade .
	   It also includes a chapter on the war-divided island of Cyprus
and its bid for EU membership.
	   EU foreign ministers were discussing Cyprus' bid, along with
those of Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia and Estonia.
They are expected to join the Union sometime in the middle of the
next decade. The EU begins membership talks with these countries
next month.

Appeals court upholds prison sentence for leading Turkish activist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ An appeals court on Tuesday upheld a
one-year sentence for a leading human rights activist convicted in
July of inciting racial hatred through Kurdish propaganda.
	   Akin Birdal, recently recovered from an assassination attempt,
was put on trial for a speech he made two years ago calling for a
peaceful solution to end a war between autonomy-seeking Kurds and
government troops in southeastern Turkey.
	   It was not clear when he would begin serving the sentence.
	   Birdal is a prominent campaigner against torture and the army's
forced evacuation of Kurdish villages in southeastern Turkey. He is
head of the Human Rights Association.
	   Eleven men are on trial for his attempted assassination in May.
The defendants belong to an ultra-nationalist group and apparently
considered Birdal too sympathetic to the Kurdish rebels.
	   In another verdict on Tuesday, Birdal was acquitted of charges
of insulting the Turkish army in a speech. Prosecutors had asked
for a six-year sentence.
	   Birdal has been tried several times in the past for speeches
deemed offensive under Turkish laws. He has received suspended jail
terms but has not served any time in prison.

Cyprus, in bid to join EU, plans to free interest rates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAMZA HENDAWI &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus said Tuesday it would submit to
parliament next month legislation to liberalize its interest rates,
a key aspect in the Mediterranean island's drive to align its
economic and financial policies with European Union standards.
	   Interest rates in Cyprus have had a ceiling of 9 percent since a
law designed to combat usury came into force in 1944. Commercial
banks currently charge 8 percent for loans, while interest rates
for deposits are set at 6.5 percent.
	   Cyprus opened membership talks with the EU last March, but the
so-called ``substantive negotiations'' on its accession are due to
start next month. The government hopes to join by January 2003.
	   Tuesday's announcement came after a meeting between George
Vassiliou, the island's chief negotiator with the EU, and Finance
Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou.
	   Speaking on state radio, both men sought to allay local fears of
interest rate hikes following liberalization.
	   ``My personal assessment is that they will stay at low levels
for the next few years,'' said Vassiliou, who served as president
of Cyprus from 1988 to 1993.
	   The services-based Cyprus economy is forecast to grow by 4.7
percent this year and 4 percent in 1999, well above the EU average
of 2.8 percent and 2.6 percent respectively.
	   But both the island's fiscal deficit and public debt are in
breach of the ceilings set by the Maastricht Treaty for economic
and monetary union. The fiscal deficit is set to hit 5.7 percent of
GDP this year and shoot to 6.3 percent in 1999, more than twice the
3 percent maximum set by Maastricht, Christodoulou said.
	   The public debt, which stands at 59.8 percent of GDP, will cross
the Maastricht threshold of 60 percent in 1999 to stand at 61.7
percent of GDP.
	   Earlier this month, Christodoulou said that prospects for
further savings in public expenditure were limited and that he
would ask Parliament later this year to ratify a
four-percentage-point hike in value added tax to 12 percent.

German unions vote on merger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with unions' decisions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WUERZBURG, Germany (AP) _ Two German labor unions voted Tuesday
in favor of pursuing a merger with three others in the service
industry that would create one of the biggest unions in the world.
	   A majority of delegates at a meeting of Germany's print union,
IG-Medien, voted in the Bavarian city of Wuerzburg in favor of
talks to set up the merger.
	   In the northern city of Bremen, a union representing the banking
and insurance sectors also voted for talks.
	   Three other unions must still vote on the interim step before
talks can begin. A final vote on creating the super-union is
expected in November 1999.
	   Heated debate among delegates at the IG Medien meeting centered
around whether a bigger union will succeed in strengthening
Germany's labor movement.
	   Supporters hope the merger will help maintain labor's leverage
in an era of industry consolidation. Others questioned whether
bigger was better, and suggested the merger may make them more
unwieldy.
	   Leaders of five of Germany's service industry unions _ DAG,
OeTV, IG Medien, HBV, and DPG _ agreed in principle in February on
plans to merge by around 2000.
	   The combined group would represent nearly 4 million employees,
including clerical, transportation, education, media and postal
workers.

Leakey resigns parliamentary seat in Kenya

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Richard Leakey, the world renowned
paleoanthropologist, resigned Tuesday as a member of parliament
because his job as director of Kenya Wildlife Service is
incompatible with legislative duties.
	   ``I hand-delivered the letter to the speaker this morning
notifying him I have resigned,'' Leakey told a news conference.
	   Leakey was nominated to the 222-member parliament by his
opposition Safina party under a formula that allows all political
parties to nominate 12 legislators shared on the basis of each
party's numerical strength in the house.
	   Safina leader Paul Muite told the same news conference Kenya's
constitution does not allow the head of a public institution to
also serve as a member of parliament.
	   Muite said the party has nominated Josephine Odiro Sinyo, who is
blind, to replace Leakey, who uses artificial legs following an
aircraft accident some years ago.
	   Sinyo, who holds masters degree in law, said she will articulate
issues affecting Kenya's women and the disabled.
	   Last month, President Daniel arap Moi chose Leakey to head the
cash-strapped organization charged with the protection of wildlife
in Kenya.
	   A third-generation Kenyan of British origin, Leakey was pushed
out by Moi and other politicians in 1994 as director of KWS _ the
country's tourism asset _ in a dispute over political control of
the resource.
	   He was recalled after KWS tottered toward bankruptcy.

Israeli spiritual leader calls on party to oppose peace deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The powerful spiritual leader of an Israeli
religious party urged his followers Tuesday to reject a Mideast
peace agreement that requires Israel to hand over West Bank land to
Palestinian control.
	   Rabbi Avraham Shapira, considered the spiritual leader of the
National Religious Party and extremely influential over Jewish
settlers, ruled that it is forbidden to ``give a hand to this
horrible agreement.''
	   Many religious Jews believe that the West Bank is part of the
biblical land of Israel promised to Jews by God and that leaving it
constitutes sin.
	   As a result, the settlers and their government backers from
parties such as NRP, members of Netanyahu's coalition, oppose the
peace deal signed with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat which calls
for the transfer of 13 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians.
	   In 1995, when then-prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was moving to
withdraw Israeli troops, from Palestinian cities, settlers and
right-wing politicians demonstrated violently against the plans,
painting Rabin as a traitor. In November of that year, Rabin was
assassinated by an extremist religious Jew who opposed
land-for-peace.
	   With the third anniversary of Rabin's death approaching, calls
from those same group branding Netanyahu a traitor with blood on
his hands, stirred concern in Israel that a political killing could
come again.
	   ``I hope we won't repeat a horrible mistake,'' said President
Ezer Weizman.
	   Asked on Israel radio whether another assassination was
possible, Benny Elon, a lawmaker from the far-right Moledet party
answered ``yes, of course.''
	   Israeli media reported this week that security had been
increased for Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai after the two returned from last week's Mideast
summit outside Washington.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An Indian Air Force jet flying in
northern India lost control and plunged in a ball of flames into a
remote mountainous forest Tuesday, police and the air force said.
	   The pilot was killed in the crash and his charred body was
handed over the Air Force, the United News of India reported.
	   Rescuers had reached the area in Himachal Pradesh state, a
police officer in Shahpur, the town nearest to the village where
the plane crashed, told The Associated Press by telephone.
	   ``A village headman phoned us saying people had seen a plane
going down in the forest,'' officer Om Beer said.
	   The plane wreckage scattered over an area of 500 meters (1,650
feet) but did not cause any damage to property on the ground.
	   Air Force spokesman Squadron Leader R.K. Dhingra said in New
Delhi the plane was a single-seater Mig-21.
	   The plane crashed deep inside in a dense forest a four-kilometer
(two- mile) walk from the nearest road, the officer said.
	   Few other details were available.

Islamic court chairman kidnapped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen kidnapped a
chairman of an Islamic court on his way to the mosque for morning
prayers in southern Mogadishu, witnesses said Tuesday.
	   Also Tuesday another unidentified group detonated an explosive
devise outside a court of a joint administration recently
established by faction leaders.
	   Sheik Omar Maalim Nur, chairman of Shirklole Islamic Court
affiliated with the administration, was ordered to board a pickup
truck by the gunmen, neighbors said.
	   They said the gunmen, who did not fire a shot, then sped in the
direction of the Bermuda Triangle, a dangerous central Mogadishu
neighborhood.
	   Soon after the kidnapping became known court officials were seen
preparing trucks mounted with weapons and militiamen to attempt a
rescue.
	   The Shirklole court has in recent months handed stiff sentences
to gunmen for robberies and the Nur's kidnappers are believed to
aim at avenging convicted colleagues.
	   There were no casualties reported in the explosion, which was
heard downtown Mogadishu, but the blast shuttered window panes.
	   About five males in a pick-up truck planted the explosive devise
outside the court and fled as the exchanged shots with militiamen
on guard.
	   No injuries on either side were reported.
	   No group had yet claimed responsibility for the kidnapping or
the blast.
	   Somalia has had no functioning central government since the 1991
ouster of the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and the country's
disintegration into fiefs protected by militias.

Dethroned Miss Croatia might go to World contest

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ There are tears and happy endings,
dramatic twists and turns, frauds, politics and beautiful women.
But it's not a new Latin American soap opera that has captured
Croats' attention _ it's the Miss Croatia beauty contest.
	   The latest episode: Lejla Sehovic, a Muslim who was crowned Miss
Croatia on Oct. 11, only to have her title revoked amid a national
scandal weeks later, might be bound for this year's Miss World
pageant after all.
	   ``The situation is changing by hour, but I will likely travel to
Seychelles,'' Sehovic, 22, told Zagreb's Radio 101 Tuesday.
	   Sehovic was replaced in a second round of voting, after media
reports that some Croatians, as well as organizers of the event
could not stand to have a Muslim representing Croatia. Her
replacement, Ivana Petkovic, is a Croatian with no Muslim heritage.
	   Sehovic, media and some human rights organizations insisted that
she was ousted just because she's a Muslim.
	   The organizer of the Miss Croatia pageant, Milan Seckovic, has
denied any political implications claiming the re-vote was
necessary because the first round was irregular. Late Monday, he
told Croatian media that he would nevertheless suggest Sehovic to
go to Seychelles, while Petkovic would go next year.
	   It was not immediately clear whether he succumbed to public
pressure, or he was just trying to avoid Sehovic's lawsuits.
	   Sehovic, said she would make a final decision later in the day.
	   Croatia, a predominantly Catholic country of 4.7 million people
with a small Muslim population, supported Bosnian Croats who fought
Muslims for control of the western part of Bosnia in 1993-94.
Relations between the two nations remain tense.
	   The beauty contest is highly popular among Croats in previous
years as an event that draws them away from daily burdens: war, low
wages and politics.

IMF team to visit Belarus next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ An International Monetary Fund mission is
scheduled to arrive in Belarus next week for talks on a possible
loan, a spokesman for the fund said Tuesday.
	   The delegation arrives Monday for 11 days of talks with
government officials, said Yulia Lyskova, a spokeswoman for the IMF
office in Minsk, the Belarusian capital.
	   She said the IMF officials would consider Belarus' request for a
loan, but wouldn't comment on its size.
	   Belarus' contacts with international lenders have been extremely
rare in recent years, since the West has been sharply critical of
President Alexander Lukashenko's Soviet-style economic course and
his crackdown on dissent and free media.
	   Most enterprises in this former Soviet republic remain in state
hands and the government controls most prices.
	   Belarus heavily depends on Russia, its main energy supplier and
the leading export market, and has been hit hard by the Russian
economic crisis.

Municipal polls expected to renew Khatami's mandate for reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ After being outfoxed in a national vote for
a powerful clerical assembly, allies of Iran's moderate president
are turning to upcoming city and town elections to try to push
forward his reforms.
	   Supporters of President Mohammad Khatami said Tuesday that since
a hard-line council will not have to approve candidates _ as it did
in last week's balloting _ moderates will stand a better chance in
the elections in Iran's 10,000 municipalities.
	   A victory could serve as an endorsement of Khatami and create a
broad constituency of local officials who support his efforts to
open up the country.
	   ``The vote will be a chance for Mr. Khatami to fulfill his
pledge to the people to draw them into the political arena,'' said
Majid Ansari, a moderate member of Parliament.
	   The election, which on Monday were scheduled for Feb. 26, could
be the next big battle in the running conflict between
conservatives and moderates fought out since Khatami was elected in
May last year.
	   At every step, hard-liners have battled Khatami's efforts to
grant more freedom to the press and the arts and reduce Islamic
strictures on average people _ all reforms that have gained Khatami
widespread public support.
	   In last Friday's elections for the Assembly of Experts, the
moderates were trounced, gaining only 13 seats on the 86-seat
assembly _ compared to 54 for the conservatives.
	   The assembly appoints and oversees the country's supreme leader,
and Khatami's allies had hoped to use it to curb the growing powers
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader who in effect has
the final say in political decisions.
	   The moderates blamed their poor showing on the Council of
Guardians, the body dominated by conservatives which vetted the
candidates and dumped most progressive theologians by paring the
list from 396 to 167.
	   In the municipal elections, candidates will not have to be
clerics or sit for a test on the Shiite Islam dominant in Iran. The
Interior Ministry will be in charge of approving the 200,000 who
will run among the expected 800,000 applicants.
	   ``The local elections are very important. The criteria for
running are much easier. Candidates are ordinary people. They don't
have to be experts on religion,'' Mohammad Sadeq Husseini, adviser
to the information minister, told The Associated Press.
	   Ansari, the moderate lawmaker who squeaked through to a seat on
the Assembly of Experts, predicted that the president's backers
will ``achieve noticeable victory ... God willing.''
	   The moderates also are hoping the municipal elections will
produce a huge turnout similar to that which gave Khatami his own
victory _ in effect, an endorsement of the president.
	   In last year's presidential vote, 30 million of Iran's 38.5
million voters cast ballots, 20 million of them for the moderate
cleric Khatami.
	   By contrast, only 18 million voters turned out last week, and
many Iranians said they had boycotted the vote because the Council
of Experts had destroyed any real competition.
	   In the municipal elections, candidates must be over 24, literate
and residents for at least one year in the constituency where they
run. In announcing the election Monday, the Interior Ministry said
registration of candidates will be from Dec. 28 to Jan. 3.

Archaeologist makes largest Islamic find in Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An archaeologist announced Tuesday he had
discovered the largest collection of objects ever found in Israel
from the Islamic period in jars stashed away by a merchant 1,000
years ago.
	   Between 500 and 600 metallic objects, including decorative jugs,
pots, bowls and bells, were discovered in three large clay jars,
two of which were hidden beneath the shopkeeper's floor near the
Sea of Galilee.
	   ``It's incredible treasure from around A.D. 1,000, a period from
which we don't have many pieces, especially metal, so it's unique
in every sense,'' said Hebrew University professor Yizhar
Hirschfeld, director of the excavation site just south of the
Israeli city of Tiberias.
	   Workers found the first container in the corner of what they
believe to be an ancient store floor last Thursday then discovered
the others after digging through the floor Monday.
	   Several bowls ingrained with ancient Kufic Arabic script, a
large candelabra and snake and bird figurines were among the items
found. ``The amount, beauty and quality of the artistic work is
incredible,'' Hirschfeld said.
	   The find will help archaeologists to better understand trade
relations and artistic expression of the era, Hirschfeld said.
	   At the time these objects were made _ between the 10th and 11th
century _ Tiberias was a thriving Islamic capital with a mixed
Muslim, Jewish and Christian population.
	   Hirschfeld believes the store owner was Christian because
crosses, coins and medallions bearing Jesus' likeness were among
the objects found.
	   Why he needed to hide his treasure remains a mystery, Hirschfeld
said.
	   The objects will eventually be displayed at Hebrew University
and the Israel Museum, both in Jerusalem.

Former Mr. Europe notes dangers past and present for EU
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The main architect of today's European Union said
Tuesday the 15-nation union is past the danger point of failing,
but that it must reform quickly or turn into a ``loose
confederation.''
	   Jacques Delors, former head of the EU's executive European
Commission, said time is running out to revamp the EU subsidies and
power structure before taking on new members from Eastern Europe.
	   Unless Brussels does it in the next three years, ``enlargement
will lead inevitably lead to a loose confederation,'' he told a
group of reporters.
	   ``The hardest part for Europe has passed,'' said the former
``Mr. Europe,'' who headed the European Commission from 1985-95.
``If the adversaries of Europe had a chance, it was the years
93-95. I was afraid for Europe then.''
	   With high unemployment and recession at the time, ``it's almost
a quasi-miracle during that time that the anti-Europeans didn't
succeed in turning France away from Europe,'' he said.
	   If asked 10 years ago whether the euro single currency would
take place by the end of the century, ``I would have said `surely
not,' '' Delors said.
	   The euro takes effect among 11 EU nations at the end of the
year.
	   Now, however, France and other EU countries are still struggling
with unemployment. ``In the world today, it's the one that reforms
the quickest that is the winner. The slowest is the loser,'' he
told the Anglo-American Press Association.
	   Delors saw as a hopeful sign the call by EU leaders at their
summit in Austria last weekend for a common social policy to fight
unemployment.
	   ``We must think together about the means to keep the financial
crisis from ruining or diminishing the chances of that path of
durable development,'' he said.
	   ``I never liked that stability plan,'' he said, referring to the
so-called Stability Pact that fines members for violating the
euro's economic guidelines.
	   To deal with the world's financial crisis, Delors backed a
proposed ``economic security council'' to create ``a minimum of
regulation on a world level.''
	   ``We have to be architects and not just firefighters,'' he said.
	   The council should include the Group of Seven leading
industrialized countries plus other nations around the world, said
Delors, 73, who now heads his own foundation called ``Our Europe.''
	   On defense, Delors chided France for not rejoining NATO's
integrated command it left in 1966. If Paris wants the European
defense pillar, ``she must fully integrate into NATO.''
	   He also welcomed the weekend call by British Prime Minister Tony
Blair for a greater European defense role.
	   ``The United States can't do everything,'' he said. ``At least
we'll stop writing communiques while we wait for the United States
to do the dirty work.''

<TEXT>
	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces scrambled Tuesday
to meet a NATO deadline for pulling back in Kosovo, and hundreds of
people returned to their homes here for the first time in months
now that most of the police and soldiers have gone.
	   Private radio station B-92 quoted Serb sources as saying the
withdrawal was complete and that government forces in Kosovo were
back to the level before Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched his crackdown against ethnic Albanian militants on Feb.
28.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday
reports from the field indicated that Milosevic was in
``substantial compliance'' with terms of the Kosovo peace
agreement.
	   ``Well over 90 percent of the security force reinforcements''
have been withdrawn, major road blocks have been dismantled and
heavy weapons have been returned to garrison, Lockhart said. ``As
we see this substantial compliance, we also need to make sure that
coming into compliance isn't the only issue. We need to send the
message that he needs to stay in compliance.''
	   The 16-nation NATO alliance had threatened to launch airstrikes
unless Milosevic halts his crackdown and cuts his forces to levels
in place before the conflict began.
	   NATO ambassadors were to meet later Tuesday in Brussels,
Belgium, hours before the 1900 GMT deadline for Milosevic to
comply.
	   In Belgrade, the special U.S. mediator for Kosovo, Christopher
Hill, said the United States hoped Serb moves ``will reduce the
violence substantially.''
	   ``We also hope this reconfiguration, moving around of forces,
will help resolve the issue of the displaced... people who are
afraid to come back to their villages,'' Hill added.
	   Hill's comments appeared to indicate that the United States was
pushing Milosevic not only to draw down his forces in the province
but was also dictating where the remaining troops could be
stationed.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, the overseas spokesman of the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, Bardhyl Mahmuti, called the
Yugoslav troop movements nothing more than an ``illusion'' of
actual withdrawals. Ethnic Albanians had been urging NATO to strike
Serb forces to change the balance of power in the conflict.
	   Evidence of the Serb withdrawal Tuesday included the abandoned
Komorane checkpoint outside Pristina and signs of more movement
among villagers.
	   In Malisevo, a former rebel stronghold 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina, hundreds of ethnic Albanians filled the
streets on Tuesday morning, revisiting for the first time the homes
and shops they abandoned when Serb forces overran the town July 28.
	   Osman Mazreku said he fled to nearby Belanica village on July 28
with his wife, mother and three children. His father chose to
remain behind, was arrested by police and has not been seen since,
according to Mazreku.
	   ``He said `I'm old and they won't do anything to me,' '' Mazreku
said. ``I was afraid something like this would happen but he was
determined'' to stay.
	   The top floor of Mazreku's two-story house had been gutted by
fire, and clothing and garbage were strewn across the ground floor.
	   ``I'm sorry to see my house in this condition, but I'm happy to
be alive,'' he said. ``That's all that matters. I hope they'll let
me live here now.''
	   But no one planned to stay the night or bring their families
back until police vacated a building on edge of the village. As if
to underscore the uncertainty, the streets emptied after a short
burst of automatic rifle fire when a small convoy of armored police
vehicles arrived to reinforce the police presence at the building.
	   Serb police said the shots came from somewhere in the village
but they did not return the fire. About three kilometers (1.5
miles) north of the town, uniformed KLA guerrillas inspected
bunkers vacated by departing Serb police and found a grenade tied
to a tree with a trip wire set as a booby trap.
	   Such threats prevent most of remaining displaced people in
Kosovo from returning home. But many have come out of the
wilderness because of the approaching winter to stay with friends
and relatives in safe towns, said U.N. refugee official Kris
Janowski. He put the number of people still living in the woods at
about 10,000.
	   ``It's not an ideal situation but it's not a situation where
we'll see people starving or freezing to death,'' Janowski said.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and
most want independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 have been driven from
their homes in seven months of fighting since Milosevic launched
the crackdown.
	   As the withdrawal accelerated, Kosovo's Serb governor, Veljko
Odalovic, thanked the police for ``bringing peace to Kosovo'' and
pledged the province will be defended from ethnic Albanian
``terrorists'' with or without the police.

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Hamburg police chief Ernst Uhrlau, an
expert on Germany's neo-Nazi scene, has been tapped to become
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's top security and intelligence aide,
city officials said Tuesday.
	   The 51-year-old Social Democrat replaces Bernd Schmidbauer, who
held the office under former Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The position
in the chancellery coordinates activities of the federal
government's and the military spy agencies.
	   Uhrlau headed Hamburg's branch of the federal agency charged
with monitoring extremist groups from 1991 until 1996, when he
became police chief.

Iran's local elections expected to renew Khatami's mandate for
</HEADLINE>
reforms &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ After being outfoxed in a national vote for
a powerful clerical assembly, allies of Iran's moderate president
are turning to upcoming city and town elections to try to push for
reform.
	   Supporters of President Mohammad Khatami said Tuesday that since
a hard-line council will not have to approve candidates _ as it did
in last week's balloting _ moderates will stand a better chance in
the elections in Iran's 10,000 municipalities.
	   A victory could serve as an endorsement of Khatami and create a
broad constituency of local officials who support his drive to open
up the country.
	   ``The vote will be a chance for Mr. Khatami to fulfill his
pledge to the people to draw them into the political arena,'' said
Majid Ansari, a moderate member of Parliament.
	   The election, which on Monday were scheduled for Feb. 26, could
be the next big battle in the running conflict between
conservatives and moderates fought out since Khatami was elected in
May 1997.
	   At every step, hard-liners have battled Khatami's efforts to
grant more freedom to the press and the arts and reduce Islamic
strictures on average people _ all reforms that have gained Khatami
widespread public support.
	   In last Friday's elections for the Assembly of Experts, the
moderates were trounced, gaining only 13 seats on the 86-seat
assembly _ compared to 54 for the conservatives.
	   The assembly appoints and oversees the country's supreme leader,
and Khatami's allies had hoped to use it to curb the growing powers
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader who in effect has
the final say in political decisions.
	   Moderates blamed their poor showing on the Council of Guardians,
the body dominated by conservatives which vetted the candidates and
dumped most progressive theologians by paring the list from 396 to
167.
	   In the municipal elections, candidates will not have to be
clerics or sit for a test on the Shiite Islam dominant in Iran. The
Interior Ministry will be in charge of approving the 200,000 who
will run among the expected 800,000 applicants.
	   ``The local elections are very important. The criteria for
running are much easier. Candidates are ordinary people. They don't
have to be experts on religion,'' Mohammad Sadeq Husseini, adviser
to the information minister, told The Associated Press.
	   Ansari, the moderate lawmaker who squeaked through to a seat on
the Assembly of Experts, predicted that the president's backers
will ``achieve noticeable victory ... God willing.''
	   The moderates also are hoping the municipal elections will
produce a huge turnout similar to that which gave Khatami his own
victory _ in effect, an endorsement of the president.
	   In last year's presidential vote, 30 million of Iran's 38.5
million voters cast ballots, 20 million of them for the moderate
cleric Khatami.
	   By contrast, only 18 million voters turned out last week, and
many Iranians said they had boycotted the vote because the Council
of Experts had destroyed any real competition.
	   In the municipal elections, candidates must be over 24, literate
and residents for at least one year in the constituency where they
run. In announcing the election Monday, the Interior Ministry said
registration of candidates will be from Dec. 28 to Jan. 3.

England meets Rest of the World as Villa faces Chelsea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The foreign invasion of British soccer goes on and
on.
	   The latest import is a Brazilian who plays for an amateur club
in Wales. Rangers and Celtic, Scotland's most powerful teams, have
barely a Scot on their starting lineups.
	   Meanwhile, up at the top of English soccer, Aston Villa's two
games against Chelsea this week have the look of England vs. the
Rest of the World.
	   The arrival of Jose Ricardo Rodriguez Ferreita, a 20-year-old
Brazilian striker known as ``Junior,'' at the last-place Welsh club
Rhayader is unlikely to create major problems for the League of
Wales. Because it's an amateur club, Rhayader can't afford to pay
him and the Brazilian is on a tourist visa anyway.
	   While the influx of foreign players goes on unabated in England,
however, the English Football Association has a difficult line to
follow.
	   The FA is happy to see the Premier League and other domestic
divisions strengthened by the arrival of big foreign stars. But it
doesn't want the national team to be weakened because English
players can't get on the starting lineups of their clubs.
	   At the start of the season, more than 170 overseas players were
in the Premier League and that figure is rising.
	   If 20-year-old Junior impresses in Wales, he might be the target
for big English clubs such as Chelsea, which already has so many
foreigners the English players can't get into the team.
	   Chelsea's Italian manager Gianluca Vialli, who could even field
himself against the Villa at Stamford Bridge, has the chance to
field three Englishmen, defender Michael Duberry and midfielders
Graeme Le Saux and Dennis Wise.
	   But he could send out a lineup made up entirely of non-British
players against an all-English Villa roster, substitutes included.
	   Vialli could field a Dutchman, goalkeeper Ed de Goey; two
Frenchmen, Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf; four Italians,
himself, Gianfranco Zola, Roberto Di Matteo and Pierluigi
Casiraghi; Nigerian defender Celestine Babayarol; Norwegian striker
Tore Andre Flo; Danish striker Brian Laudrup, and Uruguayan
midfielder Gustavo Poyet.
	   If Villa manager John Gregory continues to leave Australian
goalkeeper Mark Bosnich out because of a lingering injury, his
entire starting lineup and five substitutes will be English.
	   Although it may just be coincidence that all his players are
English, Gregory's policy appears to be working.
	   Sticking with much the same lineup for the first quarter of the
season, Gregory has guided his unbeaten team to top spot in the
Premier League and Villa leads the league by four points.
	   This week's games against Chelsea could be decisive.
	   Wednesday's game at Stamford Bridge is in the League Cup and the
loser will be ousted, while Saturday's match is a Premier League
game and a Chelsea win could cut Villa's advantage to one point.

Pakistani man on trial as leader of human smuggling ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT AN DER ODER, Germany (AP)_ A Pakistani flea-market
trader accused of smuggling hundreds of people into Germany went on
trial Tuesday in eastern Germany.
	   Azhar Mahmordizz, 33, is accused of masterminding a ring that
smuggled 263 foreigners into Germany in 23 separate groups from
December 1994 to May 1996.
	   The people _ from Pakistan, India, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Jamaica,
Afghanistan, Turkey, Lebanon and Bangladesh _ paid U.S. dlrs 600
each to be smuggled into Germany, said state prosecutor Manfred
Berthold. They traveled via Uzbekistan, Belarus, Russia, Lithuania
and Poland, often suffering cramped living and transport quarters
on the way, he added.
	   Most were arrested by border guards shortly after entering
Germany. Some drowned crossing the Oder and Neisse rivers, the
natural border between Germany and Poland.
	   Mahmordizz, who ran a textiles stall in a Warsaw flea market,
was arrested in Poland in 1996 and handed over to German
authorities.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ One day after being sworn in as foreign
minister, Joschka Fischer will begin trips to Paris, London and
Warsaw, getting a quick start on the new government's key theme of
continuity in foreign policy.
	   Fischer's first stop Wednesday _ Paris _ stresses the importance
of French-German partnership in the European Union.
	   Beyond the usual handshake with his counterpart, Hubert Vedrine,
Fischer also was to meet with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
They were expected to discuss EU policy, as Germany prepares to
assume the body's rotating presidency on Jan. 1, and the crisis in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   Fischer's party, the environmentalists Greens, is in government
for the first time, as the junior coalition partner to the
left-leaning Social Democrats. French Environment Minister
Dominique Voynet also is a Green, and the planned meeting between
the two men demonstrates just how far the former fringe party has
come in Europe.
	   Fischer has a London stopover Wednesday night with no specified
agenda, although it could be intended to encourage Prime Minister
Tony Blair's efforts to bring Britain closer to the EU.
	   The new foreign minister will conclude his first official trip
in Warsaw, a gesture meant to underline Germany's continuing
commitment to forging a special bond with Poland. Having turned
France from foe to friend in the decades since World War II,
Germany has sought to repeat the process eastward with Poland since
the end of the Cold War.
	   Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski, Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek and Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek all will be meeting
with Fischer before he flies home Thursday night.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The Foreign Office on Tuesday advised Britons
against non-essential travel to Chile due to the ``volatile
situation'' there following the detention in London of former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   British citizens in Chile have been told to keep ``a low
profile'' following ``isolated incidents of abuse and physical
assaults on persons mistakenly identified as British,'' the Foreign
Office said in a statement.
	   Also Tuesday, it emerged that two Chilean admirals canceled a
trip to buy British warships to protest Pinochet's arrest, and four
Chilean exiles who say they were tortured by the former dictator's
secret police launched a legal bid to have him tried in Britain.
	   In the High Court, on the final day of a two-day case to get
Pinochet released immediately, lawyers for a Spanish magistrate
seeking his extradition on charges of murder, torture and
kidnapping argued that, under international law, Pinochet is liable
to stand trial for human rights abuses committed during his
17-year-rule.

Archaeologist makes largest Islamic find in Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli archaeologist announced Tuesday he
had discovered the largest collection of objects ever found in
Israel from the Islamic period in jars stashed away by a merchant
1,000 years ago.
	   Between 500 and 600 metallic objects, including decorative jugs,
pots, bowls and bells, were discovered in three large clay jars,
two of which were hidden beneath the shop near the Sea of Galilee.
	   ``It's incredible treasure from around A.D. 1,000, a period from
which we don't have many pieces, especially metal, so it's unique
in every sense,'' said Hebrew University professor Yizhar
Hirschfeld, director of the excavation site just south of the
Israeli city of Tiberias.
	   Workers found the first container in the corner of what they
believe to be an ancient store last Thursday then discovered the
others after digging through the floor Monday.
	   Several bowls ingrained with ancient Kufic Arabic script, a
large candelabra and snake and bird figurines were among the items
found. ``The amount, beauty and quality of the artistic work is
incredible,'' Hirschfeld said.
	   The find will help archaeologists to better understand trade
relations and artistic expression of the era, Hirschfeld said.
	   At the time these objects were made _ between the 10th and 11th
century _ Tiberias was a thriving Islamic capital with a mixed
Muslim, Jewish and Christian population.
	   Hirschfeld believes the store owner was Christian because
crosses, coins and medallions bearing Jesus' likeness were among
the objects found.
	   Why he needed to hide his treasure remains a mystery, Hirschfeld
said.
	   The objects will eventually be displayed at Hebrew University
and the Israel Museum, both in Jerusalem.

IMF team to visit Belarus next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ An International Monetary Fund mission is
scheduled to arrive in Belarus next week for talks on a possible
loan, a spokesman for the fund said Tuesday.
	   The delegation arrives Monday for 11 days of talks with
government officials, said Yulia Lyskova, a spokeswoman for the IMF
office in Minsk, the Belarusian capital.
	   She said the IMF officials would consider Belarus' request for a
loan, but wouldn't comment on its size.
	   Belarus' contacts with international lenders have been extremely
rare in recent years, since the West has been sharply critical of
President Alexander Lukashenko's Soviet-style economic course and
his crackdown on dissent and free media.
	   Most enterprises in this former Soviet republic remain in state
hands and the government controls most prices.
	   Belarus heavily depends on Russia, its main energy supplier and
the leading export market, and has been hit hard by the Russian
economic crisis.

Congo peace talks on verge of collapse on second day

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Two days of talks to hammer out a
cease-fire in Congo were on the verge of collapse Tuesday after
Congolese rebels, excluded from the meeting, demanded face-to-face
talks with Congolese officials.
	   Rebel leader Bizima Karaha told reporters his fighters would not
agree to a cease-fire proposal drafted for the meeting by African
and U.N. officials unless his delegation met directly with the
delegation representing Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   He said Congolese Foreign Minister Jean Charles Okoto, aides and
Congo's military allies still refused to meet the rebel delegation
at the Lusaka hotel where they are gathered.
	   ``We can't have a situation where they put us in one place and
have a conference in another place. We must have direct
negotiations,'' he said.
	   Zambian officials said the meeting of foreign and defense
ministers from 12 African nations were demanding countries with
troops in the Congo admit to it. The meeting was held behind closed
doors.
	   Kabila has claimed Rwandan troops are fighting alongside the
rebels in Congo, but Rwandan officials stood by their earlier
denials that this was so, Zambian officials said.
	   If Rwanda fails to convince the delegations about its role in
Congo, the cease-fire talks would be suspended.
	   Earlier, Zambia's President Frederick Chiluba intervened to try
to jar loose the deadlock.
	   Chiluba called the Rwandan and Ugandan foreign ministers to his
official residence after acrimonious exchanges between them and
Congolese officials and their allies, officials said. No details
were released.
	   Uganda also reportedly backs the rebels and has troops in
eastern Congo. Uganda says its forces are there to attack
Congo-based Ugandan rebels.
	   The talks are the latest effort to bring a cease-fire to the
three-month civil war in the vast central African country, which
has drawn in Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and reportedly Sudan
on the government's side. Rwanda and Uganda favor the rebels.
	   Congolese Foreign Minister Jean Charles Okoto told reporters
Rwandan and Ugandan troops must ``move out of Congo.''
	   ``If nothing conclusive comes out on this, we will continue
fighting,'' he said.
	   Okoto also described Karaha, the rebel leader, as ``a terrorist.
He needs to be arrested immediately.''

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Richard Leakey, the world-renowned
paleontologist, resigned Tuesday from parliament, saying his job as
director of Kenya's wildlife services is incompatible with
legislative duties.
	   Last month, President Daniel arap Moi chose Leakey to head the
cash-strapped organization, which is charged with the protection of
wildlife in the east African country.
	   A third-generation Kenyan of British origin, Leakey was pushed
out by Moi in 1994 as head of the same wildlife program _ which
oversees the country's chief tourism asset _ in a dispute over
political control.
	   Leakey told a news conference Tuesday that he ``hand-delivered
the letter to the speaker this morning notifying him I have
resigned.''
	   Leakey had been nominated to the 222-member parliament by his
opposition Safina Party.
	   Safina leader Paul Muite said the party has nominated Josephine
Odiro Sinyo, who is blind, to replace Leakey, who uses artificial
legs since an aircraft accident some years ago.
	   Sinyo, who holds masters degree in law, said she will articulate
issues affecting Kenya's women and the disabled.

Croatia, Bosnian federation initial accord on special ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ After yearlong talks and arguments, the
leaders of Croatia and the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation
initialed an agreement Tuesday, defining bilateral relations.
	   The agreement is to be made public on Wednesday and officials
refused to reveal its contents.
	   Richard Sklar, U.S. special envoy for Bosnian-Croatian
relations, mediated the negotiations. He said was ``happy to see
that parties have come together to a constructive agreement.''
	   ``The security, the political stability and the economics of the
region are linked and when the leadership of the countries of the
region ... find ways to work together, the people are the winners''
Sklar told reporters.
	   It was not clear, however, whether the agreement achieved
anything significant apart from bringing together the two sides
that have been mostly at odds since the Bosnian war ended in 1995.
	   Jacques Klein, a top international official in Bosnia welcomed
the agreement and said talks on annexes, to specify ways of
military cooperation, economics and trade, should start immediately
afterwards. These issues are reportedly source of continued
disputes.
	   The agreement should regulate relations between Croatia and the
Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation that makes up 51 percent of the
country. The other half is controlled by Bosnian Serbs.
	   Relations between the Bosnia's Muslims and Croats have been
uneasy since they fought each other in 1993-94. Croatia aided the
Bosnian Croats throughout the Bosnian war and international
observers blame Zagreb for continued control over the Bosnian
Croat-held regions.
	   Zagreb is still largely financing Bosnian Croats and President
Franjo Tudjman is considered their chief decision-maker. Tudjman
argues that Croatia should take care of its compatriots in Bosnia,
but international officials accuse him of harboring dreams to annex
a part of Bosnia to Croatia proper.
	   The ``special relationship'' agreement should end such an
uncontrolled aid, and define forms in which Croatia can help its
proxies, while not violating the integrity of Bosnian state.
	   Ivic Pasalic, a close aide to Tudjman, said the agreement paves
the way for Croatia ``to provide more help to Bosnian Croats, but

	   Another agreement, on Bosnia's use of Croatian port of Ploce,
has also been under negotiations for years. The two agreements are
to be signed in early December.

In sign of thaw, Mauritanian foreign minister visits Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A visit by the foreign minister of the North
African country of Mauritania was seen by Israel Tuesday as a
possible thaw in relations between the Jewish state and the Arab
world.
	   A senior Israeli foreign ministry official linked the two-day
visit of Sheik El-Afia Wil'd Mohammed Khouna to the new peace
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians negotiated at Wye
Plantation in Maryland last week.
	   ``It's a consequence of the Wye Plantation agreement,'' David
Dadonn told The Associated Press. ``We hope this will be a signal
for more.''
	   After the first peace agreements were signed by Israel and the
Palestinians in 1993 and 1995, several Arab countries established
low-level ties with Israel. However, the contacts were frozen when
the peace talks entered a 17-month stalemate under Israel's
hard-line leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Israel and Mauritania established interest offices, the lowest
level of relations, in November 1995.
	   Israel has similar relations with Qatar and Oman. Tunisia and
Morocco have slightly higher relations, Dadonn said.
	   Egypt is the only North African country that has full diplomatic
relations with Israel.
	   Khouna arrived in Israel Monday and was scheduled to meet with
Israeli President Ezer Weizman Tuesday. Khouna's agenda includes
meetings with Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, and Dan
Tichon, the speaker of Israel's parliament as well as a visit to
Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial.

Serb forces redeploy in Kosovo as NATO deadline nears

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces scrambled Tuesday
to meet a NATO deadline for pulling back in Kosovo, and hundreds of
ethnic Albanians returned to their homes for the first time in
months.
	   Private radio station B-92 quoted Serb sources as saying the
withdrawal was complete and that government forces in Kosovo were
back to the level before Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched his crackdown against ethnic Albanian militants on Feb.
28.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday
that reports from the field indicated Milosevic was in
``substantial compliance'' with terms of the Kosovo peace
agreement.
	   ``Well over 90 percent of the security force reinforcements''
have been withdrawn, major road blocks have been dismantled and
heavy weapons have been returned to garrison, Lockhart said. ``As
we see this substantial compliance, we also need to make sure that
coming into compliance isn't the only issue. We need to send the
message that he needs to stay in compliance.''
	   Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 have been driven from
their homes in fighting since Milosevic sent in troops to crack
down on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and
most want independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The 16-nation NATO alliance has threatened to launch airstrikes
unless Milosevic halts his crackdown and cuts his forces to levels
in place before the conflict began.
	   NATO ambassadors were to meet Tuesday in Brussels, Belgium,
prior to the 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) deadline for Milosevic to
comply.
	   In Belgrade, the special U.S. mediator for Kosovo, Christopher
Hill, said reports from the field indicated ``substantial
movement,'' but he stopped short of declaring the withdrawal
complete.
	   ``There is an effort to reconfigure the security forces in a way
that we truly hope will reduce the violence substantially,'' Hill
said. ``We also hope this ... moving around of forces, will help
resolve the issue of the displaced ... people who are afraid to
come back to their villages.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, speaking in a BBC
interview, warned NATO should not drop its guard despite ``serious
progress'' by Milosevic. ``He still has some way to go and it may
well be wise for us to keep that threat hanging over him,'' Cook
said.
	   In Geneva, a spokesman for the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army, Bardhyl Mahmuti, called the Yugoslav troop movements nothing
more than an ``illusion.'' Ethnic Albanians maintain the government
troops are withdrawing only temporarily and want NATO to strike.
	   Evidence of the Serb withdrawal included the abandoned Komorane
checkpoint outside Pristina and signs of more movement among
villagers.
	   In Malisevo, a former rebel stronghold 30 miles (50 kilometers)
southwest of Pristina, hundreds of ethnic Albanians filled the
streets Tuesday, visiting homes and shops they abandoned when Serb
forces overran the town in July.
	   As if to underscore the uncertainty of the situation, the crowds
disappeared after a few bursts of automatic gunfire rang out when a
small convoy of armored police vehicles rolled into town.
	   Serb police said the shots came from somewhere in the village
and they did not return fire. About a mile (kilometer) north of
town, uniformed guerrillas inspected bunkers vacated by departing
Serb police and found a grenade tied to a tree, with a trip wire
set as a booby trap.
	   Such threats prevent most of the remaining displaced people in
Kosovo from returning home. But many have come out of the
wilderness because of the approaching winter to stay with friends
and relatives in safe towns, said U.N. refugee official Kris
Janowski. He said about 10,000 people remain in the woods.
	   In Malisevo, villager Osman Mazreku said he fled to a nearby
town nearly three months ago with his wife, mother and three
children. His elderly father stayed behind, was arrested by police
and has not been seen since, Mazreku said.
	   ``He said 'I'm old and they won't do anything to me,''' Mazreku
said. ``I was afraid something like this would happen.''
	   The top floor of the family's two-story house had been gutted by
flames. Clothing, valuables and garbage were strewn across the
ground floor.
	   ``I'm sorry to see my house in this condition, but I'm happy to
be alive,'' he said. ``I hope they'll let me live here.''
	   As the withdrawal accelerated, Kosovo's Serb governor, Veljko
Odalovic, thanked the police for ``bringing peace to Kosovo'' and
pledged the province will be defended from ethnic Albanian
``terrorists'' with or without the police.

German lawyer says out of court deal possible on Nazi slave

 &UR; By HARRY LUCK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A Munich lawyer fighting to get payments
for former Nazi slave laborers said Tuesday that he has offered to
hold new talks with banks, industry leaders and Jewish groups to
try to reach a deal acceptable to all.
	   Attorney Michael Witti said he was willing to discuss a
settlement that satisfies the demands of the victims as well as
offers legal security for German firms. But he said he had yet to
get a response to his offer.
	   Witti, who works with New York-based lawyer Ed Fagan
representing Holocaust victims, has been critical of German
industry and bank plans thus far to repay slave laborers.
	   They have filed a lawsuit in New York against Siemens,
Volkswagen, Krupp, Daimler-Benz, Audi and BMW, seeking a portion of
company profits for thousands of former slave laborers.
	   ``A solution will and must be found that includes the pending
court case,'' Witti said.
	   A planned trip by Fagan to Germany this week has been canceled
to prevent that endangering new talks.
	   Ignatz Bubis, the chairman of Germany's Central Council of Jews,
has accused Fagan of hindering talks toward a settlement by
pursuing separate legal action.
	   Germany's newly elected Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder last week
invited German business leaders to private talks aimed at setting
up a new foundation to resolve the slave labor claims and protect
German firms against future lawsuits.

Municipal polls expected to renew Khatami's mandate for reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CHANGES in 3rd graf to show elections first since 1979
revolution and in 10th graf to show whom winners would replace. &QL; 
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ After being outfoxed in a national vote for
a powerful clerical assembly, allies of Iran's moderate president
are turning to upcoming city and town elections to try to push
forward his reforms.
	   Supporters of President Mohammad Khatami said Tuesday that since
a hard-line council will not have to approve candidates _ as it did
in last week's balloting _ moderates will stand a better chance in
the elections in Iran's 10,000 municipalities.
	   A victory in these elections, the first such vote since the 1979
Islamic revolution, could serve as an endorsement of Khatami and
create a broad constituency of local officials who support his
efforts to open up the country.
	   ``The vote will be a chance for Mr. Khatami to fulfill his
pledge to the people to draw them into the political arena,'' said
Majid Ansari, a moderate member of Parliament.
	   The election, which on Monday were scheduled for Feb. 26, could
be the next big battle in the running conflict between
conservatives and moderates fought out since Khatami was elected in
May last year.
	   At every step, hard-liners have battled Khatami's efforts to
grant more freedom to the press and the arts and reduce Islamic
strictures on average people _ all reforms that have gained Khatami
widespread public support.
	   In last Friday's elections for the Assembly of Experts, the
moderates were trounced, gaining only 13 seats on the 86-seat
assembly _ compared to 54 for the conservatives.
	   The assembly appoints and oversees the country's supreme leader,
and Khatami's allies had hoped to use it to curb the growing powers
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader who in effect has
the final say in political decisions.
	   The moderates blamed their poor showing on the Council of
Guardians, the body dominated by conservatives which vetted the
candidates and dumped most progressive theologians by paring the
list from 396 to 167.
	   In the municipal elections, candidates will not have to be
clerics or sit for a test on the Shiite Islam dominant in Iran. The
Interior Ministry will be in charge of approving the 200,000 who
will run among the expected 800,000 applicants. The winners will
replace officials left over from the Shah's time or appointees.
	   ``The local elections are very important. The criteria for
running are much easier. Candidates are ordinary people. They don't
have to be experts on religion,'' Mohammad Sadeq Husseini, adviser
to the information minister, told The Associated Press.
	   Ansari, the moderate lawmaker who squeaked through to a seat on
the Assembly of Experts, predicted that the president's backers
will ``achieve noticeable victory ... God willing.''
	   The moderates also are hoping the municipal elections will
produce a huge turnout similar to that which gave Khatami his own
victory _ in effect, an endorsement of the president.
	   In last year's presidential vote, 30 million of Iran's 38.5
million voters cast ballots, 20 million of them for the moderate
cleric Khatami.
	   By contrast, only 18 million voters turned out last week, and
many Iranians said they had boycotted the vote because the Council
of Experts had destroyed any real competition.
	   In the municipal elections, candidates must be over 24, literate
and residents for at least one year in the constituency where they
run. In announcing the election Monday, the Interior Ministry said
registration of candidates will be from Dec. 28 to Jan. 3.

German unions vote to pursue merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WUERZBURG, Germany (AP) _ Two German labor unions voted Tuesday
in favor of pursuing a merger with three others in the service
industry that would create one of the biggest unions in the world.
	   A majority of delegates at a meeting of Germany's print union,
IG-Medien, voted in the Bavarian city of Wuerzburg in favor of
talks to set up the merger.
	   In the northern city of Bremen, a union representing the banking
and insurance sectors also voted for talks.
	   Three other unions must still vote on the interim step before
talks can begin. A final vote on creating the super-union is
expected in November 1999.
	   Heated debate among delegates at the IG Medien meeting centered
around whether a bigger union will succeed in strengthening
Germany's labor movement.
	   Supporters hope the merger will help maintain labor's leverage
in an era of industry consolidation. Others questioned whether
bigger was better, and suggested the merger may make them more
unwieldy.
	   Leaders of five of Germany's service industry unions _ DAG,
OeTV, IG Medien, HBV, and DPG _ agreed in principle in February on
plans to merge by around 2000.
	   The combined group would represent nearly 4 million employees,
including clerical, transportation, education, media and postal
workers.

Oil paintings to doodles: legacy of an affair with Picasso
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated after auction at about 2300 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ When a love affair goes sour, some destroy the
evidence. Others save everything: goofy postcards, tiny drawings on
matchbooks, a doodle on a restaurant menu.
	   Luckily, Dora Maar, muse to Pablo Picasso for eight stormy
years, kept all those things and more _ from grand oil paintings to
a paper scrap with her lover's bloodstain.
	   On Tuesday, 15 months after Maar's lonely death, art-lovers got
a chance to buy a piece of that passionate treasure trove. The
three-day auction _ said to be the largest group of Picasso works
to go on the block _ is conservatively estimated to bring in dlrs
30 million, and likely much more.
	   But it is the deeply personal, slice-of-life nature of the
collection that has had Parisians standing in the rain to get a
pre-auction glimpse at the Maison de la Chimie near the Eiffel
Tower.
	   Dora Maar was 29, the dark-haired daughter of a Yugoslav
architect and a French mother, when she met Picasso in 1936. She
quickly became his lover and also a model, particularly for
``Guernica.''
	   But in the 1940s, Picasso moved on to the younger Francoise
Gilot, and Maar went into a tailspin, living a hermetic existence
in her apartment on the Rue de Savoie, never even seeing her close
friends.
	   She died in solitude in July 1997 at age 89. She had never
married, had no heirs, apparently left no will.
	   But genealogists tracked down two distant relatives, both of
whom had never even heard of Maar. Now, after 60 percent of the
proceeds go to the government for taxes, they'll get much of the
remaining 40 percent.
	   Some of Maar's friends aren't happy.
	   ``Dora would be just horrified at all this,'' said James Lord,
one of her close friends in Paris, though in the last few years
they only exchanged letters.
	   ``All this stuff was so personal to her,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``It's rather morbid to have it up for sale.''
	   The French government has deemed some of the works _ like a set
of whimsical paper cut-outs made for his daughter, Maya, including
animal heads with cigarette holes for eyes _ a ``collection,''
meaning they can't be taken from France. That may hold some prices
down.
	   It also has reached a deal with the heirs under which some of
the inheritance taxes will be paid with artworks _ such as a 1915
pencil drawing of Max Jacob, Picasso's first friend in Paris.
	   The big ticket-items are the 10 oil paintings, including seven
of Dora herself. There is the 1936 ``Dora Maar on the Beach,'' with
Dora in red lipstick and nails, hair blowing in the wind. There is
the 1937 ``The Crying Woman (Study for Guernica)'' _ in which her
eyes are turned into tears pierced with long pins.
	   And then there is the stunning ``Dora Maar with Green Nails,''
also from 1936, where the muse is at the height of her style, her
chin resting on green nails, hair braided on top of her head.
	   But the most fascinating objects are the smallest: little
portraits of Dora made into jewelry; little instruments made from
the silver wrapping around a wine cork; dozens of sketches on tiny
matchbook covers; photographs of the dashing Picasso at all ages;
original books, notes, postcards, and letters.
	   Nothing, it seems, was too small or insignificant for Picasso to
scrawl on. One matchbook says: ``It was so dark at noon that the
stars could be seen.'' A restaurant menu is adorned with a
whimsical animal head.
	   And perhaps the oddest but most poignant item from this lover's
cache: a scrap of paper with a brownish stain, and the scrawled
words, ``Blood of Picasso.''

Greece has no `fundamental' opposition to Turkish membership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece has no ``fundamental objections''
to Turkey's membership in the European Union, but said its rival
still has a long way to go before it can join the group.
	   ``Greece believes that Turkey has a future in the European
family,'' Greece's foreign minister said Monday in a report given
to an EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg.
	   The two NATO allies have been divided over Aegean Sea disputes
that have brought them to the edge of war twice in the last decade.
	   In the 41-page report, obtained by The Associated Press on
Tuesday, Greece said that ``we have no fundamental objections, nor
any dogmatic opposition to ... Turkey becoming a member of the
European Union.''
	   Delivered by Greece's foreign minister, Theodoros Pangalos, the
report blamed Turkey's failure to meet EU criteria on issues such
as democracy, the economy and human rights for keeping it out of
the Union.
	   ``Thorough constitutional and legislative reforms and the
respect of human rights constitute the ultimate yardstick Turkey
has to comply with for the further strengthening of its ties with
the EU,'' it said.
	   The report also includes a chapter on the war-divided island of
Cyprus and its bid for EU membership.
	   EU foreign ministers were discussing Cyprus' bid, along with
those of Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia and Estonia,
who are expected to join the Union in the next decade. The EU
begins membership talks with these countries next month.

Peace talks in Guinea-Bissau postponed over venue dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Efforts to end the conflict in
Guinea-Bissau suffered a setback Tuesday when a meeting between the
West African nation's warring factions was called off, news reports
said.
	   The country's President and the former army chief seeking to
oust him were due to meet Tuesday for their first face-to-face
talks since the military rebellion erupted June 7.
	   But President Joao Bernardo Vieira and Brig. Ansumane Mane
called the meeting off because they were unable to agree on a
venue, Portuguese state radio Antena 1 reported.
	   They later rescheduled their planned meeting for Wednesday in
Gambia, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of Guinea-Bissau,
the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported, citing government
sources.
	   The insurgents could not confirm that the Gambia talks would
take place, Lusa said.
	   The ambassadors of Portugal, France and Sweden were behind the
latest effort to bring the foes together.
	   Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama told reporters in Lisbon
that Vieira and Mane would abide by a cease-fire until the talks
were held.
	   A truce had been in place since July 26 but fighting restarted
10 days ago, deepening the plight of some 500,000 displaced people
in the country of 1 million.
	   The breakaway military faction controls most of the country.
Government forces, constituted mainly of troops from neighboring
Senegal, are pinned in the capital Bissau.
	   Senegalese soldiers turned back the first aid trucks sent to
reach displaced people in Prabis, a small town near Bissau, World
Food Program spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said Tuesday in
Geneva.
	   The three-truck convoy had to return to Bissau because the
soldiers said it lacked the necessary authorization.
	   Some 70,000 to 100,000 people in Prabis have not received any
supplies since Oct. 18, Berthiaume said.
	   Guinea-Bissau, wedged between Senegal and the Republic of
Guinea, is one of the world's poorest countries, with an average
annual income of about dlrs 250 per capita in 1997.

Canadian prime minister cancels planned visit to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Prime Minister Jean Chretien has canceled a
planned trip to Russia in January because of economic troubles
there, his office announced Tuesday.
	   The trip already had been scaled back from a full-scale trade
mission that would have included hundreds of Canadian executives.
	   ``In consultation with President (Boris) Yeltsin, I have decided
to postpone my visit to Russia in light of the current economic
situation,'' Chretien said in a release.
	   He still plans to visit Poland and Ukraine in January, his
office said.

Slobodan Milosevic sacks security chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic sacked his secret service chief Tuesday following reports
that the official opposed his hardline policies, including the
Kosovo crackdown.
	   Jovica Stanisic was replaced by police Gen. Radomir Markovic,
according to a statement by the Serbian government, controlled by
Milosevic. Stanisic had also been a security adviser to Milosevic.
	   Independent B-92 radio said a session of Milosevic's ruling
Socialist Party was underway and may result in more purges of
reported pro-reformists within party ranks.
	   Independent media have recently reported that Stanisic was
against excessive use of force against ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo. He reportedly also led a faction within the government
which objected to Milosevic's cooperation with ultranationalists
led by deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj.
	   During Milosevic's decade-long rule, Stanisic was the key aide,
crucial for keeping his grip on power intact.
	   His replacement indicated that the hardliners were winning over
the reformists within the government. Milosevic has used a threat
of NATO attacks against military targets in Yugoslavia to crackdown
on his opponents at home. Reported purges indicated he moved
against the critics among his aides.
	   Stanisic is also believed to have been a key figure in arming
Bosnian Serbs and Croatian Serbs whose armed rebellions led to the
breakup of the former Yugoslav federation.
	   In 1995, Stanisic helped win the release of hundreds of United
Nations peace keepers were taken hostage by Bosnian Serbs to stave
off NATO attacks on their positions.
	   Stanisic was reportedly in favor of recognizing an opposition
victory at elections in Nov. 1996. Annulling of the victory led to
three months of street protests that shook Milosevic's rule.
	   Stanisic reportedly also spoke against the recent media
crackdown in Serbia.

 &UR; Calls for revenge after West Bank slayings; suspects arrested &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Showing resolve to keep their side of the new
peace agreement with Israel, Palestinian security forces on Tuesday
arrested two Palestinian suspects in the grisly killing of a Jewish
settler in the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   A roadside stone memorial set up settlers Tuesday in the spot
where 29-year-old Danny Vargas was dumped from his car by his
killers a day before bore the inscription ``avenge the blood.''
	   In a second funeral Tuesday, some 3,000 Palestinians buried an
elderly Palestinian, Mohammed Zalout, who was bludgeoned to death a
day before near a Jewish settlement of Itamar in the northern West
Bank, apparently by an Israeli extremist.
	   The crowd chanted ``revenge, revenge,'' and the Israeli army
declared Palestinian towns in the West Bank off-limits to Israelis,
apparently because of concern about possible revenge attacks.
	   Despite the latest violence, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said he was determined to withdraw troops from 13 percent of the
West Bank over the next 12 weeks, as promised.
	   ``The only thing that can prevent the implementation of the
agreement is if the (Israeli) Cabinet does not approve it, or if
the Palestinians do not fulfill it,'' Netanyahu said.
	   However, Netanyahu was evasive when asked whether he would
freeze a withdrawal if parliament passes an early elections bill
that was approved Monday for a first reading by parliament.
	   Israeli media speculated Tuesday that Netanyahu might try to
discourage the dovish opposition from backing the bill by declaring
that in the event of early elections he would suspend the pullback.
	   Netanyahu said he would not relate to the possibility of spring
elections because he hoped ``it will not happen.''
	   The most vocal critics of Netanyahu have been Jewish settlers
and their representatives in parliament. At Vargas' open grave,
politicians and friends delivering eulogies demanded that Netanyahu
go back on his promise to withdraw from West Bank land.
	   ``You promised us peace and security, and we have neither,''
said legislator Rehavam Zeevi from the far-right opposition party
Moledet, referring to Netanyahu. His speech was punctuated by
shouts of ``wage war'' by some of the mourners.
	   Monday's two killings put the new peace agreement to a first
test. A centerpiece of the agreement is a pledge by the
Palestinians to work harder to rein in militants.
	   Demonstrating a new attitude, Palestinian security forces who
had suspended cooperation with Israel for most of the past 17
months on Tuesday arrested two Hebron men in the Vargas killing.
	   Ahmed Tibi, a spokesman for Arafat, said one of the men was
suspected of having shot Vargas and the other of having been an
accomplice.
	   The two suspects also confessed to killing a Jewish seminary
student earlier this month near the communal farm of Ora south of
Jerusalem, Tibi said.
	   Israel army radio identified the main suspect as Jamal Jadallah
and said he denied he had any ties to the Islamic militant group
Hamas, the main opponent to peace with Israel.
	   Despite the new cooperation, Israeli troops reacted harshly to
the Vargas killing, clamping a curfew on the downtown area of
Hebron they control and sealing the city so Palestinians could not
leave or enter.
	   The curfew barred some 30,000 Palestinians from leaving their
homes. During the crackdown, troops entered a girls' elementary
school and ordered the students, some of them crying, to go home.
	   Since August, downtown Hebron residents have already been under
curfew twice for a total of three weeks, and the new restrictions
embittered many Palestinians.
	   ``We thought that we could now go to Gaza, but we cannot even
leave our homes,'' said Khalil Jaberi, 26, referring to a provision
in the accord for a new land route for Palestinians between the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.

NATO reviews airstrike threat after Serbs pull back in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ As Serb troops redeployed in Kosovo to
meet international demands, NATO ambassadors met to decide whether
to lift or extend the threat of allied airstrikes beyond the
deadline of 1900 GMT Tuesday.
	   Reports from Kosovo suggested President Slobodan Milosevic had
made a significant pullback of his military and police forces in
the province to avert NATO intervention.
	   But as NATO's policy-making North Atlantic Council started talks
2 1/2 hours ahead of the deadline, officials at alliance
headquarters said it was unclear if Milosevic had done enough to
get the airstrike threat lifted.
	   Alliance officials said the Serb withdrawal made airstrikes very
unlikely, but added that NATO was not expected to remove the threat
completely.
	   Instead, the council of ambassadors from the 16 NATO nations was
seen either setting a new deadline for complete compliance, or
extending indefinitely the ``activation order'' which is keeping
some 400 allied warplanes on alert for possible raids against the
Serbs.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a BBC interview
that NATO should not yet drop its guard despite ``serious
progress'' made by Milosevic toward meeting international demands.
	   ``He still has some way to go and it may well be wise for us to
keep that threat hanging over him,'' Cook said.
	   Convoys of tanks and trucks carrying Yugoslav troops and police
pulled out of several parts of Kosovo Tuesday, indicating Milosevic
had ordered compliance with international demands he reduce Serb
forces in Kosovo to levels before the conflict with ethnic Albanian
separatists flared February.
	   In Washington, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said
Milosevic had withdrawn ``well over 90 percent of the security
force reinforcements.''
	   ``Thanks to NATO pressure and determination, very substantial
steps have been taken toward compliance,'' Lockhard added.
	   The private Yugoslav radio station B-92 quoted Serb sources as
saying the withdrawal was complete and that government forces in
Kosovo were back to pre-conflict levels. A representative of the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army also confirmed the withdrawal,
although he expressed concern about it's long-term impact.
	   The NATO ambassadors were studying reports from international
observers on the ground in Kosovo and NATO military, who are
operating unarmed observer flights over the province as part of the
Oct. 12 agreement between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   NATO sources said the ambassadors would likely wait until
shortly before the deadline to declare whether Milosevic met the
conditions.

Oil paintings to doodles: legacy of an affair with Picasso
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS graf 17, `Nothing, it seems...' to describe sketch on
menu. Will be updated after auction at about 2300 GMT &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ When a love affair goes sour, some destroy the
evidence. Others save everything: goofy postcards, tiny drawings on
matchbooks, a doodle on a restaurant menu.
	   Luckily, Dora Maar, muse to Pablo Picasso for eight stormy
years, kept all those things and more _ from grand oil paintings to
a paper scrap with her lover's bloodstain.
	   On Tuesday, 15 months after Maar's lonely death, art-lovers got
a chance to buy a piece of that passionate treasure trove. The
three-day auction _ said to be the largest group of Picasso works
to go on the block _ is conservatively estimated to bring in dlrs
30 million, and likely much more.
	   But it is the deeply personal, slice-of-life nature of the
collection that has had Parisians standing in the rain to get a
pre-auction glimpse at the Maison de la Chimie near the Eiffel
Tower.
	   Dora Maar was 29, the dark-haired daughter of a Yugoslav
architect and a French mother, when she met Picasso in 1936. She
quickly became his lover and also a model, particularly for
``Guernica.''
	   But in the 1940s, Picasso moved on to the younger Francoise
Gilot, and Maar went into a tailspin, living a hermetic existence
in her apartment on the Rue de Savoie, never even seeing her close
friends.
	   She died in solitude in July 1997 at age 89. She had never
married, had no heirs, apparently left no will.
	   But genealogists tracked down two distant relatives, both of
whom had never even heard of Maar. Now, after 60 percent of the
proceeds go to the government for taxes, they'll get much of the
remaining 40 percent.
	   Some of Maar's friends aren't happy.
	   ``Dora would be just horrified at all this,'' said James Lord,
one of her close friends in Paris, though in the last few years
they only exchanged letters.
	   ``All this stuff was so personal to her,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``It's rather morbid to have it up for sale.''
	   The French government has deemed some of the works _ like a set
of whimsical paper cut-outs made for his daughter, Maya, including
animal heads with cigarette holes for eyes _ a ``collection,''
meaning they can't be taken from France. That may hold some prices
down.
	   It also has reached a deal with the heirs under which some of
the inheritance taxes will be paid with artworks _ such as a 1915
pencil drawing of Max Jacob, Picasso's first friend in Paris.
	   The big ticket-items are the 10 oil paintings, including seven
of Dora herself. There is the 1936 ``Dora Maar on the Beach,'' with
Dora in red lipstick and nails, hair blowing in the wind. There is
the 1937 ``The Crying Woman (Study for Guernica)'' _ in which her
eyes are turned into tears pierced with long pins.
	   And then there is the stunning ``Dora Maar with Green Nails,''
also from 1936, where the muse is at the height of her style, her
chin resting on green nails, hair braided on top of her head.
	   But the most fascinating objects are the smallest: little
portraits of Dora made into jewelry; little instruments made from
the silver wrapping around a wine cork; dozens of sketches on tiny
matchbook covers; photographs of the dashing Picasso at all ages;
original books, notes, postcards, and letters.
	   Nothing, it seems, was too small or insignificant for Picasso to
scrawl on. One matchbook says: ``It was so dark at noon that the
stars could be seen.'' A restaurant menu is adorned with a
whimsical self-portrait of the artist.
	   And perhaps the oddest but most poignant item from this lover's
cache: a scrap of paper with a brownish stain, and the scrawled
words, ``Blood of Picasso.''

Police arrest man suspected of robbing wife of U.S. diplomat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police arrested a man
suspected of hijacking a car belonging to the wife of a U.S.
diplomat in Belgrade, a police statement said Tuesday.
	   On August 31, at a traffic light, a man had jumped into the car
driven by Mrs Sharon Miles, wife of the U.S. charge d'affaires in
Yugoslavia, pointed a gun at her head and hijacked the vehicle.
	   Out of the city center, the assailant had ordered Mrs Miles to
get out of the BMW which had diplomatic license plates and drove
away.
	   Two days later, police found the somewhat damaged BMW and
returned it to the U.S. Embassy. They told reporters they had
identified a suspect and were searching for him.
	   On Tuesday, Serbian police said they arrested one Predrag
Lejlic, 22, of Resnik, a Belgrade suburb, and charged him with
robbery.
	   The suspect, a former convict, had been released from prison in
July, police said.

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A woman who fled her central Kosovo
home during violence in July returned Tuesday to find the body of
her father, who had disappeared.
	   Shqipe Krasniqi, 36, said she identified the remains of her
father, Jashar, by his watch, clothes and shoes.
	   The remains were mostly bones found in the family house on the
outskirts of Malisevo, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Pristina. An Associated Press photographer saw the remains.
	   Krasniqi said two other bodies also were found in the area
Tuesday, and both were believed to be members of her clan that goes
by the Krasniqi surname.
	   Serb police overran Malisevo on July 28 and occupied the village
until Monday, when most police pulled out. Villagers visited their
homes on Tuesday for the first time, but said they would continue
sleeping at the homes of relatives and friends in other areas until
a police outpost in Malisevo is dismantled.

Milosevic refuses to back down on media crackdown

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from head of independent media association,
another daily shuts down due to phone threats to chief editor &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic is
refusing to back down on his ongoing purge of Serbia's fledgling
independent media, a special U.S. envoy said Tuesday.
	   Speaking to representatives of independent Serbian media, U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill promised he would further press the issue
with the autocratic Yugoslav president when he meets him later
Tuesday.
	   ``I assure you I have raised the issue at the highest level here
very forcefully,'' Hill told reporters. ``I am sorry to say... we
don't seem to have ... results.''
	   Last week, Serbian parliament passed a new media law, severely
restricting press freedoms and instituting sky-high fines for those
publishing ``anti-patriotic'' and ``anti-government'' stories.
	   ``You can not wipe out independent media any more than you can
deprive people of oxygen,'' Hill said, adding the new law was
``something not in keeping with the standards of Europe and the
rest of the international community.''
	   ``It is a 19th century means, not worthy even of the Ottoman
empire,'' Hill said, referring to Serbia's longtime enemy, the
Ottoman Turks.
	   Veran Matic, of a Belgrade-based association of independent
media, handed Hill his association's plans for fighting the new
law, warning peace in Kosovo was not possible without free media in
Serbia.
	   Also on Tuesday, another independent daily, NT Plus, halted
publication following telephone threats to its chief editor,
Momcilo Djogovic.
	   ``The new media law has turned into a widespread lynching of
journalists,'' Djogovic said, adding his newspaper would not appear
on the stands under these ``absurd conditions.''

Argentine president arrives in Britain for reconciliation visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Carlos Menem arrived in Britain on Tuesday for a
six-day visit _ the first by an Argentine president since the two
countries went to war in 1982 over the Falkland Islands.
	   Menem's jet landed at London's Heathrow Airport with the
Argentine flag and Britain's Union Jack flying outside the cockpit.
	   On Wednesday, Menem was scheduled to attend a reconciliation
service at St. Paul's Cathedral and lay a wreath for the 970 people
killed in the Falklands War _ 255 of them British soldiers.
	   Britain won the skirmish over the windswept archipelago in the
south Atlantic in 74 days.
	   During his visit, Menem also is scheduled to meet with Prime
Minister Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth II.
	   Both the Argentine and British governments have stressed that
Menem's visit is one for reconciliation, not recrimination.
	   In the House of Commons on Tuesday, British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said Britons ``should recall that President Menem played
no part in the government of Argentina with whom we were at war two
decades ago.
	   ``President Menem at the time was in prison, where he was held
for five years and tortured under that same regime. The fact that
he is the president of Argentina shows how far it has come,'' Cook
said.
	   Menem's first scheduled engagement was a working breakfast
Wednesday with British business leaders, as part of his drive to
attract investment to Argentina.
	   He has brought 100 of Argentine's top business leaders with him
in an attempt to boost commercial relations between the two
countries.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Japan trounced Taiwan 134-6 on Tuesday in the
last round of Asian qualifying play for next year's Rugby World Cup
finals, making them the overwhelming favorite to represent the
region for a fourth consecutive year.
	   But Hong Kong's 20-11 victory over South Korea kept their slim
chances of advancing to the 20-nations finals in Wales alive. They
will have to defeat the heavily favored Japanese on the last day's
play Saturday, however, to earn them the berth.
	   Only the group winner among the four teams is certain to advance
to the World Cup finals next year, though the runner-up will have a
second chance in a repechage tournament.
	   Japan, which beat South Korea 40-12 in their first qualifying
match on Oct. 24, scored 20 tries in their monumental victory over
Taiwan.
	   It was the third highest winning score in Rugby World Cup
history. Leading Japan's effort was winger Terunori Masuho with
five tries, while flyhalf Keiji Hirose kicked a perfect 10 for 10
conversions.
	   Hong Kong upset the South Koreans, pulling back from a four
point deficit at halftime with a determined effort in the second 40
minutes.
	   Mark Solomon's one try and Isi Tuivai's two penalty goals and
one conversion gave Hong Kong the win.

Americans warned to be cautious ahead of deadline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo
advised Tuesday all Americans to defer unnecessary travel to the
Bosnian Serb half of the state ahead of the expiring NATO deadline
given to neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic was given until 1900GMT
Tuesday to meet international demands, including cessation of
fighting and withdrawal of special police and army forces from the
Southern Serbian Kosovo province.
	   In the case the deadline requirements are not met, Yugoslavia
could face military action.
	   Western diplomats fear eventual NATO airstrikes could trigger
retaliation against international staff both in Yugoslavia and in
the Serb half of Bosnia.
	   The Tuesday travel advisory also warned all U.S. officials who
are currently in the Bosnian Serb Republic to closely monitor media
reports and prepare ``to leave on very short notice.''

Brazil's jobless rate dips slightly in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The number of Brazilians out of
work dipped slightly last month to 7.7 percent from 7.8 percent in
August, the government statistics office IBGE said Tuesday.
	   Most of the new jobs were in the service sector, the institute
said.
	   The average monthly salary for legally registered workers was
677 reals, or about dlrs 574, while self-employed workers earned an
average of 572 reals, or dlrs 485, the institute said.
	   Although the jobless rate has stabilized in recent months, it
still is way above the 5.6 percent of September, 1997. In the first
nine months, unemployment averaged 7.8 percent, compared to 5.8
percent in the same period last year.
	   Unemployment rose after the Asian market crisis of last October,
when Brazil's Central Bank sharply raised interest rates to protect
its currency. Consumers bought less, and the slow sales led
factories and stores to lay off workers.
	   After interest rates fell through most of this year, a new
crisis led the Central Bank to raise them again last month to
nearly 50 percent.
	   Private institutes contest the IBGE's methods and claim the real
jobless rate is much higher. The union statistics department Dieese
calculates that unemployment in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city,
is 18.5 percent of the work force.

Minister says France could request Pinochet extradition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's justice minister said Tuesday she would
ask Britain to extradite former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet if such a step is deemed ``necessary and possible.''
	   On Monday, a lawyer representing three French families whose
relatives disappeared in Chile after Pinochet took power in 1973
filed a complaint with a French court, asking for Pinochet's
extradition to face charges of crimes against humanity.
	   ``If the magistrate decides that extradition is possible, I will
immediately transmit this demand to British authorities,''
Elisabeth Guigou told the French National Assembly in response to a
question.
	   British police arrested Pinochet Oct. 16 at a London clinic
where he had undergone back surgery. A Spanish magistrate is
seeking his extradition on charges of genocide, torture and
terrorism during his 17-year rule, which ended in 1990.
	   On Monday, Swiss authorities also requested Pinochet's arrest,
following a criminal complaint filed last week in Geneva by the
widow of a student who disappeared in May 1977.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia asked NATO on Tuesday to revoke its threat
of airstrikes against Yugoslavia, saying that deployment of
international observers to Kosovo province means a peaceful
settlement there is possible.
	   ``There is no alternative to a non-violent settlement of the
Kosovo problem,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   A United Nations resolution ``gives the green light to launching
an OSCE mission, therefore continuing the process of a peaceful,
political settlement,'' said the statement quoted by the Interfax
news agency.
	   Observers under the command of the 54-country Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe are to see whether Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic is complying with a NATO demand to
pull back his forces before a 1900 GMT deadline Tuesday.
	   Milosevic has made a significant last-minute pullback of his
military and police forces from Kosovo, whose mainly ethnic
Albanian population wants independence.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry also praised Moscow's role in averting
airstrikes so far. Russia adamantly opposes the use of force
against Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, with which it
shares Slavic and Orthodox religious roots.
	   ``Russia has maintained a firm and resolute position,'' the
statement said. ``The most important thing has been accomplished:
All clauses directly or indirectly sanctioning automatic use of
force in spite of the priorities of the Security Council, bypassing
the U.N. Charter, have been scrapped.''
	   The deputy speaker of the lower house of parliament, Sergei
Baburin, also hailed the developments as Russia's ``return to big
politics,'' Interfax reported.
	   The world ``forgot the Russia that says `No,' and the memory has
to be refreshed,'' Baburin said.
	   He criticized NATO's continued threat of airstrikes as ``an
unprecedented attempt to trample on international norms,'' the
ITAR-Tass news agency quoted him as saying.
	   Baburin also said that the Duma would recommend that Russia
would defy U.N. economic sanctions on Yugoslavia and provide the
country with weapons if NATO attacks. ``In the face of a true
attempt upon the world order, Russia must say its weighty word,''
he said.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev, meanwhile, said that
Russia would try to prevent any attempts by ethnic Albanian
separatists to disrupt the peace process, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.

Tanzanian student dies of malaria in Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A Tanzanian student has died of
malaria in a Romanian hospital, a Health Ministry official said
Tuesday.
	   Atif Tijani, 28, who was studying medicine in Constanta, died
Monday in a hospital at the Black Sea port, 225 kilometers (141
miles) east of Bucharest.
	   Dr. Daniela Pitigoi, a senior official at the ministry, said
that Tijani had fallen ill earlier this month after he returned to
Romania to start his fifth year of studies.
	   ``He neglected the illness at first, thinking it was a cold,''
said Pitigoi by telephone. She said every year some 20 cases of
malaria are reported, all of them contracted outside Romania.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed
reports Tuesday that Serb forces are drawing down in Kosovo in
accordance with Security Council demands.

resolution is something that we will know later today.''
	   NATO ambassadors were meeting in Brussels to determine whether

Countries in transition trade tips on privatization
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) _ European nations undergoing transition
to free market economies wrapped up a conference on privatization
of formerly state-owned enterprises Tuesday, advocating expediency
as the best formula for success.
	   ``With the benefit of hindsight, our biggest mistake was perhaps
going too slow,'' said Roman Ceska, the head of the Czech
Republic's privatization fund.
	   Speaking at the 13-nation conference in this ancient walled city
on behalf of one of the most efficiently reforming economies of the
former communist bloc, Ceska said that in the long run, hesitation
can be more costly than even settling for an inferior bid.
	   Commenting on his own country's experience, especially in the
banking sector, Ceska said that governments need courage.
	   ``A fear of watching helplessly as firms went bankrupt only
prolonged their death and forestalled potential restructuring of
firms by new investors,'' he said.
	   Ceska also recommended governments drop their guard against
multinational corporations, as they are usually followed by
competitors in the same field instead of growing into monopolies.
	   ``Without multinational companies there cannot be any real long
term competitiveness,'' Ceska said.
	   Hungary, which has already seen some 80 percent of its socially
owned assets transfer into private hands, echoed the Czech lead.
The Hungarians said that a transparent and dependable legal
framework was key to attracting more than two-thirds of its total
revenue from foreign investors.
	   Hungary has drawn more than 11.9 dlrs billion since it began
privatizing state assets in 1989, said Arpad Sipos, who heads the
Hungarian privatization commission. The largest investors from
abroad came from Germany, with 27.1 percent, and the United States,
with 15.5 percent.
	   Bosnia, which has yet to embark on privatization due to a
destructive war from 1993-95, took careful note of the experiences
as it prepared to put smaller public assets for sale in the coming
year. So far it had only begun privatizing the housing sector.
	   Alongside host Croatia, ten other former communist nations took
part in presenting their national models at the two-day forum.
	   Many of the participating nations have yet to offer crown jewels
like telecommunication networks, oil and gas industries and other
utilities up for grabs, content to wait for better social
conditions or higher bids.

International officials agree to attend Dec. 4-5 donor conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia has apparently made enough
progress in facilitating the return of its Serb refugees that
international officials agreed Tuesday to attend a donors'
conference Dec. 4-5.
	   At the conference, Croatia hopes to raise foreign funds for its
post-war reconstruction and the return of refugees.
	   Earlier this year, international officials suspended their
participation in the conference because of Croatia's reluctance to
accept an unconditional and swift return of Serb refugees.
	   Since then, ``there has been some very positive steps'' in the
implementation of the refugee return program, a statement from the
group composed of foreign ambassadors accredited in Croatia, the
U.N. refugee agency and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe said.
	   However, they emphasized that there were also ``areas where
increased action is needed,'' particularly ``to eliminate
discrimination impeding refugee return'' and help with the
restitution of property.
	   After meeting Premier Matesa, the international officials said
they received assurances that the government would work to solve
outstanding problems.
	   Up to 200,000 Serbs fled Croatia in 1995 when government forces
recaptured territories the Serbs seized during the 1991 war. So
far, about 45,000 of them have returned.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British-Chilean relations deteriorated further
Tuesday as Britain advised its citizens to avoid ``non-essential''
travel to Chile, saying anti-British feeling is ``running high''
since former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet was arrested in
London.
	   Earlier, two Chilean admirals called off a trip to buy British
warships to protest Pinochet's detention Oct. 16 on a Spanish
warrant alleging he was responsible for murders, torture and
kidnappings during his 17-year rule.
	   Adding to the growing claims against Pinochet, four Chilean
exiles who say they were tortured by his secret police launched a
legal bid to have him tried in Britain.
	   In a High Court hearing on Pinochet's application for immediate
release, lawyers wound up 1 1/2 days of complex legal argument,
with a ruling expected Wednesday afternoon.
	   Lawyers representing Spanish prosecutors argued that under
international law, Pinochet is liable to stand trial for human
rights abuses committed while he was in office.
	   Abuses committed by a ruler are not ``something that is in the
furtherance of his function as head of state,'' said lawyer Alun
Jones, who also represents British prosecutors.
	   Jones alleges Pinochet was responsible for up to 4,000 murders,
including at least one in the United States, and had sent agents to
Spain to ``seek out and kill'' political opponents there.
	   Lawyers for the 82-year-old Pinochet, who is under guard in a
London hospital, contended the Spanish warrant was illegal both
because former heads of state cannot be prosecuted for actions
committed in their ``official capacity'' and because he is not
Spanish.
	   But speaking in Parliament, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said
the government was right not to intervene to overturn the warrant.
	   ``Due process of law must be carried out and it must not be
warped to fit anybody's political agenda,'' he said.
	   In its travel advisory, the Foreign Office called the situation
in Chile ``volatile'' and warned of isolated attacks on people
``mistakenly identified as British.''
	   British nationals and British commercial interests could become
``targets of mob violence,'' it cautioned, and Britons should
``keep a low profile.''
	   The British Defense Ministry said the Chilean admirals had
called off a trip to negotiate the possible purchase of three
surplus Type 22 frigates from the Royal Navy.
	   The visit was ``felt by the Chileans to be inappropriate in the
circumstances,'' a Defense Ministry spokesman told the AP, speaking
anonymously.
	   The four Chilean exiles, three of whom live in Britain, fear
Britain's Labor Party government will release Pinochet on
humanitarian grounds. Right-wing Chilean senators who visited him
at the London clinic where he underwent back surgery Oct. 9 say he
is very ill and frail.
	   Similar filings are being pursued in Switzerland, Sweden and
France.
	   The Spanish magistrate who initiated Pinochet's arrest has
issued a new extradition warrant alleging an unspecified number of
murders, tortures and kidnappings up to 1992, two years after
Pinochet stood down. He remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean
army until March.

Ukraine's government preparing to sell telecommunications monopoly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine plans to sell up to 30 percent of
its telecommunications monopoly, hoping to use the earnings to pay
off the government's mounting debt in overdue wages, the country's
top privatization official said Tuesday.
	   Parliament committees are examining a bill permitting
privatization of the telecommunications company, Ukrtelecom, and
will then submit it to the legislature for debate, State Property
Fund chief Oleksandr Bondar said.
	   Under current law, telecommunications companies in Ukraine are
on a list of businesses barred from privatization.
	   Ukrtelecom and Ukraine's oil and gas pipeline network are widely
considered the former Soviet republic's only properties that could
bring back large foreign investors who massively withdrew from the
country this year, wary of its unstable financial situation.
	   Government officials have repeatedly said they hope to raise
billions of dollars from selling Ukrtelecom to pay off part of
Ukraine's foreign and domestic debts. Bondar said 30 percent of the
company would go up for sale.
	   The government owes more than dlrs 1 billion to state employees
and pensioners, and has been short of cash for years because of
poor tax collection and lack of reforms to boost economic growth.
	   In preparation for Ukrtelecom's privatization, the Cabinet is
reforming the company's structure and the international accounting
firm PricewaterhouseCoopers is planning to audit the company.
	   Ukrtelecom includes 35 subsidiaries and 738 branches throughout
Ukraine and employs 130,000 people.
	   Bondar called any estimates of Ukrtelecom's market value
``premature,'' adding that it could only be determined after
evaluation of the company's equipment and the audit.
	   The investor exodus has left the State Property Fund likely to
channel to the state budget only half the 1 billion hryvna (dlrs
292 million) the government planned to raise from privatization
this year, Bondar said.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new first lady is getting
pointers for her new role from someone with 16 years' experience _
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's wife.
	   Doris Schroeder-Koepf, 35, is a former reporter who lived for a
time in New York. The 65-year-old Hannelore Kohl is known for
charitable work and authoring a cookbook with her husband.
	   The two women ``had a very pleasant conversation for several
hours Monday'' on the eve of Gerhard Schroeder's swearing-in as the
new chancellor, Pro 7 television reported.
	   ``Doris Schroeder-Koepf now faces a lot of public pressure, and
I guess she still has to get used to it,'' Mrs. Kohl said.
	   Schroeder-Koepf said Tuesday she also will support charity _ a
tradition for German chancellors' wives _ but that she was still
deciding on a cause.
	   Schroeder-Koepf watched with a big smile from parliament's
spectator gallery Tuesday as lawmakers formally elected her husband
to succeed Kohl as German leader.
	   Otherwise, she won't be spending much time in Bonn.
Schroeder-Koepf and her 7-year-old daughter intend to stay in the
couple's apartment in Hanover, the capital of Lower Saxony, the
state Schroeder governed from 1990 until becoming chancellor, until
the government moves to Berlin next year.

Numbers-crazy Italians gripped with lotto mania

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italians have jammed the smokeshops, betting parlors
and kiosks that sell lotto tickets, crashing the lottery system's
computers. They've snapped up books peddling everything from math
formulas to dream interpretation for help in picking the
Magnificent Six.
	   And the Super Enalotto jackpot keeps rising.
	   No one has picked the correct six numbers in the twice-weekly
game for 10 straight drawings. That means Wednesday's pot will
likely be at least 50 billion lire (dlrs 30 million), about triple
the game's biggest prize yet and one of Europe's fattest lottery
prizes ever.
	   The 10-month-old Super Enalotto, the latest child in the Italy's
extended family of revenue-raising lotteries and games, has
mesmerized the country.
	   ``Everybody wants to be a millionaire,'' said Enrico Monaco, who
works in a main branch of Feltrinelli bookstore.
	   Hot sellers at his and other shops are how-to books on math
formulas that look something like advanced trig exercises and that
are believed to give players a shot at beating Super Enalotto's
one-in-622,614,630 odds.
	   Then there's the dictionary-like tome ``Smorfia,'' or
``Grimace,'' based on a centuries-old Neapolitan ``science'' for
interpreting dreams as numbers _ numbers buyers hope will yield a
winner.
	   Super Enalotto may seem miserly after July's dlrs 295.7 million
Powerball jackpot in the U.S. state of Indiana, but the Italian
game holds its own when compared with big European wins, like the
dlrs 36 million served up in 1995 by Britain's National Lottery.
	   Italians buying the 1,600-lire (dlrs 1) game cards ahead of
Saturday's drawing for 43 billion lire (dlrs 27 million) played 151
million combinations of numbers, roughly three for every Italian.
Overwhelmed lottery computers broke down in some parts of the
country.
	   Super Enalotto's success has been a relief for the government
following a series of embarrassments that soured Italians on
state-run lotteries. A dlrs 1.3 million national lottery pick was
canceled in early 1997 when a numbers-picking machine malfunctioned
on nationwide TV.
	   Still, there have been rumblings over the fairness of Super
Enalotto and the moral health of its players.
	   Given the very low shot at winning, the jackpot should be
bigger, consumer watchdogs say.
	   A math professor at Rome's Sapienza University, Antonio
Avantaggiati, called Super Enalotto's long odds proof of Italians'
``diabolical'' fantasy. He suggested to La Repubblica newspaper
that the game's possible numbers be limited to far fewer than the
90 (1 through 90) now in play.
	   One reader of Famiglia Cristiana, a top-selling Catholic weekly,
wrote of her worry about all the people saying they would buy a
Ferrari if they won and nobody saying they would give winnings to
charity.

In sign of thaw, Mauritanian foreign minister visits Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in final graf Weizman meeting moved to Wednesday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A visit by the foreign minister of the North
African country of Mauritania was seen by Israel Tuesday as a
possible thaw in relations between the Jewish state and the Arab
world.
	   A senior Israeli foreign ministry official linked the two-day
visit of Sheik El-Afia Wil'd Mohammed Khouna to the new peace
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians negotiated at Wye
Plantation in Maryland last week.
	   ``It's a consequence of the Wye Plantation agreement,'' David
Dadonn told The Associated Press. ``We hope this will be a signal
for more.''
	   After the first peace agreements were signed by Israel and the
Palestinians in 1993 and 1995, several Arab countries established
low-level ties with Israel. However, the contacts were frozen when
the peace talks entered a 17-month stalemate under Israel's
hard-line leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Israel and Mauritania established interest offices, the lowest
level of relations, in November 1995.
	   Israel has similar relations with Qatar and Oman. Tunisia and
Morocco have slightly higher relations, Dadonn said.
	   Egypt is the only North African country that has full diplomatic
relations with Israel.
	   Khouna arrived in Israel Monday and was scheduled to meet with
Israeli President Ezer Weizman Wednesday. Khouna's agenda includes
meetings with Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, and Dan
Tichon, the speaker of Israel's parliament as well as a visit to
Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ After being outfoxed in a national vote for
a powerful clerical assembly, allies of Iran's moderate president
are turning to upcoming city and town elections to try to push
forward his reforms.
	   Supporters of President Mohammad Khatami said Tuesday that since
a hard-line council will not have to approve candidates _ as it did
in last week's balloting _ moderates will stand a better chance in
the elections in Iran's 10,000 municipalities.
	   A victory in these elections, the first such vote since the 1979
Islamic revolution, could serve as an endorsement of Khatami and
create a broad constituency of local officials who support his
efforts to open up the country.
	   ``The vote will be a chance for Mr. Khatami to fulfill his
pledge to the people to draw them into the political arena,'' said
Majid Ansari, a moderate member of Parliament.
	   The election, which on Monday were scheduled for Feb. 26, could
be the next big battle in the running conflict between
conservatives and moderates fought out since Khatami was elected in
May last year.
	   At every step, hard-liners have battled Khatami's efforts to
grant more freedom to the press and the arts and reduce Islamic
strictures on average people _ all reforms that have gained Khatami
widespread public support.
	   In last Friday's elections for the Assembly of Experts, the
moderates were trounced, gaining only 13 seats on the 86-seat
assembly _ compared to 54 for the conservatives.
	   The assembly appoints and oversees the country's supreme leader,
and Khatami's allies had hoped to use it to curb the growing powers
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader who in effect has
the final say in political decisions.
	   The moderates blamed their poor showing on the Council of
Guardians, the body dominated by conservatives which vetted the
candidates and dumped most progressive theologians by paring the
list from 396 to 167.
	   In the municipal elections, candidates will not have to be
clerics or sit for a test on the Shiite Islam dominant in Iran. The
Interior Ministry will be in charge of approving the 200,000 who
will run among the expected 800,000 applicants. The winners will
replace officials left over from the Shah's time or appointees.

Court to release convicted drug baron Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch drug baron convicted of
leading an international drug ring and large-scale tax evasion will
be released Wednesday after less than two years of imprisonment, a
newspaper reported.
	   Etienne Urka, one of the country's most famous drug traffickers,
was convicted and jailed for six years in January by a lower court.
His lawyer appealed the conviction.
	   The Amsterdam Court of Appeal said Tuesday he will be released
because an eventual sentence from the appeal will not exceed the
two years he spent in custody, according to the national daily NRC
Handelsblad.
	   Urka was arrested in Paris in 1996 and he has been in custody
ever since.
	   A court spokesman was not immediately available for comment
Tuesday.

Cyprus Airways shelves plans for non-smoking flights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus Airways was forced to shelve plans
to introduce non-smoking flights after cabin staff threatened not
to comply to protest the exemption of pilots from the ban.
	   The airline has now decided to postpone until early next year
plans to ban smoking on its London and Athens flights for a
two-month trial period, a company official said.
	   Cynika, the union of cabin staff, has maintained that the
exemption given to pilots was unfair.
	   ``Can you imagine how a passenger or a steward who is not
allowed to smoke would feel if the cockpit door opened and all that
smoke gushed out?'' asked Costas Demetriou, the head of the union.
	   Cyprus Airways is 80 per cent owned by the government of Cyprus.
Relations between its management and trade unions are notoriously
tense, and the company returned losses in 1997 and 1996.

Botswana suspends sale of elephants to South African trainer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) _ Botswana suspended the sale of 20
elephants to a South Africa-based animal exporter Tuesday because
of questions on treatment of previously shipped elephants that
raised an international outcry.
	   Meanwhile, a court custody battle of 30 baby elephants that were
shipped earlier from Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve to the
wild animal trainer continued. Two experts bolstered the trainer's
contention the animals hadn't been abused.
	   Veterinarian Claire Speedy told the court in Brits, South
Africa, the elephants were not being beaten into submission as had
been alleged and had received sufficient food and water.
	   Professor Henk Bertschinger, who tested blood samples from six
of the elephants, said the results showed the animals were
receiving sufficient water and were not stressed.
	   Some animal protection groups claim the elephants _ which are
destined for zoos in Switzerland and Germany and a safari park in
China _ had been abused.
	   Britain's Spice Girls pop group and rocker Chrissie Hynde have
appealed to South African President Nelson Mandela to prevail on
his Botswana counterpart, Festus Mogae, to help the elephants
return to their families.
	   Botswana said Tuesday it could not accept the return of the
elephants, the South African Press Association reported.
	   But the Botswanan government said it was suspending the sale of
20 more elephants to the trainer, Riccardo Ghiazza of African Games
Services, because of concern about the welfare of the 30 previously
shipped elephants, SAPA reported.
	   Botswanan wildlife experts checked the elephants already in
South Africa and found their ``current condition and management ...
acceptable but not ideal,'' the government said in a statement.
	   South Africa's National Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals laid criminal charges Ghiazza for allegedly abusing the
animals.
	   African Game Services obtained a last-minute court interdict
preventing the NSPCA from removing the animals from Ghiazza's land
near Brits.

Tanzanian student dies of malaria in Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A Tanzanian student has died of
malaria in a Romanian hospital, a Health Ministry official said
Tuesday.
	   Atif Tijani, 28, who was studying medicine in Constanta, died
Monday in a hospital at the Black Sea port, 225 kilometers (141
miles) east of Bucharest.
	   Dr. Daniela Pitigoi, a senior official at the ministry, said
that Tijani had fallen ill earlier this month after he returned to
Romania to start his fifth year of studies.
	   ``He neglected the illness at first, thinking it was a cold,''
said Pitigoi by telephone. She said every year some 20 cases of
malaria are reported, all of them contracted outside Romania.

he quit over financial shortages, considering other post,
background. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia's security minister has quit, a
week after mutinous soldiers staged a one-day revolt against
President Eduard Shevardnadze.
	   Shevardnadze accepted the resignation of Security Minister
Dzhemal Gakhokidze on Monday, the Georgian presidential press
service said Tuesday.
	   Gakhokidze said he resigned because financial shortages made it
impossible to carry out key reforms in the country's security
system, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Under Gakhokidze's leadership, the security ministry failed to
head off a number of violent incidents, including a rocket attack
on Shevardnadze, the hostage-taking of four U.N. observers, and the
recent revolt.
	   Thirty-one people have been arrested in connection with the Oct.
19 revolt in western Georgia, although the leader, Akakiy Eliava,
remains at large.
	   Eliava is a military commander who supported the late Georgian
president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when
it gained independence in 1991, was ousted in early 1992 and fought
a short war in a bid to return to power. He died under mysterious
circumstances in 1994.
	   Gakhokidze will likely take the post of deputy secretary of the
Georgian National Security Council, a job he was offered Monday
after he resigned, Interfax reported.

<TEXT>
	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch roared through the
northwestern Caribbean with heart-stopping strength Tuesday,
churning up high waves and intense rain that sent coastal residents
of Honduras fleeing for safer ground.
	   President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum
alert and the Honduran military sent planes to evacuate residents
from their homes on islands near the coast. Floods struck poor
coastal neighborhoods.
	   At 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT), Mitch was 90 miles (145 kilometers)
north of Honduras and moving west, parallel to the coast, at 6 mph
(10 kph). With winds near 165 mph (265 kph), and even more violent
gusts, the 350-mile-wide (565-kilometer-wide) hurricane was a
Category 5 monster _ the highest, most dangerous rating for a
storm.
	   ``Mitch is closing in,'' said Monterrey Cardenas, mayor of
Utila, an island 20 miles (30 kilometers) off the Honduran coast.
``And God help us.''
	   The U.S. National Weather Service said only three Caribbean
storms were stronger than Mitch _ Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980
and an unnamed 1935 storm.
	   Forecasters expected Mitch to swirl parallel to the Honduran
coast and then turn northward over the next two days and head for
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and its resorts of Cancun and Cozumel.
	   Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States,
forecasters said.
	   The weather service in Miami said the storm could weaken
somewhat. ``It is very unusual for hurricanes to reach and maintain
such great intensity for very long, but hurricanes such as these
are rare events themselves,'' it said in a statement Tuesday.
	   In La Ceiba, on the western Honduran coast, people waded
knee-deep to their houses after rains from Mitch's outer swells
sent rivers rising.
	   Many people took refuge in fire stations and schools. At one
shelter in a fire station, about 150 people _ mostly children _
huddled in the damp, with nothing dry to cover themselves.
	   Blanca Almeida Ramirez, 22, said she and her three children fled
in the middle of the night when water began to seep into her wooden
house. ``The wood is all rotten inside,'' she said. ``I couldn't
stay any longer.''
	   Others tried to stick it out.
	   ``I'm not going anywhere,'' said Teresa Nunez, 38, who lives in
a simple wooden home by the beach with her 11 children. She said
she was afraid thieves would steal what little she owned if she
left.
	   In the nearby village of Jutiapa, two brothers were electrocuted
Monday when they tried to remove a TV antenna from their roof in
preparation for the storm.
	   The entire coast of Honduras was under a hurricane warning, and
up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain was forecast in
mountainous areas.
	   The Honduran president closed schools and public offices on the
coast Monday and ordered air force aircraft to evacuate people from
the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's
central coast.
	   The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco,
said 5,000 soldiers were standing by to help victims of the storm,
but he warned that the military could not reach everyone.
	   Five northeastern villages were cut off by flooding, but police
evacuated all 2,000 residents before rivers rose there, according
to the national police chief, Col. Anael Perez. Two other villages
were cut off by fallen trees.
	   In El Progreso, 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the capital
of Tegucigalpa, the army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live
in low-lying banana plantations along the Ulua River, said Nolly
Soliman, a resident.
	   The strongest hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory was
Fifi in 1974, which killed at least 2,000 people.
	   A hurricane warning was also in effect for the coasts of
neighboring Guatemala and Belize.
	   In Belize, schools were closed and workers sent home. Panicking
buyers stripped bread from the shelves of some stores, and some
gasoline stations ran dry.
	   Coastal Belize City was hit so hard by Hurricane Hattie in 1961
that the country built a new capital inland at Belmopan.
	   Elsewhere, Mexico mobilized troops and emergency workers on the
eastern coast of the Yucatan, which was also under a hurricane
watch, and Cuba said it had evacuated 600 vacationers from the
Island of Youth.
	   Schools stayed closed Tuesday in the Cayman Islands, where waves
up to 10 feet (3 meters) high pounded the shoreline and damaged
beachfront condominiums on the western coast of Grand Cayman.

Four Tibetan monks using fake passports arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Four Tibetan monks posing as Nepali
citizens were arrested by immigration officials Tuesday as they
tried to leave India, domestic news agencies reported.
	   Tibetan exiles living in India are not given visas to travel
abroad. The monks were traveling on forged passports obtained for
rupees 40,000 or dlrs 1,000, the United New of India said.
	   The monks, who are residents of Dharamsala town in northern
India, were trying to board a flight for Bangkok at New Delhi's
Indira Gandhi International Airport.
	   The passports were finely forged and the first two pages of the
document were washed out to erase the original names, UNI said. The
names of the monks were then filled out and fresh photographs were
substituted.
	   Thousands of Tibetans fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising
against Chinese occupation. Many, including the Tibetan spiritual
leader the Dalai Lama, now live in Dharamsala and other parts of
India.

In sign of thaw, Mauritanian foreign minister visits Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in final graf Weizman meeting moved to Wednesday

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A visit by the foreign minister of the North
African country of Mauritania was seen by Israel Tuesday as a
possible thaw in relations between the Jewish state and the Arab
world.
	   A senior Israeli foreign ministry official linked the two-day
visit of Sheik El-Afia Wil'd Mohammed Khouna to the new peace
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians negotiated at Wye
Plantation in Maryland last week.
	   ``It's a consequence of the Wye Plantation agreement,'' David
Dadonn told The Associated Press. ``We hope this will be a signal
for more.''
	   After the first peace agreements were signed by Israel and the
Palestinians in 1993 and 1995, several Arab countries established
low-level ties with Israel. However, the contacts were frozen when
the peace talks entered a 17-month stalemate under Israel's
hard-line leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Israel and Mauritania established interest offices, the lowest
level of relations, in November 1995.
	   Israel has similar relations with Qatar and Oman. Tunisia and
Morocco have slightly higher relations, Dadonn said.
	   Egypt is the only North African country that has full diplomatic
relations with Israel.
	   Khouna arrived in Israel Monday and was scheduled to meet with
Israeli President Ezer Weizman Wednesday. Khouna's agenda includes
meetings with Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, and Dan
Tichon, the speaker of Israel's parliament as well as a visit to
Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial.

 &UR; Doctors Without Borders gives accounts of gruesome Serb torture

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The civilian population of Kosovo has been
subjected to a ``systematic policy of terror'' that includes
massacres, decapitations and cutting off ears, according to a
report by the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders published
Tuesday.
	   In a faxed statement summarizing the report, Doctors Without
Borders said that civilians, villages and goods like tractors
necessary for survival ``appear to be the deliberate targets of
(Serb) military operations.''
	   In an article giving further details of the report, the daily Le
Monde described accounts of such terror obtained by volunteers of
the Paris-based aid group between Sept. 23 and Oct. 5 in the area
covering the Pec, Prizren and Drenica valley regions.
	   Efforts to help victims were hindered by the destruction of the
medical infrastructure and persecution of local doctors, Doctors
Without Borders said.
	   Le Monde provided a detailed account by volunteers of Doctors
Without Borders of the gruesome acts of terror allegedly carried
out by Serb soldiers and police, who in several cases bartered
civilians' lives for gold jewelry or cash payments.
	   One account, dated Oct. 5 from the Klodernica region, quotes a
mother of one family saying Serb militias, arriving in the ``Valley
of Apples,'' doused children's clothes with gasoline to frighten
them and took women's jewelry.
	   A family from the Vucac Valley recounts militia demanding money
to save the men's lives. ``In front of our eyes, they cut the ears
off a man they found in the mountains and put them in our hands,''
said an aunt, not identified by name. Three men were then killed in
a ditch before their eyes, she added.
	   The father of the same family, named Osman, is quoted as saying
that in the village of Obrije, ``I buried 13 people in a day.''
	   ``One had no head. His brain was smashed,'' Osman was quoted as
saying. ``On that day, we saw some horrible things.
	   ``I saw an 80-year-old woman, her ears cut. A 17-member family,
all killed ....''
	   ``In each offensive, first the military came with tanks, then
the police. You'd think they were programmed to kill.''
	   In Obrije, the man said, the militia took over a household,
killing three men and cutting off their ears. They asked a woman to
watch over the children while they ``played all night with the
bodies. An 18-year-old girl who tried to escape was killed and
``her eyes torn out,'' Osman was quoted as saying.
	   The account did not explain how Osman was made aware of the
scene.

Five suspects arrested for allegedly smuggling Chinese to Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARNHEM, Netherlands (AP) _ Police have arrested five people
suspected of running a network that has smuggled as many as 350
Chinese immigrants to Europe, Dutch media reported Tuesday.
	   Police in this eastern Dutch city arrested four Chinese
nationals and a Vietnamese and were questioning another 50 Chinese
believed to be illegal immigrants.
	   The network is believed to have smuggled people mostly to the
Netherlands, Germany and England from China.
	   People paid up to 60,000 guilders (dlrs 30,000) for the trip,
according to the Dutch national news agency ANP.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Showing resolve to keep their side of the new
peace agreement with Israel, Palestinian security forces on Tuesday
arrested two Palestinian suspects in the grisly killing of a Jewish
settler in the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   A roadside stone memorial set up settlers Tuesday in the spot
where 29-year-old Danny Vargas was dumped from his car by his
killers a day before bore the inscription ``avenge the blood.''
	   In a second funeral Tuesday, some 3,000 Palestinians buried a
65-year-old elderly Palestinian, Mohammed Zalout, who was
bludgeoned to death a day before near a Jewish settlement of Itamar
in the northern West Bank, apparently by an Israeli extremist.
	   The crowd chanted ``revenge, revenge,'' and the Israeli army
declared Palestinian towns in the West Bank off-limits to Israelis,
apparently because of concern about possible attacks.
	   Despite the latest violence, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said he was determined to withdraw troops from 13 percent of the
West Bank over the next 12 weeks, as promised.
	   ``The only thing that can prevent the implementation of the
agreement is if the (Israeli) Cabinet does not approve it, or if
the Palestinians do not fulfill it,'' Netanyahu said.
	   However, Netanyahu was evasive when asked whether he would
freeze a withdrawal if parliament passes an early elections bill
that was approved Monday for a first reading by parliament.
	   Israeli media speculated Tuesday that Netanyahu might try to
discourage the dovish opposition from backing the bill by declaring
that in the event of early elections he would suspend the pullback.
	   Netanyahu said he would not relate to the possibility of spring
elections because he hoped ``it will not happen.''
	   The most vocal critics of Netanyahu have been Jewish settlers
and their representatives in parliament. At Vargas' open grave,
politicians and friends delivering eulogies demanded that Netanyahu
go back on his promise to withdraw from West Bank land.
	   ``You promised us peace and security, and we have neither,''
said legislator Rehavam Zeevi from the far-right opposition party
Moledet, referring to Netanyahu. His speech was punctuated by
shouts of ``wage war'' by some of the mourners.
	   Monday's two killings tested the new peace agreement's
centerpiece: a pledge by the Palestinians to work harder to rein in
militants.
	   Demonstrating a new attitude, Palestinian security forces who
had suspended cooperation with Israel for most of the past 17
months on Tuesday arrested two Hebron men in the Vargas killing.
	   Ahmed Tibi, a spokesman for Arafat, said one of the men was
suspected of having shot Vargas and the other of having been an
accomplice.
	   The two suspects also confessed to killing a Jewish seminary
student earlier this month near the communal farm of Ora south of
Jerusalem, Tibi said.
	   Israel army radio identified the main suspect as Jamal Jadallah
and said he denied he had any ties to the Islamic militant group
Hamas, the main opponent to peace with Israel.
	   Despite the new cooperation, Israeli troops reacted harshly to
the Vargas killing, clamping a curfew on the downtown area of
Hebron they control and sealing the city so Palestinians could not
leave or enter.
	   The curfew barred some 30,000 Palestinians from leaving their
homes. During the crackdown, troops entered a girls' elementary
school and ordered the students, some of them crying, to go home.
	   Since August, downtown Hebron residents have already been under
curfew twice for a total of three weeks, and the new restrictions
embittered many Palestinians.
	   ``We thought that we could now go to Gaza, but we cannot even
leave our homes,'' said Khalil Jaberi, 26, referring to a provision
in the accord for a new land route for Palestinians between the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.

EU voices support of Russian reforms, makes no new commitments

and other meetings. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
received promises of European Union support Tuesday for his
government's reform efforts but no new financial commitments to
bolster the country's devastated economy.
	   Instead, Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said he hoped the
second tranche of a dlrs 22.2 billion International Monetary Fund
loan package can be transmitted as soon as Russia submits an
economic reform program.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
	   Primakov, substituting for ailing President Boris Yeltsin,
arrived here on a one-day visit to brief EU officials on economic
recovery plans and seek help in coping with Moscow's worst economic
crisis of the post-Soviet era.
	   But Klima and the president of the European Commission, Jacques
Santer, told him only that the EU would seek to intensify
cooperation with Russia.
	   ``The European Union underscores the need for the sustained
economic program, the improvement of the social situation'' in
Russia, Klima told reporters at a brief news conference after the
talks.
	   ``We deem it significant that the ... development of our mutual
relations on the basis of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement
is deepened by a fast implementation of commitments made'' by the
Russians, Klima declared.
	   Since the crisis in Russia intensified, the Europeans have made
clear they want to see evidence that Moscow will not veer from its
economic reform program before they will commit major funding to
help restore the Russian economy.
	   Primakov recalled that in the talks, the EU leaders had
``expressed satisfaction'' with the Russian government program
approved last Saturday.
	   ``This shows that we are doing all we can to put together an
economic market with a social component attached to it,'' Primakov
said. ``You can only carry out monetarism with the population on
your side,'' referring to a tight money policy.
	   Western governments and financial institutions have expressed
concern that the Russians might print large amounts of rubles to
cover expenses, thereby devaluing their currency.
	   ``We are very keen on having close links with the EU and we will
do what we can to achieve that,'' Primakov said, adding his talks
with the EU would be a ``leitmotiv'' for Russia to carry on. He
vaguely spoke of the ``real possibility by the EU Investment Bank
in Russia.''
	   ``We will do what we can to make sure that we can stabilize the
economic and social situation in the country,'' said Primakov.
	   During the visit, Austrian state secretary Benita
Ferrero-Waldner and Vladimir Bulgak, the Russian deputy prime
minister, agreed to hold a meeting of the EU-Russia cooperation
council in Moscow in early December. A Foreign Ministry statement
said the committee is to focus on trade and economic issues.
	   In addition, several sub-committees are to meet in the next few
weeks dealing with organized crime, the effects of the Russian
financial crisis on EU exports as well as nuclear safety.
	   Earlier in the day, during his courtesy call on Austrian
President Thomas Klestil, Primakov praised Austria's role as a
neutral, non-NATO country, saying the ``neutral status of Austria
has helped not hurt'' it.
	   Primakov was accompanied by Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and
several other ministers in charge of economic and financial
policies.
	   Primakov, the former foreign minister, has been prime minister
for only six weeks and has yet to produce his own blueprint to deal
with the country's deep-rooted economic problems.
	   He is, however, widely respected by all political factions and
is seen as a stabilizing influence at a time when Yeltsin has
receded into the background.
	   Before leaving Moscow, Primakov held talks with Yeltsin at the
president's country residence outside of Moscow, Yeltsin's press
service said.
	   Yeltsin authorized him to tell EU officials about the
government's plan to cope with the latest economic crisis,
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Russia's economic crisis, coupled with major downturns in East
Asia and Latin America, has sent shock waves through Europe at a
time when EU governments have taken a major turn to the left.
	   During their summit last weekend in Poertschach, Austria, the
EU's 15 leaders pledged to coordinate economic policies to cope
with financial crises in Russia and elsewhere.

Becker delights the home crowd once again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Boris Becker began what could possibly
be his last tournament at home with a 6-2, 7-5 victory over Sjeng
Schalken at the dlrs 2.45 million Eurocard Open on Tuesday.
	   Becker, 30, is in semi-retirement and this is only his 10th
tournament of the year. The three-time Wimbledon champion suffered
an ankle injury and had not played between July and the Basel
tournament three weeks ago, where he lost in the first round.
	   ``I was very glad to be back on the tennis court,'' Becker said.
``I've played one tennis match in three months and I was able to
put it away in two sets, I was very pleased with that.''
	   Becker's last victory on the tour was also in Stuttgart, when he
beat Felix Mantilla in the third round of the outdoor clay-court
event, before losing to Marcelo Rios.
	   The presence of Becker still guarantees a big crowd in Germany
and more than 6,000 fans joined in a loud celebration after he used
his seventh match point to dispatch Schalken, a Dutch qualifier.
Becker was born in Leimen, not far from Stuttgart.
	   ``It gives me great satisfaction to be able to do what I really
love,'' Becker said. ``I hope I can do it a few more times. I am
very glad to be able to still come back and play decent tennis.''
	   Becker, who is also Germany's Davis Cup team chief, now plays
only selected tournaments and his plans for next year are unclear,
although the veteran sounded like he might continue playing some
events.
	   If the ankle injury had not healed quickly, Becker said, ``I
don't think I was going to be back next year.''
	   ``I wanted to play more indoors but it was very difficult to
come back and actually play again because the muscles didn't work,
the ankle hurt,'' he said. Another major injury would probably mean
the end of his career, said Becker, who plans to play in Paris and
Stockholm in the next two weeks.
	   Becker, who has won the Stuttgart tournament twice, will play
French Open champion Carlos Moya in the second round. He is also
playing doubles here with Andre Agassi.
	   Becker's Davis Cup team also had a winning day.
	   Tommy Haas beat David Nainkin of South Africa, a ``lucky loser''
from the qualifying round, 6-4, 6-4, and Nicolas Kiefer defeated
Byron Black 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-0).
	   Kiefer, who rallied from a 5-1 deficit in the third set and
saved five match points, will play top-ranked Pete Sampras in the
seocnd round.
	   Two seeded players lost in the second round.
	   Todd Martin upset eight-ranked Karol Kucera 6-2, 6-4, a defeat
that could spoil Kucera's hopes of qualifying for the eight-man
World Championship next month in Hanover, Germany.
	   Albert Costa, the 16th-ranked Spaniard who has never won an
indoor match in his career, stayed true to form by losing 6-2, 6-2
to Bohdan Ulihrach.

Welsh Secretary resigns over `lapse of judgment' with a stranger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Welsh Secretary in Britain's 22-member Cabinet
resigned Tuesday, saying he was guilty of a ``lapse of judgment''
after picking up a stranger who robbed him at knifepoint in south
London.
	   Ron Davies, who almost certainly would have become the First
Minister _ the equivalent of Welsh prime minister _ when the
principality gets its first separate assembly next May, said he had
fallen below standards set by Prime Minister Tony Blair and wanted
to minimize embarrassment.
	   He gave no detailed explanation of why he felt so culpable.
	   A spokesman for Blair, who accepted the resignation, said Davies
had denied the incident on Monday night was related to a sexual
encounter.
	   ``I wanted to make sure this government carries on with the very
high standards it has set itself,'' Davies, 52, said in a
television interview. ``I felt I had fallen below those
standards.''
	   Blair recently extolled family values. His 18-month-old
government, however, has a reputation for being relatively liberal
on social ethics and lifestyle. On coming to power, for example,
Blair appointed Britain's first openly gay Cabinet minister,
Culture Secretary Chris Smith.
	   Davies said in his resignation letter that he went for a walk
Monday night on Clapham Common after returning to London from
Wales. He was approached by a male stranger, started chatting and
accepted an invitation to pick up two of the strangers' friends and
go to the man's apartment for a meal, he said.
	   Davies said he collected the male and female friend in his car
and that the two men soon robbed him of his wallet and private
mobile phone and ``stole my car, leaving me standing by the
roadside.''
	   ``In allowing myself to be placed in this situation, with people
I had never met and about whom I knew nothing, I did something very
foolish. That is a serious lapse of judgment on my part,'' Davies
wrote.
	   He said the incident, which he reported to the police, would
embarrass the government and his family. He is married and has one
daughter.
	   Blair replied that he accepted Davies' resignation ``with a real
sense of sadness.''
	   Government officials said there were no Cabinet papers in the
stolen car.
	   Davies, a former schoolteacher, is a longtime career politician
in the Labor Party, which dominates politics in Wales. He led last
year's referendum campaign on whether to have a separate assembly
for Wales. It was only narrowly accepted.
	   Earlier this year, he won the Labor nomination for the First
Minister in the assembly, which is virtually certain to be
dominated by Laborites.

Scandal-hit church in Cyprus faces new embarrassment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The head of the Greek Orthodox Church in
Cyprus called in clergymen from across the Mediterranean island to
identify two robed men photographed leaving a brothel.
	   A local television station showed the picture last week, and
Archbishop Chrysostomos asked dozens of clergymen to come to
Nicosia on Monday, the English-language daily Cyprus Mail said.
	   One of the men in the picture was identified as a priest who
once served in the southern port city of Limassol.
	   The other man was identified as a priest currently serving in
Limassol. He later denied any wrongdoing. The church did not say
whether it planned to pursue the inquiry further.
	   The church recently has been rocked by allegations of fraud
against one of its bishops. Its Holy Synod this month set up a
committee of three bishops to investigate the allegations, the
subject of a separate probe by the police.

International agencies provide dlrs 110,000 to save Amur tigers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ International aid agencies have raised dlrs
110,000 to protect the endangered Amur tigers in the Russian Far
East from forest fires that have been raging in the region for
months, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The money was raised by World Wide Fund for Nature, the U.S.
Agency for International Development and the Swiss fund Emergency
Aid to Tigers, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing Igor
Chistin, the WWF's chief representative in Russia.
	   Only 500 of the tigers are believed to exist, and U.N. experts
who visited Russia's Far East earlier this month said the animals
are threatened by the forest fires.
	   Economic damage from the fires is estimated at 400 million
rubles (dlrs 25.5 million), the U.N. experts said. Some 79.2
million rubles (dlrs 5 million) have been spent on fire-fighting.
	   Firefighters have been unable to control the blazes because of
severe funding shortages and an unusually dry summer. The fires may
burn until snow or rain extinguishes them, officials have said.

U.N. overhauls Iraq's crop-spraying helicopters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations, which monitors Iraqi
crop-dusting helicopters for fear that they could be used to spray
chemical weapons, has overhauled seven of Baghdad's choppers.
	   The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said in a report
released this week that helicopter spare parts worth dlrs 3.5
million reached Iraq this summer and they were immediately used to
repair the helicopters.
	   The FAO stored the parts in a special warehouse and kept them
under constant surveillance.
	   Iraqi aircraft are barred from northern and southern no-fly
zones over the country and the U.N. organization has hired
Hungarian pilots to fly the helicopters within those areas.
	   The money for the overhaul, the report added, came from revenues
from Iraq's oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.
	   Iraq was permitted to sell dlrs 5.2 billion of oil for six
months ending in late November in the latest phase of the deal.
	   The oil sales are an exemption from the trade sanctions the
United Nations imposed against Iraq after Baghdad's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions are not to be lifted until Iraq fully cooperates
with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The FAO report contradicts Iraqi claims that the organization is
hoarding the spare parts and not giving them to Iraq.

Government program completed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The four political parties of the
next Slovak govenment agreed Tuesday on the basic principles of its
future program after all-day discussions.
	   ``There are no contradictions in the government program,'' said
Bela Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian Coalition party, speaking on
behalf of the four parties. No details of the program were
released.
	   The four opposition parties gained a constitutional majority of
93 seats in the September parliamentary elections.
	   Discussions on the division of seats in the future government,
which will lead to the signing of a coalition agreement, began
Monday and were to continue until an agreement had been signed.
	   ``We will try to sign the coalition agreement as we have been
stating it so far,'' Bugar told reporters at a news conference held
during a break in the talks Tuesday.
	   Before returning to negotiations, the four parties were meeting
individually to discuss their political postitions.
	   Late Monday, the four decided on a new distribution of power in
the future government, adding two posts _ a vice premier and a
minister without a portfolio _ one for each of the smaller parties.
	   Under the latest government plan, the leading Slovak Democratic
Coalition party, would hold nine posts. The party of the Deomcratic
Left would have six posts, with the two smaller parties holding
three each.
	   The previous division was the same, with only two seats for each
of the small parties.
	   The new Slovak parliament is to have its first session on
Thursday when the present government of Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar is expected to resign.

Israel cites U.S. support in warning Palestinians on security
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Tuesday maintained that it had U.S.
backing for its warning that there would be no West Bank troop
withdrawal unless Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority made good
on its security pledges.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is enmeshed in a fight for his
political survival with hard-liners vowing to bolt his coalition
and force early elections which could freeze implementation of the
Wye River accord.
	   Israeli officials are particularly concerned about continuing
attacks by Palestinian militants and complain they have not yet
received a Palestinian action plan for fighting terrorism. Unless
it is received by Friday, the withdrawal timetable could be
delayed, one official said on condition of anonymity.
	   In support of its position, Netanyahu's office released a letter
to the Israeli leader from U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in which she affirmed that each stage of the Wye River
accord would have to be completed before moving on.
	   ``We believe its parallel phased approach will help provide
greater confidence to both sides in the implementation process,
since actions in each stage of the time line are to be completed by
both sides before moving to the next stage,'' the letter said.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, pointed to the letter
as evidence that ``unless there is a fulfillment of Palestinian
obligations and compliance there will be no withdrawal.''
	   Albright, in a letter dated Oct. 23, assured Netanyahu there
were ``procedures in place,'' to prevent what Israel terms a
revolving door policy of arresting Palestinian terror suspects and
then releasing them without punishment.
	   ``Furthermore, we will express our opposition to any unwarranted
releases of such suspects, and in the event of such a release, we
will be prepared to express our position publicly,'' the letter
said.
	   She pledged that the United States would brief Israel
periodically on efforts to confiscate illegal arms.
	   Albright restated ``our ironclad commitment to Israel's security
and to peace, and to stress that Palestinian security undertakings
are a critical foundation of the (Wye River) Memorandum.''
	   Bar-Illan described the political situation Netanyahu is in as
``very touch-and-go.''
	   ``The only thing that will settle it is compliance by the
Palestinians and adherence by the U.S. administration to all its
promises regarding compliance by the Palestinians. That will enable
the coalition to be stabilized,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Netanyahu told reporters that implementing the agreement would
only be affected by Palestinian compliance or a negative vote in
his 18-member Cabinet, which is deeply uneasy about the Wye accord
but is expected to approve it.
	   ``The only thing that can prevent the implementation of the
agreement is if the (Israeli) Cabinet does not approve it, or if
the Palestinians do not fulfill it,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Referring to the slaying of a Jewish settler in the West Bank
town of Hebron Monday, Netanyahu said he expected the Palestinian
leadership to condemn the bloodshed, which it has not yet done.
	   ``We expect a denunciation, and we also expect action, full
co-operation in the field of security,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Later, Palestinian police arrested two suspects in the killing
of the settler, Danny Vargas. The Palestinians also allowed Israeli
investigators to cross into their sector of Hebron to investigate
the killing.

EU voices support of Russian reforms, makes no new commitments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new grafs 14-15 on EU-Russia cooperation council
and other meetings. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
received promises of European Union support Tuesday for economic
reforms but no new financial commitments to bolster the country's
devastated finances.
	   Instead, Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said he hoped the
second tranche of a dlrs 22.2 billion International Monetary Fund
loan package can be transmitted as soon as Russia submits an
economic reform program.
	   Primakov, substituting for ailing President Boris Yeltsin,
arrived in Austria, which currently holds the rotating EU
presidency, on a one-day visit to brief EU officials on economic
recovery plans. He also sought help in coping with Moscow's worst
economic crisis of the post-Soviet era.
	   But Klima and the president of the European Commission, Jacques
Santer, told him only that the EU would seek to intensify
cooperation with Russia.
	   ``The European Union underscores the need for the sustained
economic program, the improvement of the social situation'' in
Russia, Klima told reporters at a brief news conference after the
talks.
	   Since the crisis in Russia intensified, the Europeans have made
clear they want to see evidence that Moscow will not veer from its
economic reform program before they will commit major funding to
help restore the Russian economy.
	   Primakov recalled that in the talks, the EU leaders had
``expressed satisfaction'' with the Russian government program
approved last Saturday.
	   ``This shows that we are doing all we can to put together an
economic market with a social component attached to it,'' Primakov
said. ``You can only carry out monetarism with the population on
your side,'' referring to a tight money policy.
	   Western governments and financial institutions have expressed
concern that the Russians might print large amounts of rubles to
cover expenses, thereby devaluing their currency.
	   ``We are very keen on having close links with the EU and we will
do what we can to achieve that,'' Primakov said, adding his talks
with the EU would be a ``leitmotiv'' for Russia to carry on. He
vaguely spoke of the ``real possibility by the EU Investment Bank
in Russia.''
	   ``We will do what we can to make sure that we can stabilize the
economic and social situation in the country,'' said Primakov.
	   During the visit, Austrian state secretary Benita
Ferrero-Waldner and Vladimir Bulgak, the Russian deputy prime
minister, agreed to hold a December meeting of the EU-Russia
cooperation council in Moscow. A Foreign Ministry statement said
the committee is to focus on trade and economic issues.
	   In addition, several subcommittees are to meet in the coming
weeks on organized crime, the effects of the Russian financial
crisis on EU exports and nuclear safety.
	   Primakov, the former foreign minister, has been prime minister
for only six weeks and has yet to produce his own blueprint to deal
with the country's deep-rooted economic problems. He is, however,
widely respected by all political factions and is seen as a
stabilizing influence at a time when Yeltsin has receded into the
background.
	   Before leaving Moscow, Primakov held talks with Yeltsin at the
president's country residence outside of Moscow, Yeltsin's press
service said.
	   Yeltsin authorized him to tell EU officials about the
government's plan to cope with the latest economic crisis,
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Russia's economic crisis, coupled with major downturns in East
Asia and Latin America, has sent shock waves through Europe at a
time when EU governments have taken a major turn to the left.
	   During their summit last weekend in Poertschach, Austria, the
EU's 15 leaders pledged to coordinate economic policies to cope
with financial crises in Russia and elsewhere.

Yeltsin checks into sanitarium for open-ended stay

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An infirm Boris Yeltsin sought sanctuary Tuesday
at a rest home outside Moscow, retreating further from the
political spotlight and leaving the country guessing about the
exact nature of his illness.
	   The Russian leader, who has been an infrequent visitor to the
Kremlin in recent months, checked into the Barvikha sanitarium for
an open-ended stay to recover from what's been described as high
blood pressure and exhaustion.
	   Yeltsin has played only a marginal role in dealing with the
country's painful economic crisis, and some analysts say the
country is being guided mostly by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
who has been in office less than two months.
	   ``Ever since he was appointed, Primakov has been acting more as
a president than as a chairman of the government,'' said Nikolai
Petrov, a political analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for Peace
in Moscow.
	   Primakov traveled to Vienna, Austria, on Tuesday to fill in for
Yeltsin at a summit between Russia and the European Union. Yeltsin
called off the trip Monday due to his illness, the latest in a
string of maladies that have dogged him for years.
	   Primakov and Yeltsin met early Tuesday at the president's
Gorky-9 country residence outside Moscow before the prime minister
left for Vienna and Yeltsin moved to the sanitarium.
	   Russian television broadcast pictures of Yeltsin sitting in a
chair behind a small table and talking to Primakov. Yeltsin,
wearing a blue sweater, was not visibly ill. He nodded in response
to Primakov's comments, but their words were not broadcast.
	   Dr. Michael DeBakey, an American cardiologist who consulted with
Yeltsin's doctors before and after his 1996 heart surgery,
predicted Tuesday it would take Yeltsin more than a week to bounce
back. But ``he'll recover from all this and he'll be back at
work,'' DeBakey told The Associated Press in Houston.
	   He said the Kremlin medical team has not approached him about
Yeltsin's latest illness. ``Based on the information I've been able
to put together, he had a very bad cold, kind of flu-like
bronchitis that sort of knocked him out.''
	   The president and his doctors say Yeltsin has no crippling
illness and will serve out his term, which lasts until the middle
of the year 2000.
	   Still, few people in Russia believe that Yeltsin, 67, will ever
again be the robust, reform-minded leader that he was during his
early years in power.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Tuesday that Yeltsin's
aides were ``mocking'' Russians by insisting the president had no
serious health problems.
	   ``Mr. Yeltsin's inability to work has been obvious to us for
quite a long time,'' Zyuganov told a news conference. He called for
Yeltsin to undergo an independent medical exam and for the results
to be made public.
	   Yeltsin has rarely put in full days at the Kremlin since the
spring, spending most of his time at country residences west of the
city.
	   The Barvikha sanitarium, where Yeltsin recuperated from heart
bypass surgery in 1996, has extensive medical facilities, but is
not considered a hospital.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Yeltsin would
undergo ``a course of restoration treatment,'' the Interfax news
agency reported. The length of his stay depends on the treatment
scheduled, he said, without elaborating.
	   Yeltsin's office said Monday the Russian leader was suffering
from an ``asthenic condition.'' Asthenia refers to a lack of
physical strength.
	   The Kremlin has often provided only partial information about
Yeltsin's ailments in the past, contributing to a general mood of
skepticism and speculation that his condition is worse than
announced.
	   If Yeltsin were to resign, Primakov would succeed him on an
interim basis, and new elections would be called within three
months.
	   Yakushkin, the presidential spokesman, said canceling the trip
to Austria was a difficult decision for Yeltsin, but he feared his
opponents would exploit any public signs of weakness.
	   ``He understands that this visit would be like a litmus test
watched by many politicians and, primarily, his foes,'' Yakushkin
said. ``He understands quite well that everyone would mostly watch
how he walks and talks, not the essence of the talks.''
	   Yeltsin postponed a meeting with Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman scheduled for next week in Moscow, Tudjman's spokesman said
Tuesday. Yeltsin has also put off a trip to Malaysia next month,
though his aides insist his schedule for other foreign trips
remains unchanged.

Peace talks in Guinea-Bissau postponed over venue dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Efforts to end the conflict in
Guinea-Bissau suffered a setback Tuesday when the West African
nation's warring factions called off the meeting due to a dispute
over the venue, news reports said.
	   The country's President and the former army chief seeking to
oust him were due to meet Tuesday for their first face-to-face
talks since the military rebellion erupted June 7 in the former
Portuguese colony.
	   But President Joao Bernardo Vieira and Brig. Ansumane Mane
called the meeting off because they were unable to agree on a
venue, Portuguese state radio Antena 1 reported.
	   They later rescheduled their planned meeting for Wednesday in
Gambia, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of Guinea-Bissau,
the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported, citing government
sources.
	   The insurgents could not confirm that the Gambia talks would
take place, Lusa said.
	   The ambassadors of Portugal, France and Sweden were behind the
latest effort to bring the foes together.
	   Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama told reporters in Lisbon
that Vieira and Mane would abide by a cease-fire until the talks
were held.
	   A truce had been in place since July 26 but fighting restarted
10 days ago, deepening the plight of some 500,000 displaced people
in the country of 1 million.
	   The breakaway military faction controls most of the country.
Government forces, constituted mainly of troops from neighboring
Senegal, are pinned in the capital Bissau.
	   Senegalese soldiers turned back the first aid trucks sent to
reach displaced people in Prabis, a small town near Bissau, World
Food Program spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said Tuesday in
Geneva.
	   The three-truck convoy had to return to Bissau because the
soldiers said it lacked the necessary authorization.
	   Some 70,000 to 100,000 people in Prabis have not received any
supplies since Oct. 18, Berthiaume said.
	   Guinea-Bissau, wedged between Senegal and the Republic of
Guinea, is one of the world's poorest countries, with an average
annual income of about dlrs 250 per capita in 1997.

Latest corruption trial against Italy's Berlusconi to wait until

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The latest trial of Italian opposition
leader Silvio Berlusconi, an ex-premier already convicted three
times this year in corruption cases, was put off Tuesday until Jan.
12.
	   The court postponed the start of the trial on a technicality,
agreeing with one party's complaint that service of subpoenas had
been mishandled.
	   Berlusconi is charged with false bookkeeping to conceal dlrs 6
million in illegal contributions in 1991 to the Socialist Party of
then-Premier Bettino Craxi.
	   Berlusconi, leader of Italy's conservative opposition, has
already been convicted in a separate trial of making the
contributions. He was fined dlrs 5.6 million and sentenced to 28
months in prison in July.
	   Also in July, Berlusconi was convicted of bribing tax inspectors
and sentenced to 33 months. In December, he was convicted of fraud
in a film company deal and given a suspended sentence of 16 months.
All three convictions are on appeal.
	   Berlusconi, who served as premier for seven months in 1994, has
consistently denied wrongdoing in all the cases against him and
portrayed himself as the target of a political vendetta by leftist
prosecutors.

Former president, Islamic leader call for Algerian peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A group of Algerians, including a former
president and an Islamic militant leader, have launched an appeal
for a summit to promote peace in this violence-plagued North
African country.
	   The call for a ``popular congress for peace and national
reconciliation'' was published in several Algerian newspapers
Tuesday.
	   The summit would unite people seeking a ``global solution'' to
Algeria's more than six-year Islamic insurgency ahead of
presidential elections scheduled for early next year, the group
said.
	   An insurgency that erupted after Algeria's military-backed
government canceled January 1992 elections the Islamic Salvation
Front was set to win has left more than 75,000 people dead.
	   The group based the need for a peace conclave on ``the gravity''
of Algeria's current situation which it said was a result of the
government's ``pursuit of policies that have failed to stop the
bloodshed.''
	   The eight-man group includes Algeria's first president, Ahmed
Ben Bella, Abdelkader Hachani, the No. 3 man of the now-banned
Islamic Salvation Front, and Abdelhamed Mehri, former head of the
National Liberation Front, the party that ruled this North African
nation for nearly three decades.
	   Meanwhile, most courtrooms around the country were reported
virtually empty for a second consecutive day Tuesday, as judges
continued a three-day strike. The National Union of Magistrates
said about 80 percent of judges were observing the strike, with
only urgent cases being heard.
	   The judges are protesting an article published Oct. 7 in the
privately-owned daily El Watan calling judges ``incapable.''
	   The strike comes on the heels of a two-week walkout at
state-owned Air Algeria, as well as strike action at Algerian
newspapers and universities.
	   The walkouts have added to the already charged atmosphere in the
run up to presidential elections. In September, President Liamine
Zeroual announced plans to cut short his term, set to end in the
year 2000, and hold elections before the end of February.

Report: Brazil thwarts Chilean proposal for joint South American
</HEADLINE>
plea for Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil blocked a Chilean proposal for a
joint petition to England for the release of former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet, media reported Tuesday.
	   Major newspapers said Chile's President Eduardo Frei discussed
the idea with six Southern American presidents gathered here Monday
for the signing of a peace treaty between Peru and Ecuador.
	   Frei reportedly argued that the 82-year-old Pinochet was sick
and could die before going to trial. Spain wants to extradite
Pinochet from England for questioning on the death of Spanish
citizens during his bloody 1973-1990 dictatorship.
	   But Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso _ who was
exiled during Brazil's 1964-85 military regime _ balked at signing
the note and the idea was dropped, media said.
	   ``For lack of support from the party's host, President Frei
returned to Santiago without obtaining the joint letter, with which
he imagined he could insist more strongly with the British
government for Pinochet's release,'' the Rio de Janeiro daily O
Globo said.
	   Cardoso's press office said he and Frei had met privately but
the subject of Pinochet didn't come up.
	   The Chilean embassy canceled a press conference scheduled with
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza. Frei refused to comment on
the Pinochet case, saying he already had done so at home.

Belarus invites foreign ambassadors back to diplomatic compound
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarus is inviting foreign ambassadors to
return to a diplomatic compound they were evicted from this summer,
officials said Tuesday.
	   The United States and several European countries recalled their
ambassadors to protest the move, which they said violated
international law.
	   President Alexander Lukashenko's government said it needed to
repair the plumbing and sewage system in the Drozdy compound in a
pine grove on the outskirts of the capital, Minsk. The ambassadors
maintained Belarus had no right to force them out.
	   Lukashenko then claimed that the compound, located down the
street from his own home, was part of the presidential residence.
	   ``We have proposed several nations that their ambassadors return
to Drozdy on certain conditions,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Igor
Poluyan told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
	   He refused to say which countries or elaborate on the conditions
for their return.
	   Belarusian Foreign Minister Ivan Antonovich said in a television
interview Monday that the government had repaired the residence of
the Turkish ambassador and invited her to come back.
	   A spokesman for the ambassador said Tuesday that Turkey hadn't
yet responded to the Belarusian proposal.
	   The European Union and nearly a dozen other countries imposed
travel restrictions on Belarusian officials over the dispute, which
has further clouded relations between Belarus and the West, long
critical of Lukashenko's authoritarian policies.

NATO reviews airstrike threat after Serbs pull back in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting started, latest reports of Serb pull out;
EDITS to conform &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ As Serb troops redeployed in Kosovo to
meet international demands, NATO ambassadors were deciding Tuesday
whether to lift or extend the threat of allied airstrikes beyond
the evening deadline.
	   Reports from Kosovo suggested President Slobodan Milosevic had
made a significant pullback of his military and police forces in
the province to avert NATO intervention.
	   But as NATO's policy-making North Atlantic Council started talks
2 1/2 hours ahead of the 1900 GMT deadline, officials at alliance
headquarters said it was unclear if Milosevic had done enough to
get the airstrike threat lifted.
	   Alliance officials said the Serb withdrawal made airstrikes very
unlikely, but added that NATO was not expected to remove the threat
completely.
	   Instead, the council of ambassadors from the 16 NATO nations was
seen either setting a new deadline for complete compliance, or
extending indefinitely the ``activation order'' keeping some 400
allied warplanes on alert for possible raids against the Serbs.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a BBC interview
that NATO should not yet drop its guard despite ``serious
progress'' made by Milosevic toward meeting international demands.
	   ``He still has some way to go and it may well be wise for us to
keep that threat hanging over him,'' Cook said.
	   Convoys of tanks and trucks carrying Yugoslav troops and police
pulled out of several parts of Kosovo on Tuesday, indicating
Milosevic had ordered compliance with international demands to
reduce Serb forces in Kosovo to levels before the conflict with
ethnic Albanian separatists flared February.
	   In Washington, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said
Milosevic had withdrawn ``well over 90 percent of the security
force reinforcements.''
	   ``Thanks to NATO pressure and determination, very substantial
steps have been taken toward compliance,'' Lockhard added.
	   The private Yugoslav radio station B-92 quoted Serb sources as
saying the withdrawal was complete and that government forces in
Kosovo were back to preconflict levels. A representative of the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army also confirmed the withdrawal,
although he expressed concern about its long-term impact.
	   NATO ambassadors were studying reports from international
observers on the ground in Kosovo and NATO military, who are
operating unarmed observer flights over the province as part of the
Oct. 12 agreement between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   NATO sources said the ambassadors would likely wait until
shortly before the deadline to declare whether Milosevic met the
conditions.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic is
refusing to back down on his ongoing purge of Serbia's fledgling
independent media, a special U.S. envoy said Tuesday.
	   Speaking to representatives of independent Serbian media, U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill promised he would further press the issue
with the autocratic Yugoslav president when he they met later
Tuesday.
	   ``I assure you I have raised the issue at the highest level here
very forcefully,'' Hill told reporters. ``I am sorry to say... we
don't seem to have ... results.''
	   Last week, Serbian parliament passed a new media law, severely
restricting press freedoms and instituting sky-high fines for those
publishing ``antipatriotic'' and ``antigovernment'' stories.
	   ``You can not wipe out independent media any more than you can
deprive people of oxygen,'' Hill said, adding the new law was
``something not in keeping with the standards of Europe and the
rest of the international community.''
	   Veran Matic, of a Belgrade-based association of independent
media, handed Hill his association's plans for fighting the new
law, warning peace in Kosovo was not possible without free media in
Serbia.
	   Also on Tuesday, another independent daily, NT Plus, halted
publication after telephone threats to its chief editor, Momcilo
Djogovic.
	   ``The new media law has turned into a widespread lynching of
journalists,'' Djogovic said, adding his newspaper would not appear
on the stands under these ``absurd conditions.''

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch roared through the
northwestern Caribbean with heart-stopping strength Tuesday,
churning up high waves and intense rain that sent coastal residents
of Honduras fleeing for safer ground.
	   President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum
alert and the Honduran military sent planes to evacuate residents
from their homes on islands near the coast. Floods struck poor
coastal neighborhoods.
	   At 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT), Mitch was 90 miles (145 kilometers)
north of Honduras and moving west, parallel to the coast, at 6 mph
(10 kph). With winds near 165 mph (265 kph), and even more violent
gusts, the 350-mile-wide (565-kilometer-wide) hurricane was a
Category 5 monster _ the highest, most dangerous rating for a
storm.
	   ``Mitch is closing in,'' said Monterrey Cardenas, mayor of
Utila, an island 20 miles (30 kilometers) off the Honduran coast.
``And God help us.''
	   Earlier in the day, when Mitch's winds were at 180 mph, the U.S.
National Weather Service said only three Atlantic storms were
stronger than Mitch _ Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980 and the Labor
Day hurricane of 1935.

Israel cites U.S. support in warning Palestinians on security
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTS to remove periods from slug &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Tuesday maintained that it had U.S.
backing for its warning that there would be no West Bank troop
withdrawal unless Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority made good
on its security pledges.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is enmeshed in a fight for his
political survival with hard-liners vowing to bolt his coalition
and force early elections which could freeze implementation of the
Wye River accord.
	   Israeli officials are particularly concerned about continuing
attacks by Palestinian militants and complain they have not yet
received a Palestinian action plan for fighting terrorism. Unless
it is received by Friday, the withdrawal timetable could be
delayed, one official said on condition of anonymity.
	   In support of its position, Netanyahu's office released a letter
to the Israeli leader from U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in which she affirmed that each stage of the Wye River
accord would have to be completed before moving on.
	   ``We believe its parallel phased approach will help provide
greater confidence to both sides in the implementation process,
since actions in each stage of the time line are to be completed by
both sides before moving to the next stage,'' the letter said.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, pointed to the letter
as evidence that ``unless there is a fulfillment of Palestinian
obligations and compliance there will be no withdrawal.''
	   Albright, in a letter dated Oct. 23, assured Netanyahu there
were ``procedures in place,'' to prevent what Israel terms a
revolving door policy of arresting Palestinian terror suspects and
then releasing them without punishment.
	   ``Furthermore, we will express our opposition to any unwarranted
releases of such suspects, and in the event of such a release, we
will be prepared to express our position publicly,'' the letter
said.
	   She pledged that the United States would brief Israel
periodically on efforts to confiscate illegal arms.
	   Albright restated ``our ironclad commitment to Israel's security
and to peace, and to stress that Palestinian security undertakings
are a critical foundation of the (Wye River) Memorandum.''
	   Bar-Illan described the political situation Netanyahu is in as
``very touch-and-go.''
	   ``The only thing that will settle it is compliance by the
Palestinians and adherence by the U.S. administration to all its
promises regarding compliance by the Palestinians. That will enable
the coalition to be stabilized,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Netanyahu told reporters that implementing the agreement would
only be affected by Palestinian compliance or a negative vote in
his 18-member Cabinet, which is deeply uneasy about the Wye accord
but is expected to approve it.
	   ``The only thing that can prevent the implementation of the
agreement is if the (Israeli) Cabinet does not approve it, or if
the Palestinians do not fulfill it,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Referring to the slaying of a Jewish settler in the West Bank
town of Hebron Monday, Netanyahu said he expected the Palestinian
leadership to condemn the bloodshed, which it has not yet done.
	   ``We expect a denunciation, and we also expect action, full
co-operation in the field of security,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Later, Palestinian police arrested two suspects in the killing
of the settler, Danny Vargas. The Palestinians also allowed Israeli
investigators to cross into their sector of Hebron to investigate
the killing.

Haitian legislators' hostility mounts toward U.N. civilian police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Appealing to national pride,
Haitian lawmakers insisted Tuesday that U.N. advisers who are
training Haiti's young police force must leave the country once a
U.N. mandate expires next month.
	   Their demands pose a political dilemma for President Rene
Preval, who accepted a law in August ordering the withdrawal of all
foreign armed forces from Haiti but is under U.S. pressure to keep
the advisers. It's up to Preval to request an extension of the U.N.
mission, which expires Nov. 30.
	   ``We think it is a good thing for the country. The Haitian
national police are still young and inexperienced,'' U.S. Embassy
spokeswoman Mary-Ellen Gilroy told Radio Metropole on Tuesday.
	   No one questions the need to keep training Haiti's 3-year-old
police force, but Haitian lawmakers say the advisers should be
replaced by Haitian instructors.
	   Seventy-five Haitian instructors have received basic training
and could soon be ready to take over from U.N. officers, Police
Chief Pierre Denize said.
	   Haiti's police force was created after the United States invaded
in September 1994 to oust a military-backed regime and restore an
elected government that had been overthrown in 1991.
	   Former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide dissolved Haiti's
repressive 7,500-strong army, and a 6,000-member police force,
hastily trained by foreign instructors, was deployed in June 1995.
	   In August, Haitian lawmakers passed the bill ordering foreign
troops out. While the U.N. mission technically consists of 284
civilian police instructors, it also includes 144 Argentine
gendarmes to protect them.
	   Independent Sen. Samuel Madistin said the Haitian law applies to
the U.N. mission as well as a 500-member U.S. non-combat mission
that provides humanitarian assistance to Haitians. The U.S. mission
has an open-ended mandate.
	   Madistin said lawmakers had no objection to foreigners
instructing Haitian police, ``provided they are not members of a
foreign armed force.''
	   If Preval ignores the law and requests a U.N. extension, ``he
will be in violation of the Constitution and face possible
impeachment proceedings,'' said Sen. Irvelt Chery, spokesman for
the majority Struggling People's Organization party.
	   Former U.S. national security adviser Anthony Lake visited
Preval last weekend in part to discuss the U.N. mandate, Radio
Vision 2000 reported. Preval hasn't made any public comment on the
subject since last year, when he said that the 1997-1998 extension
of the U.N. mandate would be the last.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has suggested that an
extension might be required. ``It is now widely accepted that there
will be a continuing need for international training,'' he stated
in an August report.

Spiritual leader calls on party to oppose peace deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu, Sharon meeting Shapira, ADDS Byline &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The spiritual leader of a powerful religious
party called on his followers to reject a new Mideast peace
agreement Tuesday in which Israel is to hand over West Bank land to
Palestinian control.
	   Rabbi Avraham Shapira, considered the spiritual leader of the
National Religious Party and extremely influential over Jewish
settlers, ruled that it is forbidden to ``give a hand to this
horrible agreement.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon were to meet Shapira later Tuesday, Netanyahu's spokesman
Aviv Bushinsky said, in order to explain the deal to the elderly
rabbi.
	   ``They will discuss coalition issues and try to convince the NRP
to support the Wye agreement,'' Bushinsky said.
	   Many religious Jews believe that the West Bank is part of the
biblical land of Israel promised to Jews by God and that leaving it
constitutes sin.
	   As a result, the settlers and their government backers from
parties such as NRP, members of Netanyahu's coalition, oppose the
peace deal signed with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat which calls
for the transfer of 13.1 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians.
	   In 1995, when then-prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was moving to
withdraw Israeli troops, from Palestinian cities, settlers and
right-wing politicians demonstrated violently against the plans,
painting Rabin as a traitor. In November of that year, Rabin was
assassinated by a right-wing religious Jew who opposed
land-for-peace.
	   With the third anniversary of Rabin's death approaching, calls
from those same group branding Netanyahu a traitor with blood on
his hands, stirred concern in Israel that a political killing could
come again.
	   ``I hope we won't repeat a horrible mistake,'' said President
Ezer Weizman.
	   Asked on Israel radio whether another assassination was
possible, Benny Elon, a lawmaker from the ultra-nationalist Moledet
party answered ``yes, of course.''
	   Israeli media reported this week that security had been
increased for Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai after
the two returned from last week's Mideast summit outside
Washington.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Accusing its coalition partners of
rejecting all its initiatives, Romania's Alternative Party (PAR)
decided Tuesday to leave the ruling coalition and withdraw its
single minister and a state secretary from the government.
	   The Alternative Party has only six seats out of 287 held by the
multi-party coalition in the 486-seat legislature.
	   The head of the party ,Varujan Vosganian, said his group will
form a new rightist opposition ``to counterbalance the already
existing leftist opposition.'' He did not elaborate.
	   Ion Diaconescu, the head of the Democratic Convention - a
political coalition in which Vosganian's party was a member - said
he regretted their partner's decision.
	   The minister of research and a state secretary in the reform
ministry, members of the Alternative Party, will formally resign
Thursday at the next Cabinet meeting.
	   Since November 1996 when reformist parties came to power vowing
to reform the flagging economy, they were torn by bickering and
reforms have slowed down.

ANC fires back at leaked Truth Commission findings
</HEADLINE>

which being dropped as a separate story &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The ruling African National
Congress fired back Tuesday at a leaked Truth and Reconciliation
Commission finding that it violated human rights during the
anti-apartheid struggle.
	   The commission exploring apartheid's horrors says the ANC
committed the violations by planting mines in rural areas,
executing enemy agents and blurring the line between military and
civilian targets, according to the commission's preliminary
findings which were leaked to the media on Monday.
	   The commission's 3,500-page report that culminates more than two
years of nationwide hearings is to be formally handed to President
Nelson Mandela on Thursday, a milestone in South Africa's
transformation from white minority rule to democracy.
	   The commission was charged with promoting reconciliation by
laying bare apartheid-era atrocities. But even before the report's
release, it has caused friction.
	   ANC Secretary-General Kgalema Motlanthe called the leaked
findings ``baseless'' and said they contained ``glaring
inaccuracies.''
	   Motlanthe said in a statement the Truth Commisson had rebuffed
the ANC's attempts to hold a meeting to give a response to the
preliminary findings.
	   The ANC instead gave a written response, Motlanthe said, without
divulging what the response contained. He also did not specify what
findings were baseless or inconsistent.
	   The report's overwhelming blame will doubtless be laid on white
governments and their security forces during the years under
scrutiny, 1960-94.
	   Lawyers for former President F.W. de Klerk will on Wednesday ask
a court to prevent the Truth Commission's report from implicating
him in apartheid crimes, a spokesman said.
	   The filing had been scheduled for Tuesday, but lawyers for the
Truth Commission were not yet ready.
	   ``As I understand it the TRC lawyers need more time to read the
legal papers,'' said de Klerk's advisor, David Steward.
	   De Klerk wants the High Court in Cape Town to stop the Truth
Commission from concluding that he was ``an accessory after the
fact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church
group and of a labor federation.
	   Lawyers for de Klerk will ask the court for a publication ban.
	   In its report, the commission is expected to say that although
de Klerk did not order the bombings, he subsequently came to know
about the roles of former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and
Johan van der Merwe, a former police commissioner, but failed to
report the information to police.
	   The finding could pave the way for the de Klerk's prosecution
because he did not seek amnesty in connection with the bombings of
the buildings that housed anti-apartheid groups.
	   De Klerk's lawyers are expected to contend that when he learned
about the bombings, Vlok and Van der Merwe were already in the
process of applying for amnesty, and he did not think it was
necessary to report the matter to the police.
	   The Truth Commission can grant amnesty to those who fully
confess to politically motivated crimes committed during apartheid.
	   News reports Monday said the Truth Commission would declare
apartheid a crime against humanity and acknowledge the ANC's fight
against the former apartheid state was legitimate.

Russia's economic crisis tastes bitter to candy industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The economic crisis has brought sour times to
Russia's candy makers, which until recently were among the few
thriving businesses in the country, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Candy output in September was 13 percent lower than in August,
and 15 percent lower than September 1997, said the head of Russia's
Association of Confectionery Factories, Viktor Sharshapin,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   About 60 percent of raw materials used by the Russian
confectionery industry are imports. The devaluation of the ruble in
mid-August left candy factories with little money to pay for
imported cocoa and other products, Sharshapin said.
	   The confectionery association wants the government to lower
import taxes on cocoa, nuts and other candy materials, and raise
taxes on imported candy to help Russian manufacturers survive, the
report said.
	   Russia's confectionery industry was among the few in the country
that made high-quality, popular products, and paid relatively high
wages.
	   It is also among the country's top ten taxpayers. Last year, the
industry provided 791 million rubles (dlrs 132 million) in taxes to
the federal budget, and 875 million rubles (dlrs 146 million) to
local budgets, Sharshapin said.

Controversial mass trial of suspected Islamic militants closes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FLEURY MEROGIS, France (AP) _ France's biggest trial, featuring
138 defendants accused of helping Islamic militants in Algeria,
closed on Tuesday, two months after opening in a prison gym.
	   The verdict will be rendered January 22, the court said.
	   The trial, which started Sept. 1, has been marked by controversy
from the start, with the majority of defense lawyers refusing to
attend the two-month-long proceedings.
	   The lawyers, protesting ``mass justice'' and the ``undignified''
setting _ a gym by the Fleury Merogis prison nearly an hour's drive
south of Paris _ maintained their boycott on the final day.
	   Mohamed Kerrouche, a leading defendant, praised the lawyers'
protest during his final defense.
	   Prosecutors contend the suspects made up three separate but
overlapping networks to help the insurgency in Algeria, where
violence since 1992 has left an estimated 75,000 people dead.
	   The prosecution alleges that Kerrouche, Mohamed Tacine and
Mohamed Chalabi headed the three networks.
	   Prosecutor Bernard Fos has demanded a maximum 10-year sentence
for each of the three. He demanded that 68 defendants, most of them
Algerians, be banned from France.
	   The defendants were arrested in police sweeps around France in
1994 and 1995.
	   They are charged with providing support for Islamic insurgents
in Algeria by sending arms, money and medical supplies to fighters
or providing documents and refuge for Muslim militants brought to
France.
	   Police confiscated arms, propaganda and other incriminating
evidence during the sweeps.

Brazil to reveal new austerity steps; Pressure on Cardoso to follow
</HEADLINE>
through &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Will be led following Cardoso speech on outline of the plan,
scheduled to begin at 2200 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ When a financial crisis in Asia
threatened emerging markets worldwide last November, Brazil earned
high marks for quickly announcing a package of austerity measures
to shore up its ailing economy and protect its currency.
	   Few of those measures were ever put in place. Now with Brazil on
the front lines of the global financial crisis, President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso is preparing to unveil yet another package of tax
increases and budget cuts.
	   The big question now is whether the latest package will fare
better than the last.
	   ``A lot of the measures that should be announced .... were
supposed have been done a year ago,'' said Adalto Lima, an
economist with Lloyds Bank.
	   While the full details will only be announced Wednesday by
Finance Minister Pedro Malan, rumors about what the package will
entail have been circulating in the local press for weeks.
	   According to these unconfirmed reports, the package should
involve three basic items: a tax increase, spending cuts and
structural reforms to social security and civil service.
	   The steps are seen shoring up investor confidence and making the
country more eligible for an aid package from the International
Monetary Fund.
	   Although none of the measures are likely to be popular _ a major
reason why Cardoso held off announcing the plan until after
Sunday's runoff elections for governors in 13 states _ some
economists think that the steps have more chance of passing then
they did last year in the runup to an election.
	   Despite the delay in revealing the austerity measures,
opposition governors won in several key races. Since governors in
Brazil often hold greater influence over congressmen from their
states than the president does, Cardoso may still have some
difficulty getting his measures through the congress.
	   But the pressure remains high on Cardoso to follow through on
his promises to get Brazil's economy going again.
	   ``In the past, Brazil got so many waivers (about not meeting
established goals) from the IMF that Cardoso really has to shore up
confidence or in the country or people won't take it seriously
anymore,'' said Walder de Gois, president of the Brazilian
Institute of Political Studies.

Workers fired after Russian hot water pipe eruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Several utility employees have been fired after
hot water pipes ruptured near St. Petersburg, killing a man and a
child and scalding nine others, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Water as hot as 140 degrees C (284 degrees F) burst from pipes
in 30 locations across a northern suburb of Russia's second-largest
city on Oct. 16.
	   The pipes exploded during tests usually done before winter to
make sure they can withstand high levels of water pressure, but
many of the pipes are old and do not always survive the tests.
	   The test was ``insufficiently prepared,'' a city government
commission ruled after investigating the incident, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Many of the pipes were older than their service life, not enough
workers were present during the test, and some areas were not
fenced off, the report said.
	   Several people deemed responsible for the accident have been
fired, it said.

Searching for cash, Russia expects record oil exports this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Primakov receiving promises of EU support in 15th graf,
CORRECTS barrel conversion in 7th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Desperate for cash to pay off huge foreign debts,
Russia's government is driving oil exports to a record high,
abandoning pledges to cut sales to reduce oil surplus on world
markets, an official said Tuesday.
	   Russia will have to pay about dlrs 3 billion toward its foreign
debt this year and about dlrs 18 billion next year.
	   To come up with the money, the government is driving up oil
exports, Russia's top foreign-currency earner. ``This year will in
fact be a record high,'' Energy Minister Sergei Generalov said. He
gave no exact figures, but Russian news agencies said exports would
be 115 million to 116 million metric tons (805 million to 811
million barrels) this year.
	   The reason ``is clear _ the lack of any other sources of cash,''
Generalov said.
	   Russia last year experienced its first economic growth since the
Soviet collapse, but hopes for more of the same were dashed when a
new economic crisis erupted in August. Since then, the government's
chronic cash-flow problems have grown even worse.
	   Russia promised the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries earlier this year to cut oil exports, because surplus oil
on world markets has kept prices low.
	   But the country has shown no signs of doing so. Russia exported
62.5 million tons (437.4 million barrels) of crude in the first six
months of 1998, up 10 percent from the same period last year.
Generalov said exports for the second half would be only slightly
lower.
	   However, low oil prices _ about dlrs 14 a barrel _ mean that the
government is unlikely to see a large increase in revenues.
	   Meanwhile, former Economics Minister Yakov Urinson said Russia's
economy is headed into a ``dead end'' because of the government's
failure to begin real economic reforms.
	   The government is replacing ``real money with surrogates'' _
such as barter and deferred payments, Urinson was quoted as saying
by the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia's Cabinet on Monday devised a vague economic program,
which some worry may be a veil for plans to return to a command
economy.
	   ``No matter how many masks the government tries, the face of the
economic program stays the same: the resolution of the crisis is to
be provided by a harsh interference of the state in the economy,''
the influential business daily Kommersant said in a front-page
story Tuesday.
	   The government will present an economic plan to to the
International Monetary Fund on Saturday, deputy Prime Minister Yuri
Maslyukov said, according to Interfax.
	   The IMF wants to see a sound economic plan implemented before
releasing more of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package negotiated
this summer.
	   In Vienna on Tuesday, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov received
promises of European Union support for the government's reform
efforts but no new financial commitments.
	   Government officials have denied suggestions that Russia needs
humanitarian aid from the West. But 26 of the country's regions
want donations of food and medicines, deputy Prime Minister
Valentina Matviyenko said Tuesday.

Turkish comedian cancels popular show to protest censorship

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ One of Turkey's leading entertainers
stopped his long-running TV show Tuesday, protesting a one-day
blackout of his channel imposed for a parody of a Cabinet
minister's public declaration of her virginity.
	   Turkey's radio and television board ordered the blackout on
Kanal D television station last week after a skit by Levent Kirca
mocked Women and Family Affairs Minister Isilay Saygin.
	   The broadcast board said the skit was ``hurtful'' and an
``assault on Saygin's personality,'' Kanal D said.
	   The board is empowered to black out stations it judges to be
politically biased, slanderous or offensive. It has come under
increasing criticism by both mainstream and pro-Islamic stations,
which accuse it of unjustly limiting freedom of expression.
	   ``My team and I protest this archaic incident ... and invite the
board to think, stop this archaic policy and overturn its
decision,'' Kirca told reporters.
	   Kirca's weekly parodies of life in Turkey have been running for
more than 10 years. The series has won popular acclaim for subtly
criticizing torture and other human rights abuses in the country.
	   Kirca did not say when _ or if _ his show would resume.
	   In an Oct. 4 interview with Hurriyet newspaper, Saygin, who
raised a storm earlier this year by urging virginity tests for
girls, portrayed herself as a workaholic who has no time for love
affairs.
	   ``I am still a virgin. I had a fiance 27 years ago but we never

Oldest reptile nest discovered in Arizona
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Geologists have identified the world's oldest
known reptile nests, establishing that protective parenting habits
developed much earlier in the history of life than previously
believed.
	   The 62 bowl-like depressions in a sandstone layer in Arizona's
Petrified Forest National Park were dated at 220 million years old,
twice as old as any previously known reptile nests.
	   The nests _ holes in the sand that over time turned into stone _
were probably made by crocodile-like creatures called phytosaurs or
by aetosaurs, which were armored reptiles, said Stephen Hasiotis, a
consulting geologist for Exxon who discovered the sites.
	   Other scientists said the discovery suggests that at least 220
million years ago during the Triassic Period, some vertebrates
stopped laying their eggs directly on the ground and started
protecting them in nests.
	   ``This shows that these guys were digging nests into the banks
of rivers much earlier than we thought,'' said Jim Kirkland of the
Dinamation International Society, which makes scientifically
accurate dinosaur robots and displays.
	   Hasiotis discovered the fossil nests in 1996 when he was a
research associate at the University of Colorado. He said he
frequently walked past the dozens of depressions without realizing
their significance.
	   Only in the twilight did he recognize their nest-like features _
smooth sides, a rim and partial footprints trampling what once was
the sandy shoreline of an ancient river.
	   The following year, Anthony Martin of Emory University helped
Hasiotis identify and date the nests. They presented their research
at a meeting of the Geological Society of America being held this
week in Toronto.
	   Hasiotis has been credited with pushing back the ages of the
oldest bee, termite nests and the oldest crayfish by tens of
millions of years.
	   No eggs or shell fragments were found in the Arizona nests. The
walls of the nests appear to have been compacted, a feature shared
with the nesting sites of modern-day crocodiles, which stay near
their nests and guard their eggs from predators.
	   Like modern animals, the ancient creatures might have dug
several test holes before deciding on the right location.
	   The best samples are protected except for narrow openings that
probably served as egg chambers. Overlying them are broad
depressions known as body pits that probably were made by the
weight of the egg-laying females.
	   The oldest reptile fossils are dated to about 300 million years
old. Prior to the Arizona discovery, the oldest fossil nest of any
kind was a 110 million-year-old sea turtle nest. It was located on
the dry plains of eastern Colorado on what was the coast of a
shallow, ancient sea.
	   Paleontologist Gale Bishop of Georgia Southern University, one
of the turtle nest experts, described the Arizona discovery as
``quite convincing.''
	   The Arizona nests do little to resolve one of the hottest
debates in paleontology: How helpless were baby dinosaurs?
	   Many researchers believe that dinosaur babies hatched
soft-boned, blind and helpless, like baby birds. They argue that
dinosaur adults were tender, caring parents and that the young
remained in the nest for feeding and protection.
	   But recent analyses of some dinosaur embryos suggest they were
born with strong bones and muscles in order to immediately avoid
predators, much like modern alligators and ostriches.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ On an island more densely populated
than Japan, Puerto Rican lawmakers want to conserve land by putting
a sales tax on plots little bigger than a tennis court.
	   A bill pending in the U.S. territory's Senate would tack a dlrs
1 to dlrs 5 charge on every square meter over 250 square meters
(2,800 square feet), with the fee increasing with the amount of
land bought. The money would be used to buy land for parks and
public forests.
	   ``We're basically creating a user's fee for land,'' said Sen.
Kenneth McClintock, who co-authored the bill. ``If you want to have
a nice yard like I have, you'll pay for it.''
	   Lawmakers say such controls are necessary on an island that has
1,035 people per mile (414 per square kilometer) _ 14 times the
U.S. average _ and invested dlrs 4.7 billion in construction last
year.
	   Since 1962, Puerto Rico has lost nearly a third of its
agricultural land, the San Juan Star newspaper reported this week.
Its population density tops Japan's, which has 861 people per
square mile (344 per square kilometer).
	   New housing projects have blossomed on former pineapple and
coconut plantations in the northeast. The government is building a
47-mile (78-kilometer) ``superaqueduct'' to serve them because
experts warn that the region's reservoirs cannot handle the load
during dry spells.
	   Worries that development is going unchecked in San Juan prompted
the Senate to pass a moratorium on construction in the southern
part of the city. That bill is pending in the House of
Representatives.
	   The legislature also reserved 400 acres (162 hectares) in San
Juan as an ``urban forest'' despite grumbling from transportation
officials who wanted to build a highway there.
	   The tax bill would raise between dlrs 10 million and dlrs 20
million annually, McClintock said. Sixty percent would go toward
land purchases and 40 percent to land management.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Hosts Nigeria and Ghana won victories
Tuesday to reach the finals of the African women's soccer
championships and qualify for the Women's World Cup next year.
	   Nigeria beat Cameroon 6-0 while Ghana overcame Republic of Congo
4-1 in extra time in the semifinals of the African championships.
The finals will be played in Abeokuta, about 50 kilometers (30
miles) north of the commercial capital of Lagos on Saturday.
	   Including Tuesday's game, Nigeria scored a goal margin of 26-0
in four lopsided wins over its opponents, which also included
Egypt, Morroco and Congo.
	   Ghana won its two earlier matches by a combined goal ratio of
6-3 against Cameroon and South Africa. A third match was canceled
when Lesotho failed to send a team.
	   With their wins, Ghana and Nigeria automatically earned places
in the 1999 Women's World Cup in the United States from June 19 to
July 10.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ As Serb troops redeployed in Kosovo to
meet international demands, NATO ambassadors were deciding Tuesday
whether to lift or extend the threat of allied airstrikes beyond
the evening deadline.
	   Reports from Kosovo suggested President Slobodan Milosevic had
made a significant pullback of his military and police forces in
the province to avert NATO intervention.
	   NATO ambassadors ended their meeting today just before the 1900
GMT deadline passed for Milosevic to pull back his forces in
Kosovo. Alliance officials said the Serb withdrawal made airstrikes
unlikely, but there was no immediate announcement of the results of
the ambassadors' session.
	   Earlier, Alliance officials said the Serb withdrawal made
airstrikes very unlikely, but added that NATO was not expected to
remove the threat completely.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ One of Turkey's leading entertainers
stopped his long-running TV show Tuesday, protesting a one-day
blackout of his channel imposed for a parody of a Cabinet
minister's public declaration of her virginity.
	   Turkey's radio and television board ordered the blackout on
Kanal D television station last week after a skit by Levent Kirca
mocked Women and Family Affairs Minister Isilay Saygin.
	   The broadcast board said the skit was ``hurtful'' and an
``assault on Saygin's personality,'' Kanal D said.
	   The board is empowered to black out stations it judges to be
politically biased, slanderous or offensive. It has come under
increasing criticism by both mainstream and pro-Islamic stations,
which accuse it of unjustly limiting freedom of expression.
	   ``My team and I protest this archaic incident ... and invite the
board to think, stop this archaic policy and overturn its
decision,'' Kirca told reporters.
	   Kirca's weekly parodies of life in Turkey have been running for
more than 10 years. The series has won popular acclaim for subtly
criticizing torture and other human rights abuses in the country.
	   Kirca did not say when _ or if _ his show would resume.
	   In an Oct. 4 interview with Hurriyet newspaper, Saygin, who
raised a storm earlier this year by urging virginity tests for
girls, portrayed herself as a workaholic who has no time for love
affairs.
	   ``I am still a virgin. I had a fiance 27 years ago but we never
were together,'' Saygin, 52, was quoted as telling Hurriyet.
	   ``Even if I were to find a man now, he would leave me the second
day, after seeing the way I live.''

Israel cites U.S. support in warning Palestinians on security
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS top to lead with Cabinet debate postponed, Israeli
statement; State Department comment in graf 11 &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel postponed a crucial Cabinet debate
Tuesday on the new Mideast accord and said it had U.S. backing for
its warning that there would be no West Bank troop withdrawal
unless Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority made good on its
security pledges.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is enmeshed in a fight for his
political survival with hard-liners vowing to bolt his coalition
and force early elections which could freeze implementation of the
Wye River accord.
	   Israeli officials are particularly concerned about continuing
attacks by Palestinian militants and complain they have not yet
received a Palestinian action plan for fighting terrorism. Unless
it is received by Friday, the withdrawal timetable could be
delayed, one official said on condition of anonymity.
	   Netanyahu's office released a statement Tuesday saying a Cabinet
session planned for Thursday to ratify the new accord would be
postponed until the security plan is received.
	   ``It was determined at the Wye Summit that the Palestinians
would, within one week, complete their working plan for fighting
terrorism. However, this evening it became clear that they are not
meeting the agreement scheduled,'' the statement said.
	   ``In light of the foregoing, the Cabinet will convene to approve
the agreement immediately after it has received the aforementioned
working plan.''
	   The postponement will likely push back the implementation of the
new agreement.
	   Netanyahu's office also released a letter to the Israeli leader
from U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in which she
affirmed that each stage of the Wye River accord would have to be
completed before moving on.
	   ``We believe its parallel phased approach will help provide
greater confidence to both sides in the implementation process,
since actions in each stage of the time line are to be completed by
both sides before moving to the next stage,'' the letter said.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, pointed to the letter
as evidence that ``unless there is a fulfillment of Palestinian
obligations and compliance there will be no withdrawal.''
	   State Department spokesman James Rubin would not confirm the
Albright-to-Netanyahu letter or whether any assurances had been
given by the secretary to the Palestinians.
	   Albright, in a letter dated Oct. 23, assured Netanyahu there
were ``procedures in place,'' to prevent what Israel terms a
revolving door policy of arresting Palestinian terror suspects and
then releasing them without punishment.
	   ``Furthermore, we will express our opposition to any unwarranted
releases of such suspects, and in the event of such a release, we
will be prepared to express our position publicly,'' the letter
said.
	   She pledged that the United States would brief Israel
periodically on efforts to confiscate illegal arms.
	   Albright restated ``our ironclad commitment to Israel's security
and to peace, and to stress that Palestinian security undertakings
are a critical foundation of the (Wye River) Memorandum.''
	   Bar-Illan described the political situation Netanyahu is in as
``very touch-and-go.''
	   ``The only thing that will settle it is compliance by the
Palestinians and adherence by the U.S. administration to all its
promises regarding compliance by the Palestinians. That will enable
the coalition to be stabilized,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Netanyahu told reporters that implementing the agreement would
only be affected by Palestinian compliance or a negative vote in
his 18-member Cabinet, which is deeply uneasy about the Wye accord
but is expected to approve it.
	   ``The only thing that can prevent the implementation of the
agreement is if the (Israeli) Cabinet does not approve it, or if
the Palestinians do not fulfill it,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Referring to the slaying of a Jewish settler in the West Bank
town of Hebron Monday, Netanyahu said he expected the Palestinian
leadership to condemn the bloodshed, which it has not yet done.
	   ``We expect a denunciation, and we also expect action, full
co-operation in the field of security,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Later, Palestinian police arrested two suspects in the killing
of the settler, Danny Vargas. The Palestinians also allowed Israeli
investigators to cross into their sector of Hebron to investigate
the killing.

X-rays give away would-be draft dodger in Russian Far East.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 2 grafs at end with police capturing 120 draft-dodgers in
one region, comment from military official. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ For one Russian trying to get out of the autumn
military draft on medical grounds, X-rays proved to be a little too
revealing.
	   The conscript in Russia's Pacific port city of Vladivostok hoped
his X-rays would prove to a doctor that he was not fit to serve in
Russia's army. But one glance by the doctor was enough to determine
they were X-rays of a female pelvis, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   The practice of submitting fake medical tests and X-rays showing
medical problems is widespread among recruits who want to get out
of service in the army, where conditions are miserable and older
soldiers brutally haze younger conscripts.
	   Only about 20 percent of the young men drafted into the military
actually show up.
	   In another Far Eastern region, Khabarovsk, police have detained
and brought to military offices 120 draft dodgers during the
semi-annual fall draft, and are looking for 690 more, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   ``The most cunning draft dodgers buy certificates to show that
they are registered as chronic patients at tuberculosis,
psychiatric and even veterinary clinics,'' a Far Eastern military
commander, Yuri Kobakhidze, was quoted as saying.

	   ZINNWALD, Germany (AP) _ Fifty-nine Afghans were caught Tuesday
crossing the Czech border into Germany, about 30 kilometers (20
miles) south of Dresden, customs officials said.
	   The group, which included 23 children, were hidden on a truck
loaded with sheet metal that bore a license number pervasively
noted by border police for smuggling cigarettes into Germany.
	   The truck driver and the illegal aliens were apprehended and
turned over by customs agents to German border police.
	   Customs officials did not provide any other details on the
group, but numerous foreigners caught illegally entering Germany
over the Czech border in the past have been returned to the Czech
Republic, which is considered a safe haven for refugees.
	   German officials have reported hundreds of refugees attempting
to illegally enter the country over the past several months,
especially from the troubled Yugoslav province of Kosovo. Most have
been caught near the Czech border.

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces scrambled Tuesday
as the NATO deadline passed for pulling back in Kosovo, and the
Clinton administration said the Serbs were in ``substantial
compliance'' with the Kosovo peace accord.
	   Private radio station B-92 quoted Serb sources as saying the
withdrawal was complete and that government forces in Kosovo were
back to the level before Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched his crackdown against ethnic Albanian militants on Feb.
28.
	   NATO ambassadors ended their meeting Tuesday just before the
1900 gmt deadline passed for Milosevic to pull back his forces in
Kosovo. Alliance officials said the Serb withdrawal made airstrikes
unlikely, but there was no immediate announcement of the results of
the ambassadors' session.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said reports
from the field indicated Milosevic was in ``substantial
compliance'' with terms of the Kosovo peace agreement.
	   ``Well over 90 percent of the security force reinforcements''
have been withdrawn, major road blocks have been dismantled and
heavy weapons have been returned to garrison, Lockhart said. ``As
we see this substantial compliance, we also need to make sure that
coming into compliance isn't the only issue. We need to send the
message that he needs to stay in compliance.''
	   Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 have been driven from
their homes in fighting since Milosevic sent in troops to battle
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and
most want independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The 16-nation NATO alliance has threatened to launch airstrikes
unless Milosevic halts his crackdown and cuts his forces to levels
in place before the conflict began.
	   At their meeting Tuesday in Brussels, Belgium, NATO ambassadors
were not expected to remove the airstrike threat completely,
alliance officials said.
	   Instead, the ambassadors could either set a new deadline for
complete compliance or indefinitely extend the order keeping 400
allied warplanes on alert for possible airstrikes.
	   In Belgrade, the special U.S. mediator for Kosovo, Christopher
Hill, said reports from the field indicated ``substantial
movement,'' but he stopped short of declaring the withdrawal
complete.
	   ``There is an effort to reconfigure the security forces in a way
that we truly hope will reduce the violence substantially,'' Hill
said. ``We also hope this ... moving around of forces, will help
resolve the issue of the displaced ... people who are afraid to
come back to their villages.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, speaking in a BBC
interview, warned NATO should not drop its guard despite ``serious
progress'' by Milosevic. ``He still has some way to go and it may
well be wise for us to keep that threat hanging over him,'' Cook
said.
	   In Geneva, a spokesman for the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army, Bardhyl Mahmuti, called the Yugoslav troop movements nothing
more than an ``illusion.'' Ethnic Albanians maintain the government
troops are withdrawing only temporarily and want NATO to strike.
	   Evidence of the Serb withdrawal included the abandoned Komorane
checkpoint outside Pristina and signs of more movement among
villagers.
	   In Malisevo, a former rebel stronghold 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina, hundreds of ethnic Albanians filled the
streets Tuesday, visiting homes and shops they abandoned when Serb
forces overran the town in July.
	   The crowds vanished after bursts of automatic gunfire rang out
when a small convoy of armored police vehicles rolled into town.
Serb police said the shots came from somewhere in the village and
they did not return fire.
	   About two kilometers (a mile) north of town, uniformed
guerrillas inspected bunkers vacated by Serb police and found a
grenade tied to a tree, with a trip wire set as a booby trap.
	   Such threats prevent most refugees in Kosovo from returning
home. But many have come out of the wilderness because of the
approaching winter to stay with friends and relatives in safe
towns, said U.N. refugee official Kris Janowski. He said about
10,000 are still in the woods.
	   Osman Mazreku, a villager in Malisevo, said he fled to a nearby
town nearly three months ago with his wife, mother and three
children. His elderly father stayed behind, was arrested by police
and has not been seen since, Mazreku said.
	   ``He said 'I'm old and they won't do anything to me,''' Mazreku
said. ``I was afraid something like this would happen.''
	   The top floor of the family's two-story house had been gutted by
flames. Clothing, valuables and garbage were strewn across the
ground floor.
	   ``I'm sorry to see my house in this condition, but I'm happy to
be alive,'' he said. ``I hope they'll let me live here.''

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ As Serb troops redeployed in Kosovo to
meet international demands, NATO ambassadors were deciding Tuesday
whether to lift or extend the threat of allied airstrikes beyond
the evening deadline.
	   Reports from Kosovo suggested President Slobodan Milosevic had
made a significant pullback of his military and police forces in
the province to avert NATO intervention.
	   NATO ambassadors ended their meeting Tuesday just before the
1900 GMT deadline passed for Milosevic to pull back his forces in

Turkey asks Moscow to extradite Kurdish rebel leader

diplomatic protest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey has asked Russia to extradite a
Kurdish rebel leader wanted on charges of heading a terrorist
organization, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
	   Abdullah Ocalan leads the banned Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK,
which has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984.
The conflict has killed about 37,000.
	   Ocalan's whereabouts are unclear.
	   Turkey says he recently left Syria for Russia. But in Moscow,
the Interfax news agency said Monday that the Federal Security
Service has not confirmed Ocalan's presence in Russia.
	   ``Contact is being maintained with the Turkish special services.
We asked them about the possibility of Ocalan's using false
documents to enter Russia,'' the intelligence agency said through a
spokesman, Interfax said.
	   Turkish newspapers have said Ocalan was in hiding in a suburb 30
kilometers (18 miles) west of Moscow.
	   As for Ocalan, he issued a statement last week saying he was
somewhere in Kurdistan, a region that stretches over parts of
Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria.
	   Sermet Atacanli, a spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry,
said a formal request for the extradition had already been lodged
in Moscow.
	   ``We have determined that this man is (in Russia) and have asked
them to return him,'' he said.

Britain invites French teens to sample English soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A group of French teen-agers will arrive in
Britain on Friday to train with some of the country's top soccer
teams.
	   ``We have invited children from France to train at the clubs
that have French players,'' said a spokesman for Prime Minister
Tony Blair, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   He did not have details of how many French youngsters had been
invited or what the training program would encompass.
	   But the spokesman said the teen-agers would be training with
teams such as the Glasgow Rangers in Scotland, Tottenham Hotspur
and the Arsenal Gunners in north London and the Chelsea club in
southwest London. Other teams were also expected to participate,
but Blair's office did not have a complete list.
	   England is seeking to host the 2006 soccer World Cup. Organizers
are pushing their bid by marketing this country's Premier League as
the most cosmopolitan competition in the world, embracing more
World Cup stars than any other. France hosted the tournament this
summer.
	   A number of heroes from the victorious French World Cup team
currently play in Britain. Emmanuel Petit and Patrick Vieira play
for Arsenal, and the Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger is also a
Frenchman. And French World Cup star Marcel Desailly and his World
Cup teammate Frank LeBoeuf play for Chelsea.

Slobodan Milosevic sacks security chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from some opposition leaders, no
additional purges reported &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic sacked his secret service chief Tuesday following reports
that the official opposed his hardline policies, including the
Kosovo crackdown.
	   Jovica Stanisic was replaced by police Gen. Radomir Markovic,
according to a statement by the Serbian government, controlled by
Milosevic. Stanisic had also been a security adviser and key aide
to Milosevic.
	   Independent B-92 radio said a session of Milosevic's ruling
Socialist Party was underway and may result in more purges of
reported pro-reformists within party ranks.
	   But a statement issued after the Socialists' session made no
mention of additional purges. Instead it praised Milosevic's
policies over Serbia's southern province of Kosovo, where majority
ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence.
	   Independent media have recently reported that Stanisic was
against excessive use of force against ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo. He reportedly also led a faction within the government
which objected to Milosevic's cooperation with ultranationalists
led by deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj.
	   During Milosevic's decade-long rule, Stanisic played a major
role in helping him maintain his grip on power.
	   His ouster indicated that the hardliners were winning over the
reformists within the government. Milosevic has used a threat of
NATO attacks against military targets in Yugoslavia to crackdown on
his opponents at home.
	   Opposition leader Zoran Djindjic said Stanisic's ouster was

Iraq rejects contention that it used loaded VX on missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq rejected as a fabrication Tuesday the
contention by U.N. and chemical weapons experts that it had loaded
the deadly nerve agent VX into missile warheads.
	   Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, an adviser to President Saddam Hussein,
said U.N. inspectors were using the issue to prolong the U.N. trade
sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990.
	   The statements ``are a part of a dubious fabrication,'' the
statement read on state-run television said.
	   A second round of tests on the missile warheads did not provide
further conclusive evidence that Iraq loaded VX on the missiles,
although there were signs that Iraq had cleaned the pieces between
the initial U.S. tests in April and the tests in June and July.
	   Despite the lack of additional proof, U.N. and chemical weapons
experts from seven countries said they were still satisfied with
the initial tests in April that the Iraqis had used the VX for
warheads.
	   Saadi, the mastermind of Iraq's chemical weapons program,
reiterated earlier Iraqi claims that Baghdad never succeeded in
stabilizing the VX gas and turning it into a weapon.
	   Saadi said the conclusion of U.N. experts contradicts scientific
fact and is ``full of disgraceful scientific fallacies.''
	   Saadi said Iraq never tampered with the warheads. Any attempt
would have been observed by U.N. monitors in Baghdad who keep the
warhead fragments under camera surveillance, he said.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
weapons of mass destruction _ and the missiles to deliver them _
before the 15-member Security Council will lift the sanctions.

Arena to rebuild United States with MLS youngsters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bruce Arena took less than 10 minutes of being
announced as the new American national team head coach to let it be
known things were going to change _ immediately.
	   Without being critical of his predecessor, Steve Sampson, Arena
said Tuesday that the United States needs to rebuild with young
players from Major League Soccer.
	   ``We need a new base. All players are eligible, but we need to
build with the MLS,'' Arena said. ``MLS has a great young pool of
talent. I want to use what's left of 1998 and 1999 to develop that
pool, blend the young players with the experienced veterans so by
the year 2000 we're ready to qualify in CONCACAF.''
	   Expect to see the changes as early as Wednesday, when Arena will
announce his roster for an Aug. 6 friendly against Australia in San
Jose, California.
	   ``I suspect about half will never have played for their
country,'' Arena said.
	   Among those could be forwards Ben Olsen of D.C. United and Josh
Wolff of Chicago, Los Angeles midfielder Clint Mathis and
MetroStars defender Mark Petke, four rookies who earned wide praise
this past season in MLS.
	   Arena's comments, and those of U.S. federation secretary general
Hank Steinbrecher, were clear that the U.S. national team program
would rely heavily on its 3-year-old league to build the foundation
and furnish the interior of the 2002 World Cup squad.
	   ``This emphasizes indelibly that we believe in our league; we
believe in the strength of our league; we believe in the American
player and we believe in our American coach,'' Steinbrecher said.
	   Arena, who said his comments should not be interpreted as
excluding players from Europe _ particularly singling out
goalkeepers Kasey Keller with Leicester and Brad Friedel with
Liverpool for praise, takes over as U.S. national team coach two
days after failing in his bid to win a third straight MLS title.
	   Chicago's 2-0 victory over the United was the only stain on
Arena's tenure with Washington. He still has two games to coach
with D.C., the Interamerican Cup against Brazil's Vasco da Gama on
Nov. 14 and Dec. 5.
	   Arena takes over for Steve Sampson, an assistant to Bora
Milutinovic during the 1994 World Cup. When Milutinovic left in the
spring of 1995, Sampson was given the title of interim coach while
U.S. federation officials tried to lure Carlos Alberto Parreira of
Brazil and Carlos Queiroz of Portugal.
	   When those attempts failed, and the United States finished
fourth at the 1995 Copa America, Sampson was given the job. But
despite being the only coach of the U.S. national team with a
winning record, Sampson's team fell apart at the World Cup with
three straight losses, a last place finish and he resigned.
	   Speculation of Arena's appointment has been rife since Sampson's
resignation. He won five U.S. college titles before taking over as
the 1996 Olympic coach and D.C. United, where he clearly was the
most successful coach in the league.

Spanish judge reaffirms arrest warrant against Pinochet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish judge who instigated the
detention in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, on
Tuesday rejected appeals against his warrant made from within his
own Madrid court.
	   Pinochet was detained in a London clinic on Oct. 16 on the basis
of an international arrest warrant issued by Judge Baltasar Garzon
as a first step towards extraditing the ailing general to Spain to
stand trial for genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   Last week Eduardo Fungarino, chief prosecutor of the National
Court to which Garzon is also attached, appealed against Garzon's
warrant and all other orders issued in relation to the extradition
attempt.
	   Garzon's formal refusal to act on appeals effectively kicked
them up to a higher authority within the National Court to be
decided at a later date. Spain's National Court deals with cases
deemed of national importance such as terrorism, corruption or
genocide.
	   Tuesday's events did not affect the course of the Pinochet case
but they did reaffirm Garzon's commitment to see it through, just
days before a dozen National Court magistrates were to decide
whether he has any right to delve into Chilean crimes at all.
	   The magistrates were due to meet Thursday to deliberate on an
earlier appeal filed by Fungarino that challenges the more
fundamental legal issue of whether Spanish judges have any business
investigating crimes against humanity, such as genocide, that took
place outside of Spain.
	   Over the last two years a National Court investigation has been
gathering evidence into the murder, torture and disappearance of
thousands of Chileans and some foreigners during Pinochet's
1973-1990 regime.
	   A decision is expected Friday.
	   If the magistrates rules against Spanish jurisdiction for
Chilean crimes, then the extradition request will be difficult to
sustain.
	   Meanwhile, after nearly two days of complex legal argument
London's High Court was expected to rule Wednesday on Pinochet's
application for immediate release.
	   A ruling in favor of Pinochet would render academic the National
Court's deliberations at the end of the week.

Vatican wants special status for Jerusalem holy places
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - The Vatican wants Israel and the Palestinians
to create special statutes ensuring access to Jerusalem's holiest
sites when the two parties begin negotiations of the city's future,
it's foreign minister said Tuesday.
	   Monsignor Jean Louis Tauran said that the vatican is not asking
for a seat at the negotiating table with Israel and the
Palestinians and is not interested in taking a stand on the claims
of the city by the two sides.
	   ``But...we ask that the uniqueness and the sacredness of the
most holy places of Jerusalem be internationally guaranteed.''
	   Tauran spoke at a press conference at the end of a two-day
conference on Jerusalem attended by some 40 Catholic clergymen from
around the world.
	   Tauran said the Holy See wants the rights of believers taken
into consideration.
	   According to a communique published at the end of the
conference, the special statutes would ensure Muslims, Jews and
Christians ``true freedom of conscience and religion, including
full access to the Holy Places, and their right to carry out their
own religious, educational and social activities.''
	   In negotiations on a permanent peace agreement, Israel and the
Palestinians will try to tackle the most difficult issues,
including the future of Jerusalem.
	   Palestinians want traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, where most
of the Holy sites are located, as the capital of their would-be
state. But Israel, which captured the Arab sector in the 1967
Middle East war, has maintained it will not accept a divided
capital.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was to meet Tauran
Wednesday to discuss Israel's position regarding Vatican concerns.

Arafat's Fatah group enforces strike in West Bank towns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout with details from military tribunal; comment
from police commander; Arafat returning Wednesday &QL; 
 &UR; By MOHAMMED DARAGMEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ In a show of force, Yasser Arafat's
Fatah faction shut down several West Bank towns Tuesday to push for
the trial and execution of Palestinian intelligence agents who
killed a young Fatah activist in a clash this week.
	   In the West Bank town of Nablus, hundreds of Fatah activists
filled the streets and burned tires. Several marchers fired their
weapons in the air.
	   Fatah also enforced strikes in the towns of Bethlehem, Tulkarem
and in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. Shops were shuttered and
students were told to leave their schools.
	   The dispute began Sunday when members of the Palestinian
military intelligence raided the Fatah headquarters in the town of
Ramallah and seized weapons and files. A Fatah activist,
16-year-old Wassim Tarifi, was shot and killed by intelligence
agents during subsequent rock-throwing protests.
	   Fatah leaders want Tarifi's killers to be tried and executed.
They also seek the ouster of the head of military intelligence,
Moussa Arafat, a distant relative of the Palestinian leader.
	   At a press conference in Ramallah, Arafat said he would not
resign unless asked to by the Palestinian leader. He said he
ordered his men into the Fatah office not in search for weapons but
to find several fugitives.
	   He denied members of his force fired the bullet which killed
Tarifi and blamed the death on shots fired from the crowd.
	   ``There were no orders given to members of the military
intelligence to open fire at the protesters,'' he said. Several men
from his force were being detained and questioned in the shooting.
	   Despite following their commander's orders, the four officers
who entered the Fatah building were court marshaled in Jericho
Tuesday on charges of violating the sanctity of the Fatah office
and harming national unity. The face a maximum penalty of three
years in jail and sentencing was scheduled for Wednesday.
	   Palestinian leader Arafat is abroad and will return later
Wednesday. He needs Fatah's support to shape public opinion and is
expected to move quickly to quell the growing rebellion of his
loyalists.
	   A senior Arafat aide, Tayeb Abdel Rahim, said that Arafat has
already ordered the establishment of a special military tribunal
that would investigate the case and try the suspected shooters.
However, no one has been arrested yet in Tarifi's death.
	   In a similar case in August, Arafat complied with Fatah demands
and ordered the execution of two Palestinian policemen who had
killed two of the group's activists in a personal feud.

Eight weeks after crash, bulk of Flight 111 wreckage now recovered
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of pieces of Swissair
Flight 111, representing 60 percent of the plane, have now been
retrieved from the ocean floor, but an explanation for the Sept. 2
crash remains far off, investigators said Tuesday.
	   Benoit Bouchard, chairman of Canada's Transportation Safety
Board, predicted it would take longer than the normal 12 months to
complete a final report on the crash off the Nova Scotia coast that
killed all 229 people aboard the New York-to-Geneva flight.
	   ``It's a very complicated and complex investigation,'' Bouchard
said. ``But I remain optimistic that we will identify any safety
deficiencies that may exist.''
	   As of two weeks ago, only 10 percent of the wrecked MD-11 jet
had been recovered. Then a barge equipped with an underwater crane
was brought in to scoop up large pieces of the plane.
	   Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said the operation was
a success, retrieving all three of the engines, parts of the
fuselage and cockpit, as well as electronic circuit boards and
bundles of wiring that will be examined for possible clues into the
source of smoke that the pilots detected 16 minutes before the
crash.
	   Some debris from the cockpit area shows signs of extreme heat,
but investigators have yet to establish any details about the cause
or extent of a possible fire on board.
	   ``We're really just now at the stage where we have quite a bit
of aircraft to examine,'' Gerden said.
	   He said investigators still don't know at what angle the plane
hit the water and hope that digital controls in the engines may
give an indication of the plane's speed at impact.
	   The impact was so severe that all the victims' bodies were badly
fragmented, complicating the identification process.
	   Dr. John Butt, Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, joined
investigators at a news briefing in Halifax on Tuesday to report
that remains of 134 people have now been identified, mostly through
matching with DNA samples provided by relatives.
	   He said 228 distinct DNA patterns have now been detected from
the remains, indicating remains from all but one of the people on
board has been found.
	   Gerden said the heavy-lifting barge, the Sea Sorceress, has
completed its work, and will be replaced this week by a boat
normally used to drag up scallops. Its task will be to retrieve the
smaller debris that remains on the ocean floor, about 180 feet (55
meters) below the surface.
	   Though the final report is probably more than a year away,
Bouchard said the safety board would issue provisional
recommendations at any point when investigators felt they had
detected a safety hazard,
	   ``We will do everything we can to reduce risks associated with
flying,'' he said.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO decided Tuesday to keep up the
threat of air strikes against Serb forces for an unspecified but
``limit'' period, despite recognizing a substantial withdrawal of
troops and police from Kosovo.
	   A meeting of ambassadors from the 16-allied nations agreed to
indefinitely extend the ``activation order'' which is keeping over
400 allied warplanes on alert for possible raids against the Serbs.
	   ``We have instructed our military to remain prepared ... and
maintain forces,'' said NATO Secretary General Javier Solana.

	   He said the decision would maintain pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic as it appeared his troops were
complying with the alliance's demand that reinforcements sent to
Kosovo during the eight-month crisis be withdrawn by a deadline of
8 p.m. (1900 GMT) Tuesday.
	   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' Solana told a news
conference after the 2 1/2 meeting.
	   Solana told a news conference that reports from observers on the
ground and reconnaissance flights by unarmed NATO planes showed
most Yugoslav army and special police units had withdrawn from
Kosovo or been returned to barracks.

Eight weeks after crash, bulk of Flight 111 wreckage now recovered
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to fix slug &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of pieces of Swissair
Flight 111, representing 60 percent of the plane, have now been
retrieved from the ocean floor, but an explanation for the Sept. 2
crash remains far off, investigators said Tuesday.
	   Benoit Bouchard, chairman of Canada's Transportation Safety
Board, predicted it would take longer than the normal 12 months to
complete a final report on the crash off the Nova Scotia coast that
killed all 229 people aboard the New York-to-Geneva flight.
	   ``It's a very complicated and complex investigation,'' Bouchard
said. ``But I remain optimistic that we will identify any safety
deficiencies that may exist.''
	   As of two weeks ago, only 10 percent of the wrecked MD-11 jet
had been recovered. Then a barge equipped with an underwater crane
was brought in to scoop up large pieces of the plane.
	   Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said the operation was
a success, retrieving all three of the engines, parts of the
fuselage and cockpit, as well as electronic circuit boards and
bundles of wiring that will be examined for possible clues into the
source of smoke that the pilots detected 16 minutes before the
crash.
	   Some debris from the cockpit area shows signs of extreme heat,
but investigators have yet to establish any details about the cause
or extent of a possible fire on board.
	   ``We're really just now at the stage where we have quite a bit
of aircraft to examine,'' Gerden said.
	   He said investigators still don't know at what angle the plane
hit the water and hope that digital controls in the engines may
give an indication of the plane's speed at impact.
	   The impact was so severe that all the victims' bodies were badly
fragmented, complicating the identification process.
	   Dr. John Butt, Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, joined
investigators at a news briefing in Halifax on Tuesday to report
that remains of 134 people have now been identified, mostly through
matching with DNA samples provided by relatives.
	   He said 228 distinct DNA patterns have now been detected from
the remains, indicating remains from all but one of the people on
board has been found.
	   Gerden said the heavy-lifting barge, the Sea Sorceress, has
completed its work, and will be replaced this week by a boat
normally used to drag up scallops. Its task will be to retrieve the
smaller debris that remains on the ocean floor, about 180 feet (55
meters) below the surface.
	   Though the final report is probably more than a year away,
Bouchard said the safety board would issue provisional
recommendations at any point when investigators felt they had
detected a safety hazard,
	   ``We will do everything we can to reduce risks associated with
flying,'' he said.

Jordanian soldiers buried near Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Four Jordanian soldiers who fell during the
1967 Mideast war were finally given a full military burial Tuesday,
in Israel.
	   The soldiers died during intense battles in Nabi Samuel, an town
north of Jerusalem whose view of the contested city made it
critical strategically during the war in which Israel captured
Jerusalem from the Jordanians.
	   The soldiers' remains were discovered three years ago, during an
archaelogical dig in the area known as Nabi Samuel. Family members
said that they agreed to requests from Jordanian officials to bury
the soldiers where they had been found because it is an honor to be
buried near Jerusalem, Israel TV reported.
	   Tuesday Jordanian soldiers dressed in khaki uniforms and
red-checkered kaffiyahs draped wooden coffins with Jordanian flags
and lowered the caskets into the ground as military trumpets
blasted.
	   Eldad Evitar, a former commander who led Israeli troops in the
area during the war, praised the courage of his Jordanian
counterparts.
	   ``In war, we are each other's enemies. In peace, we are friends
and colleagues,'' Evitar told Israel TV.
	   The Jordanian ambassador to Israel and several Jordanian
lawmakers also attended the funeral in what was once enemy
territory. In 1994, Jordan signed a peace treaty that ended 46
years of hostile relations between the countries.

BRUSSELS: Solana said.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   He said the decision would maintain pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic while it appeared his troops were
complying with the alliance's demand that reinforcements sent to
Kosovo during the eight-month crisis be withdrawn. NATO had set a
deadline of 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) Tuesday.
	   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' Solana said at a
news conference after the 2 1/2 meeting.
	   Solana said reports from observers on the ground and
reconnaissance flights by unarmed NATO planes showed most Yugoslav
army and special police units had withdrawn from Kosovo or been
returned to barracks.

Italy's Senate gives final go-ahead to new, far left-led
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Senate gave its approval Tuesday to the new
government of Massimo D'Alema, giving Parliament's final clearance
to Italy's first administration to be led by former Communists.
	   D'Alema's coalition won Tuesday's Senate vote of confidence by
188-116 with one abstention. The margin was about as comfortable as
last week's vote in the Chamber of Deputies, where it was 333-281
with three abstentions.
	   ``Now, we must get to work,'' said D'Alema, who went to
Parliament to watch Tuesday's vote.
	   D'Alema's coalition includes ex-Christian Democrats from the
previous, center-left coalition of Romano Prodi but the main force
comes from former communists like himself. There also are the first
communist Cabinet ministers since 1947.
	   As Italy's new premier, D'Alema has pledged to stick to the
stringent economic policies of his predecessor. The penny-pinching
contributed to the fall of Prodi's coalition but ensured that Italy
qualifiied for next year's debut of Europe's single currency, the
euro.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old coalition lost a vote of confidence by a
single ballot on Oct. 9 after a communist faction withdrew its
support.
	   D'Alema's becomes Italy's 56th government since World War II.

NATO maintains airstrike threat, no new deadline

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO decided Tuesday to keep up the
threat of air strikes against Serb forces for an unspecified
period, despite recognizing a substantial withdrawal of troops and
police from Kosovo.
	   A meeting of ambassadors from the 16-allied nations agreed to
indefinitely extend the ``activation order'' which is keeping over
400 allied warplanes on alert for possible raids against the Serbs.
	   ``We have requested our military authorities to remain prepared
to carry out these air operations ... and to maintain forces at
appropriate readiness levels,'' said NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana.
	   But the alliance did not set a new deadline for the airstrikes,
after the previous deadline of 1900 GMT expired.
	   Solana said the decision would maintain pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic at a time when his troops were moving
to comply with the alliance's demand that reinforcements sent to
Kosovo during the eight-month crisis be withdrawn.
	   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' Solana told a news
conference after the 2 1/2 meeting.
	   Solana told a news conference that reports from observers on the
ground and reconnaissance flights by unarmed NATO planes showed
most Yugoslav army and special police units had withdrawn from
Kosovo or been returned to barracks.
	   ``The security forces are returning to the level they were at
before the present crisis began,'' he said.
	   Solana said the NATO ambassadors would keep the situation under
constant review. ``If we see evidence of substantial non compliance
in the future ... we will be ready to use force,'' he said.
	   Convoys of tanks and trucks carrying Yugoslav troops and police
pulled out of several parts of Kosovo Tuesday, indicating Milosevic
had ordered compliance with demands he reduce Serb forces in Kosovo
to levels before the conflict with ethnic Albanian separatists
flared February.
	   Solana said 4,000 members of the special police had left Kosovo
in the past 24 hours. He said police and military units normally

	   In Washington, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said

Miss Lebanon won't shake hands with Israel's beauty queen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Miss Israel should not expect open arms.
	   Citing a state of war with Israel, Lebanon's new beauty queen
declared Tuesday that she would not shake hands with her Israeli
counterpart at the Miss World and Miss Universe contests.
	   ``We all know that Lebanon is in conflict with Israel which is
occupying an important region in our country. If I see her, I will
not shake hands with her and will try to keep a distance from her
so that I won't have to shake hands with her,'' said Clemence
Ashkar.
	   Ashkar, an 18-year-old sociology student, was chosen Friday as
Miss Lebanon from 23 contestants during a four-hour ceremony.
	   Lebanon, which is technically at war with Israel, forbids any
dealing or contacts with the Jewish state.
	   Since 1985, Israel has occupied a border enclave in southern
Lebanon as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks.

Morocco backs new Middle East peace accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ The Moroccan government on Tuesday voiced
support for the new Middle East peace accord, describing the deal
reached in Washington last week as ``the last chance.''
	   ``Morocco supports the work of the Palestinian Authority,''
government spokesman Khalid Alioua told reporters. ``This accord is
the last chance.''
	   It was the first reaction by the Moroccan government to the
accord which calls for further Israeli withdrawals from the West
Bank and a Palestinian crackdown on militants to prevent attacks
against Israelis.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was in Morocco on Sunday as
part of a regional tour to drum up support for the accord.
	   Many in the Arab world have criticized the pact as geared too
much toward Israel's security demands and too little toward
Palestinian interests.

Serb forces redeploy in Kosovo as NATO deadline passes

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces drew back Tuesday
from former Kosovo battlefronts, holding off the threat of NATO
airstrikes. The Alliance decided to maintain the threat
indefinitely to press for a political solution to the crisis.
	   ``We have instructed our military to remain prepared ... and
maintain forces,'' NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said in
Brussels, Belgium, as the 1900 GMT deadline passed.
	   Private radio station B-92 quoted Serb sources as saying the
withdrawal was complete and that government forces in Kosovo were
back to the level before Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched his crackdown against ethnic Albanian militants on Feb.
28.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said reports
from the field indicated Milosevic was in ``substantial
compliance'' with terms of the Kosovo peace agreement.
	   ``Well over 90 percent of the security force reinforcements''
have been withdrawn, major road blocks have been dismantled and
heavy weapons have been returned to garrison, Lockhart said. ``As
we see this substantial compliance, we also need to make sure that
coming into compliance isn't the only issue. We need to send the
message that he needs to stay in compliance.''
	   Hundreds of people died and nearly 300,000 have been driven from
their homes in fighting since Milosevic sent in troops to battle
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and
most want independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The 16-nation NATO alliance had threatened to launch airstrikes
unless Milosevic halted his crackdown and cuts his forces to levels
in place before the conflict began.
	   In Malisevo, a former rebel stronghold 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of the provincial capital, Pristina, hundreds of ethnic
Albanians filled the streets Tuesday, visiting homes and shops they
abandoned when Serb forces overran the town in July.
	   The crowds vanished after bursts of automatic gunfire rang out
when a small convoy of armored police vehicles rolled into town.
Serb police said the shots came from somewhere in the village and
they did not return fire.
	   About two kilometers (a mile) north of town, uniformed
guerrillas inspected bunkers vacated by Serb police and found a
grenade tied to a tree, with a trip wire set as a booby trap.
	   Such threats prevent most refugees in Kosovo from returning
home. But many have come out of the wilderness because of the
approaching winter to stay with friends and relatives in safe
towns, said U.N. refugee official Kris Janowski. He said about
10,000 are still in the woods.
	   Osman Mazreku, a villager in Malisevo, said he fled to a nearby
town nearly three months ago with his wife, mother and three
children. His elderly father stayed behind, was arrested by police
and has not been seen since, Mazreku said.
	   ``He said 'I'm old and they won't do anything to me,''' Mazreku
said. ``I was afraid something like this would happen.''
	   The top floor of the family's two-story house had been gutted by
flames. Clothing, valuables and garbage were strewn across the
ground floor.
	   ``I'm sorry to see my house in this condition, but I'm happy to
be alive,'' he said. ``I hope they'll let me live here.''
	   The ability of refugees to return to their homes before the
advent of winter is critical to the success of international
efforts to bring peace to the troubled province.
	   Despite the apparent success in persuading Milosevic to withdraw
his forces, Western powers insisted that NATO must keep up its
guard to prevent renewed fighting and encourage talks between
Milosevic and ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Western powers want Milosevic to grant substantial autonomy to
Kosovo, which he abolished in 1989. But they oppose independence as
demanded by ethnic Albanians, fearing that would lead to similar
demands in other Balkan countries with large ethnic Albanian
communities.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, speaking in a BBC
interview, warned NATO should not drop its guard despite ``serious
progress'' by Milosevic. ``He still has some way to go and it may
well be wise for us to keep that threat hanging over him,'' Cook
said.
	   In Geneva, a spokesman for the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army, Bardhyl Mahmuti, called the Yugoslav troop movements nothing
more than an ``illusion.'' Ethnic Albanians maintain the government
troops are withdrawing only temporarily and want NATO to strike.
	   Evidence of the Serb withdrawal included the abandoned Komorane
checkpoint outside Pristina and signs of more movement among
villagers.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO decided Tuesday to keep up the
threat of air strikes against Serb forces for an unspecified
period, despite recognizing a substantial withdrawal of troops and
police from Kosovo.
	   A meeting of ambassadors from the 16-allied nations agreed to
indefinitely extend the ``activation order,'' which is keeping more
than 400 allied warplanes on alert for possible raids against the
Serbs.
	   ``We have requested our military authorities to remain prepared
to carry out these air operations ... and to maintain forces at
appropriate readiness levels,'' said NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana.
	   But the alliance did not set a new deadline for the airstrikes
after the previous deadline of 1900 GMT expired.
	   Solana said the decision would maintain pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic at a time when his troops were moving
to comply with the alliance's demand that reinforcements sent to
Kosovo during the eight-month crisis be withdrawn.
	   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' Solana said at a
news conference after the 2 1/2 meeting.
	   Hundreds of people have died and nearly 300,000 have been driven
from their homes in fighting since Milosevic sent in troops to
battle ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and
most want independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The NATO alliance had threatened to launch airstrikes unless
Milosevic halted his crackdown and cut his forces to levels in
place before the conflict began.
	   Solana said reports from observers on the ground and
reconnaissance flights by unarmed NATO planes showed most Yugoslav
army and special police units had withdrawn from Kosovo or returned
to barracks.
	   ``The security forces are returning to the level they were at
before the present crisis began,'' he said.
	   Solana said NATO ambassadors would keep the situation under
constant review. ``If we see evidence of substantial noncompliance
in the future ... we will be ready to use force,'' he said.
	   Convoys of tanks and trucks carrying Yugoslav troops and police
pulled out of several parts of Kosovo Tuesday, indicating Milosevic
had ordered compliance with demands he reduce Serb forces in Kosovo
to levels before the conflict with ethnic Albanian separatists
flared February.
	   Solana said 4,000 members of the special police had left Kosovo
in the past 24 hours. He said police and military units normally
based in Kosovo were moving back to garrisons, check points have
been dismantled.
	   In Washington, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said
Milosevic had withdrawn ``well over 90 percent of the security
force reinforcements.''
	   ``Thanks to NATO pressure and determination, very substantial
steps have been taken toward compliance,'' Lockhart added.

ANC fires back at leaked Truth Commission findings

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The ruling African National
Congress fired back Tuesday at a leaked Truth and Reconciliation
Commission finding that it violated human rights during the
anti-apartheid struggle.
	   ANC Secretary-General Kgalema Motlanthe said the commission's
preliminary
	   findings, leaked to the media Monday, were ``baseless'' and
contained ``glaring inaccuracies.''
	   Preliminary findings of the commission exploring apartheid-era
atrocities
	   says the ANC planted mines in rural areas, executed enemy agents
and blurred
	   the line between military and civilian targets.
	   Motlanthe did not specify what items were unsupported or
inconsistent. But the ANC, in an earlier written response to the
Truth Commission's findings which was leaked to the media on
Tuesday, said it was proud of its anti-apartheid struggle. The ANC
also accused the Truth Commision of criminalizing the struggle by
blaming it for gross human rights abuses, the South African Press
Association reported.
	   ``Whatever the efforts to besmirch our struggle by denouncing it
as gross violation of human rights, the ANC ... and the millions of
people who were part of this struggle will always be proud of what
they did to ensure that, in the process of the destruction of a
vile system, they do not themselves resort to vile methods,'' the
ANC said. SAPA said it had obtained a copy of the ANC's response.
	   The Truth Commission's 3,500-page report that culminates more
than two years of nationwide hearings is to be handed to President
Nelson Mandela on Thursday, a milestone for South Africa's
transformation from white minority rule to democracy.
	   The commission was charged with promoting reconciliation by
laying bare apartheid's horrors. But its report has caused friction
even before its release.
	   Motlanthe said in a statement that the commission rebuffed the
ANC's attempts to meet to respond to the preliminary findings. The
group gave the written response instead, Motlanthe said.
	   The report will doubtless lay the overwhelming blame for
apartheid atrocities from 1960 to 1994 on white governments and
their security forces.
	   But, in a spirit of reconciliation long preached by Mandela, the
ANC's response warns the Truth Commission not to convey a message
that Afrikaners _ the descendants of Dutch settlers who ruled
during apartheid _ were individually and intrinsically bad.
	   Similarly, it warned against the Truth Commission report
suggesting that the war South African soldiers waged against the
liberation movement constituted a gross violation of human rights,
SAPA said.
	   Lawyers for former President F.W. de Klerk, meanwhile, are
expected to ask a court Wednesday to prevent the report from
implicating him in apartheid crimes.

Council concerned at intensified rebel activity in Sierra Leone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council expressed
renewed concern Tuesday at intensified rebel activity in Sierra
Leone and reiterated calls for a political settlement and national
reconciliation.
	   The council discussed a report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan who last week condemned ``acts of barbarism'' by the rebels
and urged them to lay down their arms and surrender. Annan said
human rights abuses committed by the rebels have created a
``humanitarian emergency'' in the West African nation.
	   The Security Council, after a briefing on the latest
developments in Sierra Leone, expressed concern at atrocities
against civilians, the continuing humanitarian and refugee crisis,
and increased tension on Sierra Leone's border with Liberia.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, the council's president,
said members welcomed the resumption of political dialogue between
the leaders of Sierra Leone and Liberia and urged them to continue
talks at this week's summit of the Economic Community of West
African States in Abuja, Nigeria.
	   ``Council members underlined that the only lasting solution to
the cycle of violence in Sierra Leone was a political one, based on
national reconciliation, and they encouraged all efforts in that
direction, including on the part of the government of Sierra Leone
itself,'' Greenstock said.
	   Sierra Leone, one of the world's poorest countries, has been
plagued by civil war since the early 1990s.
	   A rebel junta which seized power from the democratically elected
government in May 1997 was driven from office by a Nigerian-led
peacekeeping force. Although the elected president's return to
power early this year was hailed as a victory for democracy in West
Africa, the bloodshed has not ended.
	   U.N. humanitarian experts estimate that 250,000 people have been
displaced since the intervention of the Nigerian-led peacekeeping
force in February, an increase of about 70,000 since August. And
Annan said there are fears a considerable number of displaced
people remain uncounted.

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav government scrambled
Tuesday to pull back Serb forces in Kosovo, but NATO reserved the
right to carry out airstrikes at any time to protect ethnic
Albanians.
	   The Clinton administration said the Serbs were in ``substantial
compliance'' with the Kosovo peace accord. And the NATO
secretary-general said it appeared Serb forces were redeploying in
the embattled province, as demanded by Western governments.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Private radio station B-92 quoted Serb sources
as saying the Serb withdrawal was complete and that government
forces in Kosovo were back to the level before Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic launched his crackdown against ethnic Albanian
militants on Feb. 28.

	   ``Well over 90 percent of the security force reinforcements''

heavy weapons have been returned to garrison, Lockhart said. ``As
we see this substantial compliance, we also need to make sure that
coming into compliance isn't the only issue. We need to send the

	   In Brussels, Belgium, a meeting of ambassadors from the 16 NATO

keeping over 400 allied warplanes on alert for possible raids
against the Serbs.
	   ``We have instructed our military to remain prepared ... and

	   He said the decision would maintain pressure on Milosevic as it
appeared his troops were complying with the alliance's demand for

	   The NATO alliance threatened to launch airstrikes unless
Milosevic halted his crackdown and cut his forces to levels in

	   In Belgrade, the special U.S. mediator for Kosovo, Christopher
Hill, said reports from the field indicated ``substantial
movement,'' but he stopped short of declaring the withdrawal
complete.
	   ``There is an effort to reconfigure the security forces in a way
that we truly hope will reduce the violence substantially,'' Hill
said. ``We also hope this ... moving around of forces, will help
resolve the issue of the displaced ... people who are afraid to
come back to their villages.''
	   In Geneva, a spokesman for the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army, Bardhyl Mahmuti, called the Yugoslav troop movements nothing
more than an ``illusion.'' Ethnic Albanians maintain the government
troops are withdrawing only temporarily and want NATO to strike.
	   Evidence of the Serb withdrawal included the abandoned Komorane

	   Such threats prevent most refugees in Kosovo from returning

town nearly three months ago with his wife, mother and three
children. His elderly father stayed behind, was arrested by police
and has not been seen since, Mazreku said.
	   ``He said 'I'm old and they won't do anything to me,''' Mazreku
said. ``I was afraid something like this would happen.''
	   The top floor of the family's two-story house had been gutted by
flames. Clothing, valuables and garbage were strewn across the
ground floor.
	   ``I'm sorry to see my house in this condition, but I'm happy to
be alive,'' he said. ``I hope they'll let me live here.''

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Vladimir Meciar's out-going Slovak
government dismissed the director of Slovakia's intelligence
service Tuesday, at its final session.
	   The Slovak government decided late Tuesday to remove Ivan Lexa
from his post, Czech CTK news agency reported. Rudolf Ziak has been
appointed to the post. No reasons were given for the move.
	   Lexa, a close Meciar ally, is suspected of involvement in the
August 1995 kidnapping of the son of former Slovak President Michal
Kovac, Meciar's archrival.
	   It is likely that Lexa will become a deputy in the new
opposition-led Slovak parliament, when it takes over Thursday.
	   Under Slovak law, deputies cannot be tried in court, and there
are speculations another member of Meciar's party will give up his
parliamentary seat for Lexa to ensure his protection.
	   Lexa was appointed director of the intelligence services last
year, at the same time it was removed from monitoring by the
opposition.
	   According to CTK, some 150 additional intelligence workers are
leaving the service before the government changes hands.
	   Meciar was voted out of power in Slovak elections last Sept.

Slobodan Milosevic sacks security chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic fired his secret service chief on Tuesday following
reports the official opposed his hard-line policies, including the
crackdown in Kosovo.
	   Jovica Stanisic was replaced by police Gen. Radomir Markovic,
according to a statement by the Serbian government, which Milosevic
controls. Stanisic had also served as a security adviser and chief
aide to Milosevic.
	   His removal indicated that hard-liners were gaining ground
against reformists within the Yugoslav government. Milosevic has
used a threat of NATO attacks against military targets in
Yugoslavia to clamp down on his opponents at home. Reports of
purges suggest he is moving against critics within his inner
circle.
	   Independent media have reported that Stanisic opposed the
excessive use of force against ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence in Kosovo, a province of Serbia _ the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   He reportedly also headed a government faction that objected to
Milosevic's cooperation with ultranationalists led by deputy
Premier Vojislav Seselj.
	   Opposition leader Zoran Djindjic called Stanisic's ouster
``worrying.''
	   Independent B-92 radio said a session of Milosevic's ruling
Socialist Party was under way and might result in purges of other
party members who are reported to favor more moderate policies. But
a statement issued after the session made no mention of additional
purges.
	   During Milosevic's decade-long rule, Stanisic was his key aide.
He is also believed to have played a major part in the arming of
Bosnian and Croatian Serbs, whose armed rebellions led to the
breakup of the former Yugoslav federation.
	   In 1995, Stanisic helped win the release of hundreds of U.N.
peacekeepers taken hostage by Bosnian Serbs. The Serbs had seized
the peacekeepers in an effort to stave off NATO attacks on Serb
positions.
	   Stanisic reportedly favored recognizing an opposition victory in
elections in November 1996. Annulment of the victory led to three
months of street protests that shook Milosevic's rule.
	   Stanisic reportedly also spoke out against the recent crackdown
on newspapers, radio station and other media outlets in Serbia.

NATO maintains airstrike threat, no new deadline

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on force levels in Kosovo; Appeal to
Kosovo Albanians to also comply with U.N. resolution; CORRECTS lead

 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies decided Tuesday to keep
up the threat of air strikes against Serb forces for an unspecified
period, despite recognizing a substantial withdrawal of troops and
police from Kosovo.
	   A meeting of ambassadors from the 16-allied nations agreed to
indefinitely extend the ``activation order'' which is keeping over
400 allied warplanes on alert for possible raids against the Serbs.
	   ``We have requested our military authorities to remain prepared
to carry out these air operations ... and to maintain forces at
appropriate readiness levels,'' said NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana.
	   But the alliance did not set a new deadline for airstrikes,
after the previous deadline of 1900 GMT expired.
	   Solana said the decision would maintain pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic at a time when his troops were moving
to comply with the alliance's demand that reinforcements sent to
Kosovo during the eight-month crisis be withdrawn.
	   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' Solana told a news
conference after the 2 1/2 hour meeting.
	   He said reports from observers on the ground and reconnaissance
flights by unarmed NATO planes showed most Yugoslav army and
special police units had withdrawn from Kosovo or been returned to
their barracks in the province.
	   ``The security forces are returning to the level they were at
before the present crisis began,'' he said, adding some 10,000 army
troops and special police forces remained in Kosovo.
	   The allies issued a statement calling on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo to comply with U.N. resolutions and ``maintain the ceasefire
they have declared.''
	   Solana said the NATO ambassadors would keep the situation under
constant review. ``If we see evidence of substantial non compliance
in the future ... we will be ready to use force,'' he said.
	   However, under Tuesday's decision NATO's top military commander
in Europe, U.S. General Wesley Clark, will need authorization from
the NATO governments before he can go ahead with air strikes.
	   Convoys of tanks and trucks carrying Yugoslav troops and police
pulled out of several parts of Kosovo Tuesday, indicating Milosevic
had ordered compliance with demands he reduce Serb forces in Kosovo
to levels before the conflict with ethnic Albanian separatists
flared February.
	   Solana said 4,000 members of the special police had left Kosovo
in the past 24 hours. He said police and military units normally
based in Kosovo were moving back to garrisons, check points have
been dismantled.
	   In Washington, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said
Milosevic had withdrawn ``well over 90 percent of the security
force reinforcements.''
	   ``Thanks to NATO pressure and determination, very substantial
steps have been taken toward compliance,'' Lockhart added.

Israel cites U.S. support in warning Palestinians on security
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Tuesday postponed a crucial Cabinet
debate on the new Mideast peace accord.
	   It also said it had U.S. backing for its warning that there
would be no West Bank troop withdrawal unless Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority made good on its security pledges.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting for his political
survival as hard-liners vow to bolt his coalition and force early
elections that could freeze implementation of the new peace
agreement.
	   A centerpiece of the peace agreement, which calls for an Israeli
troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, is a pledge by
the Palestinians to work harder to rein in militants.
	   Israeli officials complain they have not received a Palestinian
action plan for fighting terrorism that was promised during a
nine-day summit at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   Netanyahu's office announced that a Cabinet session planned for
Thursday to ratify the new accord would be postponed until Israel
received the plan.
	   ``It was determined at the Wye Summit that the Palestinians
would, within one week, complete their working plan for fighting
terrorism. However, this evening it became clear that they are not
meeting the agreement scheduled,'' according to the statement.
	   The postponement will likely push back the implementation of the
new agreement.
	   Netanyahu's office released a letter to the Israeli leader from
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in which she affirmed
that each stage of the peace agreement would have to be completed
before moving on.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin would not confirm
the letter or whether any assurances had been given by the
secretary to the Palestinians.
	   Albright, in the letter dated Oct. 23, assured Netanyahu there
were ``procedures in place'' to prevent what Israel terms a
revolving door policy of arresting Palestinian terror suspects and
then releasing them without punishment.
	   ``Furthermore, we will express our opposition to any unwarranted
releases of such suspects, and in the event of such a release, we
will be prepared to express our position publicly,'' the letter
said.
	   On Tuesday, Palestinian police arrested two Palestinian suspects
in the killing of a Jewish settler, Danny Vargas. The Palestinians
also allowed Israeli investigators to cross into their sector of
Hebron to investigate Monday's killing.
	   But Netanyahu said he expected the Palestinian leadership to
condemn the bloodshed, which it has not yet done.
	   ``We expect a denunciation, and we also expect action, full
cooperation in the field of security,'' Netanyahu told reporters.

Former East German communists in state government for first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ The former East German communists
reached a coalition deal Tuesday giving them a share of power at
the state level for the first time in united Germany.
	   The Social Democrats in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, who came
out on top in elections last month, would lead the eastern state's
government, with the ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism as
junior partner.
	   The pact must be approved by conventions of both parties
scheduled Saturday.
	   The ex-communists finished a strong third in the Sept. 27 state
election behind the Christian Democrats, who had led the previous
government.
	   After preliminary talks with the Christian Democrats failed,
governor-elect Harald Ringstorff chose coalition negotiations with
the PDS, the successor to former the Party of Socialist Unity that
ran East Germany under communism.
	   The Social Democrats have governed in another eastern German
state, Saxony-Anhalt, since 1994 with the tacit support of the PDS,
but the ex-communists has never officially been part of a coalition
government.
	   Social Democratic leaders have ruled out working with the PDS at
the federal level, but have increasingly favored forcing the
ex-communists to shoulder responsibility in the struggling eastern
states.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with crackdown on kidnappers begun in graf 2, 10-11,
Basayev and Raduyev speaking. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ More than 2,000 people demanding the
ouster of Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov rallied in the regional
capital on Tuesday, the seventh anniversary of the breakaway
republic's first presidential election.
	   Meanwhile, Chechen law enforcement officials launched a major
offensive Tuesday against kidnappers, beefing up police checkpoints
around the republic and threatening harsher punishment for
hostage-takers.
	   Two former rebel leaders and Maskhadov opponents, Shamil Basayev
and Salman Raduyev, spoke to the crowd, many of whom waved banners
reading ``People are hungry'' and ``Maskhadov go home.''
	   About 500 armed guards, supporters of Raduyev and Basayev,
attended the protest, which followed separate car bomb attacks in
the last two days that killed Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping
official and slightly injured a Muslim cleric.
	   Basayev and Raduyev have frequently accused Maskhadov of
violating Chechnya's constitution, and demand that he be impeached
for failing to bring peace to the republic, which has seen an
increase in violence and kidnappings for ransom since the end of
the 1994-96 war with Russia.
	   Government officials went on state television Monday night to
discourage people from attending the protest.
	   Local residents should ``understand the intentions of opposition
commanders and refrain from coming to the central square,'' said
Presidential Chief of Staff Apti Batalov, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Many field commanders from the war have remained outside the
control of the territory's government, which has unsuccessfully
tried to get them to disband.
	   ``There is no need to celebrate this date on days when the
republic claimed a mourning for the chief of the anti-kidnapping
agency,'' Batalov said.
	   The crackdown on kidnappers had been scheduled to start Sunday,
but the attack on the top anti-kidnapping official forced a delay.
	   ``Organizers of this monstrous (attack) were intending to create
a panic, chaos and distract the attention of law enforcement
agencies from the planned measures for capturing criminal groups,''
Aslanbek Arsayev, Chechnya's security minister, was quoted as
saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Meanwhile, two policemen were wounded Tuesday on Chechnya's
border with Dagestan when unidentified attackers opened fire on
them from inside Chechnya, ITAR-Tass reported. They were not
seriously hurt, it said.
	   Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev seized power in the
republic in the aftermath of the failed 1991 coup against Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev. On Oct. 27, 1991, he was elected as the
region's first president and declared independence from Russia,
which was still part of the Soviet Union.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
war with Russia, but no country has recognized its independence
claim. Moscow insists the territory remains part of Russia.

Iraq rejects contention it used loaded VX on missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore slug &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Tuesday rejected the contention by
U.N. and chemical weapons experts that it had loaded the deadly
nerve agent VX into missile warheads.
	   Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, an adviser to President Saddam Hussein,
said U.N. inspectors were using the issue to prolong the U.N. trade
sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990.
	   The statements ``are a part of a dubious fabrication,'' the
report on state-run television said.
	   A second round of tests on the missile warheads did not provide
further conclusive evidence that Iraq loaded VX on the missiles,
although there were signs that Iraq had cleaned the pieces between
the initial U.S. tests in April and the tests in June and July.
	   Despite the lack of additional proof, U.N. and chemical weapons
experts from seven countries said they were still satisfied with
the tests in April.
	   Saadi, the mastermind of Iraq's chemical weapons program,
reiterated earlier Iraqi claims that Baghdad never succeeded in
stabilizing the VX gas and turning it into a weapon.
	   The conclusion of U.N. experts contradicts fact and is ``full of
disgraceful scientific fallacies,'' he said.
	   Saadi also denied that Iraq tampered with the warheads, saying
any attempt would have been observed by U.N. monitors in Baghdad
who keep the warhead fragments under camera surveillance.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them before
the 15-member Security Council will lift sanctions imposed after
the Gulf War.

Tiger could use composure, patience of Duval
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ His name is on the leaderboard just about every
week, although he rarely goes home with the crystal. To watch him
hammer a drive, to hear the crisp sound of a purely struck iron
leaves no doubt he is one of the most talented player in the game.
	   All Tiger Woods needs now is the belief that last year was no
fluke, the patience that even better things are to come.
	   ``I know that over time, once I get this right, my whole game
will start to follow,'' Woods said. ``It'll start to fall into
place.''
	   And if Woods needs a case study, all he has to do is look at the
latest player to emerge as his chief rival: David Duval.
	   For nearly three years, seven runner-up finishes and a bunch of
other chances, Duval was hounded with questions about why he
couldn't win. There were times he lost a final-round lead, other
times when someone else simply played better, still others when he
couldn't make up enough ground.
	   With seven victories over the last 55 weeks, the best stretch of
golf since Tom Watson in 1980, Duval goes into the Tour
Championship at East Lake Golf Club this week with a chance to
become the first dlrs 3 million man in golf.
	   As much as anything, he attributes his sudden burst to the years
when he was spinning his wheels.
	   ``I felt I would be the better for it,'' Duval said. ``In all
honesty, the struggle to get through something like that, you
appreciate it more than if you did it real quick the first time. I
realized that it's not easy to win out here.''
	   That's part of the burden on Woods.
	   He made it look so easy so quickly. He got his first PGA Tour
victory in just his fifth start, another two weeks later and then a
1997 season that really raised the bar _ four victories, including
his record-setting win at the Masters.
	   But heading into the last PGA Tour event of the year, Woods has
only one victory this year, the BellSouth Classic outside Atlanta
in May.
	   ``The most difficult thing is the fact I have not gotten as many
Ws as I did last year, but I am right there every week,'' he said.
``Last year, that was not the case. I would win or I would be down
the road somewhere. This year, I've been a lot more consistent. You
do what you need to do.''
	   What Woods felt like he needed was to reshape his swing,
particularly his short irons. His swing plane is flatter, his
control is better than it has ever been.
	   His game is right there, waiting to cash in.
	   ``I think his swing has always been very good, but it's better
now,'' Mark O'Meara said.
	   Woods proved that with his third-place finish at the British
Open, where he hit shots he didn't have in his bag a year ago.
	   In the Dunhill Cup at St. Andrews, he played some of the best
golf the Old Course has ever seen _ 14-under through three rounds
in nasty winds. In the end, he cost the American team by missing a
short birdie putt on the last hole in a shocking semifinal loss to
Spain's Santiago Luna.
	   ``I think Tiger Woods is going to win a lot of major
championships before his career is over,'' O'Meara said. ``It's
just a matter of time before he wins again. I think he realizes
that his career ahead of him is a long career, and he has to learn
to pace himself and realize that he is going to struggle at
times.''
	   Woods says he has matured, but the frustration is still evident
on the course. On the 17th hole at Royal Birkdale in this year's
British Open, Woods missed a 10-foot (3-meter) birdie putt and
slammed his putter into the side of the bag.
	   ``You're such a bad putter,'' he muttered to himself through
clinched teeth.
	   Now that the year is almost over, Woods is changing his tune. He
says he is more satisfied with his game this year than he was a
year ago. He has finished in the top 10 in his last seven PGA Tour
events, and 13 times for the year.
	   He is all over the hole, waiting for a putt to drop, hopeful
that one of these days it will.
	   ``It's something you should not get discouraged about,'' Woods
said. ``You can't really fight it. You have to hope to get there
with enough chances where you eventually get some wins.''
	   Duval never experienced sudden success, nor did he _ or anyone
else, for that matter _ face the expectations placed on Woods. But
he knew his time was coming.
	   ``I don't rush things,'' Duval said. ``I let them kind of
evolve.''
	   Woods is still a work in progress. If he can capture the
composure that carried Duval through three lean years, the dam will
break.

Germany swears in seventh postwar chancellor

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ An upbeat Gerhard Schroeder took power
Tuesday as Germany's seventh postwar chancellor, ushering in an era
of political change in Europe's largest nation after 16 years of
conservative rule under Helmut Kohl.
	   The handover represents the most dramatic political transition
Germany has experienced in a generation, from Kohl's conservative
politics defined by childhood memories of World War II to
Schroeder's more liberal world view representative of a generation
born too late in the war to feel the personal burdens.
	   The two men stood side by side as Kohl turned over the offices
of the chancellor to Schroeder; one clearly saddened by the
changes, reminding his successor of the ``great responsibility'' he
will have governing Europe's pivotal nation, the other upbeat,
forward-looking.
	   ``Mr Chancellor, I wish you good fortune,'' Kohl said, blinking
back tears.
	   ``You are facing a challenges completely different than those I
faced when I took office 16 years ago,'' Kohl told Schroeder. ``You
would do well not to become a cynic.''
	   Schroeder thanked Kohl for accepting the election loss with
dignity and ensuring a smooth transition. But half jokingly,
Schroeder made clear his path was forward, telling Kohl, ``I'll
mention you again during my inaugural address, but that will be the
last time.''
	   Schroeder's Social Democratic-led government promises to bring
political change to Germany, broadly speaking to restore a sense
among average Germans that the government is attentive to their
welfare. Its chief goals outlined in a coalition agreement with the
junior governing partner, the Greens, are to put Germans back to
work, to recognize more foreigners living in Germany as citizens
and to abandon nuclear power.
	   But as Schroeder leads Germany into the 21st century, he also
will oversee a two key transitions that Kohl set in motion: the
government's move to Berlin and the adoption of the single European
currency to replace the German mark.
	   The symbolic importance of the government's return to the prewar
capital historically linked to Nazi Germany and the Prussian
military state weighed on Kohl, who cautioned Schroder that one of
his biggest challenges will be ``taking to Berlin what has
flourished in Bonn.''
	   Schroeder already has suggested moving up his move to April,
signaling his eagerness to put his own stamp on government and to
inaugurate the so-called Berlin Republic _ a modern Germany
governed by a generation less burdened by the war. But he made no
broad policy statements during a day of ceremonies stipulated by
the constitution that confirm him as head of government. He was
saving that for an inaugural speech in two weeks.
	   Schroeder's pro-market reputation helped him win centrist voters
who previously mistrusted the left. But since his triumph in the
Sept. 27 election, he has stressed his party's plans to strengthen
the social welfare state, and his commitment to the free market was
called into question after a computer entrepreneur he tapped as a
Cabinet member backed out.
	   Germans are not all that sure who is in charge: Schroeder
himself, or the powerful party chief, Oskar Lafontaine, who
represents traditional leftist values. In a survey released
Tuesday, about 43 percent of 1,003 Germans questioned in a poll
said they believe Lafontaine, who also is the new finance minister,
will be making decisions alongside Schroeder.
	   But in a day that marked his triumph, Schroeder savored every
moment. As the parliament president announced his election by the
new parliament with a vote of 351-287 with 27 abstentions, he
smiled slowly and stood to embrace Lafonatine.
	   And throughout the day, Schroeder emphasized the importance of
political change for a democracy _ while recognizing that Germans
have seen little of it in the last 50 years. Schroeder is only the
seventh postwar chancellor, and the third Social Democrat.
	   ``I liked that you said that government changes come relatively
infrequently in Germany,'' Schroeder quipped with President Roman
Herzog, who as head of state formally recognized the new
chancellor. ``We'd like to keep it that way.''

Lauck back after career-threatening injury
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Anne Marie Lauck was vacationing in Hawaii on a
sunny December day in 1996 when her running career nearly came to a
crashing halt.
	   She and her husband Jim had hiked about four miles and were ``in
the middle of a jungle paradise with beautiful waterfalls'' along
the Napali coastline trail on the island of Kauai when they heard
rumblings.
	   ``Suddenly, there was a rock avalanche at the waterfalls,''
Lauck said Tuesday. ``Rocks started falling all over the place,
from about 400 feet. It was like a war zone.''
	   The Laucks clung to some boulders that already were on the
ground. ``But there was really no place to hide,'' Lauck said.
	   Two rocks, ``the size of office tables,'' headed toward Lauck.
``The first one hit my left shoulder,'' she said.
	   While she was bleeding and in excruciating pain from a compound
fracture of the shoulder, Lauck's husband, who had escaped
unscathed, walked another two miles for help. Finally, a helicopter
transported Lauck to a hospital.
	   Even after the shoulder was set, Lauck was unable to train
properly because her arm was wrapped in a sling for six weeks and
close to her body.
	   But she did train on a treadmill, and that eventually led to an
imbalance in her running gait which resulted in a left hamstring
injury and tendinitis.
	   ``I had changed my biomechanics,'' she said. ``It was
frustrating, because for so many years I had been injury-free.''
	   The injury also led to a split with her coach, Alberto Salazar,
a three-time winner of the New York City Marathon.
	   Salazar lives in Eugene, Oregon and Lauck in Hampton, New
Jersey, which created a communications problem.
	   ``Alberto didn't know the severity of the hamstring,'' Lauck
said, adding that Salazar expected her to do workouts that were
beyond her physical capability. ``He wanted me to train like a
miler.
	   ``But the split was amicable.''
	   Since then, Lauck has coached herself, with the help of her
husband, a chiropractor.
	   She has recuperated well enough to compete in Sunday's New York
City Marathon, her first marathon since finishing 10th at the 1996
Olympics. This will be her third New York City marathon, her first
since placing third in 1994 in 2 hours, 30 minutes, 19 seconds, her
career best. Lauck made her marathon debut in New York in 1993, but
dropped out after 22 miles.
	   In her other marathons, she dropped out of the 1997 Chicago
Marathon, after eight miles, and finished third at the 1996 Olympic
trials.
	   After the shoulder and hamstring injuries and a disappointing
series of races, Lauck became so discouraged she thought about
quitting competitive track.
	   As a possible career change, Lauck went to a massage therapy
school in March and earned a license as a massage therapist.
	   Meanwhile, she realized she couldn't give up her running career.
	   In May, she finished third in the Bay to Breakers 12K race,
``and that gave me optimism,'' she said.
	   When Lauck ran her first marathon five years ago, she figured
she was capable of running in the mid-2:20 range. On Sunday, she
will be satisfied with running about 2:27-2:28, which would be a
career best.
	   ``I'm trying to get down to some viable times,'' she said.
	   In this case, just finishing, after what happened to her in
Hawaii would have to be satisfying to Lauck.

Congo peace talks end with little progress toward implementing
</HEADLINE>
cease-fire
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with close of meeting, ministers adopted a
draft cease-fire plan, but rebels rejecting the proposal. &QL; 
 &UR; By MILDRED MULENGA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ African ministers tentatively endorsed a
cease-fire plan for Congo's civil war at the close of a two-day
meeting Tuesday but Congolese rebels _ who arrived for the meeting
but were excluded from talks _ refused to back the plan.
	   Rebel leader Bizima Karaha said his fighters would not support
the cease-fire proposal until rebel representatives are allowed to
meet directly with representatives of Congolese President Laurent
Kabila.
	   The cease-fire plan, which was drawn up by African and U.N.
experts, was endorsed by the meeting of foreign and defense
ministers from Congo and 11 other African nations, including some
that have intervened in the central African nation's three-month
civil war.
	   Participants did not reveal details of the plan.
	   Kaire Mbuende, secretary-general of the Southern African
Development Community, one of the organizers of the talks, said the
group had worked out a ``mechanism'' for meeting with the rebels
and securing their support for the cease-fire, but declined to say
what it was.
	   The Lusaka talks were the latest effort to bring a cease-fire to
the Congo war, which has drawn in Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad
and reportedly Sudan on the government's side. Rwanda and Uganda
favor the rebels.
	   The rebel forces, composed of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted
members of Kabila's army and opposition politicians, accuse Kabila
of corruption, mismanagement and stirring up ethnic rivalries since
overthrowing dictator Mobutu Sese Seko 17 months ago.
	   On Monday and Tuesday, delegates held closed meetings at a hotel
in the Zambian capital, while U.N. and African envoys conferred
separately with rebels at the same hotel.
	   Joining Congo representatives in the talks were delegations from
Angola, Gabon, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa,
Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Zambia.
	   Karaha, the rebel representatives, said Congolese Foreign
Minister Jean Charles Okoto and Congo's military allies
consistently refused to meet with the rebels.
	   ``We can't have a situation where they put us in one place and
have a conference in another place. We must have direct
negotiations,'' Karaha said.
	   Zambian officials said there was tension at the ministers'
meeting when some participants demanded that all countries with
troops in Congo admit to it.
	   Kabila has claimed Rwandan troops are fighting alongside the
rebels in Congo, but Rwandan officials stood by their earlier
denials that this was so, said the Zambian officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Earlier, Zambia's President Frederick Chiluba intervened to try
to jar loose the deadlock.
	   Chiluba called the Rwandan and Ugandan foreign ministers to his
official residence after acrimonious exchanges between them and
Congolese officials and their allies, officials said. No details
were released.
	   Uganda also reportedly backs the rebels and has troops in
eastern Congo. Uganda says its forces are there to attack
Congo-based Ugandan rebels.
	   Congolese Foreign Minister Jean Charles Okoto told reporters
Rwandan and Ugandan troops must ``move out of Congo.''
	   ``If nothing conclusive comes out on this, we will continue
fighting,'' he said.
	   Okoto also described Karaha, the rebel leader, as ``a terrorist.
He needs to be arrested immediately.''
	   Okoto accused Rwanda and Uganda of having ``a hidden agenda'' to
crush ethnic Hutus opposed to their support for Tutsis, the
region's powerful minority ethnic group.
	   Rwanda Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana described Congo as ``the
destabilizing element'' in central Africa and said Congo was
allowing its territory to be used as a springboard for attacks by
Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.

US non-proliferation official meets Russian officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top U.S. weapons proliferation expert questioned
Russian officials Tuesday about their efforts to tighten export
controls to limit illegal arms sales, a news report said.
	   Robert Gallucci, U.S. presidential envoy for non-proliferation
issues, met Russia's Security Council Secretary Nikolai Bordyuzha
in Moscow on Tuesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Bordyuzha promised that Russia's government is pushing for
stricter export controls on weapons. The government has submitted a
bill on export controls to the lower house of parliament.
	   ``We are doing everything for this law to be passed soon,''
Bordyuzha said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Russia's defense industry is keen to make sure such controls
don't limit legitimate arms deals, a crucial source of income for
the cash-starved country.
	   Gallucci is a retired diplomat who played a key role in an
agreement with North Korea to freeze its nuclear weapons program.

Champ and challenger finally show up for fight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey AP) _ Prince Naseem Hamed, delayed
because he didn't have a work permit, and Wayne McCullough, delayed
by questions about getting paid, arrived in this seaside gambling
city Tuesday only four days before their WBO featherweight title
fight.
	   McCullough, the challenger from Ireland, arrived early Tuesday
from Las Vegas, where he is based.
	   Hamed, the champion from England, arrived in New York on the
Concord and was driven to Atlantic City.
	   ``I will knock him out at 2:28 of the third round,'' the cocky
Hamed told Ed Keenan of Media Works, who met his flight from
London. The fight is set for Saturday night in the Boardwalk
Convention Center and will be televised by HBO.
	   Hamed's late arrival was because he had neglected to get a work
permit, something that wasn't taken care of up 6:30 p.m. London
time Monday.
	   McCullough and his promoter, America Presents, had expressed
concern over his dlrs 500,000 purse being guaranteed.
	   ``I'm the one responsible to pay him, and I will pay him,'' said
Cedric Kushner, who replaced Frank Warren, Hamed's promoter, as
promoter of the match. That was because the assets of Warren's
company, Sports Network, were frozen due to a legal battle with Don
King.
	   Hamed's purse, reportedly about dlrs 2 million, is guaranteed by
HBO.
	   Warren and King were to have formed a partnership, but Warren
accused the American promoter of fraudulently fixing the contract
in his favor, making it void. King sued, and a court in London
ruled that he was entitled to half of Sports Network's income.
Warren has appealed, and a ruling is due in January.
	   Kushner, a South African based in New York, said he was asked by
Warren and HBO to be the promoter of record for a fee.
	   Told that Warren and HBO and owed him a favor, Kushner replied.
``I would like to think they owe me two.''

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Here are excerpts of Tuesday's
statement by NATO Secretary General Javier Solana after the
alliance's ambassadors extended indefinitely the threat of
airstrikes against Yugoslavia:
	   ``Two weeks ago, NATO issued an ACTORD (Activation Order) for
limited air operations and a phased air campaign against Yugoslavia
... to back up diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in Kosovo.
	   ``From the outset we have insisted on full and unconditional
compliance by President Milosevic with United Nations Security
Council Resolutions 1199 and 1203.
	   ``NATO's unity and resolve have forced the Yugoslav Special
Police and military units to exercise restraint and reduce their
intimidating presence in Kosovo. We have been able to reduce the
level of violence significantly and to achieve a cease-fire which
has held, despite some sporadic incidents.
	   ``This improvement in the security situation in Kosovo has first
and foremost allowed an immediate improvement in the humanitarian
situation. International relief organisations have re-started their
operations in Kosovo. They now have unrestricted access for their
convoys. Thousands of displaced persons have returned to their
villages. At the same time, the improvement in the security
situation is creating the conditions for a meaningful political
dialogue to begin between Belgrade and the Kosovar Albanians.
	   ``Over the past few days, NATO's aerial surveillance assets and
the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission have been verifying whether
Mr. Milosevic's actions match the commitments he has made to us.
	   ``Over the past 24 hours, over 4,000 members of the Special
Police have been withdrawn from Kosovo. Police and military units
that are normally based in Kosovo are now moving back in their
barracks together with their heavy weapons. Check points have been
dismantled. Most police and military units that are normally based
elsewhere in Yugoslavia have left Kosovo. The security forces are
returning to the level they were at before the present crisis
began.
	   ``NATO's objective remains to achieve full compliance with UNSC
Resolutions 1199 and 1203 (and we) have decided this evening to
maintain the ACTORD for limited air operations. Its execution will
be subject to a decision and assessments by the North Atlantic
Council.
	   ``If we see evidence of substantial non compliance in the future
with UNSC Resolution 1199, then we will be ready to use force.
	   ``The Kosovar Albanians must equally comply with the UNSC
Resolutions and cooperate with the international community. I call
on the Kosovar Albanian armed groups to maintain the ceasefire that
they have declared.
	   ``Our NATO verification flights over Kosovo are beginning.
	   ``NATO and the OSCE (Orgnaization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe) have been working closely together to co-ordinate their
activities in carrying out the verification mission. The Alliance
is also expediting planning for a NATO force for the extraction of
the OSCE verifiers on the ground in Kosovo.
	   ``This crisis is far from over. The international community will
not tolerate a continuation of the status quo. I urge both sides to
take advantage of the opportunity that now exists to move the
political process forward and to secure this unique opportunity to
work for a better future for Kosovo.''

UCI calls on race organizers not to demand too much from riders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The International Cycling Union
said Tuesday it has called on all organizers of cycling races not
to demand more than can reasonably be expected from riders.
	   The letter from the sport's world governing body follows
consultations over the sport's growing drug crisis in the wake of
this year's scandal-plagued Tour de France.
	   It ``expressed ... to the organizers the recommendation to
respect the correct balance between the `character' of cycling, as
an endurance sport, and the efforts that can reasonably be made of
a well-trained athlete,'' the UCI said in a statement.
	   The world body called on riders' representatives and sporting
groups who met in August with top UCI officials to take part in a
study next year to determine whether professional cyclists'
obligations are physically too demanding.
	   It also invited them to help in drawing up ``a code which will
be signed by all riders and team officials rejecting doping in any
form.''
	   After the August meetings, the UCI said it would impose a
``medical follow-up'' for riders and a new drug-detection system as
part of a raft of new measures to crack down on doping.
	   The Festina team was thrown out of the Tour de France because
its riders were said to have taken the hormone EPO. Six more teams
withdrew protesting police investigations.
	   Also Tuesday, the UCI said the Swiss Grand Prix will conserve
its World Cup status in 1999.
	   At this year's race in Zurich in August, a security motorcycle
whizzed across the track just two meters in front of racers in
their final sprint to the finish line.
	   The world body said the event would remain a Grand Prix only if
organizers, in association with Swiss police, gave safety
guarantees by the beginning of October.

Angolan parliament revokes former guerilla leader's special status
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The government used its majority in
parliament to push through a bill Tuesday revoking the special
status granted to the leader of the former rebel group UNITA as
part of the country's 1994 peace deal.
	   The move deepened recent tension between the former foes and was
the latest sign that the United Nations-brokered peace accord,
which ended a two-decade civil war, is unraveling.
	   The bill passed 115-0, with all lawmakers of the governing MPLA
voting in favor. UNITA's 61 deputies abstained, saying the measure
was invalid and that the peace deal stipulated that the special
status for their leader Jonas Savimbi could be revoked only with
his prior consent.
	   The status included benefits such as armed bodyguards, a house
and salary provided by the state, and free travel abroad. However,
Savimbi has refused to travel to the capital Luanda to take
advantage of the benefits.
	   The ruling MPLA _ a Portuguese acronym for the Popular Movement
for the Liberation of Angola _ has accused Savimbi of failing to
comply with the peace pact, saying he has kept an army hidden in
the bush of the vast southwest African nation.
	   Supporters of the two sides have engaged in skirmishes in rural
areas in recent months.
	   UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
has refused to hand over its remaining central highland strongholds
to the government.
	   The government severed all contact with Savimbi in September and
has waged an international diplomatic campaign to isolate him.
	   The U.N. has imposed sanctions on UNITA for its failure to
comply with the peace accord, including a freeze on its bank
accounts and a travel ban on its officials.
	   A 1991 peace agreement collapsed the following year when Savimbi
rejected his defeat in the country's first democratic elections and
returned to war.
	   The fighting between UNITA and the MPLA erupted after the
country's 1975 independence from Portugal.

Yeltsin checks into sanitarium for open-ended stay

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An infirm Boris Yeltsin sought sanctuary Tuesday
at a rest home outside Moscow, retreating further from the
political spotlight and leaving the country guessing about the
exact nature of his illness.
	   The Russian leader, who has been an infrequent visitor to the
Kremlin in recent months, checked into the Barvikha sanitarium for
an open-ended stay to recover from what's been described as high
blood pressure and exhaustion.
	   Yeltsin has played only a marginal role in dealing with the
country's painful economic crisis, and some analysts say the
country is being guided mostly by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
who has been in office less than two months.
	   ``Ever since he was appointed, Primakov has been acting more as
a president than as a chairman of the government,'' said Nikolai
Petrov, a political analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for Peace
in Moscow.
	   Primakov traveled to Vienna, Austria, on Tuesday to fill in for
Yeltsin at a summit between Russia and the European Union. Yeltsin
called off the trip Monday due to his illness, the latest in a
string of maladies that have dogged him for years.
	   Primakov and Yeltsin met early Tuesday at the president's
Gorky-9 country residence outside Moscow before the prime minister
left for Vienna and Yeltsin moved to the sanitarium.
	   Russian television broadcast pictures of Yeltsin sitting in a
chair behind a small table and talking to Primakov. Yeltsin,
wearing a blue sweater, was not visibly ill. He nodded in response
to Primakov's comments, but their words were not broadcast.
	   Dr. Michael DeBakey, an American cardiologist who consulted with
Yeltsin's doctors before and after his 1996 heart surgery,
predicted Tuesday it would take Yeltsin more than a week to bounce
back. But ``he'll recover from all this and he'll be back at
work,'' DeBakey told The Associated Press in Houston.
	   He said the Kremlin medical team has not approached him about
Yeltsin's latest illness. ``Based on the information I've been able
to put together, he had a very bad cold, kind of flu-like
bronchitis that sort of knocked him out.''
	   The president and his doctors say Yeltsin has no crippling
illness and will serve out his term, which lasts until the middle
of the year 2000.
	   Still, few people in Russia believe that Yeltsin, 67, will ever
again be the robust, reform-minded leader that he was during his
early years in power.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Tuesday that Yeltsin's
aides were ``mocking'' Russians by insisting the president had no
serious health problems.
	   ``Mr. Yeltsin's inability to work has been obvious to us for
quite a long time,'' Zyuganov told a news conference. He called for
Yeltsin to undergo an independent medical exam and for the results
to be made public.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Tuesday that Yeltsin's illness should not hamper decisions on
economic policy because Primakov has a mandate on that issue.
	   He added that Yeltsin remains Russia's popularly elected
president, and the United States will continue to work with him on
that basis.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder wasted no time
taking charge Tuesday, making his first Cabinet decision within
hours of being sworn in as new German leader.
	   Schroeder approved sending up to 200 unarmed German observers to
help monitor the withdrawal of Serb forces from Yugoslavia's Kosovo
province under the continuing threat of NATO airstrikes.
	   At the same time, Schroeder's spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said
the new government was relieved that NATO decided Tuesday not to
launch raids in Kosovo for now.
	   Former chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed with Schroeder during
Germany's transition of power that German warplanes would
participate in any airstrikes aimed at ending war in the province,
where ethnic Albanian rebels are seeking independence.

Six consortiums register for Mexican southeast airports package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Six consortiums registered to bid on a
package of airports in southeast Mexico that the government is
privatizing, an official said Tuesday.
	   Jorge Silberstein of the Communications and Transportation
Department said the consortiums are due to submit technical and
economic bids on Nov. 17.
	   The airport package is anchored by the airport in the Caribbean
resort of Cancun. The southeastern group also includes the airports
of Merida, Villahermosa, Cozumel, Oaxaca, Huatulco, Minatitlan,
Tapachula and Veracruz.
	   Bidders were required to form consortiums, each of which must
include one airport operator and a Mexican partner, each of which
must have a 25.5 percent stake. The deadline for the registration
of consortiums was Oct. 23.
	   Italy's Societa Esercizi Aeroportuali Spa and U.S.-based Ogden
Corp. have formed a consortium with local partner Grupo Villacero,
which is the holding company of Mexican steelmaker Siderurgica
Lazaro Cardenas Las Truchas, Silberstein said.
	   A second consortium has been formed by Mexican construction
giant Empresas ICA Sociedad Controladora SA and Dutch concern
Schiphol International B.V., the operator of Amsterdam's Schiphol
airport and the international wing of New York's John F. Kennedy
airport.
	   Mexican shipping concern Transportacion Maritima Mexicana joined
forces with Spain-based Banco Central Hispano and Grupo
Ferrominero, the controlling concern of Mexican mining concern
Compania Minera Autlan. The airport operator partner is
Canada-based Aeroports de Montreal International.
	   Another consortium was formed by Controempresas SA, owned by the
Losada family, the controlling shareholders of local supermarket
chain Grupo Gigante SA and Spanish airport operator AENA Servicios
Aeronauticos SA.
	   The fifth consortium was formed by France's Aeroports de Paris
and Aeroplazas de Mexico SA, the operator of the commercial area at
the airport in the Pacific resort of Puerto Vallarta.
	   Another group has been formed by local construction concern
Grupo Tribasa SA, Denmark's Copenhagen Airports A/S, Spanish
construction company Grupo Ferrovial SA, and France-based Groupe
GTM, a unit of Suez-Lyonnaise des Eaux.
	   Flughafen Frankfurt Main AG, the operator of Germany's Frankfurt
Rhein-Main airport, decided not to participate, Silberstein said.
The German operator is planning to bid on other airport packages,
such as the Pacific group, led by the airport in Guadalajara, the
country's second largest city. The group includes 11 other airports
in western Mexico.

Calls for revenge after West Bank slayings; suspects arrested
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli cabinet postponed, ban on Israeli travel
lifted
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Showing resolve to keep their part of the new
peace agreement with Israel, Palestinian security forces on Tuesday
arrested two Palestinian suspects in the grisly killing of a Jewish
settler in the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   An impromptu stone memorial set up Tuesday in the spot where
29-year-old Danny Vargas was dumped from his car by his killers a
day before bore the inscription ``avenge the blood.''
	   In a second funeral Tuesday, some 3,000 Palestinians buried an
elderly Palestinian, Mohammed Zalout, who was bludgeoned to death
near a Jewish settlement, apparently by an Israeli extremist.
	   The crowd chanted ``revenge, revenge,'' and the Israeli army
briefly declared Palestinian towns in the West Bank off-limits to
Israelis, apparently because of growing concern about revenge
attacks. The ban was lifted after several hours.
	   Despite the latest cycle of violence, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said he was determined to withdraw troops from 13 percent
of the West Bank over the next 12 weeks.
	   ``The only thing that can prevent the implementation of the
agreement is if the (Israeli) Cabinet does not approve it, or if
the Palestinians do not fulfill it,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu later postponed a cabinet session to ratify the accord
because the Palestinians had not yet delivered a working document
on security. A statement by Netanyahu's office said the cabinet
would convene after Israel receives the document. The postponement
was likely to delay implementation of the deal.
	   Earlier, Netanyahu was evasive when asked whether he would
freeze a withdrawal if parliament passes an early elections bill
that has been approved for a first reading by parliament.
	   Israeli media speculated Tuesday that Netanyahu might try to
discourage the dovish opposition from backing the bill by declaring
that in the event of early elections he would suspend the pullback.
	   Netanyahu said he would not relate to the possibility of spring
elections because he hoped ``it will not happen.''
	   The most vocal critics of Netanyahu have been Jewish settlers
and their representatives in parliament. At Vargas' open grave,
politicians and friends delivering eulogies demanded that Netanyahu
go back on his promise to withdraw from West Bank land.
	   ``You promised us peace and security, and we have neither,''
said legislator Rehavam Zeevi from the far-right opposition party
Moledet, referring to Netanyahu. His speech was punctuated by
shouts of ``wage war'' by some of the mourners.
	   Monday's two killings put the new peace agreement to a first
test. A centerpiece of the agreement is a pledge by the
Palestinians to work harder to rein in militants.
	   Demonstrating a new attitude, Palestinian security forces who
had suspended cooperation with Israel for most of the past 17
months on Tuesday arrested two suspects in the Vargas killing.
	   Ahmed Tibi, a spokesman for Arafat, said one of the men was
believed to have shot Vargas and another to have served as an
accomplice. The two men are residents of Hebron, but Tibi did not
say whether they had ties to a Palestinian political faction.
	   The two suspects also confessed to killing a Jewish seminary
student earlier this month near the communal farm of Ora south of
Jerusalem, Tibi said.
	   Israel army radio identified the main suspect as Jamal Jadallah
and said he denied during interrogation that he had any ties to the
Islamic militant group Hamas, the main opponent to peace with
Israel.
	   Despite the new cooperation, Israeli troops reacted harshly to
the killing of the settler, clamping a curfew on the downtown area
of Hebron they control and sealing the city so Palestinians could
not leave or enter.
	   The curfew barred some 30,000 Palestinians from leaving their
homes. During the crackdown, troops entered a girls' elementary
school and ordered the students, some of them crying, to go home.
	   Since August, downtown Hebron residents have already been under
curfew twice for a total of three weeks, and the new restrictions
embittered many Palestinians.
	   ``We thought that we could now go to Gaza, but we cannot even
leave our homes,'' said Khalil Jaberi, 26, referring to a provision
in the accord for a new land route for Palestinians between the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.

 &UR; NATO extends airstrike threat as Serb forces redeploy in Kosovo
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMS; LEADS throughout with pullout encouraging
some refugees to return, but many remain fearful; Changes BYLINE,
DATELINE. no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSTROZUB, Yugoslavia (AP) - NATO decided Tuesday that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic will not keep his word on ending the
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo unless the alliance
maintains a real threat of force.
	   To keep up the pressure, the 16-nation military alliance decided
to maintain more than 400 NATO warplanes on alert, but did not set
any new deadlines for airstrikes after the previous one expired at
1900 GMT Tuesday.
	   That news should cheer the hundreds of thousands of refugees,
terrified of returning home unless government troops and Serb
police are held back.
	   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana told a news conference after a 2
1/2-hour meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium.
	   Diplomatic observers reported that as many as 4,100 Serb
policemen pulled out of Kosovo on Monday alone, vacating many
villages and dug-in positions. That encouraged a few among the
300,000 displaced people in this largely ethnic Albanian province
to take a chance on returning home.
	   ``We have observed what I would consider significant reductions
in the Serbian police presence in the field,'' said Shaun Byrnes,
head of the American section of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission, spearhead of what eventually will be 2,000 ``ground
verifiers'' who will make sure that Milosevic is living up to his
promises.
	   ``Last night, we watched convoys of Serbian police leaving
Kosovo and going north into Serbia proper,'' he said. ``We
estimated that there were roughly 4,100. That's quite a few
policemen.''
	   The Clinton administration said observations on the ground
indicated Milosevic was in ``substantial compliance,'' meaning the
threat of allied military intervention has been, at least for the
moment, averted.
	   As the diplomats were pondering how to deal with Milosevic,
Avdullah Krasniqi, an ethnic Albanian from this small community
southwest of Pristina, loaded up his farm wagon with wife, kids and
household goods and headed home Tuesday. He made his decision less
out of confidence that NATO had forced an end to the crisis than
the fact that it was getting colder by the day in his mountain
refuge.
	   Among the demands made by American negotiator Richard Holbrooke
in his Oct. 12 peace deal with Milosevic were reduction of troops
and police in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 10 to
1, to levels of last February when fighting broke out between
government forces and the independence-seeking Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   ``We spent three months in the mountains,'' Krasniqi said in a
roadside conversation as family members sat in a wagon on a huge
pile of carpets, kitchen utensils and other household goods, all
pulled by the family tractor. ``It's very cold.''
	   The Krasniqis wanted very badly to go home, but they are still
wary.
	   ``We don't have any faith in Milosevic,'' he said, licking his
thick dark moustache, and noting that his next-door neighbor was
shot and killed on his doorstep.
	   Neither the diplomatic observers nor Associated Press reporters
saw any roadblocks or checkpoints anywhere they traveled in the
province Tuesday.
	   In Malisevo, a former KLA stronghold 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina, hundreds of ethnic Albanians filled the
streets Tuesday morning, revisiting for the first time the homes
and shops they abandoned when Serb forces overran the town July 28.
	   The top floor of Osman Mazreku's two-story house had been gutted
by fire. Clothing and garbage were strewn across the ground floor.
	   ``I'm sorry to see my house in this condition, but I'm happy to
be alive,'' he said. ``That's all that matters.''
	   No one planned to stay the night, however, or bring their
families back until police vacated a building on edge of the
village. As if to underscore the uncertainty, the streets emptied
after a short burst of automatic rifle fire when a small convoy of
armored police vehicles arrived to reinforce the police presence at
the building.
	   In Orahovac, 16 kilometers (10 miles) down the road, Batishahe
Isma stood in the doorway of her once-comfortable home, eyes
roaming over the mess and destruction left behind by the police who
occupied it for three months.
	   ``They took everything but the floor,'' she said, waving her
broom vaguely. ``What they didn't take they slashed or burned.''
	   Scrawled across one bedroom door was the written in Serbian:
``This is the place where the terrorists lived.'' On another door:
``This is Serbia, when are you going to understand this?''
	   Hugh Parmer of the U.S. Agency for International Development
visited a number of Kosovo villages and towns, his first trip here
in seven weeks.
	   ``The biggest difference is the hope I saw in the peoples' eyes
now compared to the fear I saw seven weeks ago,'' he said. ``It is
still a difficult situation, but if these people go home we will
have a manageable humanitarian situation. There should be no deaths
in the winter.''

Spiritual leader calls on party to oppose peace deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Netanyahu, Sharon meeting Shapira,

 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The spiritual leader of a powerful Jewish
religious party urged his followers Tuesday to reject the new
Mideast peace agreement.
	   Rabbi Avraham Shapira, the spiritual leader of the National
Religious Party who wields great influence over Jewish settlers,
ruled that it is forbidden to ``give a hand to this horrible
agreement.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon were expected to meet with Shapira later Tuesday to explain
the deal to the rabbi, Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky, said.
	   The party belongs to the prime minister's coalition government,
which survived a no-confidence vote over the peace accord Monday.
	   The agreement, which was negotiated during nine days at the Wye
Plantation in Maryland and signed at the White House on Friday,
calls for Israel to hand over 13 percent more of the West Bank to
Palestinian civilian control. That means some Jewish settlements
will be surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory, except for
access roads.
	   Many religious Jews believe that the West Bank is part of the
biblical land of Israel promised to Jews by God, and that giving it
up would be a sin.
	   Although the government would lose its majority in parliament if
the NRP withdrew its support, the opposition Labor party has
offered Netanyahu a safety net of support on all issues relating to
the peace process.
	   In 1995, when then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was moving to
withdraw Israeli troops from largely Palestinian cities, settlers
and right-wing politicians demonstrated violently against the
plans, painting Rabin as a traitor. In November of that year, Rabin
was assassinated by a right-wing religious Jew who opposed
land-for-peace.
	   With the third anniversary of Rabin's death approaching, the
same groups are calling Netanyahu a traitor with blood on his
hands, stirring up fears in Israel that there could be another
political killing.
	   Asked on Israel radio whether another assassination was
possible, Benny Elon, a lawmaker from the ultra-nationalist Moledet
party answered, ``Yes, of course.''
	   Israeli media reported this week that security had been
increased for Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai after
the two returned from last week's summit.

Runaway gymnast, parents meet face-to-face
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Gymnast Dominique Moceanu confronted her parents
for the first time since running away from home and suing them for
her independence during a deposition Tuesday at an undisclosed
location.
	   While details of the meeting were kept secret, both sides were
expected to come face-to-face for the first time in public during a
hearing Wednesday to determine whether the 17-year-old gymnast is
safe living away from home.
	   Miss Moceanu's parents sought the emergency hearing, alleging in
court documents that her coach and two others are improperly
influencing the Olympic gold-medal winner.
	   They claim the coach, Luminita Miscenco of Romania, is
``illegally in the United States and may be subject to deportation
immediately.'' Ms. Miscenco's work visa is sponsored by Dumitru
Moceanu, who fired her Oct. 17 when his daughter bolted.
	   Miss Moceanu's parents allege Ms. Miscenco, 26, fellow coach
Jeff Pudlo, 23, and friend Brian Huggins, 32, convinced the gymnast
to run away. A statement by former Moceanu masseuse Janice Ward
further insinuates that Huggins and Miss Moceanu had an improper
relationship dating back two years.
	   ``This has gone way over the limit. How can somebody stoop so
low?'' Miss Moceanu told the Houston Chronicle in Tuesday's
editions. She has moved into her own apartment, the location of
which is being concealed from her parents.
	   Her court-appointed attorney, who is seeking to become Miss
Moceanu's guardian until the court decides whether she is a legal
adult, worried that such allegations could affect her career.
	   ``I do not know of any hard proof or evidence regarding any
inappropriate relationship, yet her own parents are making this
statement in public court documents, which has to impact her
marketability, her career and her self-esteem,'' attorney Ellen
Yarrell said Tuesday.
	   ``I'm incredulous that a statement of that nature could be made
by a parent about their child unless they had significant proof,
and even then I don't think I'd make that statement.''
	   Huggins said the only reason he is helping Miss Moceanu is to
ensure her safety. He, Ms. Miscenco and Pudlo all say that Miss
Moceanu chose on her own to leave her parents, the Chronicle
reported.
	   Miss Moceanu's parents also claim that Ms. Yarrell was out of
town toward the end of last week, leaving the gymnast vulnerable.
Ms. Yarrell retorted she was ``insulted'' by the argument.
	   The gymnast sued on Oct. 19 to be certified as an adult and
placed in charge of the money she has earned in her seven-year
professional career. She believes her father has squandered much of
the money to build a gymnasium in the Houston suburb of Spring.
	   The trust is structured so that Miss Moceanu won't gain control
over the assets until she turns 35, Ms. Yarrell said. If the
Moceanus' parental rights are severed, Ms. Yarrell said Miss
Moceanu might be able to gain access to the funds early.
	   It's unclear how much money, if any, remains in the trust.
	   The hearing on Miss Moceanu's request to be certified an adult
is scheduled for Nov. 11, but a request to delay that hearing will
be heard Nov. 4, as well as Ms. Yarrell's motion for guardianship
and a request to have the entire matter dropped.
	   Ms. Yarrell anticipates the Moceanus will win their request for
a delay. If so, the case could stretch into next year, she said.
	   ``That's not in the family's best interest, certainly not in
Dominique's best interest,'' Ms. Yarrell said.

Writer Ian McEwan wins Booker Prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ian McEwan won the prestigious Booker Prize for
fiction on Tuesday for his novel, ``Amsterdam.''
	   McEwan, collected a 20,000 pound (dlrs 33,000) check at the 1998
awards ceremony in London's Guildhall.
	   ``Amsterdam'' tells the story of two men embroiled in scandal
when the lover of both is photographed in compromising positions
with the foreign secretary.
	   ``I feel as if I'm in a dream as I'm sure all winners before me
have felt too,'' the author said as he recevied his award from
former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. It was McEwan's third
nomination.
	   A Booker Prize can more than double hardback sales and has
greatly boosted library readership of winning books.
	   The prize, established in 1968, is bestowed each year on the
best novel written in English in Britain or Commonwealth nations.
	   The bookmakers' favorite to win had been Beryl Bainbridge's
``Master Georgie,'' set in the Crimean War. Bainbridge has been
nominated five times for the Booker.
	   Other nominees were Julian Barnes' satire ``England, England;''
Patrick McCabe's ``Breakfast On Pluto,'' about an Irish
transvestive during the 1970s Northern Ireland troubles; ``The
Restraint of Beasts,'' the debut novel of bus driver Magnus Mills,
about two Scots fence builders, and Martin Booth's ``The Industry
Of Souls.'' about a man imprisoned as a spy for 20 years in a
Soviet labor camp.

	   OSTROZUB, Yugoslavia (AP) - NATO decided Tuesday that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic will not keep his word on ending the
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo unless the alliance
maintains a real threat of force.
	   To keep up the pressure, the 16-nation military alliance decided
to maintain more than 400 NATO warplanes on alert, but did not set
any new deadlines for airstrikes after the previous one expired at
1900 GMT Tuesday.
	   That news should cheer the hundreds of thousands of refugees,
terrified of returning home unless government troops and Serb
police are held back.
	   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana told a news conference after a 2
1/2-hour meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium.
	   Diplomatic observers reported that as many as 4,100 Serb
policemen pulled out of Kosovo on Monday alone, vacating many
villages and dug-in positions. That encouraged a few among the
300,000 displaced people in this largely ethnic Albanian province
to take a chance on returning home.
	   ``We have observed what I would consider significant reductions
in the Serbian police presence in the field,'' said Shaun Byrnes,
head of the American section of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission, spearhead of what eventually will be 2,000 ``ground
verifiers'' who will make sure that Milosevic is living up to his
promises.
	   ``Last night, we watched convoys of Serbian police leaving
Kosovo and going north into Serbia proper,'' he said. ``We
estimated that there were roughly 4,100. That's quite a few
policemen.''
	   The Clinton administration said observations on the ground
indicated Milosevic was in ``substantial compliance,'' meaning the
threat of allied military intervention has been, at least for the
moment, averted.
	   As the diplomats were pondering how to deal with Milosevic,
Avdullah Krasniqi, an ethnic Albanian from this small community
southwest of Pristina, loaded up his farm wagon with wife, kids and
household goods and headed home Tuesday. He made his decision less
out of confidence that NATO had forced an end to the crisis than
the fact that it was getting colder by the day in his mountain
refuge.
	   Among the demands made by American negotiator Richard Holbrooke
in his Oct. 12 peace deal with Milosevic were reduction of troops
and police in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
10-to-1, to levels of last February when fighting broke out between
government forces and the independence-seeking Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   ``We spent three months in the mountains,'' Krasniqi said in a
roadside conversation as family members sat in a wagon on a huge
pile of carpets, kitchen utensils and other household goods, all
pulled by the family tractor. ``It's very cold.''
	   The Krasniqis wanted very badly to go home, but they are still
wary.
	   ``We don't have any faith in Milosevic,'' he said, licking his
thick dark mustache, and noting that his next-door neighbor was
shot and killed on his doorstep.
	   Neither the diplomatic observers nor Associated Press reporters
saw any roadblocks or checkpoints anywhere they traveled in the
province Tuesday.
	   In Malisevo, a former KLA stronghold 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina, hundreds of ethnic Albanians filled the
streets Tuesday morning, revisiting for the first time the homes
and shops they abandoned when Serb forces overran the town July 28.
	   The top floor of Osman Mazreku's two-story house had been gutted
by fire. Clothing and garbage were strewn across the ground floor.
	   ``I'm sorry to see my house in this condition, but I'm happy to
be alive,'' he said. ``That's all that matters.''
	   No one planned to stay the night, however, or bring their
families back until police vacated a building on edge of the
village. As if to underscore the uncertainty, the streets emptied
after a short burst of automatic rifle fire when a small convoy of
armored police vehicles arrived to reinforce the police presence at
the building.
	   In Orahovac, 16 kilometers (10 miles) down the road, Batishahe
Isma stood in the doorway of her once-comfortable home, eyes
roaming over the mess and destruction left behind by the police who
occupied it for three months.
	   ``They took everything but the floor,'' she said, waving her
broom vaguely. ``What they didn't take they slashed or burned.''
	   Scrawled across one bedroom door was the written in Serbian:
``This is the place where the terrorists lived.'' On another door:
``This is Serbia, when are you going to understand this?''
	   Hugh Parmer of the U.S. Agency for International Development
visited a number of Kosovo villages and towns, his first trip here
in seven weeks.
	   ``The biggest difference is the hope I saw in the peoples' eyes
now compared to the fear I saw seven weeks ago,'' he said. ``It is
still a difficult situation, but if these people go home we will
have a manageable humanitarian situation. There should be no deaths
in the winter.''

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch cut through the
western Caribbean on Tuesday, pummeling coastal Honduras and Belize
with driving rain and fierce winds that bent palm trees and sent
thousands of people fleeing for higher ground.
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of
maximum alert and sent in troops to evacuate thousands of people
from villages on the sparsely populated coast. Thousands more made
their way to safer ground on their own.
	   Most of the population of Belize City fled inland in cars and
government buses, while tourists rushed to find ways out of the
Mexican resorts of Cancun and Cozumel, where the storm is expected
to hit by the end of the week.
	   At 2100 GMT, Mitch was about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of
Honduras and moving west-southwest _ roughly parallel to the coast
_ at 6 mph (10 kph). Its winds dropped from 180 mph (290 kph) to
near 155 mph (250 kph), reducing Mitch to a Category 4 hurricane,
one category below the most powerful. But the 350-mile
(600-kilometer) -wide storm remained very powerful _ and dangerous.
	   Mitch's slow speed made the hurricane's path especially
unpredictable, forecasters said.
	   Earlier in the day, when Mitch's winds were at 180 mph (290 kph)
_ a Category 5 storm _ the U.S. National Weather Service said only
three Atlantic storms were stronger _ Gilbert in 1988, Allen in
1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.
	   Strong winds bent palm trees along the Honduran coast Tuesday,
and heavy rain caused at least four rivers to overflow their banks.
The entire coast of Honduras was under a hurricane warning, and up
to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain was forecast in mountainous
areas.
	   In La Ceiba, on the western Honduran coast, residents of the La
Barra fled to shelters set up in schools and fire stations on
higher ground. The neighborhood has the sea to the north, the
Cangrejal River to the east and a creek to the west.
	   Fisherman Manuel Padilla said he wanted to evacuate with his
three children but authorities had not told him where the shelters
were located.
	   ``Nobody has come to see us,'' he complained. ``They've
forgotten us.''
	   Still, hundreds of people waded through knee-deep waters to
safety. At one fire station shelter, about 150 people huddled in
the damp, with no dry blankets or other protection from the chill.
Some brought pets, including five parrots.
	   Blanca Almeida Ramirez, 22, said she and her three children fled
early Tuesday when water began to seep into her wooden house. ``The
wood is all rotten inside,'' she said. ``I couldn't stay any
longer.''
	   The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco,
said 5,000 soldiers were deployed to help victims of the storm.
	   Five villages in the northeastern province of Gracias a Dios
were cut off by flooding, but police evacuated all 2,000 residents
before the rivers rose, said national police chief Col. Anael
Perez. Two other villages were cut off by fallen trees.
	   In El Progreso, 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Honduran
capital of Tegucigalpa, the army evacuated more than 5,000 people
who live in low-lying banana plantations along the Ulua River, said
resident Nolly Soliman.
	   Two brothers, Misael and Rainel Juares, were electrocuted Monday
when they tried to take a television antenna down from their roof
in the village of Jutiapa, near La Ceiba.
	   Early Tuesday, the storm passed almost directly over the tiny
Islas del Cisne, Honduran islands used in the 1980s as a U.S. radar
station and radio base for broadcasts to Cuba. Authorities said the
military base lost its roof, but the five soldiers posted there
were unhurt because they took refuge in nearby caves.
	   Forecasters expect Mitch to swirl parallel to the Honduran coast
and then turn northward and head for Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and
its resorts of Cancun and Cozumel. But a strike on Belize also was
possible.
	   Belize residents weren't taking any chances. Stores and banks
were closed in Belize City and almost all the city's 75,000
residents were fleeing by car or bus to higher ground.
	   A huge traffic jam _ and a heavy rain _ slowed drivers headed to
Belmopan, the Belizean capital built after Belize City itself was
destroyed by Hurricane Hattie in 1961.
	   All gas stations in Belize City had run out of gasoline, but the
government commandeered all buses in the country to run 24 hours a
day, ferrying people inland for free.
	   The government also ordered the total evacuation of Ambergris
Cay, an island in the north of the country that is home to many
Americans and Europeans. Residents were fleeing on water taxis and
military planes, authorities said.
	   And further north in Mexico, tourists in the resorts of Cancun
and Cozumel prepared for the worst. Long lines formed at the
airport and authorities made plans to evacuate tens of thousands of
tourists if the hurricane gets closer.
	   Vacationer Allison Chapman of North Devon, England, said she had
been waiting at the airport for five hours.
	   ``We're No. 12 on the standby list _ to anywhere,'' she said.

Calls for revenge after West Bank slayings; suspects arrested
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian reaction to Cabinet &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Showing resolve to keep their part of the new
peace agreement with Israel, Palestinian security forces on Tuesday
arrested two Palestinian suspects in the grisly killing of a Jewish
settler in the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   An impromptu stone memorial set up Tuesday in the spot where
29-year-old Danny Vargas was dumped from his car by his killers a
day before bore the inscription ``avenge the blood.''
	   In a second funeral Tuesday, some 3,000 Palestinians buried an
elderly Palestinian, Mohammed Zalout, who was bludgeoned to death
near a Jewish settlement, apparently by an Israeli extremist.
	   The crowd chanted ``revenge, revenge,'' and the Israeli army
briefly declared Palestinian towns in the West Bank off-limits to
Israelis, apparently because of growing concern about revenge
attacks. The ban was lifted after several hours.
	   Despite the latest cycle of violence, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said he was determined to withdraw troops from 13 percent
of the West Bank over the next 12 weeks.
	   ``The only thing that can prevent the implementation of the
agreement is if the (Israeli) Cabinet does not approve it, or if
the Palestinians do not fulfill it,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu later postponed a Cabinet session to ratify the accord
because the Palestinians had not yet delivered a working document
on security. A statement by Netanyahu's office said the Cabinet
would convene after Israel receives the document.
	   An official for the Palestinians said he hoped the move was not
a stalling tactic.
	   ``This detailed plan is an internal Palestinian plan dealing
with security. the Israelis do not need to see it. It was agreed
upon in wye and it was kept in the safekeeping of President
Clinton, I do not understand why now this is an issue,'' said Ahmed
Tibi a spokesman for Yasser Arafat.
	   Earlier, Netanyahu was evasive when asked whether he would
freeze a withdrawal if parliament passes an early elections bill
that has been approved for a first reading by parliament.
	   Israeli media speculated Tuesday that Netanyahu might try to
discourage the dovish opposition from backing the bill by declaring
that in the event of early elections he would suspend the pullback.
	   Netanyahu said he would not relate to the possibility of spring
elections because he hoped ``it will not happen.''
	   The most vocal critics of Netanyahu have been Jewish settlers
and their representatives in parliament. At Vargas' open grave,
politicians and friends delivering eulogies demanded that Netanyahu
go back on his promise to withdraw from West Bank land.
	   ``You promised us peace and security, and we have neither,''
said legislator Rehavam Zeevi from the far-right opposition party
Moledet, referring to Netanyahu. His speech was punctuated by
shouts of ``wage war'' by some of the mourners.
	   Monday's two killings put the new peace agreement to a first
test. A centerpiece of the agreement is a pledge by the
Palestinians to work harder to rein in militants.
	   Demonstrating a new attitude, Palestinian security forces who
had suspended cooperation with Israel for most of the past 17
months on Tuesday arrested two suspects in the Vargas killing.
	   Tibi said one of the men was believed to have shot Vargas and
another to have served as an accomplice. The two men are residents
of Hebron, but Tibi did not say whether they had ties to a
Palestinian political faction.
	   The two suspects also confessed to killing a Jewish seminary
student earlier this month near the communal farm of Ora south of
Jerusalem, Tibi said.
	   Israel army radio identified the main suspect as Jamal Jadallah
and said he denied during interrogation that he had any ties to the
Islamic militant group Hamas, the main opponent to peace with
Israel.
	   Despite the new cooperation, Israeli troops reacted harshly to
the killing of the settler, clamping a curfew on the downtown area
of Hebron they control and sealing the city so Palestinians could
not leave or enter.
	   The curfew barred some 30,000 Palestinians from leaving their
homes. During the crackdown, troops entered a girls' elementary
school and ordered the students, some of them crying, to go home.
	   Since August, downtown Hebron residents have already been under
curfew twice for a total of three weeks, and the new restrictions
embittered many Palestinians.
	   ``We thought that we could now go to Gaza, but we cannot even
leave our homes,'' said Khalil Jaberi, 26, referring to a provision
in the accord for a new land route for Palestinians between the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.

	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ League champion Juventus of Turin, fielding
several reserve players and two long-missing starters, was held to
a 1-1 draw by low-ranked Venezia in a third round first leg game of
the Italian Cup Tuesday.
	   Striker Nicola Amoruso, returning to action following a 11-month
absence due to a broken leg and an ankle surgery, gave Juventus a
1-0 first-half lead heading in a perfect corner kick by Uruguayan
Daniel Fonseca in the 12th minute.
	   Defender Gianluca Luppi converted a penalty kick in the 75th
minute for Venezia's deserved draw at Turin's almost empty Delle
Alpi stadium.
	   The game, played one day before other third round matches, also
featured the comeback of veteran captain-defender Ciro Ferrara,
sidelined with a broken leg since last February.
	   Juventus was without its regular strikers Alessandro Del Piero
and Filippo Inzaghi, who were rested following last Sunday's
successful league match against Inter Milan.
	   Wednesday's matches include Lecce against league leader
Fiorentina, Inter against third-division Castel di Sangro and AS
Roma vs. Atalanta of Bergamo.
	   Defending Cup champion Lazio of Rome takes on AC Milan on
Thursday.
	   Second-leg games are scheduled on Nov. 11.

	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand's rugby sevens star and
former All Black Eric Rush has admitted his role in the death of a
23-year-old man in a car accident in August.

Calls for revenge after West Bank slayings; suspects arrested

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Showing resolve to keep their part of the new
peace agreement with Israel, Palestinian security forces on Tuesday
arrested two Palestinian suspects in the grisly killing of a Jewish
settler in the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   An impromptu stone memorial set up Tuesday in the spot where
29-year-old Danny Vargas was dumped from his car by his killers a
day before bore the inscription ``avenge the blood.''
	   In a second funeral Tuesday, some 3,000 Palestinians buried an
elderly Palestinian, Mohammed Zalout, who was bludgeoned to death
near a Jewish settlement, apparently by an Israeli extremist.
	   The crowd chanted ``revenge, revenge,'' and the Israeli army
briefly declared Palestinian towns in the West Bank off-limits to
Israelis, apparently because of growing concern about revenge
attacks. The ban was lifted after several hours.
	   Despite the latest cycle of violence, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said he was determined to withdraw troops from 13 percent
of the West Bank over the next 12 weeks.
	   ``The only thing that can prevent the implementation of the
agreement is if the (Israeli) Cabinet does not approve it, or if
the Palestinians do not fulfill it,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu later postponed a Cabinet session to ratify the accord
because the Palestinians had not yet delivered a working document
on security. A statement from Netanyahu's office said the Cabinet
would convene after Israel receives the document.
	   An official for the Palestinians said he hoped the move was not
a stalling tactic.
	   ``This detailed plan is an internal Palestinian plan dealing
with security. The Israelis do not need to see it. It was agreed
upon in Wye and it was kept in the safekeeping of President (Bill)
Clinton, I do not understand why now this is an issue,'' said Ahmed
Tibi a spokesman for Yasser Arafat.
	   Earlier, Netanyahu was evasive when asked whether he would
freeze a withdrawal if parliament passes an early elections bill
that has been approved for a first reading by parliament.
	   Israeli media speculated Tuesday that Netanyahu might try to
discourage the dovish opposition from backing the bill by declaring
that in the event of early elections he would suspend the pullback.
	   The Labor Party and its left-wing partners support the peace
agreement, but want Netanyahu out of office.
	   Netanyahu said he would not speculate on the possibility of
spring elections because he hoped they would not take place.
	   Netanyahu's most vocal critics have been Jewish settlers and
their representatives in parliament. At Vargas' open grave,
politicians and friends delivering eulogies demanded that Netanyahu
go back on his promise to withdraw from West Bank land.
	   ``You promised us peace and security, and we have neither,''
said legislator Rehavam Zeevi from the far-right opposition party
Moledet, referring to Netanyahu. His speech was punctuated by
shouts of ``wage war'' by some of the mourners.
	   Monday's two killings put the new peace agreement to its first
test. A centerpiece of the agreement is a pledge by the
Palestinians to work harder to rein in militants.
	   Demonstrating a new attitude, Palestinian security forces who
had suspended cooperation with Israel for most of the past 17
months on Tuesday arrested two suspects in the Vargas killing.
	   Tibi said one of the men was believed to have shot Vargas and
another to have served as an accomplice. The two men are residents
of Hebron, but Tibi did not say whether they had ties to a
Palestinian political faction.
	   The two suspects also confessed to killing a Jewish seminary
student earlier this month near the communal farm of Ora south of
Jerusalem, Tibi said.
	   Israel army radio identified the main suspect as Jamal Jadallah
and said he denied during interrogation that he had any ties to the
Islamic militant group Hamas, the main opponent to peace with
Israel.
	   Despite the new cooperation, Israeli troops reacted harshly to

of Hebron they control and sealing the city so Palestinians could
not leave or enter.
	   The curfew barred some 30,000 Palestinians from leaving their

school and ordered the students, some of them crying, to go home.
	   Since August, downtown Hebron residents have already been under
curfew twice for a total of three weeks, and the new restrictions
embittered many Palestinians.
	   ``We thought that we could now go to Gaza, but we cannot even
leave our homes,'' said Khalil Jaberi, 26, referring to a provision

West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Woods, Duval shoot for lowest scoring average
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ While David Duval has all but wrapped up the
money title, the battle for the lowest scoring average on tour
could come down to the last hole at East Lake Golf Club this week
in the dlrs 4 million Tour Championship.
	   Duval, a four-time winner on tour this year, had a 3-over-par 75
in the final round of the Disney Classic last week, which allowed
Tiger Woods to regain the lead. Woods had a 70 on Sunday and
finished six strokes ahead of Duval.
	   Last week, Duval had a 69.02 average to 69.06 for Woods. Going
into the Tour Championship, Woods is back in the lead at 69.10,
compared to 69.14 for Duval.
	   Woods, who has won just once on tour this year, was asked which
was more important _ the money title or the scoring average.
	   ``Scoring average, by far,'' he said. ``The money title is based
upon what you do in certain tournaments; certain purses are better
than others. I think a true measure of a player, how good he is
playing for an entire year, is stroke average.''
	   Although scores are adjusted at every tournament based on field
performance, it appears Duval would have to finish four strokes
ahead of Woods to win the Byron Nelson Award for lowest scoring
average.
	   If Duval can pull it off, it would be only the fifth time since
1981 that a player has won the money title and the scoring average
in the same year. The others were Tom Lehman (1996), Greg Norman
(1990, 1995), Fred Couples (1992) and Tom Kite (1981).
	   That assumes that Duval wins the money title, which at this
point looks like a lock. The only player with a chance to catch him
is Jim Furyk, who would have to win the Tour Championship and hope
that Duval finishes 25th or worse in the 30-man field.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; PENNEY PAIR: &LR;  Here's more evidence that the mixed-team JCPenney
Classic in December is in the heart of silly season: Annika
Sorenstam has agreed to play, but only if her husband, David Esch,
can be her partner.
	   ``I'd rather play and have a good time than just pick someone
and compete,'' Sorenstam said. ``He's a scratch golfer. It might be
a test for our marriage, but this is a super opportunity for me and
David.''
	   Not everyone feels that way.
	   The JCPenney team consists of a PGA and LPGA player, and some
feel Esch _ who is turning pro for the event _ is taking away a
sponsor's exemption from another player. Sorenstam wanted to play
with fellow Swede Jesper Parnevik, but he'll be in the Million
Dollar Challenge in South Africa that week.
	   ``I think it's a mistake because he's not a real pro,'' Dottie
Pepper said. ``Those exemptions were made for pros.''
	   ``I don't think it's right,'' Tom Purtzer said, ``but it's not
my call.''
	   Tournament director Gerald Goodman said he and IMG officials
tried to find a partner for Sorenstam, but finally relented.
	   ``We're in a position to have the greatest woman's player in the
world,'' he said. ``This is a Presidents Cup year and she tried to
secure a top-ranked player. But she still wanted to come to the
tournament.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; ACES UPDATE: &LR;  The aces keep piling up for Bradley Farmer.
	   The 15-year-old from Madison, Tennessee, who recorded six of
them in a span of 41 days this summer, got into the groove again
last week. He got yet another hole-in-one on the 135-yard
(123-meter) third hole at The Hermitage with a 9-iron on Oct. 22.
	   Turns out, he was just warming up.
	   ``He got two more in the same round the next day,'' said his
father, Roger Farmer. ``It was pretty bizarre.''
	   Farmer used a 5-iron from 185 yards (168 meters) on No. 3 at
Pine Creek, and an 8-iron from 145 yards (132 meters) on the 12th
hole. Troy Fairley, the head pro at Pine Creek, confirmed the aces.
	   ``He hits the ball pretty straight,'' Fairley said.
	   That gives Farmer nine aces in 73 days. His two at Pine Creek
helped him shoot a 64, although it wasn't enough to break his
course record of 61.
	   Said Bradley: ``I missed a few putts early.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DOWN TO HIS LAST CHIP: &LR;  The final tally on Chip Beck's season
isn't pretty. He played in 28 tournaments, made two cuts and earned
dlrs 10,866, for an average of dlrs 388.07 per start. Beck finished
271st on the money list.
	   Beck, a four-time winner and the last player to shoot 59 on the
PGA Tour, has one last chance to turn around his fortunes.
	   He was exempt this year for being in the top 25 on the career
money list. Now he can use his one-time exemption for being in the
top 50.
	   Three players used their top-50 exemption for 1998 and survived
_Fuzzy Zoeller finished 101st on the money list, Scott Simpson won
for a two-year exemption and John Huston won twice, including the
Disney Classic on Sunday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; PRESIDENTIAL FALLOUT: &LR;  The Presidents Cup has its first
casualty. Jumbo Ozaki, who ranks fourth in standings for the
International team, has told captain Peter Thomson that he won't be
playing.
	   Thomson told the Melbourne Age it was both a ``shame'' and a
``disappointment.''
	   The reasons for Ozaki, 51, backing out could be related to his
golf equipment business, which is struggling along with the rest of
the Asian economy. And he has never been a big fan of international
travel.
	   Of his 105 victories, only one _ the New Zealand PGA
Championship in 1972 _ came outside Japan. He did play in the 1996
Presidents Cup in Virginia, but only after a serious plea from
Thomson. He was 1-2-0 in his matches, but later said he never felt
like an integral part of the team since most players were 20 years
younger.

Arafat's Fatah group enforces strike in West Bank towns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout details from military tribunal, four men
sentenced, comment from police commander and Arafat returning
Wednesday &QL; 
 &UR; By MOHAMMED DARAGMEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ In a show of force, Yasser Arafat's
Fatah faction shut down several West Bank towns Tuesday to push for
the trial and execution of Palestinian intelligence agents who
killed a young Fatah activist in a clash this week.
	   In the West Bank town of Nablus, hundreds of Fatah activists
filled the streets and burned tires. Several marchers fired their
weapons in the air.
	   Fatah also enforced strikes in the towns of Bethlehem, Tulkarem
and in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. Shops were shuttered and
students were told to leave their schools.
	   The dispute began Sunday when members of the Palestinian
military intelligence raided the Fatah headquarters in the town of
Ramallah and seized weapons and files. A Fatah activist,
16-year-old Wassim Tarifi, was shot to death by intelligence agents
during subsequent rock-throwing protests.
	   Fatah leaders want Tarifi's killers to be tried and executed.
They also seek the ouster of the head of military intelligence,
Moussa Arafat, a distant relative of the Palestinian leader.
	   At a press conference in Ramallah, Arafat said he would not
resign unless asked to by the Palestinian leader. He said he
ordered his men into the Fatah office not in search for weapons but
to find several fugitives.
	   He denied members of his force fired the bullet that killed
Tarifi and blamed the death on shots fired from the crowd.
	   ``There were no orders given to members of the military
intelligence to open fire at the protesters,'' he said. Several men
from his force were being detained and questioned in the shooting.
	   Despite following their commander's orders, the four officers
who entered the Fatah building were sentenced during a
court-martial in Jericho on charges of violating the sanctity of
the Fatah office and harming national unity. Three of the officers
were sentenced to three years in jail each, while the most senior
officer was sentenced to four years in jail.
	   Yasser Arafat is abroad and was to return later Wednesday. He
needs Fatah's support to shape public opinion and is expected to
move quickly to quell the growing rebellion of his loyalists.
	   A senior Arafat aide, Tayeb Abdel Rahim, said that Arafat has
already ordered the establishment of a special military tribunal
that would investigate the case and try the suspected shooters.
However, no one has been arrested yet in Tarifi's death.
	   In a similar case in August, Arafat complied with Fatah demands
and ordered the execution of two Palestinian policemen who had
killed two of the group's activists in a personal feud.

Caseload outstripping funds at International Court of Justice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Caseloads are outstripping money at the
International Court of Justice to the extent that justice could be
jeopardized, the court president told the General Assembly on
Tuesday.
	   ``If the court is to fulfill its potential as the organization's
principal judicial organ, then it must be afforded the resources to
work as intensively and expeditiously as burgeoning international
recourse to it demands,'' Judge Stephen M. Schwebel told the
assembly in presenting the court's annual report.
	   Despite a substantial increase in the number of cases being
handled by the court, its dlrs 11 million budget is a smaller
percentage of the U.N. budget than in 1946, when the court was
established, he said.
	   As a result, there is a backlog of cases that is only expected
to worsen as nations continue to acquire a ``law habit,'' that
leads them to submit more and more disputes to the court, he said.
	   ``It is trite but true to say that justice delayed may be
justice denied,'' he said.
	   The court, which sits at The Hague, Netherlands, tries cases
brought by nations against other nations. It has no enforcement
powers and has to rely on voluntary compliance with its rulings.
	   It differs from the ad hoc tribunal also at the Hague, which was
set up to prosecute war crimes stemming from the conflict in the
former Yugoslavia.
	   And it differs from the international war crimes tribunal, which
will try individuals accused of war crimes, genocide, crimes
against humanity and aggression when it is established. A treaty
creating the tribunal was approved in July.

NATO maintains airstrike threat, no new deadline

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies decided Tuesday to keep
up the threat of air strikes against Serb forces for an unspecified
period, despite recognizing a substantial withdrawal of troops and
police from Kosovo.
	   A meeting of ambassadors from the 16-allied nations agreed to
indefinitely extend the ``activation order,'' which is keeping more
than 400 allied warplanes on alert for possible raids against the
Serbs.
	   ``We have requested our military authorities to remain prepared
to carry out these air operations ... and to maintain forces at
appropriate readiness levels,'' said NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana.
	   But the alliance did not set a new deadline for the airstrikes
after the previous deadline of 1900 GMT expired.
	   Solana said the decision would maintain pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic at a time when his troops were moving
to comply with the alliance's demand that reinforcements sent to
Kosovo during the eight-month crisis be withdrawn.
	   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' Solana said at a
news conference after the 2 1/2 meeting.
	   Hundreds of people have died and nearly 300,000 have been driven
from their homes in fighting since Milosevic sent in troops to
battle ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and
most want independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The NATO alliance had threatened to launch airstrikes unless
Milosevic halted his crackdown and cut his forces to levels in
place before the conflict began.
	   Solana said reports from observers on the ground and
reconnaissance flights by unarmed NATO planes showed most Yugoslav
army and special police units had withdrawn from Kosovo or returned
to barracks.
	   ``The security forces are returning to the level they were at
before the present crisis began,'' he said, adding some 10,000 army
troops and special police forces remained in Kosovo.
	   The allies also issued a statement calling on ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo to comply with U.N. resolutions and ``maintain the
cease-fire they have declared.''
	   Solana said NATO ambassadors would keep the situation under
constant review. ``If we see evidence of substantial noncompliance
in the future ... we will be ready to use force,'' he said.
	   However, under Tuesday's decision NATO's top military commander
in Europe, U.S. General Wesley Clark, will need authorization from
the NATO governments before he can go ahead with air strikes.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said the withdrawal
of sizable Serb military and police units from Kosovo was ``a
hopeful moment'' for the troubled province but not a guarantee of a
peaceful settlement with ethnic Albanians.
	   Responding to NATO's decision to hold its fire, Clinton stressed
NATO retains the authority to attack the Serbs if Milosevic
reverses the withdrawals.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, meanwhile, said the
NATO allies were preparing to assemble a rapid-reaction force in
the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia to be ready to intervene
if Milosevic sends troops against civilians again.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ian McEwan won the prestigious Booker Prize for
fiction on Tuesday for his novel, ``Amsterdam.''
	   McEwan, 50, won the 21,000 pound (dlrs 35,000) prize at the 1998
awards ceremony in London's Guildhall.
	   ``Amsterdam'' tells the story of two men embroiled in scandal
when the lover of both is photographed in compromising positions
with the foreign secretary.
	   ``I feel as if I'm in a dream as I'm sure all winners before me
have felt too,'' the author said as he recevied his award from
former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
	   McEwan previously was nominated for ``The Comfort of
Strangers,'' in 1981, and ``Black Dogs,'' (in 1992. Other highly
praised novels were ``The Child in Time,'' ``The Innocent'' and
last year's ``Enduring Love,'' a story of obsessive stalking
following a ballooning accident.
	   A Booker Prize can more than double hardback sales and has
greatly boosted library readership of winning books.
	   The prize, established in 1968, is bestowed each year on the
best novel written in English in Britain or Commonwealth nations.
	   The bookmakers' favorite to win had been Beryl Bainbridge's
``Master Georgie,'' set in the Crimean War. Bainbridge has been
nominated five times for the Booker.
	   Other nominees were Julian Barnes' satire ``England, England;''
Patrick McCabe's ``Breakfast On Pluto,'' about an Irish
transvestive during the 1970s Northern Ireland troubles; ``The
Restraint of Beasts,'' the debut novel of bus driver Magnus Mills,
about two Scots fence builders, and Martin Booth's ``The Industry
Of Souls.'' about a man imprisoned as a spy for 20 years in a
Soviet labor camp.

	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ The Calgary Flames traded dealt
defenseman Jamie Allison, center Erik Andersson and wing Marty
McInnis to the Chicago Blackhawks on Tuesday in an effort to cut
their payroll.
	   The Flames received centers Jeff Shantz and Steve Dubinsky from
the Blackhawks, who subsequently dealt McInnis to the Anaheim
Mighty Ducks for an undisclosed future draft pick.
	   ``We have addressed a team need at center,'' Calgary GM Al
Coates said. ``Both players (Shantz and Dubinsky) are NHL regulars
who can play either center, their natural position, or the wing.
	   ``Obviously we feel this strengthens us at a critical area in
our team composition.''
	   The Flames save some salary in the deal. McInnis makes dlrs 1.1
million this season, Andersson dlrs 550,000 and Allison dlrs
500,000. Shantz makes dlrs 725,000 and Dubinsky dlrs 575,000.

Jordanian soldiers buried near Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Four Jordanian soldiers who died in the 1967
Mideast war were finally given a full military burial Tuesday, on
the battlefield where they died near Jerusalem.
	   The soldiers died during intense fighting in Nabi Samuel, a town
north of Jerusalem whose view of the contested city made it
strategically critical during the war in which Israel captured
Jerusalem from the Jordanians.
	   The soldiers' remains were discovered three years ago, during an
archaeological dig in the area. Family members said they agreed to
requests from Jordanian officials to bury the soldiers where they
had been found because it is an honor to be buried near Jerusalem,
Israel TV reported.
	   On Tuesday, Jordanian soldiers dressed in khaki uniforms and
red-checkered kaffiyahs draped wooden coffins with Jordanian flags
and lowered the caskets into the ground as military trumpets
blared.
	   Eldad Evitar, a former commander who led Israeli troops in the
area during the war, praised the courage of his Jordanian
counterparts.
	   ``In war, we are each other's enemies. In peace, we are friends
and colleagues,'' Evitar told Israel TV.
	   The Jordanian ambassador to Israel and several Jordanian
lawmakers also attended the funeral in what was once enemy
territory. In 1994, Jordan signed a peace treaty that ended 46
years of hostile relations between the countries.

Luton upsets Dublin-less Coventry; Forest loses 3-0 lead against
</HEADLINE>
Cambridge but goes through on penalties &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Division Two Luton ousted Premier League Coventry
City from the League Cup on a 2-0 upset scoreline Tuesday while
division three Cambridge United produced a comeback from 3-0 down
at Nottingham Forest before losing in a penalty shootout.
	   With England striker Dion Dublin talking over a 6 million pound
(dlrs 10 million) transfer to Blackburn, struggling Coventry
tumbled at Kenilworth Road without him.
	   Phil Gray fired Luton ahead early in the second half and it was
2-0 when Graham Alexander's corner was headed home by Steve Davies.
	   Luton had knocked out division one Oxford and Ipswich on the way
to the third round and the result poured more misery on Coventry
which second from last in the Premier League standings.
	   At the City Ground, goals by Dougie Freedman, Craig Armstrong
and Marlon Harewood put Forest 3-0 ahead a minute into the second
half. Trevor Benjamin and Martin Butler pulled it back to 3-2 and
John Taylor's penalty six minutes from the end after French
defender Thierry Bonolaire had handled, meant Cambridge took the
match to extra time in front of Forest's horrified fans.
	   The Premier League team, down to 10 players after Bonolaire's
expulsion, held on to take the match to penalties and advanced 4-3
in the shootout.
	   In other third round matches, Liverpool downed Kevin Keegan's
Fulham 3-1 and Tottenham gained a 3-1 win at another division two
club, Northampton.
	   Fulham held Liverpool scoreless at half time but fell behind to
a deflected David Thompson shot. Paul Peschisolido's curling shot
past Liverpool's United States international goalkeeper Brad
Friedel made it 1-1 but Robbie Fowler fired in a penalty after
Michael Owen had been brought down and Paul Ince headed home Steve
Staunton's cross.
	   Tottenham fell a goal down at division two Northampton through
Sean Parrish. But Chris Armstrong hit two goals and Sol Campbell
added another and Spurs' French international star David Ginola
even had a penalty saved.
	   Two goals by Tony Cottee fired visiting Leicester into the last
16 in a 2-1 win at Charlton who replied through Paul Mortimer.
	   Paul Dalglish, son of former Newcastle manager Kenny, fired the
only goal as Newcastle won 1-0 at division one Tranmere.
	   St. Johnstone set up a Nov. 29 Scottish League Cup final against
Rangers by scoring a 3-0 victory over Hearts at Easter Road. Goals
by Nick Dasovic, Allan Preston and George O'Boyle meant St.
Johnstone gained its first cup final for 29 years.
	   Rangers crushed division one Airdrie 5-0 on Sunday.

Taylor enters drug rehab again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Lawrence Taylor is back in drug rehabilitation,
hoping to beat a cocaine habit, avoid prison and protect his
standing for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
	   Taylor, a star linebacker with the New York Giants from 1981-93,
returned to a rehab center in the New York area on Monday and is
expected to be there for 30 to 60 days.
	   That would bring him close to the deadline for nominations for
this year's Hall of Fame class. Taylor becomes eligible in 1999.
	   ``The fact he's going into rehab shows he is trying to do
something beneficial for himself,'' said his lawyer, Thomas Melani.
``It's a two-pronged effort, the main thrust being with all the
publicity and stress he can get some reinforcement.
	   ``He's eligible for the Hall of Fame, which is the next big step
for him, and he is trying to get over this latest hurdle and to
make sure it does not affect his eligibility.''
	   The 39-year-old retired linebacker was arrested last week in
Florida on crack-cocaine charges for the second time in three
years. He contends he was set up by police in this latest case, and
Melani said Taylor passed a polygraph test on Saturday.
	   Melani said the former New York Giants star could face prison
time if he didn't seek immediate drug counseling. This arrest could
violate a plea agreement he made last year after Taylor pleaded
guilty to filing a false federal income tax return for not
including dlrs 48,000 in income from a now-closed restaurant near
Giants Stadium.
	   ``With the legalities of him awaiting sentencing on the federal
situation with the Internal Revenue Service, his arrest could be
considered a violation of his probation,'' Melani said. ``The fact
he is going into rehab shows he is trying to do something
beneficial for himself.''
	   The maximum penalty facing Taylor was three years in prison and
a dlrs 250,000 fine, but he was expected to receive probation
because he cooperated with federal prosecutors.
	   Taylor has been in drug rehab several times, both while a player
and after his retirement. His All-Pro career was marred by an NFL
suspension for violating the league's drug abuse policy.
	   Several members of the committee that votes for the Hall of Fame
admitted they would have second thoughts about voting for Taylor.
Others noted his on-field performance should be the only criteria.
	   Giants co-owner Wellington Mara said Tuesday the team helped
Taylor re-enter rehab.
	   ``It is our policy to help our former players when we can,''
Mara said.
	   Jets coach Bill Parcells, who coached Taylor with the Giants and
said last week about him, ``I love the guy,'' also called the
Giants to see if he could help.
	   Taylor's latest arrest was on Oct. 19 in a St. Pete Beach,
Florida motel room where police said he tried to buy dlrs 50 worth
of crack cocaine from an undercover officer. According to police,
15 crack pipes were inside the room.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ When a love affair goes sour, some destroy the
evidence. Others save everything: goofy postcards, tiny drawings on
matchbooks, a doodle on a restaurant menu.
	   Luckily, Dora Maar, muse to Pablo Picasso for eight stormy
years, kept all those things and more _ from grand oil paintings to
a paper scrap with her lover's bloodstain.
	   On Tuesday, 15 months after Maar's lonely death, art-lovers got
a chance to buy a piece of that passionate treasure trove.
	   The three-day auction _ said to be the largest Picasso
collection to go on the block _ is expected to bring in anything
from dlrs 30 million to dlrs 70 million. The first evening,
focusing on oil paintings and drawings, saw sky-high prices for
drawings but lower than expected prices for some of the paintings.
	   But it is the deeply personal, slice-of-life nature of the
collection that had Parisians standing in the rain to get a
pre-auction glimpse at the Maison de la Chimie near the Eiffel
Tower.
	   Dora Maar was 29, the dark-haired daughter of a Yugoslav
architect and a French mother, when she met Picasso in 1936. She
quickly became his lover and also a model, particularly for
``Guernica.''
	   But in the 1940s, Picasso moved on to the younger Francoise
Gilot, and Maar went into a tailspin, living a hermetic existence
in her apartment on the Rue de Savoie, never even seeing her close
friends.
	   She died in solitude in July 1997 at age 89. She had never
married, had no heirs, and had only a 1958 will naming three monks
who died before she did, museum officials say.
	   But genealogists tracked down two distant relatives, both of
whom had never even heard of Maar. Now, after 60 percent of the
proceeds go to the government for taxes, they'll get much of the
remaining 40 percent.
	   Many of Maar's friends aren't happy.
	   ``Dora would be just horrified at all this,'' said James Lord,
one of her close friends in Paris, though in the last few years
they only exchanged letters.
	   ``All this stuff was so personal to her,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``It's rather morbid to have it up for sale.''
	   Picasso's granddaughter, Diana Widmaier, agreed.
	   ``Some of these private things should never have gone on the
market,'' she said after the auction's first session. ``And our
family was informed too late.''
	   The French government has deemed some of the works _ like a set
of whimsical paper cut-outs made for Picasso's daughter, Maya,
including animal heads with cigarette holes for eyes _ a
``collection,'' meaning they can't be taken from France.
	   The big ticket-items were 10 oil paintings, including seven of
Dora herself. The highest price, 37 million francs (dlrs 6,642,729)
went for the 1937 ``The Crying Woman (Study for Guernica)'' _ in
which Dora's eyes are turned into tears pierced with long pins.
	   But the favorite of many, ``Dora Maar with Green Nails,''
fetched a disappointing 23 million francs (dlrs 4,129,264.) The
1936 tableau shows the muse at the height of her style, her chin
resting on green-painted nails and hair braided on top of her head.
	   The evening's big success was the drawings, especially ``Dora
with Unmade Hair,'' which went for 5 million francs (dlrs 897,666).
	   But the most fascinating objects, to go on sale later this week,
are the smallest: little portraits of Dora made into jewelry;
little instruments made from the silver wrapping around a wine
cork; dozens of sketches on tiny matchbook covers; photographs of
the dashing Picasso at all ages; original books, notes, postcards,
and letters.
	   Nothing, it seems, was too small or insignificant for Picasso to
scrawl on. One matchbook says: ``It was so dark at noon that the
stars could be seen.'' A restaurant menu is adorned with a
whimsical self-portrait of the artist.
	   And perhaps the oddest but most poignant item from this lover's
cache: a scrap of paper with a brownish stain, and the scrawled
words, ``Blood of Picasso.''

Becker delights the home crowd once again

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Boris Becker began what could possibly
be his last tournament at home with a 6-2, 7-5 victory over Sjeng
Schalken at the dlrs 2.45 million Eurocard Open on Tuesday.
	   Becker, 30, is in semi-retirement and this is only his 10th
tournament of the year. The three-time Wimbledon champion suffered
an ankle injury and had not played between July and the Basel
tournament three weeks ago, where he lost in the first round.
	   ``I was very glad to be back on the tennis court,'' Becker said.
``I've played one tennis match in three months and I was able to
put it away in two sets, I was very pleased with that.''
	   In the last match of the day, ninth-seeded Tim Henman beat Mark
Woodforde 7-5, 6-1, firing an ace on his first match point. Henman
is in the running for the two last available spots in the eight-man
World Championship next month in Hanover, Germany.
	   Todd Martin upset eight-ranked Karol Kucera 6-2, 6-4, a defeat
that could spoil Kucera's hopes of qualifying for Hanover.
	   Henman and Martin both advanced to the third round.
	   Becker's last victory on the tour was also in Stuttgart, when he
beat Felix Mantilla in the third round of the outdoor clay-court
event, before losing to Marcelo Rios in July.
	   The presence of Becker still guarantees a big crowd in Germany
and more than 6,000 fans joined in a loud celebration after he used
his seventh match point to dispatch Schalken, a Dutch qualifier.
Becker was born in Leimen, not far from Stuttgart.
	   ``It gives me great satisfaction to be able to do what I really
love,'' Becker said. ``I hope I can do it a few more times. I am
very glad to be able to still come back and play decent tennis.''
	   Becker, who is also Germany's Davis Cup team chief, now plays
only selected tournaments and his plans for next year are unclear,
although the veteran sounded like he might continue playing some
events.
	   If the ankle injury had not healed quickly, Becker said, ``I
don't think I was going to be back next year.''
	   ``I wanted to play more indoors but it was very difficult to
come back and actually play again because the muscles didn't work,
the ankle hurt,'' he said. Another major injury would probably mean
the end of his career, said Becker, who plans to play in Paris and
Stockholm in the next two weeks.
	   Becker, who has won the Stuttgart tournament twice, will play
French Open champion Carlos Moya in the second round. He is also
playing doubles here with Andre Agassi.
	   Becker's Davis Cup team also had a winning day.
	   Tommy Haas beat David Nainkin of South Africa, a ``lucky loser''
from the qualifying round, 6-4, 6-4, and Nicolas Kiefer defeated
Byron Black 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-0).
	   Kiefer, who rallied from a 5-1 deficit in the third set and
saved five match points, will play top-ranked Pete Sampras in the
second round.
	   Albert Costa, the 16th-ranked Spaniard who has never won an
indoor match in his career, stayed true to form by losing 6-2, 6-2
to Bohdan Ulihrach.

Colombian Alpinist missing on Mt. Manaslu, presumed dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details from Colombian team.

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ In two days of searching, a group of
international mountaineers failed to find a Colombian colleague
swept away by an avalanche on the 8,163-meter (26,940-foot) Mt.
Manaslu, the man's colleagues said.
	   Five members of a Colombian expedition were descending from camp
two at 6,300 meters to camp one at 5,900 meters in waist-deep snow
on Sunday when an avalanche of hard snow broke them free of their
fixed rope line, the Colombian team said in a statement faxed from
their base camp.
	   Lost and presumed dead was Lenin Granados, 31, of Bogota,
Colombia, who was leading the descent, according to the statement.
The four others managed to escape.
	   Bulgarian, Mexican, Colombian and Nepalese climbers on the
mountain tried in vain for two days to find Granados, an industrial
engineer, according to the fax received Tuesday in the Colombian
capital. The team sent its condolences to Granados' family.
	   A snowstorm and strong winds had prompted the Colombian team to
abandon its assault on the summit and begin the descent on Sunday.
	   The Colombian team said seven groups had attempted to reach Mt.
Manaslu's summit during the present autumn mountaineering season,
which ends Nov. 15. It did not say whether any succeeded.

Oil paintings to doodles: legacy of an affair with Picasso
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ When a love affair goes sour, some destroy the
evidence. Others save everything: goofy postcards, tiny drawings on
matchbooks, a doodle on a restaurant menu.
	   Luckily, Dora Maar, muse to Pablo Picasso for eight stormy
years, kept all those things and more _ from grand oil paintings to
a paper scrap with her lover's bloodstain.
	   On Tuesday, 15 months after Maar's lonely death, art-lovers got
a chance to buy a piece of that passionate treasure trove.
	   The three-day auction _ said to be the largest Picasso
collection to go on the block _ is expected to bring in up to dlrs
70 million. The first evening, focusing on oil paintings and
drawings, saw sky-high prices for drawings but lower than expected
prices for some of the paintings.
	   But it is the deeply personal, slice-of-life nature of the
collection that had Parisians standing in the rain to get a
pre-auction glimpse at the Maison de la Chimie near the Eiffel
Tower.
	   Dora Maar was 29, the dark-haired daughter of a Yugoslav
architect and a French mother, when she met Picasso in 1936. She
quickly became his lover and also a model, particularly for
``Guernica.''
	   But in the 1940s, Picasso moved on to the younger Francoise
Gilot, and Maar went into a tailspin, living a hermetic existence
in her apartment on the Rue de Savoie, never even seeing her close
friends.
	   She died in solitude in July 1997 at age 89. She had never
married, had no heirs, and had only a 1958 will naming three monks
who died before she did, museum officials say.
	   But genealogists tracked down two distant relatives, both of
whom had never even heard of Maar. Now, after 60 percent of the
proceeds go to the government for taxes, they'll get much of the
remaining 40 percent.
	   Many of Maar's friends aren't happy.
	   ``Dora would be just horrified at all this,'' said James Lord,
one of her close friends in Paris, though in the last few years
they only exchanged letters.
	   ``All this stuff was so personal to her,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``It's rather morbid to have it up for sale.''
	   Picasso's granddaughter, Diana Widmaier, agreed.
	   ``Some of these private things should never have gone on the
market,'' she said after the auction's first session. ``And our
family was informed too late.''
	   The French government has deemed some of the works _ like a set
of whimsical paper cut-outs made for Picasso's daughter, Maya,
including animal heads with cigarette holes for eyes _ a
``collection,'' meaning they can't be taken from France.
	   The big ticket-items were 10 oil paintings, including seven of
Dora herself. The highest price, 37 million francs (dlrs 6,642,729)
went for the 1937 ``The Crying Woman (Study for Guernica)'' _ in
which Dora's eyes are turned into tears pierced with long pins.
	   Yet the favorite of many, ``Dora Maar with Green Nails,''
fetched a disappointing 23 million francs (dlrs 4,129,264.) The
1936 tableau shows the muse at the height of her style, her chin
resting on green-painted nails and hair braided on top of her head.
	   The evening's big success was the drawings, especially ``Dora
with Undone Hair,'' which went for 5 million francs (dlrs 897,666).
	   But the most fascinating objects, to go on sale later this week,
are the smallest: little portraits of Dora made into jewelry;
little instruments made from the silver wrapping around a wine
cork; dozens of sketches on tiny matchbook covers; photographs of
the dashing Picasso at all ages; original books, notes, postcards,
and letters.
	   Nothing, it seems, was too small or insignificant for Picasso to
scrawl on. One matchbook says: ``It was so dark at noon that the
stars could be seen.'' A restaurant menu is adorned with a
whimsical self-portrait of the artist.
	   And perhaps the oddest but most poignant item from this lover's
cache: a scrap of paper with a brownish stain, and the scrawled
words, ``Blood of Picasso.''

Writer Ian McEwan wins Booker Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of transvestite in graf 9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ian McEwan won the prestigious Booker Prize for
fiction on Tuesday for his novel, ``Amsterdam.''
	   McEwan, 50, won the 21,000 pound (dlrs 35,000) prize at the 1998
awards ceremony in London's Guildhall.
	   ``Amsterdam'' tells the story of two men embroiled in scandal
when the lover of both is photographed in compromising positions
with the foreign secretary.
	   ``I feel as if I'm in a dream as I'm sure all winners before me
have felt too,'' the author said as he recevied his award from
former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
	   McEwan previously was nominated for ``The Comfort of
Strangers,'' in 1981, and ``Black Dogs,'' (in 1992. Other highly
praised novels were ``The Child in Time,'' ``The Innocent'' and
last year's ``Enduring Love,'' a story of obsessive stalking
following a ballooning accident.
	   A Booker Prize can more than double hardback sales and has
greatly boosted library readership of winning books.
	   The prize, established in 1968, is bestowed each year on the
best novel written in English in Britain or Commonwealth nations.
	   The bookmakers' favorite to win had been Beryl Bainbridge's
``Master Georgie,'' set in the Crimean War. Bainbridge has been
nominated five times for the Booker.
	   Other nominees were Julian Barnes' satire ``England, England;''
Patrick McCabe's ``Breakfast On Pluto,'' about an Irish
transvestite during the 1970s Northern Ireland troubles; ``The
Restraint of Beasts,'' the debut novel of bus driver Magnus Mills,
about two Scots fence builders, and Martin Booth's ``The Industry
Of Souls.'' about a man imprisoned as a spy for 20 years in a
Soviet labor camp.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch cut through the
western Caribbean on Tuesday, pummeling coastal Honduras and Belize
with driving rain and fierce winds that snapped trees and sent
thousands of people fleeing for higher ground. Ten storm-related
deaths were reported.
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse declared the highest
state of alert and sent in troops to evacuate thousands of people
from villages on the sparsely populated coast. Thousands more made
their way to safer ground on their own.
	   Most of the population of Belize City fled inland in cars and
government buses, while tourists rushed to find ways out of the
Mexican resorts of Cancun and Cozumel, where the storm is expected
to hit by the end of the week.
	   At 2100 GMT, Mitch was about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of
Honduras and moving west-southwest _ roughly parallel to the coast
_ at 6 mph (10 kph). Its winds dropped from 180 mph (290 kph) to
near 155 mph (250 kph), reducing Mitch to a Category 4 hurricane,
one category below the most powerful. But the 350-mile
(600-kilometer) -wide storm remained very powerful _ and dangerous.
	   Mitch's slow speed made the hurricane's path especially
unpredictable, forecasters said.
	   Earlier in the day, when Mitch's winds were at 180 mph (290 kph)
_ a Category 5 storm _ the U.S. National Weather Service said only
three Atlantic storms were stronger _ Gilbert in 1988, Allen in
1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.
	   Strong winds bent palm trees along the Honduran coast Tuesday,
and heavy rain caused at least four rivers to overflow their banks.
The entire coast of Honduras was under a hurricane warning, and up
to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain was forecast in mountainous
areas.
	   In La Ceiba, on the western Honduran coast, residents fled to
shelters set up in schools and fire stations on higher ground. The
area has the sea to the north, the Cangrejal River to the east and
a creek to the west.
	   Fisherman Manuel Padilla said he wanted to evacuate with his
three children but authorities had not told him where the shelters
were located.
	   ``Nobody has come to see us,'' he complained. ``They've
forgotten us.''
	   Still, hundreds of people waded through knee-deep waters to
safety. At one fire station shelter, about 150 people huddled in
the damp, with no dry blankets or other protection. Some brought
pets, including five parrots.
	   Blanca Almeida Ramirez, 22, said she and her three children fled
early Tuesday when water began to seep into her wooden house. ``The
wood is all rotten inside,'' she said. ``I couldn't stay any
longer.''
	   The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco,
said 5,000 soldiers were deployed to help victims of the storm.
	   Five villages in the northeastern province of Gracias a Dios
were cut off by flooding, but police evacuated all 2,000 residents
before the rivers rose, said national police chief Col. Anael
Perez. Two other villages were cut off by fallen trees.
	   In El Progreso, 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Honduran
capital of Tegucigalpa, the army evacuated more than 5,000 people
who live in low-lying banana plantations along the Ulua River, said
resident Nolly Soliman.
	   Two brothers, Misael and Rainel Juares, were electrocuted Monday
when they tried to take a television antenna down from their roof
in the village of Jutiapa, near La Ceiba.
	   Nicaragua's Red Cross said at least eight people had died in
flooding caused by outer bands of the storm.
	   Early Tuesday, the storm passed almost directly over the tiny
Swan Islands, Honduran outposts used in the 1980s as a U.S. radar
station and radio base for broadcasts to Cuba. Authorities said the
military base lost its roof, but the five soldiers posted there
were unhurt because they took refuge in nearby caves.
	   Forecasters said the most likely track would carry the storm
into central Belize by early Thursday, though some models showed it
could veer southwest, northwest or even northeast if it slows
further.
	   ``It's moving slowly and the slower-moving the storm, the more
unpredictable it always is,'' said meteorologist Jack Beven at the
U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.

	   LONDON (AP) _ British-Chilean relations deteriorated further
Tuesday as Britain advised its citizens to avoid ``non-essential''
travel to Chile, saying anti-British feeling is running high since
former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet was arrested in
London.
	   Earlier, two Chilean admirals called off a trip to buy British
warships to protest Pinochet's detention Oct. 16 on a Spanish
warrant alleging he was responsible for murders, torture and
kidnappings during his 17-year rule.
	   Chilean Deputy Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez, in London
seeking Pinochet's release, said the Foreign Office warning was
``not the best way to avoid the political escalation of this
situation.''
	   Such a recommendation from the Foreign Office, he told a news
conference, was ``giving the way for the interpretation that you
are facing almost a political conflict. This is not our view.''
	   Adding to the growing claims against Pinochet, four Chilean
exiles who say they were tortured by his secret police launched a
legal bid to have him tried in Britain.
	   In a High Court hearing on Pinochet's application for immediate
release, lawyers wound up 1 1/2 days of complex legal argument,
with a ruling expected Wednesday afternoon.
	   Lawyers representing Spanish prosecutors argued that under
international law, Pinochet is liable to stand trial for human
rights abuses committed while he was in office.
	   Abuses committed by a ruler are not ``something that is in the
furtherance of his function as head of state,'' said lawyer Alun
Jones, who also represents British prosecutors.
	   Jones alleges Pinochet was responsible for up to 4,000 murders,
including at least one in the United States, and had sent agents to
Spain to ``seek out and kill'' political opponents there.
	   Lawyers for the 82-year-old Pinochet, who is under guard in a
London hospital, contended the Spanish warrant was illegal both
because former heads of state cannot be prosecuted for actions
committed in their ``official capacity'' and because he is not
Spanish.
	   But speaking in Parliament, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said
the government was right not to intervene to overturn the warrant.
	   ``Due process of law must be carried out and it must not be
warped to fit anybody's political agenda,'' he said.
	   In Spain, Judge Baltasar Garzon, who instigated the arrest,
rejected appeals against the warrant made last week by Eduardo
Fungarino, chief prosecutor of the National Court to which Garzon
is also attached.
	   Chilean senator Francisco Prat, in London to support Pinochet,
told a Santiago radio station that the general will be transferred,
probably to a private apartment, in the next day because the
hospital whred he underwent a back operation Oct. 9 complained of
the ``situation of crisis'' caused by his presence. He released no
	   Prat said the new location probably would be be a private
apartment but issued no further details.
	   In its travel advisory, the Foreign Office called the situation
in Chile ``volatile'' and warned of isolated attacks on people
``mistakenly identified as British.''
	   British nationals and British commercial interests could become
``targets of mob violence,'' it cautioned, and Britons should
``keep a low profile.''
	   The British Defense Ministry said the Chilean admirals had
called off a trip to negotiate the possible purchase of three
surplus Type 22 frigates from the Royal Navy.
	   The visit was ``felt by the Chileans to be inappropriate in the
circumstances,'' a Defense Ministry spokesman told The Associated
Press, speaking anonymously.
	   The four Chilean exiles, three of whom live in Britain, fear
Britain's Labor Party government will release Pinochet on
humanitarian grounds. Similar filings are being pursued in
Switzerland, Sweden and France.
	   Judge Garzon has issued a new extradition warrant alleging an
unspecified number of murders, tortures and kidnappings up to 1992,
two years after Pinochet stood down. He remained commander-in-chief
of the Chilean army until March.

Rangers extend option on Gonzalez for 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) _ Juan Gonzalez's 1999 option was
exercised Tuesday by the Texas Rangers.
	   Although management's Player Relations Committee and the
players' association list the option at dlrs 7.25 million, the team
said the figure is actually dlrs 8.5 million because the contract
signed in February 1994 was amended a month later.
	   Gonzalez led the AL in RBIs (157) and doubles (50), hit 45 home
runs, batted a career-high .318. He could win his second AL MVP
award in three years next month.
	   The Rangers also have a dlrs 7.5 million option for the 2000
season. Gonzalez made dlrs 7 million, plus bonuses, this season.

Britain invites French teens to sample English soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A group of French teen-agers will arrive in
Britain on Friday to train with some of the country's top soccer
teams.
	   ``We have invited children from France to train at the clubs
that have French players,'' said a spokesman for Prime Minister
Tony Blair, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   He did not have details of how many French youngsters had been
invited or what the training program would encompass.
	   But the spokesman said the teen-agers would be training with
teams such as the Glasgow Rangers in Scotland, Tottenham Hotspur
and the Arsenal Gunners in north London and the Chelsea club in
southwest London. Other teams were also expected to participate,
but Blair's office did not have a complete list.
	   England is seeking to host the 2006 soccer World Cup. Organizers
are pushing their bid by marketing this country's Premier League as
the most cosmopolitan competition in the world, embracing more
World Cup stars than any other. France hosted the tournament this
summer.
	   A number of heroes from the victorious French World Cup team
currently play in Britain. Emmanuel Petit and Patrick Vieira play
for Arsenal, and the Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger is also a
Frenchman. And French World Cup star Marcel Desailly and his World
Cup teammate Frank LeBoeuf play for Chelsea.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch cut through the
western Caribbean on Tuesday, pummeling coastal Honduras and Belize
with driving rain and fierce winds that snapped trees and sent
thousands of people fleeing for higher ground. Ten storm-related
deaths were reported.
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse declared the highest
state of alert and sent in troops to evacuate thousands of people
from villages on the sparsely populated coast. Thousands more made
their way to safer ground on their own.
	   Most of the population of Belize City fled inland in cars and
government buses, while tourists rushed to find ways out of the
Mexican resorts of Cancun and Cozumel, where officials were bracing
for a possible hit.
	   At 2100 GMT, Mitch was about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of
Honduras and moving west-southwest _ roughly parallel to the coast
_ at 6 mph (10 kph). Its winds dropped from 180 mph (290 kph) to
near 155 mph (250 kph), reducing Mitch to a Category 4 hurricane,
one category below the most powerful. But the 350-mile
(600-kilometer) -wide storm remained very powerful _ and dangerous.
	   Mitch's slow speed made the hurricane's path especially
unpredictable, forecasters said.
	   Earlier in the day, when Mitch's winds were at 180 mph (290 kph)
_ a Category 5 storm _ the U.S. National Weather Service said only
three Atlantic storms were stronger _ Gilbert in 1988, Allen in
1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.
	   But forecasters said the most likely track would carry the storm
into central Belize by early Thursday, though some models showed it
could veer southwest, northwest or even northeast if it slows
further.
	   ``It's moving slowly and the slower-moving the storm, the more
unpredictable it always is,'' said meteorologist Jack Beven at the
U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   Strong winds bent palm trees along the Honduran coast Tuesday,
and heavy rain caused at least four rivers to overflow their banks.
The entire coast of Honduras was under a hurricane warning, and up
to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain was forecast in mountainous
areas.
	   In La Ceiba, on the western Honduran coast, residents fled to
shelters set up in schools and fire stations on higher ground. The
area has the sea to the north, the Cangrejal River to the east and
a creek to the west.
	   Fisherman Manuel Padilla said he wanted to evacuate with his
three children but authorities had not told him where the shelters
were located.
	   ``Nobody has come to see us,'' he complained. ``They've
forgotten us.''
	   Still, hundreds of people waded through knee-deep waters to
safety. At one fire station shelter, about 150 people huddled in
the damp, with no dry blankets or other protection. Some brought
pets, including five parrots.
	   Blanca Almeida Ramirez, 22, said she and her three children fled
early Tuesday when water began to seep into her wooden house. ``The
wood is all rotten inside,'' she said. ``I couldn't stay any
longer.''
	   The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco,
said 5,000 soldiers were deployed to help victims of the storm.
	   Five villages in the northeastern province of Gracias a Dios
were cut off by flooding, but police evacuated all 2,000 residents
before the rivers rose, said national police chief Col. Anael
Perez. Two other villages were cut off by fallen trees.
	   In El Progreso, 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Honduran
capital of Tegucigalpa, the army evacuated more than 5,000 people
who live in low-lying banana plantations along the Ulua River, said
resident Nolly Soliman.
	   Two brothers, Misael and Rainel Juares, were electrocuted Monday
when they tried to take a television antenna down from their roof
in the village of Jutiapa, near La Ceiba.
	   Nicaragua's Red Cross said at least eight people had died in
flooding caused by outer bands of the storm.
	   Early Tuesday, the storm passed almost directly over the tiny
Swan Islands, Honduran outposts used in the 1980s as a U.S. radar
station and radio base for broadcasts to Cuba. Authorities said the
military base lost its roof, but the five soldiers posted there
were unhurt because they took refuge in nearby caves.

Hogan goes back to its roots with new forged iron
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Ben Hogan never liked the idea of his
company being sold to Cosmo World, the Japanese conglomerate best
known for buying Pebble Beach. When the deal was inevitable, he met
Cosmo's president for lunch and spoke loud enough for everyone to
hear.
	   ``I don't know if you know what you've bought,'' Hogan told
Minoru Isutani on that day 10 years ago at Shady Oaks Country Club
in Fort Worth. ``This company is the family jewels. I hope you're
smart enough not to screw it up.''
	   Cosmo never got the message, but Spalding Sports Worldwide has
taken it to heart.
	   Spalding became the fourth owner in 13 years last November when
it bought the Ben Hogan Co. from Bill Goodwin and set out to
restore one of the most respected names in the golf-equipment
industry.
	   ``We probably have one shot at this,'' said Rick Watson, who
moved over from Top-Flite to become the marketing director of the
Hogan Co.
	   It starts Nov. 5 at Shady Oaks, when Valerie Hogan will be on
hand for the launching of the new Apex forged blades, for years the
symbol of high standards that her husband demanded.
	   ``I think it's perfectly wonderful,'' Mrs. Hogan said. ``I've
had such a wonderful feeling, for the first time since Ben's death,
that something good was happening.''
	   Among other things, Spalding has gone back to the Ben Hogan
signature for a logo, recognizing the greatest asset in the
acquisition was the Hogan name.
	   Kevin Martin, president of Evenflo and Spalding Holdings Corp.,
said two months after the purchase: ``We believe with Ben Hogan we
have the Babe Ruth of golf. We have big plans for the Ben Hogan
name.''
	   Perhaps more importantly, it returned the Hogan operation to
Fort Worth.
	   ``The people here are so happy,'' Mrs. Hogan said. ``It means so
much to them to have it back here. There was a deep affection
between the employees and Ben.''
	   When Goodwin moved the Hogan Co. out of Texas in 1993, only 22
of about 600 employees went to Virginia. Upon returning to Fort
Worth, they found an old roster of hundreds of former employees who
had given up on a company that kept changing management.
	   From that roster, six people were offered jobs, and five
accepted. Among them were a quality inspector who had been with
Hogan for 25 years, and a chief assembler of nearly 20 years who
left his job in a steel mill to go back to work in the name of
Hogan.
	   ``We went out and got the A-team,'' said Nick Raffaele, a former
Hoganite rehired as operations manager of the Fort Worth plant. ``I
always joke with Spalding that it was like the Dirty Dozen _ we
went out and got those people out of jail.''
	   Spalding approved the relocation to Fort Worth on Sept. 28.
Three weeks later, production was under way.
	   The new Apex is essentially a combination of two previous models
_ the muscle back and toe line of the popular 1988 irons, which Tom
Kite used to win the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach in 1992; and the
slightly larger, channel back of the 1994 version.
	   The design took shape throughout the year with input from Kite
and Justin Leonard, who used the '94 Apex irons to win the British
Open last year at Royal Troon, just six days before Hogan died.
	   ``This is a club I think Mr. Hogan would be proud of,'' said
Leonard, who grew up playing a set of ``Little Ben'' irons. ``It's
for people who want a pure, forged blade and want to feel
everything. Those are the kind of clubs Mr. Hogan was making and
playing himself.''
	   Hogan started his company after returning from a ticker-tape
parade in New York in 1953, the year he won the Masters, U.S. Open
and British Open. He and Dallas real-estate tycoon Pollard Simon
went into the venture together, but Hogan bought Simon out after an
incident that defined his pursuit of perfection on and off the
course.
	   When the first production set came off the line in the summer of
1954, Hogan wasn't pleased and ordered that they start over _ a
loss of dlrs 100,000.
	   Hogan sold the company to American Machine and Foundry in 1960,
but stayed on as chairman and continued to work on product
development with master designer Gene Sheeley into the early 1990s.

Two Japanese oil companies to merge, form country's largest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Major oil companies Nippon Oil Co. and Mitsubishi
Oil Co. will merge in April 1999 to form Japan's largest petroleum
company, a Nippon Oil spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The two companies will hold separate board of directors'
meetings Wednesday morning to approve a recently concluded basic
agreement to merge, said Nippon Oil spokesman Koshi Okuda.
	   The planned merger will create Japan's largest-oil distributor,
with sales totaling 3 trillion yen (dlrs 25.4 billion) and taking a
24 percent share of the domestic fuel market, Okuda said.
	   The aim of the merger is to increase cost competitiveness and to
counter increased inroads by foreign companies under Japan's newly
liberalized oil market, Okuda said.
	   Nippon Oil is currently Japan's second-largest petroleum
distributor while Mitsubishi Oil ranks sixth, he said.
	   The two companies were to hold a joint press conference later
Wednesday, he added.
	   An official merger contract between the two companies is
expected to be signed by the end of this year and submitted to
shareholders for approval, Okuda said.
	   At present, Idemitsu Kosan Co. holds the top spot in oil
distribution with a 16 percent share in Japan, the Nihon Keizai
business daily reported Wednesday.
	   Nippon Oil and Mitsubishi Oil have been cooperating since 1984
in areas such as jointly supplying each other with products, the
paper reported. It also said there is there is little overlap
between the two companies' oil-refinery sites, and both have large
affiliated retailers.
	   There are currently 13 Japanese oil distributors operating in
Japan. Competition among them is rising amid the lingering economic
recession, according to the Nihon Keizai.

Student allegedly kills schoolmate with ruler in Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVE BULLOCK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ A student accused of
using a metal ruler to kill a 14-year-old schoolmate was being held
on an assault charge.
	   Police say Eumorris George Jr. had returned to his junior high
school's drafting classroom last Wednesday after school to return a
borrowed T-square, a heavy metal ruler. As he left, another student
struck him in the head with the ruler.
	   George was rushed to a local hospital and then flown to a
hospital in Puerto Rico, where he died Thursday.
	   Police have not released the name of the suspect, who is being
held in a juvenile facility on an assault charge. Acting St. Croix
Police Chief Howard Daniel said the student could face more serious
charges after the investigation is completed.
	   Violence has been a problem in Virgin Islands schools over the
past year. In March, about 500 youths in St. Croix participated in
a march against violence after four stabbings and one shooting
during a four-month period.
	   On May 15, 15-year-old Kervin Tavernier was stabbed to death by
a fellow student at a St. Croix high school.
	   The ruler attack has prompted education officials to order
conflict-resolution courses in St. Croix schools.
	   Education commissioner Liston Davis said Tuesday he had also
ordered additional counseling for students and staff at Arthur E.
Richards Junior High School, where the assault occurred.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   OSTROZUB, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces drew back Tuesday from
former Kosovo battlefronts, holding off the immediate threat of
NATO airstrikes. But the alliance reserved the right to launch an
attack anytime if the situation worsens. To keep up the pressure on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the 16-nation military
alliance decided to maintain more than 400 NATO warplanes on alert,
but did not set any new deadlines for airstrikes after the previous
one expired Tuesday. That continuing threat should help guarantee
the safety of hundreds of thousands of refugees, terrified of
returning home unless government troops and Serb police are held
back. More than 4,000 Serb policemen were reported to have pulled
out of Kosovo on Monday alone, vacating many villages and dug-in
positions. That encouraged a few among the 300,000 displaced people
in this largely ethnic Albanian province to take a chance on
returning home. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Making good on a pledge to Israel to fight
harder against militants, Palestinian security forces arrested two
Palestinian suspects Tuesday in the killing of a Jewish settler.
Settlers set up a roadside stone memorial Tuesday in the West Bank
town of Hebron, where the body of 29-year-old Danny Vargas was
dumped from his car Monday. It bore the inscription ``Avenge the
blood.'' Politicians and friends, gathered at Vargas' open grave
Tuesday to demand that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
back out of his agreement to withdraw from more West Bank land.
Despite the latest violence, Netanyahu said he was determined to
withdraw troops from another 13 percent of the West Bank over the
next 12 weeks, as promised. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch cut through the
western Caribbean on Tuesday, pummeling coastal Honduras and Belize
with driving rain and fierce winds that snapped trees and sent
thousands of people fleeing for higher ground. Ten storm-related
deaths were reported. Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse
declared the highest state of alert and sent in troops to evacuate
thousands of people from villages on the sparsely populated coast.
Thousands more made their way to safer ground on their own. Most of
the population of Belize City fled inland, while tourists rushed to
find ways out of the Mexican resorts of Cancun and Cozumel. The
hurricane's winds dropped from 180 mph (290 kph) to near 155 mph
(250 kph), reducing Mitch to a Category 4 hurricane, one category
below the most powerful. But the 350-mile (600-kilometer) -wide
storm remained very powerful _ and dangerous. Forecasters said the
most likely track would carry the storm into central Belize by
early Thursday, though some models showed it could veer southwest,
northwest or even northeast if it slows further. (HURRICANE MITCH)
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A special envoy of the U.N.
secretary-general met Tuesday with embattled Myanmar opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi, diplomatic sources said. Alvaro de Soto,
an assistant U.N. secretary-general, also met with two leaders of
Myanmar's military government on his official visit to discuss
political and human rights issues. De Soto arrived Tuesday morning
on his fifth visit to Myanmar _ also known as Burma _ as a U.N.
envoy since 1995. Relations between the government and the
opposition have deteriorated sharply since de Soto's last visit,
with the military increasing its repression of the pro-democracy
movement and Suu Kyi's party increasing its challenges to the
government's legitimacy. In the past few months, almost 1,000
members of Suu Kyi's party have been detained. (UN-MYANMAR)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An infirm Russian President Boris Yeltsin sought
sanctuary Tuesday at a rest home outside Moscow, retreating further
from the political spotlight and leaving the country guessing about
the exact nature of his illness. The Russian leader checked into
the Barvikha sanitarium for an open-ended stay to recover from
what's been described as high blood pressure and exhaustion.
Yeltsin has played only a marginal role in dealing with the
country's painful economic crisis, and some analysts say the
country is being guided mostly by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
who has been in office less than two months. Primakov traveled to
Vienna, Austria, on Tuesday to fill in for Yeltsin at a summit
between Russia and the European Union. Yeltsin called off the trip
Monday due to his illness, the latest in a string of maladies that
have dogged him for years. (RUSSIA-YELTSIN)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell Tuesday, giving back sizable gains
and halting a nine-session winning streak by the small-company
sector. The Dow Jones industrial average failed to sustain an early
advance for the third straight session and dropped 66.17 points _
or by 0.8 percent _ to 8,366.04 after shedding a 100-point gain.
Broader indicators held out longer than the Dow, but turned
negative near the close. The Russell 2000 fell for the first time
in 10 sessions after surging 20 percent from a 2 1/2 year low
reached on Oct. 8. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar fell against major currencies Tuesday
as the latest gauge in consumer confidence fell, which investors
took as a sign of further weakening in the economy. The falling Dow
Jones industrial average also helped push the dollar lower against
the German mark. In late New York dealings, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6519 marks, down from 1.6627 late Monday. The dollar also was
changing hands at 117.75 yen, down from 119.10. (US-DOLLAR)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Consumer confidence in the United States tumbled
to its lowest level in nearly two years in October amid increasing
concerns about global economic and political troubles. The
Conference Board reported Tuesday its index of consumer confidence
fell 9.1 points to 117.3 from a revised 126.4 in September. The
last time it was lower was in December 1996. October's decline, the
fourth straight month of retreat, was much larger than Wall Street
analysts expected. The index now is down 20.9 points from its
29-year high in June. ``Growing anxiety about the financial
markets, combined with political concerns and recent layoff
announcements, have given consumers the jitters,'' said Lynn
Franco, associate director at the Conference Board, a private New
York research group. (US-ECONOMY)
	   WUERZBURG, Germany (AP) _ Two German labor unions voted Tuesday
in favor of pursuing a merger with three others in the service
industry that would create one of the biggest unions in the world.
A majority of delegates at a meeting of Germany's print union,
IG-Medien, voted in the Bavarian city of Wuerzburg in favor of
talks to set up the merger. In the northern city of Bremen, a union
representing the banking and insurance sectors also voted for
talks. Three other unions must still vote on the interim step
before talks can begin. A final vote on creating the super-union is
expected in November 1999. (GERMANY-UNION MERGER)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Desperate for cash to pay off huge foreign debts,
Russia's government is driving oil exports to a record high,
abandoning pledges to cut sales to reduce oil surplus on world
markets, an official said Tuesday. Russia will have to pay about
dlrs 3 billion toward its foreign debt this year and about dlrs 18
billion next year. To come up with the money, the government is
driving up oil exports, Russia's top foreign-currency earner.
``This year will in fact be a record high,'' Energy Minister Sergei
Generalov said. He gave no exact figures, but Russian news agencies
said exports would be 115 million to 116 million metric tons (805
million to 811 million barrels) this year. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
received promises of European Union support on Tuesday for his
government's reform efforts, but no new financial commitments to
bolster the country's devastated economy. Instead, Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima said he hoped a second installment of a
dlrs 22.6 billion International Monetary Fund loan package can be
disbursed as soon as Russia submits an economic reform program.
Substituting for an ailing President Boris Yeltsin, Primakov
arrived in Vienna Tuesday to brief the European Union on plans to
overcome the worst economic crisis in Russia's post-Soviet era.
Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency. (EU-RUSSIA)
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ With Brazil on the front lines of the
global financial crisis, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is
preparing to unveil a package of tax increases and budget cuts.
While the full details will only be announced Wednesday by Finance
Minister Pedro Malan, rumors about what the package will entail
have been circulating in the local press for weeks. According to
these unconfirmed reports, the package should involve three basic
items: a tax increase, spending cuts and structural reforms to
social security and civil service. The steps are seen shoring up
investor confidence and making the country more eligible for an aid
package from the International Monetary Fund. (BRAZIL-ECONOMY)

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Luciano Pavarotti isn't ready yet for his final
curtain call.
	   The 63-year-old tenor said in Tuesday's New York Post that he is
recovering just fine from hip replacement surgery in July and a
knee replacement on the other leg a month later.
	   ``I am recovering great,'' he said from his home in Italy.
``These things take time. My doctor said it was imperative to
continue the therapy.''
	   Questions arose about his possible retirement after the
Metropolitan Opera announced he was canceling three November
appearances in ``Tosca.''
	   Is he following doctor's orders?
	   ``I am doing even more,'' he said. ``It is not big problem. You
know, my father is 86, vocalizes every day and sings solo at church
in full voice. And I am my father's son.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ian McEwan was awarded the prestigious Booker
Prize for fiction Tuesday.
	   McEwan, 50, received dlrs 35,000 at the 1998 awards ceremony in
London's Guildhall for his novel ``Amsterdam,'' which tells the
story of two men embroiled in scandal when the lover of both is
photographed in compromising positions with the foreign secretary.
	   ``I feel as if I'm in a dream as I'm sure all winners before me
have felt too,'' the author said as he received his award from
former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. It was McEwan's third
nomination.
	   McEwan previously was nominated for ``The Comfort of
Strangers,'' in 1981, and ``Black Dogs,'' in 1992.
	   A Booker Prize can more than double hardback sales and has
greatly boosted library readership of winning books.
	   The prize, established in 1968, is bestowed each year on the
best novel written in English in Britain or Commonwealth nations.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Richard Leakey resigned Tuesday from
Parliament, saying his job as Kenya's director of wildlife services
is incompatible with his legislative duties.
	   Last month, President Daniel arap Moi chose the world-renowned
paleontologist to head the cash-strapped agency. A third-generation
Kenyan of British origin, Leakey was pushed out by Moi in 1994 as
head of the same program in a dispute over political control.
	   Leakey said he hand-delivered his letter of resignation to the
Parliament speaker.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ John Frankenheimer has joined the fray
over a video store's editing of ``Titanic'' tapes.
	   The director of ``The Manchurian Candidate'' and ``Seven Days in
May'' urged an industry boycott of the video store that offers to
cut the racier scenes from copies of the movie.
	   For dlrs 5, Don and Carol Biesinger's Sunrise Family Video will
edit out the scene in which Kate Winslet poses nude and another
that suggests Leonardo DiCaprio's and Winslet's characters have
sex. For dlrs 3 more, employees will edit out other scenes from
James Cameron's movie.
	   ``The guy is mutilating art,'' Frankenheimer said in Tuesday's
Salt Lake Tribune. ``It's like being a museum curator and taking a
Picasso painting of a nude and painting a bathing suit on it and
trying to pass it off as a Picasso.''
	   Biesinger defended his store's editing by noting that only
copies brought in by customers are altered. Once people buy videos,
they can do whatever they want with them, he said.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus Airways is shelving plans to
introduce non-smoking flights after cabin staff threatened not to
comply to protest the exemption of pilots from the ban.
	   ``Can you imagine how a passenger or a steward who is not
allowed to smoke would feel if the cockpit door opened and all that
smoke gushed out?'' asked Costas Demetriou, head of the unth% sLoking ban on its London and Athens
flights, the company said.
	   Cyprus Airways, which is 80 percent government-owned, has had
notoriously tense relations between unions and management.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Miss Israel should not expect open arms.
	   Citing a state of war with Israel, Lebanon's new beauty queen
declared Tuesday that she would not shake hands with her Israeli
counterpart at the Miss World and Miss Universe contests.
	   ``We all know that Lebanon is in conflict with Israel which is
occupying an important region in our country. If I see her, I will
not shake hands with her and will try to keep a distance from her
so that I won't have to shake hands with her,'' said Clemence
Ashkar.
	   Ashkar, an 18-year-old sociology student, was chosen Friday as
Miss Lebanon from 23 contestants during a four-hour ceremony.
	   Lebanon, which is technically at war with Israel, forbids any
dealing or contacts with the Jewish state.
	   Since 1985, Israel has occupied a border enclave in southern
Lebanon as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks.

Palestinian airport to open at last, but potential disputes loom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAHANIYA, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Gaza International Airport has shiny
new terminals, a control tower ready to be filled with
state-of-the-art equipment, a VIP lounge that resembles something
out of Arabian Nights. It has everything, in fact, except planes
and passengers.
	   That's about to change.
	   The airport _ a potent symbol of Palestinian statehood hopes _
is to be inaugurated within a matter of days, its long-delayed
opening finally cleared under the land-for-peace accord signed last
week in Washington.
	   But it remains to be seen whether the airport, with security
responsibilities shared by Israel and the Palestinians, will turn
out to be a showcase of cooperation or a new source of tensions.
	   In many ways, the airport's opening represents a leap of faith
on Israel's part, marking a significant loosening of the Jewish
state's security grip over the Palestinian lands.
	   Up until now, the West Bank and Gaza Strip have had no direct
link to the outside world. Gaza has no working seaport, and the
Palestinian lands' external borders are controlled by Israel.
	   Set in the gritty flatlands at Gaza's southern tip, the
airport's Moroccan-designed buildings _ all elegant archways and
gleaming glass _ have an incongruous look amid a landscape dotted
with prickly pear and plastic greenhouses.
	   Pink Hebron stone and multicolored Moroccan tiles with Islamic
motifs adorn the terminal buildings' floors and walls. The VIP
lounge boasts a replica of the ceiling dome at the Al Aqsa mosque
in Jerusalem.
	   On Tuesday, workers were busy installing woodwork and
steamrolling asphalt in the parking lot. Armed Palestinian guards
couldn't resist an occasional joyride in an open-backed jeep along
the 3,000-meter (3,300-yard) runway, long enough to accommodate all
but the biggest jumbo jets.
	   The Palestinians want to stage a festive inauguration of the
1,125-acre (450-hectare), dlrs 64 million airport sometime in early
November. But the specific date _ like many other operational
decisions _ still needs Israeli approval.
	   Once the airport is running, Palestinians will carry out their
own passenger check-in, but a second and likely more stringent
document and luggage inspection will be done in a joint
Israeli-Palestinian wing.
	   All flight plans must be approved by Israel, which controls the
airspace over the Palestinian lands. The airport will be closed
only one day of the year, and that in deference to the Israelis:
Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar.
	   Even under such strictures, Palestinians are bursting with pride
over the opening, which originally was to have taken place two
years ago.
	   ``It's a very, very important symbol to us, of what we have
already achieved, and what we hope to achieve _ statehood,'' said
Brig. Gen. Fayez Zaidan, the airport's director.
	   To underscore that point, the Palestinians hope to have landings
soon by as many foreign dignitaries as possible _ most notably
President Bill Clinton, who is to visit in December.
	   Another salve to Palestinian pride will be finally having a base
for their flagship carrier, Palestinian Airlines, which can roll
out its prize possession: a Boeing 727 donated by a Saudi prince.
It has not yet been determined what other airlines will fly there.
	   The airport's opening will likely be a point of personal
satisfaction for Yasser Arafat, who spurned Israeli offers to land
his own official plane there, saying he would wait until it was
open for general use.
	   At one point, the Palestinian Authority wanted to name the
facility Yasser Arafat International Airport, but quietly backed
off. Zaidan, the director, said the Palestinian leader asked that
it not be named after him _ at least for now.
	   Once open, normal operations will be phased in slowly, starting
with regular service to Amman, Jordan, Cairo, Egypt, and Jeddah,
Saudi Arabia.
	   For now, though, the Palestinans are taking deep satisfaction in
the small things, pointing with delight to an international
designation that will include GZ for Gaza in the airport code.
	   Airport director Zaidan, a 53-year-old veteran of the Jordanian
and Libyan air forces, had the look of a man who had come into his
own at last.
	   ``There are sure to be problems _ that's just life,'' he said.
``It just takes time. And that we have.''

Urban Africans invoke village spirits with bloody celebration

<TEXT>
	   SAWIE, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Eyes screwed shut, Joseph Akpaman
flashes a hunting knife to his mouth and furiously saws across his
tongue until what appears to be a wedge of pink flesh drops into
his hand.
	   As family and friends stare silently, the burly 45-year-old
proudly displays his prize between two fingers. He keeps his mouth
tightly closed preventing the crowd gathered to watch the spectacle
from seeing his tongue.
	   Stumbling away from the village square into the rain forest,
Akpaman reemerges several minutes later with his tongue intact,
covered in a leafy green paste that he says is a mix of healing
herbs.
	   ``The mystical powers are mine!'' Akpaman shouts raggedly to the
crowd, which responds with cheers.
	   Whether magic or sleight-of-hand, the performance is the climax
of the Dipri _ a frenzied, blood-filled celebration that epitomizes
the clash between modern and traditional society in the Ivory
Coast, an African country where Western culture is embraced but
tribal customs are fiercely protected.
	   The Dipri is both a sacred ceremony and rowdy revelry for sleepy
villages in the patchwork of cocoa farms and dwindling tropical
forests inland from Abidjan, Ivory Coast's commercial capital of
skyscrapers and slums.
	   Outsiders, including European tourists, gawk at urban dwellers
who arrive in Peugeot sedans and Mercedes buses to take part in the
festival, where antics include death-defying feats of masochism
with iron blades and shards of glass.
	   For Akpaman, who was born in a stone hut in Sawie but now works
in a factory in Abidjan, about 100 kilometers (65 miles) away, the
celebration is a spiritual homecoming.
	   ``My heart and soul is in the village,'' he says during a break
in the festivities, holding a squirming frog that he will later eat
live. ``I have no choice except to live as my father and my
grandfather did.''
	   A throwback to pre-colonial times when tribal kings ruled
farming fiefdoms in the rain forests of southern Ivory Coast, the
Dipri is performed throughout the year in more than a dozen forest
villages that are ruled by the small Abidji tribe.
	   The grisly rites are traditionally meant to keep evil spirits
away from the villages, but now they are just as important in
strengthening roots between city folk and their ancestors.
	   Akpaman explains his behavior as an outward display of his
ability to endure pain and discomfort, and hence remain loyal to
his ancestors and village cousins.
	   Not everyone has such lofty motives. For many younger men and
boys, the Dipri is an excuse to go wild in a way that harks of
unruly teen-agers the world over. They drink lots of alcohol and
commit stunts that ordinarily would land them in jail.
	   Respected citizens join the mayhem, falling into stony-eyed
trances they say is caused by supernatural forces, including those
of ancestors.
	   On the second day of the festival in Sawie, people young and old
chant and walk dazedly around the village eating lumps of dirt. A
few strip nearly naked and throw their own urine and feces at one
another and bystanders.
	   Several young boys wield homemade weapons made from bamboo,
string and gunpowder that they use to blast rocks over the heads of
frightened onlookers. They laugh when a gun explodes in the hands
of one boy, causing minor burns to his hands.
	   ``Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!'' an unclad woman screams with disturbing
regularity as she staggers past _ and into _ bystanders.
	   A clutch of men growl while they plunge knifes rhythmically into
their abdomen, drawing blood but stopping short of serious injury.
Others, their faces contorted, eat glass whiskey bottles, gleefully
chomping the thick shards between their teeth, then swallowing.
	   ``Nobody will be hurt,'' Akpaman reassures a group of
worried-looking visitors, backslapping with a hand dripping of
spilled body fluids, including blood, sweat and spittle. ``These
are the mystical powers that our ancestors gave us.''
	   Not everyone is so confident. Some people think the Dipri
festival is in danger of losing its spiritual gravity for a
generation more interested in rap music than juju, West Africa's
equivalent of Caribbean voodoo that is tightly infused into the
Dipri festival.
	   Seri Dedy, a sociologist at the University of Abidjan, says many
practitioners of traditional medicine were once well-versed in
performing magical feats, such as the supposed healing of Akpaman's
tongue.
	   But the ancient Abidji art of ``magical remedy'' is increasingly
rare, he says.
	   ``The old traditions are disappearing,'' Dedy says. ``There are
still people around who can perform these miracles, but their
secrets are disappearing.''
	   Although the forest tribes have for more than a generation
reaped a measure of prosperity from farms that produce the world's
biggest cocoa crop, development has brought modernity to Ivory
Coast. Many people live in Abidjan, where there is a shopping mall
and trendy shops _ and on the other extreme, slums of cramped
squalor.
	   Nevertheless, village elders like Kadja Opolou, who says he is
105 and looks it, believe the Dipri will survive because it brings
people back to where they come from.
	   Young men return from cities to be initiated into manhood in a
secret ceremony on the first night of the festival. The following
morning a female dog is sacrificed and the men drink its blood for
strength and spiritual staying-power.
	   ``We will disappear as a people if we do not honor our
customs,'' Opolou says.

Japanese incense-lovers revel in `the Way of Scents'

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Silently pick up the warm cup, bring it to your
nose and breathe deep. Your head fills with sensation: steam
curling off cinnamon tea, a monastery at vespers, perhaps a rolling
field of lavender.
	   This is the world of ``kodo,'' or the Way of Scents, a
centuries-old ritual appreciation of rare incense _ and a classic
example of the timeless Japanese quest of the sublime.
	   ``I feel it's a type of healing,'' said Suzue Sugawara after a
recent fragrance-smelling session in Tokyo. ``I'm always so busy,
but with this experience, I can find myself again.''
	   Incense appreciation in Japan stretches back at least to the
11th century, with strong links to literature and other aesthetic
cults like the tea ceremony or flower arranging.
	   But kodo is among the most rarefied of Japanese pursuits.
Estimates of adherents run from a few hundred to a few thousand _
compared to millions of tea enthusiasts _ and many younger people
have no idea it even exists.
	   One reason is cost. The incense itself _ natural resins imported
from Southeast Asia _ can run 16,000 yen ( dlrs 120) a gram. The
implements used, incense cups and other tools, can add hundreds or
even thousands of dollars.
	   Despite those negatives, incense appreciation isn't about to die
out in Japan, thanks to a select crowd of zealots who find
spirituality, therapeutic value and ethereal pleasure in every
whiff.
	   ``With tea, you can grow more of it every year,'' said Yoko
Obata, a kodo master at Koju Inc., an incense dealer in the swanky
Ginza district of Tokyo. ``But with incense, once it's used up,
it's gone.''
	   Experiencing the Way of Scents speaks volumes about the Japanese
infatuation with form, reverence for ritual and age-old yearning
for transcendence.
	   At a gathering at Koju _ established in the ancient capital of
Kyoto in 1582 to serve the aristocracy _ 15 people sit quietly
around a long table and study copies of a short ``waka'' poem
setting the theme for the day's session.
	   The basic idea behind such practice sessions is simple enough:
Students sample two or three scents. Then the order of the scents
is changed, an additional ``wild card'' incense is added, and
students rely on their noses to correctly identify the fragrances.
	   But kodo is much more than just sniffing at jossticks.
	   Every move is prescribed. The ``master'' running the session
works with precision, arranging tools like pincers and chopsticks,
readying incense cups containing hot charcoals covered with neatly
raked ash.
	   All the terminology used is borrowed from the poem of the day.
The first scent, for example, might be called ``Remains of
summer.'' Correctly identifying all the scents is not ``You win!'',
but something more elegant, like ``Full moon of mid-autumn.''
	   The master puts a postage-stamp sized mica chip on the hot ash
and carefully places incense on it, where the resin heats up and
emits a subtle, smokeless fragrance. After a few test sniffs, the
master passes the cup to the group.
	   The first round is a snap. The cup is passed in silence, each
scent clearly distinguishable from the others _ one is strongly
cinnamon, one is musky, the third is lighter, with only subtle
traces of cinnamon.
	   But in kodo, appearances can be deceiving.
	   The art involves hundreds of varied scents, all classified into
six categories. Masters dedicate decades of their lives to learning
the nuances of fragrance.
	   In the second round of the session, the scents all seem similar,
each one sharing elements of the others. Even longtimers can be
stumped.
	   Fortunately, the point of kodo is appreciation _ not accuracy.
Adherents rave about the soothing effect of the intense
concentration required to sort out the subtle differences between
smells.
	   During the 90-minute session, the outside world fades. The sound
of high-heels in a nearby hallway, music from a neighboring store,
all fall away as minds and noses focus on fragrance.
	   ``It's not just a matter of getting the scents right,'' said
Obata, 42, who got hooked on incense as a teen-ager. ``It's like a
zen experience.''

	   OSTROZUB, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Avdullah Krasniqi loaded up his farm
wagon with wife, kids and household goods and headed home, less out
of confidence that NATO has forced an end to the Kosovo crisis than
the fact that it was getting colder by the day in his mountain
refuge.
	   ``We spent three months in the mountains. It's very cold,'' he
said in a roadside conversation Tuesday as family members sat in a
wagon on a huge pile of carpets, kitchen utensils and other
household goods, all pulled by the family tractor.
	   The Krasniqis wanted very badly to go home, but remain wary of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   ``We don't have any faith in Milosevic,'' he said, licking his
thick dark moustache. He noted his next-door neighbor was shot and
killed on his doorstep.
	   As many as 4,100 Serb policemen pulled out of Kosovo on Monday
alone, diplomatic observers said, vacating many villages and dug-in
positions. The pullback encouraged a few among the estimated
300,000 displaced people in this largely ethnic Albanian province
to take a chance on returning home.
	   That was enough to convince NATO to not to push ahead with
airstrikes as the Tuesday evening deadline passed for Milosevic to
comply with the peace deal he reached Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the alliance would
keep up its guard and reserve the right to strike later if
Milosevic resumes his crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   Among those demands were reduction of troops and police in
Kosovo to levels of last February, when fighting broke out between
government forces and the separatist ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 10 to 1 in the
province.
	   ``We have observed what I would consider significant reductions
in the Serbian police presence in the field,'' said Shaun Byrnes,
head of the American section of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission, spearhead of what eventually will be 2,000 ``ground
verifiers'' who will make sure that Milosevic is living up to the
peace agreement.
	   ``Last night, we watched convoys of Serbian police leaving
Kosovo and going north into Serbia proper,'' he said Tuesday. ``We
estimated that there were roughly 4,100. That's quite a few
policemen.''
	   Neither the diplomatic observers nor Associated Press reporters
saw any roadblocks or checkpoints anywhere they traveled in the
province Tuesday.
	   In Malisevo, a former rebel stronghold 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina, hundreds of ethnic Albanians filled the
streets Tuesday morning, revisiting for the first time the homes
and shops they abandoned when Serb forces overran the town July 28.
	   The top floor of Osman Mazreku's two-story house had been gutted
by fire. Clothing and garbage were strewn across the ground floor.
	   ``I'm sorry to see my house in this condition, but I'm happy to
be alive,'' he said. ``That's all that matters.''
	   No one planned to stay the night, however, or bring their
families back until police vacated a building on the edge of the
village. As if to underscore the uncertainty, the streets emptied
after a short burst of automatic rifle fire when a small convoy of
armored police vehicles arrived to reinforce the police presence at
the building.
	   In Orahovac, 16 kilometers (10 miles) down the road, Batishahe
Isma stood in the doorway of her once- comfortable home, eyes
roaming over the mess and destruction left behind by the police who
occupied it for three months.
	   ``They took everything but the floor,'' she said, waving her
broom vaguely. ``What they didn't take they slashed or burned.''

Cardoso appeals to Brazilians to support new austerity plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with details of Cardoso's speech and
market close. &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has
presented the broad outlines of his long-awaited economic austerity
package, asking the Brazilian people to support a plan that spreads
the pain ``with an eye towards protecting the poorest.''
	   Cardoso said Tuesday that he would call on Congress to slash 8.7
billions reals (dlrs 7.3 billion) from the 1999 budget, calling it
a cut without precedent.
	   The former economy minister used a pointer and charts to explain
how key reforms to the social security system and civil service
that have languished in Congress were necessary to cut a ballooning
deficit, though he did not go into detail.
	   He also talked of raising certain taxes for companies, civil
servants and a tax on financial transactions. Finance Minister
Pedro Malan is expected to announce the specifics of the package
Wednesday.
	   ``The definitive solution is not in these measures. What will
balance our books is the reforms,'' Cardoso said.
	   The package aims to attack an enormous budget deficit of dlrs 65
billion, or 7 percent of the country's gross domestic product, and
shore up an economy reeling from the fallout from financial
problems in Asia and Russia.
	   The package is seen generally as a prerequisite to any bailout
package from the International Monetary Fund and other global
lending institutions. The IMF is reportedly readying a rescue
package worth about dlrs 30 billion.
	   Reaction to the austerity plan was mixed.
	   ``The question remains if the cuts expected to result from the
tax hikes and spending cuts will be enough to stabilize the
relationship between the deficit and the GDP,'' said University of
Sao Paulo economist Joaquim Eloy de Toledo. ``I don't think so and
the president showed he doesn't think so either when he said this
was just the beginning.''
	   Nothing Cardoso said was substantially different than
unconfirmed reports circulating in the local press for weeks about
what the package would entail.
	   And they were a far cry from the rumors of devaluation that
rocked Brazilian stock exchanges Tuesday afternoon.
	   The Sao Paulo stock exchange, Bovespa, closed off 1.5 percent
for the day after dipping as low as 3.1 percent before the Central
Bank firmly denied the rumor.
	   None of the measures are likely to be popular _ a major reason
why Cardoso held off announcing the plan until after Sunday's
runoff elections for governors in 13 states _ though some
economists think that the steps have more chance of passing then
they did last year in the run-up to an election.
	   Despite the delay in revealing the austerity measures,
opposition governors won in several key races. Because governors in
Brazil often hold greater influence over congressmen from their
states than the president does, Cardoso may still have some
difficulty getting his measures through the congress.
	   But the pressure remains high on Cardoso to follow through on
his promises to get Brazil's economy going again.
	   ``In the past, Brazil got so many waivers (about not meeting
established goals) from the IMF that Cardoso really has to shore up
confidence or in the country or people won't take it seriously
anymore,'' said Walder de Gois, president of the Brazilian
Institute of Political Studies.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite bowing to NATO demands over
Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic is reinforcing by grip on
power, firing his secret service chief and refusing to budge on his
purge of Serbia's independent media.
	   On Tuesday, the government announced that secret service chief
Jovica Stanisic had been fired and replaced by police Gen. Radomir
Markovic. Staniscic was purportedly critical of Milosevic's
crackdown in Kosovo and his alliance with ultranationalist
extremists.
	   His removal indicated that hard-liners were gaining ground
against reformers within the Yugoslav government. Milosevic has
used a threat of NATO attacks against military targets in
Yugoslavia to clamp down on his opponents at home.
	   NATO said Tuesday that Milosevic had withdrawn enough forces
from Kosovo to avoid airstrikes. But the alliance reserved the
right to attack if he resumes his crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists.
	   Opposition leader Zoran Djindjic said Stanisic's replacement was
``worrying'' and reminded him of the Communist regime in former
Yugoslavia that was abandoned in 1990.
	   Another opposition leader, Vuk Obradovic, said Stanisic was a
``professional'' and a ``reasonable'' man. He said he expected more
key figures in Serbia to resign or be replaced.
	   At the same time, Milosevic shows no sign of easing up on his
crackdown on independent Serbian media. In a meeting Tuesday with
editors and broadcasters, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill promised he
would again push the issue with the autocratic president.
	   ``I assure you I have raised the issue at the highest level here
very forcefully,'' Hill told reporters. ``I am sorry to say... we
don't seem to have ... results.''
	   Last week, Serbian parliament passed a new media law severely
restricting press freedom and instituting severe fines for those
publishing ``anti-patriotic'' and ``anti-government'' stories.
	   ``You cannot wipe out independent media any more than you can
deprive people of oxygen,'' Hill said.
	   ``It is a 19th century means, not worthy even of the Ottoman
empire,'' Hill said, referring to Serbia's ancient enemy, the
Ottoman Turks.
	   Also Tuesday, independent daily NT Plus halted publication after
telephone threats to its chief editor, Momcilo Djogovic.
	   ``The new media law has turned into a widespread lynching of
journalists,'' Djogovic said.
	   On Monday, two Serbian independent daily newspapers, Nasa Borba
and Danas, which were briefly banned by the government earlier this
month, stopped publishing in protest after police raided the office
of another non-government newspaper, confiscated property and fined
the paper for alleged anti-state activity.
	   Monday night, police raided the apartment of Ivan Tadic, manager
of DT-press publishing company, which publishes the weekly
Evropljanin, or European. All Tadic's belongings were taken away
except his baby's crib and clothes.
	   Over the weekend, a Belgrade court fined his weekly dlrs 246,000
for publishing an article that accused Milosevic of introducing
``dictatorship'' and leading the country into political and
economic chaos.
	   The restrictive media law was passed amid anti-Western sentiment
in the country, fueled by NATO threats to launch airstrikes to end
the crisis in Kosovo, the southern Serbian province where ethnic
Albanian secessionists have been battling Yugoslav troops.

Yeltsin checks into rest home for open-ended stay

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While Boris Yeltsin retreated into a rest home
outside Moscow, exhausted and with high blood pressure, his prime
minister took off in the president's place for a summit with
European Union officials.
	   Russia, meanwhile, was left guessing yet again about the exact
nature of Yeltsin's illness.
	   Yeltsin checked into the Barvikha sanitarium Tuesday for an
open-ended stay.
	   The 67-year-old Russian leader has played only a marginal role
in dealing with the country's painful economic crisis, and some
analysts say the country is being guided mostly by Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, who has been in office less than two months.
	   Primakov traveled to Vienna, Austria, on Tuesday to fill in for
Yeltsin at the EU summit. Yeltsin called off the trip Monday due to
his illness, the latest in a string of maladies that have dogged
him for years.
	   ``Ever since he was appointed, Primakov has been acting more as
a president than as a chairman of the government,'' said Nikolai
Petrov, a political analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for Peace
in Moscow.
	   Yeltsin has put in few full days at the Kremlin since the
spring, and now his doctors say he must rest to recover from
extreme fatigue and high blood pressure.
	   The president did not look visibly ill in television footage of
him meeting with Primakov on Tuesday, before the prime minister
left for Vienna and the president moved to the sanitarium.
	   Dr. Michael DeBakey, an American cardiologist who consulted with
Yeltsin's doctors before and after his 1996 heart surgery,
predicted Tuesday it would take Yeltsin at least a week to bounce
back.
	   But ``he'll recover from all this and he'll be back at work,''
DeBakey told The Associated Press in Houston.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Yeltsin would
undergo ``a course of restoration treatment.'' The length of his
stay depends on the treatment, he said, without elaborating.
	   Despite reassurances by the president and his doctors that
Yeltsin has no crippling illness and will serve out his term, which
lasts until the middle of 2000, few in Russia believe that Yeltsin
will ever again be the robust, reform-minded leader that he was
during his early years in power.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who came in second in 1996
presidential elections, said Tuesday that Yeltsin's aides were
``mocking'' Russians by insisting the president wasn't seriously
ill.
	   ``Mr. Yeltsin's inability to work has been obvious to us for
quite a long time,'' Zyuganov said at a news conference. He called
for Yeltsin to undergo an independent medical exam and for the
results to be made public.
	   Yeltsin's aides have often provided only partial information
about Yeltsin's ailments, contributing to a general mood of
skepticism and speculation that his condition is worse than
announced.
	   If Yeltsin were to resign, Primakov would succeed him on an
interim basis, and new elections would be called within three
months.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Yeltsin's illness should not hamper decisions on economic policy
because Primakov was in already handling them.
	   Yeltsin postponed a meeting with Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman scheduled for next week in Moscow, Tudjman's spokesman said
Tuesday. Yeltsin has also put off a trip to Malaysia next month,
though his aides insist he will still go to India in December.

Milbury to meet Palffy in Vienna
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ New York Islanders general manager
Mike Milbury flew to Vienna late Monday night to meet with unsigned
restricted free agent right wing Zigmund Palffy.
	   ``My goal in meeting with Zigmund face-to-face is to bring this
issue to a conclusion,'' Milbury said in a statement issued
Tuesday. He would not comment further until after the dinner
meeting with Palffy and Petr Svoboda, a representative of Palffy's
agent, Paul Kraus.
	   Palffy, 26, had been looking for dlrs 6.8 million a year on a
multiyear contract, though he has dropped his demands to dlrs 6
million per season. Team president David Seldin recently pulled the
Islanders' only offer off the table, a three-year deal averaging
dlrs 4.3 million a season.
	   ``Mike went there to talk to Ziggy in a serious way about
playing hockey this season,'' Seldin said in his only comment.
	   Kraus was more vocal about the situation.
	   ``It was Mike's idea,'' Kraus said of the meeting. ``There's not
much progress. Mike's pitch was for ... less money than previously
offered. We turned down their offer. We are interested in making a
deal. Obviously, they are not.''
	   Palffy, a native of Slovakia, has played the last three full
seasons with the Islanders, scoring at least 43 goals in each with
a high of 48 in 1996-97. He was an all-star last season.
	   Milbury, who is also the team's head coach, missed Tuesday
night's game against Los Angeles, but was expected to return for
Thursday night's home game with New Jersey. Associate coach Lorne
Henning ran the team in Milbury's absence.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch battered Honduras'
northern coast with fierce winds and lashing rains on Tuesday,
killing at least 11 people in the region and forcing tens of
thousands to flee in three Caribbean nations.
	   By 0000 GMT, Mitch was whipping the Honduran coast with
hurricane-force winds. Honduras' army and police evacuated
thousands of people from villages on the sparsely populated coast.
Thousands more made their way to higher ground on their own.
	   Most of the population of Belize City fled inland in cars and
government buses.
	   Mexico's Quintana Roo state began evacuating all villages in a
165-mile (275 km) swath of coastline south of Playa del Carmen.
Tourists tried to find ways out of the resorts of Cancun and
Cozumel further north.
	   At 0000 GMT, Mitch was 45 miles (70 kms) north of the Honduran
coast _ about 100 miles (160 kms) northeast of this coastal city,
according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   Hurricane-force winds extended up to 60 miles (100 kilometers)
from the center.
	   Winds dropped from 180 mph (305 kph) to near 150 mph (240 kph),
reducing Mitch from a Category 5 to a Category 4 storm. But the
hurricane remained very powerful.
	   ``Hurricane conditions are spreading onshore over Honduras and
the adjacent Bay Islands,'' the center said. ``Ham radio reports
indicate significant damage on the island of Roatan'' off the
coast.
	   Mitch was meandering late Tuesday after moving
west-southwestward roughly parallel to the coast for much of the
day.
	   ``It's moving slowly and the slower-moving the storm, the more
unpredictable it always is,'' said meteorologist Jack Beven at the
U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   Forecasters earlier said the most likely track would carry Mitch
into central Belize by early Thursday, though some models showed it
could veer southwest, northwest or even northeast if it slows
further.
	   ``With that kind of range of possibilities, we're not going to
try to pin down anything about where it's going,'' Beven said.
	   The U.S. National Weather Service said only three Atlantic
storms were stronger than Mitch at its peak: Gilbert in 1988, Allen
in 1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.
	   The entire coast of Honduras was under a hurricane warning, and
up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain was forecast in
mountainous areas. At least four large rivers had flooded.
	   President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum
alert. The government reported at least three deaths. The Red Cross
in neighboring Nicaragua said eight people died there due to
flooding due to Mitch's rains.
	   In La Ceiba, waves pounded at the walls of beachfront discos and
residents of low-lying neighborhoods waded through flooded streets
_ some carrying furniture on their backs _ to reach higher ground.
	   Fisherman Manuel Padilla said he wanted to flee with his three
children but had not been told where to seek shelter. ``Nobody has
come to see us,'' he complained. ``They've forgotten about us.''
	   The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco,
said 5,000 soldiers were ordered to help storm victims, but he
warned that the military could not reach everyone.
	   Five villages in the northeastern province of Gracias a Dios
were cut off by flooding, but police evacuated all 2,000 residents
before the rivers rose, according to the national police chief,
Col. Anael Perez. Two other villages were cut off by fallen trees.
	   Perez said more than 6,000 people were also evacuated in other
coastal areas.
	   Early Tuesday, the storm passed almost directly over Honduras'
tiny Swan Islands, used in the 1980s as a U.S. radar station and
radio base for broadcasts to Cuba.
	   Authorities said the military base lost its roof but that the
five soldiers posted there were unhurt because they took refuge in
nearby caves.
	   Belizeans weren't taking any chances. Stores and banks all were
closed in Belize City, and almost all of the city's 75,000
residents were fleeing by car or bus to higher ground.
	   A huge traffic jam _ and a heavy rain _ slowed drivers headed to
Belmopan, the Belizean capital that was built after Belize City
itself was destroyed by Hurricane Hattie in 1961.
	   All gas stations in Belize City had run out of gasoline, but the
government commandeered all buses in the country to run 24 hours a
day ferrying people inland for free.
	   The government also ordered the total evacuation of Ambergris
Cay, an island in the north of the country that is home to many
Americans and Europeans. Residents were fleeing on water taxis and
military planes, authorities said.
	   And further north in Mexico, tourists in the resorts of Cancun
and Cozumel prepared for the worst. Long lines formed at the
airport and authorities made plans to evacuate tens of thousands of
tourists if the hurricane gets closer.
	   Vacationer Allison Chapman of North Devon, England, said she had
been waiting at the airport for five hours.
	   ``We're No. 12 on the standby list _ to anywhere,'' she said.

Dollar falls, Tokyo stock prices higher in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early
Wednesday amid falling consumer confidence in the United States,
while Japanese stock prices were slightly higher.
	   The dollar bought 118.08 yen in early trading, down 1.28 yen
from late Tuesday but above its late New York rate of 117.75 yen
overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 21.59
points, or 0.16 percent, to 13,842.27 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Tuesday, the Nikkei closed down 22.78
points, or 0.16 percent.
	   In currency trading, the dollar was lower after the Conference
Board said Tuesday that consumer confidence in the United States
fell to its lowest level in nearly two years in October, traders
said.
	   That was the fourth straight month of decline in consumer
confidence, raising fears that Americans will cut back on spending

Tuesday, down 66.17.
	   On the stock market, share prices moved in a narrow range on a

Ethnic rivalries in Afghanistan making enemies of friends

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Barely 14 years old and already life
is a dilemma for Mohammed Jan.
	   A member of Afghanistan's minority Shiite Muslim community, Jan
feels his ethnic group is being targeted by the Pashtun majority.
Yet his best friend is Pashtun.
	   ``I'm worried about my people because the Taliban have killed so
many of them. ...,'' Mohammed says in halting schoolboy English.
``Now in my country it is Pashtun against Hazara, and Pashtun
against Tajik, and Uzbek against Hazara, and Uzbek against
Pashtun.''
	   When he speaks of his best friend his voice is barely a whisper.
``In my heart it hurts.''
	   The Afghan factions that have torn the country apart in years of
civil war are divided mainly along ethnic lines, and those
divisions sometimes bring merciless treatment of enemies.
	   The United Nations and Amnesty International charged that
hundreds of Afghan Shiites _ who are called Hazaras _ were
slaughtered when the Pashtun-dominated Taliban army overran the
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif in August.
	   After interviewing dozens of people who escaped from
Mazar-e-Sharif, U.N. officials accused Taliban soldiers of going on
a ``killing frenzy'' there. Taliban troops have refused to allow
journalists into Mazar-e-Sharif, saying the city is not safe.
	   The ethnic strife has increased tensions with neighboring Iran,
where Shiite Muslims are in the majority. Iran's government
recently moved 200,000 soldiers to the border, leveling charges of
``ethnic cleansing'' against the Taliban army, which controls most
of Afghanistan.
	   Taliban leaders deny their troops massacred anyone in
Mazar-e-Sharif. They accuse Iran and former Soviet states along
Afghanistan's northern border of inciting ethnic tensions to
undermine Taliban rule.
	   ``Our people are tired of fighting ... it is others who want to
keep us fighting,'' said Haji Mohammed Nawab Haideri, the Shiite
representative on the Taliban ruling council. He said the Taliban
administration does not interfere with Shiite worship or festivals.
	   U.N. investigators also have found evidence of atrocities
committed against the Taliban, such as a 1997 massacre of Taliban
troops in Mazar-e-Sharif after a temporary alliance with local
Uzbek commanders broke down. The Taliban says thousands of its men
were forced to jump into wells while Uzbeks threw in hand grenades
and shot them with rifles.
	   In an attempt to stop what he calls widespread human rights
abuses by all parties, U.N. Special Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi got a
promise in mid-October from the Taliban's reclusive leader, Mullah
Mohammed Omar, to cooperate with a commission that will investigate
allegations of abuses. The Taliban's opponents also are being asked
to participate.
	   The good neighborliness that existed between Afghanistan's
ethnic groups before Islamic insurgents swept the communists from
power has been replaced by fear.
	   ``I have built a small hiding place and when in the night there
is a knock on my door I run and hide,'' said a middle-aged man who
identified himself only as Bashir.
	   Bashir's broad face and stocky build mark him as a Tajik from
the Panjshir Valley, home of the Taliban army's biggest opponent,
Ahmed Shah Massood.
	   Minorities in Kabul say Taliban militiamen sweep through
neighborhoods in the night, pounding on doors and taking away
non-Pashtun men. Taliban officials say they are looking for weapons
and young male minorities suspected of supporting opposition
forces.
	   Young Mohammed Jan says being innocent isn't enough for the
Taliban soldiers. To avoid being jailed, young Hazaras often have
to pay bribes, he says.
	   But Hazaras and Pashtuns alike are quick to say the ethnic
discord wracking their homeland is not the making of the Taliban
army. They blame the fractious guerrilla groups that allied loosely
to drive out a Marxist regime in 1992 but couldn't work together to
form a government.
	   The Islamic guerrillas _ called mujahedeen, or holy warriors _
were grouped along ethnic lines and carved up Kabul. The Hazaras
took over the Karte Se, Dez Mazang and Pul-e-Sukh neighborhoods in
the east. Other areas were controlled by their archenemies, Pashtun
Sunni Muslims belonging to Abdur Rasoul Sayyaf's Ittehad-e-Islami
group.
	   Still other areas were held by the Tajik militia of Burhanuddin
Rabbani, Uzbek fighters led by Rashid Dostum and Pashtun followers
of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
	   Frequent battles left entire neighborhoods in ruins, until
Taliban forces captured Kabul two years ago and pushed the fighting
to the north.
	   The ethnic animosities affected civilians before the Taliban
arrived, says Ghulam Mohammed, easily recognized as a Hazara by his
Central Asian features.
	   ``If I would have gone to Sayyaf's area they would have captured
me and said, 'Give me money.' Then they would have taken my money
and killed me,'' he says. ``It's not new. It's just getting
worse.''
	   Noorullah Jan, a wealthy Pashtun businessman, is satisfied to
have the Taliban in control, at least for now. During the years
when Kabul was a battleground, he couldn't go to his shop because
it would have meant passing though an area dominated by Uzbeks.
	   ``When the communists were here, we waited for the mujahedeen,
but the mujahedeen came and we were disappointed, and now the
Taliban have come and we wait for peace,'' Jan says. ``But, for all
its problems, my country is sweet. I don't want to leave it.''

Anonymous HIV testing key to early treatment of AIDS, study finds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Anonymous screening for the AIDS virus leads to
people getting tested and treated much earlier, a study found.
	   But where name-linked testing is required _ as it is now in 11
states _ public clinics have seen no significant decline in the
number of people tested, another study found.
	   In confidential testing, the person's name is linked to test
results in a medical chart and kept on file at health departments
to prevent cases from being tracked more than once. The names are
stripped before results are sent to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. In anonymous testing, only a number is recorded
with the test result, never a name.
	   Federal authorities favor the availability of both. They say
name reporting is the only way to track the epidemic, but anonymous
testing may help curb it by getting people into treatment earlier.
	   ``The history of this disease has been a little different than
... other diseases, because we haven't had a therapy until recently
that was highly effective,'' said Dr. Allyn K. Nakashima, lead
author of one study and a CDC medical epidemiologist.
	   Public reluctance to give names to public health officials for
testing has eased, since a person's anonymity disappears when he or
she becomes a patient, she said.
	   The CDC studied about 459,000 tests at health departments in six
states before and after they implemented reporting of names of
people who tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
	   Name reporting did not appear to diminish the use of testing in
the states studied _ Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Jersey and Tennessee _ the CDC said in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
	   Name reporting has been required since 1981 in all states for
full-blown AIDS and has been routine even longer in all states for
other diseases ranging from tuberculosis to gonorrhea and
salmonella poisoning.
	   But only 11 states require name reporting of HIV-positive tests.
	   A separate study in JAMA found that where anonymous testing was
also offered as a publicly funded alternative _ as it is now in 39
states _ people who were eventually diagnosed with AIDS sought HIV
tests and HIV-related treatment much earlier than other patients.
	   HIV-related treatment averaged more than a year earlier in the
anonymous group, the study found.
	   ``That is one of the biggest (positive) effects of any public
health program anywhere,'' said the lead author, Dr. Andrew Bindman
of San Francisco General Hospital Medical Center.
	   Their study involved 835 patients in Arizona, Colorado,
Missouri, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon and Texas. North
Carolina has since mandated name reporting of HIV tests.
	   Early testing and treatment not only prolongs patients lives but
allows them to take precautions to prevent spreading the disease,
the researchers noted.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The killing of a Mexican journalist appears
to have been an act of random violence, not an attack tied to his
work, officials said Tuesday.
	   The body of Claudio Cortes Garcia, an editor for the Mexican
edition of Le Monde Diplomatique, was found Friday in the back seat
of a car. Officials said he had been strangled.
	   ``There has been no indication up to now that his murder was in
any way related to his work as a journalist,'' a spokesman at the
Mexico City attorney general's office said on customary condition
of anonymity.
	   Cortes, a Mexican, was the layout editor for the French
newspaper's Mexican edition, which resumed publication last year.
It was suspended in the mid-1980s after its then-director, Ivan
Melendez, was slain.
	   Eda Chavez, editor of the monthly publication, said Cortes also
worked as an editor for the magazine La Crisis and had earlier
worked for several other Mexican publications, including the
newspaper Reforma.
	   She said he was 32 and left a wife and a month-old son.
	   Several other journalists have been attacked in Mexico City over
the past year, but most of the cases appear to be part of the
capital's general crime wave.
	    &UR; ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's two largest opposition parties
called Tuesday for the impeachment of central bank Governor
Guillermo Ortiz, claiming he violated the law in connection with a
bank rescue program.
	   The petitions were filed Monday with the Chamber of Deputies,
the lower house of Mexico's Congress, by the conservative National
Action Party and the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party.
	   National Action charged that in his former post as treasury
secretary, Ortiz illegally pledged federal backing for bad bank
debts assumed by the state-run Deposit Protection Fund, known as
Fobaproa.
	   The federal government's proposal to formally convert Fobaproa's
552 billion pesos (dlrs 55 billion) in liabilities into part of the
national debt has been criticized by opposition parties.
	   The federal Interior Secretariat criticized the impeachment
proposal, saying it ``erroneously'' supposed the federal executive
branch acted without legal basis in taking the measures to fight an
economic crisis in 1995.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The future top security official
of one of Brazil's most developed states on Tuesday called for a
change in police officers' attitudes, saying they should not go to
work prepared to kill.
	   ``I want to change the way of thinking of police. They should
not go out with their weapons prepared to kill. They should go out
prepared to protect citizens,'' Jose Siqueira Silva, Rio's newly
appointed Secretary for Public Security, told the radio station
CBN.
	   The number of people killed by police in Rio has escalated from
an average of 16 to 32 a month in the last three years since the
beginning of a program giving officers bonues for bravery. The
government canceled the program in June.
	   Silva's comments signaled an apparent switch in policy from the
man he will shortly succeed. Noaldo Alves da Silva, a strong
supporter of the bravery program, sparked criticism recently by
saying police should shoot to kill criminals in shoot-outs.
	   Rio's governor-elect Anthony Garotinho announced Jose Siqueira
Silva's appointment after he was elected Sunday. He has yet to take
up his new post.

	   FUKUSHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Naoto Kan knows how to work a crowd. He
talks issues with clarity and precision. He's telegenic,
charismatic. And unlike many Japanese politicians, he doesn't
grease his hair.
	   But what really sets Kan apart from the powerbrokers with whom
he shares the halls Parliament is that behind his boyish smile is
the zeal of a reformer _ a proven desire to overhaul the way Japan,
Inc. does business.
	   For his ferver, Kan has over the past three years been elevated
from obscurity to become head of Japan's largest opposition party.
According to many polls, he is now the most popular politician in
the land.
	   In fact, political insiders say that if he can continue to
consolidate his still fragmented power base he may even be in
position one day to challenge Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, whose
support ratings are as sickly as Japan's recession-bound economy.
	   ``Japan needs a real political alternative, like him,'' said
Kodo Kobata, a veteran lawmaker, as he watched Kan impress a
capacity crowd at an auditorium in this northern Japanese city
during a recent speaking tour.
	   The 52-year-old lawyer has made his name by taking on the elite
ministries where the important decisions of state have long been
made in back rooms out of the public view.
	   Working hand-in-hand with big business, Japan's bureaucrats led
the country out of its postwar poverty to growth rates that were
the envy of the world.
	   But Kan and many economists say the same secretive, cozy links
that once helped Japan dominate world markets are now bogging down
its economy in inefficiency and corruption.
	   ``Japan's system was designed for the problems of a developing
nation, not a developed one,'' Kan told another crowd in Fukushima.
	   Kan isn't the first to try to rein in the bureaucracy. Reformist
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa unsuccessfully butted heads with
officials during his short-lived administration in 1993.
International-minded former central bank Gov. Haruo Maekawa called
for curtailing the ministries' powers a dozen years ago _ and was
brushed aside.
	   But analysts say Kan's chances of success are better, partly
because of the general feeling of gloom and impatience generated by
a nagging recession and record-high unemployment.
	   A more important factor, however, may be Kan's personal savvy.
	   Though most lawmakers are either ex-bureaucrats or sit in seats
inherited from their fathers, Kan is a bone fide outsider.
	   The son of a middle-class Tokyo engineer, Kan got his start in
politics in the 1970s as a volunteer consumer activist and then
became campaign manager for a well-known feminist lawmaker.
	   He won his first seat in Parliament in 1980 on the ticket of a
little-known opposition group and then grabbed the national
spotlight in 1996, when as health minister he exposed ministry
bureaucrats for covering up the sale of HIV-tainted blood.
	   ``Kan put in long hours to change the way the bureaucrats
operated,'' said Tomiko Okazaki, a member of Kan's Democratic
Party.
	   Since forming the party two years ago, he has repeatedly topped
opinion polls as the voters' No. 1 pick to lead the country.
	   But Kan still faces an uphill road to the prime minister's
office. Despite a stunning victory in summer elections, the
Democrats remain a small minority in the lower house of Parliament,
where the prime minister is chosen. New elections aren't likely for
another two years.
	   And while Kan's party has tried to set itself apart from other
opposition groups with a simple message of shrinking government, it
relies on a fragmented power base _ urban white collar voters,
unionists and farmers _ bonded only by a shared disgust with ruling
party scandals.
	   Kan draws his share of criticism as well.
	   He's been labeled a grandstander, and many in his own party
gripe about his dictatorial ways.
	   Still, impatience with the status quo is high, and no politician
in Japan can match Kan's popular appeal, a fact Kan knows _ and
exploits _ well.
	   ``If the Democratic Party fails, there won't be another chance
to replace the LDP for another 10 years,'' he told his audience.
``The time is now.''

NATO keeps up its guard in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO is promising to keep up its
guard to make sure Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic sticks by
the agreement to defuse the Kosovo crisis and encourage tens of
thousands of ethnic Albanians to return to their homes.
	   The 16-nation military alliance decided Tuesday that more than
400 NATO warplanes would remain on alert despite Milosevic's
withdrawal of thousands of Serb police from the southern Serb
province by Tuesday's 1900 GMT deadline.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said at a news conference
after a 2 1/2-hour meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels,
Belgium, that he welcomed the compliance and hoped it would open up
the possibility for political discussions.
	   ``This crisis is far from over,'' Solana said. ``I urge both
sides to take advantage of the opportunity that now exists to move
the political process forward and to secure this unique opportunity
to work for a better future for Kosovo.''
	   NATO also issued a statement calling on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo to comply with U.N. resolutions and ``maintain the
cease-fire they have declared.''
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and
most want independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
NATO would move quickly to use force against Yugoslavia if
Milosevic sends troops and special police back to Kosovo to
threaten ethnic Albanian civilians.
	   Albright said the NATO allies were preparing to organize a
rapid-reaction force to be based in the neighboring former Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia, which could intervene quickly if Milosevic
sends troops against civilians again.
	   International officials hope the continued pressure will
encourage many of the 300,000 displaced people to return to the
homes they were forced to flee when fighting between rebel
Albanians and Serb security forces escalated earlier this year.
	   Hugh Parmer of the U.S. Agency for International Development
visited a number of Kosovo villages and towns on his first trip to
Kosovo in seven weeks.
	   ``The biggest difference is the hope I saw in the peoples' eyes
now compared to the fear I saw seven weeks ago,'' he said. ``It is
still a difficult situation, but if these people go home we will
have a manageable humanitarian situation. There should be no deaths
in the winter.''
	   Many of the displaced people are camping in the woods and hills
of the predominately ethnic Albanian province, fearful that Serb
police would shoot at them if the tried to go back to their homes.
	   Diplomatic observers reported that as many as 4,100 Serb
policemen pulled out of Kosovo on Monday alone. Neither the
observers nor Associated Press reporters saw any roadblocks or
checkpoints anywhere they traveled in the province on Tuesday.
	   Among the demands made by American negotiator Richard Holbrooke
in his Oct. 12 peace deal with Milosevic was a reduction of troops
and police in Kosovo to levels of last February when fighting broke
out between government forces and the independence-seeking Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   ``We have observed what I would consider significant reductions
in the Serbian police presence in the field,'' said Shaun Byrnes,
head of the American section of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission, spearhead of what eventually will be 2,000 ``ground
verifiers'' who will make sure that Milosevic is living up to his
promises.
	   In the village of Ostrozub, southwest of the provincial capital
of Pristina, Avdullah Krasniqi, an ethnic Albanian, loaded his farm
wagon with his wife, kids and household goods and headed home
Tuesday.
	   He said he made his decision less out of confidence that NATO
had forced an end to the crisis than the fact that it was getting
colder by the day in his mountain refuge.
	   ``We spent three months in the mountains,'' Krasniqi said in a
roadside conversation as family members sat in a wagon on a huge
pile of carpets, kitchen utensils and other household goods, all
pulled by the family tractor. ``It's very cold.''
	   The Krasniqis wanted very badly to go home, but they were still
wary.
	   ``We don't have any faith in Milosevic,'' he said, licking his
thick, dark moustache and recalling that his next-door neighbor was
shot to death on his doorstep.

Hong Kong observatory detects earthquake on Indonesian islands

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An earthquake rumbled through some remote
Indonesian islands early Wednesday, but there were no immediate
reports of damage, Hong Kong weather officials said.
	   The earthquake, estimated at a magnitude of 5.9, was centered
near the island of Halmahera, about 1,150 miles (2,500 kms) east of
Jakarta.
	   Although there were no immediate indications of damage,
earthquakes of that magnitude can be destructive.
	   The Hong Kong Observatory said its seismographs detected the
``intense'' earthquake, centered about 160 miles (260 kms)
northeast of Ternate, in the Moluccas, at 5:21 a.m. Hong Kong time
(2121 GMT Tuesday).

Japanese industrial production figures show slight improvement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade ministry said Wednesday that
industrial output at Japanese factories and mines climbed a
seasonally-adjusted 2.5 percent in September on the month, marking
a slight improvement which beat many economists' expectations.
	   In its assessment of the latest industrial production figures,
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said output was
``stagnant,'' an improvement from the ``downtrend'' which had
characterized the previous six months.
	   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires estimated industrial
production would grow only 2.1 percent in September compared to the
previous month. The government had predicted a 3.0 percent rise.
	   But MITI does not expect a continued surge in output. Rather, it
forecast a 1.1 percent decline in industrial production this month
followed by a 0.3 percent drop in November.
	   The ministry also reported retail sales at major department
stores and supermarkets fell for a fifth consecutive month,
dropping 5.2 percent on the year to 1.68 trillion yen (dlrs 14
billion) in September.
	   Sales declined in all categories except for food and beverages,
which saw a 0.9 percent gain, MITI said. Clothing sales sank 12.7
percent and sales of autos fell 6.8 percent, it said.
	   Also Wednesday, the Bank of Japan reported wholesale prices
during the second 10 days of October fell 1.3 percent compared to
the previous 10-day period and were 2.8 percent lower than during
the middle portion of the month a year ago.

Argentine president arrives in Britain for reconciliation visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Vowing reconciliation to heal the wounds of the
1982 Falklands War, Carlos Menem has begun a six-day official visit
as the first Argentine president to travel to Britain since the
countries battled over the south Atlantic archipelago.
	   Both the Argentine and British governments have stressed that
Menem's visit is for reconciliation, not recrimination, over the
conflict, which started when Argentina's then-military junta
invaded islands populated by 2,200 people of British descent.
	   Britain won the islands, known in Argentina as The Malvinas,
back in a 74-day war in which 970 people died, including 255
British soldiers.
	   On his first day of official business, Menem was scheduled to
meet business leaders for breakfast Wednesday, then attend a
reconciliation service at St. Paul's Cathedral and lay a wreath for
those killed in the Falklands War.
	   In a letter to a British tabloid on Friday, Menem stopped short
of an apology but said he deeply regretted the war and that it
``should never have happened.''
	   Argentina has not renounced its claim to the islands, and Menem
has said he would like them returned to Argentina by 2000.
	   ``Both sides will state their position and I think we have a
duty to the Falkland islanders to make it clear that sovereignty is
not up for negotiation,'' said Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
	   ``President Menem at the time was in prison, where he was held
for five years and tortured under that same regime. The fact that
he is the president of Argentina shows how far it has come,'' Cook
said.
	   In addition to improving political ties, Menem has brought 100
of Argentina's top business leaders with him in an attempt to boost
commercial relations with Britain.
	   Menem also is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Tony Blair
and Queen Elizabeth II during his visit.
	   His jet landed at London's Heathrow Airport Tuesday with the
Argentine flag and Britain's Union Jack flying outside the cockpit.

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Gymnast Dominique Moceanu and her parents
apparently settled their differences with an agreement that would
give the Olympic star the independence she has sought.
	   One week after the 17-year-old gold medalist ran away from home
and sued her parents, both sides agreed Tuesday to allow her to be
declared a legal adult.
	   David Gray, an attorney with the law office representing
Moceanu, said her parents have dropped their resistance to having
her declared a legal adult and that an agreement would be presented
Wednesday to a family court judge.
	   A statement released by Moceanu and her parents stated: ``The
parties have met amongst themselves and as a family unit have
resolved their differences. It is anticipated that an agreement
will be submitted to Judge John Montgomery for approval.''
	   There was no answer Tuesday night at the home of Moceanu's
parents, and private attorneys for both sides declined further
comment.
	   Ellen Yarrell, an attorney appointed to guard Moceanu's rights,
said the agreement ``is in her best interest'' but declined to
elaborate.
	   The announcement came after the gymnast and her parents met
face-to-face for several hours Tuesday in their first meeting since
she left home and filed a lawsuit demanding to be declared a legal
adult so she could get answers about how her earnings are being
spent.
	   Last week, Moceanu's parents responded by asking a judge to
dismiss the lawsuit and a temporary restraining order against them.
A hearing had been scheduled Wednesday over their request, but
Moceanu's lawyer, Roy Moore, said the agreement would be presented
instead.
	   Under the agreement, all restraining orders have been removed,
Moore said.
	   Moceanu's parents had alleged in court documents that her coach
and two others convinced their daughter to run away.
	   But the gymnast had insisted that no one influenced her, saying
she simply wanted answers about how the money she earned in her
seven-year career was being spent, primarily by her father, Dumitru
Moceanu.
	   Moceanu said she believed her father had squandered much of the
money to build a gymnasium in the Houston suburb of Spring.
	   According to Yarrell, the trust is structured so that Moceanu
won't gain control over the assets until she turns 35. But if the
Moceanus' parental rights are severed, she might be able to gain
access to the funds early, Yarrell said.
	   It's unclear how much money, if any, remains in the trust.

British travel advisory for Chile as Pinochet hearing wraps up
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain has advised its citizens to avoid
``non-essential'' travel to Chile, warning they could become
targets of violence there in the wake of the arrest in London of
former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   The Foreign Office said anti-British feeling is running high in
Chile since British authorities arrested Pinochet Oct. 16 on a
warrant from a Spanish magistrate seeking his extradition to Spain
to face charges of murder, torture and kidnappings during his
17-year rule.
	   Lawyers for prosecutors and Pinochet argued their cases Monday
and Tuesday in a court hearing on Pinochet's application for
immediate release. A ruling was expected Wednesday afternoon.
	   Lawyers for the 82-year-old Pinochet contended that the Spanish
warrant was illegal both because former heads of state cannot be
prosecuted for actions committed in their ``official capacity'' and
because he is not Spanish.
	   But attorneys representing Spanish prosecutors argued that under
international law, Pinochet is liable to stand trial for human
rights abuses committed while he was in office.
	   Abuses committed by a ruler are not ``something that is in the
furtherance of his function as head of state,'' said Alun Jones,
who also represents British prosecutors.
	   Jones alleged that Pinochet was responsible for up to 4,000
murders, including at least one in the United States, and had sent
agents to Spain to ``seek out and kill'' political opponents there.
	   Meanwhile, fearing the British government will release the
Pinochet on humanitarian grounds, four Chilean exiles who say they
were tortured by his secret police launched a legal bid to have him
tried in Britain.
	   Similar filings were being pursued in Switzerland, Sweden and
France.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook reiterated that the government does
not intend to intervene. ``Due process of law must be carried out
and it must not be warped to fit anybody's political agenda,'' he
told Parliament.
	   The general was under guard in a London hospital, where he is
recovering from an Oct. 9 back operation. Chilean Senator Francisco
Prat, in London to support Pinochet, told a Santiago radio station
that the general will be transferred, probably to a private
apartment, in the next day because the hospital complained of
problems caused by his presence.
	   In its travel advisory, the Foreign Office called the situation
in Chile ``volatile'' and warned of isolated attacks on people
``mistakenly identified as British.''
	   British nationals and British commercial interests could become
``targets of mob violence,'' it cautioned, and Britons should
``keep a low profile,'' according to the advisory.
	   The travel warning caused some surprise in Chile because
authorities said no crimes targeting British citizens have been
reported. Officials of the Chilean-British Culture Institute in
Santiago confirmed receiving insulting telephone calls, but refused
to comment further.
	   Several people, virtually all Chilean according to the Chilean
government, were receiving police protection after receiving
threats by mail or telephone in connection with the Pinochet
arrest. Socialist Sen. Carlos Ominami, who acknowledged receiving
threats, said ``this is a campaign to spread terror and fear, but
it will not succeed.''
	   Chilean Deputy Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez, also in
London to seek Pinochet's release, said the travel warning was
``not the best way to avoid the political escalation of this
situation.''
	   It was ``giving the way for the interpretation that you are
facing almost a political conflict. This is not our view,'' he
said.
	   Earlier, to protest Pinochet's detention, two Chilean admirals
called off a trip to negotiate the possible purchase of three
British warships.
	   The visit was ``felt by the Chileans to be inappropriate in the
circumstances,'' a Defense Ministry spokesman told The Associated
Press, speaking anonymously.
	   In Spain, Judge Baltasar Garzon, who instigated the arrest,
rejected appeals against the warrant made last week by Eduardo
Fungarino, chief prosecutor of the National Court to which Garzon
is also attached.
	   Garzon has issued a new extradition warrant alleging an
unspecified number of murders, tortures and kidnappings up to 1992,
two years after Pinochet stood down. He remained commander-in-chief
of the Chilean army until March.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Holed up like a hermit in her apartment on the Rue
de Savoie, refusing to see even her good friends, the aging Dora
Maar spent the years before her death in illness and poverty.
	   But the woman who was Pablo Picasso's dark-haired muse for eight
passionate years was surrounded by glory: paintings, drawings,
sketches, notes, cards, photos and countless other mementos of her
years with the master.
	   That treasure trove, which she refused to part with _ even when
she needed money _ is on the auction block this week. Her friends
say Maar, who died in 1997, wouldn't be happy.
	   ``Dora wanted her things to go to the church,'' said John
Richardson, a collector and friend. ``But she left only a 1958 will
that named only monks, now dead. How silly.''
	   Another close friend, James Lord, said Maar ``would be just
horrified at all this.''
	   ``All this stuff was so personal to her,'' he said. ``It's
rather morbid to have it up for sale.''
	   Picasso's granddaughter, Diana Widmaier, agreed.
	   ``Some of these private things should never have gone on the
market,'' she said.
	   Whatever Maar's wishes, the auction has given art lovers a rare
chance to examine the minutiae of an affair _ from the goofy
postcards to the tiny drawings on matchbooks to a doodle on a
restaurant menu.
	   The three-day auction, which began Tuesday, was expected to
raise up to dlrs 70 million. The first evening, focusing on oil
paintings and drawings, saw sky-high prices for drawings but lower
than expected prices for some of the paintings.
	   But it is the deeply personal, slice-of-life nature of the
collection that had Parisians standing in the rain to get a
pre-auction glimpse at the Maison de la Chimie near the Eiffel
Tower.
	   Dora Maar was 29, the dark-haired daughter of a Yugoslav
architect and a French mother, when she met Picasso in 1936. She
quickly became his lover and his model.
	   But in the 1940s, Picasso moved on to the younger Francoise
Gilot, and Maar went into a tailspin.
	   Though she appeared to have no heirs, genealogists tracked down
two distant relatives, both of whom had never even heard of Maar.
Now, after the government takes 60 percent of the proceeds for
taxes, those relatives will get much of the remaining 40 percent.
	   The big-ticket items Tuesday were 10 oil paintings, including
seven of Dora herself. The highest price, 37 million francs (dlrs
6,642,729) went for the 1937 ``The Crying Woman (Study for
Guernica)'' _ in which Dora's eyes are turned into tears pierced
with long pins.
	   Yet the favorite of many, ``Dora Maar with Green Nails,''
fetched a disappointing 23 million francs (dlrs 4,129,264.) The
1936 tableau shows the muse at the height of her style, her chin
resting on green-painted nails and hair braided on top of her head.
	   The evening's big success was the drawings, especially ``Dora
with Undone Hair,'' which went for 5 million francs (dlrs 897,666).
	   But the most fascinating objects, to go on sale later this week,
are the smallest: little portraits of Dora made into jewelry,
little instruments made from the silver wrapping around a wine
cork, dozens of sketches on tiny matchbook covers, photographs of
the dashing Picasso at all ages, original books, notes, postcards,
and letters.
	   Nothing, it seems, was too small or insignificant for Picasso to
scrawl on. One matchbook says: ``It was so dark at noon that the
stars could be seen.'' A restaurant menu is adorned with a
whimsical self-portrait of the artist.
	   And perhaps the oddest but most poignant item from this lover's
cache: a scrap of paper with a brownish stain, and the scrawled
words, ``Blood of Picasso.''

	   FUKUSHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Naoto Kan knows how to work a crowd. He
talks issues with clarity and precision. He's telegenic,
charismatic. And unlike many Japanese politicians, he doesn't
grease his hair.
	   But what really sets Kan apart from the powerbrokers with whom
he shares the halls Parliament is that behind his boyish smile is
the zeal of a reformer _ a proven desire to overhaul the way Japan,
Inc. does business.
	   For his fervor, Kan has over the past three years been elevated
from obscurity to become head of Japan's largest opposition party.
According to many polls, he is now the most popular politician in
the land.

U.N. says world is ageing and AIDS is cutting life expectancy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ As the 21st century approaches, the world
is ageing rapidly, couples are having fewer children, and AIDS is
taking such a ``devastating toll'' in Africa that life expectancy
is decreasing instead of increasing, according to U.N. population
estimates released Wednesday.
	   Even though fertility is continuing to decline in much of the
world, global population is expected to climb to 6 billion in 1999
_ and the AIDS epidemic will not reverse Africa's population
growth, the U.N. Population Division said.
	   Last year, AIDS killed 2.3 million adults and children, and 30
million people are currently infected by the HIV virus. According
to the U.N. figures, 91 percent of AIDS deaths occurred in 34
countries, 29 in sub-Sahara Africa.
	   But in the 29 African countries hardest-hit by AIDS, the
population will remain the same or continue climbing because
fertility in these countries is high, according to the U.N.
estimates.
	   The continuing spread of AIDS is nonetheless having serious
population repercussions: children born today in those 29 African
countries will have an average life expectancy of 47 years rather
than 54 years if there had not been an AIDS epidemic, the U.N.
said.
	   And the demographic impact ``is expected to intensify in the
future,'' especially in the nine African countries where more than
10 percent of the adult population has the HIV virus _ Botswana,
Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Zambia
and Zimbabwe, it said.
	   ``By 2010-2015, the average life expectancy at birth in these
countries could be only 47 years. In the absence of AIDS, it would
have been expected to reach 63 years. This represents 16 years of
life expectancy lost to AIDS,'' the U.N. said.
	   The population estimates and projections are prepared every two
years by the Population Division of the United Nations Department
of Economic and Social Affairs. The figures are used throughout the
United Nations system.
	   According to the new estimates, world population stood at 5.9
billion in mid-1998, and was growing by 1.33 percent per year, an
average of 78 million people. Countries adding the most population
were India, China, Pakistan, Indonesia, Nigeria, the United States,
Brazil, Bangladesh, Mexico and the Philippines.
	   The 1995-2000 population growth rate is significantly less that
the peak growth rate of 2.04 percent in 1965-70, and less than the
rate of 1.46 percent in 1990-95, the U.N. said.
	   Depending on future fertility trends, the world's population in
2050 is projected to be in the range of 7.3 billion to 10.7
billion, it said.
	   Africa has the highest population growth rate of all major
regions of the world _ 2.36 percent. And during the last two years,
Africa's population, now 749 million, surpassed Europe's, which is
currently 729 million, the U.N. said.
	   In contrast, Europe has the lowest growth rate, just 0.03
percent, and in Eastern Europe the rate is minus 0.2 percent,
indicating a population decline, it said.
	   The developed world has led the process of population ageing
since the beginning of the 20th century _ and Europe is most
affected. The proportion of older people in Europe will increase
from 20 percent in 1998 to 35 percent in 2050, the U.N. said.
	   For the first time, U.N. experts estimated the number of people
in their 80s, 90s and over 100 _ and found 66 million people over
80 including 6.4 million over 90 and 135,000 centinarians.
	   ``With the continuation of fertility decline and increase in
life expectancy, the population of the world will age much faster
in the next half-century than previously,'' the U.N. said.

Canadian walks 3,000 miles across Australia; then cools her heels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Cheered on by 50 local schoolchildren
as she dipped her feet in the South Pacific Ocean, 31-year-old
Canadian Deanna Sorensen completed Wednesday a six-month,
3,000-mile (5,000-kilometer) walk across Australia.
	   ``I'm just so glad it's over, the feeling is undescribable,''
the former Brampton, Ontario, resident said after reaching North
Bondi beach in Sydney. Moments later, she popped open a bottle of
champagne to celebrate the end of the journey.
	   ``It's a beautiful day here, and one that I'll never forget,''
said Sorensen, wearing a T-shirt with the words ``Mission
Possible'' on the back.
	   Sorensen, who completed the marathon trip from Perth, on
Australia's west coast to Sydney on its east, without a support
crew _ she pushed her supplies in a purple three-wheel
``baby-jogger'' _ was met at the finish by beachgoers and officials
from Australia's RSPCA, the animal welfare charity group she chose
to help raise funds for on her trip.
	   During the trip, she asked onlookers to send donations to local
animal shelters and raised hundreds of dollars from passing drivers
to be passed along to the RSPCA.
	   Sorensen, who left Perth on May 2 said a bright orange safety
vest given to her by a road worker about 60 miles (100 kilometers)
into her journey helped keep her visible to drivers.
	   ``(The road worker) saw me and gave me a safety vest belonging
to his mate who was off sick for the day. I had a few close calls
with cars _ nothing dramatic _ and I think the vest made the
difference,'' she said.
	   She said she had some ``incredible private moments'' during her
walk across the vast and arid Nullarbor plain in south-central
Australia, but the highlight was crossing the Victoria-New South
Wales state border because she knew she was only 310 miles (500
kilometers) from her destination.
	   She also claims to have seen a world record amount of road kill.
	   ``I saw loads of dead things _ emus, kangaroos, snakes, goannas
(lizards) and even a few camels by the side of the road,'' said
Sorensen. ``It was the live snakes I started seeing near the end of
the trip that concerned me.''
	   Sorensen averaged about 25 miles (40 kilometers) a day.
	   She decided to make the walk as a personal challenge, and plans
to write a book about it. Sorensen said she plans to migrate to
Australia.
	   Her trip took her east from Perth to Kalgoorlie, across the
Nullarbor and into South Australia. After leaving the state
capital, Adelaide, she took a southern highway along the coast.
	   Now, Sorensen and her English boyfriend, Jez Ford, 34, will
retrace her route in reverse. But this time she'll drive.

Islanders edge Kings 1-0; Rangers-Sabres play scoreless tie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Tommy Salo stopped 20 shots for his
third shutout of the season and Joe Sacco scored in the third
period as the New York Islanders beat the Los Angeles Kings 1-0
Tuesday night.
	   Sacco's goal, his first of the season, came at 2:01 of the final
period. After taking two strides over the red line, Sacco fired a
slap shot toward Kings goalie Manny Legace. The puck bounced in
front of the crease and went through the goalie's pads.
	   Salo, who has played in all eight games for New York this
season, also has shutouts against Tampa Bay and St. Louis. He got a
break when an apparent tying goal was disallowed with 6:15 left in
the game because the net came loose before the puck crossed the
goal line.
 &UR; Rangers 0, Sabres 0
	   In New York, Dominik Hasek, with help from both his defense and
goal posts, extended his shutout streak against New York to four
games as the Buffalo Sabres and Rangers played to a scoreless tie.
	   Hasek and Rangers goaltender Mike Richter were both flawless,
but Hasek only had to face 16 shots while posting the 35th shutout
of his National Hockey League career. Hasek also was lucky as three
New York shots hit the posts.
	   The Rangers squandered many good chances against Hasek, who has
held them scoreless since Wayne Gretzky scored at 6:14 of the third
period in a 3-3 tie at Buffalo on Nov. 28, 1997. Hasek extended his
shutout string against the Rangers to 263 minutes and 46 seconds.
	   Richter made several spectacular stops in gaining his 19th
career shutout and helping the Rangers extend their unbeaten streak
to five (2-0-3) after starting the season 0-4-0.
 &UR; Flyers 2, Blues 1
	   In Philadelphia, Colin Forbes deflected a nonchalant shot by Dan
McGillis 28 seconds into the second period for the decisive goal,
and John Vanbiesbrouck made 30 saves as the Philadelphia Flyers
beat the St. Louis Blues.
	   The Atlantic-leading Flyers won for the first time in three
games after losing to New Jersey and tying the Rangers on Saturday.
Outshot for the first time this season and held to 1-for-9 on the
power play, they relied on a stellar performance by Vanbiesbrouck.
	   Forbes broke a 1-1 tie with his third goal of the season right
after a faceoff early in the third. His weight on the wrong foot,
McGillis casually dumped the puck toward the goal, and Forbes
tipped it through Jamie McLennan's pads for a 2-1 lead.

 &UR; EDs: LEADS with details throughout, including plane landing,
reports that captain staged hijacking, higher number of people said
to be aboard, adding background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ An Air China jet with 104 people aboard
was hijacked to Taiwan on Wednesday, reportedly by an airline
captain who brought his wife and young son on the flight as he
tried to escape an unhappy life.
	   Flight CA905 took off from Beijing to the southern Chinese city
of Kunming, but it was diverted in the air and arrived at the
Taipei international airport at 11:17 a.m. (0317 GMT,) officials
said.
	   The state radio cited unnamed officials as saying the hijacker
of the Boeing 737 was suspected to be the captain, who apparently
was unhappy with his job. There was no official confirmation of the
report and details remained scarce.
	   There was a spate of hijackings from China to Taiwan in 1993 and
1994 by Chinese who said they were seeking freedom and better job
prospects.
	   Before the long-standing tensions between Taiwan and mainland
China eased in the 1980s, Taiwan treated hijackers from China
leniently, and even showered them with gold and cash rewards.
	   But the 16 hijackers arrested in the 1990s have all been jailed
for up to 10 years. Two of them were paroled and sent back to
China.
	   Hijackings in the opposite direction, from Taiwan to the
mainland, have been rare.

Japanese oil companies merge to create country's largest
</HEADLINE>
distributor
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES story slugged BC-Japan-Merger from previous cycle.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nippon Oil Co. and Mitsubishi Oil Co., two of
Japan's largest petroleum distributors and refiners, said Wednesday
they will merge next April to create Japan's largest oil company.
	   Triggered by recent deregulation which has eroded profits
throughout the industry, the partnership is designed to trim costs
and bolster competitiveness with foreign and domestic rivals.
	   The new company, to be called Nisseki Mitsubishi Co., will boast
sales of 3 trillion yen (dlrs 25.4 billion) and an industry-leading
24 percent share of the domestic fuel market.
	   The current top-ranked firm, privately-held Idemitsu Kosan Co.,
has a 16 percent market share.
	   Nippon Oil is Japan's second-largest petroleum distributor,
while Mitsubishi Oil ranks sixth.
	   In addition to having nationwide distribution networks, both
companies also refine oil and produce petrochemical products.
	   No immediate job cuts were planned, the companies said.
	   Nippon Oil president Hidejiro Ohsawa will become the president
of the new company while Mitsubishi Oil president Yoshihiko
Izumitani will be the chairman.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in the two companies'
shares during the morning session, but said the temporary ban would
be lifted for the afternoon trading session.
	   An official merger contract between the two companies is
expected to be signed by the end of this year and submitted to
shareholders for approval, the companies said.
	   One Mitsubishi Oil share will be exchanged for a 0.525 share of
Nippon Oil.
	   Some traders expected the market to react positively to the
news.
	   ``The merger will complement each company's business weakness,
and this should be welcomed,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager at
Ryoko Securities Co. ``While Mitsubishi Oil is weaker in marketing,
it is stronger in oil development and refining.''
	   Many oil firms have posted red ink due to lower demand in a
recession-hit economy and a plunge in retail gasoline prices
following the lifting of a ban on imported fuel in early 1996.
	   The changes in the industry have led analysts to expect further
moves toward consolidation among Japan's 13 main oil distributors.
	   Nippon Oil and Mitsubishi Oil have been cooperating since 1984
in areas such as jointly supplying each other with products, the
Nihon Keizai business daily reported.

Toyota, Exxon agree to develop reduced-emissions autos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. and Exxon Corp. of the
United States will jointly develop automotive systems designed to
reduce emissions and improve efficiency, Toyota said Wednesday.
	   The two companies will develop internal combustion engines and
hybrid gas-electric engines, and also the fuels and lubricants that
the new engines will require, Toyota said in a release.
	   ``In the short term, our goal is to reduce emissions. Our
long-term goal is to develop more efficient, next-generation power
sources,'' said Toyota's Vice Executive President Akihiro Wada.
	   Bill Innes, President of Exxon Research and Engineering company,
said improving the ``performance of hydrocarbons in low emission
vehicles is one of our key business priorities.''

 &UR; Undersea earthquake rocks Indonesian islands; no injuries, damage
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new data from Indonesian seismologists; AMENDS
size, location of quake; CHANGES dateline

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An undersea earthquake rumbled some
remote Indonesian islands early Wednesday, but there were no
immediate reports of injuries or damage, seismologists said.
	   The magnitude 5.2 earthquake had an epicenter 399 kilometers
(250 miles) north of Bitung on Sulawesi island, Indonesia's
Meteorology and Geophysics Bureau said.
	   It was recorded at 4:16 a.m. local time (2116 GMT Tuesday) and
rocked parts of neighboring Halmahera island, including the main
town of Ternate.
	   It was also felt in Bitung, 2,100 kilometers (1,300 miles)
northeast of Jakarta), as well as other parts of north Sulawesi.
	   A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage if
centered near an urban area.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which lies astride the
so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' _ a line of volcanically active
areas that stretches from North America across to Japan, through
Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and New Zealand.

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ An Air China jet with 104 people aboard
was hijacked to Taiwan on Wednesday, reportedly by the disgruntled
airline captain, who brought his wife on the flight as he tried to
escape an unhappy life.
	   Flight CA905 took off from Beijing to the southern Chinese city
of Kunming, but arrived safely under military jet escort at the
Taipei international airport at 11:17 a.m. (0317 GMT,) officials
said.
	   Taiwan Television showed the captain, whom it identified as Yuan
Bin, in his uniformed white shirt and with a suitcase, being
escorted out of the plane by policemen in helmets and bullet-proof
vests.
	   No passengers were hurt, according to radio and television
reports.
	   A state radio report cited unnamed officials as saying the
captain diverted his own jet to Taiwan because he apparently was
unhappy with his job. Early reports indicated he had brought a
young son along, but state radio later reported only the captain's
wife had accompanied him.
	   There was no official confirmation of his identity, and details
of the incident remained scarce.
	   Defense Ministry officials said the Boeing 737 jetliner was
escorted to the airport by four Taiwanese warplanes, which took off
after spotting the aircraft on radar.
	   There was a spate of hijackings from China to Taiwan in 1993 and
1994 by Chinese who said they were seeking freedom and better job
prospects.
	   Before long-standing tensions between Taiwan and mainland China
eased in the 1980s, Taiwan treated hijackers from China leniently,
and even showered them with gold and cash rewards.
	   But the 16 hijackers arrested in the 1990s have all been jailed
for up to 10 years. Two of them were paroled and sent back to
China.
	   Hijackings in the opposite direction, from Taiwan to the
mainland, have been rare.

Tamil journalist released on bail after 3-month detention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A Tamil journalist imprisoned for
three months for his alleged involvement with separatist Tamil
Tiger rebels has been released on 2,000 rupees (dlrs 30) bail, his
colleagues said Wednesday.
	   A Colombo magistrate on Tuesday released S. Srigajan, who was
ordered to appear in court Nov. 2 for a final hearing.
	   Police detained Srigajan and another Tamil journalist, P.
Manickkavasagam, in July on suspicion that the two had links to the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the main guerrilla group fighting
for an independent Tamil homeland in the country's north and the
east. Rebels say Tamils are discriminated against in predominately
Sinhalese Sri Lanka.
	   Both journalists work for the Colombo-based Tamil-language
Virakesari newspaper.
	   Their detention sparked protests by Sri Lankan journalists and
international media freedom organizations.
	   Manickkavasagam, who also contributes to British news agency
Reuters and the British Broadcasting Corporation, was released Aug.
10 after police failed to bring any charges.
	   The government in June imposed censorship on war reporting after
the military intensified its campaign against the LTTE. Military
news remains subject to censorship.

Flights at Tokyo's Haneda airport grounded due to communication
</HEADLINE>
trouble &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Flights to and from Tokyo's Haneda airport were
grounded for an hour Wednesday morning after a key communications
line failed, a government official said.
	   All domestic flights at Haneda were suspended shortly after
10:00 a.m. (0100 GMT), when the dedicated line between air traffic
controllers and aircraft in flight went dead, said Hiromi Tsuruwa
of the operations and flight inspection division with the Transport
Ministry.
	   Takeoffs and landings at Haneda resumed about one hour later
after airport authorities switched to a general telephone line.
	   Radio communications on the ground at the airport also failed
temporarily, Tsuruwa said.
	   Flights from several airports in Osaka and western Japan were
also affected by the trouble, national broadcaster NHK said.
	   The failure occurred in a junction cable at the Osaka facility
of Japan's telecommunications' giant NTT, the broadcaster said.
	   The trouble also caused some problems with bank cash-dispensers
and emergency calls to police in western Japan, Kyodo News said.
