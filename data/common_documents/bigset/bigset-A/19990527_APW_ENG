<HEADLINE> Avalanche Scorers Remain Silent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Derian Hatcher, a rugged defenseman with stubble  
that would demand a sharp razor, has drawn the arduous task of 
shadowing high-scoring, hard-hitting center Peter Forsberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The early results couldn't be better for the Dallas Stars, who  
have effectively contained Forsberg and Colorado's potent offense 
to take a 2-1 series lead over the Avalanche in the Western 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether I wanted the assignment or not, I got it,'' Hatcher  
said Thursday. ``I would rather play against the other lines. ... 
He is one of the harder guys in the league to defend. He is so 
strong on his skates. You can't knock him down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher's work in Dallas' 3-0 victory Wednesday night followed  
two games of grinding by teammate Guy Carbonneau, who actually 
asked to go head-to-head with Forsberg in the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Avalanche have the last line change at home,  
Carbonneau was not able to match up on Forsberg, leaving the task 
to Hatcher. The assignment will be the same for Game 4 Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God we've got a guy like Derian on our team,'' Dallas  
center Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``He's a big strong guy, too. You can 
only try to contain Forsberg. You're not going stop him all the 
time. He's just too good for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forsberg, who leads all playoff scorers with 20 points, had a  
goal and an assist in Game 1, but has been held to one assist in 
the last two games -- both Colorado losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of recent scoring punch from Forsberg and captain Joe  
Sakic prompted Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy to issue some tough 
love after Wednesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, never one to mince words, said Nieuwendyk and Mike Modano  
were simply outplaying Forsberg and Sakic. Sakic, who scored 39 
goals in the regular season, has just one in Colorado's last 10 
playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's right on,'' Sakic said when told of Roy's comment. ``It's  
not that we're not working hard, but we're not scoring. I know my 
role, and I have to put the puck in the net for us to be 
successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's just the start for the Avalanche, who turned the puck  
over 23 times in Game 3 and rarely challenged Dallas goaltender Ed 
Belfour on rebounds in front of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Eddie had a very easy game in Game 3,'' Roy said.  
``He could have sat in a chair. I think we have to make it tougher 
on him like they did on me in Game 2 and Game 3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's impossible to predict how the Avalanche will respond to  
being shut out at home for the second time in the playoffs. The 
last time it happened, they rebounded to win four straight against 
defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have the ability to do that,'' said Dallas defenseman  
Shawn Chambers. ``They have so many talented players. They have 
three lines of straight talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's unpredictable temperament is enough to keep Stars  
coach Ken Hitchcock from daydreaming about finally reaching the 
Stanley Cup finals after 19 years of coaching junior hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think either team has control of anything right now,''  
Hitchcock said. ``We certainly as a group don't feel we have 
control of any momentum other than we gained home ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even home ice means nothing to the Avalanche, 7-1 on the road in  
the playoffs and 2-5 at home. They were booed regularly by the home 
crowd Wednesday and skated off to a near-empty McNichols Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the position we hoped to be in, but we're just a win  
away from tying the series,'' Roy said. ``We all understand the 
importance of (Friday's) game. We have to come up with our biggest 
home game of the season.''

<HEADLINE> AirTran Accuses Delta on Pricing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- AirTran is accusing Delta Air Lines of matching  
its fares and adding flights to drive out low-cost competition and 
ultimately raise fares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delta's competitive response to AirTran over the years, and  
increasingly in recent days, has only one objective -- drive a 
small-but-growing, successful low-fare carrier out of its 
markets,'' AirTran wrote in a brief sent to the federal Justice and 
Transportation departments. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations come on the heels of a government lawsuit  
against American Airlines for predator pricing against smaller 
rivals. The Justice Department charged in the suit that American 
cut fares and added flights temporarily to drive low-cost 
competitors out of its giant hub airport outside Dallas and Fort 
Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta spokesman Bill Berry called the charges ``insulting and  
untrue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Executives at the Orlando, Fla.-based AirTran, who insisted they  
were working on the brief before the May 13 American suit, said 
they aren't seeking a lawsuit or specific remedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've done is reviewed the competitive practices,''  
AirTran President Robert Fornaro said. ``We want the DOJ and DOT to 
pass judgment on them however they see fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said AirTran, formerly ValuJet, has made such claims for  
years to divert attention from its own problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``No government agency has ever found Delta to be in the wrong.  
It's time for AirTran, which is one of the largest discount 
carriers in the country, to accept responsibility for its past 
marketing failures and stop blaming the competition,'' Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the AirTran brief:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Delta has raised walk-up fares 52 percent on the  
Atlanta-Richmond, Va., route since AirTran withdrew last winter in 
the face of intensive fare-matching. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Delta last fall began flights to Chicago-Midway Airport, which  
it had never before served, and undercut AirTran's average fares by 
8 percent. AirTran said it may be forced to withdraw from that 
route, too. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Delta responded to a recent AirTran sale by not only matching  
fares but also dropping round-trip and weekend stay requirements. 
The response, which AirTran claims was unprecedented, came after it 
announced a first-quarter profit -- only its second in the past two 
years.

<HEADLINE>  Silverbulletday Adds Belmont Spice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The sizzle of Charismatic's Triple Crown bid in  
the Belmont Stakes has gotten some added spice with the commitment 
of the filly Silverbulletday to the 1 1/2-mile classic June 5. 
</P>
<P>
	While Charismatic will be trying to become the 12th Triple Crown  
winner and first since Affirmed in 1978, Silverbulletday will be 
attempting to become the third filly to win the Belmont. The only 
winners were Tanya in 1905 and Ruthless in 1867, in the first 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's in the Belmont,'' trainer Bob Baffert said by telephone  
Wednesday from Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert's spoiler role follows his failed bids to win the Triple  
Crown with Silver Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet last year. Both 
colts finished second. 
</P>
<P>
	`She's a pure athlete, and athletes sometimes do things they are  
not supposed to do,'' owner Mike Pegram said of the decision to 
have Silverbulletday make her debut against colts in the Belmont. 
``We have absolutely nothing to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, winner of 11 of 12 starts and unbeaten in five  
races this year, will be only the 21st filly to start in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said the decision to run Silverbulletday in the Belmont  
was made after she worked six furlongs in 1:10 4-5 Tuesday at 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``She cooled out great after a good, hard work,'' Baffert said.  
``She was playing and bucking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said Silverbulletday will be flown to New York next  
Wednesday, the day entries are taken for the Belmont. Jerry Bailey 
will ride her for the second time in her career. Charismatic will 
be flow from the Downs to New York on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday also was entered in the Kentucky Derby and  
Preakness, but also was entered into filly stakes held the day 
before either of those races. She won the Kentucky Oaks at 
Churchill Downs and the Black-Eyed Susan at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he second-guessed himself about not running  
Silverbulletday in the Derby or Preakness, Pegram said, ``Not one 
bit. But if I didn't run her in the Belmont, I would be 
second-guessing myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday being in the race means that owners of the last  
unsuccessful Triple Crown challengers will be represented in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram, owns Real Quiet; Charismatic is owned by Bob and Beverly  
Lewis, owners of Silver Charm, and Menifee is co-owned by Arthur 
Hancock III, co-owner of Sunday Silence, runnerup in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	A field of 12 to 14 3-year-olds was shaping up for the Belmont.

<HEADLINE> NASA Honors Memory of CNN Reporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- In a launch-day salute to John  
Holliman, NASA today named its press auditorium after the late CNN 
correspondent. 
</P>
<P>
	Holliman, who covered the space program and even haggled with  
the Russians for a ride on Mir, was killed in a car accident 
outside Atlanta in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``John was a true space fan,'' said NASA Administrator Daniel  
Goldin. ``And he conveyed that sense of excitement to his audience. 
John didn't simply report on space issues. He conveyed the deep 
passion he had for his stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dedication followed Discovery's liftoff on a space station  
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know John has the best seat in the house, and if he  
were here, he would be the first to tell the world about the 
successful liftoff this morning,'' Goldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holliman's widow, Dianne, and 5-year-old son, Jay, attended the  
ceremony at the Kennedy Space Center press site, as did Tom 
Johnson, chairman of the CNN News Group.

<HEADLINE> Tiananmen Anniversary Worries China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Taiwanese journalists are being locked out, pager  
companies forbidden to transmit news and a Hong Kong cable station 
disconnected from many of its Chinese viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves by China's government over the past few weeks appear  
aimed at muzzling independent information sources that could pass 
on word about attempts to commemorate this year's highly sensitive 
10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square democracy protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind them are deep fears that leaking such news would rally  
forces opposed to the communist government and bring a replay, or 
worse, of the massive protests that ended 10 years ago next Friday 
with a military assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Routine requests for permission to report from China submitted  
by two of Taiwan's top newspapers and two cable news stations have 
been turned down, editors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwanese reporters now in China say their permits expire at the  
end of May and the Chinese officials in charge of monitoring them 
indicated permits would not be reissued until after the June 4 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's lively Chinese-language media run frequent critical  
reports about China. Taiwanese reporters easily blend in, making it 
more difficult for security forces to track their movements as they 
do other foreign reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Access to Taiwanese reports by ordinary Chinese -- possibly over  
the Internet -- threatens the government's control over what 
information their citizens receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese officials denied Taiwanese permits were being refused as  
a matter of policy. Yang Yi, with the State Council's Taiwan 
Affairs Office, said applications for reporting over June 4 had 
been received, but he declined to say if they had been approved, 
citing restrictions on discussing ``internal matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan and China have no official contacts and Taiwanese  
reporters are allowed to stay here for only about a month at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	That especially worries Chinese leaders as the anniversary  
approaches. The crackdown, which killed hundreds, possibly 
thousands, and saw thousands of others sent to jail, remains an 
emotional issue for many in China. 
</P>
<P>
	China's leaders fear dissidents could use the anniversary to  
stir up farmers disgruntled by stagnating incomes and high taxes 
and workers laid off from failing state industries. 
</P>
<P>
	China's entirely state-controlled media have been mute on the  
Tiananmen protests, officially regarded as an attempt to overthrow 
the government. Dissidents who reportedly called for commemorations 
have been detained or placed under intense surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	In Shanghai, China's commercial capital, pager and computer  
information services were ordered recently to stop transmitting 
news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has warned cable operators in Chinese cities to  
stop carrying Hong Kong-based Phoenix Satellite Television Co.'s 
channel. Residents in Beijing report being unable to see the 
station for nearly two weeks. One foreigner preparing to move into 
a new apartment in Beijing was told by his landlord that the unit's 
cable television would not be connected until after June 4, by 
order of security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix declined to comment on the reports.  
</P>
<P>
	Other newspapers and television stations in Hong Kong, which  
maintained its free press when it reverted from British to Chinese 
sovereignty in 1997, said they face no unusual restrictions on 
their reporting in China. Beijing has tacit, long-standing bans 
that keep its most virulent critics in Hong Kong from reporting in 
China.

<HEADLINE> Hasek Set To Return in Game 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Now it's up to the Dominator.  
</P>
<P>
	After sitting out the the first two games of the Eastern  
Conference finals against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Buffalo Sabres 
goaltender Dominik Hasek has been given the go-ahead to return to 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek expected to make the big decision sometime before Game 3  
tonight at Marine Midland Arena. The best-of-7 series is tied at a 
game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's medically cleared to play,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff  
said this morning after a light team practice. ``He's willing to 
give it a go. He knows his team needs him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek chose to rest all day. Ruff said his star goalie would see  
a doctor again today, then test his injured groin in warmups 
tonight before making it official. Ruff would not say who would be 
the backup if Hasek starts. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving up 10 goals in splitting the first two games in  
Toronto, the Sabres were more than ready to see Hasek back on the 
ice. The Sabres were a dispirited team after losing 6-3 in Game 2 
on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, who has been out while Dwayne Roloson played in his  
place, skated for a half-hour on Wednesday and said he liked how he 
was progressing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't stop too many pucks, but I felt very good,'' said  
Hasek, who has won the last two Hart trophies as league MVP. ``I 
didn't do everything, but my skating was almost without pain. I 
feel closer to playing the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know with this injury I won't be 100 percent. But I've  
already played with the injury and I wasn't 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Hasek decides on further rest, Ruff said either Roloson or  
minor leaguer Martin Biron would start. Biron played Wednesday 
night in the AHL playoffs at Rochester and made 29 saves in the 
Americans' 3-0 win over Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buffalo offense also was set for a boost. The Sabres'  
leading scorer, Miroslav Satan, said he was ready to return, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors told me I have to go through some pain, and a little  
bit is still there, but it's nothing I can't handle,'' said Satan, 
who suffered an injury to his right foot in the opening round of 
the playoffs against Ottawa and hasn't played since, a span of nine 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres certainly need any kind of edge. So do the Maplel  
Leafs, at least according to coach Pat Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to try to get better,'' Quinn said. ``If we don't, we  
won't survive this series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Quinn's protestations, the Maple Leafs did OK in Game 2,  
jumping to an early 2-0 lead and throwing plenty of doubt into the 
seldom-used Roloson and his teammates. The six Toronto goals were 
the most the Sabres have allowed in the playoffs, and the only ones 
Buffalo got against goalie Curtis Joseph came on Buffalo's suddenly 
strong power play. The Sabres have scored at least one power-play 
goal in each of their 12 playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew they were going to come out hard, and they did,'' said  
Sabres center Curtis Brown, who leads the team with five playoff 
goals. ``But it's not about who wins the first game or the second 
game. It's the first team to get to four.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what the coaches say, the absence of Hasek has had an  
effect on this series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always hard to play against Buffalo because of Hasek,''  
said Maple Leafs defenseman Dimitri Yushkevich. ``We make like 50 
shots and he always stops them all. It's hard to score on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Hasek plays but doesn't return to his dominant form -- he  
leads all playoff goalies with a .942 save percentage -- the Sabres 
will be hard-pressed to advance to the Stanley Cup finals for only 
the second time in team history. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting Hasek back might be just what the Sabres need to revert  
to their tight-checking brand of play. Without Hasek to confront, 
the Maple Leafs, who led the NHL in scoring during the regular 
season, have scored nine goals against Roloson and one 
empty-netter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just looking to get back to our game,'' said Sabres  
defenseman Jay McKee, who is a solid plus-7 in the playoffs. 
``We're not happy with that last one. I don't know if Toronto has 
gotten us off our game or if it's just us, but it's too 
run-and-gun.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 235.23 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled Thursday as renewed worries of  
inflation and higher interest rates sent the market back into its 
retreat from record heights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 235.23, a 2.2 percent  
loss, to close at 10,466.93. It was the ninth-worst one-day point 
drop ever, and the steepest since Sept. 30, 1998, when the 
blue-chip average fell 237.20. But in percentage terms, it was far 
from a record decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators also fell, although their losses were  
comparatively modest. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 23.35 to 
1,281.41, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 7.98 to 2,419.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Just this week, the Dow has tumbled 362.35 points, or by 3.3  
percent. The steep selloff Thursday made the previous day's 
171.07-point gain seem like a distant memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday's market looked really good, but without a  
follow-through, it's hard for stocks to pick up steam,'' said Barry 
Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the selling came from investors cashing in on  
Wednesday's rally in advance of the Memorial Day weekend. But the 
strongest factor, analysts said, was the continuing fear that a 
rekindling of inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	New government figures on the economy kept the market off  
balance Thursday. The Commerce Department said the U.S. economy 
grew at a robust annual rate of 4.1 percent in the first quarter, 
exacerbating fears that the Fed will raise rates to prevent the 
economy from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	That depressed bond prices, sending the yield of 30-year  
Treasurys rising to 5.84 percent from 5.80 percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department report also revealed news that could  
have heartened the market. An inflation gauge tied to the gross 
domestic product rose a modest 1.1 percent, and corporate profits 
showed a big rebound in the first three months of this year. 
Profits rose at an annual rate of $31.8 billion after having fallen 
at a rate of $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But David Orr, chief economist at First Union Capital Markets,  
pointed out that the fourth quarter included $13.5 billion in 
lawsuit settlements by tobacco companies. Without those crushing 
payments, the increase in profits would have been much more modest. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate profits have loomed in the background of the  
interest-rate watch. Higher rates typically cut into profits as it 
becomes more expensive for companies to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which soared more than 15 points Wednesday before a 2-for-1  
stock split that took effect at the close of trading, fell 2 1/8 on 
Thursday to 116. Some analysts also blamed persistent worries that 
computer makers will see their profit margins shrink as they cut 
prices to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank and brokerage stocks, which typically suffer when interest  
rates rise, were mostly lower. J.P. Morgan, a component of the Dow, 
lost 3 3/4 to 135 1/8 and Wells Fargo fell 2 1/16 to 39 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	And cyclical stocks -- those with fortunes tied to swings in the  
economy -- fell as investors locked in gains from a recent upward 
surge. 3M, down 2 13/16 to 86, and Caterpillar, down 2 7/16 to 55 3/8, 
were among the worst-performing Dow cyclicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts attributed the Nasdaq's stronger performance to  
bargain-hunting following a sharp selloff of Internet stocks early 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those stocks had been already been beaten up pretty badly, so  
today, they're resisting the decline of the rest of the market,'' 
said Robert Robbins, senior vice president and market strategist at 
Robinson-Humphrey Co. Inc. of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, investors sent many Internet companies lower again,  
choosing instead to buy high-tech veterans like Intel, which rose 1 
7/16 to 53 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-6 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Volume totaled 809.18 million shares, 
compared with 868.39 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 10.82 to 614.02, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index dropped 8.27 to 774.39. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.49 to 432.92. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.33 percent.  
Germany's DAX index closed 2.3 percent lower, Britain's FT-SE 100 
fell 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 ended 1.1 percent lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday morning, trading in General Motors stock will reflect the  
spinoff of its Delphi Automotive Systems unit. GM, which closed 
Thursday at 82 7/8, will open at 68 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Berry Pickers' Union Votes Counted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALINAS, Calif. (AP) -- Workers at the nation's largest  
strawberry grower won't know which union will represent them in 
contract negotiations until state labor officials sort out 
challenges to the eligibility of some voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote by workers at Coastal Berry Co. on Wednesday was  
considered a key test of the United Farm Workers' effort to regain 
the influence it had in agriculture under the leadership of the 
late Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	But the best the UFW can appear to hope for is a runoff election  
against its rival union, the Coastal Berry of California Farm 
Worker Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW received votes from 577 of the opened ballots, Coastal  
Berry had 646, and 79 opted for no union representation, labor 
officials said. The eligibility of 60 additional voters was 
challenged, mostly by labor officials but some by the unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the voting rules, a runoff is required unless one of the  
three options wins a simple majority. Because of the eligibility 
challenges, it was still uncertain today whether Coastal Berry 
would have enough to win a majority, or if it would have to face 
UFW in a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural Labor Relations Board officials planned to meet  
today to discuss the unresolved ballots, said the board's regional 
director Fred Capuyan, but a final tally could be days away. 
</P>
<P>
	The sweat was visible on the forehead of strawberry picker Jose  
Rojas as he waited to learn the results of the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	For nine years, Rojas has worked in Watsonville at Coastal  
Berry. He cast his ballot in favor of the UFW, and said a vote to 
unionize would make his backbreaking efforts for his three sons 
worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my sacrifice to be worth a better life for them,''  
Rojas said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the vote are considered pivotal in the UFW's  
effort to overcome the doldrums it fell into even before the 1993 
death of Chavez, who inspired 80,000 farm workers to join up by 
1970. Union membership had declined to 20,000 by the time he died. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the UFW launched its rebuilding campaign in the  
strawberry fields, where picking the crops is entry-level farm 
work, the most backbreaking, low-skilled labor available. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the UFW has won 18 union elections and signed 22  
first-time contracts with growers of other crops, increasing 
overall membership to 27,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state's $600 million strawberry industry, which employs  
about 20,000 workers, has been resistant. Until this week, the only 
strawberry grower to sign a UFW contract was a small organic farm 
with 50 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW committed itself to winning at Coastal Berry five years  
ago, hoping a victory would create momentum for similar successes 
throughout California's farm fields. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign has been plagued by setbacks.  
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a long struggle at Coastal Berry,'' said UFW  
spokesman Marc Grossman. ``The strawberry industry wants to stop 
UFW progress at all costs, and Coastal Berry could be a crucial 
turning point for the workers statewide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Berry Co. President Ernie Farley said the company was  
neutral on who represents the workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just looking forward to an end to the whole process,''  
he said. ``We spend an awful lot of time managing that process 
rather than managing the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Worker's pickers are treated better than some in the  
berry fields, Farley said. They earn an average wage of $7.50 to 
$8.50 an hour and have full medical and dental benefits for 
themselves and dependents.

<HEADLINE>  Silverbulletday Adds Belmont Spice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The sizzle of Charismatic's Triple Crown bid in  
the Belmont Stakes has gotten some added spice with the commitment 
of the filly Silverbulletday to the 1 1/2-mile classic June 5. 
</P>
<P>
	While Charismatic will be trying to become the 12th Triple Crown  
winner and first since Affirmed in 1978, Silverbulletday will be 
attempting to become the third filly to win the Belmont. The only 
winners were Tanya in 1905 and Ruthless in 1867, in the first 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's in the Belmont,'' trainer Bob Baffert said by telephone  
Wednesday from Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert's spoiler role follows his failed bids to win the Triple  
Crown with Silver Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet last year. Both 
colts finished second. 
</P>
<P>
	`She's a pure athlete, and athletes sometimes do things they are  
not supposed to do,'' owner Mike Pegram said of the decision to 
have Silverbulletday make her debut against colts in the Belmont. 
``We have absolutely nothing to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, winner of 11 of 12 starts and unbeaten in five  
races this year, will be only the 21st filly to start in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said the decision to run Silverbulletday in the Belmont  
was made after she worked six furlongs in 1:10 4-5 Tuesday at 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``She cooled out great after a good, hard work,'' Baffert said.  
``She was playing and bucking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said Silverbulletday will be flown to New York next  
Wednesday, the day entries are taken for the Belmont. Jerry Bailey 
will ride her for the second time in her career. Charismatic will 
be flow from the Downs to New York on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday also was entered in the Kentucky Derby and  
Preakness, but also was entered into filly stakes held the day 
before either of those races. She won the Kentucky Oaks at 
Churchill Downs and the Black-Eyed Susan at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he second-guessed himself about not running  
Silverbulletday in the Derby or Preakness, Pegram said, ``Not one 
bit. But if I didn't run her in the Belmont, I would be 
second-guessing myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday being in the race means that owners of the last  
unsuccessful Triple Crown challengers will be represented in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram, owns Real Quiet; Charismatic is owned by Bob and Beverly  
Lewis, owners of Silver Charm, and Menifee is co-owned by Arthur 
Hancock III, co-owner of Sunday Silence, runnerup in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	A field of 12 to 14 3-year-olds was shaping up for the Belmont.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Joao Carlos de Oliveira, who held the  
world record in the triple jump for a decade, slipped into a coma 
and was listed in ``extremely serious condition,'' doctors said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveira, who was hospitalized in April with lung and liver  
ailments, was bleeding from the lungs and responded only to painful 
stimuli, according to a statement signed by Dr. Jose Carlete and 
Dr. Antonio Pinheiro at the Beneficiencia Portuguesa Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveira, 44, became a national hero when he set the world  
record with a jump of 58 feet, 8 1/4 inches at the 1975 Pan American 
Games in Mexico, a mark that stood for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He also won bronze medals in the 1976 and 1980 Olympics.  
Brazilians dubbed him ``Joao do Pulo,'' Portuguese for ``Jumping 
John.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, however, Oliveira's car was hit head-on by a drunk  
driver going the wrong way at night on an interstate highway. 
Oliveira was seriously injured, and doctors amputated his right 
leg.

<HEADLINE> Former Chase Vice President Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A former vice president and chief financial  
officer of the Credit Card Division of Chase USA was arrested 
Thursday at his Connecticut home on charges that he submitted false 
documents to obtain $4.3 million in loans. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Wilson was fired by Chase USA, a subsidiary of Chase  
Manhattan Corp., after Chase officials discovered that he had 
allegedly provided false information on his loan documents, 
prosecutors said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson was charged with three counts of filing a false loan  
application and one count of bank fraud in the scheme, which 
allegedly occurred in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors accused Wilson of obtaining two loans worth $2.36  
million from Chase Manhattan Bank and Chase Manhattan Mortgage Co. 
by falsely claiming ownership of about $1.1 million in stock 
options from his previous employer, General Electric Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson left GE Capital in June 1996 to move to Chase and did not  
possess any stock options at the time he submitted the loan 
applications in 1998, prosecutors said. He was fired by Chase last 
month after the bank discovered what it said was false and 
fraudulent information in his loan application. 
</P>
<P>
	A criminal complaint alleged that Wilson obtained a $1.56  
million loan from Chase Manhattan Mortgage to buy a $2.4 million 
property in Ridgefield, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, also  
alleged that he obtained a third loan worth $2 million from Webster 
Bank in Cheshire, Conn., by falsely concealing that he had an 
outstanding loan from Chase Manhattan Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Wilson faces a maximum sentence on each of the  
four counts of 30 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Texas OKs Electric Deregulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas' $20 billion utility market faces a  
sweeping overhaul under an industry deregulation bill that 
supporters say will reduce electric bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation was approved by the state Senate Thursday and  
sent to Gov. George W. Bush, who plans to sign the bill into law 
joining Texas with 20 other states that also have moved to 
deregulate the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill supporters say the measure will mean lower rates and better  
reliability for consumers who could shop for their utility 
providers. The Senate approved the bill on a voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, electric rates would be frozen at their  
current level until Jan. 1, 2002. They would then be lowered by 6 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill supporters expect utility companies to be enticed into  
moving to Texas to offer lower prices and new technology, including 
devices that tell consumers when they are wasting electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was criticized by some consumer groups who have  
questioned whether consumers want to move toward deregulation and 
whether the bill provides enough consumer protections. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents had pointed to other examples of deregulation where  
states saw power companies ignore residential consumers in favor of 
commercial customers.

<HEADLINE>  Drivers Encouraged By Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Drivers, owners and officials with the IRL  
and CART are encouraged by peace talks between the rival leagues, 
saying a reconciliation will ensure success for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got to do it,'' said Robby Gordon, an owner-driver in  
the Indy Racing League and Championship Auto Racing Teams. 
</P>
<P>
	After four years of a bitter feud that threatens the future of  
open-wheel racing in the United States, CART and the IRL have begun 
face-to-face talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of the negotiations came as teams prepared for the  
Indianapolis 500, which lost its luster during the fight when the 
best-known drivers decided to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can confirm that there have been some very informal talks  
with Tony George,'' Andrew Craig, president and CEO of CART, told 
The Associated Press. ``However, I am not prepared to comment on 
any of the details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no comment -- but also no denial of the talks -- from  
George, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway president who started the 
war when he formed the Indy Racing League late in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	CART fired back by boycotting Indy, leaving George to stage the  
world's most famous auto race with virtually no stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences between the two circuits once seemed  
insurmountable, with different chassis and engine rules. But the 
last few weeks have brought hope that a settlement could be reached 
as early as 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they need to do is keep the IRL specs,'' Gordon said,  
referring to the rules in the newer series. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, scheduled to drive in the CART race on Saturday in  
Madison, Ill., and the Indy 500 on Sunday, says one problem that 
has been construed as the biggest hurdle -- engines -- should really 
be easy to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	CART teams lease their engines, starting at about $1.3 million a  
season, while the IRL teams buy theirs for $80,000 each. But IRL 
teams also have to do all their own engine work. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people, including me, would rather not have to have  
an engine shop,'' Gordon said. ``That costs a lot of money, and 
every rebuild is $50,000. My engine budget for Indy this year is 
$400,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually everyone on both sides agrees a unified series is  
imperative for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's CART's position that open-wheel racing would benefit  
greatly from having one series instead of two,'' Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Ray, one of the bright new IRL stars, said: ``We're  
continuing to prove ourselves as drivers, as teams and as a sport. 
But when everybody's fighting, it's hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``If two people are trying to climb Mt. Everest, it's harder to  
get to the top if they're fighting each other. Hopefully, we'll 
come together or learn to coexist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray also pointed out a unification would add to the  
already-strong competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of 30 competitors at each race, you might see 60,'' he  
said. ``Twenty or 30 might have to go home each week, sort of like 
NASCAR. ... It would be exciting. It would be fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A unification also would make it a lot easier to market  
open-wheel racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Barnes, president of a California marketing firm that  
works with a number of former Indy 500 champions, said it's tough 
to sell the sport to corporate America because of the split. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're trying to sell the CART series, you're missing the  
major element, the Indy 500,'' he said. ``If you're trying to sell 
the IRL, to be candid, it's really a Triple-A league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Cheever, the defending Indy 500 champion and a former CART  
driver, said he's for unification as long as CART is willing to 
keep costs down and promote NASCAR-type competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be very reluctant to be involved in any series that  
doesn't adhere to those principles,'' Cheever said. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR president Bill France Jr., the most powerful man in  
American auto racing, is widely reported to be brokering the peace. 
He did not return phone calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	His interest, however, would not be surprising. France also  
heads International Speedway Corp., which after its recent purchase 
of Penske Motorsports has 10 racetracks with at least three more 
planned in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	ISC will need more than just its stock car and truck divisions  
to keep those tracks busy and prosperous.

<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Drivers, owners and officials with the IRL  
and CART are encouraged by peace talks between the rival leagues, 
saying a reconciliation will ensure success for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got to do it,'' said Robby Gordon, an owner-driver in  
the Indy Racing League and Championship Auto Racing Teams. 
</P>
<P>
	After four years of a bitter feud that threatens the future of  
open-wheel racing in the United States, CART and the IRL have begun 
face-to-face talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of the negotiations came as teams prepared for the  
Indianapolis 500, which lost its luster during the fight when the 
best-known drivers decided to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can confirm that there have been some very informal talks  
with Tony George,'' Andrew Craig, president and CEO of CART, told 
The Associated Press. ``However, I am not prepared to comment on 
any of the details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no comment -- but also no denial of the talks -- from  
George, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway president who started the 
war when he formed the Indy Racing League late in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	CART fired back by boycotting Indy, leaving George to stage the  
world's most famous auto race with virtually no stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences between the two circuits once seemed  
insurmountable, with different chassis and engine rules. But the 
last few weeks have brought hope that a settlement could be reached 
as early as 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they need to do is keep the IRL specs,'' Gordon said,  
referring to the rules in the newer series. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, scheduled to drive in the CART race on Saturday in  
Madison, Ill., and the Indy 500 on Sunday, says one problem that 
has been construed as the biggest hurdle -- engines -- should really 
be easy to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	CART teams lease their engines, starting at about $1.3 million a  
season, while the IRL teams buy theirs for $80,000 each. But IRL 
teams also have to do all their own engine work. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people, including me, would rather not have to have  
an engine shop,'' Gordon said. ``That costs a lot of money, and 
every rebuild is $50,000. My engine budget for Indy this year is 
$400,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually everyone on both sides agrees a unified series is  
imperative for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's CART's position that open-wheel racing would benefit  
greatly from having one series instead of two,'' Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Ray, one of the bright new IRL stars, said: ``We're  
continuing to prove ourselves as drivers, as teams and as a sport. 
But when everybody's fighting, it's hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``If two people are trying to climb Mt. Everest, it's harder to  
get to the top if they're fighting each other. Hopefully, we'll 
come together or learn to coexist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray also pointed out a unification would add to the  
already-strong competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of 30 competitors at each race, you might see 60,'' he  
said. ``Twenty or 30 might have to go home each week, sort of like 
NASCAR. ... It would be exciting. It would be fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A unification also would make it a lot easier to market  
open-wheel racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Barnes, president of a California marketing firm that  
works with a number of former Indy 500 champions, said it's tough 
to sell the sport to corporate America because of the split. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're trying to sell the CART series, you're missing the  
major element, the Indy 500,'' he said. ``If you're trying to sell 
the IRL, to be candid, it's really a Triple-A league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Cheever, the defending Indy 500 champion and a former CART  
driver, said he's for unification as long as CART is willing to 
keep costs down and promote NASCAR-type competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be very reluctant to be involved in any series that  
doesn't adhere to those principles,'' Cheever said. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR president Bill France Jr., the most powerful man in  
American auto racing, is widely reported to be brokering the peace. 
He did not return phone calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	His interest, however, would not be surprising. France also  
heads International Speedway Corp., which after its recent purchase 
of Penske Motorsports has 10 racetracks with at least three more 
planned in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	ISC will need more than just its stock car and truck divisions  
to keep those tracks busy and prosperous.

<HEADLINE> US OKs Moving Poor To Managed Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The federal government has given the state  
permission to move 1.5 million Medicaid recipients in New York City 
into managed care health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The switch from traditional fee-for-service based plans was  
advocated by both Gov. George Pataki and New York Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani as a way to improve care for the poor and reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also means Medicaid recipients could face fewer choices in  
physicians and other care providers. 
</P>
<P>
	About 650,000 of the state's 3.5 million Medicaid recipients are  
already enrolled in managed care programs; in 1997, the federal 
government granted approval to add eight upstate New York counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki had long sought federal approval to force New York City  
recipients into managed care. They will be added over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki has complained that New York has the highest Medicaid  
cost in the country at about $24 billion.

<HEADLINE> Stewart To Start 27th in Coca-Cola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Tony Stewart was assured a spot in the  
Coca-Cola 600 field even though he didn't even attend the second 
round of time trials Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, trying to become just the second driver to compete in  
the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day, failed 
to qualify in Wednesday night's first round of qualifying at Lowe's 
Motor Speedway at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	But he stood on his speed, a lap of 182.865 mph, for Thursday's  
second round, electing instead to fly to Indianapolis and take part 
in the final practice session for the 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing on his speed meant Stewart got the 27th starting spot  
in Charlotte's 43-car field, but he likely will start at the back 
of the grid. That's NASCAR's mandatory penalty for any driver who 
fails to show up for the start of the drivers' meeting. Sunday's 
meeting is scheduled to start two hours before the race, and it's 
unlikely Stewart will have arrived by then. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart will start 24th at Indianapolis, where he plans to run  
500 miles before flying immediately to Charlotte for the early 
evening start of the 600. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Waltrip, one of eight drivers to take part in  
second-round qualifying, was the only one to go fast enough to earn 
a spot in the field. Waltrip will start 33rd. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------

	HORNADAY'S ASCENT: Ron Hornaday, winner of two championships in  
three years on NASCAR's Craftsman Truck Series, is moving to the 
Busch Grand National circuit in 2000 with his same team and same 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornaday, driving a Dale Earnhardt Inc.-owned truck, will drive  
Chevrolet Monte Carlos on the Grand National circuit. DEI's current 
Grand National driver, Dale Earnhardt Jr., is moving up to the 
Winston Cup circuit next year. 
</P>
<P>
	NAPA auto parts, Hornaday's primary Truck Series sponsor, said  
Thursday it has signed a three-year deal to back the Grand National 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since I was little I've watched the No. 3 car of Dale  
Earnhardt,'' Hornaday said. ``To drive for him now is pretty 
awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hornaday's move into Grand National racing raises the question  
of what will become of DEI's truck team. Earnhardt said it's too 
soon to tell. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking right now at our options for drivers and our  
options for sponsors for 2000,'' he said. ``The team's intact. The 
equipment's there. We plan to win the championship this year with 
Ron and look at our options for next year. The door's wide open 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	TOURIST ATTRACTIONS: With relatively few activities scheduled at  
the track Friday, many of the visiting race fans were expected to 
take part in what has become an annual ritual -- touring the 
region's race shops. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearby Mooresville, authorities planned to dispatch extra  
police to help direct traffic at Lakeside Park, a complex that 
houses about 50 race teams and related businesses. Lakeside got so 
many visitors last year on the Friday before the 600 that police 
had to briefly close off the park because of traffic jams on the 
surrounding roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Two new facilities are expected to be among the most popular on  
the unofficial shop tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Earnhardt Inc.'s 112,000-square-foot complex in south  
Mooresville features a 15,000-square-foot museum and gift shop that 
just opened this week. The museum houses memorabilia from The 
Intimidator's career, and visitors also can look through large 
glass panes at work going on in portions of DEI's shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Even bigger is the 125,000-square-foot new home of Joe Gibbs  
Racing, which opened at the turn of the year in the north Charlotte 
suburb of Huntersville. Gibbs' complex includes a movie theater 
with stadium-style seating and a 100-yard-long window that enables 
visitors to see into the main shop.

<HEADLINE> Test Scores May Be Political Pawn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House hearing today on states' excluding  
special-education students from a national reading test turned into 
a debate on whether the administration improperly used the results 
to promote its education policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not let politics influence our ability to measure  
student achievement,'' said GOP Rep. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, 
chairman of the House Education and the Workforce's investigations 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic colleague, Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., suggested  
Hoekstra was pursuing his own political target: Vice President Al 
Gore, who first released the national test scores in February and 
highlighted gains posted under President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	An Education Department review of 1998 scores found states might  
have fared better on the congressionally mandated tests of 
fourth-graders because more disabled students than in previous 
years did not take the test. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen states excluded higher numbers of  
special-needs students last year than before, note critics of the 
test, known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's outgoing chief statistician, Pascal D. Forgione  
Jr., told lawmakers ``it would never be possible to know precisely 
the impact of exclusion rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend including more special-needs students, who could  
have scored poorly, probably would have lowered the states' scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Forgione, who oversaw the department's review, which was  
released earlier this month, offered research to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
	Department researchers used a model analysis of how excluded  
students might have scored. Only two states with large jumps in 
reading scores, Maryland and Kentucky, would not have shown 
improved results from earlier years had more special-education 
students taken the national test in 1998, Forgione reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The department will not use the findings to adjust state scores  
or rankings, Forgione said. But future studies will examine the 
severity of the excluded students' disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the sea of statistics, the hearing shifted more to partisan  
politics than education policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate focused on two events: the February announcement of  
national test results by Gore at an Education Department news 
conference also attended by several groups supportive of the 
administration's education proposals, and the release of state 
scores in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore emphasized increases in scores from 1994 from 1998, rather  
than their lack of change from 1992, and mentioned more than a 
dozen Clinton education programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoekstra angered Democratic members of the subcommittee when he  
suggested the Gore news conference violated the test-givers' policy 
of nonpartisanship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would not be here today if the Vice President wasn't  
running for president,'' responded Roemer. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats pointed out that in 1992, then-President Bush upset  
test-givers by mentioning unreleased data and criticizing the 
results at a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress, which created the board of test-givers in 1988, also  
urged that the test's administration and release of results be 
``buffered from any manipulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said in a recent letter to  
Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., the committee chairman, that ``concerns 
about the release of the data are unwarranted.''

<HEADLINE> Gore: GOP, NRA Fighting Gun Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore called today for quick  
House action on gun control and accused Republicans of plotting to 
please the gun lobby by delaying a vote on Senate-passed 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay, Gore told reporters at the Capitol, ``is because some  
within the Republican caucus are so responsive to the'' National 
Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this very moment there are some of the other side meeting  
behind closed doors plotting to have more delays in order to 
preserve loopholes'' in firearms law, he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have refused Democratic demands to pass the Senate's  
gun provisions this week, outlining instead a schedule for cautious 
consideration of the provisions and a vote in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a Second Amendment, there is a fundamental right that  
we're dealing with and therefore we should move expeditiously but 
not in a stampede,'' Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who chairs the House 
Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday. ``We're going to do this and 
we're going to do it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's comments came a week after he broke a tie vote as the  
Senate passed a Democratic measure to require background checks of 
all firearms transactions at gun shows and pawn shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential candidate said the Senate bill didn't go far  
enough in gun restrictions and that the House should pass a tougher 
bill. He did not specify what additional provisions he would 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders have said they support the concept of the gun  
restrictions in the Senate bill but called a hearing today to 
investigate the specifics. Speaker Dennis Hastert and other GOP 
leaders have refused Democratic demands that they approve at least 
some of the Senate gun restrictions before mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing with Gore, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.,  
and about a dozen other congressional Democrats was a Virginia 
woman planning to testify later today before the House Judiciary 
crime subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrl Phillips-Taylor of Richmond, Va., said she was turning her  
grief over her son's murder to gun control activism. Clutching a 
photograph of her son, Scott, Phillips-Taylor told reporters that 
he had been killed eight years ago by a ``classmate with a grudge'' 
and an AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, 17, was lured by the classmate from his place of work and  
shot six times. 
</P>
<P>
	Also set to testify before the House subcommittee were NRA  
officials, the father of one of the murdered Columbine High School 
students and a Denver trauma surgeon who worked on some of the 
victims of those shootings.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Settlement Put on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co.'s $15 million discrimination  
settlement with black workers, mediated with help from the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson, was put on hold so a group of the workers opposed to 
the deal can state their objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Epstein of Philadelphia, an attorney for the objectors,  
said the settlement shortchanges the plaintiffs while richly 
rewarding their lawyers. He also raised questions about whether 
Boeing channeled money to people and projects associated with 
Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you believe Reverend Jackson engaged in fraudulent and  
collusive conduct? Yes or no?'' U.S. District Judge John Coughenour 
asked Epstein during Wednesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``No sir,'' Epstein replied. ``We believe he was misled.''  
</P>
<P>
	``That is untrue,'' Jackson press secretary Stephanie Gadlin  
said after the hearing. ``There are erroneous accusations being 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coughenour scheduled another hearing for Sept. 23, and gave  
Epstein permission to take several depositions, including Boeing 
Chairman Phil Condit. 
</P>
<P>
	Condit and Jackson announced on Jan. 22 the settlement of a  
class-action lawsuit in which 12,900 past and present Boeing 
workers would receive financial compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Boeing employees who alleged  
they were treated with hostility and passed over for promotions 
that went to less-qualified white employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest individual award is $50,000, while attorneys Oscar  
Desper III and Bruce Harrell of Seattle, who filed the first case 
in March 1998, receive $3.85 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In court, Desper called Epstein's objections ``unsubstantiated''  
and ``trickle-down hearsay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Epstein said Jackson asked consultant Gary Smith to be a  
``watchdog'' over the settlement, a role legally defined in the 
consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
	But Epstein said Smith sits on the board of directors of  
Jackson's Rainbow Coalition/PUSH Wall Street Project, which 
received a $50,000 contribution from Boeing in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is Boeing making direct contributions to the watchdog?''  
Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the donation was unrelated to  
the settlement.

<HEADLINE> McCain Discusses Education, Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, a Republican presidential  
candidate who jump-started his campaign with a hawkish stance on 
Kosovo, broadened his political agenda Thursday with campaign 
initiatives on Social Security, education and tax reform. 
</P>
<P>
	In a commencement address to Johns Hopkins University graduates,  
McCain challenged Republicans and Democrats alike to dramatically 
change their approach to domestic policy debates and end ``this 
sickness in American political life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is we who have squandered the public trust. We, who have --  
time and again, in full public view -- placed our personal or 
partisan interests before the national interest, earning the 
public's contempt with our poll-driven policies, our phony 
posturing, the lies we call spin, and the damage control we 
substitute for progress,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a three-term senator from Arizona, trails Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush and former American Red Cross president Elizabeth 
Dole in GOP polling but has emerged as a solid alternative should 
the early front-runners falter. 
</P>
<P>
	His poll ratings inched upward nationally, doubling in New  
Hampshire, as he conducted hundreds of television and newspaper 
interviews to criticize President Clinton's handling of Kosovo. The 
former Vietnam prisoner of war was the first presidential hopeful 
to say the United States must win at all cost, even if that means 
using grounds troops. 
</P>
<P>
	A self-styled political maverick, McCain has bucked his party  
leadership by proposing tax increases on tobacco and sweeping 
campaign finance reforms. Both initiatives failed. 
</P>
<P>
	With the campaign finance reform debate stirring anew in  
Congress, McCain said Thursday that the impasse won't end until 
politicians in both parties act ``with courage to break with the 
corrupting practices of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats must wean themselves from large, unregulated donations  
by labor unions, he said. As for his own party: ``Republicans will 
have to risk their financial superiority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is not a new formulation for the Arizona senator, but  
McCain expanded his attack-all-sides technique to outline new 
initiatives that he hopes will move his campaign beyond Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rank-and-file Republican voters don't really know him. A lot  
do, but those who don't are just getting to know him with Kosovo,'' 
said Republican consultant Charlie Black, a Bush ally. ``He 
certainly needs to fill out his agenda for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio said his surveys show that 51  
percent of GOP voters approve of McCain's position on Kosovo. 
``While a majority, it isn't overwhelming and isn't enough to get 
you elected,'' the pollster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign policy still ranks last on a list of issues important to  
GOP voters, with only 11 percent choosing the topic over three 
topics that tied for the lead: the economy, morality and social 
issues, Fabrizio said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care,'' McCain said in an interview before his  
address. ``If the polls showed 1 percent approved of my position, 
it wouldn't change my mind about what's right for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senator is taking care not to become a single-issue  
candidate. His speech Thursday was designed to produce a slim 
outline of his non-Kosovo agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans a series of speeches detailing his plans for Social  
Security, campaign finances, education and taxes, beginning next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	With his first step Thursday, he urged Republicans to resist  
using Social Security revenues to balance the budget and demanded 
that Democrats ``stop using the issue to scare the elderly into 
voting against Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized both parties in Congress for passing an emergency  
Kosovo bill that he said pays for nine ``pork barrel projects for 
every legitimate emergency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed forbidding the use of Social Security revenues on  
anything other than Social Security benefits. Under his plan, 
Americans would be allowed to invest part of their payroll taxes in 
private accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said 60 percent of the federal budget surplus should be  
used to bolster Social Security, with the rest going to tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he also would close special interest loopholes and  
subsidies to help pay for his tax-cut plan, which would lower the 
tax rate from 28 percent to 15 percent for people earning less than 
$35,000 or couples earning less than $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He also would end the tax penalty for married people, eliminate  
the policy that reduces Social Security benefits for elderly people 
who are still working; and reduce the inheritance tax. 
</P>
<P>
	On education, McCain said Republicans should recognize the  
``urgent necessity'' to raise teacher pay. Democrats, he said, must 
learn to accept ``teacher testing and merit pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good teachers should be rewarded and bad teachers should be  
encourage to ``do something else for a living,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Gets New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, whose party won  
a majority vote in recent parliamentary elections in Nepal, was 
named prime minister Thursday by the country's constitutional 
monarch. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly elected lawmakers earlier unanimously elected Bhattarai to  
lead the new government, which is expected to give the Himalayan 
kingdom some political stability after years of fractious coalition 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Bhattarai's Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats of the  
House of Representatives, Nepal's lower house of parliament. A 
party is required to secure at least half the seats to form a 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	A Cabinet led by Bhattarai will be sworn in by the weekend,  
party officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nepali Congress picked up many important seats from its  
rival, the United Marxist Leninist Communist Party of Nepal, 
breaking into some of the traditional strongholds of the communists 
in the eastern and far western parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nepali Congress majority could now end years of political  
deadlock that had given the country several unstable governments. 
Since the last polls in 1994 left a hung parliament, Nepal has had 
six short-lived administrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bhattarai said the government's priority will be a festering  
Maoist insurgency that has killed at least 800 people in three 
years of guerrilla warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels are demanding reforms and an end to the kingdom's  
constitutional monarchy, alleging police repression. They also 
demand an end to the centuries-old feudal structure in parts of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	King Birendra became a constitutional monarch after democracy  
was established in 1990. Nepal has had one majority, two minority 
and four coalition governments since then.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Bill Headed to Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agricultural commodities, livestock and  
products would be exempt from unilateral U.S. sanctions against 
foreign countries under a bill approved by the Senate Agriculture 
Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee action, on a 17-1 vote, sends the bill to the full  
Senate. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., was the sole dissenter. 
</P>
<P>
	``No sector of the U.S. economy is more reliant on international  
trade than agriculture,'' said Committee Chairman Dick Lugar, 
R-Ind., the bill's author. ``The continued viability of U.S. 
agriculture depends on our ability to have access, as unfettered as 
possible, to world markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel at the last minute agreed to an amendment by Sen. Kent  
Conrad, D-N.D., which narrowed the circumstances under which the 
president could impose agricultural sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The original version allowed the president to impose the  
sanctions if he deemed it in the national interest. The amendment 
changed that provision to allow the president to impose sanctions 
only if there is a declaration of war or if Congress agrees it is 
in the national interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is just one of several sanctions bills moving through  
Congress. Others include provisions to lift sanctions on medicine 
and medical equipment as well as food. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration last month opened the way for the  
sale of food and medical items to Iran, Libya and Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S.566.

<HEADLINE> Jazz May Face Hard-Nosed Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- In a series notable for its defense and  
the offending elbows of Karl Malone, the Portland Trail Blazers and 
Utah Jazz may be in for their most hard-nosed battle yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that if we go out there and play a good, solid game  
defensively and rebound, and step up to any physical challenge that 
may occur, we'll win the game,'' Portland's Brian Grant said of 
tonight's Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers lead the best-of-7 Western Conference semifinals  
3-2, but Utah stole the momentum with an impressive 88-71 victory 
Tuesday night in Salt Lake City. The Blazers also lost their cool 
and some blood on the Delta Center court. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone opened up a gash over Grant's right eye in the first  
quarter while Malone was going for a rebound. Grant lay on the 
floor in pain, and came back after getting six stitches. He was 
ineffective, however, scoring eight points on 1-of-7 shooting for 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, who didn't talk to the media after the game, said  
Wednesday that the hit was just part of a rough-and-tumble series. 
In fact, the cut represents what Grant wants to learn from Malone 
and the Utah Jazz: how to play with the intensity needed to win the 
biggest of games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he wasn't planning on elbowing me in the eye,'' Grant  
said. ``Even if it was intentional, that's part of the game. Those 
things are going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter, with the outcome decided, Grant was  
frustrated after Malone made a swipe at the ball. Grant faked a 
throw at the back of Malone's head, drawing a technical foul. That 
sent Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy into an uncharacteristic rage. 
</P>
<P>
	He stomped onto the court toward an official and, after being  
ejected, had to be restrained by assistant coaches and players. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Grant was in Malone's face, exchanging heated words  
with the future Hall of Famer. Malone said later that Grant had 
told him he disliked him. Malone said the feeling was mutual. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know where each other's coming from, and that's the way it  
is,'' Malone said. ``In the playoffs, you don't have to like me. I 
don't play this game for you to like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant said the substance of the obscenity-laced confrontation  
will stay a secret. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't about Brian Grant playing Karl Malone. It's about  
the Trail Blazers trying to win a championship this year,'' Grant 
said. ``I know we're not going to be able to do it with me 
bickering with one player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any ill feelings toward any of the Jazz. If  
anything, I can take a page from their book someday as far as how 
to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Game 5, Blazers teammate Isaiah Rider hinted that the team  
might bring a role player off the bench to take out Malone, a 
suggestion quickly shot down by Dunleavy and Grant. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not my approach,'' Grant said. ``I'm a ballplayer, not  
a wrestler. I'm not a fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blazers guard Damon Stoudamire said Grant was in a tough spot,  
having to show he won't back down without doing something that 
would get him thrown out of the game, or suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to focus and do the things he was doing up until this  
point,'' Stoudamire said. ``I don't think the Jazz are going to 
change up their game plan. They're going to come right after him, 
but Brian has to understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone was fined $10,000 by the NBA for elbowing Grant in the  
mouth in Game 1. As in Tuesday night's game, Malone was not 
whistled for a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does have a problem with his elbows,'' Dunleavy said. ``I  
don't want to make excuses. But if a guy continually hits people 
with elbows and they get cut, what does that tell you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rough play in Game 5 overshadowed an otherwise impressive  
performance by the Jazz, who say the pressure is now on the Blazers 
to win on their homecourt to avoid going back to Salt Lake City for 
Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they say they're not feeling a little pressure, I would say  
they're lying a little bit,'' Malone said. ``Because they're 
supposed to close us out because we're getting old, we can't do 
this, and we're predictable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz are trying to become the seventh team in NBA history to  
come back from a 3-1 deficit. The last to do it was the Miami Heat 
in 1997, against the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz have trailed 3-1 five times in the Malone-John Stockton  
era, and have yet to win a series. 
</P>
<P>
	But Utah is 6-1 the last two seasons when it had to win or go  
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not going to lay down,'' Grant said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Targets Unruly Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unruly airline passengers could be banned from  
flying for a year under a proposal pressed by two senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Bill Frist, R-Tenn., also proposed  
increasing the civil penalty for interfering with a flight crew 
from $1,100 to $25,000, and deputizing local law enforcement 
officials so they can arrest an unruly passenger when a plane is 
diverted, instead of further inconveniencing passengers by waiting 
for a federal official. 
</P>
<P>
	The people who most often encounter unruly passengers -- flight  
attendants -- cheered the proposals as they were unveiled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's apparent that the current penalty is not a sufficient  
deterrent because the number of incidents has increased in spite of 
some fairly high-profile cases where the maximum penalty has been 
applied,'' said Patricia Friend, president of the Association of 
Flight Attendants. The group represents 43,000 flight attendants at 
27 airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the government received reports of 296 unruly  
passengers; the number increased to 921 by 1997. In 1996, the 
Federal Aviation Administration imposed civil penalties against 121 
unruly passengers; in 1997, the number increased to 195. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current criminal law, passengers face up to 20 years in  
jail and a fine of $10,000 for interfering with a flight crew. They 
can be imprisoned for life if they use a weapon. Civil penalties 
are far less, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the increased number of reports, Reid said more serious  
action is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't a question of someone being rude to a stewardess or  
a steward,'' he said. ``This is a question of physical abuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid described a recent flight he took from Baltimore to Las  
Vegas that had to land in Omaha, Neb., after a passenger got in a 
fight with a flight attendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Frist also spoke from a firsthand perspective: In addition to  
being a senator, he's a doctor, a pilot with a commercial license 
and the husband of a former flight attendant. 
</P>
<P>
	``For night after night coming home from flying around the  
country, I would hear these stories,'' Frist said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is weighing a different bill that would also crack  
down on unruly passengers.

<HEADLINE> Charity Execs Accused of Stealing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Allegations that executives of the  
worldwide charity Feed The Children took home boxes of donated 
food, clothing and household goods are being investigated by state 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	After a four-month investigation, WTVF-TV broadcast video of  
charity executives, their assistants and their relatives using 
dollies to wheel boxes -- several at a time -- from a warehouse to 
their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	After being tipped by the station, Tennessee Bureau of  
Investigation agents on Monday raided a Nashville office of the 
charity and the homes of six administrative employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The agents carried out boxes and bags of brand-name clothing --  
some with tags still on -- shoes, videos, blankets and food they 
suspect were donated for the needy. One box had ``Merry Christmas 
to me'' written on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Highfill, executive director of Feed The Children's  
Nashville office, was one of the employees shown on the video. He 
told WTVF he saw nothing wrong with allowing administrative staff 
to take donated items. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're taking stuff home and giving their little brother a  
pair of shoes or some food, I don't have much to say about that,'' 
he said. ``If that's wrong, fine. I don't think so and I don't 
think people are going to think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feed The Children, founded in 1979, opened its Nashville  
warehouse in October 1996. The group said it is also checking into 
the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Feed The Children is shocked and saddened at this information.  
The video surveillance weighs heavy on my heart,'' said Larry 
Jones, president and founder of Feed The Children. He said that 
charity policy clearly prohibits employees from taking donated 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	WTVF's investigation began after workers at the warehouse told  
the station that administrative employees were using the warehouse 
as a personal shopping mall.

<HEADLINE> Analyst Urges Enforcing Truck Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Better law enforcement, improved data  
collection and attention from top transportation officials can 
improve truck and bus safety, according to an official who studied 
the commercial vehicle industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Norman Mineta, a California Democrat who once headed  
the House Transportation Committee, offered the suggestions 
Wednesday as he concluded a 90-day review of the Transportation 
Department and the federal Office of Motor Carriers, which oversees 
the safety of large commercial vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The review came in response to complaints that the motor carrier  
office is too soft on the trucking industry and at a time when a 
string of fatal bus accidents has raised concerns about safety. A 
crash in New Orleans on May 9 killed 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``Continuation of such fatality and injury trends is  
unacceptable, and therefore there has rightfully been a growing 
concern and resurgent call for increased attention to this issue,'' 
Mineta told the House Transportation's ground transportation 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	His eight recommendations:  
</P>
<P>
	--Increased surveillance, compliance and enforcement activities,  
including increased inspections by state and federal law 
enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increased truck inspections at the border with Mexico before  
Jan. 1, when the North American Free Trade Agreement will allow 
Mexican trucks to travel freely into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	--New motor carrier regulations, as well as a streamlining of the  
rule-making process. 
</P>
<P>
	--Improved safety data and information systems, especially  
pertaining to crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	--New motor carrier safety entry requirements because studies  
show that carriers with less than three years' experience have 
higher crash and lower safety compliance rates. 
</P>
<P>
	--New license training and testing programs, including a  
commercial learner's permit and apprentice driving program. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increased truck and bus crash-avoidance initiatives, including  
using devices to avoid collisions with passenger vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	--Greater attention by management to motor carrier issues,  
including adding ``motor carrier'' to the name of the Federal 
Highway Administration and hiring two top executives to oversee 
motor carrier safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Highway Administrator Ken Wykle, who also attended Wednesday's  
hearing, said he supported the recommendations and Mineta's 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Wykle and Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater  
announced a series of steps aimed at cutting the number of 
truck-related highway deaths in half over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the year for which the most current statistics are  
available, 5,355 people were killed in accidents involving trucks. 
In many cases, the accidents were caused not by truck drivers, but 
by motorists who cut in front of them, slammed into them or stopped 
in front of them.

<HEADLINE> Party Head Confirms Clinton's Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to form an  
exploratory committee for a Senate run in late June or early July, 
according to the head of New York's state Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairwoman Judith Hope also said Wednesday that Mrs. Clinton  
wants to spend part of this summer visiting families in upstate New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conversation last Friday, Hope said, Mrs. Clinton told her  
that after she returned from Florida, ``she's going to do a lot of 
first lady things, including going to Israel, and that if she is 
still leaning in the direction that she seems to be, which is 
toward making the race, she would expect to be creating an 
exploratory committee in late June or early July.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's top adviser, Harold Ickes, did not dispute Hope's  
comments, but cautioned the first lady has not made a final 
decision about the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week is a big week for her,'' Ickes said.  
</P>
<P>
	Aides to Mrs. Clinton have said that if she did set up an  
exploratory committee, it would mean she was almost certain to take 
the next step of entering the race. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with CBS' Dan Rather broadcast Wednesday on ``60  
Minutes II'' and taped last week, Mrs. Clinton said ``that would be 
the next step that I would take, if I go forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is eyeing the Senate seat being vacated next year  
by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. New York City Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani, among others, is looking at the race on the Republican 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	Hope's comments mark the first time one of the first lady's  
advisers has been willing to publicly talk about what Mrs. Clinton 
has told them concerning her intentions and her timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	The party leader said Mrs. Clinton called her Wednesday morning  
from Florida, where she is vacationing with the president, to ask 
for help in setting up this summer's visits. 
</P>
<P>
	``She seems very exuberant and very excited,'' Hope said. ``Her  
commitment seems to be increasing toward this.''

<HEADLINE> Board of Trade Sets Eurex Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Board of Trade leadership has given  
itself four weeks to convince reluctant members of the benefits of 
embracing a fast-growing all-electronic exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	As the world's largest futures exchange struggled to find  
direction against a sea of challengers, its board of directors set 
June 24 as the date that could prove key to its future. On that 
day, members will vote on a broad alliance with Frankfurt-based 
Eurex. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange on Thursday also announced other measures aimed at  
fending off competition, including slashing fees for large 
customers who want to trade electronically and lobbying federal 
regulators to relax restrictions the CBOT contends hamper growth of 
U.S. exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves highlight a startling about-face for the Board of  
Trade, which is in danger of losing its No. 1 ranking this year to 
Eurex. In January it chose a go-slow approach by sticking with the 
auction-style trading, known as open outcry, that many call an 
anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, exchange Chairman David P. Brennan called Eurex  
``the best business alternative'' and urged members to accept the 
alliance, which insiders say is virtually identical to the one they 
rejected nearly six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago exchange has not revealed details of the pairing,  
but news reports have indicated it involves giving up its 
electronic trading platform, known as Project A, in favor of 
Eurex's electronic platform and cross-trading each other's 
contracts over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Project A platform was a key sticking point in the previous  
failed alliance bid. Smaller traders, called locals, also have been 
reluctant to cede authority to outsiders and abandon a 150-year 
tradition. That intransigence has killed merger hopes with rival 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange several times. 
</P>
<P>
	But large trading firms appear to be gaining the upper hand in a  
power struggle at the Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Board members recently backed exchange President Thomas Donovan,  
an advocate of speedier change, after Brennan sought to have him 
removed. And the Board of Trade Clearing Corp. voted Wednesday to 
change the way its directors are elected, giving larger firms more 
power in decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
	Such large trading firms have migrated to computer-based  
trading, saying it is easier and cheaper because it saves keeping 
expensive staff at individual exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our members and customers told us what they want, and the  
board acted quickly and decisively to keep their business,'' 
Donovan said Thursday of the board's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the industry say U.S. exchanges must adopt electronic  
trading amid stiff competition from overseas exchanges and 
over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Exchanges in London and Paris clung to open outcry, only to find  
much of their business stolen away by Eurex. They now have been 
forced to cut jobs and seek alliances with Eurex to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Former exchange Chairman Patrick Arbor, who narrowly lost a  
re-election bid in December, had argued the Board of Trade must be 
prepared to end the open outcry system if it wanted to save many of 
the Chicago area's 150,000 futures industry jobs.

	Malone opened up a gash over Grant's right eye in the first  
quarter while Malone was going for a rebound. Grant lay on the 
floor in pain, and came back after getting six stitches. He was 
ineffective, however, scoring eight points on 1-of-7 shooting for 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, who didn't talk to the media after the game, said  
Wednesday that the hit was just part of a rough-and-tumble series. 
In fact, the cut represents what Grant wants to learn from Malone 
and the Utah Jazz: how to play with the intensity needed to win the 
biggest of games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he wasn't planning on elbowing me in the eye,'' Grant  
said. ``Even if it was intentional, that's part of the game. Those 
things are going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter, with the outcome decided, Grant was  
frustrated after Malone made a swipe at the ball. Grant faked a 
throw at the back of Malone's head, drawing a technical foul. That 
sent Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy into an uncharacteristic rage. 
</P>
<P>
	He stomped onto the court toward an official and, after being  
ejected, had to be restrained by assistant coaches and players. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Grant was in Malone's face, exchanging heated words  
with the future Hall of Famer. Malone said later that Grant had 
told him he disliked him. Malone said the feeling was mutual. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know where each other's coming from, and that's the way it  
is,'' Malone said. ``In the playoffs, you don't have to like me. I 
don't play this game for you to like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant said the substance of the obscenity-laced confrontation  
will stay a secret. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't about Brian Grant playing Karl Malone. It's about  
the Trail Blazers trying to win a championship this year,'' Grant 
said. ``I know we're not going to be able to do it with me 
bickering with one player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any ill feelings toward any of the Jazz. If  
anything, I can take a page from their book someday as far as how 
to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Game 5, Blazers teammate Isaiah Rider hinted that the team  
might bring a role player off the bench to take out Malone, a 
suggestion quickly shot down by Dunleavy and Grant. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not my approach,'' Grant said. ``I'm a ballplayer, not  
a wrestler. I'm not a fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blazers guard Damon Stoudamire said Grant was in a tough spot,  
having to show he won't back down without doing something that 
would get him thrown out of the game, or suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to focus and do the things he was doing up until this  
point,'' Stoudamire said. ``I don't think the Jazz are going to 
change up their game plan. They're going to come right after him, 
but Brian has to understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone was fined $10,000 by the NBA for elbowing Grant in the  
mouth in Game 1. As in Tuesday night's game, Malone was not 
whistled for a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does have a problem with his elbows,'' Dunleavy said. ``I  
don't want to make excuses. But if a guy continually hits people 
with elbows and they get cut, what does that tell you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rough play in Game 5 overshadowed an otherwise impressive  
performance by the Jazz, who say the pressure is now on the Blazers 
to win on their homecourt to avoid going back to Salt Lake City for 
Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they say they're not feeling a little pressure, I would say  
they're lying a little bit,'' Malone said. ``Because they're 
supposed to close us out because we're getting old, we can't do 
this, and we're predictable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz are trying to become the seventh team in NBA history to  
come back from a 3-1 deficit. The last to do it was the Miami Heat 
in 1997, against the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz have trailed 3-1 five times in the Malone-John Stockton  
era, and have yet to win a series. 
</P>
<P>
	But Utah is 6-1 the last two seasons when it had to win or go  
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not going to lay down,'' Grant said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin  
Netanyahu, trounced in elections earlier this month, quit politics 
Thursday but left the door open for a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu had resigned as leader of his Likud party 28 minutes  
after the polls closed on May 17. On Thursday, in an expected 
announcement, he said he would leave parliament as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will resign from the Knesset but in no way will I resign  
from the struggle for the future of Israel,'' he told central 
committee members of his Likud party at a gathering in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
	Likud members waved banners reading ``Bibi, don't quit,'' and  
chanted ``Bibi, we love you,'' referring to Netanyahu by his 
nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	The premier was visibly moved by the outpouring of warmth from  
some 500 Likud members who sang his name for eight minutes after he 
entered the conference hall. ``I thank each and every one of you 
from the bottom of my heart,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``God willing, we will make a comeback,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu's aides have said he plans to write a book and hit the  
U.S. lecture circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ariel Sharon, the hawkish outgoing foreign minister, was voted  
temporary chairman of Likud until primaries are held later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon's first move in the post was to appoint a committee to  
explore ways to rehabilitate a party electorally crushed and 
alienated from many of its traditional voters. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would let party members decide whether to join a  
coalition government led by Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak of the 
dovish Labor party. Labor has said it was giving Likud preferential 
status in coalition-building talks. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first political speech since a stunning election defeat,  
Netanyahu said his greatest achievements were demanding reciprocity 
in peace talks with the Palestinians and weakening Arab negotiating 
demands. Other accomplishments he mentioned included maintaining 
sovereignty over disputed areas of Jerusalem, protecting Jewish 
settlements on disputed territory and lowering inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Netanyahu for now has left the stage, but Netanyahu the  
politician will probably be back,'' said Hanan Christal, a 
political commentator for Israel TV. Christal is co-author of a new 
book that claims Netanyahu was suffering deep depression before the 
election and was desperately looking to save his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, ``Elections '99'' published in Israel on Thursday,  
alleges Netanyahu had planned to ignore opposition from military 
and security officials and send troops into the PLO headquarters in 
Jerusalem three days before the elections in an effort to win back 
right-wing voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move, involving the sensitive area of disputed Jerusalem,  
would have likely ignited an explosion of violence between Israelis 
and Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	A Supreme Court injunction prevented the closure.  
</P>
<P>
	The book, written by Christal and Ilan Kfir, a writer with the  
Maariv newspaper, claimed Netanyahu had planned several actions 
against Palestinian officials and members of the militant Hamas 
movement, including the assassination of Hamas spiritual leader 
Sheik Ahmed Yassin. The book said Shin Bet security chief Ami 
Ayalon torpedoed plans for the kidnapping of his Palestinian 
counterpart, who Netanyahu believed was behind terror attacks 
against Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu's senior aide David Bar-Illan dismissed the claims and  
said the book, which quotes unnamed sources, was simply the latest 
in an unending string of media attacks against the premier.

<HEADLINE> Exxon, Mobil To Vote on Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Shareholders of Exxon and Mobil will vote today on  
merging the oil giants in an $82.2 billion deal that would create 
the world's biggest company. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon directors agreed in December to acquire Mobil in a stock  
purchase that would combine the biggest U.S. oil companies and join 
two of the companies split up by the 1911 government breakup of 
John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is still awaiting approval from U.S. and European  
antitrust regulators, which the companies expect could be completed 
by the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect shareholders to approve the deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's in everyone's interest,'' said Keith Petersen of Salomon  
Smith Barney in New York, who predicted the deal will also pass 
antitrust muster if the companies agree to sell some gas stations 
where they compete head-to-head. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't exert undue influence on the retail market because  
most of the major oil companies don't own their own retail stations 
-- they're owned by individuals,'' Petersen said. ``And there's an 
excess of refining capacity, which is why they're having negative 
operating margins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of the two companies were scheduled to meet at  
separate Dallas hotels this morning, and the chief executives -- Lee 
R. Raymond of Exxon and Lucio A. Noto of Mobil -- were planning a 
celebratory news conference after the twin votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to lead to the loss of about 9,000 jobs -- 7  
percent of the companies' worldwide work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would be called Exxon Mobil Corp. and have  
headquarters in Irving, Exxon's current home. Mobil is based in 
Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	If the merger is approved, Mobil shareholders will get 1.32  
shares of the new company's stock for each share of Mobil common 
stock. Exxon shareholders would keep their existing shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon shareholders would own about 70 percent of the new  
company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Trade Commission officials have said they are  
particularly interested in how the merger would affect competition 
in the Northeast, Gulf Coast and California, where the two 
companies compete head-to-head in refining and retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials say the two companies control more than 15  
percent of the branded retail gasoline stations in the Northeast 
and about 18 percent of the Gulf Coast's refining capacity.

<HEADLINE> Senators Seek Tougher Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican and Democratic senators want the  
Food and Drug Administration to increase inspections of imported 
foods, which have been blamed for thousands of cases of illness. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Democratic Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts,  
Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Richard Durbin of Illinois 
proposed a requirement that food imported to the United States be 
produced, prepared and packed under conditions that keep it as safe 
as food that is domestically produced. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA, which has responsibility for the safety of most food  
imports, and the Health and Human Services Department would be 
responsible for determining that countries have such ``equivalent'' 
food safety systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of establishing such systems would be borne by overseas  
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Citizens deserve to know that the food they eat is safe and  
wholesome, regardless of its source,'' said Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grocery Manufacturers of America immediately criticized the  
proposal as erecting unnecessary barriers to free trade. It said it 
could unfairly halt all imports from a country instead of targeting 
offending companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well-intentioned but misdirected proposals like these will do  
little to increase the safety of the food supply,'' said Stacey 
Zawel of the grocery manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Another bill, by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, would also give  
the FDA greater authority to detain or destroy suspect shipments 
and would increase the number of inspectors who check food at U.S. 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA inspects less than 2 percent of imports. The Agriculture  
Department inspects meat, eggs and poultry and has equivalency 
agreements with those who export those foods to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins hasn't proposed any equivalency requirements for fruits,  
vegetables or other foods under FDA's jurisdiction, saying such 
mandates would be unworkable. The grocery manufacturers said 
Collins' bill is ``headed in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Incidents of food-borne illness have gained attention as imports  
have increased. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the United States imported $7.2 billion worth of fruit  
and vegetables from at least 90 different countries, up from the 
1990 level of $4.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total food imports increased from 1.1 million shipments in 1992  
to 2.7 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Outbreaks of illness linked to imports include more than 1,000  
people sickened in 1997 by the parasite cyclospora on Guatemalan 
raspberries. That same year, children in five states became ill 
with hepatitis A after eating strawberries from a Mexican farm 
where workers had little access to sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Federation of America, which supports the  
Democratic bill, said 9,000 people die each year from food 
poisoning, but it didn't say how many of those deaths were 
attributable to imports.

<HEADLINE> Acting Company Performs 'Tartuffe' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Acting Company has a strong concept for a  
new take on Moliere's ``Tartuffe,'' but most of the young actors 
don't excel in their roles. 
</P>
<P>
	The play's title character is a religious fraud, who uses his  
charisma to dazzle the character Orgon and hoodwink Orgon into 
giving him the deed to his house and disinheriting his son. 
</P>
<P>
	But director Mark Ax takes the emphasis off clerical greed and  
conniving and places it on the harm to Orgon's family, in the 
production running at the off-Broadway Playhouse at St. Clement's. 
Not only is Orgon's son sent away but Tartuffe gets Orgon to tell 
his daughter she must marry Tartuffe instead of the young man she 
loves. And Tartuffe attempts to rape Orgon's wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The wife puts Orgon under a table to witness his advances, which  
Tartuffe has hinted at. Orgon sits frozen under the table so long 
the attempted rape gets quite far along. 
</P>
<P>
	Ax was assistant director when Garland Wright, who taught  
directing at the Juilliard School, directed ``Tartuffe'' there in 
1998, his final work before he died. A program note states that Ax 
is following Wright's ideas about the play. 
</P>
<P>
	The most effective acting in the cast was by Rayme Cornell as  
Orgon's wife. This graduate of the University of Missouri has an 
inner electricity which makes the stage brighten when she is 
present. Andrew McGinn's Orgon was properly awed by Tartuffe. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Jean plays Tartuffe. He needs to show a face of  
religious devotion to Orgon and somehow convey to the audience that 
he's a hypocrite and quite aware of it. At this point in his 
career, Jean is capable only of presenting the former, and this 
lessens the play's humor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Acting Company was formed in 1972 from the first graduating  
class of the Juilliard School's Drama Division. It tours a great 
deal, mainly to smaller cities. The company now is made up of young 
actors from a number of schools.

<HEADLINE>  Manchester United's Win for Ages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Manchester United has lifted English soccer back  
to the summit of Europe after a long, hard climb. And with their 
historic triple crown season, the Reds are being hailed as possibly 
the greatest English team ever. 
</P>
<P>
	United etched its place in English soccer folklore by beating  
Bayern Munich 2-1 in Barcelona on Wednesday night to win the 
European Champions Cup -- the world's most prestigious club title. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most dramatic finishes in cup history, United came  
from behind to win with two goals in the final 90 seconds of injury 
time by substitutes Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory completed an unprecedented sweep by an English club  
of the domestic league, F.A. Cup and European Cup titles in the 
same season -- something that even the great Liverpool teams of the 
late 1970s and early '80s never accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	British newspapers hailed the win as one of the greatest moments  
in English soccer history, with the Daily Mirror headline even 
calling it ``The Greatest 2 Minutes in the History of Sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of fans poured into the streets of Manchester to  
celebrate Wednesday night, and the city was turned into a sea of 
red -- the team's color -- Thursday night as men, women and children 
turned out to greet their heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans climbed lamp-posts and any available vantage points along  
the route to get a better view as manager Alex Ferguson and his 
players rode through the city in an open-top double-decker bus. 
</P>
<P>
	It took nearly four hours for the bus to wind its way through  
the masses on its seven-mile route from the outskirts of the city 
to the downtown Manchester indoor arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Car horns, whistles and the ``Glory Glory Man United'' anthem  
filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of the crowd was estimated at anywhere from 400,000 to  
750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson and the players stood atop the bus, waving to the  
crowds and holding up the three trophies. The European Cup was 
propped up front like a huge hood ornament. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the bus neared the city center, the route of the  
parade along the shopping street of Deansgate was packed. So many 
red-shirted supporters were waiting to welcome the team that police 
appealed for fans to stay away from the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson's team became the first United club to lift the  
European trophy since since 1968, when Matt Busby was manager and 
George Best and Bobby Charlton were the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	That triumph came 10 years after the Munich air crash which  
killed eight players of the United team known as the ``Busby 
Babes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a powerful piece of symbolism, United's triumph Wednesday  
came on what would have been Busby's 90th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlton, who survived the Munich crash and is now a senior  
director of the club, wiped away tears as he watched the team's 
celebrations Wednesday night from the stands of the Camp Nou 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also helped erase some of the memories of another  
dark chapter in English soccer history. In 1985, 39 people died 
when English hooligans rioted before the Liverpool-Juventus 
European Cup final at Brussels' Heysel stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy resulted in English clubs being banned from European  
competition for five years. Since the ban was lifted, Manchester 
United (1991), Arsenal (1994) and Chelsea (1998) won the Cup 
Winners Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But, until this season, no English club had managed to progress  
to the Champions Cup final. The win over Bayern means English clubs 
are now tied with Italian sides with the most European Cup 
victories (9). 
</P>
<P>
	``English football has been in the wilderness for a long time  
and now we're back on the world stage,'' Charlton said. ``It's been 
all right saying English football is the healthiest and the best to 
watch, but you really need to have something to show for it and to 
win the Champions League, there's nothing bigger in world club 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Debate is already raging on whether this Manchester United team,  
which has won the Premier League title in five of the past seven 
seasons, is the greatest English club of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparisons are being made to the 1958 and 1968 United teams and  
to the Liverpool teams which won the European Cup four times (1977, 
1978, 1981 and 1984). Bob Paisley was the Liverpool manager during 
that era and his star players included Kenny Dalglish and Graeme 
Souness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always said we would never be judged as a great team until  
we had won the Champions League,'' winger Ryan Giggs said. ``We've 
done that now and I think we deserve to be ranked along with the 
Liverpool teams of the 80s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the credit goes to Ferguson, the 57-year-old Scot whose  
achievements rank alongside those of Paisley, Busby, Bill Shankly 
and Jock Stein. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson has claimed 12 major trophies since taking over at  
United in 1986 -- five league championships, four F.A. Cups, one 
league Cup, one Champions Cup and one Cup Winners Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	That total puts Ferguson only one behind Paisley, who won 13  
trophies at Liverpool. Ferugson also won 10 major trophies with 
Aberdeen, bringing his career total to 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson may soon become ``Sir Alex.'' It's now widely expected  
that he will receive a knighthood -- an honor that also went to 
Busby.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Try To Protect Surpluses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation passed by the House would make it  
harder for lawmakers to spend government surpluses coming from 
Social Security taxes. But it leaves unresolved how the nation's 
retirement system ultimately will accommodate an onslaught of aging 
baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could we do more? Sure. But this is the first step,'' said  
Rep. Wally Herger, R-Calif., who drafted the Republican-sponsored 
bill that cleared the House by a 416-12 vote on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most House Democrats voted for the legislation, saying it  
couldn't hurt. But they called it little more than a political 
gambit by Republicans seeking to protect their party's flanks on a 
volatile social issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an empty gesture designed to fool the American people  
into thinking something has been done for Social Security,'' said 
Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's budget surplus, expected to be $80 billion to $110  
billion, will come entirely from Social Security taxes. Under 
current projections, income tax surpluses aren't anticipated until 
after 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The House GOP legislation would forbid Congress or the president  
from including Social Security surpluses in their budgeting for 
other programs or for tax cuts. Instead, they would have to be used 
to pay down the government's debt to private bondholders -- 
something economists say could help promote economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate votes on the House floor would be required for most  
exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers could tap the money to help prepare Social Security or  
Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly, for a cash 
shortfall expected after baby boomers, now in middle age, retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Skepticism has been growing, however, that Congress can pass a  
full-scale overhaul of the retirement programs in the politically 
charged year and a half before the 2000 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP drive to formally wall off Social Security surpluses is,  
in part, a fall-back plan to counter Democrats' accusations that 
Republicans want to spend on tax cuts money that could help shore 
up the nation's retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion polls, including polling by the Republican  
National Committee, indicate that Americans, by a double-digit 
margin, consider Democrats more likely than Republicans to make the 
right decisions about Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, RNC polling found that legislation to  
safeguard Social Security surplus dollars offered some cover, 
commanding strong support, with 87 percent of Americans in favor. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is unclear whether the GOP strategy can succeed.  
</P>
<P>
	A Senate version of the legislation is opposed by Democrats  
there, and the Clinton administration has threatened a veto. It 
would lower the government's statutory debt limit, which 
administration officials say could hinder borrowing flexibility the 
Treasury Department needs in times of economic trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	And already, the conflict in Yugoslavia, with its $9  
billion-and-growing price tag, suggests that lawmakers are sure to 
face necessary -- or at least tempting -- exceptions to any new 
spending restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Democrats are challenging Republicans to set aside  
even more money, from expected income tax surpluses, for Medicare. 
The Clinton administration wants about $700 billion over 15 years 
for Medicare -- close to the same amount Republicans have budgeted 
for tax cuts.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Creates Diversity Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola, facing a racial discrimination  
lawsuit, has established a council to work on diversifying its 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	M. Douglas Ivester, chairman and chief executive officer, sent  
an e-mail memo to employees Wednesday saying the Diversity Advisory 
Council will help ``assure that we are able to achieve our 
different, better and special standard and to maximize the benefits 
of diversity in our work force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heading the new council will be Carl Ware, a company senior vice  
president who heads Coke's Africa Group, and Jack Stahl, senior 
vice president and head of the North America Group. Ware is Coke's 
senior black executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The council will begin meeting soon, Coke spokesman Robert  
Baskin said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivester has denied that the company discriminates. But he said  
in the e-mail that he also plans to hold periodic meetings with 
small groups of employees to ``increase my own efforts to open the 
lines of communication with all constituencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One former and three current black salaried employees sued Coke  
last month, claiming that the company discriminated against black 
employees in pay, promotions, performance evaluations and 
terminations. 
</P>
<P>
	They are seeking class-action status, which would add as  
plaintiffs all 1,500 salaried black employees who work for the 
company nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We welcome the establishment of the diversity council,'' said  
Cyrus Mehri, a Washington attorney for the plaintiffs. ``However, 
it should have been established four years ago, and it will not be 
fully effective without input from the plaintiffs and the other 
salaried black employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ware told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he and three  
other black executives at Coke met in 1995 and made recommendations 
on improving opportunities for blacks, at the request of 
then-president Ivester. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not where we want to be, because we have set a high  
standard,'' Ware said. ``But I think this company is working hard 
to improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' lawyers had expressed concern about two e-mails  
Ivester sent to nearly 10,000 Coke employees soon after the suit 
was filed, saying they could intimidate potential class members. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Story ruled last week that Coca-Cola  
executives may continue sending e-mails to employees about the 
case, as long as they make it clear that employees are free to join 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Baskin said the latest memo wasn't about the lawsuit, but about  
``diversity at the company.''

<HEADLINE> Auschwitz Crosses Hassle Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSWIECIM, Poland (AP) -- A conservative Catholic who rallied  
others to erect crosses near the Auschwitz Nazi death camp said 
Thursday he put explosive devices in a hut near the crosses to 
prevent it from being demolished. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazimierz Switon said he mined the wooden hut and the nearby  
tent he has been living in a day after the local municipality 
ordered the hut torn down because it was built illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	The order was issued under a law that took effect Tuesday that  
allows the state to take control of a 100-yard band surrounding 
former Nazi camps throughout Poland. That band includes the 
property where the wooden hut and the 300 crosses are standing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to safeguard myself. I don't have any other way,''  
Switon said by cellular telephone from the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The 68-year-old Switon has threatened to set himself on fire if  
a 26-foot wooden cross from a 1979 papal mass at the Birkenau 
extermination camp is removed from the lot next to Auschwitz, as 
demanded by Jewish groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The cross was erected on the lot in 1988 to honor 152 Polish  
Catholics slain there by the Nazis in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic church and the government have called this  
week for the removal of the smaller crosses, but say the papal 
cross should remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Jews say the crosses violate the memory of more than 1 million  
Jews who died in Auschwitz-Birkenau. 
</P>
<P>
	Switon last year urged conservative Catholics to plant the  
smaller crosses next to the papal cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Switon also oversaw construction of the wooden hut, which was  
consecrated as a chapel by a retired priest May 16, without Church 
approval.

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Bootlegs Sold in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Pirated copies of the ``Star Wars'' prequel --  
with washed out desert scenes and noise from a theater's audience -- 
have hit stores in Asia, after the film opened in the United States 
and before its Asia debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirated video CDs of ``Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace''  
are widely available in shopping malls in Hong Kong for between $3 
and $4, a fraction of the cost of movie tickets. In Beijing, street 
vendors were sold out. 
</P>
<P>
	Roadside vendors in Malaysia and at least one store in Jakarta,  
Indonesia, were also selling the discs. 
</P>
<P>
	All copies sold in Hong Kong appeared to be from the same  
source: a home video recorded in a U.S. movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget about computer-generated special effects, a main selling  
point of the latest ``Star Wars'' installment. The video is dark 
and fuzzy, and the sound quality is poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the scenes -- especially those in space -- are almost  
black, while the desert scenes are so bright they appear washed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very bad copy. You can see the back of people's heads  
moving and hear them talking and shouting,'' said Sam Ho, the 
director of the Motion Pictures Association's Hong Kong and Macau 
anti-piracy operation unit. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as the ``Star Wars'' logo appears on screen and the  
familiar soundtrack begins, the audience in the theater can be 
heard cheering wildly. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Leung, acting deputy head of Hong Kong Customs Department's  
intellectual property investigation section, said customs officials 
were working with the film's Hong Kong distributor, 20th Century 
Fox, on further action. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman at 20th Century Fox refused comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The film opens in Asia Friday at a charity event in Singapore.

<HEADLINE>  Manchester United's Win for Ages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Manchester United has lifted English soccer back  
to the summit of Europe after a long, hard climb. And with their 
historic triple crown season, the Reds are being hailed as possibly 
the greatest English team ever. 
</P>
<P>
	United etched its place in English soccer folklore by beating  
Bayern Munich 2-1 in Barcelona on Wednesday night to win the 
European Champions Cup -- the world's most prestigious club title. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most dramatic finishes in cup history, United came  
from behind to win with two goals in the final 90 seconds of injury 
time by substitutes Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory completed an unprecedented sweep by an English club  
of the domestic league, F.A. Cup and European Cup titles in the 
same season -- something that even the great Liverpool teams of the 
late 1970s and early '80s never accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	British newspapers hailed the win as one of the greatest moments  
in English soccer history, with the Daily Mirror headline even 
calling it ``The Greatest 2 Minutes in the History of Sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of fans poured into the streets of Manchester to  
celebrate Wednesday night, and the city was turned into a sea of 
red -- the team's color -- Thursday night as men, women and children 
turned out to greet their heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans climbed lamp-posts and any available vantage points along  
the route to get a better view as manager Alex Ferguson and his 
players rode through the city in an open-top double-decker bus. 
</P>
<P>
	It took nearly four hours for the bus to wind its way through  
the masses on its seven-mile route from the outskirts of the city 
to the downtown Manchester indoor arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Car horns, whistles and the ``Glory Glory Man United'' anthem  
filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of the crowd was estimated at anywhere from 400,000 to  
750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson and the players stood atop the bus, waving to the  
crowds and holding up the three trophies. The European Cup was 
propped up front like a huge hood ornament. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the bus neared the city center, the route of the  
parade along the shopping street of Deansgate was packed. So many 
red-shirted supporters were waiting to welcome the team that police 
appealed for fans to stay away from the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson's team became the first United club to lift the  
European trophy since since 1968, when Matt Busby was manager and 
George Best and Bobby Charlton were the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	That triumph came 10 years after the Munich air crash which  
killed eight players of the United team known as the ``Busby 
Babes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a powerful piece of symbolism, United's triumph Wednesday  
came on what would have been Busby's 90th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlton, who survived the Munich crash and is now a senior  
director of the club, wiped away tears as he watched the team's 
celebrations Wednesday night from the stands of the Camp Nou 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also helped erase some of the memories of another  
dark chapter in English soccer history. In 1985, 39 people died 
when English hooligans rioted before the Liverpool-Juventus 
European Cup final at Brussels' Heysel stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy resulted in English clubs being banned from European  
competition for five years. Since the ban was lifted, Manchester 
United (1991), Arsenal (1994) and Chelsea (1998) won the Cup 
Winners Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But, until this season, no English club had managed to progress  
to the Champions Cup final. The win over Bayern means English clubs 
are now tied with Italian sides with the most European Cup 
victories (9). 
</P>
<P>
	``English football has been in the wilderness for a long time  
and now we're back on the world stage,'' Charlton said. ``It's been 
all right saying English football is the healthiest and the best to 
watch, but you really need to have something to show for it and to 
win the Champions League, there's nothing bigger in world club 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Debate is already raging on whether this Manchester United team,  
which has won the Premier League title in five of the past seven 
seasons, is the greatest English club of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparisons are being made to the 1958 and 1968 United teams and  
to the Liverpool teams which won the European Cup four times (1977, 
1978, 1981 and 1984). Bob Paisley was the Liverpool manager during 
that era and his star players included Kenny Dalglish and Graeme 
Souness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always said we would never be judged as a great team until  
we had won the Champions League,'' winger Ryan Giggs said. ``We've 
done that now and I think we deserve to be ranked along with the 
Liverpool teams of the 80s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the credit goes to Ferguson, the 57-year-old Scot whose  
achievements rank alongside those of Paisley, Busby, Bill Shankly 
and Jock Stein. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson has claimed 12 major trophies since taking over at  
United in 1986 -- five league championships, four F.A. Cups, one 
league Cup, one Champions Cup and one Cup Winners Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	That total puts Ferguson only one behind Paisley, who won 13  
trophies at Liverpool. Ferugson also won 10 major trophies with 
Aberdeen, bringing his career total to 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson may soon become ``Sir Alex.'' It's now widely expected  
that he will receive a knighthood -- an honor that also went to 
Busby.

<HEADLINE> SLOC Picks Torch Relay Coordinator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The company that spearheaded the Atlanta  
and Nagano Olympic torch relays and will organize the event in 
Sydney has been selected to orchestrate the torch relay for the 
2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations are under way to finalize the deal with ALEM  
International Inc., but the company, based in Boulder, Colo., on 
Thursday agreed in principle to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The size and scope of the torch relay for the Salt Lake City  
games will depend on what kind of corporate backing the event can 
rally, said Shelley Thomas, vice president of communication and 
public affairs for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The torch could travel through as few as five states or,  
theoretically, through all 50, depending on how much financial 
support sponsors are willing to give. A route should be settled on 
by the end of the summer, along with a means of selecting 
torchbearers. In Atlanta, United Way selected ``heroes'' along the 
route to carry the torch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The torch relay is an event that brings the Olympic spirit to  
people across the country and around the world,'' Thomas said. 
``The flame is one of the most recognizable symbols of the Olympic 
Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the 1996 games, ALEM organized an 84-day journey for the  
torch, reaching from Los Angeles to Atlanta, covering 15,000 miles 
and 43 states. Some 12,500 people carried the torch and were 
supported by more than 40 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The relay becomes this rolling picture postcard of everything  
that's great about the Olympics,'' said Steven McCarthy, president 
and chairman of ALEM. 
</P>
<P>
	The first torch relay took place at the Berlin Olympics in 1936.  
It was inspired by ancient Greek drawings and writings.

<HEADLINE> Missing Atheist Aide Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A man authorities say killed Madalyn Murray  
O'Hair, her son and granddaughter out of hatred and greed pleaded 
guilty today to two federal weapons charges unrelated to the 
atheist leader's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	David R. Waters, 53, a former office manager for Mrs. O'Hair,  
faces up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines on each count. 
He will be sentenced July 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters, convicted of murder in Illinois in 1965, has not been  
charged in the September 1995 disappearances. Mrs. O'Hair, Jon 
Garth Murray, and Robin Murray O'Hair vanished from San Antonio in 
September 1995, along with $500,000 in gold coins. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters was on probation for skimming $54,000 from the O'Hair  
family's atheist organizations when police searched his Austin 
apartment March 25. Police said they found 119 rounds of handgun 
ammunition. Waters has been in custody since then. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in Austin indicted Waters in April as a  
felon in possession of firearm ammunition and transporting firearms 
from Texas to Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Daryl Fields, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in San  
Antonio, declined to comment on the investigation or whether it was 
related to the O'Hair disappearances. 
</P>
<P>
	In an Internal Revenue Service affidavit unsealed Wednesday,  
authorities said Waters orchestrated a plot to steal at least 
$600,000 from Ms. O'Hair's United Secularists of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The document, the first official account of the disappearances,  
says motives of money and hatred drove Waters to commit the 
killings and bury the three in a Texas field. 
</P>
<P>
	The document, citing a confidential informant, also states  
Waters had a deep hatred for the woman whose 1963 U.S. Supreme 
Court case, along with a ruling the previous year, struck down 
organized prayer in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Waters ... expressed fantasies of killing Madalyn,'' the  
affidavit states. ``He spoke about seeing Madalyn suffer and 
snipping off her toes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waters' lawyer, Patrick Ganne, said: ``What it looks like to me  
is a script for Oliver Stone's next movie. They don't have any 
direct evidence to link him. It is all speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the O'Hairs vanished, authorities wondered whether they  
were victims of foul play or had merely run off with their 
organization's money. Others suggested that Mrs. O'Hair, who was 77 
and ailing, had gone off to die quietly so Christians wouldn't pray 
over her. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities, however, have recently suggested the O'Hairs'  
remains were buried in barrels, but two recent searches of a ranch 
near San Antonio failed to find either barrels or bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit from IRS special agent Edmund Martin names Waters,  
along with Gary Karr, now imprisoned in Detroit; Danny Fry, who was 
killed shortly after the O'Hairs vanished; and Gerald Lee Osborne 
of Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit was used in March to obtain a search warrant of  
Waters' Austin apartment. The search yielded, among other items, 
personal correspondence of Jon Murray, the document said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agent also stated that Waters was responsible for the death  
of Fry, whose headless, handless body was dumped in Dallas County 
two days after the O'Hairs vanished.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Want In On Regional Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Airlines want to fly more of the regional jets  
that are increasingly popular with travelers, but there's likely to 
be turbulence ahead as they wrangle with pilots unions about 
control and wage parity. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines this week became the latest carrier to seek  
union permission to sharply increase regional jet purchases, 
presenting its case to the Air Line Pilots Association's regional 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Airlines are ordering them in large numbers because the  
customer clearly likes them over turboprops,'' United spokesman Joe 
Hopkins said Thursday. ``Since regional jets are important feeders 
into our hub cities, we do want to maintain parity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regional jets usually seat no more than 70 people and have  
become popular tools for airlines to ferry consumers from small- 
and medium-size cities to large airports. Passengers prefer those 
planes over noisy turboprops because of their speed and perceived 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots unions, however, worry about what an increased emphasis  
on regional jets will mean for the future and fear airlines will 
use such jets to replace larger planes, which pilots are paid more 
to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest pilots went out on strike last year in part over  
concerns of losing pilot jobs because Northwest was buying and 
leasing smaller regional jets to Mesaba Airlines, its Airlink 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviation analysts say unions must realize the disadvantages of  
limiting regional jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have more (regional jet) feeds, then you have more  
traffic that can fill up your aircraft,'' said Brian Harris at 
Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots unions for United, American Airlines, Northwest Airlines,  
Trans World Airlines and US Airways earlier this decade negotiated 
contracts that limit the number of regional jets a carrier or its 
contract subsidiary can fly. Such agreements are called ``scope 
clauses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America West, Delta Air Lines and Continental do not limit the  
number of regional jets, although they do have restrictions on the 
number of seats on a plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Elk Grove Village-based United proposed allowing its commuter  
partners to fly up to 284 small jets instead of 65. The plan comes 
as a new study commissioned by more than a dozen airports warned 
that labor's restrictions on such moves hamper competition in 
smaller cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by GKMG, a Washington-based airline consulting group  
concluded 1,452 unserved markets could sustain regional jet service 
but restrictions bar service to 800 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Line Pilots Association criticized the report, noting  
that many of the airlines base their decisions about flying 
regional jets on the potential for profits rather than whether a 
city can support service. 
</P>
<P>
	Major carriers handle commuter jet service in different ways,  
requiring decisions to be made on a case-by-case basis, said Capt. 
Madison Walton, a spokesman for United's pilots union chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines owns its commuter jet division, while  
Northwest owns the planes and leases them to others and Delta has a 
stake in its commuter partners. 
</P>
<P>
	United contracts with regional carriers that operate under the  
United Express banner, agreements that could leave the majority 
employee-owned carrier vulnerable at the end of those contracts, 
Walton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an acknowledgment of the value of feeds into our hubs  
being able to grow the airline,'' he said. ``But the concern is 
that the Express carriers basically have control, and the economics 
of whether we should continue that, buy our own planes with 
corporate capital or take a greater (financial) interest in Express 
carriers has to be considered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walton said the pilots' Master Executive Council had no  
timetable for making a decision on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier hopes to reach agreement by March, the deadline for  
United Express carriers to exercise delivery options for additional 
regional jets.

<HEADLINE> Reno Knocks Aides on China Wiretap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno faulted Justice  
Department and FBI subordinates today for not coming to her two 
years ago with their disagreement over whether to wiretap a nuclear 
weapons scientist suspected of spying for China. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where there is something serious, where (FBI) Director (Louis)  
Freeh disagrees with the findings (of Justice officials), I think 
that it should be discussed at my level,'' Reno told her weekly 
news conference. ``I was not briefed on the details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno delivered her most detailed explanation yet of how the  
Justice Department handled allegations that a Taiwanese-born 
scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory may have given 
nuclear weapons secrets to China. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno's comments came after aides pleaded with her to rebut  
suggestions from Republican Richard Shelby of Alabama, the Senate 
intelligence committee chairman, and Democratic Sen. Robert 
Torricelli of New Jersey, usually a staunch defender of the Clinton 
administration, that she should resign or consider doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	National Security Adviser Samuel Berger also defended himself  
against accusations he wasn't aggressive enough when Energy 
Department officials briefed him in 1996 about security lapses at a 
weapons laboratory. Berger did not brief President Clinton on the 
matter until a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said that when he was told about two cases in 1996, he  
saw to it that the Energy Department expanded its probe and the FBI 
launched its own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did take it seriously. I did act. I believe I acted in  
national interest,'' Berger said on PBS' ``NewsHour With Jim 
Lehrer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When investigators returned in 1997 with more detailed  
information about broader and more systematic problems, Berger said 
he then briefed Clinton. ``We swiftly acted to implement the most 
sweeping reforms of counterintelligence in the labs in history,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno explained that when the FBI first sought in 1997 to wiretap  
the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, the warrant application was rejected by 
Justice's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review. Working with 
Justice officials, the FBI reworked the application twice to add 
information, but it was still rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Through his attorney, Lee has denied spying. Lee was fired this  
spring and remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the facts reported to us in 1997, the department  
determined that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding 
of probable cause'' to believe Lee engaged in clandestine 
intelligence-gathering on behalf of a foreign power, Reno said. 
That is the standard required by the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act of 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said then-Assistant FBI Director John Lewis complained  
about that decision to her without going into details, so she asked 
Justice's Executive Office for National Security to review it. 
Daniel Seikaly of that office agreed with the earlier decision and 
told the FBI, Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seikaly never took the matter up with Reno or Deputy Attorney  
General Eric Holder, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I assumed since I did not hear again from the FBI that it was  
resolved to their satisfaction,'' Reno said. Freeh has never been 
shy about appealing department rulings to Reno, as Justice 
officials noted privately. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking back now at the evidence available in 1997, the career  
lawyers were correct to reject the wiretap, Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the continuing disagreement had been brought to her, she  
said, ``I would have asked the FBI to go back and look at their 
records to see if there was additional information that could be 
utilized to show probable cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what the end result would have been, but I do  
know we would have ... done everything we could to see if probable 
cause could be developed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI itself had some reservations about whether the evidence  
was sufficient, according to a senior bureau official, who 
requested anonymity. Agents basically had three facts: the Energy 
Department listed Lee among officials who had access to W-88 
nuclear warhead data obtained by China, Lee had traveled to China 
to give lectures, and he had once telephoned another laboratory 
scientist under suspicion of spying, this official has said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Republican congressional source said FBI officials left  
the impression on Capitol Hill that they felt they did have 
probable cause. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998 the FBI mounted a ``false flag'' operation in which  
undercover FBI agents posed as Chinese spies and tried to get Lee 
to spy for them, but Lee would not, according to other law 
enforcement officials. And Lee's wife reported that contact to U.S. 
authorities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she has not thought about resigning and was told by  
White House Counsel Charles Ruff that she has Clinton's confidence. 
She has named a senior career prosecutor to review the Lee case.

<HEADLINE> Sallie Mae Buys New England Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sallie Mae, the nation's largest financer of  
student loans, announced today is buying Nellie Mae Corp., a New 
England student loan maker, for $320 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first major acquisition by Sallie Mae since the  
former government-sponsored company became private two years ago 
amid a bitter battle between management and dissident shareholders, 
who eventually took control. 
</P>
<P>
	Nellie Mae, with offices in Braintree, Mass., and Rumford, R.I.,  
is the seventh-largest holder of federal student loans with a 
portfolio valued at $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the merger agreement, Nellie Mae will become a subsidiary  
of Reston, Va.-based Sallie Mae and will retain its New England 
operations and regional sales offices across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the deal, Sallie Mae will be making more than $1  
billion a year in loans for study at nearly 250 colleges and 
universities by next year, Albert Lord, Sallie Mae's chief 
executive officer and vice chairman, told reporters in a telephone 
conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	``It fits right into our strategy ... of expanding our presence  
on campus,'' said Paul Carey, executive vice president of Sallie 
Mae. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger must be approved by the Justice Department and  
Massachusetts' attorney general. Sallie Mae officials said they 
expect it to be completed by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased to combine resources with Sallie Mae to  
continue to build the premier full-service education finance 
company,'' Lawrence O'Toole, president and CEO of Nellie Mae, said 
in a statement. He said the combination would enhance Nellie Mae's 
ability ``to serve our campus-based clients, students and family 
borrowers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officially named the Student Loan Marketing Association, Sallie  
Mae formerly benefitted from its status as a federally sponsored 
enterprise by borrowing at below-market interest rates with 
government guarantees to buy loans from banks. As a fully private 
company it now competes with banks -- its former clients -- by making 
loans directly to students and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Sallie Mae currently holds and manages $47 billion in student  
loans for more than 5 million borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of its parent company, SLM Holding Corp., were down 6 1/4  
cents to $41.06 1/4 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Blazers' Grant Wins Community Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Portland Trail Blazers forward Brian Grant  
received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award on Thursday for 
his community service and charity work. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant was selected for the honor by the Professional Basketball  
Writers Association. Other finalists were Atlanta center Dikembe 
Mutombo and Detroit forward Jerome Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, 27, is in his second season with the Trail Blazers and  
fifth in the NBA. He averaged 11.5 points and 9.8 rebounds in 48 
games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He has provided meals to the homeless and bought Christmas  
presents for underprivileged children. He also has purchased 25 
seats for children at each home game, and ran a free basketball 
clinic last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant wears the word ``Dash'' on his basketball shoes, in memory  
of Dash Thomas, a 12-year-old boy with brain cancer whom Grant 
befriended last fall. Thomas died Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The J. Walter Kennedy Award is named for the late NBA  
commissioner who held the job from 1963-75. Wes Unseld won the 
first award in 1975, and other winners include Julius Erving, Bob 
Lanier, Isiah Thomas, Magic Johnson and Joe Dumars.

<HEADLINE> Former Padres Pitcher Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Former San Diego Padres pitcher John D'Acquisto  
was sentenced to four years and seven months in federal prison 
Thursday for defrauding investors of about $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Acquisto, already serving time for a 1996 conviction in New  
York, pleaded guilty on March 1 to wire fraud and money laundering 
in a scheme in which he persuaded investors to put millions of 
dollars into business entities he controlled. 
</P>
<P>
	He falsely represented to those investors that several hundred  
million dollars was put in programs that could provide returns of 5 
to 7 1/2 percent per week. 
</P>
<P>
	He also generated false investment transaction reports, which  
claimed that some investments had grown by millions of dollars. In 
fact, little or no funds had been invested on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Acquisto used the money to buy three race horses, a $70,000  
Porsche, a contingent interest in a Mexican minor league baseball 
team and vacant land in Mexico, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment scheme was not D'Acquisto's first. In 1996, he  
was sentenced to five years, three months in prison after he was 
convicted of attempting to open a trading account at Prudential 
Securities Inc. in New York by presenting a forged $200 million 
certificate of deposit. He was later indicted on the California 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Acquisto talked big-money transactions for years, and once  
said he could write a check to buy the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	He pitched for the Padres from 1977 to 1980, and also played for  
San Francisco, St. Louis and Oakland. He finished with a career 
record of 34-51, with his best season being a 12-14 mark with San 
Francisco in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Farmer Union Vote Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALINAS, Calif. (AP) -- The United Farm Workers, struggling to  
regain the clout it had under Cesar Chavez, was dealt a tremendous 
setback when California strawberry pickers voted to join an upstart 
committee that has never negotiated a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the results are not official and the UFW can still  
force a runoff, the election this week was widely seen as another 
sign of the union's failure to recover from years of decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``The UFW made a lot of mistakes here,'' said John Borrego,  
associate professor of community studies at University of 
California, Santa Cruz, who follows the agricultural labor 
movement. ``This should send them the message that they have to 
change their strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,300 pickers working for Coastal Berry, the nation's  
largest strawberry grower, voted Tuesday and Wednesday, in favor of 
being represented by the Coastal Berry of California Farm Worker 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	State labor officials have yet to finalize the 646-577 vote.  
About 60 ballots are in dispute, and another 79 workers voted for a 
third option of no union, meaning that neither the UFW nor the 
novice committee has obtained the majority support necessary for 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW cannot win, said the state Agricultural Labor Relations  
Board, though it still could force a runoff if the Farm Worker 
Committee does not receive enough of the remaining votes. 
</P>
<P>
	UFW president Arturo Rodriguez said he was saddened by their  
loss to the upstart union. He blamed interference by antiunion 
growers who feared a victory at Coastal Berry might spread to other 
berry fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their organization has nothing to offer, while we have  
demonstrated and proven results,'' he said. ``Clearly there was 
intimidation and coercion here, and we're going to continue our 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results were considered pivotal in the UFW's effort to  
recover from the years of decline that came even before the 1993 
death of its legendary founder, Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Chavez, 80,000 farmworkers were working under UFW  
contracts by 1970. Union membership had dwindled to 20,000 at the 
time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the UFW tried to kindle a resurgence in the state's  
$600 million, 20,000 worker strawberry industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But outside observers said the UFW made mistakes, including  
replacing about 10 local organizers with out-of-town professionals, 
and underestimating the tight relationship pickers had with 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were tremendous accusations when the UFW started  
organizing here that they were acting like bullies and they were 
telling these fiercely independent people that they should turn to 
them for support and give them part of their paycheck,'' said 
Borrego. ``This generation of workers hasn't even heard of Cesar 
Chavez. They don't bring with them a history that unions are 
wonderful things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result came as no surprise to Jess Brown, executive director  
of the Santa Cruz County Farm Bureau. He said the worker's choice 
is a sign of the UFW's weakness in the community. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union wasn't able to clearly show that it could do more  
than what the workers presently have or could have,'' he said. 
``The UFW didn't do their research. They thought this was something 
they could easily attain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Harley Shaiken, an industrial relations professor at  
UC-Berkeley, said the close vote suggests the UFW remains a force 
to be reckoned with in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be easy to say they had the election, the UFW lost,  
end of story. But it's more interesting that under circumstances 
that have been very difficult, the union has come very close to 
victory at a pivotal company,'' Shaiken said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Berry Co. President Ernie Farley, who has repeatedly  
asserted his neutrality, said his company will ``abide by whatever 
representing body the state labor board certifies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Jim Gumberg, who represents the Coastal Berry of  
California Farm Worker Committee, said his group has no president 
and is led by a vice president -- Sergio Leal -- who was fired by 
Coastal Berry for alleged misconduct. He said he isn't sure whether 
they have obtained Labor Department recognition as a union, and he 
said none of them has negotiated a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Workers weren't voting for our agenda here,'' he said. ``They  
were voting against the UFW with its slick organizers who threaten, 
cajole, intimidate, and have never picked a berry in their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ALRB officials planned to meet Thursday to discuss the  
unresolved ballots, said the board's regional director, Fred 
Capuyan. He would not speculate on how long it would take to 
determine a winner.

<HEADLINE> Arts Can Help At-Risk Youngsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arts programs can help youngsters in danger of  
acting out their frustrations through violence, a Justice 
Department expert on young offenders told members of Congress 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids who are able to communicate with their peers and adults  
are much less likely to bottle up anger, which leads to the kind of 
incident we saw very recently in Georgia,'' said John J. Wilson, 
deputy administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice. ``There was 
a child who was unable to express his frustrations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was referring to 15-year-old T.J. Solomon, who faces 20  
counts of assault, cruelty and weapons offenses after shooting and 
wounding six youngsters at a suburban Atlanta school. He reportedly 
was troubled about a breakup with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson pointed to a pilot arts program in Fulton County, Ga.,  
called ``Art at Work'' that targeted truants aged 14 to 16 who had 
been referred to the program by probation officers. It included 
arts instruction and job and literacy training. It was financed by 
his office and the National Endowment of the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the program, he said, fewer than three out of 10  
of the truants could communicate effectively with one another, but 
after two years the figure had risen to more than eight out of 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson also pointed to a pilot arts program in San Antonio,  
Texas, where delinquent behavior dropped by 16 percent among 11- to 
13-year-olds. The rate in a control group that was not enrolled 
dropped by just 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Portland, Ore., a group of students 14 to 17 had already been  
before courts for juvenile crimes. Of those in who went into an 
arts program there was a 22 percent recidivism rate, compared to a 
47 percent rate among those not enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson made his presentation at the Congressional Arts Caucus,  
an informal group of lawmakers interested in promoting the arts in 
America. He discussed President Clinton's proposed $100 million 
budget for juvenile justice programs for fiscal 2000. The Justice 
Department has spent $93 million on 573 delinquency prevention 
programs over the past few years, Wilson said.

<HEADLINE> FBI, Senate Internet Sites Hacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer hackers continued a series of  
electronic attacks against some Internet sites for the federal 
government Thursday, defacing the Web page for the U.S. Senate 
before it was taken down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site for the FBI also remained inaccessible late  
Thursday, a day after the agency said hackers tried unsuccessfully 
to compromise it. It was unclear when the FBI site might be made 
available again. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an attempt (Wednesday) by unknown persons to  
unlawfully gain access to the FBI.Gov Web site,'' according to a 
statement Thursday from the agency. ``It was unsuccessful; however, 
as a precaution, the FBI shut down the site and is now taking 
additional steps to further insulate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An obscene message left briefly on the Senate's Web site  
Thursday blamed the attack on what it said was the FBI's harassment 
of specific hacker groups, including the group that took credit for 
breaking into the White House site earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who laughs last? ...,'' the message said, adding that the  
intent was to send a monition ``... to our friends at the FBI.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other federal Web sites, including those for the White House and  
the House of Representatives, appeared to be operating normally 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC reported that the attacks stemmed from the FBI's executing  
a search warrant on the home of a prominent hacker in Houston, 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Rolando Moss confirmed that agents were  
investigating allegations of computer intrusions involving the 
Houston hacker. The FBI executed four search warrants that remained 
sealed, Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, a grand jury in northern Virginia indicted  
Eric Burns, 19, on three counts of computer intrusion. Burns is 
reportedly known on the Internet as ``Zyklon'' and believed to be a 
member of the group that claimed responsibility for the attacks on 
the White House and the Senate sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors accused Burns of breaking into a computer  
between August 1998 and January 1999 in northern Virginia that is 
used by the U.S. Information Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zyklon'' was one of a dozen names listed on the hacked version  
of the White House Web site, which was altered overnight Sunday for 
a few minutes before government computers automatically detected 
the intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury also accused Burns of breaking into two other  
computers, one owned by LaserNet of Fairfax, Va., and the other by 
Issue Dynamics Inc. of Washington.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Joao Carlos de Oliveira, who held the

<HEADLINE> Moreno Driving in Indy, Motorola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Ill. (AP) -- Not long ago, Roberto Moreno thought he  
might be sitting out the biggest weekend of the year for open-wheel 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turns out, he'll be a heavy-duty driver, racing in the  
CART Motorola 300 on Saturday and IRL's Indy 500 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must say, it's going to be a busy weekend,'' Moreno said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old Brazilian driver believes he'll be enjoying the  
best of both worlds this weekend, even if it'll be a little hectic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any driver would love to race the Indy 500,'' Moreno said.  
``It's still one of the biggest races in the world, but so is the 
CART championship; series. It's one of those deals that I'm very 
honored and it's a great pleasure to do both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno is one of three drivers doing double duty this weekend.  
Like Moreno, Robby Gordon is also doing the Motorola 300 and the 
Indy 500. Tony Stewart has the toughest challenge, taking on Indy 
500 and the Coca-Cola 600 in Concord, N.C., on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst of the travel is on Thursday, when Moreno was at Indy  
for the traditional Carburetion Day in the morning, then drove in 
the afternoon practice session at Gateway International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow drivers don't seem to mind him doing double-duty for two  
different series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of what he's doing,'' Max Papis said. ``It shows a  
lot of will and it shows a love for the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't hurt that the war between CART and IRL, which first  
battled head-to-head on Memorial Day weekend in 1997, appears to be 
waning. Drivers would like Indy to return to its former exalted 
status. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to go back there if the situation was right and the  
equipment was right,'' said Richie Hearn, who was third at Indy in 
his only try in 1996. ``Who wouldn't want to go back there, really? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's lost some of its luster and notoriety, but that can  
change overnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if relations weren't thawing, Moreno would still be doing  
what he's about to do. He doesn't really care what anybody else 
thinks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of my focus is to block myself away from everything when  
I'm driving,'' he said. ``A driver doesn't have time to think about 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno didn't have a CART ride until Mark Blundell of the  
PacWest team cracked a verterbrae during testing at Gateway 
International Raceway in April. Just as in 1997, when he filled in 
while Christian Fittipaldi recovered from a broken leg, Moreno was 
happy to be the replacement driver for Blundell, who's expected 
back in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll be making his 50th career CART start, stretched over 14  
years, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno has been contracted for only three IRL races with  
Truscelli Team, including his second attempt at Indy, and has no 
guaranteed ride after this weekend. He has qualified in the 23rd 
position, putting him in the middle of the eighth row in the 33-car 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno believes his background as a consultant and test driver  
will help him get through the weekend. CART and IRL race vastly 
different machines, so his ability to change mental gears will be 
important. 
</P>
<P>
	``I switch like I switch a channel, and my mind is focused,''  
Moreno said. ``I can handle it very well because I can separate 
things.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Dan Aykroyd and his father, Peter, have joined  
the rush to mark the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the pair launched the ``Our Millennium'' project,  
which invites Canadians to give millennium gifts to their 
communities -- and give people something more than a good party to 
remember the dawn of the next 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have to look in your community where there's a  
need for something,'' said Dan Ackroyd, an Ontario native and a 
star of such films as ``Ghostbusters'' and ``The Blues Brothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Aykroyd family made the first donation with the gift of a  
Braille keyboard to a Kingston-area office of the Canadian National 
Institute for the Blind. The keyboard allows sightless people to 
translate the written word from the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aykroyds are promoting such ideas as shopping clubs for

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard Cuts 350 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co. will cut as many as  
350 jobs, or nearly 18 percent of its work force here, the company 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 workers will lose their jobs over the next three  
months. As many as 250 more jobs could be cut in the following 
months, the company said. Hewlett-Packard now employs about 2,000 
in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really tough news to deliver to our people,'' said  
Beth Quartarolo, a company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time, from a business standpoint, the decisions  
are clear,'' said Bob Weis, general manager of the Vancouver 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Although not all of the details have been worked out, Quartarolo  
said employees will be offered a voluntary severance package, but 
the company will lay off workers if its targets are not met. 
</P>
<P>
	The company shed 1,200 jobs from the Vancouver site last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard is sending more printer production to outside  
contractors, both in the Americas and overseas. By getting out of 
the manufacturing business, Weis said, the company has boosted its 
profits on inkjet printers. 
</P>
<P>
	What remains in Vancouver is the North American hub for  
designing and marketing inkjet printers for home and office use. 
Even as the layoffs are being announced, Weis said the company is 
hiring software and hardware engineers, programmers and top-level 
marketing people.

	Serbs Dismiss War Crimes Indictment  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A senior Yugoslav official today  
dismissed the indictment of President Slobodan Milosevic on war 
crimes as a political maneuver and said his government does not 
recognize the jurisdiction of the U.N. tribunal in the Netherlands. 
Indictments against Milosevic and four others on war crimes charges 
were announced today in The Hague by the tribunal's chief 
prosecutor, Louise Arbour. The indictments overshadowed continued 
heavy bombing in the 65th day of NATO's air campaign.

	Clinton Hails Milosevic Indictment  
</P>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- President Clinton applauded an international  
tribunal's war-crimes indictment today of Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic but said NATO's objectives are unchanged. ``It 
will reassure the victims of Belgrade's atrocities in Kosovo and it 
will deter future war crimes by establishing that those who give 
the orders will be held accountable,'' the president said in a 
statement issued by the vacation White House. ``The objectives of 
NATO's military effort remain unchanged.''

	Highway Fatalities Fell in 1998  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Highway fatalities fell again in 1998, with  
alcohol-related traffic deaths hitting an a record low last year, 
according to preliminary figures released by the government today. 
Overall, 41,480 people were killed on the nation's highways in 
1998, down from 42,103 in 1997. Alcohol was involved in 15,936 
traffic fatalities, or 38.4 percent of total highway deaths, as 
opposed to 16,189 fatalities, or 38.6 percent, the year before. It 
is the lowest level since the government began keeping records in 
1975.

neighborhood under construction in disputed east Jerusalem. The 
protesters, among them also Israeli peace activists and Arab 
Israeli lawmakers, rattled the fence ringing the plot owned by 
Irving Moskowitz, a Florida millionaire and benefactor of settler 
groups. A Jerusalem police spokesman said four people were detained 
on suspicion they attacked police officers and were later released.

homicide and drunken driving in the deaths of Sujan Tuladhar and

<HEADLINE> Parents of Shaken Baby Seek Custody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photo NY112    	
</P>
<P>
	MEDIA, Pa. (AP) -- A toddler whose father is accused of putting  
him in a coma will remain on a ventilator while a judge considers a 
government request to gain custody of the boy so he will be allowed 
to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirron Lewis, 20 months old, has been in a coma for more than a  
year. Authorities say his father, Ronald Lewis, shook his child so 
violently that it left Shirron blind, deaf and unable to swallow on 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis is charged with attempted murder and prosecutors say he  
will likely be charged with first-degree murder if the child dies. 
However, Delaware County officials want to have the child taken off 
of life support, contending that he suffers from such severe 
injuries that doctors do not expect him to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Joseph F. Battle has already denied a petition from  
county-appointed child advocate Barbara Scarlata that would have 
taken the boy off life support. The judge said the county must be 
granted custody first before Scarlata refiles her request. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Battle agreed to consider transferring custody  
from the parents, who oppose taking the child off of the 
ventilator, to the county. Social workers and medical experts 
testified about Shirron's extensive injuries during a closed 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirron, who was born premature, was rushed to a hospital in  
March 1998. Prosecutors said the baby was in the care of a 
babysitter but contend Lewis caused the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, 43, said he didn't cause the injuries and doesn't know  
how they happened, according to his defense lawyer, Wayne Punshon. 
Lewis, who attended Wednesday's hearing along with the child's 
mother, is in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis and Jackie Allen, 32, have said they believe only God can  
end a person's life and they do not want a court to decide what is 
best for their child. The couple, who are engaged and lived 
together at the time of the incident, also have an infant. 
</P>
<P>
	Another custody hearing is scheduled for June 18.

<HEADLINE> War Crimes Panel Indicts Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- In a historic announcement, an  
international tribunal said today it indicted Slobodan Milosevic 
and four powerful aides, calling the Yugoslav president personally 
responsible for planning and carrying out a gruesome campaign of 
war crimes in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time an international court has charged a  
sitting head of state with such crimes and atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. court's chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour, said arrest  
warrants have been issued for war crimes dating from the beginning 
of this year. If Milosevic can be brought to trial and is 
convicted, he would face a maximum life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, state media did not immediately carry the war crime  
tribunal's announcement but critics said it may have the effect of 
further empowering the Yugoslav leader in Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	An indictment of Milosevic had been widely expected with ethnic  
Albanians fleeing his brutal regime giving investigators detailed 
accounts of massacres, rapes and other atrocities since March, when 
waves of refugees -- thousands in columns -- were forced to flee the 
ethnic purge. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal said it has evidence of war crimes ``on a massive  
scale,'' and issued repeated calls to the NATO allies involved in 
the 2-month-old air campaign to gather as much evidence as possible 
against Milosevic and other authorities before the proof can be 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Milosevic, the others indicted were: Milan Milutinovic,  
president of Serbia; Nikola Sainovic, a Yugoslav deputy premier and 
a close aide of Milosevic; Vlajko Stojiljkovic, Serbia's interior 
minister; and Dragoljub Ojdanic, head of the Yugoslav army. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a credible basis to believe that these accused are  
criminally responsible for the deportation of 740,000 Kosovo 
Albanians and for the murder of 340 Kosovo Albanians'' from ages 2 
to 95, a somber Arbour told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely focused on bringing all the investigations we  
have to the highest level of responsibility,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a case that is not solely based on command  
responsibility. We have charged all five accused ... on the basis 
of personal criminal responsibility for ordering, planning, 
instigating, executing, for aiding and abetting in the commission 
of these offenses,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	The court has been under mounting pressure from human rights  
groups, politicians and others to indict top Yugoslav officials for 
their command responsibility in ordering atrocities against 
civilians in Kosovo or failing to prevent or punish subordinates 
for carrying them out. 
</P>
<P>
	But today's indictment threw renewed diplomatic efforts into  
question because Western envoys trying to mediate a peaceful 
settlement to the conflict must now face the awkward situation of 
negotiating with an indicted war crimes suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not approve of this initiative. It does not serve  
peace,'' France's interior minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, said 
today, criticizing the court for having a ``pseudo-moral vision 
instead of a political one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China said today it was ``concerned about the effect such an  
action may have on efforts to advance a political resolution for 
the Kosovo question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav officials called the indictment a political ploy to  
justify the NATO airstrikes that began March 24. The allied air 
campaign started 13 months after Milosevic's forces cracked down on 
ethnic Albanians, killing at least 2,000 people in Kosovo, a 
southern Serb province. 
</P>
<P>
	``This court for us does not exist,'' Branko Brankovic,  
Yugoslavia's chief envoy to the United Nations' European 
headquarters, said in Geneva. ``This so-called indictment is, I 
think, the last attempt by the NATO countries to avoid what is 
obviously inevitable -- and that's a total collapse of the policy of 
aggression by NATO.''	   The tribunal was expected to deliver the arrest warrants to the 
Yugoslav Embassy at The Hague. But that doesn't mean Milosevic will 
be arrested because Yugoslavia has refused to detain or hand over 
war crimes suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	Arbour called upon Yugoslav authorities ``to stand up for the  
rule of law and to request that the accused voluntarily submit to 
the jurisdiction of the tribunal or, if they fail to do so, to 
provide for their arrest and transfer to The Hague.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many officials indicted by the tribunal as war criminals in  
Bosnia have eluded arrest, including former Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, 
who have remained free since their 1995 indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal has been forced to rely largely on eyewitness  
accounts from refugees who have fled to neighboring Macedonia and 
Albania because Belgrade authorities repeatedly have refused to let 
Arbour or her deputies enter Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal has pressed hard in recent weeks to gather as much  
evidence as possible, fearing that Milosevic's forces may be 
destroying it to cover their tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgrade authorities repeatedly have refused to allow  
investigators to examine the sites of alleged massacres and 
interview witnesses. And NATO, preoccupied with its bombing 
campaign, has been slow to respond to the tribunal's calls for help 
in preparing an airtight case. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, tribunal spokesman Paul Risley said the court has  
compiled a file so large that ``the challenge is not to receive the 
information but to determine which areas to focus on, to zero in 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of Milosevic expressed concerns today that he will  
become even more powerful in Serbia as a result of the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now Milosevic is put into a corner and there's no incentive  
for him to make a compromise,'' said Vojin Dimitrijevic, director 
of the Belgrade Center for Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been speculation that a negotiated settlement to end  
the war could include a deal providing Milosevic with at least 
limited immunity from prosecution for war crimes.

<HEADLINE> Penguins: Arena Lease Is a Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins plan to argue Friday  
in bankruptcy court that an onerous lease blamed for the team's 
financial troubles is in large part a loan that is nearly paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, former Penguins star center and NHL Hall of Famer  
Mario Lemieux's plan to save the team from dissolution calls for 
paying leaseholder SMG $15 million to buy out the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	But, if the Penguins' prevail in their argument that most of the  
lease is really an almost-satisfied loan, the value of the lease 
would drop considerably, perhaps relieving Lemieux of having to 
make that payment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is huge,'' said Lemieux's attorney, Doug Campbell.  
</P>
<P>
	When Howard Baldwin bought the team in 1991, SMG provided $24  
million toward the purchase price. As a result, the team pays an 
estimated $6 million to $7 million per year to SMG, payments 
Penguins officials say helped drive the team into bankruptcy and 
are preventing a financial recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	While the deal was drawn up as a lease through 2012, it was  
actually a loan, Penguins' attorney Robert G. Sable said. He 
calculated that the unpaid balance is under $3 million, assuming a 
9 percent interest rate on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday Sable filed a motion asking U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  
Bernard Markovitz to terminate the lease. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to reject the lease because a plan won't work with  
this lease in place,'' Sable said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge scheduled an emergency hearing on the motion for  
Friday, the same time as the initial hearing on a rival takeover 
plan submitted by SMG and Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh and on the 
National Hockey League's proposal to dissolve or move the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG President Wes Westley dismissed the Penguins' motion as  
``another legal maneuver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Cribbs, the team's vice president of legal affairs, said  
rejecting the lease would put all of the takeover plans on even 
footing because all will require a new arena lease. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both the judge and the NHL have identified the lease as the  
key to the case and the key to saving the Penguins for 
Pittsburgh,'' Cribbs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Westley has disputed that the lease is responsible for the  
team's financial woes, citing rising player salaries and cash 
withdrawals by the team's co-owners as more important factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux on Tuesday submitted a revised plan, reducing the amount  
of money he claimed he was owed by the team by $5 million, to $27.5 
million. He said he would convert $20 million of that into equity 
in the team and forgive the remaining $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed raising $65 million in new capital from other  
investors, up from $50 million in his initial plan.

<HEADLINE> Discovery Departs For Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery blasted off  
for the new international space station today, ending a six-month 
launch drought for NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.5 million-pound ship, carrying seven astronauts and a full  
load of space station supplies, soared into a hazy sky at 6:49 a.m. 
as a brilliant yellow sun emerged above the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys have a great mission,'' the launch director told the  
crew just before liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The space station was soaring 235 miles over the Atlantic, due  
east of the Carolinas, when Discovery took off in pursuit. They're 
due to link up early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Because a space shuttle hadn't flown since December -- making  
this the longest gap between shuttle launches since the Challenger 
disaster -- NASA was especially vigilant during flight preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	The only major problem in the past month was hail, which  
pummeled Discovery's fuel tank and forced a one-week delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Its external fuel tank speckled with patches, Discovery holds  
more than 4,300 pounds of spare parts, tools, laptop computers and 
clothes for the station's first permanent residents, due to move in 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 10-day mission, Discovery's seven astronauts will not  
only haul supplies into the space station, they will also fix 
broken U.S. and Russian equipment and install mufflers to reduce 
the noise caused by clattering Russian fans. Two of them will also 
take a spacewalk to attach one crane and parts of another to the 
outside of the station. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first flight to the station since shuttle astronauts  
took up the second component in December and attached it to the 
first, which was already in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, commander Kent Rominger and his  
U.S.-Canadian-Russian crew will be the first to actually dock with 
the complex. Rominger, a Navy pilot, will pull up and dock the same 
way it was done during the shuttle-Mir program. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, an unmanned Russian rocket is scheduled to launch  
the next piece of the space station, a service module containing 
life-support systems. Then, NASA's space shuttle Atlantis is 
supposed to follow in December with more equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	However, everything is on hold until the Russian component --  
already more than 1 1/2 years behind -- is in orbit. And many question 
whether the Russians can finish building and testing it by 
November, given the country's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The repeated delays in the Russian service module caused the  
six-month gap in shuttle launches, as did ongoing problems with a 
NASA X-ray telescope that's supposed to be hoisted aboard the 
shuttle Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	To stay sharp, NASA's launch team conducted extra countdown  
practices during the hiatus and spent extra time reviewing 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	It paid off. Discovery's safe climb to orbit was a bright spot  
amid a number of recent failed launches of unmanned rockets. Three 
satellites ended up in useless orbits and another was vaporized 
shortly after launch, all since April. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, two satellites were destroyed in launch explosions  
last August. None of the six satellites belonged to NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery is due back June 6.

<HEADLINE> Progress Made in Eradicating Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Substantial progress has been made in eradicating  
polio worldwide, but federal health officials said today that much 
more work is needed in India and parts of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Health Organization's goal is to eradicate the  
crippling virus by 2000. But the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention said that will require a ``major acceleration'' of 
polio-fighting efforts in some places. 
</P>
<P>
	Polio cases reported in southeast Asia increased last year to  
4,673, up from 2,827 in 1997. The CDC said the rise is likely due 
to improved reporting and surveillance of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	In Africa, there were 992 cases reported last year, down from  
1,087 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	All 26 cases in the WHO's European region -- which includes  
former Soviet Asian republics and part of the Middle East -- were 
confined to Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease has been wiped out in the Western Hemisphere since  
1991. In WHO's western Pacific region, which stretches from French 
Polynesia to China, the virus has not been detected since March 
1997.

<HEADLINE> Movies May Be a Mouse Click Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Imagine a Blockbuster night without  
Blockbuster, a time when no video store will ever slap you with a 
late fee or fine you for failing to rewind. Because, in this world 
there are no videos, only home computers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's closer than you might imagine -- and closer than the video  
industry may want to admit. 
</P>
<P>
	With technology surging ahead and investors going gaga over any  
company with a ``dot.com'' to its name, interest is building in 
delivering rental movies over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	It's already technically possible for those with fast Internet  
connections. One company recently offered over the Internet the 
brainy sci-fi film ``Pi'' for $2.95 a pop, and its upcoming slate 
includes the Rosanna Arquette picture ``Fait Accompli'' and the 
B-movie anti-classic ``Toxic Avenger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet movies for the masses must still wait for a variety of  
technical, economic and regulatory problems to be sorted out. The 
best estimates see Internet movies booming in five to 10 years 
</P>
<P>
	But the prospect of having movies a mouse click away has already  
shaken up an entertainment industry that was late in recognizing 
the impact of music over the Internet. It has also moved society 
another step closer to a lifestyle bound up in the Internet and the 
home computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of change are everywhere, from the financial markets to  
studio boardrooms, even the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-profile lawsuit by Jeffrey Katzenberg against his  
former company, the Walt Disney Co., is now focusing on Hollywood's 
high-tech future, with his first expert witness last Tuesday 
predicting tens of millions of homes will have movies-on-demand in 
the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	This is important to Katzenberg because he believes his fat  
incentive bonus -- the subject of the litigation -- will grow even 
fatter by a cut from the money Disney can make off 
Internet-delivered movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, in Cannes, moviemakers were joined at this year's  
film festival by Web company executives on the prowl for product. 
One of them, Michael Metcalfe, recalled that when he went to the 
Cannes Film Festival last year ``no one would really listen to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, I came back and it was just overwhelming,'' said  
Metcalfe, head of Canadian-based Global Media Corp., which wants to 
deliver movies over the Internet. ``The response was just, 'Wow! 
When can we do this?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Cannes was Scott Sander, president of Sightsound.com,  
who went to the festival after signing what is believed to be the 
first licensing deal between a studio and an Internet company, 
acquiring the cyberspace rights to ``Pi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people in the industry were really blown away by  
this,'' said Sander, noting that research found a surprising 
percentage of those downloading ``Pi'' were entertainment business 
types checking out the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Sander believes demand for Internet movies initially will be  
fueled by college students, whose schools have broadband Internet 
connections that can download a feature-length movie in about 20 
minutes and show it on a Microsoft media player. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Internet company going into movies is Broadcast.com,  
which has bought a stake in Trimark Entertainment for about $4 
million in stock. That gave Broadcast.com the distribution rights 
to ``Warlock'' and dozens of other titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step will be high-speed hookups in the average American  
home. The exact timeline is still in dispute, but the process may 
have been sped up by recent technological breakthroughs in software 
compression, the now-routine digitizing of movies for the new DVD 
format, and megadeals like the one struck by AT&AMP;T to get into the 
cable business. 
</P>
<P>
	Predictably, those least bullish on Internet movies are video  
store owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the short time frame, I think it's only real value is  
publicity and gimmickry,'' said Mark Vrieling, owner of three Rain 
City Video stores in Seattle and chairman of the board of the Video 
Software Dealers Association. ``The pipes just aren't there to 
handle it. It's not even close. Until that infrastructure is built, 
it's just not realistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Vrieling has no illusions about Internet movies; he just  
thinks it will take longer than others expect. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the year 2010 and beyond, that may be a realistic way that  
movies are distributed, and it's got a potential for affecting us 
in a very large way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing going for the video industry is that it has confounded  
all previous predictions of its demise. It has survived everything 
from pay-per-view movies to the recent upheaval over rental 
revenue-sharing deals with the studios. 
</P>
<P>
	And it may survive Internet movies. One option is for video  
stores to join the Web wave. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing stops us from having a bunch of DVDs in the back room  
and sending them to people's houses on phone line,'' Vrieling said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Internet movies are not expected to affect theatrical  
movies -- in the same way video has not crimped the old-fashioned 
way of watching films -- the major studios are wary. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Katzenberg trial, for example, Disney is a lot less  
optimistic about its cyberfuture, and not just because it's trying 
to save shareholders a few hundred million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The studios fear Internet-delivered movies will only exacerbate  
the huge problem of movie piracy, which is already costing 
Hollywood millions in video sales at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	During the early media previews of the new ``Star Wars''  
prequel, audiences were urged to report anyone who may have been 
clandestinely videotaping the film. But despite 20th Century Fox's 
vigilance, pirated copies of ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom 
Menace'' are sure to surface following the theft earlier this week 
of a print from a theater in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Films like ``Armageddon,'' ``Godzilla,'' ``Payback'' and ``The  
Thin Red Line'' have all been found on Internet sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see the Internet as a great opportunity and a great  
resource for the film industry,'' said Richard Taylor, spokesman 
for the Motion Picture Association of America, the lobbying arm of 
the major movie studios. ``But we also recognize that if left 
unchecked, piracy on the Internet can cause a great deal of 
damage.''

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Antagonists Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOME, Togo (AP) -- Peace talks between Sierra Leone's warring  
sides reached their first major hurdle Thursday as rebels demanded 
immediate freedom for their imprisoned leader and government allies 
leveled accusations of cease-fire violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Omraie Golley, spokesman for the rebel Revolutionary United  
Front, said the release of Foday Sankoh is crucial to the success 
of the negotiations aimed at bringing peace to the war-ravaged West 
African nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't expect the man to negotiate with his jailers while  
he's shackled and chained,'' said Golley, speaking by cellular 
telephone from a soundproof negotiating room in a luxury hotel in 
Togo's capital of Lome. 
</P>
<P>
	Sankoh, who was imprisoned two years ago and sentenced to death  
for treason last October, is on temporary leave from prison during 
the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sierra Leone's President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who predicted the  
talks would bring peace by the middle of June, has said he would 
consider Sankoh's release in exchange for concessions from the 
rebels. Golley said he expected the government to address Sankoh's 
release by Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The peace talks are the latest in a series of efforts to end an  
eight-year war that has killed tens of thousands and left more than 
half a million homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Brig. Gen. John Onu, a commander of the West African  
intervention force known as ECOMOG that is helping the government 
fight the rebels, said Thursday that the rebels overran the 
northern town of Bonai, killing one ECOMOG soldier and wounding 
three others in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	He also threatened massive retaliation if the rebels attack  
ECOMOG bases near Freetown, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels denied the accusations.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a spokesman for the U.N. food agency, World Food  
Program, warned that civilians in the major interior towns of Bo 
and Kenema had received only two weeks of food rations since the 
beginning of April. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagdi Othman said the towns remained too dangerous for aid  
workers, despite assurances from the rebels and government that a 
cease-fire that began Monday would allow aid convoys safe access to 
all areas of the country.

<HEADLINE> 'Last Supper' Restored, on Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Italy proudly put a cleaner, brighter ``The  
Last Supper'' on show to the world Thursday, the result of a 
22-year scraping and scrubbing that brought light and color to 
Leonardo da Vinci's grease- and grime-blackened masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics condemned the restoration -- which took nearly two  
decades longer than Leonardo spent painting the fresco -- saying it 
removed traces of earlier retouchings they believe may have at 
least been faithful to the original. The latest restoration was at 
least the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Culture Minister Giovanna Melandri presided over a VIP-only  
showing late Thursday, part of events that included a Mass, 
full-page newspaper ads touting the project and previews for the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have brought to light are Leonardo's original and  
brilliant colors,'' declared Pinin Brambilla Barcilon, who spent 
half her professional life overseeing the work in the refectory of 
Santa Maria delle Grazie church in downtown Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has been removed from the original painting and  
nothing has been added,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	With scaffolding and curtains removed and floodlights focused on  
the fresco, Leonardo's work showed new life and colors Thursday -- a 
much more vibrant version of the previously almost blackened wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Restorers left blank some patches where the original paint was  
erased by time -- parts of Jesus' blue cloak and the figures of the 
apostles Matthew and Simon. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, they used high-tech science, special chemicals and  
microscopes to remove piled-on paint and varnish of earlier 
restorations, flake by flake, to reach Leonardo's original, the 
restoration coordinator Guiseppe Basile said. 
</P>
<P>
	In areas of the 15-foot-tall, 30-foot-long painting, 90 percent  
of the original survived, according to Pietro Marani of the Milan 
commission of artistic and historical heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, however, the painting is now ``18-20 percent Leonardo  
and 80 percent by the restorer,'' said James Beck, an art history 
professor at Colombia University in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	``They scraped everything away and repainted it themselves,''  
said Beck, a longtime critic of many of Italy's restoration 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	``She repainted the head of Christ, which I thought was pretty  
drastic,'' Beck said of Brambilla. ``People seem to like it, but 
that's not the issue. It's a post-modern painting now, and not a 
Renaissance painting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck argued that restorers should have left the earlier  
restorations -- historically significant in themselves -- intact and 
projected an image somewhere else in the refectory of what the 
fresco originally may have looked like. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck is president of ArtWatch International, a group that  
monitors restorations. 
</P>
<P>
	The restoration itself was unnecessary even ``in terms of  
conservation,'' contended London-based Michael Daley, director of 
ArtWatch UK. 
</P>
<P>
	Working on commission for Duke Ludovico Sforza from 1494-98,  
Leonardo rendered his interpretation of Christ's last meal with his 
apostles by painting on bumpy, dry plaster, using pigments mixed 
with egg and oil. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a tempera painting, rather than a true fresco painting on  
wet plaster. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1566, architect Giorgio Vasari noted that the painting was  
decaying and looked like nothing more than a ``blinding spot.'' 
Grease from adjoining kitchens already was seeping into the wall 
under the work. 
</P>
<P>
	History heaped further indignities on it. Workmen in the 17th  
century cut away Christ's legs and feet to widen a door. Napoleon's 
troops boarded their horses in the hall. In 1943, an Allied bomb 
hit the building, bringing down the roof and one wall, but the 
painting was spared. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine known previous restorations, often badly executed,  
added to the miseries of the masterpiece, as did humidity, dust and 
pollution, Marani said. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's successive governments have been closely associated with  
the latest restoration. 
</P>
<P>
	Melandri, the culture minister, called the refurbished work  
``the inheritance ... we want to leave to future generations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To guard the refurbished work, visitors will be directed through  
special filtering systems and dust-absorbing carpets before 
reaching the refectory. Reservations will be necessary for the 
15-minute visits.

<HEADLINE> Euro Hits New Low Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro dropped to a new low against the dollar  
Thursday, but recovered slightly after European central bankers 
expressed support for the struggling new currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0420, down  
from $1.0455 Wednesday. Earlier in Europe, it fell to $1.0409, down 
more than 10 percent from where the euro started in January when it 
replaced the currencies of 11 nations in the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro has stumbled in recent weeks amid concerns about the  
soundness of the European Union and slowing economic growth in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Those worries were exacerbated this week by an EU decision to  
allow Italy to increase its budget deficit. Many fear that other 
European nations will soon let their budget deficits increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jitters eased somewhat on Thursday after Bank of France  
governor Jean-Claude Trichet said that he expected ``a very big 
potential for appreciation'' in the euro in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to his remarks were bullish comments from Otmar Issing,  
chief economist of the European Central Bank, and Hans Tietmeyer, 
president of the Deutsche Bundesbank and governing council member 
of the European Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``The national central bank officials that form the EU are  
content that the decline in the euro is due to temporary factors 
and the euro will strengthen on a long-term basis,'' said David 
Gilmore, partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Thursday, the dollar fell to 120.38 yen from  
122.17 yen after a top Japanese official was quoted as saying that 
Japan's financial crisis had come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	In an article in the Asian Wall Street Journal, Japanese vice  
finance minister for international affairs Eisuke Sakakibara said 
Japan's financial ``crisis that started in November of 1997 ended 
in the first quarter of 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did, however, also say that there was uncertainty over when  
and how strongly the Japanese economy will recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the dollar also was quoted at 1.5238 Swiss  
francs, up from 1.5229; and 1.4751 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.4720. The British pound rose to $1.5990 from $1.5954. 
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries that have switched to the  
euro are no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a 
fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth:  
1.8769 German marks, up from 1.8706; 6.2933 French francs, up from 
6.2735; and 1,858.74 Italian lire, up from 1,851.85.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Vacation During Wartime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- It's vacation during wartime: Kosovo keeps  
intruding on President Clinton's fun in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	When he's not on the links, bicycling with the first lady or  
touring the wildlife preserve on White Oak Plantation, he's on the 
phone with world leaders or donning jacket and tie to speak to 
reporters about events in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's been plenty of down time.  
</P>
<P>
	``Having a good time?'' Clinton asked reporters as he ventured  
outside the edge of the plantation for the first time Thursday to 
address the U.N. Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's decision to indict 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone turned the question back on him. ``Oh yeah. We need  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a brief statement praising the tribunal's work, he climbed  
back into his bronze Chevrolet Suburban and rode back to the 
compound for a round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's day included phone calls to French President Jacques  
Chirac, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Czech President 
Vaclav Havel. He talked with Chirac and Blair about the NATO 
mission, but the call to Havel was more personal -- Clinton wanted 
to check on Havel's recovery after a hospital stay. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton has been  
playing with the golf pros who work at White Oak, mainly a group of 
25- to 30-year-olds the president described as ``excellent 
teachers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He said the round yesterday was one long lesson,'' Lockhart  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than golf, Clinton roamed the 7,500-acre preserve and saw  
zebras, rhinos and a baby giraffe. Lockhart said the president came 
away saying he saw more animals than he had last year on a safari 
in Botswana.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices fell sharply in morning  
trading Friday in line with a plunge on Wall Street. The dollar 
dropped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 207.21 points,  
or 1.28 percent, to finish the morning session at 15,969.98. On 
Thursday, the Nikkei index shed 53.33 points, or 0.33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.64 yen, down 1.79 yen from late Thursday  
in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 120.38 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors worried about a possible slowdown  
in the U.S. economy following Thursday's plunge in New York stock 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average sank 235.23  
points to 10,466.93, its worst single-session decline of the year 
and its lowest level since April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Another negative factor affecting the Tokyo market was a sharp  
decline in near-term June Nikkei futures prices on the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange, also Thursday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hideyuki Okoshi, deputy manager at Chuo Securities, said the  
Nikkei 225 was likely, however, to find support between 15,700 and 
15,900 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were lower almost across the board, with the fishery,  
precision and marine transportation sectors leading the decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also discouraged by a stronger yen against the  
dollar. A higher yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad 
and thus less competitive, cutting into earnings at export-led 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 12.53 points, or 0.96 percent, to 1,289.64 
points. The TOPIX closed down 1.15 points, or 0.09 percent, 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's relative strength in Tokyo  
from its New York levels came after institutional investors bought 
dollars on dips. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback tumbled to a low of 119.70 yen in New York -- the  
first time it broke through the 120-yen mark since May 3 -- as 
market players took cues from the selloff in the Dow Jones 
industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.82 yen, down  
from 127.58 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.5650 percent from 1.4950 percent late Thursday, driving its 
price down to 98.57 yen from 99.17 yen.

<HEADLINE> Judge Sets Aside Part of Gun Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge today approved a jury's decision  
to order gun makers to pay $500,000 to a shooting victim who won a 
landmark lawsuit against the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge Jack Weinstein dismissed the cases against gun makers  
brought by the other six plaintiffs because the jury -- despite 
finding liability -- failed to award any damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Like some lawsuits against Big Tobacco, this one accused the gun  
industry of negligently marketing a legal product. The case was 
closely watched by several cities trying to recover the costs of 
gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in 1995 by Steven Fox, 19, who was  
accidentally shot in the head by a friend who bought a gun on the 
street, and the relatives of six homicide victims. 
</P>
<P>
	After a monthlong trial, a jury in February found several gun  
manufacturers responsible, but the only damages they awarded were 
$500,000 from three gun makers to Fox and his mother.

<HEADLINE> Three Harness Drivers Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- Catello Manzi, who has driven more than  
8,000 winners in a 30-year career, was hospitalized with head and 
back injuries after being hurt in a spill Thursday at Freehold 
Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	Manzi, 48, was catapulted from his sulky and apparently kicked  
in the head by one of the three horses involved the spill during 
the first race, said track spokesman Bill Fidati. 
</P>
<P>
	Manzi lay on the track for about 25 minutes before being taken  
to Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, Fidati said, adding that 
the driver did not lose consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	A nursing supervisor at the hospital said that Manzi was in  
stable condition and that he would be held overnight for 
observation. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers John Sheehan and Jeff Gregory also were injured.  
</P>
<P>
	Gregory was treated for possible back and leg injuries at  
CentraState Medial Center in Freehold and released, said hospital 
spokeswoman Ronda Cluff. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan was treated for possible back injuries at Jersey Shore  
Medical Center and released, said hospital spokeswoman Joni 
Schultz. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened when Y F Illusion, driven by Sheehan, fell  
while racing on the lead, Fidati said. 
</P>
<P>
	Manzi was racing right behind the leader with Crown Can. He was  
ejected from his sulky after Crown Can plowed into Y F Illusion. 
Gregory and Justatrotter then hit the pile. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory and Sheehan were both thrown from their sulkies. Crown  
Can and Justatrotter stayed on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidati said one of the horses then kicked Manzi as he lay on the  
track. The Freehold resident was not able to get on his feet before 
he was removed from the track, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Manzi is the leading driver at the current Freehold meet with  
more than 100 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the horses was seriously injured.

<HEADLINE> Two Charged in Dragging Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTREE, S.C (AP) -- Two white men were jailed on charges they  
grabbed a black man by the arm and dragged him as they drove down 
the road in a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Charone Green, 23, suffered leg and arm injuries but was not  
seriously hurt, the Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Kelvin Washington asked the FBI and the state to  
investigate whether the crime was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no indication at this point that it is,'' he said.  
``There is a possibility that it may be drug-related.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric W. Jones, 38, and Arthur Marshall, 34, were charged with  
assault and battery with intent to kill. Marshall was also charged 
with possession of a stolen vehicle -- the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, a black man was chained to a pickup and dragged to  
death in Jasper, Texas. Three white men were charged with murder. 
One has been convicted and sentenced to death. The others are 
awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Carolina incident occurred in rural Bloomingvale,  
about 90 miles east of Columbia, an area of tobacco fields and farm 
buildings with rusted tin roofs. 
</P>
<P>
	Green told investigators he was standing at the end of a  
driveway early Wednesday when two men pulled up. He said the 
passenger grabbed his arm, and the truck drove off, dragging him a 
quarter-mile. Green told investigators he bit the man holding him 
and the man let go. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, who lives with his grandmother, could not be located for  
comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A cousin, Shirley Brunson, said that she saw the incident and  
that Green was released as the truck struck a culvert at the end of 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought they had killed the boy,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Green's grandmother, Mary Green, said: ``I can't say whether  
it's a racial thing or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a black church in nearby Greeleyville was burned down.  
Four former Ku Klux Klansmen were sent to prison for that crime and 
the burning of another black church in a neighboring county.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen's Parents Target of Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- An attorney for relatives of a student slain at  
Columbine High School plans to file a $250 million lawsuit against 
the parents of student gunmen Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Fieger, best known for representing Dr. Jack Kevorkian,  
said he will file the lawsuit on behalf of Isaiah Shoels' parents 
perhaps as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Justice demands a full accounting of everyone who  
significantly contributed to this massacre,'' Fieger said. 
``Klebold and Harris could not have developed and executed their 
violence without the negligence of the parents and possibly 
others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney representing Wayne and Katherine Harris, Eric's  
parents, did not return a telephone message seeking comment 
Wednesday. Lisa Simon, a spokeswoman for the law firm that 
represents Thomas and Susan Klebold, Dylan's parents, declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, scattered gunfire and bombs inside  
Columbine High School on April 20, killing a dozen classmates and a 
teacher and injuring 23 students before they committed suicide.

<HEADLINE> Tips To Avoid Stolen Baggage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Travel agents and airport police officers have several  
suggestions about how to keep from getting your bags stolen at an 
airport baggage claim area: 

</P>
<P>
	--''About the only way to ensure it's safe is being close to the  
exit portal and watching for it and taking it off the belt as soon 
as possible,'' said Chief Tom Shehan of the Dallas-Fort Worth 
Airport police. In 1998, his officers arrested a man who stole an 
estimated 500 bags from DFW baggage belts and sold the contents at 
a flea market. 
</P>
<P>
	--Keep your bags with you until you leave the airport.  
</P>
<P>
	--When using a telephone, do not leave computers, carry-on bags  
or wallets unattended -- even for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
	--In the event a bag is taken by mistake, it helps to have your  
name both on the outside and the inside, said the American Society 
of Travel Agents.

<HEADLINE> Drunken Driver Gets 15-30 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A carpenter who predicted he would get a light  
sentence because the two people he killed while driving drunk were 
from another country was sentenced today to 15 to 30 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas Kurch, 35, was convicted this month of vehicular  
homicide and drunken driving in the deaths of Sujan Tuladhar and 
Dr. Alok Chalise, both of Nepal. It was Kurch's fifth conviction 
for driving drunk. He reportedly told a jailhouse informant that 
nobody would care because the victims were foreign. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have been sentenced to 40 years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was no other option but to lock him up,'' Assistant  
Allegheny County District Attorney Dan Cuddy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurch said he wished he could undo the fatal accident, but added  
that he planned to appeal his sentence, 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be quite selfish of me to ask forgiveness. I am not  
here to do so,'' Kurch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurch wasn't supposed to be driving Dec. 7, 1996, but he drove  
away from a bar anyway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been banned from driving for 18 years when he lost  
control of his girlfriend's van and it crossed a divider, sailed 
through the air and slammed head-on into the car that Tuladhar and 
Chalise were in on State Route 65 near Pittsburgh, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurch argued with the police officer who tried to free him from  
the wreckage, according to authorities, and an empty vodka bottle 
was found nearby. He had a blood-alcohol level of 0.37 percent -- 
more than triple Pennsylvania's legal limit of 0.10 percent for 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
	The carpenter had his license suspended in 1983, when he refused  
a blood-alcohol test during an arrest, which led to his first 
conviction. He has been cited 13 times for driving without a 
license, three other times for drunken driving, once for speeding 
and once for running a red light. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be one of the worst driving records I have ever  
seen, and I have seen a lot of them,'' Allegheny County Judge 
Robert Colville said. 
</P>
<P>
	A jailhouse informant testified during trial that Kurch bragged  
that he could get a plea agreement because the victims were ``two 
'gooks' from another country, that their families weren't going to 
be there, that it was too far, nobody would care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The informant, a convicted burglar, also said that Kurch said no  
jury would believe his blood-alcohol level was so high. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuladhar, 24, was about to graduate from the University of  
Georgia. Chalise, 31, had come to Pittsburgh to visit friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the accident, Kurch has been diagnosed with testicular  
cancer, said his attorney, Patrick Thomassey.

<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Wolde Harris and Jorge Dely Valdes had a goal and  
an assist each to lead the Colorado Rapids to a 4-2 victory over 
the San Jose Clash on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The win marks the seventh consecutive victory for the Rapids,  
and moves them into second place in the Western Conference, one 
point behind Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Cerritos earned a goal for San Jose less than a minute  
into the game. But the Rapids came back with Harris converting a 
penalty kick at 20 minutes to even the score. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine minutes into the second half, Anders Limpar sent in a  
corner kick. Clash defender Jamie Clark headed the ball off the leg 
of teammate Wade Barrett to it into the net for an own goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapids midfielder Ross Paule scored four minutes later, and Dely  
Valdes provided Colorado's final goal in the 73rd minute with 
assists from Harris and Marcus Hahnemann. 
</P>
<P>
	Midfielder Eddie Lewis earned San Jose's second goal in the 63rd  
minute.

<HEADLINE> Philly Tries To Help Troubled Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The mayor is assembling a team of police,  
social workers, clergy and other mentors to work intensively with 
92 young people considered extremely likely to kill or be killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Youth Violence Reduction Project is modeled on a successful  
program in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	It is scheduled to begin in Philadelphia's crime-ridden  
Kensington and Port Richmond neighborhoods, and will expand if it 
works well. 
</P>
<P>
	The 92 people, including eight women and girls, were identified  
from criminal records and school violence reports. Ninety percent 
of the group had arrest records for attempted murder, armed robbery 
or drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The intervention team will steer the 92 youths to job training,  
counselors and social services and also warn them they will be 
dealt with harshly if they return to violence. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar program in Boston is credited with driving the number  
of murders down 77 percent, from 152 in 1990 to 35 in 1998. In a 
nearly 2 1/2-year period ending in January 1998, not one Boston 
teen-ager was shot to death.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A 10-year, $16 million program to make concern  
for the environment a fundamental focus of religious life in 
America has been announced by an umbrella group. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-term goal of the group, Leadership of National  
Religious Partnership for the Environment, is to ensure that 
religious leaders of the next generation make caring for God's 
creation a priority of the churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, chancellor of the Jewish Theological  
Seminary, said to reach the goal would ``require the fundamental 
transformation of human hearts and habits, the ultimate challenge 
for religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership's announcement followed discussions in  
Washington between religious, business, labor, science, government 
and environmental leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's religious affiliates, serving more than 100 million  
Americans, are the U.S. Catholic Conference, National Council of 
Churches of Christ, Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life 
and Evangelical Environmental Network. 
</P>
<P>
	While secular and nonsecular groups will work toward a common  
goal, leaders stress that the emphasis is rooted in Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Environmentalism started with Genesis, not Earth Day,'' said  
Paul Gorman, executive director of the partnership.

 *Noisy church draws neighbors' ire    	
</P>
<P>
	DELTA, Colo. (AP) -- Praise the Lord, but lower the volume,  
please. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Latin American Pentecostal Church faces two counts of  
causing unreasonable noise, a misdemeanor. The charges were filed 
by the city after neighbors complained of a din of shouting, 
electric guitars and amplified sermons. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, the congregation moved into space vacated by  
Catholics and conducts evening services on Wednesdays, Saturdays 
and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
	Meri McCartney, who lives next door, said the music was so loud  
that when she called police to complain, the officer on the line 
asked her to turn down her stereo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a rock band with amplifiers,'' she said. ``Actually, the  
band isn't too bad. They're just too loud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Livingston, who lives across the street, said, ``I can sit  
in my brick house with my double-paned windows closed and I can 
hear every word of the sermon on their P.A. system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Hillyard, a lawyer who represents the church, said it is  
trying to keep the noise down. However, she said, the form of 
worship is characteristic of the denomination, which claims 5,000 
members nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Katy Livingston: ``I think it is wonderful that they are  
going to church. More power to them. I just wish they would do it 
quieter.''

America's largest Protestant congregations, has named the Rev. Mac 
Brunson as its fourth pastor in 10 years.

	Brunson, 41, has been a pastor in High Point, N.C., and  
president of the Baptist association in North Carolina. He succeeds 
the Rev. O.S. Hawkins, who became president of the Southern

</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Mike Cummings is acting president of the Baptist  
association. Cummings, who had been first vice president, will

<P>
	ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) -- Ronald Hasley, a retired bishop in the  
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has resigned from the 
denomination's clergy roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation came a week after Hasley was stripped of his  
duties amid allegations of sexual misconduct, church officials 
said. Four women claimed Hasley engaged in improper sexual conduct 
while he was a bishop, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasley, a bishop from 1987 to 1998, signed an agreement in April  
indicating his behavior at the Rockford-based Northern Illinois 
Synod constituted sexual harassment, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasley had been a mentor for new bishops and provided other  
part-time pastoral services during his retirement. In the written 
statement, he is quoted as saying he is sorry and hopes that the 
disclosure ``will begin a healing process.''

least another decade, declaring himself in good health following a 
minor heart attack in 1990 and a mild stroke last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, his duties would be split between a chief  
executive, hired from the business world, and a public spokesman. 
The latter is to be chosen within three years and would work as 
Dobson's understudy on the radio.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Tickets On Sale Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Tickets go on sale in Australia Sunday  
for the 2000 Summer Games and organizers should know quickly if the 
Olympic bribery scandal has dampened public interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans will have 48 days to return order forms for 5 million of  
9.6 million tickets to be sold for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Full payments must accompany all orders.  
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Hollway, chief executive of the Sydney Organizing  
Committee for the Olympic Games, hinted this month that less than 
50 percent of the local tickets would be sold by the time the 
initial offer ends July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	But popular events such as the opening and closing ceremonies,  
swimming finals and some track, gymnastics and basketball sessions 
are expected to attract more demand that supply, with a random 
ballot used to decide who gets tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney organizers hope the ticket sales will help fill an almost  
$100 million budget hole blamed in part on the fallout from the 
corruption scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's successful bid for 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey released this week by Roy Morgan Research found that 66  
percent of Australians surveyed in March said they were interested 
in the games, down from 68 per cent in December 1998, when the Salt 
Lake City scandal broke. It was the lowest level of interest 
recorded by the survey in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	General interest in attending any event dropped 3 per cent, to  
41 per cent, in the same three-month period, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	One International Olympic Committee remains under investigation,  
and it happens to be an Australian -- Phil Coles, a SOCOG board 
member and key player in the city's winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
	And IOC panel meets in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Monday to  
consider the latest details in the case against Coles, who is 
accused of abusing his position and helping Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Applicants will be limited to four tickets for the ceremonies  
and six for other premium sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG will write to all applicants by early September, informing  
them whether they have been successful in getting the tickets they 
want. If not they will be given the chance to purchase others. 
</P>
<P>
	Games organizers have been buoyed by a better-than-expected  
response to international sales, and say they will offer more of 
the premium tickets overseas if they are not taken up by 
Australians. 
</P>
<P>
	``For most sessions, people will simply order tickets through  
official Olympic Games ticket books and automatically get their 
seats because we have so many tickets,'' SOCOG ticketing 
communications manager John O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the ticket plan ``a very fair system'' but warned that  
leftovers ``won't necessarily just be on offer to the Australian 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG has not detailed what methods will be used to sell the  
remaining tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices range from $12.35 at sports such as rowing and baseball  
to $900 for the best seats at the opening and closing ceremonies. 
Seventy percent of all tickets will cost less than $39 and SOCOG 
aims to make $390 million from sales.

<HEADLINE> Deal Made by Norwegian Oil Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The Norwegian state oil company Statoil on  
Thursday agreed to step aside so Norsk Hydro ASA could continue a 
takeover bid for Norway's third oil company, Saga Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, Statoil, which owns about 20 percent of Saga, will  
accept access to parts of Saga's petroleum reserves on the 
Norwegian continental shelf in exchange for its shares. Statoil 
also will buy an additional 5 percent of Saga's assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would avert a bidding war between Statoil and Norsk  
Hydro, which is 51 percent state-owned, over the smaller, 
economically troubled Saga. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 10, Norsk Hydro announced a 17 billion kroner ($2.18  
billion) bid for Saga, offering one of its own shares for every 
three Saga shares on the condition that 90 percent of the smaller 
company's shareholders accepted the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	With its 20 percent interest, Statoil had been in a position to  
block the takeover. Norsk Hydro, with interests in petroleum, light 
metals and fertilizers, has set a deadline of the end of June for 
shareholders to accept its bid. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Saga reported that its operating profit dropped to  
378 million kroner ($48.5 million) in the first four months of the 
year from 618 million kroner ($79.2 million) million during the 
same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Saga said it had a net loss of 179 million kroner ($22.3  
million) for the first four months of 1999, compared with a profit 
of 280 million kroner ($35.9 million) a year earlier, mainly 
because of higher production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro, the largest company listed on the Oslo Stock  
Exchange, employs about 40,000 people worldwide. Saga has a staff 
of about 4,000. The larger company said it expected to cut about 
800 jobs if the takeover goes through.

<HEADLINE>  Lawmakers Hear Diverse Gun Views </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two parents whose children were slain by  
classmates gave lawmakers diverse views Thursday on whether the 
slayers, guns or lawmakers themselves are to blame for their 
tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Scott of Littleton, Colo., told the House Judiciary  
Committee's subcommittee that he blames the April 20 death of his 
daughter, Rachel Joy Scott, 17, on Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people behind those instruments of death,'' Scott  
told the panel. ``I do believe Eric and Dylan bear primary 
responsibility for my daughter's death, not the guns themselves.'' 
.
</P>
<P>
	But Byrl Phillips-Taylor of Richmond, Va., placed the blamed an  
AK47 for her son's 1989 death at the hands of a ``classmate with a 
grudge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The easy availability of guns got my baby killed,''  
Phillips-Taylor told the panel, urging lawmakers to pass the 
mandatory background checks for gun show transactions and other new 
firearms restrictions voted by the Senate last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate has demonstrated that it cares about keeping guns  
away from children,'' she said. ``And that may be the turning point 
that every mother like me has been waiting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders this week said they support the concept  
of the gun restrictions passed by the Senate, but they rejected 
demands from Democrats to quickly rubber-stamp the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, who has co-authored gun  
control bills in the past, said careful consideration of the 
legislation next month would ensure that new controls would not 
infringe on the Second Amendment right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans at Thursday's hearing criticized the Clinton  
administration as failing to prosecute violators of existing 
firearms laws while pushing for more gun restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., suggested that if the Ten Commandments had  
been posted at high schools where the shooting occurred, ``we would 
not have had the tragedies that bring us here today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Replied Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr.: ``If the young  
people and adult criminals who committed these crimes had a tougher 
time getting their hands on guns, these horrible crimes might have 
been prevented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, who broke a 50-50 Senate tie last week  
in favor of the new gun show restrictions, returned to the Capitol 
Thursday to accuse House Republicans of trying to please the 
National Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this very moment, there are some of the other side meeting  
behind closed doors plotting to have more delays in order to 
preserve loopholes'' in firearms law, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre told the House  
subcommittee Thursday that the Senate bill was a ``red tape 
nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically it would extend the reaches of the federal  
government into the homes of this country,'' LaPierre said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the NRA supports mandatory gun show background checks  
and other concepts in the Senate bill, but not as written. For 
example, he said, the Senate would ``your uncle's skeet-shooting 
range'' as a gun show subject to government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, testifying at the request of committee Republicans,  
supported LaPierre's complaint that some gun control advocates were 
seeking to put the blame for the shootings at the NRA's doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that they are responsible for my daughter's  
death,'' said Scott, who said he was not a member of the group and 
does not own a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott also scolded lawmakers about their eagerness to pass more  
laws despite the cultural causes behind school shootings. 
``Political posturing and restrictive legislation are not the 
answers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Names Foreign Aid Plan Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- President Clinton announced Thursday that he  
would nominate J. Brady Anderson to head the U.S. Agency for 
International Development, which manages foreign aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, a lawyer from Charleston, S.C., was U.S. ambassador to  
Tanzania from 1994 to 1997. He succeeds J. Brian Atwood, who held 
the post for the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to joining the diplomatic corps, Anderson lived in Kenya,  
Ethiopia and Tanzania researching African languages. He speaks 
Swahili. 
</P>
<P>
	A Vietnam veteran, Anderson worked as an Arkansas assistant  
attorney general, an adviser to then Governor Clinton and a senior 
law clerk to a federal judge in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Atwood withdrew his nomination to become ambassador  
to Brazil, saying opposition by Sen. Jesse Helms ruled out the 
possibility of Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood said Helms, R-N.C., who chairs the Senate Foreign  
Relations Committee, opposed the nomination because of his 
successful campaign to defeat the senator's proposal to merge USAID 
into the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	When he leaves his USAID post, Atwood will remain in charge of  
coordinating the president's humanitarian relief program for 
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Four Guards Charged in Inmate Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Four prison guards have been charged in  
the beating death of an inmate who allegedly angered them by 
repeatedly crying out for his methadone treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The guards pleaded innocent Wednesday in the death of Thomas  
Pizzuto, who died six days after entering the Nassau County jail to 
serve three months for a traffic violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizzuto, 38, a recovering heroin addict, had a seizure three  
days after the alleged beating and died. 
</P>
<P>
	All four guards were released on $500,000 bond. Lawyers for the  
men said they would be cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivano Bavaro, along with fellow jail guards Edward Velazquez and  
Patrick Regnier, were charged with two counts of federal civil 
rights violations. The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the indictment, Bavaro served as lookout when  
Velazquez and Regnier went to the inmate's cell and beat him 
repeatedly on Pizzuto's second day in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	After the alleged Jan. 8 beating, Pizzuto was left in his jail  
cell over the weekend to let his injuries heal, his family claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth guard, Joseph Bergen, was charged as an accessory after  
the fact for allegedly doctoring a report of the death to claim 
Pizzuto suffered his injuries in a shower room fall. The maximum 
sentence is 15 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	All four officers remain on modified duty at the jail pending  
trial. Their weapons were taken away, and they are permitted no 
contact with inmates.

<HEADLINE> White Sands' Horses Leave for S.D. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) -- With the thunder of  
hooves, among the last of the White Sands wild horses clamored into 
aluminum trailers today, bound for South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip ends a saga of a herd once numbering 1,800 horses that  
had roamed free long before the ranchland became an Army weapons 
range in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really happy to do this so the horses have a home,'' said  
rancher Alan Amiotte, who is taking the horses to his ranch of 
10,000 acres outside Rapid City. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since 122 horses died during a drought five years ago in  
southern New Mexico, the military and an animal protection group 
have been trying to find the horses new homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Adoptions whittled the population down to about 80 horses this  
spring. Last month, 35 horses were taken to Amiotte's ranch and on 
Thursday, 26 studs, seven mares and two foals were carted off. Some 
were so skinny their ribs could be counted. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 10 horses remain on the 3,000-square-mile desert  
range. If any mares are found -- there are believed to be three or 
less -- they too will be sent to South Dakota, which is 21 hours 
away by truck. Any studs will live out their lives at White Sands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a happy ending for these horses,'' said Karen Sussman,  
whose Scottsdale, Ariz.-based International Society for the 
Protection of Mustangs and Burros helped with the move. 
</P>
<P>
	The animals are among an estimated 20,000 wild horses roaming  
free in Nevada, California, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, 
Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico, Sussman said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the South Dakota ranch, the horses will retain their freedom  
in ranchland with knee-high green grass, rolling hills, towering 
pine trees and an abundance of fresh water. 
</P>
<P>
	``These horses are going to heaven, and I mean heaven,'' Sussman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although fear for their survival was what prompted the rescue  
effort, there was another reason for hastening their departure. 
</P>
<P>
	Because water is scarce in the desert conditions, the horses  
would tear up the banks of the few watering holes, dumping sediment 
into the water and potentially harming the White Sands pupfish, a 
species on the state's endangered list, said Patrick Morrow, a 
White Sands wildlife biologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The environment doesn't have the ability to support the  
animals,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	White Sands Missile Range officials were relieved, if a little  
heavy-hearted, over the horses' departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that we came up with a solution and the horses have  
found a place to go that will keep them together,'' spokesman Larry 
Furrow said. ``But as most people on the range, I'm a little sad to 
see them go.''

<HEADLINE> Shareholders OK Exxon, Mobil Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Only regulatory approval now stands between Exxon  
and Mobil and their history-making $82.2 billion merger, but 
analysts said consumers shouldn't worry about a possible increase 
at the gas pumps if that occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company ``can't exert undue influence on the retail  
market because most of the major oil companies don't own their own 
retail stations -- they're owned by individuals,'' said Keith 
Petersen of Salomon Smith Barney in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact on consumers will be hardly noticeable,'' agreed  
Michael L. Mayer of Schroder &AMP; Co. ``Gasoline marketing in the U.S. 
is highly competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate meetings Thursday, shareholders of each company  
overwhelmingly approved the marriage, which would produce one of 
the world's largest companies with about $150 billion in combined 
1998 revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would be called Exxon Mobil Corp. and have  
headquarters in Irving, Exxon's current home. Mobil is based in 
Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon's chairman Lee R. Raymond said the combined company will  
be more cost-efficient -- cutting costs by $2.8 billion -- and better 
able to compete with international competitors, including state-run 
oil companies, than would either Exxon or Mobil alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond, who would become chairman of the new company,  
acknowledged that federal regulators could force the sale of some 
gas stations where the two brands compete head to head. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said both nameplates -- the Exxon tiger and Mobil's red  
Pegasus -- would be retained. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators in the United States and Europe must still approve  
the deal, which company officials said they expect by October. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent analysts generally view the merger as benign for  
consumers, even though it would create the world's largest energy 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would expect that the regulators would look at this closely  
... I haven't seen anything yet that would cause a reason for 
concern,'' said Bill Noble, an AAA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the American Petroleum Institute, the new company  
would account for 12 percent of U.S. refining capacity and 7 
percent worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies predicted that the merger will result in the loss  
of 9,000 jobs -- 7 percent of their combined worldwide work force -- 
but admitted that's just an estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even without mergers, there would be layoffs in this  
business,'' said Mobil chairman Lucio Noto, who would become vice 
chairman of the combined company. ``Costs have to come down, people 
have to get more efficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders agreed. More than 99 percent of the shares in Exxon  
were voted in favor of the marriage, as were more than 98 percent 
of Mobil shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon Mobil will have about 48,500 gas stations around the  
world, with roughly a third in the United States, plus exploration 
and production operations worldwide. On a daily basis, the 
companies together produce 2.5 million barrels of oil and 
equivalent amounts of natural gas -- more than the country of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies announced plans to merge in December. Exxon is  
the biggest U.S. oil company and Mobil is No. 2. The merger will 
create the sixth-largest oil producer in the world and the largest 
that is privately owned. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination is part of a consolidation trend in the oil  
industry, which most observers expect will continue. BP-Amoco, 
itself the creation of a 1998 merger between British Petroleum and 
Amoco Corp., has agreed to buy Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron and Texaco are also discussing a merger, though the Wall  
Street Journal reported Thursday that negotiations between the two 
companies are bogging down over a number of issues, including 
control of the combined company.

	Infinity Buying Outdoor Systems  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Infinity Broadcasting, the radio arm of CBS, is  
buying the nation's largest outdoor advertising company Outdoor 
Systems for $6.5 billion in stock, the companies announced today. 
The deal, which had been rumored for more than a week, makes 
Infinity the largest outdoor advertising company in the United 
States and gives CBS a wider array of options to offer advertisers. 
CBS has been moving toward selling packages of advertising across 
its media outlets, which include network TV, radio and Internet 
sites. Outdoor Systems has some 110,000 outdoor advertising spaces 
such as billboards in major markets throughout the United States, 
Canada and Mexico. Infinity is also assuming $1.8 billion in debt 
in the deal. Infinity shares were down 1 3/16 at 24 13/16, and 
Outdoor Systems was down 9/16 at 28 1/4.

	Exxon, Mobil To Vote on Merger  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Shareholders of Exxon and Mobil are voting today  
on a proposal to merge the oil giants in a $82.2 billion deal that 
would create the world's biggest company. Analysts expect 
shareholders to approve the deal. The deal is expected to lead to 
the loss of about 9,000 jobs -- 7 percent of the companies' 
worldwide work force. The combined company would be called Exxon 
Mobil Corp. and have headquarters in Irving, Exxon's current home. 
Mobil is based in Fairfax, Va. The merger is still awaiting 
approval from U.S. and European antitrust regulators, which the 
companies expect could be completed by the fall. Exxon stock was 
down 1 11/16 this morning at 80 1/4, and Mobil was down 2 at 101 1/16.

	GDP Grows at 4.1 Pct. Annual Rate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, powered by the biggest boom  
in consumer spending in more than a decade, grew at a robust annual 
rate of 4.1 percent in the first three months of the year, the 
government said today. The Commerce Department said the increase in 
the gross domestic product occurred despite the fact that America's 
trade deficit from January through March was even worse than 
originally believed. The government said that corporate profits 
showed a big rebound in the first three months of this year,

<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- A Dutch court ruled today in favor  
of Italian fashion house Gucci and against the French company LVMH 
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton which is waging a hostile takeover 
battle for Gucci. The Amsterdam District Court rejected a demand by 
LVMH that Gucci's strategic alliance with French retailer 
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute be annulled. It also rejected LVMH's call 
for an investigation into Gucci's management. LVMH made an offer 
for Gucci in March but asked the court in a lawsuit filed in April 
to overturn measures taken by Gucci to avoid the bid, including 
issuing new shares to PPR.

	Mitsubishi Posts Modest Profit  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Mitsubishi Motors Corp. posted a modest profit last  
year in contrast to a loss a year earlier, as cost cutting and a 
gain on the sale of a manufacturing facility contributed to the 
turnaround. The company earned 5.67 billion yen, or $46 million, 
for the fiscal year ended March 31 versus a loss of 101.85 billion 
in fiscal 1997. Sales fell 6 percent to 3.51 trillion yen, or 
$28.67 billion, from 3.74 trillion yen a year ago. Mitsubishi 
expects profit to fall to 2 billion yen on sales of 3.52 trillion 
yen this fiscal year which ends in March 2000. Exports are expected 
to drop because of falling shipments to Latin America and the 
Middle East, the company said.

will acquire between 125,000 to 200,000 consumer, business and 
campus subscribers, according to today's Wall Street Journal. The 
final price of the deal will depend on how many of those 
subscribers stay with Prodigy. Prodigy's current membership is 
736,000. The acquisition from Cable &AMP; Wireless only covers 
subscribers using standard modems and phone lines to connect to the 
Internet, not high-speed lines. Prodigy shares were up 1 1/2 at 24 1/2, 
and Cable and Wireless was down 1 5/16 at 36 13/16.

<HEADLINE> Test Scores May Be Political Pawn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House hearing today on states' excluding  
special-education students from a national reading test turned into 
a debate on whether the administration improperly used the results 
to promote its education policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not let politics influence our ability to measure  
student achievement,'' said GOP Rep. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, 
chairman of the House Education and the Workforce's investigations 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic colleague, Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., suggested  
Hoekstra was pursuing his own political target: Vice President Al 
Gore, who first released the national test scores in February and 
highlighted gains posted under President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	An Education Department review of 1998 scores found states might  
have fared better on the congressionally mandated tests of 
fourth-graders because more disabled students than in previous 
years did not take the test. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen states excluded higher numbers of  
special-needs students last year than before, note critics of the 
test, known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's outgoing chief statistician, Pascal D. Forgione  
Jr., told lawmakers ``it would never be possible to know precisely 
the impact of exclusion rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend including more special-needs students, who could  
have scored poorly, probably would have lowered the states' scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Forgione, who oversaw the department's review, which was  
released earlier this month, offered research to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
	Department researchers used a model analysis of how excluded  
students might have scored. Only two states with large jumps in 
reading scores, Maryland and Kentucky, would not have shown 
improved results from earlier years had more special-education 
students taken the national test in 1998, Forgione reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The department will not use the findings to adjust state scores  
or rankings, Forgione said. But future studies will examine the 
severity of the excluded students' disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the sea of statistics, the hearing shifted more to partisan  
politics than education policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate focused on two events: the February announcement of  
national test results by Gore at an Education Department news 
conference also attended by several groups supportive of the 
administration's education proposals, and the release of state 
scores in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore emphasized increases in scores from 1994 from 1998, rather  
than their lack of change from 1992, and mentioned more than a 
dozen Clinton education programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoekstra angered Democratic members of the subcommittee when he  
suggested the Gore news conference violated the test-givers' policy 
of nonpartisanship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would not be here today if the Vice President wasn't  
running for president,'' responded Roemer. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats pointed out that in 1992, then-President Bush upset  
test-givers by mentioning unreleased data and criticizing the 
results at a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress, which created the board of test-givers in 1988, also  
urged that the test's administration and release of results be 
``buffered from any manipulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said in a recent letter to  
Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., the committee chairman, that ``concerns 
about the release of the data are unwarranted.''

	Arresting Milosevic Is the Hard Part  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After indicting President Slobodan Milosevic  
today, the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal still needs someone to 
arrest him, no small task. The tribunal indicted Milosevic and four 
other top officials on charges of crimes against humanity in the 
brutal expulsion of 750,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. The 
tribunal has no police powers, meaning it is entirely dependent on 
the international community to arrest indicted war criminals. Both 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British Foreign Secretary 
Robin Cook were asked about the possibility of Milosevic's 
apprehension, but neither offered hope.

suspected of spying for China. ``I was not briefed on the 
details,'' Reno said. National Security Adviser Samuel Berger also 
defended himself against accusations he wasn't aggressive enough

lapses at a weapons laboratory. ``I did take it seriously. I did 
act,'' Berger said on PBS' ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.''

<HEADLINE> AMA Restores Journal Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The American Medical Association is taking steps  
to avoid the kind of public relations problem that surfaced earlier 
this year when its executive vice president fired the longtime 
editor of its weekly journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA said Wednesday it will guarantee the editorial  
independence of the journal by creating a board to serve as a 
buffer between the editor in chief and the organization's 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	The move follows criticism that erupted in January, when Dr.  
George Lundberg was fired as editor of The Journal of the American 
Medical Association for publishing a survey of college students' 
sexual attitudes that coincided with President Clinton's 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson, the AMA executive vice president,  
said at the time that Lundberg had inappropriately interjected the 
organization into a political debate. 
</P>
<P>
	AMA officials did their best not to mention the episode  
Wednesday, dodging questions about Lundberg's firing by saying they 
preferred to look to the future than dwell on the past. 
</P>
<P>
	They instead announced new guidelines to assure JAMA's  
independence and praised the spirit of solidarity among board 
members, Anderson and the search committee that drew up the 
guidelines and is looking for a new editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Roger Rosenberg, chairman of the search committee, called  
the safeguards ``the issue we felt was most important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Editorial independence is essential,'' Rosenberg said.  
</P>
<P>
	Anderson will not have solo firing authority under the new  
guidelines. A firing would have to be approved by the newly created 
oversight board and two-thirds of the AMA's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	The oversight board will be composed of six members from outside  
the AMA, and one member of the association's senior management. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerome Kassirer, editor of the New England Journal of  
Medicine, had criticized Lundberg's firing as irrational and inept. 
He said the oversight board is a good idea, if it truly serves as a 
buffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key question will be: Are they going to be advocates for  
the editor in chief or advocates for the AMA policies?'' Kassirer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg, who had been JAMA editor for 17 years, is now editor  
in chief for an online medical information site, medscape.com. He 
did not return a phone call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Infinity Buying Outdoor Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Infinity Broadcasting, the radio arm of CBS, is  
buying the nation's largest outdoor advertising company Outdoor 
Systems for $6.5 billion in stock, the companies announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which had been rumored for more than a week, makes  
Infinity the largest outdoor advertising company in the United 
States and gives CBS a wider array of options to offer advertisers. 
CBS has been moving toward selling packages of advertising across 
its media outlets, which include network TV, radio and Internet 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Infinity is also assuming $1.8 billion in debt in the deal.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest acquisition for Mel Karmazin, who is chairman  
of both CBS and Infinity Broadcasting, which he headed before it 
was bought by CBS three years ago. Infinity is the second-largest 
radio company in the nation in terms of revenue, behind Chancellor 
Media. Infinity also has outdoor advertising operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Karmazin said in a statement that the purchase of Outdoor  
Systems ``extends our reach and establishes Infinity as the 
undisputed leader in the outdoor advertising business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outdoor Systems has some 110,000 outdoor advertising spaces such  
as billboards in major markets throughout the United States, Canada 
and Mexico. The company, which is based in Phoenix, also has a huge 
presence in New York, where it has 125,000 advertising displays in 
subways. 
</P>
<P>
	In early April, CBS bought King World Productions, the leading  
syndicator of television programming, for $2.5 billion in stock. 
King World distributes several hit shows including ``The Oprah 
Winfrey Show,'' ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Karmazin, CBS has also made more aggressive moves into the  
Internet business, exchanging promotion time on its advertising 
outlets for large equity stakes in startup companies. So far the 
strategy has paid off handsomely thanks to the successful IPOs of 
Internet darlings like MarketWatch.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal calls for exchanging 1.25 shares of Infinity stock for  
each share of Outdoor Systems, which values the transaction at $6.5 
billion, or $32.50 per share of Outdoor Systems, based on 
Infinity's closing share price of $26 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading today, shares of Infinity fell 62 1/2 cents to  
$25.37 1/2, while Outdoor Systems shares rose $1 to $29.81 1/4. Both 
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> GOP Celebrates Welfare Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Bill Archer, a top House Republican,  
still remembers being called names when he pushed the 1996 welfare 
overhaul, so he's feeling more than a little vindicated by the good 
news so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where are the children starving on the sewer grates?'' he  
asked Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Releasing a report on welfare reform, GOP leaders celebrated the  
diminishing welfare rolls and rising work rates, dismissing 
anything negative. Any problems are like ``cracks'' in the Sistine 
Chapel's ceiling, said Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., a lead author of the welfare bill, said  
the new report proves the overhaul was ``undoubtedly the most 
successful piece of legislation in this half century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, by the General Accounting Office, reviews a handful  
of the state studies on people who have left welfare and finds most 
people are working. But those same studies suggest former welfare 
recipients have not escaped poverty and are struggling to get by. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer and Shaw dismissed questions about those findings. They  
rejected warnings that things may get tougher when the economy 
worsens or when people use up their five-year lifetime limit on 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Skepticism comes from the same people who opposed welfare reform  
in the first place, said a defiant Archer. He seemed to welcome the 
chance to swing back at them, saying he feels vindicated by welfare 
rolls that are at a 30-year low and little evidence of severe 
hardships predicted by advocates for the poor and some Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``They called me a Nazi. They called me Hitler. They called me  
mean-spirited and said I wanted children starving on the sewer 
grates,'' he said. ``We had a job to do and we plowed through all 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can pick at anything,'' he added. ``Are we better off now  
that we were before? That's the question that's got to be asked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others -- even those who supported the reforms -- say it's too  
early to declare success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't won yet,'' said Rep. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md, who  
voted for the welfare bill. He said declaring victory is ``either 
naive or political'' given that many questions remain. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I really regret is they give the public the impression  
the job's been done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Segal, who heads the cheerleading Welfare to Work  
Partnership, agrees that there is more work to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't kid ourselves,'' he said. ``Many people, at best, are  
going from welfare to the working poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., who chairs the Ways and Means  
welfare subcommittee, said she would continue to work on the issue. 
But she also dismissed critics who say people leaving the rolls are 
having trouble making it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very hard to live on welfare,'' she said. And most people  
leaving the rolls, even if they take minimum wage jobs, make more 
than they got on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert joined the celebratory news  
conference, though he was less gleeful. He said he was encouraged 
by Vice President Al Gore's suggestion that faith-based groups can 
be more involved in social programs. And he suggested that more 
work remains.

<HEADLINE> GM Recalls Some Cadillac Sevilles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. is recalling about thousands  
of Cadillac Sevilles because electrical shorts in the generator may 
cause fires to start under the hood. 
</P>
<P>
	The danger is in 35,000 cars from model year 1999 and about 139  
from 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Fires have started even with the engine off and the key removed,  
GM said today. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been seven confirmed reports of fires, none of which  
have resulted in injuries, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want our customers to know that we consider this a serious  
condition,'' said John Smith, Cadillac general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall covers the 1998 vehicles built in August 1998, and  
have vehicle identification numbers greater than WU934376. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicles should not be parked in an enclosed area, like a  
garage, until they are brought into a dealership, GM said.

<HEADLINE> NY Baby Given to Genetic Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A black baby born to a white couple because of a  
mix-up during embryo implantation at a fertility clinic has been 
handed over to his genetic parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby, born Dec. 29 to Donna and Richard Fasano of New York,  
was given to Deborah Perry-Rogers and Robert Rogers of Teaneck, 
N.J., on May 10 during a visit to the Fasano home. The baby is 
named Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the Fasanos, David Cohen, said the custody exchange  
was ``very emotional, very strained, very difficult. This woman 
(Mrs. Fasano) had carried the baby to term, and had cared for him 
for four months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The custody change came to light in papers filed in Manhattan's  
State Supreme Court where the Rogerses asked for declarations that 
they are the infant's parents and that they have permanent custody 
of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Fasano, 37, also gave birth to a white boy -- Joseph's  
fraternal twin -- who is genetically hers and her husband's. The 
Fasanos have said they wanted the boys to grow up knowing each 
other as brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a visitation agreement worked out, but I'm not  
going to talk about the details of it,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Perry-Rogers, 33, is a nurse; her husband, 35, is a  
teacher. Both the Fasanos work in finance. 
</P>
<P>
	The embryo imbroglio happened at the Manhattan fertility clinic  
of Dr. Lillian Nash. Mrs. Fasano and Mrs. Perry-Rogers had stored 
fertilized eggs at the clinic and both visited on April 24, 1998, 
for embryo implantation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Nash's associate, Dr. Michael Obasaju, has admitted that he  
mistakenly put some of Mrs. Perry-Rogers' embryos into a catheter 
used to implant Mrs. Fasano's embryos, a state Health Department 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fasanos and the Rogerses have sued Nash and Obasaju for  
unspecified damages.

<HEADLINE> Gun Groups Press For Enforcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gun murders in Richmond, Va.., fell by 41  
percent after prosecutors there started an effort to put any felon 
caught carrying a gun in prison for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	So why doesn't the Clinton administration follow that model  
nationwide, the National Rifle Association and other gun control 
opponents want to know. Federal prosecutors could crack down on gun 
crime by enforcing the laws already on the books, rather than 
pushing for new ones, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress debates a slate of gun control proposals that gained  
support from lawmakers after the Littleton, Colo., high school 
shootings, the question of whether the federal government does 
enough to enforce those existing laws has re-emerged as a key 
dispute. Republicans were expected to grill Clinton administration 
officials on the issue at a hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can talk about the culture of violence for the next 10  
years. Unless you start prosecution, you're never going to cut the 
culture of violence,'' said Glen Caroline, director of the NRA's 
grassroots division. 
</P>
<P>
	Since President Clinton took office, federal prosecutions of  
gun-related crimes have dropped more than 40 percent, the NRA says. 
The nation has a zero-tolerance policy against young people 
bringing guns to school, for example, yet the federal government 
prosecuted just eight children for that in the last two years, says 
James Baker, the group's chief lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration says gun groups use the wrong  
statistics, looking only at the drop in prosecutions since 1992, 
when violent crime overall and thus prosecutions began to drop 
after historic highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun groups also ignore the recent federal efforts to work with  
local police to prevent illegal gun sales, and to go after those 
who commit crimes with guns and the dealers who illegally supply 
them, the administration says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is disingenuous for them to criticize when they are looking  
at the wrong numbers,'' said Justice Department spokesman Brian 
Steel, who says federal, state and local prosecutions combined are 
on the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, federal laws often are meant more to prevent gun  
violence -- by keeping felons from buying guns, for example -- than 
as tools for prosecutors. The Brady Law's instant background checks 
have prevented 250,000 felons from buying guns, Steel says. 
</P>
<P>
	And some crimes, such as those by teen-agers and children, are  
simply better handled by local authorities, said Attorney General 
Janet Reno, herself a former state attorney from Dade County, Fla. 
Nevertheless, officials do plan to review ``just what needs to be 
done with state and local authorities to ensure the appropriate 
prosecution of these cases,'' she said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Even gun-control advocates, however, say more could be done. The  
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms should be more aggressive 
in putting out of business any licensed gun dealer who breaks 
federal rules, says Douglas Weil, research director for the Center 
to Prevent Handgun Violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The program begun in Richmond, called Project Exile and praised  
by the NRA in newspaper ads and before Congress, has dominated much 
of the debate. Rochester, N.Y., also has signed on. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton praised the program in a March radio address with  
Richmond's police chief at his side, but the NRA complains that the 
Clinton administration isn't providing money to duplicate the 
effort nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to give cities the flexibility to do whatever works in  
their community,'' Steel said. ``Richmond had a particular problem 
with convicted felons getting guns. Boston had a problem with 
gangs. They used different strategies, and they both had success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Boston program that started in 1995, tracing where  
young criminals got their guns, became a precursor of the ATF 
effort to trace guns used in juvenile crime -- a program Clinton is 
expanding. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill the Senate passed last week includes a measure that would  
revoke gun ownership rights for anyone convicted as a juvenile of a 
firearms crime, would institute new background checks at gun shows 
and pawn shops and would require that safety devices be sold with 
all new handguns. The House is expected to take up similar 
proposals in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even as lawmakers consider such new restrictions, some  
insist the focus should be on enforcement, perhaps by giving more 
money to police and to federal prosecutors or to gun-safety 
education programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``To really maximize our impact ... we've got to prosecute the  
laws we've got,'' said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.

<HEADLINE> Teen Abortion Bill Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eileen Roberts said she didn't find out about  
her daughter's abortion until the 14-year-old became depressed and 
needed hospitalization and $27,000 in additional medical care, 
including corrective surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Mrs. Roberts urged a House Judiciary panel to help  
make it a crime for a nonparent to transport an underage girl out 
of state for an abortion if doing so would violate parental 
involvement laws in the child's home state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here today to ask this committee to reject the eccentric  
notion that any adult stranger has the right to abduct our 
minor-aged daughters and take them to another state for a secret 
abortion,'' said Mrs. Roberts of Fredericksburg, Va., whose 
daughter was driven 45 miles from her home for an abortion. 
Virginia requires that the parents of underaged girls seeking 
abortions be notified. 
</P>
<P>
	But Billie Lominick of Newbury, S.C., opposed the bill. She said  
she would be in jail if such a law had been in effect for helping 
her grandson's girlfriend -- who had been abused by her parents -- 
get to Georgia for an abortion this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please don't pass this law,'' said Mrs. Lominick, whose home  
state also requires parental consent before an abortion can be 
performed on a minor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., chairman of the House Judiciary's  
constitution subcommittee, said the measure would uphold parental 
consent or notification laws in the more than 30 states that have 
enacted them. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the bill -- which died in the Senate last year  
after passing the House -- also would protect vulnerable girls from 
being spirited away for abortions by the self-serving, older men 
who get them pregnant 
</P>
<P>
	Canady said it was appropriate for Congress, with its powers to  
regulate interstate commerce, to enact such legislation. ``The 
safety of young girls and the rights of parents demand no less,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., criticized the proposal as a  
``thinly veiled attempt to chip away at a constitutionally 
protected rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is unnecessary,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Abortion rights groups also oppose the bill, arguing that it  
would endanger the health of young girls, similar to those in Mrs. 
Lominick's case, who fear involving their parents in the decision 
to terminate an unplanned pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Penalties in the bill would not apply if the abortion was  
necessary to save the girl's life, and parents may sue the 
individuals who take their daughters away. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the White House and many Democrats opposed the bill --  
which is identical to the version considered Thursday -- and sought 
changes that, among other things, would exempt close family members 
from criminal and civil liability.

<HEADLINE> GOP Celebrates Welfare Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Bill Archer, a top House Republican,  
still remembers being called names when he pushed the 1996 welfare 
overhaul, so he's feeling more than a little vindicated by the good 
news so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where are the children starving on the sewer grates?'' he  
asked Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Releasing a report on welfare reform, GOP leaders celebrated the  
diminishing welfare rolls and rising work rates, dismissing 
anything negative. Any problems are like ``cracks'' in the Sistine 
Chapel's ceiling, said Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., a lead author of the welfare bill, said  
the new report proves the overhaul was ``undoubtedly the most 
successful piece of legislation in this half century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, by the General Accounting Office, reviews a handful  
of the state studies on people who have left welfare and finds most 
people are working. But those same studies suggest former welfare 
recipients have not escaped poverty and are struggling to get by. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer and Shaw dismissed questions about those findings. They  
rejected warnings that things may get tougher when the economy 
worsens or when people use up their five-year lifetime limit on 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Skepticism comes from the same people who opposed welfare reform  
in the first place, said a defiant Archer. He seemed to welcome the 
chance to swing back at them, saying he feels vindicated by welfare 
rolls that are at a 30-year low and little evidence of severe 
hardships predicted by advocates for the poor and some Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``They called me a Nazi. They called me Hitler. They called me  
mean-spirited and said I wanted children starving on the sewer 
grates,'' he said. ``We had a job to do and we plowed through all 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can pick at anything,'' he added. ``Are we better off now  
that we were before? That's the question that's got to be asked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others -- even those who supported the reforms -- say it's too  
early to declare success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't won yet,'' said Rep. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md, who  
voted for the welfare bill. He said declaring victory is ``either 
naive or political'' given that many questions remain. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I really regret is they give the public the impression  
the job's been done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Segal, who heads the cheerleading Welfare to Work  
Partnership, agrees that there is more work to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't kid ourselves,'' he said. ``Many people, at best, are  
going from welfare to the working poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., who chairs the Ways and Means  
welfare subcommittee, said she would continue to work on the issue. 
But she also dismissed critics who say people leaving the rolls are 
having trouble making it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very hard to live on welfare,'' she said. And most people  
leaving the rolls, even if they take minimum wage jobs, make more 
than they got on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert joined the celebratory news  
conference, though he was less gleeful. He said he was encouraged 
by Vice President Al Gore's suggestion that faith-based groups can 
be more involved in social programs. And he suggested that more 
work remains.

<HEADLINE>  Miss Botswana Crowned Miss Universe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAGUARAMAS, Trinidad (AP) -- The three beautiful women left on  
stage were from different continents, but they agreed completely on 
the final question: What if Miss Universe became pregnant during 
her reign -- in violation of the rules? 
</P>
<P>
	Bend them, said Miss Spain, Diana Nogueria. Ditto, said Miss  
Philippines, Miriam Quiambao. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Botswana also agreed. But whereas her predecessors hemmed  
and hawed, 19-year-old Mpule Kwelagobe (mm-POO'-leh 
tkweh-lah-HOH-beh) was proudly resolute. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I think it should not in any way interrupt her  
duties,'' she declared to wild applause from the Trinidadian 
audience. ``She should celebrate her femininity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And thus did the lithe aspiring electrical engineer manifest the  
characteristic that world boxing champ and Miss Universe judge 
Evander Holyfield said he was seeking: confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	First runner-up was Quiambao, a 23-year-old physical therapist  
who turned a fall in preliminaries last week into a plus with a 
much-discussed graceful recovery. Nogueria, a 24-year-old who works 
in the fashion world, came in third. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Photogenic went to Miss Puerto Rico, Brenda Liz Lopez, 23,  
and Miss Congeniality to Marisa Ferreira, a 21-year-old student 
from Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been a rollercoaster ride for the 83 contestants as well  
as for their Trinidadian hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	The latter, delighted with the tremendous exposure on live TV to  
80 countries, turned the event into a celebration of their 
twin-island nation's cosmopolitan society, which borrows from 
African, East Indian and British culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's distinctive steel drum music throbbed in the  
auditorium, which was decorated with the vibrant colors of 
Trinidadian art. A troupe sporting feathered costumes showed why 
Trinidad's carnival is one of the best in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, pageant officials scrambled to prepare a new  
site for the post-pageant coronation ball as hundreds demonstrated 
near the old site, where a worker had been electrocuted to death 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	After Kwelagobe was crowned by the outgoing Miss Universe,  
Trinidad's Wendy Fitzwilliam, she said she wanted to follow her 
example in fighting AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	``I come from the area with the highest incidence of AIDS in the  
world,'' Kwelagobe said of sub-Saharan Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	She told reporters at a news conference that her first name  
means ``bring the rain'' -- and that she hoped to do just that for 
her drought-plagued southern African homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning won't just change my life, it will change Botswana,''  
Kwelagobe said, hopeful that her victory would ``open Botswana to 
the world'' and bring in development and investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwelagobe described herself as ``very focused, determined and  
ambitious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has studied subjects alien to most African women -- pure  
electronics, physics, chemistry and mathematics. Yet pregnancy, she 
said, explaining her winning answer, is ``what it's all about: 
celebrating women, celebrating our femininity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not so clear that pageant officials would agree with her  
views. Earlier in the week Miss Guam, Trisha Heflin, was 
disqualified and sent home, with pageant officials saying she was 
pregnant. Her promoters later insisted she was merely ill.

<HEADLINE> Highway Fatalities Fell in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alcohol-related traffic fatalities hit a  
record low last year as overall deaths on U.S. streets and highways 
declined slightly from the year before, according to preliminary 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 41,480 people were killed on the nation's highways in  
1998, down from 42,103 in 1997, the government calculated for a 
report released Thursday. The 1997 figure was a slight increase 
from 1996, when 42,085 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcohol was involved in 15,936 traffic fatalities last year, or  
38.4 percent of total highway deaths. In 1997, it was a factor in 
16,189 fatalities, or 38.5 percent of the total. Last year's number 
was the lowest level since the government began keeping records in 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary traffic fatality rate remained steady at 1.6  
deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, even though the 
total number of miles driven was up 2 percent from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures were compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration, based on standardized fatal accident reports 
completed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. They will 
be adjusted before a final report is released this fall, and even 
then, there will be further modifications until figures for 1999 
are released next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the government twice reported last year that traffic  
deaths had fallen from 1996 to 1997, but when the latest figures 
were released Thursday, it conceded that late-arriving reports 
pushed the total number of deaths for 1997 past the final number 
for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ricardo Martinez, an emergency room doctor who heads the  
safety administration, noted that 62 percent of those killed last 
year were not wearing seat belts. With the Memorial Day holiday 
coming this weekend, federal, state and local officials are making 
a push to enforce seat belt laws across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been saying for years and it's still true: Buckle up and  
increase your chance of survival,'' Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Truckers celebrated one fact in the report. The number of people  
killed in truck-related accidents last year fell by 96, from 5,398 
people in 1997 to 5,302 in 1998. Congress and the Transportation 
Department this week have been debating ways to make trucks and 
buses more safe to the driving public, after a string of fatal 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand they're preliminary numbers, but they're  
official preliminary numbers and it reverses a trend,'' said Dave 
Osiecki, vice president for safety policy at the American Trucking 
Associations. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than likely, the mileage for trucks will also be up, so  
that will be even better news'' that fewer people died, despite 
more miles driven by trucks, Osiecki said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new report said that deaths of pedestrians on highways were  
down 1.3 percent to 5,284 in 1998, while deaths of motorcyclists 
rose slightly from 2,147 in 1997 to 2,243 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 fatality count was 19 percent lower than it was almost  
two decades ago, in 1979, when 51,093 people were killed on the 
nation's highways. Total U.S. fatalities reached a record low in 
1992, when 39,250 people were killed in highway accidents.

<HEADLINE> Mine Industry Criticizes Noise Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's proposal to  
require additional noise protection at coal, metal and other mines 
met with criticism Wednesday from the mining industry and 
Republican lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Michael B. Enzi, R-Wyo., chairman of the Senate  
subcommittee on employment, safety and training, questioned the 
requirement that mine operators buy quieter machines or rotate 
employees among work stations before resorting to ear plugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have read through this rule several times now, and I have to  
say that it makes no sense to me,'' he said at a hearing. ``I 
seriously question whether those who wrote this rule have ever 
actually been to a mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal was issued in 1996 to help protect miners from  
work-related hearing loss. The Mine Safety and Health 
Administration is considering whether to make any changes before 
finalizing the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Watzman, vice president of safety and health for the  
National Mining Association, said the noise proposal exemplifies 
problems with the agency's process for writing new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a proposal is issued, Watzman said, it is often too late to  
offer alternatives that could be less intrusive or more cost 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the proposal say it imposes unnecessary cost and is  
particularly burdensome to small mine operators already strapped 
for resources. They say noise-protection rules for other industries 
are not as strict. 
</P>
<P>
	Enzi proposed legislation that would require the mine agency to  
meet with panels of small mine operators beforehand to discuss new 
rules and their potential impact. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Davitt McAteer, assistant labor secretary for mine safety and  
health, said such panels would be unnecessary. He said the agency 
already makes efforts to solicit input from mine operators, 
particularly the smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would not change existing noise standards but would  
help prevent about 30,000 cases of hearing loss, McAteer said. 
Without the changes, he said, about 46,000 miners can expect to 
incur serious hearing loss during their lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph A. Main, a health and safety administrator with the  
United Mine Workers of America, said ear plugs do little to protect 
hearing.

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Fans No Fans of Jar-Jar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- And you thought adults hated Barney. Just  
listen to what they're saying about Jar Jar Binks, the flop-eared 
amphibian from the new ``Star Wars'' movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans, echoing the views of a number of film critics, see  
the character as an annoying goofball at best and a racial 
stereotype at worst. 
</P>
<P>
	Since George Lucas' ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom  
Menace'' opened May 19, the Internet has been afire with messages -- 
and several entire Web sites -- calling for no less than the 
annihilation of the creature. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tally so far is running about 10 to 1 in favor a having a  
festive Jar Jar-B-Q,'' said a Web site called Jar Jar Must Die. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday, the Web site deja.com had amassed 15,000 messages  
just about Jar Jar, with many saying they couldn't stand him. 
</P>
<P>
	Jar Jar, a computer-animated character dropped into the frames  
next to the actors, is a bumbling sidekick who steps in animal dung 
and says things like ``yousa'' and ``meesa'' for ``you'' and 
``me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To some, his speech sounds like Caribbean-accented pidgin  
English, and his ears suggest dreadlocks. With his bellbottom pants 
and vest, Jar Jar looks to some like the latest in a long line of 
black stereotypes in movies. (Critics have also complained of Asian 
and Italian stereotypes in other characters.) 
</P>
<P>
	Film critic Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal described  
Jar Jar as ``a Rastafarian Stepin Fetchit on platform hoofs, 
crossed annoyingly with Butterfly McQueen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Barrs, author of ``The Finger'' column in Los Angeles'  
alternative weekly New Times, wrote: ``This digit can only hope 
that Massa George comes to his senses before Episode II and kills 
off shufflin' Jar Jar among others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jar Jar attacks certainly haven't dampened enthusiasm for  
the film, which made more than $100 million in its first week and 
is expected to go over the $200 million mark by the end of Memorial 
Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	But the vitriol has caught the people at Lucas' production  
company by surprise. The filmmaker appears particularly stung by 
the suggestions of racism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing in `Star Wars' was racially motivated,'' said  
Lucasfilm spokeswoman Lynn Hale. ```Star Wars' is a fantasy movie. 
I really do think to dissect this movie as if it had a direct 
reference to the world today is absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the criticism that Jar Jar is a grating presence, she  
said: ``It's a children's movie. Kids love him. He's so childish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As one Jar Jar defender wrote on the Internet: ``Get over  
yourselves. If you want to fight real racist stereotypes do it, but 
stop picking on fictional aliens in a kid's movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The voice of Jar Jar is provided by actor Ahmed Best, who is  
black. He didn't didn't immediately respond to a message left for 
him at Lucasfilm. But during a May 11 Internet chat, he said of the 
character: 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the kids will absolutely love it! I think the fans  
will love it! I know there will be people out there that will want 
to discredit George for putting Jar Jar in the movie ... and I 
think those people should go see something else!''

<HEADLINE> Supply Glut Forces Copper Price Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Copper futures prices plunged 5 percent Thursday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange amid disappointment that producers have not 
acted aggressively to reduce a glut. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee and pork futures also fell sharply.  
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures fell as large trading firms bailed out of the  
market in droves amid frustrations that producers have been 
reluctant to deal effectively with near-record high inventories 
that have sent prices to their lowest in nearly 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Broken Hill Proprietary Co. has delayed until at least the end  
of June a decision on whether to shutter three U.S. mines that 
produce about 200,000 metric tons of copper a year. And Highland 
Valley Copper said it may reopen a mine it closed in mid-May if it 
can reach a collective bargaining agreement with its union. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors had been buying aggressively in recent weeks as they  
bet hot U.S. housing demand and a recovery in Asia's economy would 
work with mine production cutbacks to boost prices. But despite 
perceptions of oversupply, production in the first two months of 
the year jumped 11 percent over the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper is used in the housing sector for wiring, plumbing and  
household appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Martin Squires at Rudolf Wolff also noted the peak  
demand period for copper is coming to an end. Consumption is weaker 
during the slow summer months as factories in Europe and the United 
States cut back production. Inventories typically rise sharply 
during this period. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper for July delivery fell 3.30 cents to 63.15 cents a pound,  
the biggest one-day decline since May 18, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures fell sharply on the Board of Trade of the City of  
New York as meteorologists predicted Brazilian coffee-growing 
regions will remain frost-free over the U.S. Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, has seen cooler  
than normal temperatures ahead of its winter but has so far escaped 
sustained freezing weather that could affect young coffee trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil produces mainly robusta beans, which are not certified  
for delivery against New York futures contracts. But many roasters 
mix those beans with high-quality arabica beans for gourmet blends, 
and record production last year left the world flush with supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	July arabica coffee fell 1.85 cents to $1.23 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Lean hog futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  
amid expectations meat packer supplies will be ample going into the 
busy summer period, reducing the need to slaughter fresh supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices faced continued pressure from the U.S. Agriculture  
Department's monthly cold storage report, which showed frozen pork 
inventories have jumped to 593.510 million pounds, surpassing the 
previous record of 583 million pounds set in April 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	June lean hogs fell 1.83 cents to 52.17 cents a pound; July pork  
bellies fell 1.75 cents to 52.72 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Chickenpox Vaccine Recommended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Federal health officials recommended Thursday  
that all states require chickenpox vaccinations for all children 
entering day care or elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
	The requirements are recommended because the highly contagious  
disease is most prevalent among children ages 1 to 6, said the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 4 million Americans, mostly children, get chickenpox every  
year. Caused by the varicella virus, it typically just causes 
severe itching and rash in children. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC estimates that about 100 people each year from 1990 to  
1994 -- before the vaccination became available -- died from 
complications such as pneumonia, hemorrhaging and blood infections. 
As many as 11,000 are hospitalized annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is data out there to suggest that deaths are continuing  
to occur,'' said Dr. Jane Seward of the CDC's National Immunization 
Program. ``It's not a lot compared to other vaccine-preventable 
diseases but it's too many when you've got a way to prevent them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine is 80 to 90 percent effective, and protects against  
the most severe symptoms of chicken pox in all cases, according to 
the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration approved the nation's first  
chickenpox vaccine, Varivax, in 1995 and the CDC and the American 
Academy of Pediatrics had recommended vaccinating children for 
chickenpox at 12 to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oklahoma, Oregon,  
Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington D.C., have 
already passed laws requiring vaccinations for children.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution Rests in Police Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors in a federal police brutality trial  
ended their case Thursday by showing the jury the whisk half of a 
broken broomstick -- the other half of which, they said, was used to 
torture a Haitian immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	The closing came the same week that one of the defendants  
dropped out of the trial after pleading guilty to the attack, a 
move that the jury was informed of by the trial judge, who denied 
motions to declare a mistrial for the remaining defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	In final prosecution testimony on Thursday, Lt. Vincent DiDonato  
said the broken broom was found during a search of the stationhouse 
six days after Abner Louima was sodomized in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators never recovered the stick used in the attack,  
which shocked the city for its alleged brutality and has strained 
police relations with minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Alan Vinegrad walked in front of the jury box holding  
up the broken broom before announcing that the prosecution was 
resting after a month of testimony by 50 witnesses and a dramatic 
guilty plea by the lead defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, defense attorney Stephen Worth described the  
finale as ``a prosecutorial cheap shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a technique called waving the bloody shirt,'' he said.  
``There absolutely no proof that this is the other half of the 
notorious stick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Officer Justin Volpe shook the trial by  
pleading guilty to civil rights charges. He could be sentenced to 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, 27, admitted ramming a stick into a handcuffed Louima's  
rectum, pulling it out and putting it up to his face to humiliate 
him. He said he mistakenly believed the prisoner had punched him 
when police tried to quell a disturbance outside a nightclub in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Charles Schwarz faces the most serious charge among the  
remaining four defendants -- that he held Louima, 32, down in the 
bathroom assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz and Officers Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder also are  
charged with beating Louima in a patrol car en route to the police 
precinct. Sgt. Michael Bellomo, their supervisor, is charged with 
covering up the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resumes Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi Posts Modest Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Mitsubishi Motors Corp. posted a modest profit last  
year in contrast to a loss a year earlier, as cost cutting and a 
gain on the sale of a manufacturing facility contributed to the 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvement also reflected a return to profitability at  
subsidiaries in the United States, Europe and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a sign that business conditions overall are still bleak,  
the company skipped its year-end dividend payment for the second 
straight year and said it expects a smaller profit this year on a 
slight sales increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned 5.67 billion yen, or $46 million, for the  
fiscal year ended March 31 versus a loss of 101.85 billion in 
fiscal 1997 when auto demand slumped in Japan and other 
recession-stricken Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi said earnings were boosted by the sale of a Tokyo  
truck-transmission plant but did not say how much. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 6 percent to 3.51 trillion yen, or $28.67 billion,  
from 3.74 trillion yen a year ago amid a continued slump in auto 
demand at home and in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi expects profit to fall to 2 billion yen on sales of  
3.52 trillion yen this fiscal year which ends in March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports are expected to drop because of falling shipments to  
Latin America and the Middle East, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Want Investigation of GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats want the Justice Department and  
Congress to investigate whether House Republican leaders are 
violating campaign finance laws with a planned $25 million fund for 
key House races next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers to the House's third-ranking Republican, Majority Whip  
Tom DeLay of Texas, created the Republican Majority Issues Campaign 
to raise and spend that much in two dozen races in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois, Majority Leader Dick  
Armey of Texas and the No. 4 Republican, Oklahoma's J.C. Watts, 
chairman of the Republican Conference, also are raising money for 
the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign finance watchdog groups criticized the fund-raising  
strategy on a variety of fronts -- not the least of which is 
organizers' decision to keep their donor list secret. 
</P>
<P>
	``For members of Congress to set up an invisible slush fund to  
collect $25 million to influence the 2000 elections raises all 
sorts of questions,'' Larry Makinson, executive director of the 
Center for Responsive Politics, said today. ``Who's giving the 
money? What promises are being made, either explicit or 
understood?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the chairman and top Democrat on the House ethics  
committee took the unusual step of releasing a letter saying the 
panel had not approved the GOP leaders' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Approval from the ethics committee ``was never sought and, thus,  
never granted,'' wrote the chairman, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, and 
Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign's organizer, Karl Gallant, said his fund meets all  
federal election laws and simply mirrors get-out-the-vote and issue 
advocacy campaigns by organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
	He contended the fund's activities do not have to be disclosed  
because it will operate independently and will not explicitly 
advocate for or against individual candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It absolutely amazes me that Big Labor can go out and mobilize  
liberal votes ... but suddenly conservatives don't have First 
Amendment rights,'' he said Thursday, adding that his ``grudging 
admiration'' for the AFL-CIO's advocacy campaign prompted him to 
emulate that effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallant said he will not disclose contributors' names because it  
would put the campaign at a ``strategic disadvantage'' to unions. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the AFL-CIO contributed $35 million in an unsuccessful  
effort to help Democrats retake control of the House. Union leaders 
are pledging more than $40 million for television ads and 
mobilizing voters next year. 
</P>
<P>
	One request for an investigation came in a letter this week to  
Attorney General Janet Reno from Robert Bauer, an attorney for the 
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department declined comment Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	DeLay's congressional aides referred questions to Gallant, who  
previously headed DeLay's leadership political action committee. 
Armey's office declined comment, as did Watts'. Hastert's spokesman 
could not be reached immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the top Democrat on the House Government Reform  
Committee asked the panel's chairman, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., to 
include the GOP fund raising in the committee's current 
investigation of Democratic fund-raising abuses from the 1996 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	A committee spokesman, Mark Corallo, said the letter from Rep.  
Henry Waxman, D-Calif., has not been received.

<HEADLINE> Rik Smits Won't Get Needed Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Rik Smits could use some rest for his aching  
size 21 feet. The Indiana center knows he won't be getting much 
going against Patrick Ewing as the Pacers and New York Knicks clash 
in the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The big toe on his left foot, which was fractured during  
Indiana's first-round sweep of Milwaukee, has complicated matters 
for Smits. 
</P>
<P>
	``My broken toe is giving me a lot of trouble,'' Smits said  
Thursday after the team practiced at Market Square Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana hasn't played since it completed its sweep of  
Philadelphia in the second round Sunday, providing a one-week break 
before Game 1 in the conference finals at Market Square Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping the days off would help it, but I don't really  
feel that it has,'' said Smits, who is averaging 11.1 points in the 
playoffs after averaging a career-low 14.9 points in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Smits averaged 14.7 points as Indiana won the season series with  
the Knicks 2-1, including a 94-71 rout in their last game here on 
May 2. Ewing was the top scorer for New York with a 22.7 average, 
and Smits thinks the rest the Knicks have had since completing 
their sweep of Atlanta on Monday will benefit the New York veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	The two centers have had several big battles in their careers,  
which include four previous playoff series since 1993. The Knicks 
won the first two playoff series and Indiana has won the last two. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-4 Smits has been doing much of his scoring in the  
playoffs from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel my weakness now is back to the basket, pivoting.  
Recovery time is not as good as it used to be. Jumping ability is 
pretty much gone, not that I had much to begin with,'' he said. 
``It will probably be the summer before (the feet) start feeling 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smits was a major reason the Pacers took Chicago to seven games  
in last year's conference finals, averaging 16.3 points on 55 
percent shooting from the field. He set a franchise playoff record 
by hitting 11-of-12 shots from the field in Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers' center has had his share of success against New  
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is usually because they had single coverage on me and I got  
a chance to do some stuff in the low post,'' he said. ``This season 
they would keep a forward on me and keep Ewing down low. Sometimes 
they had Larry Johnson on me and that gave me a big height 
advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, who has been hobbled by Achilles' tendinitis and sore  
knees, isn't the only Knick that concerns Smits. His backup, Chris 
Dudley, led the Knicks in rebounding against Atlanta and had 14 
points, 12 rebounds and two blocked shots in Game 3 of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley's preformance in that game, a 90-77 victory, allowed  
Ewing to sit out the entire fourth quarter. Ewing then scored 17 
points and grabbed a team-high nine rebounds as New York ended the 
series with a 79-66 win to complete its sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dudley, the last two games has been real active offensively,''  
Smits said. ``It used to be he was just a banger, a rebounder who 
works hard all the time. You really didn't have to worry too much 
about him on offense. Patrick is much more offensive minded.''

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Protest in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- In the first violent confrontation since the  
Israeli election, club-wielding Israeli police charged into a crowd 
of Palestinian protesters today to keep them away from a Jewish 
neighborhood under construction in disputed east Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters, among them also Israeli peace activists and Arab  
Israeli lawmakers, rattled the fence ringing the four-acre plot 
owned by Irving Moskowitz, a Florida millionaire and benefactor of 
Jewish settler groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Police, some on horseback, pushed and shoved protesters and beat  
a bodyguard for Faisal Husseini, the top PLO official in Jerusalem. 
Husseini also was slightly injured in the scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said four people,  
including two journalists, were detained on suspicion they attacked 
police officers. They were later released. 
</P>
<P>
	The disputed site is in Ras al-Amud, a neighborhood of 11,000  
Palestinians in east Jerusalem, the sector captured by Israel from 
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and claimed by the Palestinians as a 
future capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Moskowitz hopes to build 132 homes for Jews on his plot.  
Construction began last week, a day after Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu was trounced in general elections by opposition leader 
Ehud Barak. Netanyahu, apparently concerned about widespread 
Palestinian riots, had held up construction on security grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Husseini said the building by Jerusalem settlers violates  
U.S.-brokered peace agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a unilateral act,'' a hoarse Husseini said after being  
shoved by policemen. ``Those people are trying to make a new 
reality, to make it impossible to reach any kind of peace 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ras al-Amud dispute will become one of the first tests of  
Barak's new government, said Israeli Arab lawmaker Hashem Mahmeed, 
who joined the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barak should make his stance felt about what happened here and  
about the settlement attempts on this piece of Palestinian land,'' 
Mahmeed said. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat demanded that  
Barak halt the Ras al-Amud project and construction in the larger 
Har Homa neighborhood in east Jerusalem when he takes power. In Har 
Homa, known in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim, 6,500 apartments for 
Jews are to be built. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian Authority demands the ``immediate cessation of  
all settlement activity launched by the previous government and the 
return of all lands grabbed for settlement,'' said the aide, Tayeb 
Abdel Rahim, the secretary general of the Palestinian Authority.

<HEADLINE> Farm Disaster Payouts Due Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers waiting for $2 billion in emergency  
disaster aid will begin to see checks next week, Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those payments will begin next week,'' Glickman told a Senate  
Agriculture hearing, adding that payments to 266,000 farmers will 
begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was included in an overall $6 billion farm aid package  
passed by Congress last fall. The Clinton administration already 
used $400 million of the $2.3 billion in disaster payments to lower 
farmers' 1999 crop insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``This assistance should provide additional, needed relief to  
farmers still reeling from recent costly natural disasters,'' 
Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers will be paid 84.9 percent of qualifying single-year or  
multiyear losses, officials said. The average payment is about 
$7,000. The maximum is $67,920. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman and his agency have been widely criticized for the  
delay in distributing the money, which passed Congress in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman has maintained that the massive aid package, which  
included provisions for everyone from dairy to grain farmers, was 
``complex'' to administer. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency distributed $2.8 billion in payments to compensate  
for low prices shortly after the package was passed. But 
distributing the $2.3 billion in disaster payments, which cover 
disasters and disease, was burdensome, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	One complication was that the emergency package covered farmers  
who have suffered crop losses over several years before 1998 or who 
had losses only in 1998 -- a provision that took an enormous amount 
of time to compile. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the disaster package included seven new programs,  
including aid for livestock and dairy farmers, Glickman has said.

<HEADLINE> New Russian PM Says He's in Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin began his first  
Cabinet meeting today by trying to squelch speculation he is not in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin, who was confirmed just last week, already is  
embroiled in a growing political row over who is running the 
government. His deputy, First Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai 
Aksyonenko, created an uproar earlier by suggesting he would 
oversee all government policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking grim, Stepashin attempted to assert his authority  
Thursday, saying that ministers should stick to their specific 
areas of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to avoid various sorts of talk of who is the boss in  
the government, I state that its chairman (the prime minister) 
leads the government, and he is responsible for all that happens 
with the government,'' Stepashin said in his opening remarks, some 
of which were broadcast on national television. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not a promising start for a government facing the huge  
task of reviving an economy battered by years of depression. 
Stepashin was made premier after the abrupt dismissal earlier this 
month of Yevgeny Primakov. 
</P>
<P>
	The new government has yet to voice any clear policies, and  
Stepashin appears to be under the firm control of President Boris 
Yeltsin, who can remove him at any time. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin also told the ministers that Cabinet meetings would be  
strictly controlled, with set amounts of time for reports and 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no time to sit for four, five hours,'' Stepashin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin's control of the government was questioned after  
numerous Russian press reports said Aksyonenko was attempting to 
assert direct control over all policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Aksyonenko fueled the speculation, telling the Echo of Moscow  
radio station Wednesday that he would oversee the Cabinet's work in 
``all fields.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aksyonenko, whose candidacy was reportedly backed by  
controversial business tycoon Boris Berezovsky and Yeltsin's 
family, has insisted he will have control over all economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest intrigue looked like the handiwork of the president,  
who often pits his ministers against each other to keep them in 
check. On Wednesday, he snubbed Stepashin's choice for the other 
first deputy prime minister spot, naming former Finance Minister 
Mikhail Zadornov to the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin denied Thursday that there  
was any conflict over formation of the government, saying it was 
difficult to put together the right combination of people. 
</P>
<P>
	Confusion continued over the appointment of the finance  
minister. The Kremlin initially reported that Zadornov would retain 
the post, but Yeltsin then appointed Mikhail Kasyanov as finance 
minister. There were unconfirmed reports Wednesday that Yeltsin had 
decided to reinstate Zadornov. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Zadornov and Yakushkin refused to clarify the situation  
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Could Open Houston Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Astros are negotiating with the New  
York Yankees to stage an exhibition game next spring that would 
inaugurate the Astros' new downtown park. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a contest at the new Enron Field would duplicate the  
ceremonial first game at the Astrodome when the world's first domed 
stadium opened April 9, 1965, Houston officials told television 
station KRIV Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros are vacating the Astrodome after this season for a  
new retractable-roof $265 million palace downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just thought that would be a nice touch since that's how  
the Astrodome was originally opened,'' Bob McClaren, the Astros' 
senior vice president, said. ``That's when Mickey Mantle hit the 
first home run in the Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought the New York Yankees would be an appropriate team  
to play as an exhibition game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McClaren said the discussions are with Brian Cashman, the  
Yankees' general manager and with the approval of New York owner 
George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brian has explained the relationship between George  
Steinbrenner and (Astros owner) Drayton McLane is very strong,'' 
McClaren said. ``I know George would like to do this. So we are 
trying to make it all happen.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Balances Golf, Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- President Clinton ventured to the edge of his  
vacation retreat Thursday, coming out on a dirt road to speak about 
the indictment of Slobodan Milosevic. Then he went right back to 
his house in the midst of a vast nature preserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Midway through his second day on vacation, Clinton put on a  
yellow-patterned tie, a blue blazer and khakis, hopped in a bronze 
Chevy Suburban and made the short trip down an unpaved road to a 
guard shack posted at the entrance of White Oak Plantation. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd come to say for television cameras what he had already said  
on paper: that he was pleased with a war crime tribunal's 
indictment of the Yugoslav president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having a good time?'' Clinton asked reporters as he approached  
a hastily erected lectern beside the guard shack. Someone turned 
the question on him, asking if he and the first lady were enjoying 
their time together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh yeah. We need it,'' Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the only answer Clinton offered Thursday. He didn't  
respond to questions on Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he rode back up the road to his vacation cottage -- if a  
two-story, five-bedroom house with cedar paneling can qualify as a 
cottage. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the Clintons had kept  
busy and were not ``anxious to get out and travel around.'' They've 
been cooking their own dinners rather than eat in White Oak's 
dining rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's quite a nice complex, and I think they're enjoying  
themselves and relaxing,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's day Thursday included making phone calls to French  
President Jacques Chirac, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and 
Czech President Vaclav Havel. He talked with Chirac and Blair about 
the NATO mission, but the call to Havel was more personal; Clinton 
wanted to check up on Havel's recovery after a hospital stay. 
</P>
<P>
	After his brief appearance, Clinton was going golfing. Lockhart  
said Clinton has been playing with the golf pros who work at White 
Oak, mainly a bunch of 25- to 30-year-olds who Clinton described as 
``excellent teachers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He said the round yesterday was one long lesson,'' Lockhart  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than golf, Clinton roamed the 7,500-acre preserve and saw  
zebras, rhinos and a baby giraffe. Lockhart said Clinton came away 
saying he saw more animals than he had last year on safari in 
Botswana.

<HEADLINE> Attitude Led Atwater to Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Safety Steve Atwater feels that the New  
York Jets' decision to sign him after he was released by Denver in 
March had as much to do with his performance off the field as on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the situation in Denver, when Denver released me, I  
didn't show any bitterness toward them,'' Atwater said during the 
Jets' veterans minicamp Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may have showed (Bill Parcells) that I'm a mature guy,  
not a guy that lets that stuff bother me. I know a lot of people 
maybe would have handled it differently. I handled it the way I 
honestly felt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Atwater's talent didn't hurt, either. Parcells, in  
desperate need of a free safety, quickly snatched up the 10-year 
veteran for three years and $7.2 million, including a $2.8 million 
signing bonus, to anchor a defensive backfield that also includes 
Pro Bowl cornerback Aaron Glenn and hard-hitting strong safety 
Victor Green. 
</P>
<P>
	That Atwater, 32, was jettisoned by the Broncos as being a step  
too slow and a bit too expensive didn't bother Parcells much. In 
the Jets' 23-10 loss at Denver in January's AFC title game, the 
6-3, 217-pound safety forced a key fourth-quarter fumble with an 
open-field tackle of receiver Alex Van Dyke, effectively ending a 
comeback attempt by Parcells' club. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, if I didn't have full confidence that he was able  
to do what we're asking him to do, he wouldn't be here,'' Parcells 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater finished last season fourth among Broncos in  
regular-season tackles (85), earning his eighth Pro Bowl selection. 
Among Denver players, only now-retired quarterback John Elway, with 
nine, had more. 
</P>
<P>
	``My driving force right now is to play at a level that I feel  
comfortable playing at,'' said Atwater, who has almost 1,300 career 
tackles. ``I don't think I've reached that level the past two or 
three years. Sure, I've been to the Pro Bowl two of the last three 
years, but that's not what I base my performance on. I know that I 
can get to that point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's decision to cut him, which came on the heels of a  
frustrating season that saw him sometimes replaced on passing 
downs, is a motivating factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to prove the Broncos wrong,'' he said. ``I want  
to show everybody that I can still do it like I did it two or three 
years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran, who has undergone seven surgeries, including five  
on his shoulders, in recent years, still has his supporters around 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first thought, when the Jets signed him, was that obviously  
the Jets are truly trying to make their Super Bowl run this year,'' 
said Les Steckel, the Broncos tight ends coach in 1993 and '94 and 
now offensive coordinator for the Tennessee Titans. ``He's the 
biggest, fastest, hardest-hitting safety I can think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Jets linebacker Bryan Cox: ``Nobody's going to be catching  
the ball over the middle against us anymore. Those plays are 
gone.''

<HEADLINE> 13 Named National Heritage Fellows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Folk artists ranging from a Haitian drummer in  
Brooklyn to a Ukrainian weaver in New Jersey are among 13 National 
Heritage fellows for 1999 selected by the National Endowment for 
the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	They are ``outstanding artists ... who have dedicated their  
lives to preserving, reviving and celebrating this country's living 
cultural heritage,'' said NEA Chairman Bill Ivey. The awards were 
to be presented on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Drummer Frisner Augustin promotes Haitian music throughout the  
hemisphere with a group called ``La Troupe Makandal.'' He has 
taught at Columbia University and New York University, toured 
extensively and made four commercial recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	Another kind of drummer is Zakir Hussain. His specialty is the  
tabla drum of northern India, an expertise learned from his father. 
At 7, he began a career that has spanned four decades and several 
continents to his home in San Anselmo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott Mannette of Morgantown, W.Va., works in the steel drum  
tradition and has been called ``the father of the modern steel 
band.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weaving Ukrainian textiles is the specialty of Eudokia  
Sorochaniuk, whose family fled the Soviet Union during World War 
II. She now lives in Pennsauken, N. J., where she makes costumes 
for her husband's music and dance group. She has also visited 
Ukraine to help teach the skills she conserved. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfredo Campos of Federal Way, Wash., brought his craft from the  
family ranch in Arizona, creating horse gear from rawhide and 
braiding lariats and making quirts, reins and other equipment. He 
also makes special tools for Boeing jet planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lila Greengrass Blackdeer makes baskets, moccasins and other  
traditional native American items in Black River Falls, Wis., while 
Mary Louise Defender Wilson of Shields, N.D., maintains the 
tradition of the Standing Rock Sioux with stories that embody their 
system of beliefs and behavior. Ulysses Goode of the Western Monos 
in North Fork, Calif., weaves baskets and teaches the art. 
</P>
<P>
	Music is also represented by Mick Moloney of Philadelphia, a  
singer and string player -- mandolin, mandola, bouzouki and guitar -- 
who has made his career in Irish music, by African-American gospel 
singer Shirley Caesar of Durham, N.C., and by Ozark Mountain 
fiddler Bob Holt of Ava, Mo., who has been performing for half a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Godbolt of Hanson, Mass., tap-danced for Duke Ellington  
and Count Basie. He won a Tony nomination for his work in the 1989 
musical ``Black and Blue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph W. Stanley comes from a long line of Maine boat builders,  
creating and restoring wooden boats, from lobstering vessels to 
racing sloops. He lives in Southwest Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Each fellow gets a $10,000 award and will be honored in a White  
House ceremony. Since 1982 the NEA has made 224 such awards.

<HEADLINE> NATO Keeps Up Pressure With Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO warplanes pounded more targets  
in Belgrade and throughout Yugoslavia early today while reports 
surfaced that the Yugoslav president has been indicted on war 
crimes charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Planes roared over Belgrade, and the rattle of heavy  
anti-aircraft fire resounded in the capital soon after air raid 
sirens sounded. Powerful explosions were heard in the city's New 
Belgrade area and the southern district of Rakovica, where thick, 
black smoke was seen rising from an engine factory. 
</P>
<P>
	The private Studio B television said 53 missiles hit Belgrade  
and the surrounding area overnight in one of the fiercest NATO 
attacks on the capital since the bombing started March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, NATO said it flew a record 741 sorties on Day 64 of its  
air campaign, including 308 strike sorties and 74 others designed 
to suppress Serbian air defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-country alliance said the strikes hit a wide range of  
targets, including artillery and armor in Kosovo and strategic 
targets across Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Tanjug news agency said NATO struck a ministry  
building in New Belgrade that coordinates imports and exports of 
weapons, but the missiles did not explode. 
</P>
<P>
	Local media reported that two children and a woman were killed  
and several people were injured in Ralja, 18 miles south of 
Belgrade, when a missile struck residential buildings. Tanjug said 
three people were killed and two injured when NATO bombed two 
villages in the Kosovska Vitina area southeast of Pristina, 
Kosovo's provincial capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports could not be independently confirmed.  
</P>
<P>
	Serbian media also said a series of ``exceptionally strong  
explosions'' echoed early today from the direction of the Batajnica 
military airport, northwest of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Also reportedly targeted early today were an industrial zone in  
Nis, Yugoslavia's third-largest city, a communication tower near 
Novi Sad in the north of the country and a hill near Belgrade where 
an underground military complex is believed to be located. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Netherlands, the international war crimes tribunal based  
scheduled a press conference today to make an ``important 
announcement.'' U.S. officials in Washington, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said an indictment against Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic had been issued by the U.N. court, accusing him 
of atrocities in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another way of squeezing him and actively trying to stop  
him,'' a diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
told The Associated Press at NATO headquarters in Brussels, 
Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	China and Russia both have expressed concern that a possible  
indictment would harm the search for a political solution for 
Kosovo, a province in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian special envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin delayed his return to  
Yugoslavia after marathon talks Wednesday and today with U.S. and 
European representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin was to hold a final meeting in Moscow with Deputy  
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Finnish President Martti 
Ahtisaari before departing later today. It was not clear whether he 
would be carrying any major new proposals to Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia wants a political solution to the Kosovo crisis, but has  
made little progress. Russia also is pushing for an immediate pause 
in NATO airstrikes to give breathing room to diplomatic efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Yugoslav capital, Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic told  
a key U.N. envoy that his country continued to reject the 
deployment of foreign troops in Kosovo, state-run television 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	He told Undersecretary-General Sergio Vieira de Mello, who has  
been heading a U.N. fact-finding tour, that the United Nations 
should take firm measures to halt NATO ``aggression'' and create 
``conditions for a political solution in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic repeatedly has rejected the key element of a  
U.S.-backed peace plan for Kosovo -- the deployment of as many as 
50,000 NATO-led troops to secure the safe return of hundreds of 
thousands Kosovo Albanian refugees who have fled his crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. aid officials said today the latest surge of refugees  
fleeing to Macedonia from Kosovo had suddenly slowed to a trickle. 
Only about 60 ethnic Albanians crossed the border Wednesday after 
6,000 to 8,000 arrived daily during the previous four days. 
</P>
<P>
	The border crossing was quiet this morning.  
</P>
<P>
	Residents reached by phone in Pristina said buses that had been  
carrying people to the border stopped running Wednesday. It was not 
known why. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 840,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have fled  
Kosovo since March. Before the allied campaign began, Kosovo had a 
population of about 2 million, of which 90 percent were ethnic 
Albanians.

black man beside their pickup truck for a quarter-mile, and federal 
authorities have been asked to examine whether it was a bias crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, investigators and even the victim's family are not sure  
the incident early Wednesday -- which did not result in serious 
injuries -- was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no indication at this point that it is,'' said  
Williamsburg County Sheriff Kelvin Washington, who asked the FBI 
and State Law Enforcement Division to look into whether the 
victim's civil rights were violated. ``There is a possibility that 
it may be drug related.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric W. Jones, 38, of Gastonia, N.C., and Arthur Marshall, 34,  
of Georgetown were to be formally charged today with assault and 
battery with intent to kill. Marshall also was charged with 
possession of a stolen vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Charone Green was grabbed and dragged when he  
approached a pickup truck that had slowed in front of his cousin's 
house on a rural road in the Bloomingvale community, about 90 miles 
east of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, 23, told investigators he was standing at the end of a  
driveway when two men pulled up in a red pickup truck and told him 
to come over. He said the passenger grabbed his arm and the truck 
drove off, Chief Deputy Dwight Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	A cousin who witnessed it said Green broke free when the truck  
hit a culvert. 
</P>
<P>
	Green's grandmother, Mary Green, said last June's dragging death  
of a black man in Texas was the first thing that popped in her mind 
she heard what happened. One man has been convicted of murder and 
sentenced to death in that case, while trials are pending for two 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she wasn't sure the attack on her grandson was  
similarly motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say whether it's a racial thing or not,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were unsure who was driving the truck that was  
reported stolen from Lexington County, near Columbia. It was found 
with flattened tires and a shattered windshield, its radio missing, 
Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects were arrested at a home near Andrews, where  
Marshall has relatives. Washington wouldn't say what led 
investigators to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, who lives with his grandmother, could not be located for  
comment and did not return calls Thursday. A sheriff's report said 
his right leg, ankle and arm were injured. He was treated at a 
hospital and released.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Help Older Foster Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation expanding a social program helping  
foster children prepare for independent adulthood appears ready to 
sail through the House with firm Democratic and Republican support, 
a rarity in these partisan times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee voted without dissent Wednesday to  
send the bill to the full House. President Clinton is also an 
enthusiastic backer. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would double current federal grants to states for  
foster programs to a total of $140 million a year to provide job 
training, education, housing aid and counseling in living skills 
for foster children who turn 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``These young people must face the difficult, often scary  
demands of becoming an adult ... all on their own without the 
safety net provided by a family,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, 
R-Conn., the main GOP sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government is the parents,'' said Rep. Ben Cardin, D-Md.  
``How many parents cut off all support to their children when they 
reach 18?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which moves to the full House after the committee's  
voice vote approval, would help an estimated 20,000 people who 
leave the foster system each year, according to the Clinton 
administration. They would be eligible for the aid until age 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we have a responsibility to ensure that these young  
people have the tools they need to make the most of their lives,'' 
Clinton said in written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif., wanted to make the former  
foster children eligible for mandatory coverage under Medicaid, the 
state-federal health insurance program, at a cost of $400 million 
over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	But an amendment by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill  
Archer, R-Texas, made the coverage strictly optional for the 
states. Archer noted that Stark's proposal was not paid for, and 
that states opposed the move as an unwarranted federal mandate on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Even using the optional Medicaid coverage, Johnson said states  
project coverage for about half the young people leaving the foster 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is fully paid for by a variety of financing mechanisms,  
one of which is also drawing some opposition. The bill would 
eliminate a law requiring that the federal government provide as 
much funding to states for child support collection programs as 
they did in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jerry Kleczka, D-Wis., said this would ``penalize'' many  
states, but he agreed to withdraw his amendment to restore the law 
after bill sponsors said it would cost too much at some $60 million 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would do two other things:  
</P>
<P>
	--Allow Filipinos who served in the U.S. Armed Forces during  
World War II and now live in the Philippines to receive 
Supplemental Security Income equal to 75 percent of what they would 
get if they lived in the United States. To qualify, the veteran had 
to be serving in the armed forces before Dec. 31, 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ensure that Indian tribes are consulted by states about the  
particular needs of their foster children for the expanded programs 
and allow them to spend unobligated welfare funds without approval 
by states. 
</P>
<P>
                            *----------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1802.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Fear Backlash on Spy Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With headlines in bold black, red and blue  
characters, Chinese newspapers stacked at Chinatown newsstands on 
Wednesday filled their front pages with the allegations China stole 
U.S. weapons secrets. Their editorials asked skeptically: Where's 
the evidence? 
</P>
<P>
	Many Chinese-Americans feared the coverage of the congressional  
report on Chinese espionage would fuel a backlash against them. But 
some recent immigrants admitted they haven't followed the story, 
too busy in the daily scramble to earn a living in their new 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``This spy issue, it's only something we might think about after  
we're done working, eating our dinner and drinking our tea,'' 
electrician Wang Pian said, amid the clacking of retirees stirring 
mahjong tiles on nearby picnic tables in Chinatown's Columbus Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The espionage report released Tuesday is just the latest in a  
series of U.S.-China irritations that has included this month's 
accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia as well as 
allegations that China illegally provided money to the Democratic 
Party fundraisers. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two U.S.-printed Chinese newspapers paired their  
front-page espionage stories with reports about China's dismissal 
of the allegations as ``baseless accusations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A writer in the Ming Pao Daily News sided with Beijing in an  
editorial, ``The Cox report lacks solid evidence.'' The piece 
criticized the report -- compiled by a special congressional 
committee chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif. -- for not 
naming names and lacking sufficient proof. The document was based 
on a longer classified report. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Beijing-funded China Press, an editorial -- ``Who exactly  
stole who's secrets?'' -- also expressed dismay that more details 
about how China stole secrets were not disclosed in the Cox report, 
which claims the theft occurred over 20 years at U.S. weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	The editorial said the allegations would cause needless harm to  
Chinese in America, making them targets of suspicion and distrust. 
</P>
<P>
	``We Chinese living in America hope that the defense of this  
nation is impregnable,'' the editorial said. ``We also hope that 
missiles fired by the People's Liberation Army won't land on our 
heads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Chinese worried that the congressional report wasn't making  
the distinction between Chinese-Americans and those who work for 
the Communist government in China. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly, we're in the McCarthy era, where being Chinese  
American was synonymous with treason and espionage,'' L. Ling-chi 
Wang, an ethnic studies professor at the University of California, 
Berkeley, told the San Francisco Examiner. ``That's what the effect 
is. It really is an outrage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The espionage allegations might mean some Chinese scientists  
will be denied promotions or work in this country, said a New York 
research scientist who would only give his surname, Yang. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe most Chinese here love this country. There's a lot  
of freedom,'' said Yang, who moved to New York two years ago from 
China and hopes to become a U.S. citizen. ``Most of us just want to 
live here, make a contribution and be comfortable.''

<HEADLINE> Study Suggests 'Heart' Hospitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A new study says elderly patients who suffer heart  
attacks are more likely to survive if they are taken directly to a 
hospital with more experience in dealing with heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers concluded that up to 5,000 lives per year could  
be saved if such high-volume hospitals were designated as ``heart 
centers'' and ambulances with cardiac patients were directed to 
them, as long as travel time was not increased too much. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by Dr. David Thiemann of Johns Hopkins University  
looked at 98,898 Medicare patients around the country. It was 
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	People taken to hospitals that treated fewer than 1.4 heart  
attack patients per week were 17 percent more likely to die within 
30 days than those taken to hospitals that treated at least 4.4 
cardiac patients per week, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study confirmed previous research that found aggressive  
treatment with aspirin, beta blockers and other drugs accounted for 
about one-third of the improvement in survival rates. Treatment by 
cardiologists instead of other specialists also may improve 
survival slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also confirmed previous research showing the  
availability of invasive procedures such as angiography, 
angioplasty and bypass surgery made no difference. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers could not find other specific factors that would  
account for most of the improvement in survival at high-volume 
hospitals. That suggests it is the overall experience of the 
medical staff -- in small ways that aren't easily be measured -- that 
prevents deaths, the study's authors concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in an accompanying editorial, Edward Hannan of the  
University of Albany School of Public Health cautioned that before 
changing ambulance policies, public health officials should look at 
survival rates at individual hospitals, not just the number of 
patients taken there. 
</P>
<P>
	He also cautioned that it is still unclear why some hospitals  
are more successful than others. He also noted the study may simply 
reflect the fact that good hospitals already get more heart attack 
patients because their reputations lead ambulance companies to 
bring people there.

<HEADLINE> WWII Relic Returned To Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A small bell recovered by an American  
soldier in a bombed-out church in Italy in 1944 journeyed home 
today to mark the 55th anniversary of a village's liberation during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am just so elated that it's going back,'' said 84-year-old  
Herbert Roth. 
</P>
<P>
	He grabbed the 9-inch-tall bronze bell as a war memento during  
an Allied offensive in Anzio, a Mediterranean village where nearly 
50,000 soldiers were killed in one of the most ferocious encounters 
of the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I took that bell, it was in a heap of rubble and I  
thought to myself, `How can I leave it because what a reminder of 
World War II that was to me?' Far did I ever know what that bell 
was or what it meant to Italy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bell was used for calling people into Mass at Saints Pio and  
Antonio Catholic Church. On its side is the protruding figure of a 
lion's head, a papal symbol marking the church's founding in 1856. 
</P>
<P>
	After keeping it on a shelf at home for a half-century, Roth  
donated it in 1997 to the Italian American Community Center in 
Gates, a Rochester suburb. The Anzio Beach Museum asked for its 
return and the community center agreed in January.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Warn of Chinese Backlash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chief author of the House report detailing  
alleged Chinese espionage and the House's only Chinese-American 
lawmaker joined Thursday in urging Americans not to use the case as 
a reason to discriminate against Chinese and other Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is just as anti-American to be racist as it is to commit  
espionage,'' said Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., whose special 
panel this week issued a report describing several decades of 
Chinese efforts to obtain and steal U.S. nuclear weapons secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox backed a resolution introduced by Rep. David Wu, D-Ore., the  
House's first Chinese-American, stating that it was wrong for 
Congress and Americans to stereotype people based on the actions of 
any individual. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be sure that no one is unfairly vilified'' as a  
result of the charges against the Chinese government and the 
suspicions that a Chinese-American scientist at the Los Alamos 
nuclear weapons laboratory supplied China with nuclear secrets, Wu 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wu co-sponsored the measure with Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif.,  
who said Chinese-Americans in his Silicon Valley district are 
keeping a low profile for fear of retribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the House Democratic whip, said  
his office was receiving a disturbing number of anti-Asian phone 
calls, a trend that ``must be tackled and nipped at the bud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Patsy Mink, D-Hawaii, an American of Japanese descent, said  
other Chinese-Americans in top security jobs are ``expressing 
extreme discomfort in the way they are being treated'' because of 
the Chinese spying case. 
</P>
<P>
	Since charges arose that the Chinese tried to make illegal  
contributions to President Clinton's re-election campaign, she 
said, her office has received harassing phone calls when she speaks 
on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox accused the Beijing government of enflaming tensions between  
the Chinese and American people with propaganda saying the 
espionage charges were based on anti-Chinese racism. ``It is a 
horrible thing for the Chinese government to whip up.''

<HEADLINE>  Katz Works To Rebuild ABC Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Howard Katz is rebuilding ABC Sports. It's nothing compared to  
what Sean McManus had to deal with when he took over at CBS three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Although ABC is struggling to re-establish its sports identity  
after being thought of as an extension of fellow Disney-owned ESPN, 
Katz has far more to work with than McManus did. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, ABC has ``Monday Night Football,'' the top-rated  
show on the network. It also has the Triple Crown, the top college 
football bowl games and a solid golf package. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely see some similarities there between the two  
situations,'' said Jim Spence, who worked for ABC for 25 years and 
runs a consulting agency. ``The image at CBS was pretty low, 
probably even lower than what ABC's is right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katz's first order of business since being hired as president of  
the sports division in March -- after ordering the walls at ABC to 
be painted -- was to secure a five-year deal with the Indianapolis 
500 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	With Indy's plummeting ratings, it may not seem like a big deal.  
But the network could not afford to lose a race with such 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indy is symbolically important for the network,'' Spence said.  
``Plus, my feeling is that there is going to be a settlement 
between the IRL and CART ... and I think Indy will become Indy 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two racing circuits have begun talks about a possible merger  
after four years of feuding. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up for Katz is the Triple Crown. ABC's deal expires after  
the Belmont Stakes on June 5 and the bidding figures to be far more 
competitive than for Indy. Fox, NBC and CBS should all be in the 
mix. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though CBS may be interested in landing the horse  
racing package, it is not such a necessity these days. 
</P>
<P>
	When McManus took over at CBS in December 1996, the network was  
in disarray. His priority was to reacquire the NFL, which he did a 
year later. Then he made certain to extend CBS' PGA coverage, U.S. 
Open tennis and Big Ten and SEC basketball packages. He also 
broadened the network's NASCAR coverage and locked up high-quality 
talents Jim Nantz and Phil Simms. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, less than three years later, CBS' sports division is among  
the elite. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz's challenge is to do the same.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to be able to restore ABC Sports to the level it once  
had,'' Katz said. ``One of my goals is to give a lift in morale 
around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the ways to keep employees' spirits high and restore the  
ABC tradition is to try to keep from being perceived as ``ESPN3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another would be to take advantage of the current dispute  
between Major League Baseball and ESPN, and pick up the baseball 
package if it becomes available. 
</P>

	The Astros are vacating the Astrodome after this season for a  
new retractable-roof $265 million palace downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just thought that would be a nice touch since that's how  
the Astrodome was originally opened,'' Bob McClaren, the Astros' 
senior vice president, said. ``That's when Mickey Mantle hit the 
first home run in the Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought the New York Yankees would be an appropriate team  
to play as an exhibition game.''

	McClaren said the discussions are with Brian Cashman, the  
Yankees' general manager and with the approval of New York owner 
George Steinbrenner.

<P>
	``Brian has explained the relationship between George  
Steinbrenner and (Astros owner) Drayton McLane is very strong,'' 
McClaren said. ``I know George would like to do this. So we are 
trying to make it all happen.''

<HEADLINE>  Katz Works To Rebuild ABC Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Howard Katz is rebuilding ABC Sports. It's nothing compared to  
what Sean McManus had to deal with when he took over at CBS three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Although ABC is struggling to re-establish its sports identity  
after being thought of as an extension of fellow Disney-owned ESPN, 
Katz has far more to work with than McManus did. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, ABC has ``Monday Night Football,'' the top-rated  
show on the network. It also has the Triple Crown, the top college 
football bowl games and a solid golf package. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely see some similarities there between the two  
situations,'' said Jim Spence, who worked for ABC for 25 years and 
runs a consulting agency. ``The image at CBS was pretty low, 
probably even lower than what ABC's is right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katz's first order of business since being hired as president of  
the sports division in March -- after ordering the walls at ABC to 
be painted -- was to secure a five-year deal with the Indianapolis 
500 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	With Indy's plummeting ratings, it may not seem like a big deal.  
But the network could not afford to lose a race with such 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indy is symbolically important for the network,'' Spence said.  
``Plus, my feeling is that there is going to be a settlement 
between the IRL and CART ... and I think Indy will become Indy 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two racing circuits have begun talks about a possible merger  
after four years of feuding. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up for Katz is the Triple Crown. ABC's deal expires after  
the Belmont Stakes on June 5 and the bidding figures to be far more 
competitive than for Indy. Fox, NBC and CBS should all be in the 
mix. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though CBS may be interested in landing the horse  
racing package, it is not such a necessity these days. 
</P>
<P>
	When McManus took over at CBS in December 1996, the network was  
in disarray. His priority was to reacquire the NFL, which he did a 
year later. Then he made certain to extend CBS' PGA coverage, U.S. 
Open tennis and Big Ten and SEC basketball packages. He also 
broadened the network's NASCAR coverage and locked up high-quality 
talents Jim Nantz and Phil Simms. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, less than three years later, CBS' sports division is among  
the elite. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz's challenge is to do the same.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to be able to restore ABC Sports to the level it once  
had,'' Katz said. ``One of my goals is to give a lift in morale 
around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the ways to keep employees' spirits high and restore the  
ABC tradition is to try to keep from being perceived as ``ESPN3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another would be to take advantage of the current dispute  
between Major League Baseball and ESPN, and pick up the baseball 
package if it becomes available. 
</P>

	Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts also inquired  
about him -- not for a job as coach but as the New York Knicks' 
general manager to replace the fired Ernie Grunfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers, who played for the Knicks when coach Jeff Van Gundy was  
an assistant, would be interested in the GM job -- but he'd rather 
coach. Rivers interviewed for the Washington job and has been 
mentioned for the Orlando position.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Names Foreign Aid Plan Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla.(AP) -- J. Brady Anderson, a former U.S. Ambassador to  
Tanzania, has been tapped by President Clinton to head the U.S. 
Agency for International Development, which manages foreign aid 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Thursday that he would nominate Anderson, a lawyer  
from Charleston, S.C., to the post. He succeeds J. Brian Atwood, 
who held the post for the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady was ambassador to Tanzania from 1994 to 1997. Prior to  
joining the diplomatic corps, Anderson lived in Kenya, Ethiopia and 
Tanzania researching African languages. He speaks Swahili. 
</P>
<P>
	A Vietnam veteran, Anderson worked as an Arkansas assistant  
attorney general, an adviser to then Governor Clinton and a senior 
law clerk to a federal judge in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Atwood withdrew his nomination to become ambassador  
to Brazil, saying opposition by Sen. Jesse Helms ruled out the 
possibility of Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood said Helms, R-N.C., who chairs the Senate Foreign  
Relations Committee, opposed the nomination because of his 
successful campaign to defeat the senator's proposal to merge USAID 
into the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	When he leaves his USAID post, Atwood will remain in charge of  
coordinating the president's humanitarian relief program for 
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Husband Arrested in Wife's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YUTAN, Neb. (AP) -- Four days after a popular teacher and  
volleyball coach died in what looked like a fiery auto wreck, her 
husband was arrested at the cemetery in front of friends and family 
and booked on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe that Mark Schnabel, 43, bludgeoned his wife, then  
crashed her minivan at their farm, put her under the wheels, and 
set the vehicle on fire to make it look like a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnabel, a landscape designer, was arrested Wednesday and  
jailed on $500,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of his wife, Sandy Schnabel, was found early Saturday  
morning under the burned and wrecked minivan. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Tom Jaudzemis said Thursday that the couple had been  
having marital and financial difficulties and that Schnabel had 
taken a $200,000 life insurance policy out on his wife about a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Schnabel, 40, taught business and computer courses for 12  
years at Yutan High School. She also coached varsity volleyball. 
Her teams won a state championship in 1992 and competed in the 
tournament seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a great lady,'' said Deb Wagner, computer coordinator  
at the school. ``She never had anything bad to say about anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Schnabel's students and the couple's three children were  
among the roughly 1,000 people who attended the funeral. It was 
after the burial service that Schnabel was led away in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities initially attributed Mrs. Schnabel's death to a  
traffic accident, but within hours began suspecting foul play. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in this farm community of 1,400 were surprised by the  
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until this morning, I thought Mark was innocent, and I  
still don't know,'' said Yutan High School Superintendent Kevin 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaudzemis said he believes Schnabel beat his wife, then drove  
the minivan through two barbed-wire fences and a cornfield and 
crashed it into a shed. The vehicle and the shed were then set 
ablaze, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She may have been alive when placed under that van and died of  
burns,'' the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two passersby spotted the fire about 1 a.m. and said they  
awakened Schnabel, who called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnabel's attorney, Chuck Forrest, said his client is innocent  
and was in bed after last seeing his wife at 10 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jaudzemis said it is unlikely Schnabel could have slept  
through the crash and the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Schnabel's skull had been fractured and she had broken  
ribs. During a search Wednesday of the couple's farm, blood was 
found spattered on the walls and ceiling, and a vehicle owned by 
Schnabel had blood in it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schnabels' three children, ages 4, 6 and 9, are staying with  
their grandparents. The couple had been married since 1986.

<TEXT>
<P>
	RAPALLO, Italy (AP) -- Richard Virenque beat Santiago Blanco in a  
two-way sprint Thursday to capture the 13th stage of the Tour of 
Italy -- his first win in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The French cyclist, at the center of last year's Tour of France  
doping scandal, outsprinted the Spaniard at the finish line in this 
Italian riviera resort following a long-lasting breakaway. 
</P>
<P>

34 seconds behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Jalabert, who clinched the race leadership last Sunday, held a  
four-seconds lead over defending Giro champion Marco Pantani. 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque completed the spill-marred 150.6-mile distance from  
Sassuolo to Rapallo in 6 hours, 55 minutes, 34 seconds.

<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- When it comes to changing tires and putting  
fuel in the tank, nobody does it better than Davey Hamilton's guys. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galles Racing pit crew changed four tires and simulated a  
refueling in 12.680 seconds Thursday, beating Kenny Brack's team in 
the Carburetion Day pit stop contest at the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the second-fastest time in the 23-year history of the  
competition. Danny Sullivan's crew won in 11.742 seconds in 1985 -- 
the same year Sullivan won the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack's crew, from A.J. Foyt Racing, finished in 14.560.  
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are great, they never give up,'' said Hamilton, who  
will start in the fourth row Sunday. ``I hope this race comes down 
to the last pit stop because they'll win it for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the sixth time a crew from Galles Racing has won the  
contest, tying Team Penske for most victories in the competition. 
The team also won in 1989, 1990, 1993, 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The team won $37,500, and Hamilton and chief mechanic Darren  
Russell said the money will be donated to Spinal Conquest, a 
foundation to cure paralysis. The foundation is the team's primary 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Carburetion Day is a longtime tradition at the Indianapolis  
Motor Speedway, even though carburetors haven't been used at Indy 
for years. Drivers get two hours to test their cars and practice in 
traffic with full loads of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The cars don't go back on the track until they are wheeled out  
of Gasoline Alley on Sunday morning to line up for the start of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ALL CLEAR:* John Paul Jr. will be Tony Stewart's backup after  
track doctors gave him the OK Thursday to drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul severely bruised and strained his back last Friday when he  
spun in turn three and hit the wall before sliding into the infield 
grass. Dave Steele, who sustained a concussion and strained his 
back in a May 19 crash, also was cleared to drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul, whose best finish at Indianapolis was seventh last year,  
is ready in case something goes wrong with Stewart's attempt to 
drive two races Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who won the Indy Racing League title two years ago, is  
trying to become the first driver to complete the Indianapolis 500 
and the Coca-Cola 600 in Concord, N.C. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	 *KING FOR A DAY:* A tie is too boring, a pen set too practical  
and a gold watch too common for Arie Luyendyk's retirement gift. 
</P>
<P>
	So, what's a mayor to do? Give ``The Flying Dutchman'' his own  
day, of course. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith proclaimed Thursday ``Arie  
Luyendyk Day'' to honor the two-time Indy winner. Luyendyk, who 
will start on the pole, is retiring after Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk got a key to the city and a proclamation in a ceremony  
after Carburetion Day practice.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Farmer Union Vote Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALINAS, Calif. (AP) -- The United Farm Workers, struggling to  
regain the clout it had under Cesar Chavez, was dealt a tremendous 
setback when California strawberry pickers voted to join an upstart 
committee that has never negotiated a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the results are not official and the UFW can still  
force a runoff, the election this week was widely seen as another 
sign of the union's failure to recover from years of decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``The UFW made a lot of mistakes here,'' said John Borrego,  
associate professor of community studies at University of 
California, Santa Cruz, who follows the agricultural labor 
movement. ``This should send them the message that they have to 
change their strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,300 pickers working for Coastal Berry, the nation's  
largest strawberry grower, voted Tuesday and Wednesday, in favor of 
being represented by the Coastal Berry of California Farm Worker 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	State labor officials have yet to finalize the 646-577 vote.  
About 60 ballots are in dispute, and another 79 workers voted for a 
third option of no union, meaning that neither the UFW nor the 
novice committee has obtained the majority support necessary for 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW cannot win, said the state Agricultural Labor Relations  
Board, though it still could force a runoff if the Farm Worker 
Committee does not receive enough of the remaining votes. 
</P>
<P>
	UFW president Arturo Rodriguez said he was saddened by their  
loss to the upstart union. He blamed interference by antiunion 
growers who feared a victory at Coastal Berry might spread to other 
berry fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their organization has nothing to offer, while we have  
demonstrated and proven results,'' he said. ``Clearly there was 
intimidation and coercion here, and we're going to continue our 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results were considered pivotal in the UFW's effort to  
recover from the years of decline that came even before the 1993 
death of its legendary founder, Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Chavez, 80,000 farmworkers were working under UFW  
contracts by 1970. Union membership had dwindled to 20,000 at the 
time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the UFW tried to kindle a resurgence in the state's  
$600 million, 20,000 worker strawberry industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But outside observers said the UFW made mistakes, including  
replacing about 10 local organizers with out-of-town professionals, 
and underestimating the tight relationship pickers had with 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were tremendous accusations when the UFW started  
organizing here that they were acting like bullies and they were 
telling these fiercely independent people that they should turn to 
them for support and give them part of their paycheck,'' said 
Borrego. ``This generation of workers hasn't even heard of Cesar 
Chavez. They don't bring with them a history that unions are 
wonderful things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result came as no surprise to Jess Brown, executive director  
of the Santa Cruz County Farm Bureau. He said the worker's choice 
is a sign of the UFW's weakness in the community. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union wasn't able to clearly show that it could do more  
than what the workers presently have or could have,'' he said. 
``The UFW didn't do their research. They thought this was something 
they could easily attain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Harley Shaiken, an industrial relations professor at  
UC-Berkeley, said the close vote suggests the UFW remains a force 
to be reckoned with in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be easy to say they had the election, the UFW lost,  
end of story. But it's more interesting that under circumstances 
that have been very difficult, the union has come very close to 
victory at a pivotal company,'' Shaiken said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Berry Co. President Ernie Farley, who has repeatedly  
asserted his neutrality, said his company will ``abide by whatever 
representing body the state labor board certifies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Jim Gumberg, who represents the Coastal Berry of  
California Farm Worker Committee, said his group has no president 
and is led by a vice president -- Sergio Leal -- who was fired by 
Coastal Berry for alleged misconduct. He said he isn't sure whether 
they have obtained Labor Department recognition as a union, and he 
said none of them has negotiated a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Workers weren't voting for our agenda here,'' he said. ``They  
were voting against the UFW with its slick organizers who threaten, 
cajole, intimidate, and have never picked a berry in their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ALRB officials planned to meet Thursday to discuss the  
unresolved ballots, said the board's regional director, Fred 
Capuyan. He would not speculate on how long it would take to 
determine a winner.

<HEADLINE> AL Suspends Ramirez, Nitkowski </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cleveland outfielder Manny Ramirez and Detroit  
pitcher C.J. Nitkowski, the two players ejected during last week's 
beanball battle at Jacobs Field, were suspended and fined Thursday 
by AL president Gene Budig. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, leading the majors with 59 RBIs, is to start a  
three-game suspension Friday against Boston. Nitkowski is to begin 
a two-game suspension Friday against Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on whether either player would  
appeal the penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Jaret Wright of Cleveland and manager Larry Parrish and  
pitcher Jeff Weaver of Detroit also were fined undisclosed amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	And in an unusual step, Budig announced his intention to talk to  
Wright and Indians manager Mike Hargrove about Wright's 
``deportment on the mound'' when Cleveland visits New York next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us wants to see Jaret told how to pitch,'' Indians  
general manager John Hart said. ``He pitches inside and will 
continue to so do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble at Jacobs Field last Saturday began when Wright --  
suspended for five games in April and fined $1,000 after hitting a 
Boston batter with a pitch following a home run -- nailed Detroit's 
Tony Clark in the batting helmet with a fastball in the top of the 
sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	In the bottom of the sixth, Ramirez charged Weaver after being  
hit in the helmet with a pitch, setting off a bench-clearing brawl. 
During the fracas, Parrish wrestled down Wright from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams were warned against further trouble. In the eighth,  
Nitkowski was ejected when his first -- and only -- pitch knocked 
Kenny Lofton to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American League this year has suspended only players who  
were ejected by umpires,'' Budig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish said he had not expected a fine, but ``I don't know that  
it's anything I'd fight, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Nitkowski, he said, ``He's the one suspended who wasn't  
throwing at anybody, for sure. But it happened after he'd been 
warned.''

	Ramirez is batting .348 with 13 home runs.

	``I think in Manny's case, obviously Manny was hit

	``If I get two, how come Ramirez only gets three? I think that's

In our situation, all you can do is grind your teeth. I don't think 
it was overly fair,'' he said.

	Hart also spoke to Budig about Parrish's involvement in the  
brawl ``and I told him I didn't think that was appropriate.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Finishes N. Korea Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. technical experts have completed an  
inspection of a suspected nuclear weapons development site in North 
Korea, and their findings will be subjected to careful analysis, 
the State Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman James P. Rubin said the U.S. team found ``an  
unfinished site, the underground portion of which was an extensive, 
empty tunnel.'' No judgments about the inspection will be made 
before the analysis is completed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team began its inspection on May 20 and finished on May 24,  
earlier than expected. It credited North Korean officials with 
allowing unhampered access to the site and rapid completion of the 
work plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Satellite photos taken last year led some U.S. experts to  
believe the North Koreans were using the site to develop nuclear 
weapons in violation of a 1994 agreement between the two countries. 
North Korea denied any such intention. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the U.S. team will make a return visit in May 2000,  
in accordance with an agreement reached in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The team completed its work shortly before the arrival in  
Pyongyang of former Defense Secretary William Perry, who is 
reviewing U.S. policy toward North Korea for President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports that Perry planned to meet with North Korean  
leader Kim Jong-il. Rubin said he was unaware whether any such 
meeting had taken place. Perry carried a letter from Clinton for 
Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry planned to leave North Korea on Friday and to brief  
Japanese and South Korean officials in Seoul on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> NFL Commits Stadium Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The NFL is using its financial clout to put an  
end to franchise free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a new financial policy approved at the March meetings, the  
league committed more than $200 million Wednesday to help three of 
its bedrock franchises -- New England, Philadelphia and Denver -- 
build new stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy was put into place as one way of solving the  
franchise movement that reached its peak four years ago when the 
Rams and Raiders deserted Los Angeles, the Browns left Cleveland 
and the Oilers left Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The league has expanded to Cleveland and is working on putting a  
new team in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a crucial policy for the league to have strong footing in  
the largest media markets,'' said Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey 
Lurie, one of the beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy allows backing of up to 50 percent of private  
financing used for stadiums in the top six markets and 34 percent 
in those below that level. 
</P>
<P>
	New England and Philadelphia are in the first group and Denver  
in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos owner Patrick Bowlen said he expects a commitment of $43  
million to $44 million, and the Eagles expect close to $50 million 
to $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots, recommitted to Massachusetts after a withdrawing a  
plan to move to Hartford, Conn., could get more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	All three already have various commitments for public financing.  
</P>
<P>
	In other action on the final day of the league's spring meeting:  
</P>
<P>
	--The owners rejected a proposal to move kickoffs from the 30- to  
the 25-yard line to encourage returns. That first came up in March 
and was tabled, but proponents were still unable to get a 
consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	--The owners awarded the 2003 Super Bowl to San Diego, replacing  
San Francisco, which will not have a new stadium ready. South 
Florida was the only other contender. 
</P>
<P>
	--The league unveiled the technology for its new replay system,  
to be reinstated this fall after seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	--The owners extended NFL Europe for at least another season.  
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest impact long term is the commitment to financing  
both new stadiums and stadium improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	For while the money is more collateral than loan, it will allow  
the teams involved to get a commitment for funds to build stadiums 
and to get them at lower interest rates than they might have. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also not likely to cost the teams involved. Money will be  
paid back from club seat revenues that go to visiting teams, which 
get 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In part, it's a continuation of a league policy. But never  
before has the NFL backed as much as half the building cost. 
Thirty-four percent was the most committed in the past, and most of 
that was for renovations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an evolutionary thing not a new thing,'' commissioner  
Paul Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't sit well with everyone.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tax on all the teams that won't benefit,'' said Al  
Davis of the Raiders. ``Never before in the history of the league 
have the poor given to the rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who recently withdrew from a  
$380 million stadium deal in Connecticut and now has $70 million in 
state money from Massachusetts to help build roads around his new 
stadium, suggested it was simply a case of partners helping each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	``Helping each other is one way to get things done,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On replay, the owners were shown the technology in which coaches  
will get two challenges a game, plus an unlimited number in the 
last two minutes of each half. The calls will be made by a replay 
official from a stadium booth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a system designed to correct a mistake that the whole  
world knows is a mistake,'' said Dennis Lewin, the league's top 
television official.

<HEADLINE> IBM Exec Claims Microsoft Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- During one of the lowest points of the  
soured relationship between two of the computer industry's giants, 
Microsoft offered an alliance with IBM if it agreed to sacrifice 
its rival operating-system software, an IBM manager told lawyers 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that in a meeting during a trade show in Las Vegas with  
top Microsoft executives -- including Bill Gates -- IBM rejected the 
overture and said it planned to sell both Windows and its own OS/2 
operating system, which ultimately proved a commercial failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Garry Norris, the IBM manager who will be one of the  
government's final witnesses in its antitrust trial with Microsoft, 
contended in sworn testimony Thursday that Microsoft exerted 
pressure on IBM to cut its sales of OS/2, the software product that 
competed directly with Windows until the popularity of OS/2 waned 
in late 1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He also testified that major computer makers, such as Compaq  
Computer Corp., agreed not to sell OS/2 on their machines because 
of threats from Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said a Compaq executive told him Microsoft had promised  
in 1993 ``to make it difficult for Compaq'' if it sold IBM's 
product, and he revealed that IBM complained about the alleged 
threats to the Justice Department as early as 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, who works for IBM at nearby Research Triangle Park, will  
be the government's second witness during the rebuttal phase of the 
trial, which resumes Tuesday in Washington after a 13-week recess. 
A Microsoft lawyer, Rick Pepperman, questioned Norris in North 
Carolina about his expected testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said that after IBM rejected Microsoft's alleged offer in  
1994, Microsoft took an unusually tough stance negotiating the 
wholesale price that IBM paid to put Windows on computers it sold 
to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said that weeks before the August 1995 rollout of an  
important new version of Windows, Microsoft threatened to end 
negotiations, which were at a standstill. The companies finally 
reached an agreed price, ``15 minutes before the launch of Windows 
95,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM had paid only $9 for earlier versions of Windows, what it  
believed to be the lowest price paid by any company. But Microsoft 
wanted about $46 for Windows 95 -- much more than IBM believed some 
other computer makers were paying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft told us repeatedly, `Because you compete with us,  
you're going to get unfavorable terms and conditions,''' Norris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said IBM's costs rose from $40 million to $220 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Although the exact price that Microsoft charges for Windows is  
one of the industry's most closely guarded secrets, previous 
testimony indicated that favored companies, such as Compaq Computer 
Corp., generally pay less than IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told they (Compaq) received that deduction because they  
didn't compete with Microsoft,'' Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends that Compaq received lower prices because it  
qualified for some volume discounts and because Compaq helped 
develop some important technology that was incorporated into 
Windows 95. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its antitrust case, the government alleges that  
Microsoft bullies the nation's computer manufacturers. Lawyers say 
it uses prices to punish its enemies and reward its friends, and to 
stem potential competition among operating system software, 
Microsoft's most lucrative franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers indicate Norris will testify at the trial about the  
threats Microsoft allegedly made over IBM's support of OS/2 and 
Internet browser software from Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris' deposition was the second of three scheduled this week.  
The government will depose a Microsoft witness, software executive 
Gordon Eubanks, on Friday in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters are allowed to attend the depositions under a 1913 law  
covering antitrust depositions, which are normally conducted in 
private.

<HEADLINE> Russians Angered by Serb Indictment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia responded angrily Thursday to the war  
crimes indictment of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, saying 
it would damage efforts to find a political solution to the Kosovo 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment came after Russia's special envoy on Kosovo,  
Viktor Chernomyrdin, concluded two days of talks with U.S. Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Finnish President Martti 
Ahtisaari. 
</P>
<P>
	After the talks ended inconclusively, Chernomyrdin was scheduled  
to fly to Yugoslavia Friday for meetings with Milosevic, according 
to his spokesman, Valentin Sergeyev. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we reached the finish line in the negotiating process.  
But somebody needed to put obstacles on the road to a peaceful 
dialogue,'' Chernomyrdin said in response to the indictment, 
according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, which opposes NATO airstrikes and has been participating  
in negotiations to end the war in Yugoslavia, said indicting the 
Yugoslav leader would make solving the crisis difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're dealing with Yugoslavia, you have to deal with one  
person -- the president of Yugoslavia,'' said Dmitry Yakushkin, a 
spokesman for President Boris Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, Thursday  
indicted Milosevic and four top aides on charges of planning and 
carrying out war crimes against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Foreign Ministry said the indictment had been  
``purely politically motivated'' and questioned why the tribunal 
had not investigated NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hardly consider it incidental that this step was undertaken  
at the moment when the talks to solve the Kosovo problem entered 
the most important stage,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dmitri Ryurikov, an international affairs adviser to the upper  
house of parliament, told the ITAR-Tass news agency the indictment 
was ``absolutely groundless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence whatsoever that he is to blame for what  
he is charged with,'' Ryurikov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribunal chief prosecutor Louise Arbour in The Hague insisted  
she had done the right thing, saying the indictment ``will make a 
major contribution to a lasting peace, not only in Kosovo, but in 
the whole region in which we have jurisdiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Chernomyrdin, Talbott and Ahtisaari left  
Thursday for Bonn, Germany, for talks with German Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeyev said the three would meet again within the next few  
days, but a date or place had not been determined, the ITAR-Tass 
news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	German leaders signaled Thursday that peace talks could continue  
with Milosevic despite the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``To achieve peace, I'd even shake hands with the devil. That's  
the task of a foreign minister,'' Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer 
said on ZDF television. Diplomatic efforts should be strengthened 
``entirely independently from how a court decides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder took a similar stand after meeting  
with Talbott and Ahtisaari. ``Sometimes there are goals -- such as 
peace in Europe -- that take precedence over other considerations,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE>  Lawmakers Hear Diverse Gun Views </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two parents whose children were slain by  
classmates gave lawmakers diverse views Thursday on whether the 
slayers, guns or lawmakers themselves are to blame for their 
tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Scott of Littleton, Colo., told the House Judiciary  
Committee's subcommittee that he blames the April 20 death of his 
daughter, Rachel Joy Scott, 17, on Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people behind those instruments of death,'' Scott  
told the panel. ``I do believe Eric and Dylan bear primary 
responsibility for my daughter's death, not the guns themselves.'' 
.
</P>
<P>
	But Byrl Phillips-Taylor of Richmond, Va., placed the blamed an  
AK47 for her son's 1989 death at the hands of a ``classmate with a 
grudge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The easy availability of guns got my baby killed,''  
Phillips-Taylor told the panel, urging lawmakers to pass the 
mandatory background checks for gun show transactions and other new 
firearms restrictions voted by the Senate last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate has demonstrated that it cares about keeping guns  
away from children,'' she said. ``And that may be the turning point 
that every mother like me has been waiting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders this week said they support the concept  
of the gun restrictions passed by the Senate, but they rejected 
demands from Democrats to quickly rubber-stamp the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, who has co-authored gun  
control bills in the past, said careful consideration of the 
legislation next month would ensure that new controls would not 
infringe on the Second Amendment right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans at Thursday's hearing criticized the Clinton  
administration as failing to prosecute violators of existing 
firearms laws while pushing for more gun restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., suggested that if the Ten Commandments had  
been posted at high schools where the shooting occurred, ``we would 
not have had the tragedies that bring us here today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Replied Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr.: ``If the young  
people and adult criminals who committed these crimes had a tougher 
time getting their hands on guns, these horrible crimes might have 
been prevented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, who broke a 50-50 Senate tie last week  
in favor of the new gun show restrictions, returned to the Capitol 
Thursday to accuse House Republicans of trying to please the 
National Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this very moment, there are some of the other side meeting  
behind closed doors plotting to have more delays in order to 
preserve loopholes'' in firearms law, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre told the House  
subcommittee Thursday that the Senate bill was a ``red tape 
nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically it would extend the reaches of the federal  
government into the homes of this country,'' LaPierre said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the NRA supports mandatory gun show background checks  
and other concepts in the Senate bill, but not as written. For 
example, he said, the Senate would ``your uncle's skeet-shooting 
range'' as a gun show subject to government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, testifying at the request of committee Republicans,  
supported LaPierre's complaint that some gun control advocates were 
seeking to put the blame for the shootings at the NRA's doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that they are responsible for my daughter's  
death,'' said Scott, who said he was not a member of the group and 
does not own a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott also scolded lawmakers about their eagerness to pass more  
laws despite the cultural causes behind school shootings. 
``Political posturing and restrictive legislation are not the 
answers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Opposes China Trade Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Gary Bauer  
challenged other GOP candidates Thursday to oppose normalized trade 
with China in light of allegations of Chinese spying at U.S. 
nuclear laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most pressing priorities facing the next president  
is the need for a new foreign policy with China, a policy rooted in 
America's vital national interest and basic human rights instead of 
a policy primarily rooted in trade,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is expected to vote next month on whether to extend  
normalized trade relations, formerly called most favored nation 
status, with China. Beijing also is pushing for admission to the 
World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain said this week's spying allegations will not  
change his support for normalized trade relations with China. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we cut off normal trade relations with every nation that  
spies on us, we might be trading with Canada -- and I am not even 
sure about that,'' the Arizona Republican said. ``It's hard for me 
to believe that anyone would be surprised that China is spying on 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, in a news conference Tuesday, said,  
``I still believe it is important for China to open its markets to 
U.S. producers and U.S. products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said U.S. producers should not be punished because of China's  
spying. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole believes China should be admitted to the WTO  
because ``trade is one of the most important tools for forcing 
humanitarian and pro-democratic change,'' said her spokesman Ari 
Fleischer. He said he expected her to support a continuation of 
normalized trade status. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle said in a speech last month  
that China is ``not ready for WTO'' entry and that the United 
States should be wary of renewing China's trade status. His 
spokesman Jonathan Baron said this week's developments have not 
changed Quayle's views. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes adamantly opposes China's entry into the WTO at  
this time, and thinks China's actions threaten its trade status as 
well, according to his spokeswoman Juleanna Glover.

<HEADLINE>  Manchester United's Win for Ages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Manchester United has lifted English soccer back  
to the summit of Europe after a long, hard climb. And with their 
historic triple crown season, the Reds are being hailed as possibly 
the greatest English team ever. 
</P>
<P>
	United etched its place in English soccer folklore by beating  
Bayern Munich 2-1 in Barcelona on Wednesday night to win the 
European Champions Cup -- the world's most prestigious club title. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most dramatic finishes in cup history, United came  
from behind to win with two goals in the final 90 seconds of injury 
time by substitutes Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory completed an unprecedented sweep by an English club  
of the domestic league, F.A. Cup and European Cup titles in the 
same season -- something that even the great Liverpool teams of the 
late 1970s and early '80s never accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	British newspapers hailed the win as one of the greatest moments  
in English soccer history, with the Daily Mirror headline even 
calling it ``The Greatest 2 Minutes in the History of Sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of fans poured into the streets of Manchester to  
celebrate Wednesday night, and the city was turned into a sea of 
red -- the team's color -- Thursday night as men, women and children 
turned out to greet their heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans climbed lamp-posts and any available vantage points along  
the route to get a better view as manager Alex Ferguson and his 
players rode through the city in an open-top double-decker bus. 
</P>
<P>
	It took nearly four hours for the bus to wind its way through  
the masses on its seven-mile route from the outskirts of the city 
to the downtown Manchester indoor arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Car horns, whistles and the ``Glory Glory Man United'' anthem  
filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of the crowd was estimated at anywhere from 400,000 to  
750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson and the players stood atop the bus, waving to the  
crowds and holding up the three trophies. The European Cup was 
propped up front like a huge hood ornament. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the bus neared the city center, the route of the  
parade along the shopping street of Deansgate was packed. So many 
red-shirted supporters were waiting to welcome the team that police 
appealed for fans to stay away from the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson's team became the first United club to lift the  
European trophy since since 1968, when Matt Busby was manager and 
George Best and Bobby Charlton were the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	That triumph came 10 years after the Munich air crash which  
killed eight players of the United team known as the ``Busby 
Babes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a powerful piece of symbolism, United's triumph Wednesday  
came on what would have been Busby's 90th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlton, who survived the Munich crash and is now a senior  
director of the club, wiped away tears as he watched the team's 
celebrations Wednesday night from the stands of the Camp Nou 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also helped erase some of the memories of another  
dark chapter in English soccer history. In 1985, 39 people died 
when English hooligans rioted before the Liverpool-Juventus 
European Cup final at Brussels' Heysel stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy resulted in English clubs being banned from European  
competition for five years. Since the ban was lifted, Manchester 
United (1991), Arsenal (1994) and Chelsea (1998) won the Cup 
Winners Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But, until this season, no English club had managed to progress  
to the Champions Cup final. The win over Bayern means English clubs 
are now tied with Italian sides with the most European Cup 
victories (9).

	``English football has been in the wilderness for a long time  
and now we're back on the world stage,'' Charlton said. ``It's been 
all right saying English football is the healthiest and the best to 
watch, but you really need to have something to show for it and to 
win the Champions League, there's nothing bigger in world club 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Debate is already raging on whether this Manchester United team,  
which has won the Premier League title in five of the past seven 
seasons, is the greatest English club of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparisons are being made to the 1958 and 1968 United teams and  
to the Liverpool teams which won the European Cup four times (1977, 
1978, 1981 and 1984). Bob Paisley was the Liverpool manager during 
that era and his star players included Kenny Dalglish and Graeme 
Souness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always said we would never be judged as a great team until  
we had won the Champions League,'' winger Ryan Giggs said. ``We've 
done that now and I think we deserve to be ranked along with the 
Liverpool teams of the 80s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the credit goes to Ferguson, the 57-year-old Scot whose  
achievements rank alongside those of Paisley, Busby, Bill Shankly 
and Jock Stein. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson has claimed 12 major trophies since taking over at  
United in 1986 -- five league championships, four F.A. Cups, one 
league Cup, one Champions Cup and one Cup Winners Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	That total puts Ferguson only one behind Paisley, who won 13  
trophies at Liverpool. Ferugson also won 10 major trophies with 
Aberdeen, bringing his career total to 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson may soon become ``Sir Alex.'' It's now widely expected  
that he will receive a knighthood -- an honor that also went to 
Busby.

<HEADLINE>  Manchester United's Win for Ages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Manchester United has lifted English soccer back  
to the summit of Europe after a long, hard climb. And with their 
historic triple crown season, the Reds are being hailed as possibly 
the greatest English team ever. 
</P>
<P>
	United etched its place in English soccer folklore by beating  
Bayern Munich 2-1 in Barcelona on Wednesday night to win the 
European Champions Cup -- the world's most prestigious club title. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most dramatic finishes in cup history, United came  
from behind to win with two goals in the final 90 seconds of injury 
time by substitutes Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory completed an unprecedented sweep by an English club  
of the domestic league, F.A. Cup and European Cup titles in the 
same season -- something that even the great Liverpool teams of the 
late 1970s and early '80s never accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	British newspapers hailed the win as one of the greatest moments  
in English soccer history, with the Daily Mirror headline even 
calling it ``The Greatest 2 Minutes in the History of Sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of fans poured into the streets of Manchester to  
celebrate Wednesday night, and the city was turned into a sea of 
red -- the team's color -- Thursday night as men, women and children 
turned out to greet their heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans climbed lamp-posts and any available vantage points along  
the route to get a better view as manager Alex Ferguson and his 
players rode through the city in an open-top double-decker bus. 
</P>
<P>
	It took nearly four hours for the bus to wind its way through  
the masses on its seven-mile route from the outskirts of the city 
to the downtown Manchester indoor arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Car horns, whistles and the ``Glory Glory Man United'' anthem  
filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of the crowd was estimated at anywhere from 400,000 to  
750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson and the players stood atop the bus, waving to the  
crowds and holding up the three trophies. The European Cup was 
propped up front like a huge hood ornament. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the bus neared the city center, the route of the  
parade along the shopping street of Deansgate was packed. So many 
red-shirted supporters were waiting to welcome the team that police 
appealed for fans to stay away from the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson's team became the first United club to lift the  
European trophy since since 1968, when Matt Busby was manager and 
George Best and Bobby Charlton were the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	That triumph came 10 years after the Munich air crash which  
killed eight players of the United team known as the ``Busby 
Babes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a powerful piece of symbolism, United's triumph Wednesday  
came on what would have been Busby's 90th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlton, who survived the Munich crash and is now a senior  
director of the club, wiped away tears as he watched the team's 
celebrations Wednesday night from the stands of the Camp Nou 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also helped erase some of the memories of another  
dark chapter in English soccer history. In 1985, 39 people died 
when English hooligans rioted before the Liverpool-Juventus 
European Cup final at Brussels' Heysel stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy resulted in English clubs being banned from European  
competition for five years. Since the ban was lifted, Manchester 
United (1991), Arsenal (1994) and Chelsea (1998) won the Cup 
Winners Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But, until this season, no English club had managed to progress  
to the Champions Cup final. The win over Bayern means English clubs 
are now tied with Italian sides with the most European Cup 
victories (9). 
</P>
<P>
	``English football has been in the wilderness for a long time  
and now we're back on the world stage,'' Charlton said. ``It's been 
all right saying English football is the healthiest and the best to 
watch, but you really need to have something to show for it and to 
win the Champions League, there's nothing bigger in world club 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Debate is already raging on whether this Manchester United team,  
which has won the Premier League title in five of the past seven 
seasons, is the greatest English club of all time.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Airports Add Heart Devices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The city's two airports will become the first in  
the nation to make life-saving defibrillators available to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	The devices, which restart hearts by delivering a shock, will be  
placed throughout O'Hare International and Midway airports for use 
by any passer-by, city aviation department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, emergency medical technicians responded to 1,680  
cardiac-related calls at O'Hare alone, said Dennis Culloton, a 
spokesman for the city aviation department. 
</P>
<P>
	Most airports have defibrillators available to their employees  
or emergency medical professionals, but they are stored in places 
not accessible to the public, department spokeswoman Monique Bond 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The devices will be spaced no more than one minute's walking  
distance apart, Culloton said. They will be installed on walls in 
public areas in the terminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Randolph Smoak, chairman of the American Medical Association  
Board of Trustees, said having the devices in public places ``has 
some merit.'' But he warned that, without proper training, using 
the devices on someone who is not having a heart attack could be 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials and the device's maker, Seattle-based  
Heartstream, said the shock activates only after the device detects 
that a person's heart is beating irregularly or has stopped. Users 
also will be advised to call the airport's emergency communications 
center on an adjacent phone. 
</P>
<P>
	The defibrillators cost $3,000 each.

<HEADLINE> Study Reveals Staph Vaccine Hopeful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have developed a new vaccine to  
protect against a troublesome staph microbe that commonly infects 
hospital patients and increasingly is becoming resistant to 
antibiotics. Results so far in animal studies are encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, the  
vaccine was able to protect mice and rabbits from lethal doses of 
strains of staphylococcus aureus bacteria that are partially 
resistant to the best drugs available, researchers say. A report on 
the study appears Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers worldwide are scrambling to find new vaccines  
against staph because the common bacterial infection is becoming 
more resistant to drugs such as penicillin. Some strains of staph 
now even are partially resistant to vancomycin, a drug that has 
been the last line of defense against the microbe. 
</P>
<P>
	Staph infections strike a half million American hospital  
patients a year, particularly those having heart valve surgery, 
knee and hip replacement, and kidney failure patients who are on 
dialysis. Outside the hospital, the microbe can cause infections 
ranging from skin abscesses to pneumonia, meningitis, and 
infections of the bone and heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gerald B. Pier, co-author of the Science study, said the  
vaccine he and his colleagues developed is based on a molecule that 
staph makes only when the microbe starts an infection inside the 
body. This molecule, called PNSG, normally is not seen in 
laboratory cultures of staph, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This molecule appears to be critical for infection and disease  
progression,'' Pier said. ``All staph aureus strains that we have 
looked at in the lab, and that's well over 50, have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pier and his co-workers isolated the PNSG molecule from staph  
infection specimens. They then injected purified PNSG into 
laboratory mice and rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
	In all cases, Pier said, the animals developed antibodies that  
reacted powerfully against staph bacteria. He said mice with such 
antibodies were injected with double-lethal doses of staph bacteria 
that was partially resistant to vancomycin. All of the test mice 
survived, he said, but 80 percent or more of the mice not protected 
by PNSG shots died of staph infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Pier said human trials of the PSNG vaccine should start within  
18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	When a staph vaccine is developed, Pier said it probably will be  
used most commonly to protect patients having surgery and people at 
high risk of burns or wounds, such as firemen, policemen and 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pier said it also may be possible to inject healthy people with  
a vaccine and then extract antibodies against staph. These 
antibodies could be injected into accident victims and others 
hospitalized unexpectedly. Such antibodies probably would protect 
against staph infections for up to two weeks, Pier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of  
Allergy and Infections, said the vaccine research was ``a hopeful 
step against a very worrisome pathogen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fauci, in a statement, said that emerging strains of staph that  
are partially resistant to vancomycin are ``most troubling'' and 
that ``new treatments and ... and effective vaccine are urgently 
needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nabi, a drug company in a Boca Raton, Fla., is conducting  
clinical trials of a staph vaccine among 1,800 patients who are on 
dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nabi vaccine is based on molecules that are different from  
the ones in the vaccine under study by Pier and his group. Results 
of Nabi's vaccine study will be announced late next year, company 
official Tanina Frouge said.

<HEADLINE> India Frontier Town Faces Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KARGIL, India (AP) -- They say if you hear the shriek of the  
incoming shell, you're safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Small comfort for Mohammad Saddiq, who squatted against the  
concrete wall of his hotel for protection Thursday in this Indian 
town at the front line of the dispute between India and Pakistan 
over the Kashmir region. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pakistani artillery shell crashed into the ground nearby with  
an earth-shuddering boom, and several pieces of shrapnel landed in 
the courtyard of Saddiq's hotel. A few minutes later, another 
landed, hitting a house 300 feet away with another loud explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I will leave now. This shelling makes you mentally  
tense, mentally sick,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people in this town of 15,000 have already left. Officials  
say 75 percent are gone. More boarded buses Thursday, convinced the 
bombardment will continue for weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian and Pakistani soldiers exchange fire along the disputed  
frontier almost every day and have gone to war over Kashmir twice. 
Tensions escalated Wednesday when India sent warplanes and 
helicopter gunships into the rugged Himalayan region to blast out 
separatist guerrillas encamped in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Kargil, India's northernmost town situated in a fertile valley  
dotted with willow trees, is used to fighting. Shells have landed 
here every year for the last three years. In 1997, 20 people were 
killed. Last year, the town was abandoned under unusually heavy 
shelling. 
</P>
<P>
	Qamar Ali Akhoon, overseeing civilian operations in Kargil, said  
he expected the latest exodus to be almost complete in a few weeks. 
``If the firing continues as it did today, most people will leave 
to safer areas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The town is boarded up tight, padlocked and sealed. Only a few  
shops were open. Men idled in small groups on the main market 
street. Few women were to be seen. When the shelling begins, 
everybody scurries for shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Kargil's worst problem is not shells from Pakistan. It's  
food from India. 
</P>
<P>
	For eight months of the year, the road into town is snowed in.  
Residents survive through the winter on stores from the previous 
autumn, then quickly resupply when the roads open in May. This 
year, escalated fighting has kept the road closed to civilian 
traffic, blocking the long-awaited supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have enough rice, flour and kerosene,'' said Akhoon. ``But  
no vegetables, no meat, no chicken, no eggs, no butter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One truck got through Thursday, attaching itself to an army  
convoy. Citizens pounced on it when it unloaded at a store. Within 
three hours, all the potatoes, cabbage, and watermelon were sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``No convoys have been allowed in. My shop is empty,'' said  
Mohammad Hussain, 40, who owns another grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing to sell, we only have last year's stock,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaleen Kabra, the senior administrator of the district, said he  
was rationing medicines, giving the local hospital just enough for 
two days at a time so they were not squandered. 
</P>
<P>
	Measles has broken out, and doctors were short of antibiotics.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are poor people,'' said Haji Abdul Rehman, a 58-year-old  
farmer. ``Both the countries are fighting, and we are sandwiched 
between them.''

	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A Delta Air Lines flight turned around shortly  
after takeoff Thursday after a baggage handler was discovered 
accidentally locked in the cargo bin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-bound flight returned to Cleveland Hopkins

<P>
	Emergency workers met the plane as it landed and examined the

heated. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Montana Speed Limit To Go in Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- The American autobahn is gone.  
</P>
<P>
	Montana's freewheeling status as the only state without a  
daytime speed limit evaporated a half-hour before sunrise Friday. 
Now the state's top speed is 75 mph on interstates, day or night. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law takes effect on the eve of the Memorial Day weekend,  
3 1/2 years since Congress repealed the federal speed limits and the 
signs came down along Montana's highways. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when Montana began operating under the so-called ``basic  
rule,'' a law requiring motorists to drive in a reasonable and 
prudent manner based on traffic, road and weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Legislature quickly killed a speed limit bill. But  
that year wound up the most deadly on Montana roads since the early 
1980s, with 265 people dead in traffic accidents, a nearly 34 
percent increase that led the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Support grew for reviving speed limits.  
</P>
<P>
	Then, last December, the Montana Supreme Court threw out the  
last vestige of a daytime speed limit by declaring the basic rule 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we liked it or not, it was like an invitation to  
people who wanted to come to Montana and really see how fast their 
vehicle could go,'' said Al Goke, state Traffic Safety Bureau 
chief. ``We became a testing ground for people who wanted that 
freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the time a state trooper pulled over a convoy of 15  
Mercedes-Benz test drivers clocked at speeds over 95 mph. The 
drivers, apparently testing performance in Montana's high 
altitudes, were fined $70 each. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a new slogan to remind people: ``The sky is not the  
limit; 75 is.'' And on other highways, it is 70 mph during the day 
and 65 mph at night.

<HEADLINE> ADC To Buy Spectracom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNETONKA, Minn. (AP) -- ADC Telecommunications Inc. said it  
would pay $105 million to acquire Spectracom, which makes parts 
used in fiber-optic networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition is expected to be finalized by late June. It  
calls for ADC to pay $60 million in cash, with an additional $45 
million payable based on future technology developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectracom would be ADC's third acquisition in the  
optics-components market in the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
	ADC develops voice, video and data systems for telephone, cable  
television, Internet and wireless communications networks. In 1998, 
it had $1.5 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, ADC bought Australia-based AOFR, which makes coupling  
devices that feed the light from two or more fibers into a single 
fiber. In 1998, it bought Princeton Optics, a company that makes 
parts that align mirrors, prisms and lenses used in optical 
devices.

<HEADLINE> Congress Haggles on HMO Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Partisan maneuvering over patient rights  
legislation continued this week as House Democrats took the first 
step toward forcing a vote on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, meanwhile, bipartisan talks toward compromise  
legislation broke down as lawmakers looked to a long Memorial Day 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats said they had ``little choice'' other than to  
start collecting names on a discharge petition, which would pull 
the popular legislation out of committee and move it directly to 
the House floor. The petition would need 218 signatures -- a 
majority of the House -- to force a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have repeatedly asked the majority for a commitment to  
schedule managed care reform for a vote,'' Rep. John Dingell, 
D-Mich., said Thursday. ``If the leadership is unwilling to 
schedule a vote, they'll have to explain for themselves exactly why 
they are running scared from the electorate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell cited a May 11 letter in which Commerce Committee  
Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va., suggested he would hold hearings 
throughout the summer but did not promise a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., accused Dingell of  
politicizing the issue with the petition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a disappointing maneuver that tells me the Democrat  
leadership has more interest in playing partisan political games 
than in enacting real reform,'' said Hastert, who has promised a 
vote this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliley ``has given public and private assurances'' that the  
committee will debate the issue, said his spokeswoman Christina 
Gungoll, though he has not set a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, there was a similar effort to force a vote on the  
issue, but Republicans brought it to the floor on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, talks have broken down between Sen. William Roth,  
R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee, and Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan of New York, the committee's top Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agreement is not possible at this time,'' Roth said in a  
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Their staffs had been working since February to fashion a  
compromise, but this week, Moynihan walked away, saying little 
progress had been made and there were other priorities.

	A committee spokeswoman, Ginny Flynn, said Republicans thought  
they were ``pretty close'' to an agreement.

	``We felt that it was premature for them to walk away,'' she  
said.

	The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee has

the Finance Committee is responsible for tax-related portions of 
the legislation, including Republican priorities that are 
tangential to patient protections, such as expanding medical 
savings accounts.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on Heat Worries / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices moved higher  
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for very hot 
weather next week in Midwest growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
        Investors seeking to find support after several days of price  
weakness seized on forecasts for above-normal temperatures over the 
next 10 days in major growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
        The warm weather could signal a hot, dry summer that might  
threaten crop yields and reduce what is expected to be bumper production 
after large-scale plantings. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat moved higher as a tour of the soft red winter wheat growing  
regions found heavy rainfall in the past few weeks have reduced yields 
and increased the potential for disease. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for July delivery rose 2 1/2 cents to $2.50 a bushel;  
July corn rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.16 1/2 a bushel; July oats rose 1/2 
cent to $1.21 a bushel; July soybeans rose 1 3/4 cents to $4.57 1/4

<HEADLINE> WWII Relic Returned To Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A small church bell recovered by a U.S.  
soldier in the war ruins of Anzio, Italy, in 1944 is journeying 
home to mark the village's liberation during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am just so elated that it's going back,'' said Herbert Roth,  
84, who grabbed the 9-inch-tall bronze bell as a war memento during 
an Allied offensive in the Mediterranean village, 40 miles south of 
Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I took that bell, it was in a heap of rubble and I  
thought to myself, `How can I leave it ... ?''' Roth said Thursday. 
``Far did I ever know what that bell was or what it meant to 
Italy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bell was used for calling people into Mass at Saints Pio and  
Antonio Catholic Church. On its side is the protruding figure of a 
lion's head, a papal symbol marking the church's founding in 1856. 
</P>
<P>
	After keeping it on a shelf at home for a half-century, Roth  
donated it in 1997 to the Italian American Community Center in 
Gates, a Rochester suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, the Anzio Beach Museum found out the bell had  
survived from members of the community center who went to Anzio 
hoping to find old photographs of the church. 
</P>
<P>
	When the museum asked for its return, the community center  
initially suggested sending a replica. In January, however, its 
board of directors agreed to send the bell back to help Anzio 
commemorate its liberation by U.S. troops 55 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A delegation of nearly 30 people accompanied the bell on a  
flight from Toronto, Canada, to Rome on Thursday night. Roth cannot 
travel because of his frail health. 
</P>
<P>
	His daughter, Lynne Benzing, will read a letter on his behalf  
during a ceremony Sunday in the rebuilt church. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 50,000 soldiers were killed at Anzio in one of the most  
ferocious encounters of the war.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Clinton Help May Hurt Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore might want to keep his  
distance from President Clinton on the campaign trail, a new poll 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released Thursday indicates the  
public, by a 52-to-29 percent margin, says Clinton's active help in 
Gore's campaign would make them less likely to vote for Gore for 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll indicates Americans respect the vice president as a  
person, but have not yet warmed to him as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Four out of five see him as a good husband and father, and a  
majority say he has the experience to be president, is honest and 
trustworthy and cares about the needs of people like them. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has a 2-to-1 lead in the poll among Democrats and those  
leaning Democratic against his sole challenger for the party's 
nomination, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	But four out of 10 of all respondents say there is no chance  
they would vote for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost two-thirds of all respondents say Gore doesn't inspire  
them and 54 percent say he lacks vision on how to solve the big 
problems facing the country. Fifty-seven percent say his stands on 
issues are too close to Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Penn, a pollster and Gore adviser, noted Gore has taken a  
commanding lead among Democrats and has closed the gap in a 
head-to-head matchup against the GOP front-runner, Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush, from 21 points behind a month ago, to 14 points 
behind now. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Gore) is seen as honest, trustworthy and caring about people  
... Those are exactly the qualities that people say are the most 
important to them and what they're looking for in the next 
president,'' Penn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They give high job approval to President Clinton, but they  
want to see what the vice president would do if he were elected 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush leads Elizabeth Dole, former Red Cross president, by almost  
a 3-1 margin among those inclined to vote Republican, with other 
GOP candidates in single digits. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone survey of 1,050 adults was taken Sunday and Monday and  
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The 
margin of error for subgroups like Democrats and Republicans is 
plus or minus 5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> FCC Tries To Conserve Phone Numbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission,  
responding to a growing proliferation of new telephone area codes, 
asked for public guidance Thursday on ways to conserve phone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials and others will have three months to comment  
on several commission proposals. Adoption of at least some of the 
proposals could come early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time telephone users must change area codes due to  
number exhaust, they pay a price in terms of time, money and 
frustration,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said the commission was seeking to take action to  
``avoid confronting a catastrophe in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every area code change forces business and residential customers  
to learn new dialing patterns, and many must upgrade equipment and 
reprint business cards, stationery and advertising. Alarm companies 
also must reprogram auto-dialing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing demand for cellular phones, pagers and second lines for  
modems and fax machines is often blamed. But more at fault is the 
way that numbers are assigned, in blocks of 10,000, which leaves 
many numbers unused. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Pennsylvania goes from four area codes in 1994 to  
nine on June 5. California is projected to have at least 39 by 
2001, three times the 13 it had early 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine is considering a second area code even though the 7.92  
million number combinations available ought to be enough for every 
man, woman and child in the state to have a modem line, a fax 
machine line, a pager and two cell phones, as well as a regular 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States now has about 215 area codes, almost double  
the 119 in service in 1991. Industry officials project the need for 
30 new codes a year unless changes are made. 
</P>
<P>
	The relief options outlined by the commission would not stop new  
area codes in the works but could prevent or delay the need for 
others in the future. Officials said the commission would likely 
adopt more than one conservation mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the existing block system, created in the days of the  
telephone monopoly, competing local carriers acquire a block of 
10,000 numbers for every billing region they wish to serve. An area 
code may cover dozens or hundreds of such regions. 
</P>
<P>
	If a carrier has only 100 customers in a given region, the  
remaining 9,900 numbers of the block are tied up. As few as half of 
the available number combinations for each area code are actually 
assigned before a new code is requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission proposed assigning numbers in smaller blocks,  
such as a thousand at a time, and expanding the size of billing 
regions to reduce the number of blocks needed. The commission also 
proposed administrative changes to require telephone companies to 
assign more of their numbers before requesting new blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Also under consideration is an end to the existing ban on  
assigning different area codes for different types of technology. 
That could pave the way for the use of separate area codes for cell 
phones and pagers outside New York City, where such a mechanism was 
set up before the ban was imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also said it would review ways to charge  
companies that want blocks of numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem that we have is that a resource that has  
substantial value is given away for free,'' said Commissioner 
Harold Furchtgott-Roth.

	Serbs Dismiss War Crimes Indictment  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A senior Yugoslav official today  
dismissed the indictment of President Slobodan Milosevic on war 
crimes as a political maneuver and said his government did not 
recognize the jurisdiction of the U.N. tribunal in the Netherlands. 
Indictments against Milosevic and four others on war crimes charges 
were announced today in The Hague by the tribunal's chief 
prosecutor, Louise Arbour. Goran Matic, a minister in the Belgrade 
government, said the indictments make no sense because in 
Belgrade's view there is no war in Kosovo. The tribunal has said it 
has evidence of war crimes ``on a massive scale.''

said it has so far lost 3 million francs ($500,000) and that at 
least 100,000 people have been turned away due to the strike. The 
striking workers are expected to meet with Prime Minister Lionel 
Jospin Thursday. They want the government hire more people to cope

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, powered by the biggest boom

rate of 4.1 percent in the first three months of the year, the 
government said today. The Commerce Department said the increase in 
the gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, 
occurred despite the fact that America's trade deficit from January 
through March was even worse than originally believed. In a 
separate report, the Labor Department said the number of Americans

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Baseball Future Shaky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Avoiding jail didn't free Darryl Strawberry  
to resume his baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees outfielder pleaded no contest to drug and  
solicitation charges Wednesday, but it's unclear if or when he will 
be reinstated to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next step is between major league baseball and Darryl,''  
said Yankees general manager Brian Cashman. ``After that issue is 
resolved, we will make a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was sentenced to 18 months of probation and ordered  
to undergo testing for drugs twice a week. He is prohibited from 
going within 100 feet of bars, required to complete more drug 
treatment and perform 100 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, he remains on leave from the Yankees and faces  
possible suspension as a multiple offender of baseball's drug 
aftercare program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that Darryl Strawberry's legal proceeding has been  
resolved, I will promptly review all of the facts and circumstances 
surrounding this matter in order to determine what action is 
appropriate under baseball's drug policy,'' commissioner Bud Selig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner added that he would consult with medical  
advisers from baseball, as well as the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre said he couldn't discuss Strawberry's  
status until baseball decides what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is about Darryl as a person,'' Torre said at Yankee  
Stadium. ``In my four years here, he has been nothing but a model 
citizen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ordering Strawberry to stay out of bars, Florida  
Circuit Judge Jack Espinosa Jr. asked local law enforcement 
officials to provide the athlete with a map of Tampa ``hot spots'' 
to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, accompanied by his wife, Charisse, and lawyer Joseph  
Ficarrotta, apologized outside Hillsborough County courthouse. He 
spoke from a handwritten statement before riding off in a white 
van. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his arrest April 14, the eight-time All-Star was  
in Tampa working out in hopes of making a comeback from colon 
cancer surgery in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``My recovery has not been easy,'' he said. ``I am, however,  
committed to it and now that I have finished chemotherapy and feel 
healthy, I'm looking forward to the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, 37, was charged with possession of 0.3 grams of  
cocaine and offering an undercover female police officer $50 for 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Strawberry nor his lawyer answered questions outside  
court. Ficarrotta said Strawberry pleaded no contest ``to get this 
matter behind us and to go forward with his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors insisted the outfielder did not get special  
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is his first criminal drug offense,'' said assistant  
state attorney Pam Bondi. ``That's why he was placed on probation 
with intensive drug treatment and community service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the arrest, Strawberry was placed on administrative  
leave that barred him from training or playing for the Yankees or 
any of their farm teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees have struggled at times this season, and Torre  
conceded there have been occasions that having Strawberry on the 
team might have helped. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you are losing games and leaving men on base, you tend to  
look for more bats,'' he said. ``There have been a few games where 
we could really use a left-handed bat off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``Straw is an imposing figure. He intimidates the opposition. It  
is a nice weapon to have.''

<HEADLINE>  Shuttle Heads for Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Loaded with supplies for the new  
international space station, Discovery lifted off Thursday on 
NASA's first shuttle flight in six months -- the longest gap since 
the Challenger disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a long time,'' launch director Ralph Roe said.  
``We're all just extremely happy to be launching again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The practically flawless, sunrise launch came after a string of  
six U.S. rocket failures since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The space station was soaring 235 miles over the Atlantic, east  
of the Carolinas, when Discovery blasted off in pursuit with a crew 
of seven. The mission is scheduled to last 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery will catch up with the space station early Saturday.  
Commander Kent Rominger and his U.S., Canadian and Russian crew 
will be the first astronauts to actually dock with the mostly empty 
outpost. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time astronauts visited the 16-nation space station,  
back in December, they had to connect the first two components. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the construction work will be relatively light. Two  
astronauts will take a spacewalk this weekend to attach one crane 
and parts of another, as well as bags of tools, to the outside of 
the station. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew will spend the rest of the nearly six days of joint  
flight unloading 2 tons of spare parts, computers, clothes and 
other supplies for future station residents, and fixing broken or 
noisy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA was especially vigilant going into Thursday's launch, given  
the six-month gap between shuttle flights. The fleet was grounded 
for more than 2 1/2 years following the 1986 Challenger accident and 
grounded for almost six months in 1990 because of dangerous fuel 
leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest hiatus had nothing to do with the shuttle, but rather  
a critical Russian space station component that has held up the 
entire project and a NASA X-ray telescope that has been grounded 
for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	A hailstorm added to the delay. Hail battered the shuttle's  
giant fuel tank earlier this month, and NASA postponed the flight 
one week to fix the hundreds of dings. Speckled with patches, the 
tank dropped away, its job done, as Discovery slipped into orbit 
eight minutes after liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA worked hard to stay sharp after the last shuttle flight,  
Endeavour's Dec. 4 launch to the space station. Engineers conducted 
extra countdown practices and spent extra time reviewing 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last August, two unmanned U.S. rockets have blown up,  
three others have left satellites in useless orbits, and another 
rocket dragged a satellite back down through the atmosphere, where 
it burned up. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the U.S. rocket industry was so severely stricken  
was back in the mid-1980s, when the casualties included Challenger 
and its crew of seven. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA had nothing to do with the latest string of rocket  
failures. Even so, shuttle managers couldn't help but notice the 
anxiety surrounding Discovery's liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did not bother me, although I sensed in the surrounding  
community there was a heightened expectation, or a heightened 
awareness of the potential for failure,'' said Donald McMonagle, a 
launch manager. ``But I'm very happy to say we have intact a good 
vehicle.''

<HEADLINE> Backstreet Boys Set Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thanks largely to teen-aged girls -- and maybe  
their moms -- the Backstreet Boys have set a new standard in music 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The cute quintet sold 1.13 million copies of their new album  
last week, shattering a record for one-week sales set less than six 
months ago by country star Garth Brooks, according to Soundscan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected a great first week,'' said Tom Carrabba, general  
manager of Jive Records, which marketed the release. ``We just 
didn't know it could be this great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The album, ``Millennium,'' is the successor to the band's 10  
million-selling, self-entitled debut, which came out almost two 
years ago, and contains the hit song, ``I Want it That Way.'' The 
new album went on sale May 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Backstreet Boys, Ricky Martin, TLC and Britney Spears are  
leading a resurgence in music sales among teen-agers. After a few 
years when the industry worried it was losing teens to computers 
and video games, young listeners are flooding music stores again. 
</P>
<P>
	While young girls make up the Backstreet Boys' prime audience,  
Jive has carefully marketed the group's ballads to an adult market 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this is just girls,'' said Tom Calderone, MTV's  
senior vice president of music programming. ``The moms are out 
there and the girls are with their boyfriends, who are singing 
along sheepishly. I think it's bigger than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MTV drew thousands of fans to its Time Square studio for a  
Backstreet Boys appearance last weekend, and estimated more than 
nine million people watched related specials about the band. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Latin sensation Martin sold 660,000 copies  
of his new album during its first week of release. 
</P>
<P>
	Soundscan has been measuring album sales in the United States  
since 1991; precise sales figures before then are considered 
somewhat unreliable. Brooks' ``Double Live'' album sold 1.08 
million in its first week of release in November.

<HEADLINE> Cloned Sheep May Age Prematurely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Genetic warning signs that Dolly the cloned sheep is aging  
prematurely raise questions not only about the safety of cloning 
entire animals, but about using cloned cells to help fight 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	A new study suggests that animals copied from the DNA of adults  
show signs of wear on a molecular level equal to that of their 
older parents. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dolly's case, she is 3, but her genetic material is aging at  
the rate of the 6-year-old sheep from which she was cloned. She may 
be susceptible to premature aging and disease, according to 
Scottish geneticists who created her. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, Dolly appears to be healthy and normal, and there is  
no indication that she will die prematurely, according to findings 
reported today in the journal Nature by the Roslin Institute of 
Scotland and an affiliated company, PPL Therapeutics. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolly in 1996 became the first large animal to be cloned from  
genetic material extracted from an adult cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Now her creators have determined that the ``caps'' on Dolly's  
DNA that regulate a cell's life span -- called telomeres -- are 
shorter than average. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, geneticists say Dolly could age faster and run a  
higher-than-usual risk of cancer, which occurs when cells fail to 
self-destruct and begin uncontrolled growth. Sheep normally live 
about 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding adds to the ethical and medical concerns about the  
consequences of cloning other animals, including humans, 
researchers said. But human cloning, if allowed, is a distant 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only years from now, it would be a relevant question to ask if  
a cloned child would have a shorter life span even though it 
appears to be healthy and normal,'' said Marie DeBernadino, a 
biologist at the Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Of more immediate concern is how telomere length might affect  
human cells cloned to help fight diseases, rather than cloning an 
entire human. 
</P>
<P>
	Stem cells are the building blocks from which the body's organs  
and tissues grow. Researchers are experimenting with stem-cell 
transplants to help patients repair their own diseased organs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloning is an efficient way to make stem cells widely available.  
But the use of cloned versions of fast-dividing, short-lived cells 
such as those in the digestive tract might be limited. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would have to reevaluate cloning depending on the  
application of the cells,'' said developmental biologist Eric 
Overstrom of Tufts University, where he and others cloned three 
goats last April. 
</P>
<P>
	``Longer-lived cells, such as those in the brain, might be  
better candidates,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the results of the latest study are verified, it would  
complicate if not limit future cloning of animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a clear indication that cloning is unsafe, but it is  
a caution sign. It should be watched very closely,'' said Stanford 
law professor Henry Greely, a member of the California Advisory 
Commission on Human Cloning. 
</P>
<P>
	Others questioned whether premature genetic wear and tear would  
have any practical impact on a cloned animal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It remains to be seen if this is biologically relevant,''  
Overstrom said. ``As for concerns about how it might affect cloning 
of humans, it is way too early to assign a meaningful assessment.''

<HEADLINE>  Shuttle Heads for Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Loaded with supplies for the new  
international space station, Discovery lifted off Thursday on 
NASA's first shuttle flight in six months -- the longest gap since 
the Challenger disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a long time,'' launch director Ralph Roe said.  
``We're all just extremely happy to be launching again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The practically flawless, sunrise launch came after a string of  
six U.S. rocket failures since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The space station was soaring 235 miles over the Atlantic, east  
of the Carolinas, when Discovery blasted off in pursuit with a crew 
of seven. The mission is scheduled to last 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery will catch up with the space station early Saturday.  
Commander Kent Rominger and his U.S., Canadian and Russian crew 
will be the first astronauts to actually dock with the mostly empty 
outpost. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time astronauts visited the 16-nation space station,  
back in December, they had to connect the first two components. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the construction work will be relatively light. Two  
astronauts will take a spacewalk this weekend to attach one crane 
and parts of another, as well as bags of tools, to the outside of 
the station. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew will spend the rest of the nearly six days of joint  
flight unloading 2 tons of spare parts, computers, clothes and 
other supplies for future station residents, and fixing broken or 
noisy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA was especially vigilant going into Thursday's launch, given  
the six-month gap between shuttle flights. The fleet was grounded 
for more than 2 1/2 years following the 1986 Challenger accident and 
grounded for almost six months in 1990 because of dangerous fuel 
leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest hiatus had nothing to do with the shuttle, but rather  
a critical Russian space station component that has held up the 
entire project and a NASA X-ray telescope that has been grounded 
for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	A hailstorm added to the delay. Hail battered the shuttle's  
giant fuel tank earlier this month, and NASA postponed the flight 
one week to fix the hundreds of dings. Speckled with patches, the 
tank dropped away, its job done, as Discovery slipped into orbit 
eight minutes after liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA worked hard to stay sharp after the last shuttle flight,  
Endeavour's Dec. 4 launch to the space station. Engineers conducted 
extra countdown practices and spent extra time reviewing 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last August, two unmanned U.S. rockets have blown up,  
three others have left satellites in useless orbits, and another 
rocket dragged a satellite back down through the atmosphere, where 
it burned up. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the U.S. rocket industry was so severely stricken  
was back in the mid-1980s, when the casualties included Challenger 
and its crew of seven. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA had nothing to do with the latest string of rocket  
failures. Even so, shuttle managers couldn't help but notice the 
anxiety surrounding Discovery's liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did not bother me, although I sensed in the surrounding  
community there was a heightened expectation, or a heightened 
awareness of the potential for failure,'' said Donald McMonagle, a 
launch manager. ``But I'm very happy to say we have intact a good 
vehicle.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers May Want Rambis As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers are leaning strongly  
toward hiring Kurt Rambis as permanent coach, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that several  
unidentified sources close to the situation said key Laker 
executives favor the selection of Rambis, who took over on an 
interim basis from Del Harris in February. 
</P>
<P>
	No contract negotiations have begun and team executive vice  
president Jerry West and general manager Mitch Kupchak have yet to 
formally present Rambis as their choice to owner Jerry Buss, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers spokesman John Black said the team had no comment on the  
Times report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not ready to discuss that publicly yet,'' Black said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rambis led the Lakers past Houston in the first round of the NBA  
playoffs before losing four straight to San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The feeling is this team has to grow together, and you don't  
do that by firing the coach after such a traumatic season,'' one 
Times source said. 
</P>
<P>
	West and Kupchak surveyed key Laker players about Rambis and  
several -- led by a rousing endorsement by Kobe Bryant -- said they 
would fully support his return, the Times sources said.

<HEADLINE> NFL Commits Stadium Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The NFL is using its financial clout to put an  
end to franchise free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a new financial policy approved at the March meetings, the  
league committed more than $200 million Wednesday to help three of 
its bedrock franchises -- New England, Philadelphia and Denver -- 
build new stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy was put into place as one way of solving the  
franchise movement that reached its peak four years ago when the 
Rams and Raiders deserted Los Angeles, the Browns left Cleveland 
and the Oilers left Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The league has expanded to Cleveland and is working on putting a  
new team in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a crucial policy for the league to have strong footing in  
the largest media markets,'' said Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey 
Lurie, one of the beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy allows backing of up to 50 percent of private  
financing used for stadiums in the top six markets and 34 percent 
in those below that level. 
</P>
<P>
	New England and Philadelphia are in the first group and Denver  
in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos owner Patrick Bowlen said he expects a commitment of $43  
million to $44 million, and the Eagles expect close to $50 million 
to $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots, recommitted to Massachusetts after a withdrawing a  
plan to move to Hartford, Conn., could get more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	All three already have various commitments for public financing.  
</P>
<P>
	In other action on the final day of the league's spring meeting:  
</P>
<P>
	--The owners rejected a proposal to move kickoffs from the 30- to  
the 25-yard line to encourage returns. That first came up in March 
and was tabled, but proponents were still unable to get a 
consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	--The owners awarded the 2003 Super Bowl to San Diego, replacing  
San Francisco, which will not have a new stadium ready. South 
Florida was the only other contender. 
</P>
<P>
	--The league unveiled the technology for its new replay system,  
to be reinstated this fall after seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	--The owners extended NFL Europe for at least another season.  
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest impact long term is the commitment to financing  
both new stadiums and stadium improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	For while the money is more collateral than loan, it will allow  
the teams involved to get a commitment for funds to build stadiums 
and to get them at lower interest rates than they might have. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also not likely to cost the teams involved. Money will be  
paid back from club seat revenues that go to visiting teams, which 
get 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In part, it's a continuation of a league policy. But never  
before has the NFL backed as much as half the building cost. 
Thirty-four percent was the most committed in the past, and most of 
that was for renovations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an evolutionary thing not a new thing,'' commissioner  
Paul Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't sit well with everyone.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tax on all the teams that won't benefit,'' said Al  
Davis of the Raiders. ``Never before in the history of the league 
have the poor given to the rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who recently withdrew from a  
$380 million stadium deal in Connecticut and now has $70 million in 
state money from Massachusetts to help build roads around his new 
stadium, suggested it was simply a case of partners helping each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	``Helping each other is one way to get things done,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On replay, the owners were shown the technology in which coaches  
will get two challenges a game, plus an unlimited number in the 
last two minutes of each half. The calls will be made by a replay 
official from a stadium booth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a system designed to correct a mistake that the whole  
world knows is a mistake,'' said Dennis Lewin, the league's top 
television official.

<HEADLINE> Helms Seeks Changess to ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms reminded President Clinton  
Wednesday he wants the White House to submit proposed modifications 
by next week to a nuclear arms treaty he opposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,  
favors taking amendments to the 27-year-old Anti-Ballistic Missile 
treaty to the floor so the Republican-controlled Senate can vote to 
pull the United States out of the entire treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have given the president until next week to fulfill his  
legally binding certification that he will submit a succession 
arrangement to the treaty,'' the North Carolina Republican said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consideration of such a document will be more than a political  
referendum on the treaty,'' Helms said. ``It will be a very real 
debate over whether the Senate will bring the ABM treaty out of 
legal limbo or hold it in abeyance forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms and other conservatives consider the pact dead because the  
Soviet Union, with which it was negotiated, no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration and other Democrats such as Sen.  
Joseph Biden, D-Del., the committee's ranking minority member, 
disagree. They say Russia as a successor to the Soviet Union must 
be consulted on any treaty modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABM treaty is standing in the way of proceeding with a plan  
to establish a national missile defense system. Such a system is 
prohibited by the treaty, and the administration contends that 
Moscow would have to agree to any move by the United States to set 
one up. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has warned that deployment of a missile defense system  
would violate the ABM treaty, trigger a new arms race and threaten 
the whole system of international disarmament treaties. China 
agrees with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms said the administration was developing blueprints for the  
system ``not on the basis of the best technology available but on 
the basis of what can be most easily negotiated with Russia in a 
revised ABM treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was not widely known that the Clinton administration  
is seeking to reconstitute the ABM Treaty with four new partners -- 
Russia and three other former Soviet republics, Ukraine, Belarus 
and Kazakhstan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I shall do everything within my power to ensure that the ABM  
treaty is never resurrected or reconstituted, regardless of whether 
the president proposes one other party to the treaty or 20,'' Helms 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying before Helms' committee, former Secretary of State  
Henry Kissinger said he supported the administration's view that if 
modifications to the treaty cannot be obtained, the United States 
should consider withdrawing from it. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the threat to the United States from missile  
proliferation was real and growing, and the ABM treaty should not 
be allowed to stand in the way of developing a missile defense 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is ample time to conduct the necessary negotiations,  
since the shape of the system is still under consideration and no 
violation would occur until deployment,'' Kissinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said research on the new system must proceed and not be  
delayed pending negotiations. He also said deployment must take 
place as soon as a system is chosen.

<HEADLINE> Longer Trading Approved for Nasdaq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Come autumn, investors could be buying and  
selling shares of Microsoft Corp. and 99 other companies on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market while watching Ally McBeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers, which governs  
Nasdaq, today approved a plan to extend trading hours from the 
current 9:30 a.m.-4 p.m. Eastern time schedule. A second session of 
the day would likely start at 5:30 p.m. and end at 9 p.m. or 10 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are expected to take effect around September, after  
a review by the Securities and Exchange Commission and discussions 
with industry leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``This business of extended hours is a serious market-quality  
question, and it needs to be addressed with a great deal of 
seriousness,'' said Frank Zarb, chairman and chief executive of the 
National Association of Securities Dealers. ``It requires some 
though and intensive coordination if it's going to be done 
properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has been urging restraint, proposing a delay until next  
year so that the securities industry would not be extending trading 
hours at the same time it is confronting the Year 2000 computer bug 
and preparing to shift from reporting stock prices in fractions to 
the use of decimals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zarb said Nasdaq is still sticking with its plans for  
starting night trading around September. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear the marketplace needs this kind of innovation, and  
we are going to provide the leadership to get us from here to 
there,'' Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	The groundbreaking decision, which could throw many Wall Street  
companies into chaos, is being made to accommodate the growing 
number of investors who trade at home over the Internet. But the 
securities industry, especially smaller firms, will have to find 
ways for brokers and backroom recordkeepers to accommodate the 
nighttime business. 
</P>
<P>
	In a poll for the CNBC financial cable news channel, 53 percent  
of active investors 21 years of age or older liked the idea of 
trading well into the evening, while 31 percent opposed the move. 
The poll of more than 500 people and had a margin of error of plus 
or minus 4.4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, trading would be limited to Nasdaq's 100 largest,  
nonfinancial companies, led by Microsoft and including such other 
well-known stocks as Intel Corp., Northwest Airlines Corp. and MCI 
WorldCom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks would still have a final, closing price reported at the 4  
p.m. end of the daytime session. Any after-hour trades would count 
toward the following day's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities subject to stock splits, or stock dividends would be  
suspended from trading in the evening session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are calling on the industry to do the right thing, to  
coordinate and be responsible and move in unison so the investor 
can be properly protected in the new world of extended hours,'' 
Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange  
said the Big Board also is considering a plan to extend its trading 
hours as September. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the traditional markets are facing increased competition  
from overseas exchanges, which often trade shares of U.S.-based 
companies, and from alternative computer-based exchanges in the 
United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Zarb acknowledged that he has been approached by New  
York city and state officials about moving into part of the new 
facility that is being built for the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have looked at it and we have asked them for more  
information,'' he said, but added, ``Based upon what we know now, 
it's not our favorite option by a longshot.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 146 but Nasdaq Gains 3 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks resumed a downward lurch today as  
continued concerns about interest rates and inflation put the 
brakes on Wednesday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 146.24 at 10,555.92. It then dropped as much as 190 in early 
afternoon trading, more than wiping out all of Wednesday's gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 10.34 at 1,294.42, but the Nasdaq 
composite index was up 3.29 at 2,430.46 at midday, then slipped 
again into negative territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow rose 171.07 points Wednesday, a gain of 1.6 percent, to  
close at 10,702.16. The rally was fed by big gains from IBM and a 
slight resurgence of Internet companies that have slid in recent 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the selling today was attributed to investors cashing in  
on Wednesday's rally in advance of the Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, continued fears that inflation will prompt the  
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates drew investors away from 
stocks. Higher interest rates can crimp corporate profits as it 
becomes more expensive for companies to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	New government figures on the economy today kept the market off  
balance. The Commerce Department said the U.S. economy grew at a 
robust annual rate of 4.1 percent in the first quarter, yet an 
inflation gauge tied to the report rose a modest 1.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices tumbled, sending the yield up to 5.82 percent from  
5.80 percent late Wednesday and further pressuring stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the government also said corporate profits showed a big  
rebound in the first three months of this year, increasing at an 
annual rate of $31.8 billion after having fallen at a rate of $5.3 
billion in the fourth quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't enough to entice buyers.  
</P>
<P>
	``There hasn't been any catalyst to bring people into the  
marketplace,'' said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; 
Co. in Milwaukee. The upcoming three-day holiday may also 
discourage money managers from taking big new positions, Berman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM fell 2 9/16 to 115 9/16 today. The stock split 2-for-1 after  
the close of trading Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank and brokerage stocks, which typically suffer when interest  
rates rise, were mostly lower. J.P. Morgan was off 2 9/16 at 136 
5/16, and Bank of America fell 2 1/16 to 63 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	And cyclical stocks, which have risen in recent weeks, fell as  
investors locked in their gains. 3M was the biggest loser among Dow 
components, falling 3 3/4 to 85 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 350.0 million 
shares at midday, trailing Wednesday's brisk pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 5.17 at 619.67, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 2.20 at 780.46.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two women and a lawyer were accused Thursday of  
running an illegal adoption ring that sold Mexican children to 
American families for $20,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
	The women provided adoptions without any of the necessary  
paperwork for either immigration or adoption, according to court 
documents. And several children, some of whom were as young as 2 
weeks old, had serious medical problems despite assurances they 
were healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thrilled,'' said Rosalie Liberto, a Long Island woman who  
adopted a little girl two years ago and is still fighting to 
resolve her immigration status. ``We were heartbroken. We put our 
trust in people and they took advantage of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene Lieberman, 48, and Arlene Reingold, 47, neighbors who  
live on New York's Long Island, and Mario Reyes, a Mexican lawyer 
with a home in Arizona, were charged with conspiracy to violate 
immigration laws in connection with 17 illegal adoptions in the 
Long Island area. They were also charged with mail and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Court documents said the women arranged more than 500 adoptions,  
but those adoptions are not being scrutinized as part of this case, 
assistant U.S. attorney Timothy Macht said. 
</P>
<P>
	Macht said he could not comment on how the children were  
obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes, 40, was arrested Wednesday night at his home in Douglas,  
Ariz., which abuts a Mexican border town called Agua Prieta where 
he had a law office. Each woman was released on $150,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum for the charges is 10 years in prison for each child  
illegally smuggled into the country. The wire and mail fraud charge 
carries a sentence of up to 5 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers allege that Reyes paid to have babies smuggled  
across the border to his Arizona home, sometimes by Mexican women 
posing as the children's mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of the children had serious medical problems.  
</P>
<P>
	One couple was presented with a 7-year-old girl who was mentally  
retarded, malnourished and also showed signs of sexual abuse. The 
couple, in their 50s, returned her to Mrs. Lieberman and never got 
a refund on their $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities repeatedly denied the pair's attempts to become  
licensed. The two women ran businesses called Stork International 
and International Adoption Consultants, presenting themselves as 
adoption information experts, state DSS officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lieberman's phone number is unlisted. A man who answered  
the phone at Mrs. Reingold's home had no comment. Calls placed to 
lawyers representing the women were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general's office also brought charges against  
the women, as well as their husbands, Jay Lieberman and Dennis 
Reingold, charging them with fraud and with repeatedly arranging 
illegal adoptions.

<HEADLINE> Results of Campaign 2000 Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some results from a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll on the 2000  
presidential campaign. When results don't total 100 percent, the 
remainder either didn't know or refused to answer. 

</P>
<P>
	 *Asked of Republicans or Republican leaners:    	
</P>
<P>
	--Which of these candidates would you be most likely to support  
for the Republican nomination for president in the year 2000? 
</P>
<P>
	George W. Bush, 46 percent; Elizabeth Dole, 18 percent; Dan  
Quayle, 7 percent; Patrick Buchanan, 6 percent; John McCain, 6 
percent; Steve Forbes, 5 percent; Gary Bauer, 2 percent; John 
Kasich, 2 percent; Bob Smith, 2 percent; Lamar Alexander, 1 
percent. Bush has held a lead of 20 points or more over Dole since 
the beginning of this year. 

</P>
<P>
	 *Asked of Democrats or Democratic leaners:    	
</P>
<P>
	--Which of these candidates are you most likely to support for  
the Democratic nomination for president in the year 2000? 
</P>
<P>
	Al Gore, 59 percent; Bill Bradley, 30 percent. Gore had held a  
lead of 20 points or more over Bradley since the beginning of this 
year. 

</P>
<P>
	 *Asked of all respondents:    	
</P>
<P>
	--As of today, who do you lean more toward, Al Gore, the  
Democrat, or George W. Bush, the Republican? 
</P>
<P>
	George W. Bush, 54 percent; Al Gore, 40 percent. In mid-April,  
Bush led Gore 59-38. 

</P>
<P>
	--Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for Al Gore for  
president if President Clinton were to actively support him and 
campaign for him? 
</P>
<P>
	More likely, 29 percent; less likely, 52 percent; no difference,  
18 percent. 

</P>
<P>
	The phone survey of 1,050 adults was taken Sunday and Monday and  
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points. For 
subgroups like Democrats and Republicans, the margin of error is 
plus or minus 5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> British Celebrate Soccer `Miracle' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Amazing. Unbelievable. Miraculous.  
</P>
<P>
	There was no shortage of superlatives Thursday as the British  
press hailed Manchester United's improbable 2-1 victory over Bayern 
Munich in the final of the European Champions Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Mirror went so far as to describe the triumph in a  
banner front-page headline as ``The greatest 2 minutes in the 
history of sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another tabloid, The Daily Mail, wasn't quite as extravagant,  
downplaying the victory -- on goals by substitutes Teddy Sheringham 
and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in second-half injury time -- as merely 
``the most dramatic night ever for British football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Football? Bloody Hell'' read a headline in The Sun, quoting  
the first words from United coach Alex Ferguson -- being touted for 
knighthood -- after the team's first European Champions Cup title in 
31 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``King of Europe'' said The Express, calling the victory the  
``most dramatic comeback in football history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quick-to-attack tabloids have been the fiercest critics of  
English soccer's recent lack of success. 
</P>
<P>
	The game went into decline after all English clubs were banned  
from European soccer for five years when 39 people -- mostly Italian 
-- died in 1985 at Heysel Stadium in Brussels in rioting caused by 
English hooligans. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the same tabloids declared English soccer the best  
in Europe. The French sports daily L'Equipe added, ``God is 
English.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In large type, The Daily Mail set off a quote from Sir Bobby  
Charlton, the hero of England's 1966 World Cup-winning team and the 
leader of the last Man United team to win the Champions Cup (1968). 
</P>
<P>
	``After so long in the wilderness, we have something to show for  
being the best,'' Charlton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper also summed up the Germans' fate: ``Bayern simply  
fell apart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tabloids also put a predictable anti-German, jingoistic spin  
on several headlines, conjuring up images from World War II that 
always seem to surface when England plays Germany in any match. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Subs Sink Germans'' bellowed The Sun.  
</P>
<P>
	``Two subs sent on, torpedoes away,'' added the Daily Mail.  
</P>
<P>
	Not to be outdone, the Daily Star's front page blared  
``Hunbelievable.'' Inside, the newspaper added: ``Super-Subs Sink 
Krauts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Manchester United and Alex Ferguson last night found their  
Holy Grail,'' began The Times' Page 1 story. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Telegraph called the victory before 90,000 in Spain  
``one of the most astonishing finales in European football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Guardian summed it up this way.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was an astonishing setting to host the astonishing climax  
to an astounding season. Barcelona's (stadium) ... reduces the most 
resolute of spines to jelly. And that was before the kickoff.''

<HEADLINE> Original U.S. Flag To Be Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Starting Friday, the public will be able to  
watch restoration efforts on the original ``Star-Spangled Banner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Removed from public display six months ago, the flag is now  
partially rolled out in a specially built laboratory for a 
three-year, $18.2 million restoration. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of  
American History will file past a 50-foot floor-to-ceiling glass 
wall. Behind it, technicians with microscopes and needles are busy 
picking out an estimated 1.7 million stitches that attached the 
flag to a linen backing in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the flag Maj. George Armistead raised over Baltimore's Fort  
McHenry during the War of 1812. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer Francis Scott Key watched, detained on a  
British ship, and exulted on the back of a letter that the 
star-spangled banner still waved despite an all-night bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
	The frustrated British fleet sailed off.  
</P>
<P>
	Museum visitors can hear ``To Anacreon in Heaven,'' the English  
drinking-song that Key's verses were set to. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag used to be much bigger -- 42 feet by 30 feet instead of  
the present 33 feet by 30 feet -- because souvenir hunters snipped 
off bits until the Armistead family lent it to the Smithsonian 
Institution in 1907 and later donated it. It cost $405.90 when 
Armistead had it made a month before the battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Treatment of the flag began with a test of the fibers, a mapping  
of the damaged areas and a careful vacuuming. Work will continue 
with solvents and detergents. No decision has been made on how it 
will be displayed when the job is finished.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Newspaper Publisher Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DE QUEEN, Ark. (AP) -- Ray Kimball, who started his 79-year  
newspaper career as a boy at his father's paper and worked until 
two months ago as publisher of the weekly De Queen Bee and De Queen 
Daily Citizen, has died at age 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimball, who died Wednesday at a Norman, Okla., nursing home,  
was in his Arkansas office every day until early March, when a 
brain tumor was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimball began his career as a 12-year-old in his father's paper  
in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1940s, he developed a Teletypesetter network that  
eventually linked nine Arkansas dailies. Later, the system was used 
by other newspaper groups and The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, his newspaper was among the first in Arkansas to  
make its news available on the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, he received the National Newspaper Association's  
highest award -- the Amos Award -- given for outstanding 
contributions to the newspaper business and his community, and his 
support of the nation's community newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the epitome of an excellent country newspaperman,'' said  
Jay Jackson, former publisher of the Van Buren County Democrat at 
Clinton. ``He was progressive. He was always thinking ahead. He 
never grew old in his thinking and he always wanted to be better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Schick, executive director of the Arkansas Press  
Association, called Kimball ``a newspaper pioneer within the state 
and every journalist owes him a debt of gratitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kimball moved to Arkansas in 1931 when he and his father bought  
the Horatio Times weekly. Shortly afterward, he bought the weekly 
Sevier County Citizen, merged it with the Horatio paper and moved 
his family to De Queen. A year later, he purchased the De Queen Bee 
and became publisher of the Bee and the Daily Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1939, Kimball and C.E. Palmer bought controlling interest in  
the Magnolia Banner News. He was editor and publisher from 1939 to 
1947, except for a three-year stint as an aviation officer in the 
Navy. His wife, Evelyn, managed the newspaper in his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1940, the Kimballs went to Chicago, where he learned the  
mechanical aspects of Teletypesetter equipment and his wife learned 
the operator's role. In 1942, he helped set up the equipment in his 
paper and several of Palmer's papers, linking them by telephone 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his system, a stenographer at Hot Springs would transcribe  
wire service stories onto a perforated tape, which was fed into a 
transmitter that would carry a signal to outlying papers. 
</P>
<P>
	On the receiving end, Teletypesetters would feed a Linotype  
machine directly, setting type without an operator. The Associated 
Press and other news agencies adopted the system after World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service will be held Saturday. Survivors include a  
daughter and three granddaughters.

<HEADLINE> Police Get Personal in Online Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEESBURG, Va. (AP) -- An old black ledger with gold trim, its  
tidy columns written in ink, sits in Loudoun County's 19th century 
brick courthouse, looking like some journal on criminal justice 
past. But its contents are hardly old fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Containing a list of search warrants being sought by police  
around the nation, it is a catalog of sorts, pointing to 
pedophiles, harassers, stalkers, terrorists, murderers -- and the 
high tech means being used to catch them. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with those warrants, police visit the nearby headquarters  
of America Online and retrieve information that people on the 
Internet never dreamed would end up in the hands of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Private e-mail between lovers. The threatening missives of  
haters. The true identities of people hiding behind screen names in 
a medium they thought was the essence of secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know who you are and where you live,'' an anonymous  
hatemonger e-mailed a 12-year-old girl in Lancaster, Pa. By peeking 
into the accounts of Internet providers, police can often say the 
same thing: They will know who the threatening people are and where 
they live. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, if you break the law, it can be traced,'' says Ron  
Horack, point man for AOL-related investigations at the county 
sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, federal authorities said they had charged a  
northern Virginia pediatrician with possessing child pornography 
after investigating his AOL account and finding explicit images 
sent to him by e-mail over the course of nearly six months. They 
said they then found more child pornography on his computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The pediatrician had been posing as a 16-year-old girl in e-mail  
correspondence with a man who had been sending him the images, 
police said. Possessing child pornography is a federal crime when 
it has been distributed across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Go for a walk, drive a car or spin circles in the moonlight and  
chances are, no one notices. Take a journey on the Internet and a 
trail is left. Police are on that trail in a growing number of 
criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	With an approved warrant, they can look at the electronic mail  
and other online communications of people suspected of a range of 
crimes, getting information not just from a home computer but often 
the company that provides the Internet, e-mail or chat service. 
</P>
<P>
	They can do the same with victims, in the process seeing mail  
from people who had nothing to do with a crime. Everything from 
humdrum to-do lists to love letters from illicit digital dalliances 
becomes potential evidence, and eventually a matter of public 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a growing risk to privacy,'' says Marc Rotenberg,  
executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, 
who says police should stick to traditional methods such as stings, 
informants and forensic evidence, which don't invade people's 
communications. Says Horack: ``If they're going to use the Internet 
for their crime, we're going to use the Internet to catch them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Decatur, Ala., police have been tightlipped about their  
investigation of the March 12 killing of Karen Croft Tipton, 39, 
wife of a prominent local psychiatrist. She was stabbed to death in 
her home. 
</P>
<P>
	But in their affidavit at the Virginia courthouse, they disclose  
she was using her computer about the time of her attack and was 
still signed on to AOL when her body was discovered. Their warrant 
sought access to her e-mail, the content of her ``buddy list'' -- a 
more immediate way for people on AOL to communicate -- and other 
information related to her screen names and those of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Information was retrieved, put on a computer disk and sent with  
some documents to Decatur police. So far no arrest has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities turned to AOL to see some of the online activities  
of the two high school students who killed 13 other people and 
themselves in Littleton, Colo. They've used it to try to track down 
some of the copycat threats that have closed many schools since. 
</P>
<P>
	They took the same route, with so far inconclusive results,  
after a woman in Pennsylvania was told in a chat room, ``I 
guarantee you I will hurt you if you don't listen to me.'' And they 
checked the Internet when a man in New York was charged with 
attempted murder of his wife, who, police say, was having a 
passionate online encounter her husband happened to see. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL is extremely law-enforcement friendly,'' Horack says.  
``They don't hold anything back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, the world's largest Internet service provider,  
or ISP, tells its nearly 18 million customers it won't read or 
disclose private communication or personal identifying information 
except under a ``valid legal process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other major service providers, as well as separate online e-mail  
services and Internet hubs such as Hotmail and Yahoo, say much the 
same, although the disclaimers may be hard to find in screens of 
small print. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a long-standing policy of cooperation with law  
enforcement,'' said AOL spokesman Rich D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
	Communications such as e-mail are disclosed only in criminal  
investigations and with a warrant, he says. In response to orders 
in civil cases, AOL may give out information allowing someone's 
real name to be matched to a screen name. 
</P>
<P>
	So if a spouse is found to be having an online affair with  
someone known only as Heart4U, the identity of that cyberlover 
might eventually be uncovered in a divorce proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon Inc. obtained subpoenas to identify 21 people, most of  
them employees, said to have been spreading corporate secrets and 
gripes in an anonymous online chat room. 
</P>
<P>
	It then dropped a lawsuit it had brought against the 21, each  
identified as ``John Doe,'' indicating to privacy experts that the 
company had gone to court in the first place only to learn the 
identities of the chatters. Four employees quit; others entered 
corporate ``counseling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates worry authorities could go on increasingly  
invasive fishing expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are simply many more events that are recorded (online)  
that would not be recorded in the physical world,'' says Rotenberg. 
``I think it is going to become an enormous problem as people 
become more and more dependent on ISPs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, tools continue to be developed to protect anonymity --  
a site called anonymizer.com, for one, will relay e-mail, stripping 
out the sender's identifying information. 
</P>
<P>
	A review of more than 100 AOL warrants filed in Leesburg this  
year shows that most involve alleged pedophiles, stalkers and 
harassers who have used the Internet to find prey and left evidence 
of their intentions with victims or undercover police. 
</P>
<P>
	Horack prepares warrant applications for police from other parts  
of the country, some so new to digital detective work they need 
their children's help to get online. Once approved by a magistrate, 
he takes them to AOL and retrieves the information. It's almost a 
full-time job, offered by the sheriff because the company gives 
such a big boost to the county. 
</P>
<P>
	The warrants are especially effective against child  
pornographers, Horack says. ``Pedophiles are pack rats. They don't 
throw away anything.'' Even when they do delete material from their 
computer, it might be found at the service provider. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of the 12-year-old Pennsylvania girl, nothing turned  
up in the AOL search. Most of the time, something does. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Hendersonville, Tenn., turned to AOL to see the  
Internet activity of Dennis Wayne Cope, 47, shot and found dead in 
a crawl space of his home in February. 
</P>
<P>
	In an affidavit seeking access to Cope's e-mail, ``buddy list  
content'' and other online activities, police said he had been 
corresponding online with the estranged wife of suspect Robert Lee 
Pattee. They also say Pattee's hand print was found at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Pattee has been charged with first-degree murder.

<HEADLINE> Germany or Mexico To Get Indy Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Germany or Mexico will be the next country to be  
introduced to Indy-car racing, according to CART president Andrew 
Craig. But it won't happen before 2001 and when it does, the series 
is going to have to squeeze it into an already crowded calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest impediment,'' Craig said from CART's headquarters  
in Troy, Mich., ``is sticking it into the number of races. We have 
20 this year, up from 16 only a few years ago, and we have trouble 
finding places on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``The teams are committed and ready to go.''  
</P>
<P>
	Besides the United States and Canada, where 17 of this year's 20  
Indy-car races are staged, CART also runs events in Japan, Brazil, 
and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	To please his sponsors, who provide $430 million to CART, Craig  
would like internationalize his series. Twenty-five percent of the 
sponsors have asked CART to establish a presence in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	That would give Craig's series races on four continents and in  
the countries with the three largest economies: the United States, 
Japan and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	His engine manufacturers -- Honda, Toyota, Ford and Mercedes-Benz  
-- are pushing for a race in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The deciding factor on which country will be first hinges on a  
venue. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the deal struck with the International Automobile  
Federation following the first race in Australia in 1991, CART is 
prohibited from racing on anything but ovals outside North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig says the Lausitz Ring, a 1.5-mile oval about 60 miles  
south of Berlin, is being built by developers in Germany and could 
be ready by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Europe is not accustomed to oval racing, Craig sees  
that as a positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no point in looking like Formula One,'' the  
English-born Craig said. ``We don't want to provide German race 
fans with something they've already got. We bring something they 
haven't seen. And its something American as well, which has an 
intrigue about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most Europeans look upon oval racing with disdain,  
that's it just the business of turning left. But what we have 
found, such as in Japan, is that once they experience it, once they 
see that there is not a bad seat, that they can see every car on 
every lap, for the entire lap, attitudes change rapidly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico, at least, Craig won't have to jump that hurdle.  
</P>
<P>
	Being on the North American continent, CART can stage a road  
race in Mexico and repeat its foray into that market in 1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
	And that is likely what will happen if CART returns, says Craig,  
who says there are ``a couple of tracks quite interested'' from 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	A temporary road course isn't as likely, he says, since that  
involves local governments and control of the course isn't nearly 
as complete and easy as when in a confined area. 
</P>
<P>
	Further complicating matters are the recent talks with the rival  
Indy Racing League, formed in 1995 by Indianapolis Motor Speedway 
owner Tony George when he was rebuffed in his attempt to get more 
influence at CART. 
</P>
<P>
	George complained that CART was too foreign, with more than half  
of its races on road courses and a large number of non-American 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	If the two series merge, the Indianapolis 500 -- which had been  
the unchallenged premier race in the United States -- would return 
to the CART schedule and it would seem likely that the IRL would 
want other races from its calender absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
	That would strain the burgeoning CART schedule even more.  
</P>
<P>
	So how soon could we see Indy-cars in Germany or Mexico?  
</P>
<P>
	``Looking at it right now,'' Craig said, ``I couldn't put a date  
on it.''

<HEADLINE> Police Get Personal in Online Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEESBURG, Va. (AP) -- Go for a walk, drive a car or dance in the  
moonlight and chances are, no one notices. Journey on the Internet 
and a trail is left. 
</P>
<P>
	And police are hot on that trail in a growing number of criminal  
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with search warrants, police are looking into the online  
activities of suspects, and sometimes victims, by seizing evidence 
from Internet service providers and finding material that people 
online never dreamed would end up in the hands of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Private e-mail between lovers. The threatening missives of  
haters. The true identities of people hiding behind screen names in 
a medium they thought was the essence of secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, if you break the law, it can be traced,'' said  
investigator Ron Horack of the Loudoun County, Va., sheriff's 
department. Horack helps police around the country apply for search 
warrants to get material from the county-based America Online, the 
world's largest Internet service provider with 18 million 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know who you are and where you live,'' an anonymous  
hatemonger e-mailed a 12-year-old girl in Lancaster, Pa. By peeking 
into the accounts of Internet providers, police can often say the 
same thing: They know who the threatening people are and where they 
live. 
</P>
<P>
	This week federal authorities said they had charged a northern  
Virginia pediatrician with possessing child pornography after 
investigating his AOL account and finding at least 22 explicit 
images sent to him via e-mail over the course of nearly six months. 
They said they then found more child pornography on his computer. 
The doctor could not immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	With a warrant, law enforcement authorities can look at the  
electronic mail and other online communications of people suspected 
of a range of serious crimes, getting information not just from a 
home computer but often the company that provides the Internet, 
e-mail or chat service. 
</P>
<P>
	They can do the same with victims, in the process seeing mail  
from people who corresponded with them but had nothing to do with a 
crime. Everything from humdrum to-do lists to love letters from 
illicit digital dalliances becomes potential evidence, and 
eventually a matter of public record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a growing risk to privacy,'' said Marc Rotenberg,  
executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, 
who says police should stick to traditional methods such as stings, 
informants and forensic evidence, which don't invade people's 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Horack: ``If they're going to use the Internet for their  
crime, we're going to use the Internet to catch them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities turned to AOL to see some of the online activities  
of the two high school students who killed 13 other people and 
themselves in Littleton, Colo., last month. They've used it to try 
to track down some of the copycat threats that have closed many 
schools since. 
</P>
<P>
	They took the same route, thus far with inconclusive results,  
after a woman in Pennsylvania was told in a chat room, ``I 
guarantee you I will hurt you if you don't listen to me,'' and when 
a man in New York was charged with attempted murder of his wife, 
who, police say, was having a passionate online encounter her 
husband happened to see. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL is extremely law-enforcement friendly,'' Horack said.  
``They don't hold anything back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America Online tells its nearly 18 million customers it won't  
read or disclose private communication or personal identifying 
information except under a ``valid legal process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other major Internet service providers, or ISPs, as well as  
separate online e-mail services and Internet hubs like Hotmail and 
Yahoo, say much the same, although the disclaimers may be hard to 
find in screens of small print. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a long-standing policy of cooperation with law  
enforcement,'' said AOL spokesman Rich D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
	Communications such as e-mail are disclosed only in criminal  
investigations and with a warrant, he says. In response to orders 
in civil cases, AOL may give out information allowing someone's 
real name to be matched to a screen name. 
</P>
<P>
	So if a spouse is found to be having an online affair with  
someone known only as Heart4U, the identity of that cyberlover 
might eventually be uncovered in a divorce proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon Inc. obtained subpoenas to identify 21 people, most of  
them employees, said to have been spreading corporate secrets and 
gripes in an anonymous online chat room. 
</P>
<P>
	It then dropped a lawsuit it had brought against the 21, each  
identified as ``John Doe,'' indicating to privacy experts that the 
company had gone to court in the first place only to learn the 
identities of the chatters. Four employees quit; others entered 
corporate ``counseling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates worry that authorities could go on  
increasingly invasive fishing expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are simply many more events that are recorded (online)  
that would not be recorded in the physical world,'' said Rotenberg. 
``I think it is going to become an enormous problem as people 
become more and more dependent on ISPs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, tools continue to be developed to protect anonymity --  
a site called anonymizer.com, for one, will relay e-mail, stripping 
out the sender's identifying information. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, at least, few warrants going to AOL look like goose  
chases, an impression formed after a review of the more than 100 
that have been filed in Leesburg this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most involve alleged pedophiles, stalkers and harassers who have  
used the Internet to find prey and left evidence of their 
intentions with victims or undercover police. 
</P>
<P>
	Horack prepares warrant applications for police from other parts  
of the country, some so new to digital detective work they need 
their children's help to get online. Once they are approved by a 
magistrate, he takes them to AOL and retrieves the information. 
It's almost a full-time job, offered by the sheriff because the 
company gives such a big boost to the county. 
</P>
<P>
	The warrants are especially effective against child  
pornographers, Horack says. ``Pedophiles are pack rats. They don't 
throw away anything.'' Even when they do delete material from their 
computer, it might be found at the service provider. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of the 12-year-old Pennsylvania girl, nothing turned  
up in the AOL search. Most of the time, something does. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, police in Hendersonville, Tenn., turned to AOL to  
see the Internet activity of Dennis Wayne Cope, 47, shot and found 
dead in a crawl space of his home in February. 
</P>
<P>
	In an affidavit seeking access to Cope's e-mail, ``buddy list  
content'' and other online activities, police said he had been 
corresponding online with the estranged wife of suspect Robert Lee 
Pattee. They also say Pattee's hand print was found at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Pattee has been charged with first-degree murder.

<HEADLINE> Small Businesses Push Tax Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Small-business advocates and their Capitol  
Hill allies lined up Thursday behind Republican legislation that 
would cut taxes $30 billion over five years and include larger 
deductions for health insurance and business meals. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Talent, R-Mo., chairman of the House Small Business  
Committee, said supporters will seek to include the package in the 
larger 10-year, $778 billion tax cut Republicans intend to put 
together this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one-fifth of the tax cut in the budget,'' Talent told  
reporters. ``We don't think that's asking too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would make health insurance costs fully deductible  
for the self-employed next year, instead of 2003 as envisioned in 
current law. It would also increase the meal tax deduction from 50 
percent to 80 percent by 2008, but only for smaller businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The most costly item, at $15 billion over five years, would  
lower from 39.4 percent to 34 percent the top individual income tax 
rate for partnerships, including closely held ones known as S 
corporations, and certain other small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also eliminate a surtax included in employee  
payroll taxes in 1976 to help the government pay back loans for its 
unemployment accounts. Even though the loans were repaid in 1987, 
the surtax remains in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Small businesses, an important constituency for the GOP,  
employee six out of 10 American workers, according to the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce. An estimated 16 million businesses employ 20 
workers or less. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to do everything we can to help small businesses get  
started and prosper, and get the federal government out of their 
way,'' said Rep. Jim DeMint, R-S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other priorities for small business, reducing capital gains  
taxes and abolishing inheritance taxes, were not included in the 
bill but have other champions in Congress who are pushing their 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Ways and Means Committee tentatively is scheduled to  
hold hearings on tax relief proposals the third week of June, an 
aide said Thursday, with legislation expected to begin moving in 
mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans expect President Clinton would veto a massive tax  
cut, but they believe compromise is possible later this year on a 
smaller measure that could include some of the small business 
provisions. White House aides say Clinton could support modest cuts 
that mainly benefit the middle class.

	Serb Gov't Dismisses Indictments  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav government today  
dismissed as a NATO ploy the war crimes indictments of President 
Slobodan Milosevic and four top aides. The opposition party in 
Yugoslavia -- the Democratic Party -- said the indictments for crimes 
against humanity were ill-timed and would undermine the possibility 
of a peace deal. Vladislav Jovanovic, the Yugoslav representative 
to the United Nations in New York, accused the tribunal of blindly 
following the United States and NATO and said the indictment 
undermines efforts to end the conflict. 

</P>
<P>
	NATO Flies Record Number of Sorties  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO aircraft flew a record number of  
airstrikes today against targets in Yugoslavia. The 19-nation 
alliance said it flew 741 sorties on day 64 of its air operation 
against Yugoslavia, including 308 strike sorties and 74 others 
designed to suppress Serb air defenses. A NATO military spokesman 
said alliance forces had observed a major offensive by the rebel 
Kosovo Liberation Army that had pinned down Serb forces in an area 
of western Kosovo. 

</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers Hear Diverse Gun Views  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two parents whose children were slain by  
classmates gave lawmakers diverse views today on whether the 
slayers, guns or lawmakers themselves are to blame for their 
tragedies. Darrell Scott of Littleton, Colo., told the House 
Judiciary Committee's subcommittee that he blames the April 20 
death of his daughter Rachel Joy Scott on Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold. But Byrl Phillips-Taylor of Richmond, Va., placed the 
blame on an AK47 for her son's 1989 death. House Republican leaders 
this week said they support the concept of the gun restrictions 
passed by the Senate, but they rejected demands to quickly 
rubber-stamp the measures.

	Senate Tightens Weapons Lab Security  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today voted to expand congressional  
oversight of technology exports and to tighten security at weapons 
laboratories in the aftermath of a report alleging Chinese 
espionage. The package, added to a $288.8 billion defense spending 
bill, would expand the role of intelligence agencies in reviewing 
export licenses, boost Pentagon monitoring of satellite launches in 
China and require the administration to report to Congress on any 
security breaches.

	Pinochet's Court Bid Fails  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet lost a  
bid today to block his extradition to Spain for a possible trial on 
charges he ordered the torture of political opponents during his 
17-year rule. High Court Judge Harry Ognall refused to give lawyers 
for the 83-year-old general permission to challenge Spain's 
extradition request. British authorities arrested Pinochet in 
October in London at the request of a Spanish judge Baltasar 
Garzon, who wants to try the former Chilean leader for human rights 
abuses committed during his 1973-90 regime.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average fell 235.23, a  
2.2 percent loss, to close at 10,466.93 today. It was the 
ninth-worst one-day point drop ever. But in percentage terms, it 
was far from a record decline. Declining issues on the NYSE led 
advancers 1,936-1,041. The Nasdaq was down 7.98 to 2,419.19. 

</P>

	Longer Trading Approved for Nasdaq  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The National Association of Securities Dealers,  
which governs Nasdaq, today approved a plan to extend trading hours 
from the current 9:30 a.m.-4 p.m. Eastern time schedule. A second 
session of the day would likely start at 5:30 p.m. and end at 9 
p.m. or 10 p.m. The changes are expected to take effect around 
September, after a review by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and discussions with industry leaders.

	'Star Wars' Fans No Fans of Jar-Jar  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Many fans are calling the character Jar Jar  
Binks from the new ``Star Wars'' movie an annoying goofball at best 
and a racial stereotype at worst. Since George Lucas' ``Star Wars: 
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' opened May 19, the Internet has 
been afire with messages calling for no less than the annihilation 
of the creature. By today, the Web site deja.com had amassed 15,000 
messages just about Jar Jar, with many saying they couldn't stand 
him. Jar Jar, a computer-animated character dropped into the frames 
next to the actors, is a bumbling sidekick who says things like 
``yousa'' and ``meesa'' for ``you'' and ``me.''

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt Jr. in Winning Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Early indications are that the $50  
million-plus gamble was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Earnhardt Jr. took an important first step in his Winston  
Cup career by qualifying eighth for his inaugural race, the 
Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Lowe's Motor Speedway at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday night's time trials capped more than six months of  
planning and hoopla surrounding the targeted series debut for the 
24-year-old son of one of the sport's most famous champions. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the relief was evident on the faces of everyone  
associated with the driver known as Little E. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always a gamble because you never know what's going to  
happen,'' said a smiling Ty Norris, general manager of Dale 
Earnhardt Inc. ``But there are certain things that people like Dale 
Earnhardt and his experienced eyes can see, like whether a guy can 
do it or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``And Dale Jr. did not get the opportunity because of his name.  
He has the ability to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch Inc. was banking on it. The brewer, through its  
Budweiser brand, committed to backing the younger Earnhardt's entry 
into Winston Cup racing. Industry sources said the sponsorship 
deal, which runs through the 2004 season, is worth more than $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was for the younger Earnhardt to run five Winston Cup  
races this year before moving up to the circuit on a full-time 
basis in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But what if Earnhardt had struggled?  
</P>
<P>
	``We did not formulate a what-if situation because we just don't  
think that way,'' Norris said. ``And I don't mean to sound cocky or 
anything, but we just don't program ourselves to fail. We try to 
get all the parts together and go out and give it our best shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Earnhardt, the 48-year-old seven-time Winston Cup champion,  
decided last year that his son was capable of making the ascent 
from NASCAR's Busch Grand National circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Historically, that transition hasn't necessarily been an easy  
one. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport's archives are full of drivers who were extremely  
successful in Grand National cars but struggled when they stepped 
up to the top series. Among current drivers alone, David Green, 
Steve Grissom and Joe Nemechek are former Busch series champions 
yet to win Winston Cup race and often struggle just to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Norris said the elder Earnhardt and other officials  
at DEI sensed early in the younger Earnhardt's Grand National days 
that he was something special. The team kept outfitting him with 
old cars and used engines, but Earnhardt kept producing impressive 
finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Further proof of his potential came barely 13 months ago on  
sunny spring afternoon at Texas Motor Speedway. Heading into the 
final lap Earnhardt crept up on the rear bumper of Nemechek, the 
leader, and put an Intimidator-like move on him, weaving quickly to 
create some uncertainty in Nenechek's rearview mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	Nemechek bobbled just momentarily, but it was enough for  
Earnhardt to shoot past and take the checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt went on to win six more times last year and take the  
driving title. He's in a tight battle with Matt Kenseth atop the 
standings one-third of the way through this season. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, he's adding Winston Cup racing to the mix. In addition  
to the added demands on his time, the transition has significantly 
increased the workload for his Grand National team, which also is 
overseeing his limited 1999 Winston Cup program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't really thought that much about the pressure. It's  
just been a lot of hard work,'' crew chief Tony Eury said. ``We've 
still got to concentrate on that Busch championship, but it's a 
relief to get in this race. You can look around here and tell that 
everybody's a lot happier.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Down / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo stock market's main index slipped today  
in light trading as many institutional investors held back to 
assess recent corporate earnings announcements. The dollar edged 
higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.43 yen in the late afternoon, up 0.33 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level 
of 122.17 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 53.33 points,  
or 0.33 percent, closing at 16,177.19. On Wednesday, the average 
gained 16.29 points, or 0.10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Japanese companies have released earnings results for the  
last fiscal year, which ended March 31, with most of them posting 
declined profits amid the nation's worst recession since World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading today was somewhat choppy in the absence of fresh  
market-moving news, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market lacks energy to test higher levels,'' said Kazunori  
Jinnai, deputy general manager of the equity department at Daiwa 
Securities SB Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 396  
million shares, down from Wednesday's turnover of 452 million 
shares. Despite the Nikkei's fall, advancing issues outnumbered 
decliners 621 to 530, with 156 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 1.15 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,302.17 
points. The TOPIX closed down 5.36 points, or 0.41 percent, 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Disappointment that an overnight Wall Street rally did not spark  
a stronger move in Tokyo also pushed the Nikkei index down about 
200 points at one point in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 171.07  
points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,702.16 at Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar drifted higher against the yen  
on buying by Japanese institutional investors and overseas funds 
early in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders said the dollar's upward momentum later petered out  
because players were uncertain about its near-term direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 122.27 yen and 122.74 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 127.58 yen, down  
from 129.36 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.4950 percent from 1.4150 percent late Wednesday, 
driving its price down to 99.17 yen from 99.86 yen.

<HEADLINE> Women Tops at Navy Graduation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Women made up 15 percent of the Naval  
Academy's Class of 1999, but they walked away with more than their 
share of honors. 
</P>
<P>
	The top two graduates and five of the top 10 were women.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the best showing yet for women at the academy, where  
class standing depends on more than just good grades. Academy 
officials also consider military competency and conduct (given 
about 25 percent weight) and athletic achievements (10 percent) to 
determine the order of merit. 
</P>
<P>
	Women may have tried harder ``to show we can succeed in the  
military,'' said Josephine Nguyen, who finished second in the class 
of 868 and will enter medical school at Stanford University in the 
fall with hopes of becoming a Navy flight surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	The top graduate was Mary Godfrey of Dousman, Wis., who was a  
member of the gymnastics team and the glee club. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nguyen, 21, said her decision to enter the Naval Academy was  
influenced by her father, an officer in the South Vietnamese Navy 
before coming to the United States, and her 25-year-old sister, 
Minh-Tu, who also got her degree Wednesday and was commissioned as 
a Marine second lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
	She also was motivated by a sense of duty to her adopted  
country: ``You should give something back to the country which has 
provided so much for your family.''

<HEADLINE> IRL, CART Still Won't Make Nice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	We knew they were good at making war.  
</P>
<P>
	But judging by the way things went Thursday, the bigshots at the  
Indy Racing League and Championship Auto Racing Teams still have a 
lot to learn about making nice. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after reports the rival leagues were holding  
face-to-face talks to bring the biggest names in open-wheel racing 
back to the Indianapolis 500, there was nothing to suggest a 
cease-fire was in place. Just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get allergies in May. Those CART guys get May whine,'' IRL  
executive director Leo Mehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all sitting around their `whine' cellars right now,  
watching 50 hours of live TV from here. They're getting a lot of 
pressure from their sponsors to be at Indy and they see more people 
sitting in Turn 3 than they see at any of their tracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laughable as Mehl's tirade sounded at the start, it got worse.  
</P>
<P>
	``They know that if they come back, everyone gets the same  
engines and the same chassis, and they'll get their doors blown 
off,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly four years, the IRL and CART have shown each other as  
much respect as East Coast and West Coast rappers. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with all the dissing back and forth, no one but Mehl  
would dare say that savvy CART veterans Al Unser Jr. and Michael 
Andretti stay up nights worrying about the likes of Stan Wattles 
... Wim Eyckmans ... Tyce Carlson ... Jeret Schroeder. Nice guys, 
sure, and legitimate qualifiers all, but let's face it; those guys 
are more likely to be polishing the doors of Unser's race car than 
blowing them off. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL guys are so lacking in celebrity that Steve Knapp, last  
year's rookie of the year, thought nothing about approaching the 
league's most recognizable star, Arie Luyendyk, and asking him to 
autograph a racing suit on the first day of practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I thought he was kidding,'' Luyendyk said, ``but he  
was serious. It was a first for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's this revealing tidbit from Tony Stewart, the  
promising youngster who left the IRL for NASCAR. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was born a half-hour from Indy and learned to race in  
open-wheel cars, practically in the shadow of the speedway. This 
year he's going to attempt one of the most intriguing doubles in 
motorsports -- running the Indy 500 in the afternoon, then hopping a 
plane to race in the Coca-Cola 600 in Concord, N.C., that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart is so good he might have a shot at winning both. He won  
three races during his brief IRL stay and led the Indy 500 in all 
three previous tries, finishing second in 1997. But when someone 
asked what would happen if he got squeezed for time, Stewart's 
answer said it all: 
</P>
<P>
	He'd leave Indy early -- even if he were leading with five laps  
to go. 
</P>
<P>
	And that tells you why the IRL and CART will finally put their  
differences aside and make Indy -- the Humpty Dumpty of open-wheel 
racing -- whole again. 
</P>
<P>
	When Indianapolis Motor Speedway boss and IRL founder Tony  
George chased the CART people away from his track, he said they'd 
never prosper without the prestige of the Indy 500. On their way 
out of town, CART kingpins like Roger Penske and Andrew Craig said 
the race would be diminished without the credibility the best 
drivers and teams bring to the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were right. It took them nearly four years and wasted  
millions to realize it. The lingering bitterness is why George, in 
acknowledging that negotiations were under way, said, ``I can't say 
I'm encouraged by anything we talked about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A merger made sense as a business decision within the first year  
after the split. Since then, the IRL and CART have been fighting 
over a steadily declining number of sponsors and fans interested in 
open-wheel racing. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporations and crowds that used to follow either league  
increasingly are looking in the direction of NASCAR. There, without 
competition, and with all the cooperation he could ever want, Bill 
France Jr., adds pieces to his $2 billion-a-year empire almost at 
will. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's the real reason why this deal will get done.  
</P>
<P>
	France, said to be brokering the IRL-CART peace talks, is also  
boss of the International Speedway Corp., which just bought Penske 
Motorsports. Included in the package were 10 racetracks, with at 
least three more planned in the near future. He already has IRL 
racing at a few other sites. 
</P>
<P>
	With George at one elbow and Penske at the other, he can wrap  
his arms around both and knock their heads together until they come 
to their senses. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Reform Jews OK Traditional Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The rabbis of Judaism's liberal Reform branch are moving into  
the 21st century by looking backward for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	At an annual convention that concluded Wednesday in Pittsburgh,  
the Central Conference of American Rabbis ratified a new 
``Statement of Principles'' that would be barely recognizable to 
the rabbinical framers of the Reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
	It emphasizes the importance of studying Hebrew and the value of  
tradition. For some, that might mean a return to such practices 
such as wearing yarmulkes or keeping kosher. 
</P>
<P>
	At its inception in 1885, the platform for the Reform branch  
spurned Zionism and rejected Jewish ceremonial laws that the rabbis 
considered not in keeping with ``the views and habits of modern 
civilization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traditions that regulated diet, ritual purity and dress were  
``entirely foreign to our present mental and spiritual state,'' 
Reform's founders declared. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 statement is not binding, so each Reform Jew will  
decide how much of the tradition to adopt. But the text from the 
governing body of the biggest and most liberal major branch of 
American Jewry clearly reflects trends among Reform Jews, and 
American Jews in general. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reform Judaism in its early years was trying to accommodate  
modern society by Protestantizing Judaism,'' said Judith Plaskow, a 
professor of religious studies at Manhattan College who is Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
	``We who grew up in classical Reform congregations were deprived  
of a lot of Jewish knowledge and ritual that could have enriched 
our lives. There is increasing recognition of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis Rivkin, professor emeritus of Jewish history at Reform's  
Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, said tradition provides younger 
Jews a sense of security in an era when they feel threatened by 
assimilation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They fear there might be a dissolution of Judaism because of  
its openness to the world at large,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Conference of American Rabbis has 1.5 million  
members, but the total number of Reform Jews is difficult to 
estimate because many aren't associated with a synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the debate at the conference concerned the policy on  
marriage to non-Jews. Some participants were concerned that the 
section could be interpreted as condoning intermarriage, when their 
intent was instead to welcome non-Jews who are willing to convert. 
</P>
<P>
	In Israel, Rabbi Avraham Ravitz of the strictly Orthodox United  
Torah Judaism party, dismissed the new Statement of Principles as 
``just words.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement will mean something, he said, when Reform Jews  
``return to observing mitzvot,'' the Hebrew word for deeds 
prescribed by religious law. 
</P>
<P>
	Ravitz also said Reform's shift will not affect the rancorous  
``who-is-a-Jew'' debate in Israel -- and won't change the fact that 
conversions conducted by Reform rabbis do not meet traditional 
requirements of Jewish law. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a Hasidic rabbi in Boston, Shmuel Posner, considers the  
Reform platform ``a tremendous vindication. Judaism is Judaism. You 
can't reform it, reconstruct it, conserve it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Combines Work And Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- So far during his vacation, President Clinton  
has played golf, ridden bikes with his wife -- and tried to keep 
tabs on the NATO mission in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton received his daily security briefing on the military  
campaign Wednesday and also made phone calls to Italian Prime 
Minister Massimo D'Alema and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and D'Alema spent 30 minutes discussing NATO airstrikes  
against the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. The 
president asked Weisel, a Holocaust survivor and author, to travel 
to Macedonia on May 31 as a special envoy to check on refugees from 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to get a sense of the conditions there and have a  
chance to talk to some of the refugees about the conditions on the 
ground,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. Wiesel will 
report back directly to Clinton after his trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Any president vacationing during a military conflict opens  
himself to questions about priorities. President Bush was 
criticized for going to his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, 
during the Persian Gulf buildup in 1991. But he told reporters, 
``What you don't want to do is appear to be held hostage in the 
White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Clinton sped away from his Martha's Vineyard  
vacation to return to Washington to preside over a U.S. strike on 
suspected terrorist strongholds in Afghanistan and Sudan. In this 
case, Lockhart said Clinton remains in close contact with his 
aides, and is not concerned that it may appear he is being too laid 
back during the ongoing NATO mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important from time to time to take a chance to get  
away,'' Lockhart said. ``I don't think there's any worry on our 
part about the appearances here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's vacation was planned long before a report on China's  
espionage was released Tuesday by a special committee led by Reps. 
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., and Norman Dicks, D-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jim Nicholson, the Republican National Committee chairman,  
said through a spokesman that it was appropriate Clinton was 
vacationing at a nature preserve: ``He's joining the ostriches with 
his head in the sand the day after the Cox committee exposed the 
worst case of espionage in U.S. history under his watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has stressed that most of the spying detailed in  
the report occurred in the 1980s, when Republicans held the 
presidency, and Lockhart noted that Clinton spoke about the report 
Tuesday in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived Tuesday at  
the private wildlife conservation area, off an unmarked dirt road 
about 20 miles north of Jacksonville. They are staying in a 
two-story, five-bedroom house with cedar panels. 
</P>
<P>
	The president brought a bagful of books to help pass the time,  
including ``Sudden Mischief'' by Robert Parker and Carl Hiassen's 
``Lucky You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the White House said Clinton will address the  
International Labor Organization in Geneva on June 16. The address 
will be the first by a U.S. president to the international body of 
government ministers and the leaders of unions and business 
associations around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said the ILO speech will offer a deeper  
explanation of Clinton's views on trade and policy proposals to 
protect workers. The ILO, founded 1919, operates on the basis of 
consensus and often is seen as a weak enforcer of international 
labor standards.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Kept Up To Date on Vacation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- So far during his vacation, President Clinton  
has played golf, ridden bikes with his wife -- and tried to keep 
tabs on the NATO mission in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The news that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was indicted  
by a war-crimes tribunal drew Clinton out of the house on the White 
Oak nature preserve -- but only as far as the driveway's edge. Clad 
in a blue blazer, yellow tie and khakis, Clinton said the 
indictment ``speaks to the world'' that the NATO mission in Kosovo 
is just. Then he climbed into his sport utility vehicle and rode 
back to his cottage.

<HEADLINE>  Discovery Departs For Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery blasted off  
for the new international space station today, ending NASA's 
six-month launch drought, the longest since the Challenger 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a long time,'' launch director Ralph Roe said once  
Discovery was safely in orbit. ``We're all just extremely happy to 
be launching again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.5 million-pound ship, carrying seven astronauts and a full  
load of space station supplies, blazed into a hazy sky at 6:49 a.m. 
as a brilliant yellow sun emerged above the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	The space station was soaring 235 miles over the Atlantic, due  
east of the Carolinas, when Discovery took off in pursuit. They're 
due to link up early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Because a space shuttle hadn't flown since December, NASA was  
especially vigilant during launch preparations. The six-month gap 
between missions had nothing to do with the fleet, but rather a 
critical space station component that Russia keeps delaying and a 
NASA X-ray telescope that's grounded because of ongoing problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The only major problem in the past month was hail, which  
pummeled Discovery's giant fuel tank and forced a one-week delay. 
Speckled with patches, the tank dropped away, its job done, as 
Discovery slipped into orbit eight minutes after liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery holds more than 4,300 pounds of spare parts, tools,  
laptop computers and clothes for the station's first permanent 
residents, due to move in early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	During their 10-day mission, Discovery's astronauts will not  
only haul supplies into the space station, they will also fix 
broken U.S. and Russian equipment and install mufflers to reduce 
the noise caused by clattering Russian fans. Two of them will also 
take a spacewalk this weekend to attach one crane and parts of 
another to the outside of the station. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first flight to the station since shuttle astronauts  
took up the second component in December and attached it to the 
first, which was already in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, commander Kent Rominger and his  
U.S.-Canadian-Russian crew will be the first to dock with the 
complex. Rominger, a Navy pilot, will pull up and dock the same way 
it was done during the shuttle-Mir program. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, an unmanned Russian rocket is scheduled to launch  
the next piece of the space station, a service module containing 
life-support systems. Then, NASA's space shuttle Atlantis is 
supposed to follow in December with more equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	However, everything is on hold until the Russian component --  
already more than 1 1/2 years behind -- is in orbit. And many question 
whether the Russians can finish building and testing it by 
November, given the country's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	This service module, in large part, caused the six-month gap in  
shuttle launches. The fleet was grounded for more than 2 1/2 years 
following the 1986 Challenger accident. 
</P>
<P>
	To stay sharp, NASA's launch team conducted extra countdown  
practices during the hiatus and spent extra time reviewing 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	It paid off. Discovery's virtually flawless climb to orbit was a  
bright spot amid a number of recent failed launches of unmanned 
rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Three satellites ended up in useless orbits and another was  
vaporized shortly after launch, all since April. In addition, two 
satellites were destroyed in launch explosions last August. None of 
the six satellites belonged to the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did not bother me, although I sensed in the surrounding  
community there was a heightened expectation, or a heightened 
awareness of the potential for failure,'' said Donald McMonagle, a 
launch manager. ``But I'm very happy to say we have, in fact, a 
good vehicle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery is due back June 6.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Warn of Chinese Backlash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chief author of the House report detailing  
alleged Chinese espionage and the House's only Chinese-American 
lawmaker joined Thursday in urging Americans not to use the case as 
a reason to discriminate against Chinese and other Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is just as anti-American to be racist as it is to commit  
espionage,'' said Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., whose special 
panel this week issued a report describing several decades of 
Chinese efforts to obtain and steal U.S. nuclear weapons secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox backed a resolution introduced by Rep. David Wu, D-Ore., the  
House's first Chinese-American, stating that it was wrong for 
Congress and Americans to stereotype people based on the actions of 
any individual. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be sure that no one is unfairly vilified'' as a  
result of the charges against the Chinese government and the 
suspicions that a Chinese-American scientist at the Los Alamos 
nuclear weapons laboratory supplied China with nuclear secrets, Wu 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wu co-sponsored the measure with Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif.,  
who said Chinese-Americans in his Silicon Valley district are 
keeping a low profile for fear of retribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the House Democratic whip, said  
his office was receiving a disturbing number of anti-Asian phone 
calls, a trend that ``must be tackled and nipped at the bud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Patsy Mink, D-Hawaii, an American of Japanese descent, said  
other Chinese-Americans in top security jobs are ``expressing 
extreme discomfort in the way they are being treated'' because of 
the Chinese spying case. 
</P>
<P>
	Since charges arose that the Chinese tried to make illegal  
contributions to President Clinton's re-election campaign, she 
said, her office has received harassing phone calls when she speaks 
on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox accused the Beijing government of enflaming tensions between  
the Chinese and American people with propaganda saying the 
espionage charges were based on anti-Chinese racism. ``It is a 
horrible thing for the Chinese government to whip up.''

<HEADLINE> AL Suspends Ramirez, Nitkowski </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cleveland outfielder Manny Ramirez and Detroit  
pitcher C.J. Nitkowski, the two players ejected during last week's 
beanball battle at Jacobs Field, were suspended and fined Thursday 
by AL president Gene Budig. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, leading the majors with 59 RBIs, is to start a  
three-game suspension Friday against Boston. Nitkowski is to begin 
a two-game suspension Friday against Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on whether either player would  
appeal the penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Jaret Wright of Cleveland and manager Larry Parrish and  
pitcher Jeff Weaver of Detroit also were fined undisclosed amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	And in an unusual step, Budig announced his intention to talk to  
Wright and Indians manager Mike Hargrove about Wright's 
``deportment on the mound'' when Cleveland visits New York next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us wants to see Jaret told how to pitch,'' Indians  
general manager John Hart said. ``He pitches inside and will 
continue to so do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble at Jacobs Field last Saturday began when Wright --  
suspended for five games in April and fined $1,000 after hitting a 
Boston batter with a pitch following a home run -- nailed Detroit's 
Tony Clark in the batting helmet with a fastball in the top of the 
sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	In the bottom of the sixth, Ramirez charged Weaver after being  
hit in the helmet with a pitch, setting off a bench-clearing brawl. 
During the fracas, Parrish wrestled down Wright from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams were warned against further trouble. In the eighth,  
Nitkowski was ejected when his first -- and only -- pitch knocked 
Kenny Lofton to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American League this year has suspended only players who  
were ejected by umpires,'' Budig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish said he had not expected a fine, but ``I don't know that  
it's anything I'd fight, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Nitkowski, he said, ``He's the one suspended who wasn't  
throwing at anybody, for sure. But it happened after he'd been 
warned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez is batting .348 with 13 home runs.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think in Manny's case, obviously Manny was hit  
deliberately,'' Hart said. ``It was retaliation of some sort and 
Manny reacted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nitkowski is 1-1 with a 5.50 ERA in 27 relief appearances.

	``Every one of those pitches was an accident, whether anybody  
wants to believe it or not. Especially mine,'' Nitkowski said. 
``Anybody who knows my history will tell you that location isn't my 
long suit.''

	``If I get two, how come Ramirez only gets three? I think that's  
pretty weak,'' he said. ``The fines better be in proportion -- what 
my salary is and what his salary is.''

	Hart said he spoke with Budig couple of times this week.

	``I was hoping for some leniency and obviously none was given.  
In our situation, all you can do is grind your teeth. I don't think 
it was overly fair,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart also spoke to Budig about Parrish's involvement in the  
brawl ``and I told him I didn't think that was appropriate.''

<HEADLINE> Oaklanders Fly Flag for Pride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Finally, there is a there there in  
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	It's up there in black and white, for anyone to see, flying from  
the top of the city's refurbished landmark, the Oakland Tribune 
tower. 
</P>
<P>
	To counter Gertrude Stein's legendary and often misinterpreted  
line about the city of her youth, a white flag with the word THERE 
in black capital letters now flies over the 21-story building. 
</P>
<P>
	John Protopappas, a developer, arranged to have it put there.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oaklanders understand what she meant,'' he said. ``It's the  
non-Oaklanders that have played up her words.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disputed phrase came from Stein's 1937 ``Everybody's  
Autobiography'' and described her despair upon finding that her 
childhood home had been razed. Also gone were the rose bushes that 
inspired the line ``a rose is a rose is a rose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With her usual idiosyncratic punctuation, she wrote: ``Anyway  
what was the use of my having come from Oakland. It was not natural 
to have come from there yes write about it if I like or anything if 
I like but not there there is no there there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protopappas said he's hoping others in Oakland pick up his  
banner, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice to be driving around downtown and see a bunch  
of `There' flags,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Haggles on HMO Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Partisan maneuvering over patient rights  
legislation continued this week as House Democrats took the first 
step toward forcing a vote on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, meanwhile, bipartisan talks toward compromise  
legislation broke down as lawmakers looked to a long Memorial Day 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats said they had ``little choice'' other than to  
start collecting names on a discharge petition, which would pull 
the popular legislation out of committee and move it directly to 
the House floor. The petition would need 218 signatures -- a 
majority of the House -- to force a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have repeatedly asked the majority for a commitment to  
schedule managed care reform for a vote,'' Rep. John Dingell, 
D-Mich., said Thursday. ``If the leadership is unwilling to 
schedule a vote, they'll have to explain for themselves exactly why 
they are running scared from the electorate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell cited a May 11 letter in which Commerce Committee  
Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va., suggested he would hold hearings 
throughout the summer but did not promise a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., accused Dingell of  
politicizing the issue with the petition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a disappointing maneuver that tells me the Democrat  
leadership has more interest in playing partisan political games 
than in enacting real reform,'' said Hastert, who has promised a 
vote this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliley ``has given public and private assurances'' that the  
committee will debate the issue, said his spokeswoman Christina 
Gungoll, though he has not set a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, there was a similar effort to force a vote on the  
issue, but Republicans brought it to the floor on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, talks have broken down between Sen. William Roth,  
R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee, and Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan of New York, the committee's top Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agreement is not possible at this time,'' Roth said in a  
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Their staffs had been working since February to fashion a  
compromise, but this week, Moynihan walked away, saying little 
progress had been made and there were other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	A committee spokeswoman, Ginny Flynn, said Republicans thought  
they were ``pretty close'' to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt that it was premature for them to walk away,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee has  
already approved along party lines a GOP patient rights bill. But 
the Finance Committee is responsible for tax-related portions of 
the legislation, including Republican priorities that are 
tangential to patient protections, such as expanding medical 
savings accounts.

<HEADLINE>  Discovery Departs For Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery blasted off  
for the new international space station today, ending NASA's 
six-month launch drought, the longest since the Challenger 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a long time,'' launch director Ralph Roe said once  
Discovery was safely in orbit. ``We're all just extremely happy to 
be launching again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.5 million-pound ship, carrying seven astronauts and a full  
load of space station supplies, blazed into a hazy sky at 6:49 a.m. 
as a brilliant yellow sun emerged above the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	The space station was soaring 235 miles over the Atlantic, due  
east of the Carolinas, when Discovery took off in pursuit. They're 
due to link up early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Because a space shuttle hadn't flown since December, NASA was  
especially vigilant during launch preparations. The six-month gap 
between missions had nothing to do with the fleet, but rather a 
critical space station component that Russia keeps delaying and a 
NASA X-ray telescope that's grounded because of ongoing problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The only major problem in the past month was hail, which  
pummeled Discovery's giant fuel tank and forced a one-week delay. 
Speckled with patches, the tank dropped away, its job done, as 
Discovery slipped into orbit eight minutes after liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery holds more than 4,300 pounds of spare parts, tools,  
laptop computers and clothes for the station's first permanent 
residents, due to move in early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	During their 10-day mission, Discovery's astronauts will not  
only haul supplies into the space station, they will also fix 
broken U.S. and Russian equipment and install mufflers to reduce 
the noise caused by clattering Russian fans. Two of them will also 
take a spacewalk this weekend to attach one crane and parts of 
another to the outside of the station. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first flight to the station since shuttle astronauts  
took up the second component in December and attached it to the 
first, which was already in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, commander Kent Rominger and his  
U.S.-Canadian-Russian crew will be the first to dock with the 
complex. Rominger, a Navy pilot, will pull up and dock the same way 
it was done during the shuttle-Mir program. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, an unmanned Russian rocket is scheduled to launch  
the next piece of the space station, a service module containing 
life-support systems. Then, NASA's space shuttle Atlantis is 
supposed to follow in December with more equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	However, everything is on hold until the Russian component --  
already more than 1 1/2 years behind -- is in orbit. And many question 
whether the Russians can finish building and testing it by 
November, given the country's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	This service module, in large part, caused the six-month gap in  
shuttle launches. The fleet was grounded for more than 2 1/2 years 
following the 1986 Challenger accident. 
</P>
<P>
	To stay sharp, NASA's launch team conducted extra countdown  
practices during the hiatus and spent extra time reviewing 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	It paid off. Discovery's virtually flawless climb to orbit was a  
bright spot amid a number of recent failed launches of unmanned 
rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Three satellites ended up in useless orbits and another was  
vaporized shortly after launch, all since April. In addition, two 
satellites were destroyed in launch explosions last August. None of 
the six satellites belonged to the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did not bother me, although I sensed in the surrounding  
community there was a heightened expectation, or a heightened 
awareness of the potential for failure,'' said Donald McMonagle, a 
launch manager. ``But I'm very happy to say we have, in fact, a 
good vehicle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery is due back June 6.

<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery was loaded  
and ready to take off for the new international space station 
today, six months after astronauts last visited the outpost. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew of seven waved and smiled broadly while boarding the  
4.5 million-pound spaceship. Liftoff was scheduled for just after

<P>
	``Mother Nature has already left her mark on this mission, so  
we're expecting that all the weather delays are behind us,'' Air 
Force weatherman Clif Stargardt said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mavericks Give Trent Maui Vacation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Mavericks can't pay Gary Trent more  
than $5 million over two years. They can't guarantee him a shot at 
the NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
	They can, however, offer him fun in the sun.  
</P>
<P>
	Trent, his fiancee, infant son, parents and future mother-in-law  
are off to Maui for a week of entertainment courtesy of the 
Mavericks. Dallas hopes the goodwill gesture will convince him to 
re-sign with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to rub his belly and let him know we love him,''  
Mavericks general manager-coach Don Nelson told The Dallas Morning 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8, 250-pound forward signed a one-year deal with  
Dallas after the lockout and had the kind of season expected when 
he was a lottery pick four years ago: 16 points and 7.8 rebounds 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Trent, who finished third in voting for the Most Improved Player  
award, could cash in when he becomes a free agent July 1. The 
Mavericks are trying to take advantage of the fact they have 
exclusive negotiating rights until then. 
</P>
<P>
	``My opinion hasn't changed; there's no better place for Gary  
Trent than right here,'' Nelson said. ``I'll keep trying to 
convince him of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teams usually can offer their own players longterm deals without  
salary-cap restraints, but Trent must be on the roster two more 
years for that option. As a result, other teams with more money 
available under the cap can offer him more lucrative deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who has a home in Maui, called the team's unique  
approach ``recruiting with no rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You name it, and we're doing it,'' Nelson said. ``But I ain't  
getting on that fishing boat. I get sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard Steve Nash said he's glad the team is being  
proactive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God somebody is doing something about keeping him,''  
Nash said. ``We need him.''

<HEADLINE> Homeschooled Boy Wins Geography Bee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Much of what David Beihl has learned about the  
world, he's learned at home. Those lessons paid off when he became 
the first homeschooled student to win the National Geography Bee. 
</P>
<P>
	He won Wednesday by correctly answering that ``La Nina'' is the  
Spanish name for the weather condition characterized by unusually 
cold ocean temperatures in the equatorial region of the eastern 
Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had lots of time to study. My schedule is more flexible  
than some other schools,'' said David, 13, of Saluda, S.C., He has 
been taught at home since kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
	David's brother, Tom, 11, and sister, Debbie, 9, are also taught  
at home by their mother, Penny Beihl, 39, who has a master's degree 
in elementary and secondary education. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live way out in the country,'' said his father, Gary Beihl,  
39, who commutes an hour each way to his engineering job with Intel 
in Columbia, S.C. ``It makes us closer as a family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David outlasted Jason Borschow, a 13-year-old eighth-grader at  
Saint John's School in Condado, just outside San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
Jason answered ``El Nino,'' to the weather question in the 
championship round of the National Geographic Society's nationwide 
geography competition. However, the word's male gender 
characterizes warm weather conditions, said moderator Alex Trebek, 
who usually serves as host of the television game show 
``Jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be calm and not blurt the answer out. You have to  
take your time and consider all the possibilities,'' said Jason, a 
three-time finalist who admitted that in the end he did not follow 
his own advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Jason and David were returning participants to the annual  
competition. Jason represented Puerto Rico last year and in 1997. 
David represented South Carolina last year. 
</P>
<P>
	They were among the 10 to make the finals Wednesday in the 11th  
annual competition at the society's Washington headquarters. The 
field was narrowed from 55 on Tuesday. Each contestant represented 
fourth- to eighth-graders from each state, the District of 
Columbia, Department of Defense Schools and each of the five U.S. 
territories. More than 5 million students ages 10 to 15 competed in 
their schools and states earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	David received a $25,000 scholarship from the society and a  
seven-day trip to Sydney, Australia, from this year's corporate 
sponsor, Bank One. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason got a $15,000 scholarship for second place. Tanveer Ali,  
13, an eighth-grader from Flint, Mich., won $10,000 for his 
third-place finish. He attends Carman-Ainsworth Junior High School 
in Flint. 
</P>
<P>
	David correctly answered all three championship round questions,  
while his opponent answered just two. In addition to the La Nina 
question, David correctly answered ``Dhaka'' when asked, ``In 1998, 
a bridge across the Jamuna River was completed about 65 miles 
northwest of what capital city?'' Dhaka is the capital of 
Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
	And he accurately responded, ``Honduras,'' when quizzed on which  
Central American country is the only one with direct access to the 
Pacific Ocean through the Gulf of Fonseca. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always makes us sweat bullets,'' joked Gary Beihl, who  
attributed the success of his son to homeschooling. David will 
remain in Washington for next week's Scripps Howard National 
Spelling Bee. A 13-year-old New York girl educated at home won the 
spelling bee in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The geography bee's final contest was close as many of the  
youngsters answered several questions before being eliminated. At 
one point, Trebek joked that he would run out of questions before 
contestants. 
</P>
<P>
	The other finalists from Wednesday's rounds received $500.

<HEADLINE> N.Y., Calif. Transit Aid May Be Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pitting two of the biggest states against the  
rest of the country, a Senate committee voted Thursday to cut 
federal mass transit aid to California and New York and distribute 
the money among the 48 other states instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision was included in a $49 billion transportation bill  
for the coming fiscal year that the Senate Appropriations Committee 
approved, 27-1. The sole dissenting vote was cast by Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein, D-Calif., because of the transit provision. New York has 
no senators on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations transportation subcommittee approved  
its own $50.7 billion bill Thursday without any similar limits on 
how mass transit money is distributed to states. That means there 
is a good chance the Senate language will not make it into a 
compromise House-Senate bill later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial language would limit each state to no more  
than 12.5 percent of $5.1 billion in federal mass transit spending. 
Last year, only two states exceeded that figure: New York's 15.9 
percent, or $813 million, and California's 13.6 percent, or $696 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein said that under the proposal, which in the bill is  
called the transit equity provision, California could lose $117 
million next year and New York $160 million. She noted that 
together, the two states have nearly half the nation's transit 
riders: New York has 34 percent, and California has 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill contains a transit equity provision which, in my  
view, is anything but,'' Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate  
Appropriations transportation subcommittee, defended the proposal. 
He said he was protecting smaller states from the big states' 
ever-growing use of the transit funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted  
Stevens, R-Alaska, White House budget director Jacob Lew said the 
administration ``strongly opposes'' the state limits on transit 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting a larger fight between the White House and Congress  
over proposed spending, the letter also said the bill's overall 
price tag is ``simply inadequate to make the necessary investments 
that our citizens need and expect.'' The letter, however, did not 
threaten a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby did drop provisions he had included earlier this week  
that would require airlines to give passengers more information 
about bargain fares and expected late arrivals. He said he would 
watch voluntary efforts by the airlines to improve information 
provided to passengers and might revive the provisions later. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby said he eliminated the language after being lobbied so  
heavily this week by the airline industry that ``it felt like my 
office was a chalet at the Paris air show,'' an annual event 
heavily attended by airline company representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate panel also approved a $21.6 billion energy and water  
projects bill that would increase spending for security at Energy 
Department facilities in the wake of revelations of Chinese spying. 
It would also cut administration requests for improving water 
quality in the San Francisco Bay area and Florida's Everglades.

<HEADLINE> Court Blocks Another EPA Smog Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time in two weeks, the  
Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday lost a federal court 
challenge to key air pollution requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the  
District of Columbia ordered the agency to stop moving ahead with a 
regulation requiring 22 states to work to reduce the amount of 
smog-causing chemicals drifting to other states. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges said the regulation must remain on hold pending  
further court action in a lawsuit by a number of Midwest states and 
utilities that operate dirtier coal-burning power plants in the 
Ohio Valley and elsewhere. The court did not address the 
regulation's merit. 
</P>
<P>
	The action means the 22 states, from Michigan to Maine, will not  
have to submit plans in September describing how they intend to 
reduce the interstate transport of pollution. The actual pollution 
reductions are not expected to be required until 2003 and, in some 
cases, 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA said the judges' order was a ``procedural delay'' that  
``temporarily delays these important health protection for the 
American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The regulation, announced by the EPA last October, most directly  
would affect coal-burning power plants in the Ohio Valley and 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists have argued those plants produce large amounts  
of nitrogen oxide that eventually drifts to the Northeast as smog, 
making it difficult for Northeast states to comply with federal air 
quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Midwest states and the utilities have argued the  
long-range transport problem has been exaggerated. But EPA has 
found it significant and a contributor to the urban smog problems 
across much of the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges in the case are Douglas H. Ginsburg, Stephen F.  
Williams and Judith W. Rogers. Ginsburg and Williams were on the 
three-judge panel that on May 14 overturned the EPA's requirement 
for tougher air quality health standards to control soot and smog. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's administrator, Carol Browner, said that ruling was  
``bizarre'' and ``illogical,'' and the administration planned an 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22 states subject to the October regulation are: Alabama,  
Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, 
North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, 
Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island, while subject to the rule, would not have to make  
additional reductions because it already meets the EPA requirement. 
The amount of reductions that would be required of the others 
states vary widely; the deepest reductions generally apply to 
states with concentrations of older coal burning power plants.

<HEADLINE> Mars Shown To Be Pear-Shaped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A global study of Mars shows that the red  
planet is shaped like a pear, with towering volcanic mountains in 
the south, and a smooth lowland in the north that may once have 
been an ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-dimensional map of Mars, drawn from measurements taken  
by the Mars Global Surveyor program, shows that the planet is a 
land of extremes, with the highest, lowest and smoothest land forms 
found in the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
	There's about 19 to 20 miles difference between the highest and  
the lowest points on Mars, about 1 1/2 times the range of elevation 
seen on Earth, said David Smith, a NASA scientist and the lead 
author of a study appearing Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said that an asteroid or other space rock smashed into  
Mars billions of years ago, blasted out a crater deeper than Mount 
Everest is high. 
</P>
<P>
	The crater, called Hellas, is deeper than any other in the solar  
system, said Smith. If it had been gouged out of the United States, 
he said, it could stretch from the East Coast to the Rocky 
Mountains -- about 1,500 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The rock and dust blasted from the crater would be enough to  
cover the United States with a blanket up to two miles thick, Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other extreme is a volcanic mountain, called Olympus  
Mons, that soars almost 17 miles above the average elevation of 
Mars, making it the highest volcano in the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northern hemisphere, there is a huge basin that dips down  
to about six miles below the average elevation of Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Zuber, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of  
Technology and a co-author of the mapping project, said the basin 
``is consistent with the formation of a past ocean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether or not Mars ever had enough water to fill such a basin  
is still unconfirmed, she said, although the area is smooth and 
featureless, as if sea lapped for an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The north basin is the smoothest surface known in the solar  
system,'' said Zuber. ``Any water on Mars would have flowed into 
the area that is low and smooth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this, she said, ``we have not detected any beach  
feature,'' or area that appears to have once been the edge of an 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Zuber said Mars probably has quite a bit of water, trapped  
beneath the north and south poles as ice. She estimated that the 
combined deposits of water at the two poles would equal about 1.5 
times the water frozen in the glaciers and lakes of Greenland. 
</P>
<P>
	That quantity, said Zuber, would equal about 40 percent of the  
amount of liquid water estimated to have once flowed on Mars. She 
said much of this water was probably ``lost to space'' over the 4 
billion-year history of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	Data for the Mars map was collected by an instrument called the  
Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter. The device aboard the orbiting Global 
Surveyor spacecraft zapped the Martian surface with a laser beam 
and then calculated the time for the light to bounce back to a 
receiver. The device uses this time interval to determine how far 
the light traveled and, thus, the elevation of the surface below. 
The accuracy was estimated at six feet over flat, smooth surfaces, 
and about 42 feet elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 27 million measurements were taken for the current  
map, but Smith said that the map will be refined further because 
the instruments are still taking readings. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said that data from the evolving map will be used to find  
future Mars landing sites for robot spacecraft. The first use will 
probably come in 2003 when a lander is set to touch down near the 
south pole.

<HEADLINE> French Favorite Mauresmo Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- One day after her loss to Martina Hingis, Amelie  
Mauresmo left the French Open in a wheelchair on Thursday after 
spraining her left ankle while playing doubles with Julie Halard 
Decugis. 
</P>
<P>
	The match against Jana Novotna and Natasha Zvereva had been tied  
at 4-4 in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STRANGE GIFT:* Ball boys and girls at Roland Garros got a  
surprise Thursday when a player left them underwear. 
</P>
<P>
	After her match against Ai Sugiyama, Italian Silvia Farina gave  
away some clothing to the ball boys and girls. 
</P>
<P>
	When the ball boys opened the package they found not only a  
T-shirt and some shorts but also panties and a bra. They brought 
the underwear to the lost and found. The other clothing was kept 
and will be given away to ball boys and girls in a lottery at the 
end of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SAY YES TO DRUG TESTING:* Steffi Graf spoke out in favor of  
more rigorous drug testing at the French Open. Graf is also in 
favor of testing during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (drug testing) is something that needs to be done a  
lot stricter,'' she said. ``The other thing is, so far I've only 
heard of drug testing during tournaments, and I've never heard of 
it off tournaments or during training season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf said she felt that the women's tour should follow the lead  
of Olympic sports that have off-season drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1993 French Open, Graf told reporters that she hadn't  
been tested for drugs on the tour for eight years. On Thursday, she 
said that had changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's maybe two or three times a year now,'' Graf said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SOUND ADVICE:* During her match against the No. 2-seeded  
Lindsay Davenport, 16-year-old Justine Henin got some good tips 
from the supportive French audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make her run !'' spectators rooting for the Belgian shouted.  
</P>
<P>
	Henin said afterwards that she should have listened. ``It was  
probably good advice,'' she said. ``I should have made her run 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henin lost in three sets to Davenport in three sets, who was  
quick to praise her opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone that can play that type of game definitely has a great  
future,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WILLIAMS RELAX:* The Williams sisters took advantage of the  
lovely weather in Paris to enjoy an early sunbath with some ball 
boys Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	When Venus and Serena passed by the Suzanne Lenglen court, they  
saw some ball boys resting on the grass. The sisters decided to 
take a little break and join them. The ball boys were very taken 
with the friendly attitude of the sisters.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Man Charged With Hate Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) -- A white man accused of driving onto a  
sidewalk to hit two black teen-agers on bikes has been charged with 
attempted murder and ordered to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	James G. Langenbach, 27, intentionally swerved his car and sped  
toward the 14-year-old boys as they rode their bicycles May 16, 
police allege. 
</P>
<P>
	A man riding a motorcycle behind Langenbach's car testified at a  
preliminary hearing Wednesday that he saw the car swerve up the 
curb and on the sidewalk about 30 feet behind the boys. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, it was floored,'' Dino Gigliotti said  
Wednesday. ``He accelerated all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charges were upgraded Wednesday to two counts each of attempted  
murder while armed with a dangerous weapon, causing great bodily 
harm to a child with a dangerous weapon and leaving the scene of an 
injury accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The new charges also include a hate crime provision, which can  
add up to five years in prison and $5,000 in fines to each charge. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Langenbach faces 120 years in prison on the  
attempted murder charges, 60 years on the assault charges and 16 
years on the flight charges. 
</P>
<P>
	One boy has been released from the hospital. The other was in  
satisfactory condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Langenbach has a history of run-ins with police and has been  
treated for psychiatric problems, records show. He had been placed 
on probation for ramming his car into a van carrying five black men 
eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Langenbach remained jailed in lieu of $200,000 cash bond, with  
no date set for him to plead to the charges. Public defender Dennis 
Egre, Langenbach's attorney, declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Parents of Columbine Gunmen Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The family of one of the students slain in the  
Columbine High massacre sued the parents of the teen-age gunmen for 
$250 million Thursday, accusing them of negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Geoffrey Fieger filed the lawsuit in state court on  
behalf of the parents of Isaiah Shoels, 18, who witnesses said was 
gunned down because he was black and an athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	``Responsibility for violence sometimes extends beyond the  
person who pulls the trigger,'' Fieger said. ``It sometimes extends 
to those who contribute to individual acts of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit names Wayne and Katherine Harris, and Thomas and  
Susan Klebold, whose sons hurled bombs and blasted away with guns 
inside Columbine on April 20, killing 12 students and a teacher. 
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold then committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Klebolds' lawyer had no comment. An  
attorney for the Harrises did not immediately return a call. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have said Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, had planned  
the attack for more than a year. In the Harris home, investigators 
found bomb-making materials and a diary that described how the 
massacre would be carried out. And the sawed-off barrel of a 
shotgun was lying on a dresser in Harris' bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the attack, Sheriff John Stone wondered how the  
young men's activities could have gone unnoticed and said: ``I 
think parents should be accountable for their kids' actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges the parents failed to take corrective action  
when their sons stockpiled guns and bombs, and gave them 
``extraordinary privileges'' despite their run-ins with the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents ``had a duty to not act negligently and to not  
expose others to the unreasonable risk of harm by such 
negligence,'' the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	Although courts have ruled parents can be held liable for such  
things as property damage done by their children, this type of case 
is much more difficult to prove, legal analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're talking about is an intentional, deliberate,  
criminal act,'' said Harvard Professor Alan Dershowitz. ``It would 
probably be illegal to hold parents responsible for their 
children's actions unless you can show some specific fault on the 
part of the parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Andrew Cohen of Denver, a legal analyst for the news  
media, said Fieger would have to prove the parents should have 
known their teen-agers were arming for an attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may turn out that they knew their kids weren't angels.  
That's a very far stretch from proving the attack would take 
place,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado law puts a $250,000 limit on damage awards for  
negligence caused by a minor. Fieger said if he wins the case, he 
will file an appeal to exceed the limit.

<HEADLINE> Funk Wants To Impress Home Folks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOMAC, Md. (AP) -- Fred Funk never played well in the  
tournament closest to his home -- until last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the final group,'' Funk said. ``But coming down 18, I  
was the one waving the white flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funk, the former golf coach at the University of Maryland and  
always a local favorite, led the Kemper Open after three rounds 
before shooting a 77 on Sunday to finish tied for third. His 
previous best finish in 12 Kempers was a tie for 27th, and he had 
missed the cut five times. 
</P>
<P>
	So, feeling he'd blown his big chance, Funk went into a funk.  
</P>
<P>
	``I replayed for months what happened to me on Sunday,'' said  
Funk, who was born in nearby Takoma Park. ``I wanted this 
tournament too much. I put a lot of pressure on myself. Two days 
after that, I didn't sleep for three days. Since then, I have had 
trouble on weekends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funk has been playing better lately, tying for second last week  
at the Colonial. But, as he prepared to tee off today for the first 
round of the Kemper, he had to shake off a recurring neck injury 
that would have him withdrawing from other tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to push it,'' Funk said. ``If I can swing  
at all, I'm going to play. If it were a normal tournament, I'd have 
probably pulled out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The galleries will be rooting for Funk again, but they also will  
have a soft spot for defending champion Stuart Appleby. The Kemper 
was the last tournament Appleby's wife saw him win before the freak 
traffic accident that took her life in London six weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Appleby returned here to relive some  
memories. Now he's trying to focus on his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a little bit different from a normal week, but not  
much,'' he said. ``Every week is weird.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since his return to golf after the accident, Appleby has become  
everybody's sentimental favorite. He credited his wife's 
inspiration for victories at the Coolum Classic in Australia in 
December and the Houston Open earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my choice to be the sentimental favorite,'' Appleby  
said. ``It's nice to think there are people out there supporting 
me, maybe more than someone else, that's nice. That's their choice. 
I'd rather be someone who they like and they're all happy to see 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since it began playing host to the Kemper 12 years ago, the  
Avenel course has developed from a much-maligned place to avoid to 
a challenging stop that's earned some respect. All the winners of 
last year's majors -- Vijay Singh, Lee Janzen and Mark O'Meara -- are 
in the field, as well as seven of the top 15 on the current PGA 
Tour money list. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Funk, another golfer with local ties arriving with a hot  
game is Olin Browne, a Washington native who won the Colonial for 
his second career title. He's getting his restless nights in before 
the tournament starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I haven't had a decent night's  
sleep yet,'' said Browne, who is staying with his mother and is 
having his brother caddy for him. ``I'm just going to try to let 
things flow.''

<HEADLINE> Last Train Accident Victim Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- The 10-year-old Ecuadorean boy who was  
struck and gravely injured by a train that killed his mother and 
three brothers died today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Francisco Urgiles Toledo was declared brain-dead at  
Bridgeport Hospital two days after the accident. His family agreed 
to donate his organs. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, his brothers and their mother were struck by an Amtrak  
train from behind as they walked across a trestle in the middle of 
the night. He lost most of his left leg and suffered severe head 
injuries and broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Julia Toledo, 47, and brothers, ages 3, 6 and 11,  
were killed instantly. Jose was so badly hurt that relatives 
originally misidentified him as the 6-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are still not certain why the family was walking  
the tracks at that hour, but believe she was trying to get 
somewhere, not commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and family members said Ms. Toledo, who came to the  
United States about a year and a half ago, was struggling to hold 
together her family, hold down a job and keep a home. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends have also noted that it is a common practice in Latin  
American countries to walk along railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Toledo's husband had returned to their native Ecuador, and  
she had filed for divorce in 1998, a case that was later dropped 
because Ms. Toledo had not been a resident of Bridgeport long 
enough to file suit. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, day care had been difficult to find, and Ms. Toledo  
had recently quit her job to care for the children. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo had moved out of a Bridgeport apartment and into a  
shelter, and police Officer Jose Reyes -- who knew the family -- told 
The Hartford Courant that Ms. Toledo feared her sister was trying 
to have her committed to a mental hospital and take guardianship of 
the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ecuador, Ms. Toledo's estranged husband, Carlos Urgiles, a  
farm laborer in the Andean town of Cojitambo, said in a TV 
interview earlier Thursday that he was stunned to hear of the 
deaths of his wife and three of his sons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a great pain in my chest. It hurts to have lost my  
senora and children,'' Urgiles said, sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
	Urgiles, 52, said he never got to say goodbye to his children  
when he returned from the United States more than a year ago 
because his wife's sister and her family would not let him see 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The families frequently clashed because Urgiles' family is  
Catholic and his sister-in-law's is Mormon, he said. He said he 
decided to return to Ecuador because of the fights over religion. 
</P>
<P>
	Urgiles' friends and family members in Cojitambo are trying to  
collect money to send him to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ecuador, a South American nation of 12 million, people  
attributed the family's death to their nation's poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The death of this woman and her children is due to the  
desperation we Ecuadoreans feel to leave the country because of 
economic problems. There is no work here,'' Quito shopkeeper 
Bernardo Delgado said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Unhappy Being Sixth Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell looked back Thursday on  
his first season with the Knicks, pronouncing himself happy in 
general but still unconvinced he's best suited to be the team's 
sixth man. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've accepted it, more or less,'' Sprewell said after the  
Knicks held a three-hour practice to prepare for the Indiana Pacers 
in the Eastern Conference finals. ``I'm accepting it because I know 
that's the way it's going to be and I can't change it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's displeasure at being brought off the bench has been  
an issue with the Knicks since the midpoint of the season, when he 
returned from a foot injury that cost him his early-season spot in 
the starting five. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy has persistently maintained that the team  
has a better chance to win with Sprewell coming off the bench, and 
that line of thinking -- Van Gundy's critics call it a stubborn 
streak -- doesn't figure to change in the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	But as for next season, Sprewell's agent is on record as saying  
he'll demand a trade if his client isn't a starter. And with 
Sprewell about to enter the final year of his contract, there are 
plenty of people around New York who feel the team might be better 
off trading him for a top-notch point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried about next year, I'm thinking about this year  
and especially the game on Sunday,'' Sprewell said. ``I think I've 
handled it pretty well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has been the Knicks' leading scorer in the postseason,  
averaging 19.0 points in 32.7 minutes after averaging 16.4 points 
and 33.3 minutes in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	When he played for Golden State, Sprewell usually averaged  
around 40 minutes per game and -- as he'll tell you -- consistently 
ranked among the top five in that category leaguewide. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument has been made that Van Gundy is keeping three of  
his best five players under wraps because Sprewell has been more 
consistent than starter Alan Houston, Chris Childs has played 
better than starting point guard Charlie Ward, and Marcus Camby has 
outplayed starting power forward Kurt Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy's insistence on adhering so strictly with his favored  
rotation is sure to be one of the questions he'll be asked by 
acting team president Dave Checketts when the two sit down at the 
end of the season to discuss whether the coach will return. It's 
yet another angle among the different power struggles that have 
taken place with the Knicks this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far in the postseason, Van Gundy has only been willing to  
insert Sprewell into the game a minute or two earlier if the team 
gets off to a poor start. In their nine playoff games, the Knicks 
have been trailing or tied four times when Sprewell has checked in 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows he wants to start, but I think he's accepted  
that role as the go-to guy off the bench,'' said Camby, one of 
Sprewell's closest friends on a cliquish team whose newer additions 
don't hang out with the holdovers from last season. ``As soon as he 
gets off the bench, the Garden goes crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camby is one of Sprewell's few allies on the Knicks, but the two  
did not know each other until both got to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the public at large, Camby had a preconceived notion of  
what the real Sprewell was like. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he would be this rowdy guy who goes out every night  
and talks a lot, but he's really quiet and keeps to himself,'' 
Camby said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the locker room and at practice, however, Sprewell is more  
talkative than any of his teammates. It is not uncommon for him to 
answer patiently questions for 20 minutes or more, part of his 
effort to rehabilitate his image following the choking attack on 
Golden State coach P.J. Carlesimo that he became so infamous for. 
</P>
<P>
	But for every step forward that Sprewell takes, there are those  
who feel he takes a step backward and acts selfish by expressing 
his displeasure with coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to start in this league, and Latrell,  
rightfully so, wants to start, too,'' Childs said. ``But he's 
figured out that's he still going to get the amount of minutes that 
he would get as a starter and he's going to be in the game down the 
stretch. You always want to start, but that's something that he has 
to talk about after the season.''

<HEADLINE> Cardigans Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 3,800 Tommy Hilfiger infant cardigans  
are being recalled after a plastic snap on a cardigan snapped, 
presenting a choking hazard to the infant. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilfiger received one report of a snap detaching from the front  
of the fleece cardigan, but the baby wasn't injured, the U.S. 
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Help-Wanted Ads Declined in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Help-wanted advertising in the nation's major  
newspapers declined slightly in April, but demand for jobs still 
remains strong, according to a study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private business research group, said  
its monthly advertising index dipped to 87 last month from 88 in 
March. The index, based on 100, was 90 in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seven-year trend of strong hiring is not about to fold  
up,'' said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein predicted that consumer spending and growth in wages  
will help create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The regions with the largest declines in help-wanted ads in the  
last three months were the East North Central, which includes Ohio, 
Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan, and New England, which 
includes Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Increases in help-wanted ads occurred in the Middle Atlantic  
region, including New York and Pennsylvania, and East South 
Central, including Tennessee, Alabama and Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted advertising index, which stood at 100 in  
the base year of 1987, is derived from measuring the volume of 
employment ads in 51 major newspapers across the country each 
month. It is used as a nongovernmental gauge of changes in local, 
regional and national job supply.

<HEADLINE> Movies May Be a Mouse Click Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Imagine a Blockbuster night without  
Blockbuster, a time when no video store will ever slap you with a 
late fee or fine you for failing to rewind. Because, in this world 
there are no videos, only home computers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's closer than you might imagine -- and closer than the video  
industry may want to admit. 
</P>
<P>
	With technology surging ahead and investors going gaga over any  
company with a ``dot.com'' to its name, interest is building in 
delivering rental movies over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	It's already technically possible for those with fast Internet  
connections. One company recently offered over the Internet the 
brainy sci-fi film ``Pi'' for $2.95 a pop, and its upcoming slate 
includes the Rosanna Arquette picture ``Fait Accompli'' and the 
B-movie anti-classic ``Toxic Avenger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet movies for the masses must still wait for a variety of  
technical, economic and regulatory problems to be sorted out. The 
best estimates see Internet movies booming in five to 10 years 
</P>
<P>
	But the prospect of having movies a mouse click away has already  
shaken up an entertainment industry that was late in recognizing 
the impact of music over the Internet. It has also moved society 
another step closer to a lifestyle bound up in the Internet and the 
home computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of change are everywhere, from the financial markets to  
studio boardrooms, even the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-profile lawsuit by Jeffrey Katzenberg against his  
former company, the Walt Disney Co., is now focusing on Hollywood's 
high-tech future, with his first expert witness last Tuesday 
predicting tens of millions of homes will have movies-on-demand in 
the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	This is important to Katzenberg because he believes his fat  
incentive bonus -- the subject of the litigation -- will grow even 
fatter by a cut from the money Disney can make off 
Internet-delivered movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, in Cannes, moviemakers were joined at this year's  
film festival by Web company executives on the prowl for product. 
One of them, Michael Metcalfe, recalled that when he went to the 
Cannes Film Festival last year ``no one would really listen to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, I came back and it was just overwhelming,'' said  
Metcalfe, head of Canadian-based Global Media Corp., which wants to 
deliver movies over the Internet. ``The response was just, 'Wow! 
When can we do this?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Cannes was Scott Sander, president of Sightsound.com,  
who went to the festival after signing what is believed to be the 
first licensing deal between a studio and an Internet company, 
acquiring the cyberspace rights to ``Pi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people in the industry were really blown away by  
this,'' said Sander, noting that research found a surprising 
percentage of those downloading ``Pi'' were entertainment business 
types checking out the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Sander believes demand for Internet movies initially will be  
fueled by college students, whose schools have broadband Internet 
connections that can download a feature-length movie in about 20 
minutes and show it on a Microsoft media player. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Internet company going into movies is Broadcast.com,  
which has bought a stake in Trimark Entertainment for about $4 
million in stock. That gave Broadcast.com the distribution rights 
to ``Warlock'' and dozens of other titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step will be high-speed hookups in the average American  
home. The exact timeline is still in dispute, but the process may 
have been sped up by recent technological breakthroughs in software 
compression, the now-routine digitizing of movies for the new DVD 
format, and megadeals like the one struck by AT&AMP;T to get into the 
cable business. 
</P>
<P>
	Predictably, those least bullish on Internet movies are video  
store owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the short time frame, I think it's only real value is  
publicity and gimmickry,'' said Mark Vrieling, owner of three Rain 
City Video stores in Seattle and chairman of the board of the Video 
Software Dealers Association. ``The pipes just aren't there to 
handle it. It's not even close. Until that infrastructure is built, 
it's just not realistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Vrieling has no illusions about Internet movies; he just  
thinks it will take longer than others expect. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the year 2010 and beyond, that may be a realistic way that  
movies are distributed, and it's got a potential for affecting us 
in a very large way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing going for the video industry is that it has confounded  
all previous predictions of its demise. It has survived everything 
from pay-per-view movies to the recent upheaval over rental 
revenue-sharing deals with the studios. 
</P>
<P>
	And it may survive Internet movies. One option is for video  
stores to join the Web wave. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing stops us from having a bunch of DVDs in the back room  
and sending them to people's houses on phone line,'' Vrieling said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Internet movies are not expected to affect theatrical  
movies -- in the same way video has not crimped the old-fashioned 
way of watching films -- the major studios are wary. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Katzenberg trial, for example, Disney is a lot less  
optimistic about its cyberfuture, and not just because it's trying 
to save shareholders a few hundred million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The studios fear Internet-delivered movies will only exacerbate  
the huge problem of movie piracy, which is already costing 
Hollywood millions in video sales at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	During the early media previews of the new ``Star Wars''  
prequel, audiences were urged to report anyone who may have been 
clandestinely videotaping the film. But despite 20th Century Fox's 
vigilance, pirated copies of ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom 
Menace'' are sure to surface following the theft earlier this week 
of a print from a theater in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Films like ``Armageddon,'' ``Godzilla,'' ``Payback'' and ``The  
Thin Red Line'' have all been found on Internet sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see the Internet as a great opportunity and a great  
resource for the film industry,'' said Richard Taylor, spokesman 
for the Motion Picture Association of America, the lobbying arm of 
the major movie studios. ``But we also recognize that if left 
unchecked, piracy on the Internet can cause a great deal of 
damage.''

<HEADLINE> D-Backs Call Up Pitching Sensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Minor league sensation Byung-Hyun Kim's  
apprenticeship in Triple-A ended for the time being Thursday, when 
the Arizona Diamondbacks recalled him from Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old Korean right-hander, who gets four different  
breaks on his slider out of a submarine-style delivery, will join 
the Diamondbacks in New York on Friday for the first game of a 
series against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been pitching with a maturity far beyond his years,''  
team general manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Bobby Chouinard was optioned to Tucson to make  
room. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries gave the Diamondbacks a reason to accelerate Kim's  
progress to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	The team put Todd Stottlemyre on the disabled list last week  
when he tore his rotator cuff, and replaced him in the rotation 
with Brian Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullpen was short because of Darren Holmes' back problems.  
Holmes, who had a shot Tuesday to kill the pain caused by a bulging 
disk, is on the roster but won't be available for action until at 
least this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, who began the season with Double-A El Paso, has been a  
starter in Tucson but was expected to work out of the Diamondbacks' 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim attracted attention last June, when he struck out 15 U.S.  
Olympic Team batters in 6 2-3 innings. He pitched three hitless 
innings of relief against the U.S. team later last summer, and Clay 
Daniel, the Diamondbacks' international scouting director, signed 
him as a free agent this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Kim is undefeated as a pro.  
</P>
<P>
	He was 2-0 with a 2.11 ERA in 10 relief appearances at Double-A  
El Paso. Promoted to Tucson two weeks ago, he was 2-0 with a 2.60 
ERA in three starts, striking out 21 and allowing 13 hits in 17 1-3 
innings.

<HEADLINE> Dull Named Northridge AD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dick Dull, who resigned as University of  
Maryland athletic director after the cocaine death of basketball 
star Len Bias, is the new athletic director at Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Dull, 53, the AD at Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pa., for the  
past year, was hired Wednesday. He said he's grown since his 
Maryland days and developed a deep respect for academic achievement 
by athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dull, who is also an attorney, said his two immediate priorities  
at Northridge will be to solidify support for the intercollegiate 
athletic program and expand its fund raising ability. He will draw 
a starting salary of $110,004. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northridge athletic program consists of 20 teams -- 10 men's  
and 10 women's -- mostly in the Big Sky Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Dull succeeds Sam Jankovich, former University of Miami athletic  
director and New England Patriots chief operating officer, who was 
hired as interim AD nearly six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Departing CSUN President Blenda Wilson said Dull's understanding  
of the mistakes he made as the athletic director at Maryland in the 
mid-1980s worked in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``That experience enabled him to grow in his appreciation of the  
academic foundations that an intercollegiate athletic Division I 
program has to have,'' Wilson said. ``He's a very strong advocate 
for the academic achievement of students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cal State Northridge sports program has had a troubled past.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, baseball, soccer, swimming and volleyball were  
eliminated at Northridge because of an $800,000 athletics budget 
deficit and state-mandated gender-equality requirements. The sports 
were reinstated two months later. 
</P>
<P>
	Jankovich was an interim replacement for Paul Bubb, who resigned  
effective Nov. 6, 1998 -- shortly after Northridge women's 
basketball coach Michael Abraham was charged with selling cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Bubb was forced out after he revealed to Wilson he was  
approached earlier by CSUN women's basketball players who suspected 
Abraham was using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fund raising is a major issue at CSUN. Wilson recently committed  
to a new football stadium on campus and the athletic department is 
facing an $800,000 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dull isn't making fund raising his top priority. He said he  
first wants to ``see if there are any wounds we need to heal'' in 
the aftermath of the on-campus arrest of Abraham.

<HEADLINE> Hartman's Estate Sues Zoloft Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The executor of Phil Hartman's estate is  
suing the makers of the antidepressant Zoloft and Brynn Hartman's 
psychiatrist, claiming Mrs. Hartman suffered side effects from the 
drug that caused her to shoot the comedian and then kill herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory Omdahl, Mrs. Hartman's brother and the executor of the  
couple's estate, contends his sister's psychiatrist prescribed 
Zoloft to her without properly diagnosing her condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zoloft is an antidepressant that in some people causes violent  
and suicidal side effects,'' said Karen Barth, attorney for Omdahl. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests conducted after Mrs. Hartman's death showed she had  
Zoloft, alcohol and cocaine in her system at the time of the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The wrongful death lawsuit, filed Wednesday, names as defendants  
New York-based Pfizer Inc. and Los Angeles psychiatrist Arthur 
Sorosky. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartman, 49, star of the television sitcom ``NewsRadio,'' was  
shot to death May 28, 1998, by his wife in the couple's Encino 
home. Mrs. Hartman, 40, then killed herself. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesperson for Pfizer could not be reached after business  
hours Thursday. Sorosky declined comment.

<HEADLINE> GDP Growing at 4.1 Percent Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The biggest consumer spending spree in 11  
years kept the economy growing at a robust rate in the year's first 
quarter, the government said today. But financial markets took a 
nosedive on investor worries that the fast growth would trigger 
higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy grew at a solid annual rate of 4.1 percent, even  
though the country's trade deficit was a bigger drag on growth than 
previously thought, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's new figure for gross domestic product -- the  
broadest measure of economic health -- represented a slight downward 
revision from a 4.5 percent figure released a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new figure still showed a remarkably strong economy, now  
in its longest peacetime expansion. The GDP report also showed that 
corporate profits, which had been in the doldrums, had a sizable 
rebound for the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy is healthy, inflation is largely absent and  
earnings are picking up. Not a bad combination,'' Merrill Lynch 
economist Bruce Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending, which powered the 4.1 percent increase, grew  
at an annual rate of 6.8 percent -- the fastest increase since early 
1988. That was even better than the original estimate of a 6.7 
percent increase in consumer spending, which accounts for 
two-thirds of total economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	An inflation gauge tied to the GDP rose 1.1 percent in the first  
quarter, showing price pressures remained well contained. 
</P>
<P>
	But financial markets, which have grown increasingly nervous  
about inflation, were not impressed with the figure. The Dow Jones 
industrial average closed down 235.23 points to close at 10,466.93 
-- the biggest point drop since last September -- though the 2.2 
percent decline was not among the largest historically in 
percentage terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were focused on the fact that economic growth remains  
well above the comfort level of the Federal Reserve, which only a 
week ago indicated it is edging closer to raising interest rates 
because of worries the economy is growing too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is that the Fed probably would view this as  
still excessive growth,'' said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. 
Lanston &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts believe that the central bank could start raising  
interest rates as soon as its next meeting June 29-30 if inflation 
pressures appear to be mounting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the January-March quarter, economic growth was reduced by  
2.53 percentage points by record trade deficits tied to the global 
financial crisis that has pushed one-third of the world into 
recession. That, in turn, has cut sharply into American export 
sales and generated a flood of cheaper imports in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the wider trade deficit in the revised figures,  
the government said the GDP dropped from its estimate of a month 
ago because businesses were not building up inventories as fast as 
originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said the lower inventories will bolster growth above  
what had been expected in the current quarter because businesses 
will not have to cut back production to work off unwanted 
stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted the GDP would expand at an annual rate of 3.5  
percent in the April-June period, down only slightly from the first 
quarter rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.1 percent growth rate in the first quarter was even faster  
than the 3.9 GDP increase for all of 1998. The GDP expanded 6 
percent in the final three months of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (GDP first quarter) revision was small and still signals a  
very booming U.S. economy and a lopsided pattern of spending -- a 
consumer boom and a trade bust,'' said Allen Sinai, economist with 
Primark Decision Economics. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate profits for the first quarter increased at an annual  
rate of $31.8 billion -- the biggest annualized increase in two 
years. Corporate profits had fallen $5.3 billion in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebound was attributed to lower payments tobacco companies  
had to make on out-of-court settlements. Those settlements had 
subtracted $13.5 billion from fourth quarter profits and only $900 
million in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Labor Department said the number of  
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits was unchanged 
last week at 300,000. New claims have been at or below the 
300,000-person market for 12 of the last 21 weeks, a sign of the 
best job market conditions in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to consumer spending, first-quarter growth was  
bolstered by a 10 percent increase in business investment and a 
15.4 percent rise in housing construction, enjoying a boom because 
of low mortgage rates and record high levels of consumer 
confidence.

<HEADLINE> Letters Detail Sexual Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- He called her ``Banana Queen'' and ``Love  
Flower,'' and had a photo in his cell of her dressed in only a 
black bra and panties. 
</P>
<P>
	The object of inmate Byron Smoot's apparent affection wasn't his  
wife -- she was someone else's. Even worse, authorities say, she was 
a former prison psychologist who had an affair with Smoot and 
helped him and a convicted murderer escape from Maryland 
Correctional Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Feil, 43, was charged with helping the men in their  
short-lived escape after authorities found more than 100 letters 
from Smoot to Ms. Feil in her Annapolis home. And that photo, taken 
11 years ago when Glenn Bosshard and Ms. Feil were on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosshard identified his wife as the woman in the photo when  
sheriff's deputies showed up at his door. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until that point, I thought we were deeply in love. You  
have no idea how devastated I am by this,'' Bosshard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoot, a 29-year-old armed robber, and Gregory Lawrence, a  
39-year-old convicted murderer, escaped from the medium-security 
prison in Jessup on May 18. They were captured two days later in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Feil was charged Tuesday and released on $5,225 bail. If  
convicted, she could be sentenced to more than 12 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	She has denied the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	Letters found stashed in shoe boxes at Ms. Feil's home detail a  
sexual relationship between the pair, Bosshard's lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are love letters, some are very pornographic,'' said the  
attorney, David Fischer. ``They detail and confirm that Mr. Smoot 
and Dr. Feil had a sexual and emotional relationship for more than 
a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the letters, Smoot calls Ms. Feil ``Love Flower,'' ``Banana  
Queen,'' and ``Bookie,'' and signs them, ``Love Byron, your loving 
husband.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoot, who is married to a Methodist minister in Baltimore,  
tells Ms. Feil he looks forward to the day when they will elope and 
get married, and have the chance to be together. 
</P>
<P>
	One letter contains a detailed description of his escape plans,  
including a map showing his route and where she should pick him up, 
Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Smoot instructs Ms. Feil to ``dress like a  
professional old lady, with glasses,'' so the guards won't notice 
her. ``It will take 20 minutes for them to respond. We'll be long 
gone,'' the letter says. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoot and Lawrence escaped by walking past an unmanned guard  
tower next to the front gate of the prison and scaling a razor-wire 
fence. When they went to a nearby phone booth, they dialed Ms. 
Feil's pager, state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	They suspect Ms. Feil picked them up in her car and drove them  
to an inexpensive hotel in Baltimore, where she tried to bandage 
their wounds from the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer said prison logs show Ms. Feil visiting Smoot more than  
60 times in nine months. Police also have a copy of a $595 phone 
bill that he says proves Smoot used five fax lines from the prison 
to call his lover. Some of the calls lasted nearly an hour, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Feil's attorney, Isaiah Dixon III, did not return telephone  
calls by The Associated Press on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Feil, who was a contractual employee, met Smoot in July 1997  
when she worked at the Patuxent Institution, a maximum-security 
prison that specializes in rehabilitating inmates. She was fired 
from her job on June 28, 1998 after it was discovered she had set 
up a post office box to receive letters from another inmate, prison 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	State police also have letters and documents showing Ms. Feil  
and Smoot tried to set up a business to finance their new life 
after Smoot's escape, according to Fischer. Fliers advertising the 
business, ``St. Byron &AMP; Elizabeth Specialty Consulting'' were found 
at her home, he said.

<HEADLINE> Parents of Columbine Gunmen Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The family of one of the students slain in the  
Columbine High massacre sued the parents of the teen-age gunmen for 
$250 million Thursday, accusing them of negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Geoffrey Fieger filed the lawsuit in state court on  
behalf of the parents of Isaiah Shoels, 18, who witnesses said was 
gunned down because he was black and an athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	``Responsibility for violence sometimes extends beyond the  
person who pulls the trigger,'' Fieger said. ``It sometimes extends 
to those who contribute to individual acts of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit names Wayne and Katherine Harris, and Thomas and  
Susan Klebold, whose sons hurled bombs and blasted away with guns 
inside Columbine on April 20, killing 12 students and a teacher. 
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold then committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Klebolds' lawyer had no comment. An  
attorney for the Harrises did not immediately return a call. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have said Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, had planned  
the attack for more than a year. In the Harris home, investigators 
found bomb-making materials and a diary that described how the 
massacre would be carried out. And the sawed-off barrel of a 
shotgun was lying on a dresser in Harris' bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the attack, Sheriff John Stone wondered how the  
young men's activities could have gone unnoticed and said: ``I 
think parents should be accountable for their kids' actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges the parents failed to take corrective action  
when their sons stockpiled guns and bombs, and gave them 
``extraordinary privileges'' despite their run-ins with the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents ``had a duty to not act negligently and to not  
expose others to the unreasonable risk of harm by such 
negligence,'' the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	Although courts have ruled parents can be held liable for such  
things as property damage done by their children, this type of case 
is much more difficult to prove, legal analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're talking about is an intentional, deliberate,  
criminal act,'' said Harvard Professor Alan Dershowitz. ``It would 
probably be illegal to hold parents responsible for their 
children's actions unless you can show some specific fault on the 
part of the parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Andrew Cohen of Denver, a legal analyst for the news  
media, said Fieger would have to prove the parents should have 
known their teen-agers were arming for an attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may turn out that they knew their kids weren't angels.  
That's a very far stretch from proving the attack would take 
place,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado law puts a $250,000 limit on damage awards for  
negligence caused by a minor. Fieger said if he wins the case, he 
will file an appeal to exceed the limit.

<HEADLINE> Gore: GOP, NRA Fighting Gun Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore called today for quick  
House action on gun control and accused Republicans of plotting to 
please the gun lobby by delaying a vote on Senate-passed 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay, Gore told reporters at the Capitol, ``is because some  
within the Republican caucus are so responsive to the'' National 
Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this very moment there are some of the other side meeting  
behind closed doors plotting to have more delays in order to 
preserve loopholes'' in firearms law, he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have refused Democratic demands to pass the Senate's  
gun provisions this week, outlining instead a schedule for cautious 
consideration of the provisions and a vote in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a Second Amendment, there is a fundamental right that  
we're dealing with and therefore we should move expeditiously but 
not in a stampede,'' Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who chairs the House 
Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday. ``We're going to do this and 
we're going to do it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's comments came a week after he broke a tie vote as the  
Senate passed a Democratic measure to require background checks of 
all firearms transactions at gun shows and pawn shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential candidate said the Senate bill didn't go far  
enough in gun restrictions and that the House should pass a tougher 
bill. He did not specify what additional provisions he would 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders have said they support the concept of the gun  
restrictions in the Senate bill but called a hearing today to 
investigate the specifics. Speaker Dennis Hastert and other GOP 
leaders have refused Democratic demands that they approve at least 
some of the Senate gun restrictions before mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing with Gore, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.,  
and about a dozen other congressional Democrats was a Virginia 
woman planning to testify later today before the House Judiciary 
crime subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrl Phillips-Taylor of Richmond, Va., said she was turning her  
grief over her son's murder to gun control activism. Clutching a 
photograph of her son, Scott, Phillips-Taylor told reporters that 
he had been killed eight years ago by a ``classmate with a grudge'' 
and an AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, 17, was lured by the classmate from his place of work and  
shot six times. 
</P>
<P>
	Also set to testify before the House subcommittee were NRA  
officials, the father of one of the murdered Columbine High School 
students and a Denver trauma surgeon who worked on some of the 
victims of those shootings.

<HEADLINE> Longer Trading Approved for Nasdaq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Come autumn, investors could be buying and  
selling shares of Microsoft Corp. and 99 other companies on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market while watching Ally McBeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers, which governs  
Nasdaq, on Thursday approved a plan to extend trading hours from 
the current 9:30 a.m.-4 p.m. Eastern time schedule. A second 
session of the day would likely start at 5:30 p.m. and end at 9 
p.m. or 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are expected to take effect around September, after  
a review by the Securities and Exchange Commission and discussions 
with industry leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``This business of extended hours is a serious market-quality  
question, and it needs to be addressed with a great deal of 
seriousness,'' said Frank Zarb, chairman and chief executive of the 
National Association of Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has been urging restraint, proposing a delay until next  
year so that the securities industry would not be extending trading 
hours at the same time it is confronting the Year 2000 computer bug 
and preparing to shift from reporting stock prices in fractions to 
the use of decimals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zarb said Nasdaq is still sticking with its plans for  
starting night trading around September. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear the marketplace needs this kind of innovation, and  
we are going to provide the leadership to get us from here to 
there,'' Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	The groundbreaking decision, which could throw many Wall Street  
companies into chaos, is being made to accommodate the growing 
number of investors who trade at home over the Internet. But the 
securities industry, especially smaller firms, will have to find 
ways for brokers and backroom recordkeepers to accommodate the 
nighttime business. 
</P>
<P>
	In a poll for the CNBC financial cable news channel, 53 percent  
of active investors 21 years of age or older liked the idea of 
trading well into the evening, while 31 percent opposed the move. 
The poll of more than 500 people and had a margin of error of plus 
or minus 4.4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, trading would be limited to Nasdaq's 100 largest,  
nonfinancial companies, led by Microsoft and including such other 
well-known stocks as Intel Corp., Northwest Airlines Corp. and MCI 
WorldCom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks would still have a final, closing price reported at the 4  
p.m. end of the daytime session. Any after-hour trades would count 
toward the following day's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities subject to stock splits, or stock dividends would be  
suspended from trading in the evening session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are calling on the industry to do the right thing, to  
coordinate and be responsible and move in unison so the investor 
can be properly protected in the new world of extended hours,'' 
Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement after the vote, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said  
the SEC supports ``investor choice in trading hours. Before 
widespread trading begins outside of regular hours, however, a 
number of investor protection and market integrity issues need to 
be addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those issues include broad distribution of stock price data and  
the capacity of computer systems to handle the trading load. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange  
said the Big Board also is considering a plan to extend its trading 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the traditional markets are facing increased competition  
from overseas exchanges, which often trade shares of U.S.-based 
companies, and from alternative computer-based exchanges in the 
United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Zarb acknowledged that he has been approached by New  
York city and state officials about moving into part of the new 
facility that is being built for the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have looked at it and we have asked them for more  
information,'' he said, but added, ``Based upon what we know now, 
it's not our favorite option by a longshot.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-GOP Leader Admits Funneling Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A former county GOP chairman pleaded guilty  
Thursday to violating campaign finance law by illegally funneling 
$11,000 to Democratic U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli. 
</P>
<P>
	Berek Paul Don, 51, pleaded guilty to election law violation,  
mail fraud and tax evasion. He could get up to five years in prison 
and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines when sentenced Aug. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
	Don, a lawyer, was Bergen County GOP chairman during the 1996  
election. He said he cashed an $11,000 check from political donor 
David Chang, who had asked him to get the money into Torricelli's 
campaign fund, and solicited others to make donations with the 
understanding that they would be reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli's chief of staff, Jamie Fox, said the campaign was  
``totally unaware'' that Don or anyone else was not following 
election law rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way you can know,'' Torricelli said. ``People have  
to learn to take these laws seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don is the 18th person charged by the government's Campaign  
Financing Task Force, and the third plea deal announced in the past 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The others involved two longtime friends of President Clinton,  
former Lippo Group executive John Huang and Yah Lin ``Charlie'' 
Trie, a restaurateur from Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Don said he was helped by his onetime law partner, Carmine R.  
Alampi. Prosecutors would not discuss Alampi, who did not return a 
phone call.

<HEADLINE> Alonzo Newby To Take the Fifth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A central figure in the allegations of  
academic fraud in the University of Minnesota men's basketball 
program will not cooperate with investigators, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alonzo Newby, who is on disability leave from his job as the  
team's academic counselor, will invoke his right to remain silent, 
his attorney, Ron Rosenbaum, said Wednesday in a letter to the 
university's outside investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators want to ask Newby about allegations he made a cash  
payment to former office manager Jan Gangelhoff to tutor players at 
a time when she wasn't supposed to be associated with the program, 
and that he arranged for players' grades to be changed to keep them 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	University administrators said they were disappointed because  
they know of nothing Newby did that would warrant any criminal 
prosecution or liability. They said his refusal to testify may 
hamper the investigation, but suggested that his attorney may have 
left the door open for future questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would genuinely like to get Mr. Newby's side of the  
story,'' said Tonya Moten Brown, chief of staff to President Mark 
Yudof. ``I think it's important for the integrity of the program 
that the truth be known. And I think we do not want negative 
inferences to be drawn by his failure to cooperate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although investigators are still negotiating with other  
witnesses, Newby is the first who has declined to participate, 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof has ordered all university employees to cooperate with  
investigators. Brown said firing Newby is an option if he does not 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said 120 people other than Newby may contribute useful  
information to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenbaum said he is concerned that Newby is being set up to  
take the fall for others at the university and that the 
investigation would only serve as a means to prosecute his client. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be in a much better position if the major newspapers  
and the university said they are done investigating and these are 
all the facts,'' Rosenbaum told the Saint Paul Pioneer Press. ``But 
I don't think that is going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a related matter, Yudof met for an hour Wednesday with some  
of the students who demonstrated on campus Monday against what they 
consider special treatment for athletes accused of sexual 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the meeting, they sent Yudof an open letter with four  
demands. He accepted all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically agreed with all four points they had made in the  
letter -- that we needed a prompt investigation, and we needed to 
look into structural changes,'' Yudof said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also agreed to a public apology if it is proved  
that university officials thwarted efforts to report sexual 
offenses, and he agreed to establish a protocol for protecting 
alleged victims during the investigation.

<HEADLINE> North Korean Trade Falls Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea's external trade totaled  
$1.66 billion last year, a third less than the year before, South 
Korea said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Korea Trade Association said North Korean exports  
dropped to $650 million last year, down 40.6 percent from 1997, 
while its imports fell 27 percent to $1.01 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The calculations were based on customs clearance statistics  
compiled from 70 countries and regions, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the figures reflected North Korea's worsening economic  
difficulties amid severe shortages of food, energy and foreign 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Reclusive North Korea's trade with the outside world, largely  
former communist countries, reached $4.72 billion in 1990 but has 
gradually fallen since. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea's major export items include textiles, machinery and  
marine products. About 40 percent of its imports are grains and 
cooking oil. 
</P>
<P>
	China, Japan and South Korea were North Korea's three major  
trading partners in 1998, accounting for about 62 percent of total 
trade, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea has been largely dependent on foreign aid to feed  
its 23 million people since 1995, after decades of economic 
mismanagement and several years of bad weather devastated its 
farming system.

<HEADLINE> Another Playoff Failure for Malone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- In a career marked by numerous playoff  
failures, Karl Malone was miserable again Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has to rank up there as one of the toughest losses in my  
career,'' Malone said after shooting 3-for-16 and scoring just 8 
points -- his lowest output in 148 career postseason games -- as the 
Jazz were eliminated from the Western Conference semifinals 92-80 
by the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hornacek, Stockton, (Bryon) Russell -- they all came up big.  
Everybody did, except for me,'' Malone said. ``If I could have done 
anything, we could have won. 
</P>
<P>
	``You win with pride, and you lose the same way.''  
</P>
<P>
	The veteran nucleus of the Jazz -- Malone, John Stockton and Jeff  
Hornacek -- are 35, 37 and 36 years old, respectively. All will be 
free agents this summer, and there again will be a chorus of voices 
claiming the team has gone as far as it can with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the one who controls who'll be back, but I think we  
will be back,'' Malone said. ``I don't know why not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone and Stockton have won with pride for the last 14 seasons,  
reaching the playoffs every season. They were in the conference 
finals four times in five seasons, and may have won a title or two 
if Michael Jordan hadn't come back from the baseball diamond. 
</P>
<P>
	They also might have a ring or two if Malone had come through in  
the clutch in key games. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he missed two free throws late in Game 7 of the  
conference finals at Seattle that could have put the Jazz in the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he missed two free throws at the end of in Game 1 of  
the NBA Finals at Chicago, opening the door for Jordan's 
buzzer-beating jumper that won it. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, he had the ball stolen from him by Jordan, leading to  
his famous title-winning jumper seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz were noticeably a step slower in the postseason this  
time. They were outhustled and nearly beaten in the first round by 
Sacramento, and their normally machine-like offense sputtered 
against the young, deep Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been a little spoiled by the success of being to the  
Finals two years in a row,'' Hornacek said. ``But you can't just 
give up. I don't expect any retirements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton ducked out of the locker room after the game and did  
not speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of our guys aren't 19 years old anymore,'' Jazz coach  
Jerry Sloan said. ``Are we done? We've been answering these 
questions for the last six years. I think they will be around a 
little longer. They have a right to come back.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 207.23 in Stock Selloff / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks resumed a downward lurch today as  
continued concerns about interest rates and inflation put the 
brakes on Wednesday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 207.23 at 10,494.93, more than wiping out Wednesday's gain. As 
the selloff deepened this afternoon, the Dow at one point was down 
as much as 267 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 18.27 at 1,286.49. The Nasdaq composite 
index, which is dominated by technology stocks, was holding on to a 
gain of 0.66, taking it to 2,427.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the Nasdaq dipped repeatedly into negative territory,  
analysts attributed the stronger performance to bargain-hunting 
following a sharp selloff of Internet stocks early this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those stocks had been already been beaten up pretty badly, so  
today, they're resisting the decline of the rest of the market,'' 
said Robert Robbins, senior vice president and market strategist at 
Robinson-Humphrey Co. Inc. of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow rose 171.07 points Wednesday, a gain of 1.6 percent, to  
close at 10,702.16. The rally was fed by big gains from IBM and a 
slight resurgence of Internet companies that have slid in recent 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the selling today was attributed to investors cashing in  
on Wednesday's rally in advance of the Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, continued fears that inflation will prompt the  
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates drew investors away from 
stocks. Higher interest rates can crimp corporate profits as it 
becomes more expensive for companies to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	New government figures on the economy today kept the market off  
balance. The Commerce Department said the U.S. economy grew at a 
robust annual rate of 4.1 percent in the first quarter, yet an 
inflation gauge tied to the report rose a modest 1.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices tumbled, sending the yield up to 5.84 percent from  
5.80 percent late Wednesday and further pressuring stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the government also said corporate profits showed a big  
rebound in the first three months of this year, increasing at an 
annual rate of $31.8 billion after having fallen at a rate of $5.3 
billion in the fourth quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't enough to entice buyers.  
</P>
<P>
	``There hasn't been any catalyst to bring people into the  
marketplace,'' said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; 
Co. in Milwaukee. The upcoming three-day holiday may also 
discourage money managers from taking big new positions, Berman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM fell 4 1/16 to 114 1/16 today, following a 2-for-1 stock  
split that took effect after the close of trading Wednesday. Some 
analysts also blamed persistent worries that computer makers will 
see their profit margins shrink as they cut prices to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank and brokerage stocks, which typically suffer when interest  
rates rise, were mostly lower. J.P. Morgan was off 3 3/4 at 135 1/8, and 
Bank of America fell 2 3/4 to 63 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	And cyclical stocks, which have risen in recent weeks, fell as  
investors locked in their gains. 3M slipped 3 7/8 to 84 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 13-to-6 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 639.7 million 
shares at late afternoon, trailing Wednesday's brisk pace. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sallie Mae Buys Student Loan Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sallie Mae, the nation's largest financer of  
student loans, has made its first big strategic move since becoming 
private, agreeing to buy a New England student loan maker for $320 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition was announced Wednesday by Sallie Mae, once a  
government-sponsored company that went private two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Nellie Mae, with offices in Braintree, Mass., and Rumford, R.I.,  
is the seventh-largest holder of federal student loans with a 
portfolio valued at $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Nellie Mae will become a subsidiary of  
Reston, Va.-based Sallie Mae and will retain its New England 
operations and regional sales offices across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the deal, Sallie Mae will be making more than $1  
billion a year in loans for study at nearly 250 colleges and 
universities by next year, Albert Lord, Sallie Mae's chief 
executive officer and vice chairman, told reporters in a telephone 
conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	``It fits right into our strategy ... of expanding our presence  
on campus,'' said Paul Carey, executive vice president of Sallie 
Mae. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition must be approved by the Justice Department and  
Massachusetts' attorney general. Sallie Mae officials said they 
expect it to be completed by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased to combine resources with Sallie Mae to  
continue to build the premier full-service education finance 
company,'' Lawrence O'Toole, president and CEO of Nellie Mae, said 
in a statement. He said the combination would enhance Nellie Mae's 
ability ``to serve our campus-based clients, students and family 
borrowers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sallie Mae, officially named the Student Loan Marketing  
Association, was a federally chartered enterprise and the nation's 
largest buyer of government-guaranteed student loans from banks 
before it became a private company. 
</P>
<P>
	It still buys many student loans from banks but also competes  
with banks by making loans directly to students and schools. Sallie 
Mae currently holds and manages $47 billion in student loans for 
more than 5 million borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of its parent company, SLM Holding Corp., were up 6 1/4  
cents at $41.18 3/4 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> FTC Approves Kroger Acquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission has approved The  
Kroger Co.'s $8 billion acquisition of Fred Meyer Inc., creating 
the nation's largest retail grocery chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Kroger said today in announcing the government agency's decision  
that the FTC required it to sell eight stores in Arizona, Wyoming 
and Utah. But it will still have some 3,400 stores from coast to 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of both companies approved the merger in April.  
</P>
<P>
	Kroger, already the nation's largest grocery, generated $28.2  
billion in sales last year while Fred Meyer had $14.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Together they have more than 300,000 employees, 2,200  
supermarkets, 800 convenience stores and 381 jewelry stores. 
Combined sales of $43.1 billion would account for 10 percent of all 
U.S. grocery sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Meyer will keep its headquarters in Portland, Ore., retain  
its name and operate as a unit of Kroger. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the $8 billion it is paying Fred Meyer  
shareholders, Kroger is assuming about $4.8 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph A. Pichler, Kroger's chief executive and chairman, is to  
retain those titles with the combined company. Ronald W. Burkle, 
Fred Meyer's chairman, will become chairman of the executive 
committee of Kroger's board.

<HEADLINE> IRL Chief Douses CART Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indy Racing League is no closer to  
ending its feud with rival CART, despite talks aimed at bringing 
the two sides together, IRL's president said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In his most extensive comments on the 4-year-old split in  
American open-wheel racing, Tony George accused CART of fueling 
reports of a reconciliation to boost its stock price, soothe 
sponsors and divert attention from the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	While admitting once again that it would be difficult for both  
series to survive, George said he got no indication of common 
ground at a meeting last week with Andrew Craig, chief executive 
officer of Championship Auto Racing Teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we have different philosophies, we're never going  
to strike any kind of accord,'' George said. ``I can't say I'm 
encouraged by anything we talked about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George, also president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, began  
the IRL in late 1995 as a low-cost, ovals-only alternative to CART. 
The older organization responded by boycotting the Indy 500, taking 
away some of the luster from the world's most famous race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to compromise ourselves just to get them back  
here,'' said George, preparing for his fourth 500 without CART. 
``It's as simple as that. The IRL is doing very well with its 
growth at this stage. Obviously, we've shown we don't need them to 
have a successful event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CART, which holds the Motorola 300 at Madison, Ill., on  
Saturday, is making plans to expand its 20-race schedule to other 
overseas markets, mentioning Germany and Mexico as possible sites. 
But Craig stressed his teams also want to go back to Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we are attempting to do is to act in good faith for what  
we believe is in the best interest of the sport and the fans,'' 
Craig said after being told of George's comments. ``We have made no 
secret of the fact that all our teams would like to race in 
Indianapolis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides face major hurdles, such as totally different  
chassis and engine specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea where all the speculation is coming from,''  
Craig said. ``We strongly believe that it's best not to comment on 
any of these specific issues at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George said he met with Craig in March and they got together  
again last week in Indianapolis. George also has met with NASCAR 
chief Bill France Jr., portrayed as the potential broker of a deal 
between the two open-wheel series. 
</P>
<P>
	France's International Speedway Corp., which owns and operates  
NASCAR, recently bought Penske Motorsports. That gave ISC 10 
racetracks, with at least three more planned in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	George said his talks with Craig focused on their general  
support for open-wheel racing, but didn't focus on specifics for 
bringing the two sides together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, he wasn't trying to cast himself as someone who has  
all the answers,'' George said. ``It was more to express an 
interest in what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though nearly all of the most-established drivers remained with  
CART after the split, George clearly feels he has the upper hand 
because the IRL has the Indy 500. He said talk of a merger is 
merely an attempt to bolster CART, which is a publicly traded 
company on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to continue to give some glimmer of hope that  
something is in the offing to help keep their stock price where 
they want it to be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	George's right-hand man, IRL executive director Leo Mehl, also  
gave little hint of a compromise earlier Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call it the May whine,'' Mehl said. ``Those CART guys are  
very concerned with what's going on here. If they come back here 
with the same engines we use, the same chassis, they'll get their 
doors blown off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George and Mehl said there would be no attempt to reach a deal  
that would allow the CART teams to return to the Indy 500 unless 
they run the other 10 IRL races, too. 
</P>
<P>
	George conceded that neither open-wheel series is likely to  
reach the popularity of NASCAR's stock-car series unless they 
merge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later, it will have to come to just one series for  
it to flourish,'' George said. ``I don't know and I don't have a 
crystal ball to predict what that outcome might be.''

<HEADLINE> BMW Recalls New 3-Series Sedans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Luxury automaker BMW announced a recall  
Thursday of all cars from its newly redesigned 3-series of small 
sedans because of technical problems with side airbags and brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW said the side airbag could accidentally inflate in some  
circumstances, such as when the car brushes against a curb. In 
addition, some cars could experience brake failure if an improperly 
installed safety clip becomes loose, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of 3-series cars, introduced in April 1998, should bring  
the car to their dealer to have it checked, BMW said.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Wright To Meet With Budig </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Jaret Wright's reputation took another beaning  
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Oops, that slipped. Make that took another beating.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Indians have been involved in two bench-clearing  
incidents this season, and both times the infield wrestling matches 
came soon after Wright hit an opposing batter in the head with a 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month in Boston, Wright hit Red Sox outfielder Darren  
Lewis, the same player he plunked during the playoffs in October. 
Then last Saturday, Detroit first baseman Tony Clark got drilled in 
the batting helmet by one of Wright's fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright denied throwing at either hitter. Because of a past which  
includes breaking New York second baseman Luis Sojo's hand during 
spring training last year, however, Wright may be getting a 
reputation as a headhunter. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Wright was fined by AL president Gene Budig for his  
role in Saturday's brawl. Budig also said he would meet with Wright 
and manager Mike Hargrove next Tuesday in New York to discuss the 
pitcher's ``deportment on the mound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a concern that he might be getting that reputation,''  
Hargrove said. ``I don't agree with it, but word has gotten around 
the league that Jaret is not afraid to pitch inside -- and he does. 
You've got to pitch inside to pitch well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indians GM John Hart said he spoke with Budig following last  
weekend's incident, and was surprised to learn that Wright was 
fined. Hart said he didn't know what Budig planned to discuss with 
the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us wants to see Jaret told how to pitch,'' Hart said.  
</P>
<P>
	While the Indians and Tigers were finger-pointing as they paired  
off in the infield like a hockey fight, some of the Tigers made 
references to Wright's history of dusting batters. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, who during the fracas got wrestled down from behind by  
Detroit manager Larry Parrish, said his 0-2 fastball to Clark just 
got away from him. Wright's body language said the same as his 
shoulders slumped and he took a few steps toward the plate to see 
how Clark was. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed an out there,'' Wright said. ``I was upset with  
myself because I hit him in the head. That's not what I was trying 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark believed Wright. Others weren't so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	Hart thinks perception is blurring reality. If Wright is guilty  
of anything, Hart says it's being young, confident and blessed with 
a live, sometimes erratic arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Jaret, all you have to do is watch his games,'' Hart  
said. ``This guy is not blessed with the greatest of command. This 
is a guy that's still trying to find where the ball is going to 
begin with. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of this is overblown. You go back to Boston, and  
Jaret hit Lewis with a breaking ball. I mean, come on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright refuses to give up the inside part of the plate, a tactic  
that has been used by power pitchers throughout baseball history. 
Hart, who caught in the minor leagues for the Montreal Expos, 
remembers former Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale teaching young 
pitchers not to be afraid to move hitters off the plate -- or off 
their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Drysdale would tell them, two line drives and next guy goes  
down,'' Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart thinks Wright's tough-guy demeanor on the mound may add to  
the perception that he's throwing at hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jaret is a tough kid, now question about it,'' he said. ``He's  
got kind of a football mentality out there. He comes after you. He 
wants to win. He wants to compete. That mentality, that presence 
out there on the mound maybe incites a little bit more than what 
the reality of the situation is. 
</P>
<P>
	``But looking at all the things that go into it. This young man  
is not a head hunter. Period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright's situation is similar to that of Boston's Pedro  
Martinez, said Hart. Martinez came into the majors as a 
hot-tempered, hard-thrower with Montreal, and after a few too many 
brushbacks, it wasn't long before he got labeled a headhunter. 
</P>
<P>
	But time has improved Martinez's control and his image. Now he's  
regarded as one of baseball's best pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a reputation for throwing at people for the first two  
or three years, and then he took off,'' Hart said. ``I know Jaret 
is not out there throwing at guys' heads. It's hard to live down a 
reputation like that, but I think he eventually will.''

<HEADLINE> Speed Limits Return to Montana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- The Wild West has gotten a little tamer on  
Montana's highways. 
</P>
<P>
	At dawn today, a speed limit took effect on the state's roads,  
ending Montana's status as the last state in the nation without a 
posted daytime limit. 
</P>
<P>
	When Congress repealed the federal speed limits 3 1/2 years ago,  
Montana began operating under the so-called ``basic rule,'' a law 
requiring motorists to drive in a reasonable and prudent manner 
based on traffic, road and weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we liked it or not, it was like an invitation to  
people who wanted to come to Montana and really see how fast their 
vehicle could go,'' said Al Goke, chief of the state Traffic Safety 
Bureau. ``We became a testing ground for people who wanted that 
freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Support grew for restoring fixed limits after highway fatalities  
increased. In 1997, the state Legislature rejected a speed limit 
bill, but that was before the year ended with 265 fatalities -- the 
most deadly year since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, last December, the Montana Supreme Court declared  
unconstitutional the vague basic-rule requirement to drive at 
``reasonable and proper'' speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The top speed on interstate highways is now 75 mph day and  
night. The maximum on most two-lane roads is 70 mph during the day 
and 65 mph at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Craig Reap, chief of the Montana Highway Patrol, said  
enforcement of the new law will be neither lax nor especially 
strict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want the public perception to be that we finally got  
what we wanted and we're going out there to write a bunch of 
tickets and we're going to be hard on everybody,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the speed limit passed overwhelmingly in the  
Legislature this year, not everyone is happy with the change. 
</P>
<P>
	``It serves no useful purpose,'' said Michael Was of Bozeman,  
who had testified against the limits. ``The speed limit does not 
control people's driving to the point that it will affect the 
fatality rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The return of speed limits for cars and light trucks was  
prefaced by a state government campaign to get the word out. Its 
message was succinct: ``The sky is not the limit; 75 is.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Blasts US on Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia today accused the U.S. Congress of  
threatening world stability and encouraging another nuclear arms 
race with its efforts to develop an anti-ballistic missile system. 
</P>
<P>
	``This step is a direct challenge to strategic stability and  
international safety,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 21, the U.S. House of Representatives sent President Bill  
Clinton a Senate-modified bill that would commit the United States 
to a limited anti-ballistic missile defense system. Clinton is 
expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow is fiercely against the plan, which it says would violate  
the U.S.-Soviet 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. That agreement 
blocks either country from developing an anti-missile defense 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the United States says the latest proposal is aimed at  
defending U.S. soil from rogue states like North Korea, the Russian 
Foreign Ministry said Congress' move ``cannot be judged as anything 
but another step aimed at undermining the ABM treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States, with its actions concerning ABM, is  
stimulating the creation and proliferation in the world of more 
sophisticated rockets, capable of starting a new arms race,'' the 
ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	China has expressed similar concerns about the U.S. proposal.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Lifts Brit Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Manchester United has lifted English soccer back  
to the summit of Europe after a long, hard climb. And with their 
historic triple crown season, the Reds are being hailed as possibly 
the greatest English team ever. 
</P>
<P>
	United etched its place in English soccer folklore by beating  
Bayern Munich 2-1 in Barcelona on Wednesday night to win the 
European Champions Cup -- the world's most prestigious club title. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most dramatic finishes in cup history, United came  
from behind to win with two goals in the final 90 seconds of injury 
time by substitutes Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory completed an unprecedented sweep by an English club  
of the domestic league, F.A. Cup and European Cup titles in the 
same season -- something that even the great Liverpool teams of the 
late 1970s and early '80s never accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	British newspapers hailed the win as one of the greatest moments  
in English soccer history, with the Daily Mirror headline even 
calling it ``The Greatest 2 Minutes in the History of Sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of fans poured into the streets of Manchester to  
celebrate -- and half a million were expected to turn out to salute 
the players Thursday evening when they rode through the city in an 
open-top bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans waved banners and scarves and they arrived at the airport,  
many still in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Manchester described their resources as ``stretched to  
the limit'' as convoys of cars with flags flying filed around the 
city beeping their horns as thousands of people spilled out of bars 
and pubs to congratulate each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Ferguson's team became the first United club to lift the  
European trophy since since 1968, when Matt Busby was manager and 
George Best and Bobby Charlton were the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	That triumph came 10 years after the Munich air crash which  
killed eight players of the United team known as the ``Busby 
Babes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a powerful piece of symbolism, United's triumph Wednesday  
came on what would have been Busby's 90th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlton, who survived the Munich crash and is now a senior  
director of the club, wiped away tears as he watched the team's 
celebrations Wednesday night from the stands of the Camp Nou 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also helped erase some of the memories of another  
dark chapter in English soccer history. In 1985, 39 people died 
when English hooligans rioted before the Liverpool-Juventus 
European Cup final at Brussels' Heysel stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy resulted in English clubs being banned from European  
competition for five years. Since the ban was lifted, Manchester 
United (1991), Arsenal (1994) and Chelsea (1998) won the Cup 
Winners Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But, until this season, no English club had managed to progress  
to the Champions Cup final. The win over Bayern means English clubs 
are now tied with Italian sides with the most European Cup 
victories (9). 
</P>
<P>
	``English football has been in the wilderness for a long time  
and now we're back on the world stage,'' Charlton said. ``It's been 
all right saying English football is the healthiest and the best to 
watch, but you really need to have something to show for it and to 
win the Champions League, there's nothing bigger in world club 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Debate is already raging on whether this Manchester United team,  
which has won the Premier League title in five of the past seven 
seasons, is the greatest English club of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparisons are being made to the 1958 and 1968 United teams and  
to the Liverpool teams which won the European Cup four times (1977, 
1978, 1981 and 1984). Bob Paisley was the Liverpool manager during 
that era and his star players included Kenny Dalglish and Graeme 
Souness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always said we would never be judged as a great team until  
we had won the Champions League,'' winger Ryan Giggs said. ``We've 
done that now and I think we deserve to be ranked along with the 
Liverpool teams of the 80s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the credit goes to Ferguson, the 57-year-old Scot whose  
achievements rank alongside those of Paisley, Busby, Bill Shankly 
and Jock Stein. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson has claimed 12 major trophies since taking over at  
United in 1986 -- five league championships, four F.A. Cups, one 
league Cup, one Champions Cup and one Cup Winners Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	That total puts Ferguson only one behind Paisley, who won 13  
trophies at Liverpool. Ferugson also won 10 major trophies with 
Aberdeen, bringing his career total to 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson may soon become ``Sir Alex.'' It's now widely expected  
that he will receive a knighthood -- an honor that also went to 
Busby.

<HEADLINE> O'Hare May Offer Gambling Gateway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Got a long layover in Chicago and some  
extra change? 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Legislature this week approved a measure that  
allows casino gambling in Cook County, a bill Gov. George Ryan has 
said he will probably sign. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino's likely location is in Rosemont, just minutes from  
O'Hare International Airport, the world's second-busiest with 
200,000 passengers a day. Atlanta Hartsfield Airport is the 
busiest. 
</P>
<P>
	A Rosemont casino is sure to attract hordes of Chicagoans  
because it would be closer than other Illinois casinos, and 
Rosemont is accessible by the city's elevated trains. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be big, real big,'' said an excited Tony  
Matassa, who owns a sandwich shop not far from the airport. 
``Everybody coming over from the airport, the employees going in 
and out, they're all going to come and eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No other major U.S. air hub has a casino so close, though there  
are slot machines in the terminals at airports in Las Vegas and 
Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the opportunity to attract these visitors from across  
the nation who fly into O'Hare,'' said Peter Lombardi, executive 
director of the Rosemont Convention Bureau. ``If they're delayed 
two or three hours, they can hop in a cab or the train and be here 
in a minute. Then they can get back on a plane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the closest Illinois casino to Chicago is the Grand  
Victoria in Elgin, 15 miles west of Rosemont. It's not as easy to 
reach from the city or airport, and Grand Victoria officials fear a 
Rosemont casino will siphon off a big chunk of their business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a simple matter of convenience,'' general manager Pete  
Dominguez said. ``People will only go as far as they have to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether a casino near the airport will pull most of its money  
from travelers' wallets is open to debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland Heights, Mo., is a suburb of 25,000 people about a  
10-minute drive from the St. Louis airport. Like Rosemont, it has a 
thriving hospitality industry, with 1 million visitors a year 
staying in its hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, ``the casinos estimate perhaps 20 percent of their  
patrons come from outside of the immediate region,'' city 
administrator Mark Levin said. ``Most of the money comes from in 
and around the St. Louis metro area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But gambling critics disregard the notion that casinos attract  
tourists and help boost the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gambling really hasn't brought in tourism,'' said Steve Taylor  
of the anti-gambling organization Casino Watch. ``All you're 
getting is local convenience gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten casinos have been licensed to operate in Illinois. Only one  
licenseholder would be eligible to take advantage of the 
Legislature's action -- the owners of a failed riverboat casino in 
East Dubuque.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Baseball Future Shaky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Avoiding jail didn't free Darryl Strawberry  
to resume his baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees outfielder pleaded no contest to drug and  
solicitation charges Wednesday, but it's unclear if or when he will 
be reinstated to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next step is between major league baseball and Darryl,''  
said Yankees general manager Brian Cashman. ``After that issue is 
resolved, we will make a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was sentenced to 18 months of probation and ordered  
to undergo testing for drugs twice a week. He is prohibited from 
going within 100 feet of bars, required to complete more drug 
treatment and perform 100 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, he remains on leave from the Yankees and faces  
possible suspension as a multiple offender of baseball's drug 
aftercare program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that Darryl Strawberry's legal proceeding has been  
resolved, I will promptly review all of the facts and circumstances 
surrounding this matter in order to determine what action is 
appropriate under baseball's drug policy,'' commissioner Bud Selig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner added that he would consult with medical  
advisers from baseball, as well as the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre said he couldn't discuss Strawberry's  
status until baseball decides what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is about Darryl as a person,'' Torre said at Yankee  
Stadium. ``In my four years here, he has been nothing but a model 
citizen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ordering Strawberry to stay out of bars, Florida  
Circuit Judge Jack Espinosa Jr. asked local law enforcement 
officials to provide the athlete with a map of Tampa ``hot spots'' 
to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, accompanied by his wife, Charisse, and lawyer Joseph  
Ficarrotta, apologized outside Hillsborough County courthouse. He 
spoke from a handwritten statement before riding off in a white 
van. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his arrest April 14, the eight-time All-Star was  
in Tampa working out in hopes of making a comeback from colon 
cancer surgery in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``My recovery has not been easy,'' he said. ``I am, however,  
committed to it and now that I have finished chemotherapy and feel 
healthy, I'm looking forward to the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, 37, was charged with possession of 0.3 grams of  
cocaine and offering an undercover female police officer $50 for 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Strawberry nor his lawyer answered questions outside  
court. Ficarrotta said Strawberry pleaded no contest ``to get this 
matter behind us and to go forward with his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors insisted the outfielder did not get special  
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is his first criminal drug offense,'' said assistant  
state attorney Pam Bondi. ``That's why he was placed on probation 
with intensive drug treatment and community service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the arrest, Strawberry was placed on administrative  
leave that barred him from training or playing for the Yankees or 
any of their farm teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees have struggled at times this season, and Torre  
conceded there have been occasions that having Strawberry on the 
team might have helped. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you are losing games and leaving men on base, you tend to  
look for more bats,'' he said. ``There have been a few games where 
we could really use a left-handed bat off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``Straw is an imposing figure. He intimidates the opposition. It  
is a nice weapon to have.''

<HEADLINE> Money Funds Fall in Latest Week / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds increased by $1.06 billion to $858.04 billion, the 
Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category  
increased by $1.48 billion to $712.24 billion for the week ended 
Wednesday, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. 
Tax-exempt fund assets decreased by $421.8 million to $145.80 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds decreased by $3.88  
billion to $590.45 billion for the same period. Among institutional 
funds, taxable money market fund assets decreased by $4.09 billion 
to $541.25 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds increased by $213.7 
million to $49.20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.448 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.451 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.27 percent from 4.30 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield fell to 4.29 percent from 4.30 percent the previous 
week, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield fell to 4.36 percent from 4.39  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield was 
unchanged at 4.39 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
60 days, down from 61 days, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts remained unchanged from 
the previous week at 2.06 percent as of Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts was unchanged from the previous week at 0.91 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.12 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 4.13 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.39 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.37 
percent; 4.51 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 4.49 percent; and 
4.68 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 4.66 percent.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Fingered in Atheist Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A former office manager for Madalyn Murray  
O'Hair killed the missing atheist, her son and her granddaughter 
out of hatred and greed, according to an affidavit from an agent of 
the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit, unsealed Wednesday, for the first time presents  
the government's theory behind the mysterious disappearance of Mrs. 
O'Hair, Jon Garth Murray, and Robin Murray O'Hair in September 
1995. The three vanished from San Antonio along with $500,000 in 
gold coins. 
</P>
<P>
	David R. Waters, who faced a court hearing today in Austin on a  
weapons charge, orchestrated a plot to steal $600,000 from Mrs. 
O'Hair's United Secularists of America, the affidavit states. He 
has not been charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The document, citing a confidential informant, also states  
Waters had a deep hatred for the woman whose 1963 U.S. Supreme 
Court decision, along with a ruling the previous year, struck down 
organized prayer in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Waters ... expressed fantasies of killing Madalyn,'' the  
affidavit states. ``He spoke about seeing Madalyn suffer and 
snipping off her toes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waters' lawyer, Patrick Ganne, told the San Antonio Express-News  
on Wednesday that he hadn't seen the document. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Hair became famous in the 1960s with her battle to remove  
prayer from schools. She later tried to remove the phrase ``In God 
We Trust'' from U.S. currency and stop potential jurors from saying 
``so help me God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the O'Hairs vanished, authorities wondered whether they  
were victims of foul play or had merely run off with their 
organization's money. Others suggested that Mrs. O'Hair, who was 77 
and ailing, had gone off to die quietly so Christians wouldn't pray 
over her. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities, however, have recently suggested the O'Hairs'  
remains were buried in barrels, but two recent searches of a ranch 
near San Antonio failed to find either barrels or bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit from IRS special agent Edmund Martin names Waters,  
along with Gary Karr, now imprisoned in Detroit; Danny Fry, who was 
killed shortly after the O'Hairs vanished; and Gerald Lee Osborne 
of Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit was used in March to obtain a search warrant of  
Waters' Austin apartment. The search yielded, among other items, 
personal correspondence of Jon Murray, the document said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agent also stated that Waters was responsible for the death  
of Fry, whose headless, handless body was dumped in Dallas County 
two days after the O'Hairs vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an informant, Karr has talked about Waters  
committing four murders in Texas following a card game. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the card game, Waters drove four people involved in the  
card game back home. Waters killed them, took the jewelry (rings 
and Rolexes) off the bodies, and buried them in a field in Texas 
near a subdivision,'' read the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters used a Ford van rented by Karr to transport the bodies,  
and Karr told the informant that the persons killed included the 
O'Hairs, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters worked for Mrs. O'Hair in Austin in 1993 and 1994 and  
``was open about his dislike of the O'Hairs and made comments about 
harming Madalyn,'' the document said, citing an informant. 
</P>
<P>
	The informant said that after Waters pleaded guilty in May 1995  
to stealing money from the O'Hairs, Mrs. O'Hair wrote a long 
article in the American Atheist newsletter detailing his criminal 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in time, Waters had serious change of attitude  
regarding the O'Hairs,'' the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters met Karr when the two were cellmates in Illinois. Waters,  
who had served time for beating a teen-ager to death, was back in 
prison for assaulting his mother while Karr was in for kidnapping 
and armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Water was released in 1987. He quit as the office manager of  
American Atheists in 1993 and admitted stealing $54,000 from the 
group's accounts. Waters was given probation and ordered to repay 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Karr was freed in 1995, four months before the O'Hairs  
disappeared.

<HEADLINE> Reno Knocks Aides on China Wiretap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno faulted Justice  
Department and FBI subordinates Thursday for not coming to her two 
years ago with their disagreement over whether to wiretap a nuclear 
weapons scientist suspected of spying for China. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where there is something serious, where (FBI) Director (Louis)  
Freeh disagrees with the findings (of Justice officials), I think 
that it should be discussed at my level,'' Reno told her weekly 
news conference. ``I was not briefed on the details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno delivered her most detailed explanation yet of how the  
Justice Department handled allegations that a Taiwanese-born 
scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory may have given 
nuclear weapons secrets to China. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno's comments came after aides pleaded with her to rebut  
suggestions from Republican Richard Shelby of Alabama, the Senate 
intelligence committee chairman, and Democratic Sen. Robert 
Torricelli of New Jersey, usually a staunch defender of the Clinton 
administration, that she should resign or consider doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno explained that when the FBI first sought in 1997 to wiretap  
the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, the warrant application was rejected by 
Justice's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review. Working with 
Justice officials, the FBI reworked the application twice to add 
information, but it was still rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Through his attorney, Lee has denied spying. Lee was fired this  
spring and remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the facts reported to us in 1997, the department  
determined that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding 
of probable cause'' to believe Lee engaged in clandestine 
intelligence-gathering on behalf of a foreign power, Reno said. 
That is the standard required by the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act of 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said then-Assistant FBI Director John Lewis complained  
about that decision to her without going into details, so she asked 
Justice's Executive Office for National Security to review it. 
Daniel Seikaly of that office agreed with the earlier decision and 
told the FBI, Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seikaly never took the matter up with Reno or Deputy Attorney  
General Eric Holder, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I assumed since I did not hear again from the FBI that it was  
resolved to their satisfaction,'' Reno said. Freeh has never been 
shy about appealing department rulings to Reno, as Justice 
officials noted privately. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking back now at the evidence available in 1997, the career  
lawyers were correct to reject the wiretap, Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the continuing disagreement had been brought to her, she  
said, ``I would have asked the FBI to go back and look at their 
records to see if there was additional information that could be 
utilized to show probable cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what the end result would have been, but I do  
know we would have ... done everything we could to see if probable 
cause could be developed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI itself had some reservations about whether the evidence  
was sufficient, according to a senior bureau official, who 
requested anonymity. Agents basically had three facts: the Energy 
Department listed Lee among officials who had access to W-88 
nuclear warhead data obtained by China, Lee had traveled to China 
to give lectures, and he had once telephoned another laboratory 
scientist under suspicion of spying, this official has said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Republican congressional source said FBI officials left  
the impression on Capitol Hill that they felt they did have 
probable cause. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998 the FBI mounted a ``false flag'' operation in which  
undercover FBI agents posed as Chinese spies and tried to get Lee 
to spy for them, but Lee would not, according to other law 
enforcement officials. And Lee's wife reported that contact to U.S. 
authorities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she has not thought about resigning and was told by  
White House Counsel Charles Ruff that she has President Clinton's 
confidence. She has named a senior career prosecutor to review the 
Lee case.

<HEADLINE> Longer Trading Approved for Nasdaq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Come autumn, investors could be buying and  
selling shares of Microsoft Corp. and 99 other companies on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market while watching Ally McBeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers, which governs  
Nasdaq, on Thursday approved a plan to extend trading hours from 
the current 9:30 a.m.-4 p.m. Eastern time schedule. A second 
session of the day would likely start at 5:30 p.m. and end at 9 
p.m. or 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are expected to take effect around September, after  
a review by the Securities and Exchange Commission and discussions 
with industry leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``This business of extended hours is a serious market-quality  
question, and it needs to be addressed with a great deal of 
seriousness,'' said Frank Zarb, chairman and chief executive of the 
National Association of Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has been urging restraint, proposing a delay until next  
year so that the securities industry would not be extending trading 
hours at the same time it is confronting the Year 2000 computer bug 
and preparing to shift from reporting stock prices in fractions to 
the use of decimals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zarb said Nasdaq is still sticking with its plans for  
starting night trading around September. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear the marketplace needs this kind of innovation, and  
we are going to provide the leadership to get us from here to 
there,'' Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	The groundbreaking decision, which could throw many Wall Street  
companies into chaos, is being made to accommodate the growing 
number of investors who trade at home over the Internet. But the 
securities industry, especially smaller firms, will have to find 
ways for brokers and backroom recordkeepers to accommodate the 
nighttime business. 
</P>
<P>
	In a poll for the CNBC financial cable news channel, 53 percent  
of active investors 21 years of age or older liked the idea of 
trading well into the evening, while 31 percent opposed the move. 
The poll of more than 500 people and had a margin of error of plus 
or minus 4.4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, trading would be limited to Nasdaq's 100 largest,  
nonfinancial companies, led by Microsoft and including such other 
well-known stocks as Intel Corp., Northwest Airlines Corp. and MCI 
WorldCom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks would still have a final, closing price reported at the 4  
p.m. end of the daytime session. Any after-hour trades would count 
toward the following day's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities subject to stock splits, or stock dividends would be  
suspended from trading in the evening session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are calling on the industry to do the right thing, to  
coordinate and be responsible and move in unison so the investor 
can be properly protected in the new world of extended hours,'' 
Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement after the vote, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said  
the SEC supports ``investor choice in trading hours. Before 
widespread trading begins outside of regular hours, however, a 
number of investor protection and market integrity issues need to 
be addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those issues include broad distribution of stock price data and  
the capacity of computer systems to handle the trading load. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange  
said the Big Board also is considering a plan to extend its trading 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the traditional markets are facing increased competition  
from overseas exchanges, which often trade shares of U.S.-based 
companies, and from alternative computer-based exchanges in the 
United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Zarb acknowledged that he has been approached by New  
York city and state officials about moving into part of the new 
facility that is being built for the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Unconcerned About Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Departing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said  
Wednesday he is not worried that President Clinton's nomination of 
Lawrence Summers to head Treasury could be held up by some senators 
who want the administration to do more to protect the U.S. steel 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence of that I've seen whatsoever,'' Rubin  
said in response to a reporter's question. ``I know of no such 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar briefly lost ground against the Yen on Tuesday  
after a spokesman for Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said DeWine was 
considering blocking Summers' nomination, which the Senate must 
approve. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman, Charlie Boesel, later retracting the comment,  
saying he had misstated DeWine's position. 
</P>
<P>
	``My recollection ... was that somebody raised the issue about a  
particular senator and that senator, I think, said while he's 
concerned about the issue, that was not his intention'' to block 
Summers' nomination, Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution Rests in Police Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors in a federal police brutality trial  
ended their case Thursday by showing the jury the whisk half of a 
broken broomstick -- the other half of which, they said, was used to 
torture a Haitian immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	The closing came the same week that one of the defendants  
dropped out of the trial after pleading guilty to the attack, a 
move that the jury was informed of by the trial judge, who denied 
motions to declare a mistrial for the remaining defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	In final prosecution testimony on Thursday, Lt. Vincent DiDonato  
said the broken broom was found during a search of the stationhouse 
six days after Abner Louima was sodomized in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators never recovered the stick used in the attack,  
which shocked the city for its alleged brutality and has strained 
police relations with minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Alan Vinegrad walked in front of the jury box holding  
up the broken broom before announcing that the prosecution was 
resting after a month of testimony by 50 witnesses and a dramatic 
guilty plea by the lead defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, defense attorney Stephen Worth described the  
finale as ``a prosecutorial cheap shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a technique called waving the bloody shirt,'' he said.  
``There absolutely no proof that this is the other half of the 
notorious stick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Officer Justin Volpe shook the trial by  
pleading guilty to civil rights charges. He could be sentenced to 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, 27, admitted ramming a stick into a handcuffed Louima's  
rectum, pulling it out and putting it up to his face to humiliate 
him. He said he mistakenly believed the prisoner had punched him 
when police tried to quell a disturbance outside a nightclub in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Charles Schwarz faces the most serious charge among the  
remaining four defendants -- that he held Louima, 32, down in the 
bathroom assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz and Officers Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder also are  
charged with beating Louima in a patrol car en route to the police 
precinct. Sgt. Michael Bellomo, their supervisor, is charged with 
covering up the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resumes Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Ruling Party Office Burned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- An office of the ruling Golkar Party  
was set on fire today in the worst attack on the party since 
campaigning for Indonesia's June 7 parliamentary elections began 
eight days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze broke out in the two-story building in North Aceh,  
just hours before tens of thousands of rallying opposition-party 
supporters choked the streets of Jakarta, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said six people set the building on fire with gasoline  
after warning a guard to run away. No one was injured in the fire, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are searching for the culprits and continue to investigate  
it,'' police Lt. Col. Iskandar Hasan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The northwestern province of Aceh, 1,100 miles northwest of  
Jakarta, is embattled by a violent separatist movement. National 
election officials said Wednesday that balloting in Aceh could be 
postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, former President Suharto delivered a letter to the  
attorney general's office today giving government investigators 
permission to search for and seize any money of his they found 
stashed away in foreign bank accounts. He also repeated his 
contention that he has no money overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Suharto, 77, has been the target of allegations over his wealth  
since he quit following protests and riots a year ago. The 
allegations have become a major issue in the campaign for a new 
Parliament that will help select a head of state later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Two government officials will leave Sunday for Europe to check  
into allegations in a recent Time magazine article that Suharto and 
his family amassed $15 billion during his 32 years in office and 
recently transferred $9 billion from Switzerland to an account in 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Golkar was Suharto's party and dominated politics under his  
tight-fisted rule, regularly winning elections amid claims of 
vote-rigging. It now is lagging in opinion polls, largely because 
of its links with Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition parties have accused President B.J. Habibie,  
Suharto's hand-picked successor and Golkar's presidential 
candidate, of wanting to protect the former leader and going soft 
on him in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Golkar vehicles have been vandalized, and Golkar flags  
have been burned in Jakarta, where the party has been keeping a low 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
	In the capital, huge crowds of flag-waving supporters of the  
National Mandate Party and the Justice Party paraded down the 
city's main boulevard on the tops of buses and the backs of trucks 
and motorcycles. It was the third time in eight days that the 
streets were filled with opposition supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, rallies by Golkar in Jakarta a few days ago fizzled  
with low turnouts. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no signs of the election campaign in Aceh's oil- and  
gas-rich town of Lhokseumawe. Less that 50 percent of eligible 
voters have registered in the province, where separatist rebels are 
campaigning for a boycott of the election. 
</P>
<P>
	Home Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid said Wednesday that  
balloting in Aceh could be postponed because of a lack of voters 
and outbreaks of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, six people were killed in two separate attacks in  
the troubled province on the island of Sumatra. Separatists are 
suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	A small group of rebels has been fighting for a separate Islamic  
state in Aceh since the 1970s. The Indonesian military has cracked 
down hard on separatists, and rights groups have accused the army 
of killing and torturing hundreds of people.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Growers Emphasize Quality / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Quality -- not quantity -- is the watchword  
for the Pacific Northwest's wheat industry this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a global wheat glut sent prices plunging for the  
second year running, leaving grain piled up outside some storage 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Northwest growers hope to rebound by recapturing  
export market share lost in recent years to Australia, Canada, the 
European Union and Argentina, and by making inroads into the newly 
opened Chinese market. 
</P>
<P>
	That requires convincing increasingly picky overseas buyers that  
Northwest wheat is fine for everything from cookies in Korea to 
noodles in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quality issue is growing in importance exponentially,''  
says Bob Drynan, executive director of the Portland, Ore.-based 
Wheat Marketing Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers are striving to produce wheat with the levels of  
protein, ash and gluten strength customers want. Too much or too 
little of one element can make a cookie crumble or a noodle go 
limp. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyer preferences are tied to economic conditions in key export  
markets such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Pakistan and 
Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	``As economies mature and consumers have more disposable income,  
a person's tastes become more sophisticated,'' said Christopher 
Shaffer, a fifth-generation Walla Walla wheat farmer and vice 
chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates, the industry's export promotion 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northwest wheat industry's quality campaign also involves  
keeping batches with specific characteristics segregated during 
storage and shipping. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, growers have lost out on export sales due to  
blending of different batches of soft white wheat, the most common 
type grown in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest problem has been that we have wheats that are good  
for one thing, but not for another, but we've blended them 
together,'' Drynan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a whole revolution in that we're no longer looking at  
wheat as a bulk product,'' Shaffer added. ``Every variety has 
different characteristics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing also is a key to the quality campaign in the  
Northwest, where about 85 percent of the 330 million bushels of 
wheat typically harvested each summer is exported. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States remains the world's biggest wheat exporter.  
But U.S. shipments have remained flat over the past six years while 
exports from competing nations have risen. 
</P>
<P>
	After the late summer harvest, officials like Drynan and Shaffer  
will travel overseas on marketing tours armed with brochures 
containing the results of an annual wheat quality survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 600 farmers in Washington, Oregon and Idaho this summer are  
expected to provide wheat samples from their fields. Wheat 
Marketing Center technicians will analyze the samples and compile 
results describing characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign has additional importance this year because of a  
new export market available to Northwest growers. In April, China 
opened its market to Northwest wheat for the first time since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping to beef up our education efforts there on what  
our wheat has to offer,'' Shaffer said.

<HEADLINE> Homeschooled Boy Wins Geography Bee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Much of what David Beihl has learned about the  
world, he's learned at home. Those lessons paid off when he became 
the first homeschooled student to win the National Geography Bee. 
</P>
<P>
	He won Wednesday by correctly answering that ``La Nina'' is the  
Spanish name for the weather condition characterized by unusually 
cold ocean temperatures in the equatorial region of the eastern 
Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had lots of time to study. My schedule is more flexible  
than some other schools,'' said David, 13, of Saluda, S.C., He has 
been taught at home since kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
	David's brother, Tom, 11, and sister, Debbie, 9, are also taught  
at home by their mother, Penny Beihl, 39, who has a master's degree 
in elementary and secondary education. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live way out in the country,'' said his father, Gary Beihl,  
39, who commutes an hour each way to his engineering job with Intel 
in Columbia, S.C. ``It makes us closer as a family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David outlasted Jason Borschow, a 13-year-old eighth-grader at  
Saint John's School in Condado, just outside San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
Jason answered ``El Nino,'' to the weather question in the 
championship round of the National Geographic Society's nationwide 
geography competition. However, the word's male gender 
characterizes warm weather conditions, said moderator Alex Trebek, 
who usually serves as host of the television game show 
``Jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be calm and not blurt the answer out. You have to  
take your time and consider all the possibilities,'' said Jason, a 
three-time finalist who admitted that in the end he did not follow 
his own advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Jason and David were returning participants to the annual  
competition. Jason represented Puerto Rico last year and in 1997. 
David represented South Carolina last year. 
</P>
<P>
	They were among the 10 to make the finals Wednesday in the 11th  
annual competition at the society's Washington headquarters. The 
field was narrowed from 55 on Tuesday. Each contestant represented 
fourth- to eighth-graders from each state, the District of 
Columbia, Department of Defense Schools and each of the five U.S. 
territories. More than 5 million students ages 10 to 15 competed in 
their schools and states earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	David received a $25,000 scholarship from the society and a  
seven-day trip to Sydney, Australia, from this year's corporate 
sponsor, Bank One. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason got a $15,000 scholarship for second place. Tanveer Ali,  
13, an eighth-grader from Flint, Mich., won $10,000 for his 
third-place finish. He attends Carman-Ainsworth Junior High School 
in Flint. 
</P>
<P>
	David correctly answered all three championship round questions,  
while his opponent answered just two. In addition to the La Nina 
question, David correctly answered ``Dhaka'' when asked, ``In 1998, 
a bridge across the Jamuna River was completed about 65 miles 
northwest of what capital city?'' Dhaka is the capital of 
Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
	And he accurately responded, ``Honduras,'' when quizzed on which  
Central American country is the only one with direct access to the 
Pacific Ocean through the Gulf of Fonseca. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always makes us sweat bullets,'' joked Gary Beihl, who  
attributed the success of his son to homeschooling. David will 
remain in Washington for next week's Scripps Howard National 
Spelling Bee. A 13-year-old New York girl educated at home won the 
spelling bee in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The geography bee's final contest was close as many of the  
youngsters answered several questions before being eliminated. At 
one point, Trebek joked that he would run out of questions before 
contestants. 
</P>
<P>
	The other finalists from Wednesday's rounds received $500.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Drop on Inflation Jitters / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds fell for a second session Thursday despite  
another exodus of money from stocks, as the appeal of safer 
fixed-income investments was outweighed by inflation worries. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/8 point,  
or $6.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 5.84 percent from Thursday's 5.80 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasurys fell 5/32 to 7/32 point, while  
intermediate maturities fell between 11/32 point and 17/32 point, 
reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	The market failed to benefit from a steep selloff in stocks,  
which often sends investors searching for a haven such as 
Treasurys. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks fell  
235.23 points, or by 2.2 percent, to 10,466.93 amid mounting fears 
of rising inflation and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Those concerns, sparked by worries the economy is growing too  
fast, also pressured bonds, which are less attractive when prices 
are rising quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, the Commerce Department reported Thursday that the  
biggest consumer spending spree in 11 years kept the economy 
growing at a robust rate of 4.1 percent in the year's first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In other fixed-income trading on Thursday, yields on three-month  
Treasury bills slipped to 4.63 percent, while the discount fell 
0.01 percentage point from Wednesday to 4.51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields rose to 4.81 percent as the discount rose 0.02  
percentage point to 4.63 percent, and one-year yields rose to 4.96 
percent as the discount rose 0.05 percentage point to 4.71 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.87 1/2 percent, up from 4.81 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/4 point to 121 5/8. The average yield to 
maturity rose to 5.39 percent from late Wednesday's 5.37 percent.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 235.23 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled Thursday as renewed worries of  
inflation and higher interest rates sent the market back into its 
retreat from record heights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 235.23, a 2.2 percent  
loss, to close at 10,466.93. It was the ninth-worst one-day point 
drop ever, and the steepest since Sept. 30, 1998, when the 
blue-chip average fell 237.20. But in percentage terms, it was far 
from a record decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators also fell, although their losses were  
comparatively modest. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 23.35 to 
1,281.41, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 8.03 to 2,419.15. 
</P>
<P>
	Just this week, the Dow has tumbled 362.35 points, or by 3.3  
percent. The steep selloff Thursday made the previous day's 
171.07-point gain seem like a distant memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday's market looked really good, but without a  
follow-through, it's hard for stocks to pick up steam,'' said Barry 
Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the selling came from investors cashing in on  
Wednesday's rally in advance of the Memorial Day weekend. But the 
strongest factor, analysts said, was the continuing fear that a 
rekindling of inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	New government figures on the economy kept the market off  
balance Thursday. The Commerce Department said the U.S. economy 
grew at a robust annual rate of 4.1 percent in the first quarter, 
exacerbating fears that the Fed will raise rates to prevent the 
economy from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	That depressed bond prices, sending the yield of 30-year  
Treasurys rising to 5.84 percent from 5.80 percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department report also revealed news that could  
have heartened the market. An inflation gauge tied to the gross 
domestic product rose a modest 1.1 percent, and corporate profits 
showed a big rebound in the first three months of this year. 
Profits rose at an annual rate of $31.8 billion after having fallen 
at a rate of $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But David Orr, chief economist at First Union Capital Markets,  
pointed out that the fourth quarter included $13.5 billion in 
lawsuit settlements by tobacco companies. Without those crushing 
payments, the increase in profits would have been much more modest.

<P>
	Corporate profits have loomed in the background of the  
interest-rate watch. Higher rates typically cut into profits as it 
becomes more expensive for companies to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which soared more than 15 points Wednesday before a 2-for-1  
stock split that took effect at the close of trading, fell 2 1/8 on 
Thursday to 116. Some analysts also blamed persistent worries that 
computer makers will see their profit margins shrink as they cut 
prices to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank and brokerage stocks, which typically suffer when interest  
rates rise, were mostly lower. J.P. Morgan, a component of the Dow, 
lost 3 3/4 to 135 1/8 and Wells Fargo fell 2 1/8 to 39 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	And cyclical stocks -- those with fortunes tied to swings in the  
economy -- fell as investors locked in gains from a recent upward 
surge. 3M, down 2 13/16 to 86, and Caterpillar, down 2 7/16 to 55 3/8, 
were among the worst-performing Dow cyclicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts attributed the Nasdaq's stronger performance to  
bargain-hunting following a sharp selloff of Internet stocks early 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those stocks had been already been beaten up pretty badly, so  
today, they're resisting the decline of the rest of the market,'' 
said Robert Robbins, senior vice president and market strategist at 
Robinson-Humphrey Co. Inc. of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, investors sent many Internet companies lower again,  
choosing instead to buy high-tech veterans like Intel, which rose 1 
7/16 to 53 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-6 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume totaled 978.9 
million shares, compared with 1.06 billion in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 10.82 to 614.02, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index dropped 8.27 to 774.39. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.49 to 432.92. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.33 percent.  
Germany's DAX index closed 2.3 percent lower, Britain's FT-SE 100 
fell 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 ended 1.1 percent lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday morning, trading in General Motors stock will reflect the  
spinoff of its Delphi Automotive Systems unit. GM, which closed 
Thursday at 82 7/8, will open at 68 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Former NYC Mayor: I'm for Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Former New York City Mayor Ed Koch, who  
supported Al Gore the last time he ran for president, said Thursday 
he does not believe the vice president can win the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Koch said, ``If I had to vote tomorrow, I'd vote for  
(former New Jersey Sen. Bill) Bradley,'' Gore's only declared 
Democratic rival. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Koch remarks alone might not be troubling for Gore  
loyalists, there has been increasing concern in recent weeks among 
some of the vice president's current supporters that his campaign 
is lagging. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Koch's comments, Gore campaign spokesman Roger  
Salazar said that ``as people get to know more about Al Gore, we 
think they'll respond to that and we feel very confident that he's 
going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Koch was one of Gore's major supporters as the  
presidential campaign headed into the New York primary. But after 
then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis swept that contest, Gore 
bowed out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Gore ``a nice guy,'' Koch said ``the reason I don't  
think he can get elected is that he can't separate himself from 
President Clinton's record, the good and the bad.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Tightens Up on Tech Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate easily approved legislation  
Thursday to expand congressional oversight of technology exports 
and to tighten security at weapons laboratories in the aftermath of 
a report alleging Chinese espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	But efforts by the House to take up its own package, including  
many recommendations from that report, ran into partisan bickering 
that prompted House Speaker Dennis Hastert to abruptly postpone 
action until next month. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the Senate adopted a set of proposals by Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that was also endorsed by Senate 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	The package, added to a $288.8 billion defense spending bill,  
would expand the role of intelligence agencies in reviewing export 
licenses, boost Pentagon monitoring of satellite launches in China 
and require the administration to report to Congress on any 
security breaches. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also put the FBI solely in charge of all background  
investigations of workers at Energy Department weapons 
laboratories. And it recommends that the administration and 
Congress work together to provide financial incentives for 
expanding the domestic commercial satellite-launch industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the Senate's show of bipartisanship, House debate  
on tightening controls got off to a rocky start, with both sides 
hurling accusations of partisan grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior Democrat on the espionage panel, Rep. Norman Dicks of  
Washington, accused Republican leaders of blocking consideration of 
some of the panel's recommendations that are supported by the 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those was a measure to register support for steps already  
taken and being planned by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to 
increase security at nuclear weapons labs. The Energy Department's 
nuclear weapons lab in Los Alamos, N.M., was a target of alleged 
Chinese espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Dicks said, the House was only being allowed to debate  
Republican-endorsed proposals. ``It's an insult,'' Dicks said. ``I 
am very disappointed that the Republican leadership has chosen to 
take a partisan approach to implementing our report. We spent nine 
months working on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans denied they were trying to stifle debate.  
</P>
<P>
	But GOP leaders postponed action on the package when it became  
clear that there were also a number of Republican defectors who 
wanted stronger restrictions on the administration's ability to 
continue the military conflict in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to continue debate, the House adjourned for a week-long  
Memorial Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of the espionage  
investigation, later told reporters Dicks should have been allowed 
to present his amendment and suggested there had been a 
misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``silver lining,'' Cox said, is that the House now will have  
more time to work out a more comprehensive package of legislation 
to deal with technology exports to China and tightening security at 
weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	As in the Senate, the House had planned to deal with the  
China-espionage measures as part of debate on a bill authorizing 
various Defense programs for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Democrats protested that the ground rules for debate  
wouldn't allow them to bring up Democratic proposals on China, 
Republican conservatives objected to a leadership decision to drop 
a provision by the House Armed Services Committee to ban use of 
funds for the military operation over Kosovo after Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders said they had done so to ease administration  
concerns that such language would undermine U.S. troops in the 
Balkans -- and blamed Democratic leaders for causing the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that they blame Democrats for not fixing  
problems that they themselves created,'' said House Democratic 
leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	While the proposals by Lott sailed through the Senate after  
winning the support of Daschle and other key Democrats, senators 
were deeply divided on several proposals for more extensive 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska,  
proposed creating a new assistant secretary for defense programs in 
the Energy Department who would report directly to the president, 
and would be authorized to bypass the energy secretary in dealing 
directly with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, the energy secretary, opposed the proposal as too  
extensive and, in a letter to Senate leaders, complained ``this 
proposal would effectively cancel my six-month effort to strengthen 
security.'' He said he would threaten a veto if it were adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	Murkowski said, ``This is an effort to establish  
accountability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bills are H.R. 14001 and S1059

<HEADLINE> US OKs Moving Poor To Managed Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The federal government has given the state  
permission to move 1.5 million Medicaid recipients in New York City 
into managed care health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The switch from traditional fee-for-service based plans was  
advocated by both Gov. George Pataki and New York Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani as a way to improve care for the poor and reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also means Medicaid recipients could face fewer choices in  
physicians and other care providers. 
</P>
<P>
	About 650,000 of the state's 3.5 million Medicaid recipients are  
already enrolled in managed care programs; in 1997, the federal 
government granted approval to add eight upstate New York counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki had long sought federal approval to force New York City  
recipients into managed care. They will be added over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki has complained that New York has the highest Medicaid  
cost in the country at about $24 billion.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Want In On Regional Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Airlines could be on a collision course with  
their pilots unions as the industry debates whether to fly more of 
the regional jets that are increasingly popular with travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots unions worry about what an increased emphasis on regional  
jets will mean for the future and fear airlines will use such jets 
to replace larger planes, which pilots are paid more to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	But United Airlines this week became the latest carrier to seek  
union permission to sharply increase regional jet purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Airlines are ordering them in large numbers because the  
customer clearly likes them over turboprops,'' United spokesman Joe 
Hopkins said Thursday. ``Since regional jets are important feeders 
into our hub cities, we do want to maintain parity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regional jets usually seat no more than 70 people and have  
become popular tools for airlines to ferry consumers from small- 
and medium-size cities to large airports. Passengers prefer those 
planes over noisy turboprops because of their speed and perceived 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest pilots went on strike last year in part over concerns  
of losing pilot jobs because Northwest was buying and leasing 
smaller regional jets to Mesaba Airlines, its Airlink partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviation analysts say unions must realize the disadvantages of  
limiting regional jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have more (regional jet) feeds, then you have more  
traffic that can fill up your aircraft,'' said Brian Harris at 
Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots unions for United, American Airlines, Northwest Airlines,  
Trans World Airlines and US Airways earlier this decade negotiated 
contracts that limit the number of regional jets a carrier or its 
contract subsidiary can fly. Such agreements are called ``scope 
clauses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America West, Delta Air Lines and Continental do not limit the  
number of regional jets, although they do have restrictions on the 
number of seats on a plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Elk Grove Village-based United proposed allowing its commuter  
partners to fly up to 284 small jets instead of 65. The plan comes 
as a new study commissioned by more than a dozen airports warned 
that labor's restrictions on such moves hamper competition in 
smaller cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by GKMG, a Washington-based airline consulting group,  
concluded 1,452 unserved markets could sustain regional jet service 
but restrictions bar service to 800 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Line Pilots Association criticized the report, noting  
that many of the airlines base their decisions about flying 
regional jets on the potential for profits rather than whether a 
city can support service. 
</P>
<P>
	Major carriers handle commuter jet service in different ways,  
requiring decisions to be made on a case-by-case basis, said Capt. 
Madison Walton, a spokesman for United's pilots union chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines owns its commuter jet division, while  
Northwest owns the planes and leases them to others and Delta has a 
stake in its commuter partners. 
</P>
<P>
	United contracts with regional carriers that operate under the  
United Express banner, agreements that could leave the majority 
employee-owned carrier vulnerable at the end of those contracts, 
Walton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an acknowledgment of the value of feeds into our hubs  
being able to grow the airline,'' he said. ``But the concern is 
that the Express carriers basically have control, and the economics 
of whether we should continue that, buy our own planes with 
corporate capital or take a greater (financial) interest in Express 
carriers has to be considered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walton said the pilots' Master Executive Council had no  
timetable for making a decision on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier hopes to reach agreement by March, the deadline for  
United Express carriers to exercise delivery options for additional 
regional jets.

<HEADLINE> Indy 500 Champ a Man in Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eddie Cheever was sitting in front of his  
garage at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, autographing a stack of 
pictures on fan day, when a man walked up with his young son. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the guy who won the race last year,'' the father told  
his son, who gazed up at the driver with reverence. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever, the journeyman-turned-defending champion, seized the  
moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the man who's going to win the race this year,'' he  
quipped with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a witty retort, but Cheever seriously relishes the  
thought of joining an elite group that includes Wilbur Shaw, Mauri 
Rose, Bill Vukovich and Al Unser Sr. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every fiber in my body wants to win this race again,'' said  
Cheever, who will start from the inside of sixth row for the Indy 
500 on Sunday. ``Only a few guys have won the 500. Even less have 
won it two times in a row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever and the other 32 starters will make their final tune-up  
for the race today in a two-hour practice known as ``Carburetion 
Day,'' the only time between the end of qualifying and the race 
they're allowed on the 2 1/2-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Cheever was very much in demand Wednesday  
afternoon as thousands of fans converged on the speedway for 
``Community Day,'' taking advantage of a chance to mingle with the 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	A long line queued up at Cheever's garage for his hour-long  
autograph session, stretching around the building for him to sign 
pictures, hats, shirts, bricks, helmets and ticket stubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life changes after you win the 500,'' said Glenn Barton, who  
collected Cheever's autograph with his two young sons. ``He's a 
historical figure now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever refused to concede that the title of Indy 500 champion  
has lost its luster in recent years, despite all evidence to the 
contrary. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the 4-year-old war between the Indy Racing League and its  
more established rival, Championship Auto Racing Teams, has divided 
the open-wheel competition as NASCAR is booming in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cheever's aching right hand told a different story -- ``I've  
been signing stuff nonstop since I got to Indy'' -- and he's treated 
more reverently by the fans. People who used to call him ``Eddie'' 
now refer to him as ``Mr. Cheever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Eddie better,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In his younger days, Cheever was perceived as aloof and maybe a  
bit arrogant, the product of racing in the tunnel-vision world of 
Formula One from 1978-89. Now, at 41, he's a kinder, gentler man 
going through life at 220 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot more patience than I used to have,'' said  
Cheever, who will start Sunday's race from the inside of the sixth 
row. ``I guess I found something I like, which is racing on ovals. 
It's ridiculous, too. My whole background is in road racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, from the devilish look in his hazel eyes, he's enjoyed  
the fruits of his Indy triumph, though he's a bit short of 
specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look, I'm a 41-year-old bachelor who's the Indy 500  
champion,'' Cheever said, grinning. ``That's all I'm going to say 
on that subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The more material benefits are harder to uncover, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Cheever's face didn't adorn a box of Wheaties after his Indy  
victory, nor did he land a big-time sponsorship for his self-owned 
team. In fact, the obscure potato chip company that backed him a 
year ago pulled most of its money. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Cheevermobile is supported by Children's Beverage  
Group, a little-known Texas company that makes packaging for kids' 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Barnes, president of a California marketing firm that  
works with a number of former 500 champions, said it's difficult to 
sell open-wheel racing to corporate America as long as there's a 
split between the IRL and CART. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie is a terrific spokesperson,'' Barnes said. ``I think  
he's capitalized as much as possible under the circumstances. 
Obviously, there's not as much focus on the Indy 500 as there used 
to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Cheever doesn't sound all that excited about talks  
to end the IRL-CART feud. Like a seasoned PR man, he quickly 
espouses the IRL's mantra of keeping costs under control, promoting 
competition and focusing on American-based oval racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``To even consider backing down from that philosophy so the IRL  
could incorporate another series would be a serious mistake,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Cheever has his eyes on other goals. He is trying to  
start his own NASCAR Winston Cup team, saying there's a 70-percent 
chance he'll be racing with the good ol' boys next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``See you next year at Daytona,'' a woman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cheever chuckled at the thought of a life going full circle.

<HEADLINE> Train Victim Feared Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A woman who led four of her children on  
a fatal walk along railroad tracks may have feared she was about to 
be deported, a police officer who knew the family said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fatal collision on the tracks was the first of two in the  
state this week. An unidentified man was struck and killed by a 
northbound Metro North train just after 9 p.m. Wednesday. A Metro 
North spokesman said the victim was apparently walking on the 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Julia Toledo and three of her sons, aged 3, 6 and 12, were  
killed at 2:20 a.m. Tuesday when they were hit from behind by an 
Amtrak train in Fairfield. A 10-year-old son remained in critical 
condition early today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her sister had threatened to have her deported,'' Police  
Officer Jose Reyes, who knew the family from his work in the local 
DARE program, said in today's editions of The Hartford Courant. 
``She was having problems with the sister to the point she had to 
move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends, he said, believe Toledo feared that her sister was  
trying to have her committed to a psychiatric facility and take 
guardianship of the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	``She didn't want her sister to know where she was staying,''  
Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach the sister, Maria Toledo, by phone and at her  
home were unsuccessful Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other pressures on Julia Toledo had been mounting recently. Her  
marriage was failing and her husband had returned to Ecuador. She 
quit her job after having trouble finding day care for her 
children, and she had left her apartment and moved into a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, officials have ruled the deaths of Toledo, 46, and her  
sons an accident, not suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was obviously fleeing, but we don't know why. We wished we  
had known she was in trouble, because we could have helped her,'' 
said Sister Brenda Lynch of Caroline House, an educational center 
for immigrant women where Toledo took English lessons and other 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said following train tracks is a common practice in Latin  
America. Also, Toledo may have believed it was safer to follow the 
tracks than walk through an impoverished neighborhood in the middle 
of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a direct way, the tracks. ... What she did would make  
sense to her,'' Lynch said.

<HEADLINE> Brand, Hamilton Added to U.S. Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- All-Americans Elton Brand and  
Richard Hamilton, who led their teams to the NCAA championship game 
last season, were added to the U.S. Olympic qualifying team 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also filling one of the final three spots on the roster was  
Wally Szczerbiak, of Miami (Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, AP's college basketball player of the year, led Duke to a  
37-2 record with 17.7 points and 9.8 rebounds a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, the NCAA tournament's outstanding player, helped  
Connecticut win its first national men's title. Joining Brand on 
the AP All-America team, the two-time Big East player of the year 
averaged 21.5 points a game for the Huskies, who went 34-2 and beat 
Duke for the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Brand, a sophomore, and Hamilton, a junior, have declared  
themselves eligible for this year's NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak, a second-team AP All-America choice and Brand's  
teammate in last summer's Goodwill Games, led Miami to a 24-8 
record and the third round of the NCAA tournament, where he 
averaged 30 points a game. In four years at Miami, Szczerbiak 
scored 1,847 points, the second-highest in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	Picked earlier for the U.S. team were NBA stars Vin Baker, Tim  
Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Tom Gugliotta. Tim Hardaway, Allan Houston, 
Jason Kidd, Gary Payton and Steve Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The squad will play in the Americas Olympic Qualifying  
Tournament in San Juan, Puerto Rico, July 14-25. Despite winning 
the last two Olympic tournaments, the United States must finish in 
the top two to win a berth in the 2000 Games in Sydney.

launch drought for NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.5 million-pound ship, carrying seven astronauts and a full

	The space station was soaring 235 miles over the Atlantic, due  
east of the Carolinas, when Discovery took off in pursuit. They're 
due to link up early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Because a space shuttle hadn't flown since December -- making  
this the longest gap between shuttle launches since the Challenger 
disaster -- NASA was especially vigilant during flight preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	The only major problem in the past month was hail, which  
pummeled Discovery's fuel tank and forced a one-week delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Its external fuel tank speckled with patches, Discovery holds  
more than 4,300 pounds of spare parts, tools, laptop computers and 
clothes for the station's first permanent residents, due to move in 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 10-day mission, Discovery's seven astronauts will not  
only haul supplies into the space station, they will also fix 
broken U.S. and Russian equipment and install mufflers to reduce 
the noise caused by clattering Russian fans. Two of them will also 
take a spacewalk to attach one crane and parts of another to the 
outside of the station. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first flight to the station since shuttle astronauts  
took up the second component in December and attached it to the 
first, which was already in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, commander Kent Rominger and his  
U.S.-Canadian-Russian crew will be the first to actually dock with 
the complex. Rominger, a Navy pilot, will pull up and dock the same 
way it was done during the shuttle-Mir program. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, an unmanned Russian rocket is scheduled to launch  
the next piece of the space station, a service module containing 
life-support systems. Then, NASA's space shuttle Atlantis is 
supposed to follow in December with more equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	However, everything is on hold until the Russian component --  
already more than 1 1/2 years behind -- is in orbit. And many question 
whether the Russians can finish building and testing it by 
November, given the country's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The repeated delays in the Russian service module caused the  
six-month gap in shuttle launches, as did ongoing problems with a 
NASA X-ray telescope that's supposed to be hoisted aboard the 
shuttle Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	To stay sharp, NASA's launch team conducted extra countdown  
practices during the hiatus and spent extra time reviewing 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	It paid off. Discovery's safe climb to orbit was a bright spot  
amid a number of recent failed launches of unmanned rockets. Three 
satellites ended up in useless orbits and another was vaporized 
shortly after launch, all since April. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, two satellites were destroyed in launch explosions  
last August. None of the six satellites belonged to NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery is due back June 6.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Down / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo stock market's main index slipped today  
in light trading as many institutional investors held back to 
assess recent corporate earnings announcements. The dollar edged 
higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.43 yen in the late afternoon, up 0.33 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level 
of 122.17 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 53.33 points,  
or 0.33 percent, closing at 16,177.19. On Wednesday, the average 
gained 16.29 points, or 0.10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Japanese companies have released earnings results for the  
last fiscal year, which ended March 31, with most of them posting 
declined profits amid the nation's worst recession since World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading today was somewhat choppy in the absence of fresh  
market-moving news, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market lacks energy to test higher levels,'' said Kazunori  
Jinnai, deputy general manager of the equity department at Daiwa 
Securities SB Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 396  
million shares, down from Wednesday's turnover of 452 million 
shares. Despite the Nikkei's fall, advancing issues outnumbered 
decliners 621 to 530, with 156 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 1.15 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,302.17 
points. The TOPIX closed down 5.36 points, or 0.41 percent, 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Disappointment that an overnight Wall Street rally did not spark  
a stronger move in Tokyo also pushed the Nikkei index down about 
200 points at one point in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 171.07  
points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,702.16 at Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar drifted higher against the yen  
on buying by Japanese institutional investors and overseas funds 
early in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders said the dollar's upward momentum later petered out  
because players were uncertain about its near-term direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 122.27 yen and 122.74 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 127.58 yen, down  
from 129.36 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.4950 percent from 1.4150 percent late Wednesday, 
driving its price down to 99.17 yen from 99.86 yen.

	APPLETON, Wis. (AP) -- Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator  
Fritz Shurmur has taken a leave of absence because of cancer, a 
newspaper reported Thursday. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery blasted off  
for the new international space station today, ending a six-month 
launch drought for NASA. The 4.5 million-pound ship, carrying seven 
astronauts and a full load of space station supplies, soared into a 
hazy sky at 6:49 a.m. as a brilliant yellow sun emerged above the 
horizon. During the 10-day mission, Discovery's seven astronauts 
will not only haul supplies into the space station, they will also 
fix broken U.S. and Russian equipment and install mufflers to

	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- In a major escalation in the battle

jets that crossed into its territory along the border. Kashmir, a 
Himalayan territory divided between India and Pakistan, is also the

The attacks came as Indian helicopter gunships launched fresh 
rocket attacks in Kashmir today, the second day of a campaign to 
dislodge Pakistan-backed guerrillas from the disputed frontier.

	Ex-Secretary Fingered in IBM Scam

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Authorities say 25 people pocketed more than  
$1.3 million from insider trading, a scheme that began with a 
former IBM secretary familiar with company expansion plans. The 
Securities and Exchange Commission said the illegal trades -- many 
by novices to the securities markets who did not even have accounts 
-- were touched off when Lorraine K. Cassano told her husband that 
International Business Machines Corp. was about to acquire Lotus 
Development Corp. Lotus stock jumped nearly 90 percent when the

<HEADLINE> Illegal Adoption Ring Broken Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two women were accused Thursday of running an  
illegal adoption ring that sold Mexican children to American 
families for $20,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 500 children may have smuggled over the Arizona  
border and delivered to adoptive parents, according to court 
documents. But several children, some of whom were as young as 2 
weeks old, had serious medical problems despite assurances they 
were healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene Lieberman, 48, and Arlene Reingold, 47, neighbors who  
live on New York's Long Island, and Mario Reyes, a Mexican lawyer 
with a home in Arizona, were charged with conspiracy to violate 
immigration laws in connection with 17 illegal adoptions in the 
Long Island area. They were also charged with mail and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Court documents said the women arranged more than 500 adoptions,  
but those adoptions are not being scrutinized as part of this case, 
assistant U.S. attorney Timothy Macht said. 
</P>
<P>
	Macht said he could not comment on how the children were  
obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes, 40, was arrested Wednesday night at his home in Douglas,  
Ariz., which abuts a Mexican border town called Agua Prieta where 
he had a law office. Each woman was released on $150,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum for the charges is 10 years in prison for each child  
illegally smuggled into the country. The wire and mail fraud charge 
carries a sentence of up to 5 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers allege that Reyes paid to have babies smuggled  
across the border to his Arizona home, sometimes by Mexican women 
posing as the children's mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of the children had serious medical problems.  
</P>
<P>
	One couple was presented with a 7-year-old girl who was mentally  
retarded, malnourished and also showed signs of sexual abuse. The 
couple, in their 50s, returned her to Mrs. Lieberman and never got 
a refund on their $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities repeatedly denied the pair's attempts to become  
licensed. The two women ran businesses called Stork International 
and International Adoption Consultants, presenting themselves as 
adoption information experts, state DSS officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lieberman's phone number is unlisted. A man who answered  
the phone at Mrs. Reingold's home had no comment. Calls placed to 
lawyers representing the women were not returned.

<HEADLINE> Longer Trading Approved for Nasdaq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Come autumn, investors could be buying and  
selling shares of Microsoft Corp. and 99 other companies on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market while watching Ally McBeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers, which governs  
Nasdaq, on Thursday approved a plan to extend trading hours from 
the current 9:30 a.m.-4 p.m. Eastern time schedule. A second 
session of the day would likely start at 5:30 p.m. and end at 9 
p.m. or 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are expected to take effect around September, after  
a review by the Securities and Exchange Commission and discussions 
with industry leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``This business of extended hours is a serious market-quality  
question, and it needs to be addressed with a great deal of 
seriousness,'' said Frank Zarb, chairman and chief executive of the 
National Association of Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has been urging restraint, proposing a delay until next  
year so that the securities industry would not be extending trading 
hours at the same time it is confronting the Year 2000 computer bug 
and preparing to shift from reporting stock prices in fractions to 
the use of decimals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zarb said Nasdaq is still sticking with its plans for  
starting night trading around September. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear the marketplace needs this kind of innovation, and  
we are going to provide the leadership to get us from here to 
there,'' Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	The groundbreaking decision, which could throw many Wall Street  
companies into chaos, is being made to accommodate the growing 
number of investors who trade at home over the Internet. But the 
securities industry, especially smaller firms, will have to find 
ways for brokers and backroom recordkeepers to accommodate the 
nighttime business. 
</P>
<P>
	In a poll for the CNBC financial cable news channel, 53 percent  
of active investors 21 years of age or older liked the idea of 
trading well into the evening, while 31 percent opposed the move. 
The poll of more than 500 people and had a margin of error of plus 
or minus 4.4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, trading would be limited to Nasdaq's 100 largest,  
nonfinancial companies, led by Microsoft and including such other 
well-known stocks as Intel Corp., Northwest Airlines Corp. and MCI 
WorldCom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks would still have a final, closing price reported at the 4  
p.m. end of the daytime session. Any after-hour trades would count 
toward the following day's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities subject to stock splits, or stock dividends would be  
suspended from trading in the evening session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are calling on the industry to do the right thing, to  
coordinate and be responsible and move in unison so the investor 
can be properly protected in the new world of extended hours,'' 
Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement after the vote, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said  
the SEC supports ``investor choice in trading hours. Before 
widespread trading begins outside of regular hours, however, a 
number of investor protection and market integrity issues need to 
be addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those issues include broad distribution of stock price data and  
the capacity of computer systems to handle the trading load. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange  
said the Big Board also is considering a plan to extend its trading 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the traditional markets are facing increased competition  
from overseas exchanges, which often trade shares of U.S.-based 
companies, and from alternative computer-based exchanges in the 
United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Zarb acknowledged that he has been approached by New  
York city and state officials about moving into part of the new 
facility that is being built for the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have looked at it and we have asked them for more  
information,'' he said, but added, ``Based upon what we know now, 
it's not our favorite option by a longshot.''

<HEADLINE> Dad in Kidnap Case May Plead Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A man accused of kidnapping his two young  
daughters 20 years ago and moving them to Florida will plead guilty 
in a plea bargain that will spare him jail time, the Boston Herald 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Fagan will enter a guilty plea to kidnapping on Friday,  
the newspaper reported, citing sources it did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan, 57, is accused of taking his two daughters from ex-wife  
Barbara Kurth in Massachusetts in 1979, moving them to Florida, 
telling them their mother was dead, and raising them under assumed 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan claims he rescued the girls from an unfit and alcoholic  
mother, a charge Kurth denies. 
</P>
<P>
	His daughters, Rachael and Lisa Martin, who are now in their  
20s, have steadfastly supported him since his arrest last year in 
Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan is expected to receive probation and pay a fine, the  
newspaper said. He was charged with two counts of kidnapping, each 
of which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurth's brother said in a phone interview with The Associated  
Press early today that he was aware discussions for a plea 
agreement were under way, but did not know details. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hadn't been told which way it would go,'' Peter Kurth said  
from his home in Burlington, Vt. ``I think she (Barbara) will be 
glad this aspect of it will be resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan's attorney, Richard Egbert, did not immediately return  
messages left at his home and office.

<HEADLINE> Biggio Irked at Dierker's Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Astros haven't been hitting well  
lately and All-Star second baseman Craig Biggio is tired hearing 
about it, even when the comments come from manager Larry Dierker. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 4-3 loss Thursday to Colorado, Dierker mentioned the  
Astros did not take advantage of their opportunities, adding that 
the team needed more than the four hits it got. 
</P>
<P>
	Biggio went 0-for-5 Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he wants to hit, let him hit,'' Biggio said. ``When we're  
scoring a lot of runs, nobody's complaining. But when we're not, 
everyone is saying `why, why, why.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we'll get our offense going in Pittsburgh and Larry  
will be hitting first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros left for Pittsburgh after the game to begin a 12-game  
road trip, their longest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker played down any hint of controversy. He said he'd have a  
conversation with Biggio on the road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't bother me, Biggio and I are fine,'' Dierker said.  
``It's a New York-type of thing where you say one thing and 
somebody goes to the player and says it a little different and 
things get confused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros have led the NL in hitting most of the season and  
they're still hitting .281 as a team. Against the Rockies, they 
scratched out three victories in the four-game series just hitting 
.223. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really haven't hit the last 6-7 games,'' Jeff Bagwell said.  
``We did have some opportunities today and just didn't get the big 
hit. It's been this way lately and we're still winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``That says a lot for our pitching staff. We win as a team and  
lose as a team. We just have to go battle. If we don't start 
swinging the bats a little better it's going to be a problem.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Fight Wine-Sales Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Through phone calls and meetings, lawmakers  
from wine-growing regions have been trying to persuade their 
colleagues to defeat a measure to limit mail-order and Internet 
sales of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision has been touted as a way to curb alcohol sales to  
minors, and its popularity is such that the Senate voted 80-17 to 
add it to a juvenile crime bill passed last week. Similar 
legislation is expected in the House shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision has split the alcohol industry. While the issue  
affects all alcohol products, winemakers eager to find new markets 
outside the distributorships have taken the lead in fighting the 
legislation. On the other side are the big wholesalers, which seek 
to maintain their control of sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states already have laws prohibiting intrastate shipments  
of alcohol, such as through the mail, but courts have ruled that 
the states cannot enforce the laws. The Senate-passed provision 
would allow states to go to federal court and seek an injunction 
blocking such sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the bill cast the dispute as an industry fight that  
the federal government should stay away from. Supporters say the 
federal government should act to prevent minors from buying alcohol 
through the Internet and prevent companies from evading state taxes 
and state laws by shipping their products directly to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a public policy issue regarding alcohol access, underage  
sales and taxation,'' said David Dickerson, vice president of the 
Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the charge on Capitol Hill against the measure is a  
group of 75 House members that calls itself the Congressional Wine 
Caucus. The bipartisan group includes lawmakers from wine-growing 
regions nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Radanovich, a third-term Republican who owns a  
central California winery that ships more than 4,000 cases a year, 
is one of them. He has been calling House Republican leaders to 
make the pitch against the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	He argues that the federal government should stay out of the  
matter and let the industry decide whether beer, wine and liquor 
can be sold directly to customers through the mail and Internet. 
Currently, the products are sold through distributorships. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working the leadership to convince them this is big  
business vs. small business and nothing more,'' Radanovich said. 
``The motivation behind this is big national distributors trying to 
kick small wineries out of the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., another member of the caucus, said  
that expanding sales over the Internet will allow wineries to find 
new markets. He said some New York wineries can't get their 
products distributed now. ``The old distribution system in wine is 
collapsing,'' Houghton said. ``It will collapse because of the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the lawmakers are so concerned about the potency of the  
issue of underage drinking that they are pushing their own bill. It 
would require that all packages containing alcohol be labeled and 
that someone age 21 or older be required to show identification and 
sign for the shipment if delivered by mail. The Senate juvenile 
crime bill contains such a provision. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are concerns, we are able and willing to meet those  
concerns,'' said Simon Siegl, president of the American Vintners 
Association, part of a coalition, calling itself Free the Grapes, 
which is supporting the lawmakers' efforts. Members of the vintners 
association gave $228,591 to federal candidates in 1997-98 and 
spent $40,000 on lobbying last year. Another coalition member, the 
Wine Institute, made $66,535 in contributions in the last election 
and spent $60,000 to lobby in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side are wine, beer and liquor distributors who  
have formed Americans for Responsible Alcohol Access. The Wine and 
Spirits Wholesalers of America spent $430,000 lobbying last year 
and made $275,809 in campaign contributions. The National Beer 
Wholesalers Association, which contributed $1.2 million to federal 
candidates during the last election cycle and spent $450,000 on 
lobbying in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Their coalition also includes the American Academy of Pediatrics  
and the National Safe Kids Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The House may have two opportunities to address the issue -- the  
provision is in the Senate-passed crime bill and Rep. Robert 
Ehrlich Jr., R-Md., plans to introduce separate legislation to 
limit mail sales.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Names Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes  
has chosen Ken Blackwell to be national chairman of his 
presidential campaign, making the Ohio secretary of state one of 
the highest-ranking blacks in the 2000 race. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwell will be a top spokesman and strategist for politics  
and policy, Forbes said in a joint interview with Blackwell on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an individual of true principle. He understands the  
principles of my campaign,'' Forbes said. ``Whether the issue is 
taxation or school opportunity, we've been on the same page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwell said he believes Forbes is the only candidate who can  
inspire hope, create opportunity and include minorities in his 
political coalition. ``Steve has always been an advocate for the 
politics of inclusion,'' Blackwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio secretary of state's office is responsible for  
certifying elections. Blackwell's spokesman Carlo LoParo said there 
was no conflict with Blackwell remaining as secretary of state 
while joining a presidential campaign. ``The integrity of the 
office should not be in question,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	LoParo said Blackwell also planned to remain as co-chairman of  
the Census Monitoring Board. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, R-N.Y., had 
called for his resignation because he signed on with Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwell, 51, was elected secretary of state in November after  
serving as Ohio's treasurer. He considered running for governor, 
but was persuaded by party leaders to keep the primary clear for 
Bob Taft, who went on to win the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
	He was regional chairman of Jack Kemp's 1988 Republican  
presidential campaign and also was county chairman for the 
presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan and George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	He gives Forbes an inroad in Ohio -- one of the battleground  
states of the presidential campaign. He also is one of the highest 
ranking minorities in any presidential campaign, Democratic or 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who campaigned for Blackwell in 1998, said the new  
chairman was one of the few GOP leaders who fought against a 
proposed sales tax increase in Ohio. 
</P>

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush formally opens  
an Iowa campaign office next week, with Wisconsin Gov. Tommy 
Thompson presiding over the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has not yet started campaigning for the Republican  
presidential nomination. But backers have been carefully building a 
campaign organization in the state where precinct caucuses launch 
the nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign has leased office space, hired a state campaign  
manager and communications director and begun to build a field 
operation. The office opens June 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's high-profile role in opening the campaign offices is  
yet another indication of the backing that Bush is getting from the 
GOP establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	While he has not formally endorsed a candidate, Thompson, who  
once considered making the race himself, has conceded Bush is 
likely to win the Republican nomination unless misfortune strikes 
his campaign.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole would be satisfied with the  
$200,000 annual salary paid to presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, the Republican  
presidential contender said the proposal to double the salary for 
future presidents was ``ill-advised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said $200,000 was ``fair and appropriate,'' given the  
``cost-free housing'' in the White House, free travel, the use of 
Camp David and ``perks'' like a bowling alley, movie theaters and 
putting greens as added compensation for the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The value of these benefits adds up to millions of dollar  
annually,'' Dole said in the letter. ``When all these benefits are 
taken into consideration, I believe the taxpaying public would join 
me in opposing a presidential pay raise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is debating whether to raise the president's salary for  
the first time in almost 30 years. 
</P>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tony Coelho, Al Gore's newly installed  
campaign general chairman, named the vice president's longtime 
adviser and aide Marla Romash as deputy chairman Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Romash has served as Gore's communications director during his  
first term as vice president and also when he was a U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Romash has a long history of media and campaign experience. She  
began working for fellow Connecticut native Christopher Dodd's 
first senatorial campaign and served as his press secretary in the 
early 1980s. She also worked for several years as a newspaper 
reporter and television news producer.

<HEADLINE> Women World Cup Soccer Selling Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Women's World Cup organizers have passed 400,000  
in ticket sales, well past their initial projections for the 
tournament that starts in less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	However, unlike the men's World Cup, the FIFA Women's World  
Championship, as it officially is called, is relying almost 
exclusively on fans from the United States, women's World Cup 
president and CEO Marla Messing said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 62,000 tickets have been sold for the  
tournament-opening doubleheader in East Rutherford, N.J., which 
matches the United States vs. Denmark and Brazil vs. Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Messing said the tournament is averaging more than 23,000  
tickets per doubleheader, including 16,000 for those not involving 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the men's World Cup, this year's event, which runs June  
19-July 10 in seven U.S. venues, all games except the semifinals 
are doubleheaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Messing said her staff initially projected ticket sales of  
386,000, but has since revised that to 475,000, and Messing 
personally feels that 500,000 is more than reachable. 
</P>
<P>
	In mid April, organizers had said they had sold 325,000 tickets.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our gut tells us that 95 percent (of ticket sales) are from  
the U.S.,'' said Messing. ``People are buying tickets because they 
want to be part of the World Cup experience.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate OKs US Exercizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- After weeks of emotional debate, the  
Philippine Senate approved an accord Thursday that will allow 
American troops to resume large-scale military exercises in the 
former U.S. colony. 
</P>
<P>
	The Visiting Forces Agreement garnered the support of 18 of the  
23 senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of activists, nuns and priests protested outside the  
Senate. Riot police and soldiers, some with tear gas canisters, 
formed a wall around the Senate building with their shields. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord, signed by Philippine and U.S. officials last year,  
will permit the United States to resume major ship visits and 
large-scale joint exercises which were suspended in 1996. Defense 
Secretary Orlando Mercado said he expects the first exercises to be 
held in about six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Military ties with the United States, which ruled the  
Philippines for nearly half a century, have remained a sensitive 
issue since the Senate forced the closure of the last U.S. base in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of Filipinos support the agreement, according to  
recent surveys, but the Catholic Church and left-wing groups have 
strongly opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the agreement would limit the Philippine  
government's right to prosecute American soldiers who commit crimes 
and would drag it into conflicts with enemies of the United States. 
The presence of U.S. troops would also encourage prostitution, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those backing the agreement argued the need to bolster  
the country's security because of disputes with China over 
territories in the South China Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	At the U.S. Embassy, about 200 young leftist activists hurled  
stones as they tried to storm the building, but riot police forced 
them back with truncheons and shields.

<HEADLINE> Campbell Soup Successor Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Campbell Soup Co. on Thursday named a former  
paper company executive as its chairman, replacing David W. 
Johnson, the leader credited with turning around the food company. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip E. Lippincott, the longest serving member on the  
company's board of directors, was elected chairman, effective, Aug. 
1. He succeeds Johnson, who is retiring July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Camden-based Campbell said Dale Morrison will remain as its  
president and chief executive officer, positions held by Johnson 
until 1997 when Johnson announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 66, a native Australian, came to Campbell as its CEO in  
1990 from Gerber Products Co. He was the first outsider to head 
Campbell in the 130-year history of the company. He became chairman 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	His first task was to quell dissension among members of the  
controlling Dorrance family, heirs to the inventor of condensed 
soup who were considering selling the company. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first year, Johnson led a major restructuring, closing  
plants and selling off businesses. Campbell shed 11,000 workers, 
including 800 at its Camden soup factory, which was eventually 
demolished. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure, Johnson led Campbell to a dramatic  
turnaround, focusing on improving sales and boosting stock prices 
and total investor return. Johnson owns company stock worth about 
$75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was scheduled to retire in July 1998 when his five-year  
contract expired, but the board of directors asked him to remain 
until the end of the 1999 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lippincott, 63, became chief executive officer of Scott Paper  
Co. in 1982 and its chairman a year later. He held both positions 
until 1994. Lippincott has been on Campbell's board of directors 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles R. Perrin, chairman and chief executive officer of Avon  
Products, Inc., was elected to fill Johnson's seat on the 16-member 
Campbell board. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell sells soup under its familiar red-and-white label and  
other varieties, Godiva chocolate, as well as vegetable juices, 
sauces and baked goods. It is the world's largest soup maker and 
the sixth-largest food company in the United States with 1998 
fiscal year sales of $6.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> Trainer Anoints Real Quiet Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The trainer of Real Quiet, the 4-5 favorite for  
Saturday's 60th running of the Grade II $600,000 Massachusetts 
Handicap at Suffolk Downs, arrived in Boston on Thursday and 
pronounced his horse fit and ready for the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thinking I can run him here and have him ready for the  
Hollywood Gold Cup,'' said Bob Baffert, referring to the $1 million 
Grade I Gold Cup, which will be run at Hollywood Park in California 
June 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet, winner of both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness  
Stakes in 1998, won the Pimlico Special in his last start by a 
half-length over Free House in a head-to-head duel over the last 
three-eighths of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first time Baffert has run a horse in the race.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've followed the history of the MassCap and I know from the  
past runnings that it will take a very good horse to win the 
race,'' Baffert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert sees National Thoroughbred Racing Association Champions  
Series points leader Behrens as his main competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at his numbers, he has run faster than Real Quiet,  
so we are really going to have to step it up to face him,'' Baffert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrens is coming off consecutive Grade I wins in the Gulfstream  
Park and Oaklawn handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the field for the 1 1/8-mile race, the fifth leg in the  
National Thoroughbred Racing Association Champions Series, are: 
Running Stag, Galloping Gael, Personal Moon and Brushing Up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running Stag is a very tough horse also and likes to come off  
the pace,'' Baffert said. ``He could easily make it a more 
competitive race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Running Stag finished second in his last race, the Shergar Cup  
Classic at 1 1/8 miles on the turf in England. He will be carrying 
eight pounds less than Real Quiet and five pounds less than 
Behrens. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloping Gael is the only Massachusetts bred horse ever to run  
in the race. He will be carrying the colors of owners David Ahearn 
and Jim Dubovick.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets rose Wednesday,  
shrugging off losses in the two largest regional markets and taking 
cue from overnight gains on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average  
slipped Thursday to shed 53.33 points, or 0.33 percent, closing at 
16,177.19. On Wednesday, the average gained 16.29 points, or 0.10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Many institutional investors held back to assess recent  
corporate earnings announcements, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar drifted higher against the  
Japanese yen on buying by Japanese institutional investors and 
overseas funds early in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.43 yen in the late afternoon, up 0.33 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level 
of 122.17 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen's recent strength sent Seoul's key index higher. The  
Kospi index closed up 1 percent, or 6.61 points, to 726.66. 
</P>
<P>
	A relatively strong yen is believed to be positive for the price  
competitiveness of South Korean companies, which directly compete 
with Japanese companies in roughly half of their exports. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, stocks ended lower on concerns over worsening  
U.S.-China ties offset gains by market heavyweight HSBC Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 0.8 percent, or 100.63  
points, to 12,308.53. It had gained 0.5 percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. congressional report released Tuesday said China has  
stolen U.S. nuclear and missile secrets over the past two decades, 
aggravating battered U.S.-China relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ng, dealing director at Sassoon Securities Ltd., said  
souring U.S.-China relations have clouded the prospect of China's 
quick entry to the World Trade Organization, which hurt 
China-related shares. 
</P>
<P>
	But Singapore shares and some smaller Asian markets rose on  
gains on Wall Street where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 
171.07 points, or 1.60 percent, on Wednesday to end at 10,702.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore's Straits Times Index closed 22.04 points, or 1.2  
percent, higher at 1915.77. Share prices were also supported by 
bargain-hunting after recent losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai shares rebounded despite some selling by investors  
cashing in on recent gains, dealers said. The SET index closed up 
6.07 points, or 1.3 percent, at 464.28. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Shares fell as investors cashed in on recent gains. The  
JSX Composite Index closed down 0.4 percent, or 2.671 points, at 
603.116 points. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Shares rose as local institutional investors  
scooped up blue chips. The benchmark Composite Index, closed up 
6.52 points, or 0.9 percent, at 760.34 points. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Shares ended higher, buoyed by Wall Street's gains and  
investors positioning on certain stocks ahead of Friday's release 
of first quarter economic data. The PSE Index rose 12.53 points, or 
0.5 percent, to 2,402.88. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares ended broadly weaker after nervous  
investors ignored a sharp rise on Wall Street and instead took 
their lead from a drop in the futures market and a rise in bond 
yields. The All Ordinaries index finished at 2,904.7, down 13.8 
points, or 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan shares ended moderately higher amid expectations  
of an improving economy and on gains on Wall Street. The Weighted 
Price Index closed up 42.38 points, or 0.6 percent, to 7,469.01.

<P>
	WELLINGTON: Shares finished higher, boosted by hefty gains by

<HEADLINE> Gov. Vetoes Execution Moratorium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Citing concerns about its  
constitutionality, Gov. Mike Johanns vetoed legislation that would 
have made Nebraska the first state to place a moratorium on 
executions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The death penalty is the law of Nebraska,'' the first-term  
governor said Wednesday. ``We have an obligation to enforce that 
law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill called for a two-year moratorium on executions while a  
study was done to see if the death penalty is being applied fairly. 
Death sentences could have been issued during the moratorium, but 
no executions would have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns, a Republican who supports capital punishment, said he  
received more than 250 letters, e-mails and calls on the matter, 
including a call from Pope John Paul II's representative in 
Washington D.C., urging him to sign the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns said he did not let politics or religion play a role in  
his decision. The GOP platform supports the death penalty while the 
Catholic Church opposes capital punishment. Johanns is a devout 
Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears unlikely that lawmakers have enough votes to override  
the veto. The measure passed Nebraska's one-house Legislature last 
week on a 27-21 vote. Thirty votes are needed for an override. 
</P>
<P>
	The moratorium was proposed by Omaha Sen. Kermit Brashear, a  
death penalty supporter and former Republican candidate for 
governor. He presented the measure as an amendment to state Sen. 
Ernie Chambers' bill to abolish the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers, an independent, fumed over Johanns' decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``I see the governor as a perfidious individual. He decided to  
toy with the wrong man,'' Chambers said. ``He'll have a chance to 
see what my intentions are in the coming sessions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, state Attorney General Don Stenberg said a  
moratorium on executions approved by lawmakers would violate the 
state constitution and ``usurp powers granted ... to the executive 
branch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three men have been put to death since Nebraska resumed  
executions in 1994 after a 35-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states have considered moratoriums but have not adopted  
legislation, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a 
Washington-based group critical of how capital punishment is 
applied. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida officials stopped executions for a year after a fire  
started during a 1997 electrocution. The Illinois House recently 
passed a resolution urging the governor to impose a six-month 
moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bar Association and the National Conference of  
Catholic Bishops also have called for such moratoriums.

<HEADLINE> IRA Conversion Cutoff Is Oct. 15 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taxpayers who discovered they are not eligible  
to convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA but missed the April 15 
deadline for switching back got a six-month extension Wednesday 
from the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on research into its own regulations regarding automatic  
extensions, the IRS determined these taxpayers should have until 
Oct. 15 to switch the Roth individual retirement arrangement back 
to a traditional IRA, preserving their full tax advantages for 1998 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem came up when some taxpayers had converted to the  
Roth IRA in calendar 1998, then discovered their adjusted gross 
incomes topped the $100,000 limit to make the change or that they 
were ineligible because they were married but filed separate tax 
returns. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Backs Old-Style Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is  
injecting himself into the 2000 presidential campaign, suggesting 
that the Lincoln-Douglas debates of the mid-19th century are a 
better model for sorting out candidates than the 
made-for-television soundbites of today. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to be sent to senior GOP leaders, Gingrich suggests  
a series of encounters in which each contender is allowed to 
present a 15-minute speech on a prearranged topic, and then answers 
questions for five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This approach would establish an adult rhythm of responsible  
people describing important ideas in a serious way,'' Gingrich 
wrote to Republican Chairman Jim Nicholson, all 50 state GOP chairs 
and all Republican members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas held a series of three-hour  
debates in their campaign for an Illinois Senate election in 1858. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously the modern age would not afford that kind of  
opportunity to nine or 10 different candidates,'' Gingrich wrote. 
``On the other hand, there is nothing which requires us to reduce 
the presidency to an average soundbite of nine seconds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, who had been exploring a run for the White House,  
served four years as speaker. He left Congress at the end of last 
term after Republicans unexpectedly lost seats in the elections. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	The House Republican leadership is moving to counter an effort  
to force campaign finance legislation to the floor this summer, and 
hoping to reassure GOP supporters of the bill that leaders will 
follow through on a promised debate in September. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same day that six Republicans broke ranks and signed a  
petition to force the measure to the floor as quickly as possible, 
one committee announced plans to conduct public hearings on the 
issue in June and July. 
</P>
<P>
	And House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., reaffirmed his  
intention to bring the measure to the floor in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the speaker feels very comfortable with the  
schedule,'' said his spokesman, John Feehery. ``It's disappointing 
that they decided to sign this discharge petition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some prominent GOP supporters of campaign finance legislation  
withheld their signatures during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``For now, I'm uncommitted,'' said Rep. Zach Wamp of Tennessee,  
who has battled his party's leadership on the issue in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey said, ``Conditions were very  
different when Gingrich was here. There was no alternative and he 
was absolutely adamant'' about his opposition to bringing the issue 
to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	It takes 218 names on a petition to force legislation to the  
floor. Thus far there are 201, including 196 Democrats and the five 
Republicans who signed Wednesday. They are Reps. Chris Shays of 
Connecticut; Mike Castle of Delaware; Michael Forbes of New York; 
Greg Ganske of Iowa; Connie Morella of Maryland and Nancy Johnson 
of Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to act on campaign finance reform now, not tomorrow,''  
Shays said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, 16 Democrats have withheld their names. Party  
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they expect a 
few to sign the petition, thereby increasing pressure on the 
Republicans who have called for an early vote but don't want to 
buck their own party's leadership.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Secretary Fingered in IBM Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Twenty-five people pocketed more than $1.3  
million from insider trading, a scheme that began not with a Wall 
Street wizard but an IBM secretary familiar with company expansion 
plans, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission said the illegal trades --  
many by novices to the securities markets who did not even have 
accounts -- were touched off when Lorraine K. Cassano told her 
husband that International Business Machines Corp. was about to 
acquire Lotus Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	When the 1995 deal was announced, Lotus stock jumped nearly 90  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those charged was a pizzeria owner, a bank vice president,  
a private school teacher, a grocery store owner, a lawyer, the 
president of a direct-mail marketing company, a doctor, an engineer 
and several stockbrokers. Of those charged, 13 live in New York, 
and six in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen a shift away from the Wall Street kingpins to Main  
Street America,'' SEC enforcement director Richard Walker said as 
the government watchdog of the securities industry announced one of 
its biggest cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In papers filed in federal court in New York, the SEC said Mrs.  
Cassano told her husband, Robert M. Cassano, a paging 
communications company salesman, who then told two friends who 
agreed to purchase stock for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Those two friends told others and soon the information had  
spread to family members, friends and stock brokers, the SEC said 
in the civil action. 
</P>
<P>
	The illegal trading happened during a 6 1/2-hour period on June 2,  
1995, the SEC said. Three days later, IBM announced its takeover 
offer for Lotus and the value of Lotus stock leaped from $32.50 per 
share to more than $61. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cassano, a secretary in the Volumes and Revenue Department  
of the Software Group at IBM in Somers, N.Y., was suspended then 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said Mrs. Cassano first learned of the pending Lotus  
deal when she was asked to copy documents in late April or early 
May 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said Robert Cassano pleaded guilty to insider trading in  
1998. At least six others have pleaded guilty in the case so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC is asking the court to order the defendants to return  
their ill-gotten gains and pay a fine equal to three times the 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cassanos could not immediately be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE> IBM Exec Claims Microsoft Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- During one of the lowest points of the  
soured relationship between two of the computer industry's giants, 
Microsoft offered an alliance with IBM if it agreed to sacrifice 
its rival operating-system software, an IBM manager told lawyers 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that in a meeting during a trade show in Las Vegas with  
top Microsoft executives -- including Bill Gates -- IBM rejected the 
overture and said it planned to sell both Windows and its own OS/2 
operating system, which ultimately proved a commercial failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Garry Norris, the IBM manager who will be one of the  
government's final witnesses in its antitrust trial with Microsoft, 
contended in sworn testimony Thursday that Microsoft exerted 
pressure on IBM to cut its sales of OS/2, the software product that 
competed directly with Windows until the popularity of OS/2 waned 
in late 1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He also testified that major computer makers, such as Compaq  
Computer Corp., agreed not to sell OS/2 on their machines because 
of threats from Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said a Compaq executive told him Microsoft had promised  
in 1993 ``to make it difficult for Compaq'' if it sold IBM's 
product, and he revealed that IBM complained about the alleged 
threats to the Justice Department as early as 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, who works for IBM at nearby Research Triangle Park, will  
be the government's second witness during the rebuttal phase of the 
trial, which resumes Tuesday in Washington after a 13-week recess. 
A Microsoft lawyer, Rick Pepperman, questioned Norris in North 
Carolina about his expected testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said that after IBM rejected Microsoft's alleged offer in  
1994, Microsoft took an unusually tough stance negotiating the 
wholesale price that IBM paid to put Windows on computers it sold 
to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said that weeks before the August 1995 rollout of an  
important new version of Windows, Microsoft threatened to end 
negotiations, which were at a standstill. The companies finally 
reached an agreed price, ``15 minutes before the launch of Windows 
95,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM had paid only $9 for earlier versions of Windows, what it  
believed to be the lowest price paid by any company. But Microsoft 
wanted about $46 for Windows 95 -- much more than IBM believed some 
other computer makers were paying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft told us repeatedly, `Because you compete with us,  
you're going to get unfavorable terms and conditions,''' Norris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said IBM's costs rose from $40 million to $220 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Although the exact price that Microsoft charges for Windows is  
one of the industry's most closely guarded secrets, previous 
testimony indicated that favored companies, such as Compaq Computer 
Corp., generally pay less than IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told they (Compaq) received that deduction because they  
didn't compete with Microsoft,'' Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends that Compaq received lower prices because it  
qualified for some volume discounts and because Compaq helped 
develop some important technology that was incorporated into 
Windows 95. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its antitrust case, the government alleges that  
Microsoft bullies the nation's computer manufacturers. Lawyers say 
it uses prices to punish its enemies and reward its friends, and to 
stem potential competition among operating system software, 
Microsoft's most lucrative franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers indicate Norris will testify at the trial about the  
threats Microsoft allegedly made over IBM's support of OS/2 and 
Internet browser software from Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris' deposition was the second of three scheduled this week.  
The government will depose a Microsoft witness, software executive 
Gordon Eubanks, on Friday in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters are allowed to attend the depositions under a 1913 law  
covering antitrust depositions, which are normally conducted in 
private.

<HEADLINE>  India, Pakistan Tensions Escalate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- Two Indian fighter jets went down in Pakistan  
today as India launched a second day of rocket attacks in Kashmir 
to dislodge Pakistan-backed guerrillas from the disputed frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan said it shot down the jets, but Indian officials said  
one crashed due to mechanical failure and the other was shot down 
when it tried to rescue the first pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	The downing of the planes and the use of Indian air power  
indicated a major escalation in the battle over Kashmir, a 
Himalayan territory divided between India and Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bitter rivals, India and Pakistan have fought two of their three  
wars over the Himalayan state and continue to skirmish daily along 
the ``line of control'' that divides Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased tensions between the world's two newest nuclear  
powers alarmed world leaders and brought calls for concern from the 
United Nations, the United States and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	India said it had aimed rockets today and Wednesday at Pakistani  
soldiers and guerrillas entrenched in rugged, snowcapped mountains 
in the Indian-held part of Kashmir. Pakistan, however, denied that 
its troops were involved and said India's aircraft had bombed 
Pakistani territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pakistan army said today it shot down an Indian MiG-27 and a  
MiG-21 fighter jet. One pilot survived and was arrested and another 
died, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The planes were well inside Pakistan territory,'' said Army  
spokesman Brig. Rashid Quereshi. ``We already had given India a 
warning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	India acknowledged that two planes were down. One jet had  
mechanical failure and the pilot had to eject in hostile terrain, 
said Air Vice Marshal A.K. Mullick, a defense spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	A second jet was shot down when it went to rescue the downed  
pilot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's Information Minister called for immediate U.N.  
intervention and said the downing of the aircraft was 
``vindication'' of Indian territorial aggression. He urged India to 
open negotiations with Pakistan and called on U.N. chief Kofi Annan 
to immediately send a special envoy to the region. 
</P>
<P>
	A 465-mile ``line of control'' -- established after the last war  
in 1971 -- divides Kashmir between the two countries. Muslim 
guerrillas have been fighting with Indian security forces in 
Kashmir since 1989, a conflict that has killed more than 15,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Kashmir is the only Muslim-dominated region in largely Hindu  
India. Pakistan, an Islamic republic, says Kashmiris should have 
the right to self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Indian soldiers fire frequently to thwart Muslim  
guerrillas from trying to sneak into India, this time satellite 
photos reportedly showed that 600 guerrillas had pushed nearly four 
miles into India, in areas uninhabited by the army, officials said. 
Intelligence agencies said the rebels possess antiaircraft 
missiles, radar, snowmobiles and sophisticated communications 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said Pakistan knew  
nothing about the infiltrators. ``No one knows where they come from 
and who they are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan continued to fire mortar shells into Indian-held areas  
of Kashmir today, even after Indian air force jets attacked the 
intruders Wednesday, said Indian Maj. Gen. J.J. Singh. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Indian air strikes have been very effective,'' Singh told  
a news conference in New Delhi. ``In most cases, the intruders have 
been isolated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This afternoon, a few Pakistani shells fell on a deserted  
mountainside overlooking Kargil, a town in a fertile valley a few 
miles from the disputed frontier. An Indian artillery battery, 
hunkered behind a ridge high up in the hills, immediately fired 
back nine 105mm shells at the Pakistani village of Olghing Thong. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Commodore Subash Bhojwani, air officer for operations, would  
not say how long the airstrikes would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not possible to lay down the time frame. This is war,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Singh said the attacks Wednesday and today resulted in ``heavy  
casualties'' among the intruders -- mainly Afghans and Pakistani 
soldiers -- with many of them killed and wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pakistani army claimed today that Indian troops suffered  
heavy casualties and were repulsed when they attacked Pakistani 
military outposts on the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan, as well as the United States and Britain, called on all  
parties to stop the fighting, fearing that Kashmir could become a 
nuclear flashpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	A regional Indian military official said the dispute was an  
internal Indian matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a warlike situation at all. It's a local  
problem,'' said V.S Budhwan, an army corps commander at Kargil, a 
town a few miles from the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian officials said Wednesday that at least 160 Afghan  
guerrillas and Pakistani soldiers have been killed since the two 
countries exchanged mortar and artillery fire over the last two 
weeks. Thousands of residents have fled the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian aircraft began attacking rebel positions in the  
17,000-foot peaks at dawn Wednesday. Later, MiG jets and MI-25 
helicopters roared over Dras, a village a mile from the border 
between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dras, 100 miles northeast of state capital, Srinagar, Indian  
army officers said 70 infiltrators had entrenched themselves on the 
slopes of the mountains at one spot Wednesday, looking down at 
Indian army convoys 2,700 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
	Army officers in the area said the infiltrators must have taken  
months to occupy the posts. Indian opposition parties criticized 
the army failure to spot them earlier.

<HEADLINE> Funding for Discount Internet OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schools and libraries will share $2.25 billion  
for Internet hookups and other communications services under a 
federal decision Thursday to approve the maximum funding allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission approved the amount, an  
increase of nearly $1 billion from current levels, despite concerns 
that it would cause higher telephone charges. The money is 
collected from phone companies, which usually pass on the fees to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three commissioners supported the maximum level, and two  
opposed. Commissioner Michael Powell said he would have supported a 
lower amount, but not $2.25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The funding will help wire 528,000 poorer or rural classrooms to  
the Internet, benefiting some 40 million kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``Success in the next millennium will be more and more dependent  
on access to information,'' said Bob Chase, president of the 
National Education Association. ``Now, all Americans, regardless of 
age, income level or geographic location, will have the opportunity 
to learn anything in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard Riley called the commission's action  
``a very significant step toward preparing America's students for 
the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, under its rules, is allowed to set aside up to  
$2.25 billion a year for the education-rate program, or E-rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics fear the full funding will lead to higher phone bills.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every billion dollars of direct fees is $10 per household, per  
year in America,'' said Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the 
other dissenter on the funding level. 
</P>
<P>
	His calculations translate to $22.50 per household each year.  
But the chief of the commission's Common Carrier Bureau, Larry 
Strickling, offered a cost of about $4 a year per phone line. He 
said the program gets some of its costs from wireless subscribers, 
who were not included in the staff calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents say the increase will be offset by some $1 billion  
worth of savings expected later this year in certain long-distance 
telephone fees. Those reductions, however, have come into question 
since a federal appeals court ruled last week that there was 
inadequate explanation for the way the fees were calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to criticisms about cost, FCC Chairman Bill Kennard  
said, ``We can't afford to leave poor kids in America in the dark 
ages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission last year scaled back the program's budget after  
consumer groups and some lawmakers called for cuts or halts in 
funding. Instead, the commission authorized $1.93 billion for the 
program's first 18 months, a rate of about $1.3 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 32,000 applications already have been filed for the  
program's second full fiscal year, which begins July 1. Demand is 
estimated to total $2.44 billion -- more than the $2.25 billion 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said the program should be able to fund all  
requests for Internet access and telecommunications services such 
as telephones and satellites. Money would be left to fill only some 
of the requests for internal wiring.

<HEADLINE> McCain Discusses Education, Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, a Republican presidential  
candidate who jump-started his campaign with a hawkish stance on 
Kosovo, broadened his political agenda Thursday with campaign 
initiatives on Social Security, education and tax reform. 
</P>
<P>
	In a commencement address to Johns Hopkins University graduates,  
McCain challenged Republicans and Democrats alike to dramatically 
change their approach to domestic policy debates and end ``this 
sickness in American political life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is we who have squandered the public trust. We, who have --  
time and again, in full public view -- placed our personal or 
partisan interests before the national interest, earning the 
public's contempt with our poll-driven policies, our phony 
posturing, the lies we call spin, and the damage control we 
substitute for progress,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a three-term senator from Arizona, trails Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush and former American Red Cross president Elizabeth 
Dole in GOP polling but has emerged as a solid alternative should 
the early front-runners falter. 
</P>
<P>
	His poll ratings inched upward nationally, doubling in New  
Hampshire, as he conducted hundreds of television and newspaper 
interviews to criticize President Clinton's handling of Kosovo. The 
former Vietnam prisoner of war was the first presidential hopeful 
to say the United States must win at all cost, even if that means 
using grounds troops. 
</P>
<P>
	A self-styled political maverick, McCain has bucked his party  
leadership by proposing tax increases on tobacco and sweeping 
campaign finance reforms. Both initiatives failed. 
</P>
<P>
	With the campaign finance reform debate stirring anew in  
Congress, McCain said Thursday that the impasse won't end until 
politicians in both parties act ``with courage to break with the 
corrupting practices of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats must wean themselves from large, unregulated donations  
by labor unions, he said. As for his own party: ``Republicans will 
have to risk their financial superiority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is not a new formulation for the Arizona senator, but  
McCain expanded his attack-all-sides technique to outline new 
initiatives that he hopes will move his campaign beyond Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rank-and-file Republican voters don't really know him. A lot  
do, but those who don't are just getting to know him with Kosovo,'' 
said Republican consultant Charlie Black, a Bush ally. ``He 
certainly needs to fill out his agenda for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio said his surveys show that 51  
percent of GOP voters approve of McCain's position on Kosovo. 
``While a majority, it isn't overwhelming and isn't enough to get 
you elected,'' the pollster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign policy still ranks last on a list of issues important to  
GOP voters, with only 11 percent choosing the topic over three 
topics that tied for the lead: the economy, morality and social 
issues, Fabrizio said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care,'' McCain said in an interview before his  
address. ``If the polls showed 1 percent approved of my position, 
it wouldn't change my mind about what's right for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senator is taking care not to become a single-issue  
candidate. His speech Thursday was designed to produce a slim 
outline of his non-Kosovo agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans a series of speeches detailing his plans for Social  
Security, campaign finances, education and taxes, beginning next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	With his first step Thursday, he urged Republicans to resist  
using Social Security revenues to balance the budget and demanded 
that Democrats ``stop using the issue to scare the elderly into 
voting against Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized both parties in Congress for passing an emergency  
Kosovo bill that he said pays for nine ``pork barrel projects for 
every legitimate emergency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed forbidding the use of Social Security revenues on  
anything other than Social Security benefits. Under his plan, 
Americans would be allowed to invest part of their payroll taxes in 
private accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said 60 percent of the federal budget surplus should be  
used to bolster Social Security, with the rest going to tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he also would close special interest loopholes and  
subsidies to help pay for his tax-cut plan, which would lower the 
tax rate from 28 percent to 15 percent for people earning less than 
$35,000 or couples earning less than $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He also would end the tax penalty for married people, eliminate  
the policy that reduces Social Security benefits for elderly people 
who are still working; and reduce the inheritance tax. 
</P>
<P>
	On education, McCain said Republicans should recognize the  
``urgent necessity'' to raise teacher pay. Democrats, he said, must 
learn to accept ``teacher testing and merit pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good teachers should be rewarded and bad teachers should be  
encourage to ``do something else for a living,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Leafs Meet Sabres Tonight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Now it's up to the Dominator.  
</P>
<P>
	After sitting out the the first two games of the Eastern  
Conference finals against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Buffalo Sabres 
goaltender Dominik Hasek has been given the go-ahead to return to 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek expected to make the big decision sometime before Game 3  
tonight at Marine Midland Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's medically cleared to play,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff  
said Wednesday. ``He's just got to get through that move whether he 
can get in the butterfly position and go up and down easy enough to 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After giving up 10 goals in splitting the first two games in  
Toronto, the Sabres were more than ready to see their star goalie 
back on the ice. The Sabres were a dispirited team after losing 6-3 
in Game 2 on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, who has been out with a groin injury while Dwayne Roloson  
played in his place, skated for a half-hour on Wednesday and said 
he liked how he was progressing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't stop too many pucks, but I felt very good,'' said  
Hasek, who has won the last two Hart trophies as league MVP. ``I 
didn't do everything, but my skating was almost without pain. I 
feel closer to playing the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know with this injury I won't be 100 percent. But I've  
already played with the injury and I wasn't 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Hasek decides on further rest, Ruff said Roloson would  
probably start for the third straight time, but he also said minor 
leaguer Martin Biron could see action if Roloson falters. Biron 
played Wednesday night in the AHL playoffs at Rochester and beat 
Philadelphia 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buffalo offense also was set for a boost. The Sabres'  
leading scorer, Miroslav Satan, said he was ready to return, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors told me I have to go through some pain, and a little  
bit is still there, but it's nothing I can't handle,'' said Satan, 
who suffered an injury to his right foot in the opening round of 
the playoffs against Ottawa and hasn't played since. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres certainly need any kind of edge. So do the Maplel  
Leafs, at least according to coach Pat Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to try to get better,'' Quinn said. ``If we don't, we  
won't survive this series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Quinn's protestations, the Maple Leafs did OK in Game 2,  
jumping to an early 2-0 lead and throwing plenty of doubt into the 
seldom-used Roloson and his teammates. The six Toronto goals were 
the most the Sabres have allowed in the playoffs, and the only ones 
Buffalo got against goalie Curtis Joseph came on the vaunted power 
play. The Sabres have scored at least one power-play goal in each 
of their 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew they were going to come out hard, and they did,'' said  
Sabres center Curtis Brown, who leads the team with five playoff 
goals. ``But it's not about who wins the first game or the second 
game. It's the first team to get to four.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what the coaches say, the absence of Hasek has had an  
effect on this series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always hard to play against Buffalo because of Hasek,''  
said Maple Leafs defenseman Dimitri Yushkevich. ``We make like 50 
shots and he always stops them all. It's hard to score on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Hasek plays but doesn't return to his dominant form -- he  
leads all playoff goalies with a .942 save percentage -- the Sabres 
will be hard-pressed to advance to the Stanley Cup finals for only 
the second time in team history. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting Hasek back might be just what the Sabres need to revert  
to their tight-checking brand of play. Without Hasek to confront, 
the Maple Leafs, who led the NHL in scoring during the regular 
season, have scored nine goals against Roloson and one 
empty-netter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just looking to get back to our game,'' said Sabres  
defenseman Jay McKee, who is a solid plus-7 in the playoffs. 
``We're not happy with that last one. I don't know if Toronto has 
gotten us off our game or if it's just us, but it's too 
run-and-gun.''

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Farmer Union Vote Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALINAS, Calif. (AP) -- The United Farm Workers, stung by losing  
a pivotal vote to represent strawberry workers, accused an 
inexperienced rival organization of coercion in winning over the 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers for Coastal Berry, the nation's largest strawberry  
grower, voted Tuesday and Wednesday in favor of representation by 
the upstart Coastal Berry of California Farm Worker Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	UFW president Arturo Rodriguez blamed interference by antiunion  
growers who feared a victory at Coastal Berry might spread to other 
berry fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their organization has nothing to offer, while we have  
demonstrated and proven results,'' he said. ``Clearly there was 
intimidation and coercion here, and we're going to continue our 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the results are not official and the UFW can still  
force a runoff, the election this week was widely seen as another 
sign of the union's failure to regain the clout it once had under 
Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	``The UFW made a lot of mistakes here,'' said John Borrego,  
associate professor of community studies at University of 
California, Santa Cruz, who follows the agricultural labor 
movement. ``This should send them the message that they have to 
change their strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State labor officials have yet to finalize the 646-577 vote.  
About 60 ballots are in dispute, and another 79 workers voted for a 
third option of no union, meaning that neither the UFW nor the 
novice committee has obtained the majority support necessary for 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW cannot win, said the state Agricultural Labor Relations  
Board, though it still could force a runoff if the Farm Worker 
Committee does not receive enough of the remaining votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Chavez, 80,000 farm workers were working under UFW  
contracts by 1970. Union membership had dwindled to 20,000 at the 
time of his death in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the UFW tried to kindle a resurgence in the state's  
$600 million, 20,000 worker strawberry industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But outside observers said the UFW made mistakes, including  
replacing about 10 local organizers with out-of-town professionals, 
and underestimating the tight relationship pickers had with 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were tremendous accusations when the UFW started  
organizing here that they were acting like bullies and they were 
telling these fiercely independent people that they should turn to 
them for support and give them part of their paycheck,'' said 
Borrego. ``This generation of workers hasn't even heard of Cesar 
Chavez. They don't bring with them a history that unions are 
wonderful things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result came as no surprise to Jess Brown, executive director  
of the Santa Cruz County Farm Bureau. He said the worker's choice 
is a sign of the UFW's weakness in the community. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union wasn't able to clearly show that it could do more  
than what the workers presently have or could have,'' he said. 
``The UFW didn't do their research. They thought this was something 
they could easily attain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Harley Shaiken, an industrial relations professor at  
UC-Berkeley, said the close vote suggests the UFW remains a force 
to be reckoned with in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be easy to say they had the election, the UFW lost,  
end of story. But it's more interesting that under circumstances 
that have been very difficult, the union has come very close to 
victory at a pivotal company,'' Shaiken said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Berry Co. President Ernie Farley, who has repeatedly  
asserted his neutrality, said his company will ``abide by whatever 
representing body the state labor board certifies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Jim Gumberg, who represents the Coastal Berry of  
California Farm Worker Committee, said his group has no president 
and is led by a vice president -- Sergio Leal -- who was fired by 
Coastal Berry for alleged misconduct. He said he isn't sure whether 
they have obtained Labor Department recognition as a union, and he 
said none of them has negotiated a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Workers weren't voting for our agenda here,'' he said. ``They  
were voting against the UFW with its slick organizers who threaten, 
cajole, intimidate, and have never picked a berry in their lives.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Open Hearings On NYPD Tactics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal commission waded into the tense and  
politically charged debate over police tactics, hearing hours of 
testimony from critics, defenders and purported victims of the New 
York Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir  
defended the department Wednesday against a parade of witnesses who 
said the city's falling crime rate has come at the price of 
citizens' civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Al Sharpton, who led protests against the February  
police killing of West African immigrant Amadou Diallo, said 
Giuliani and Safir have helped set a tone of disdain for minorities 
that encourages abuse and harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something told (former Officer) Justin Volpe that he could get  
away'' with sodomizing Haitian immigrant Abner Louima, Sharpton 
said, referring to the officer who pleaded guilty this week in one 
of the city's most notorious brutality cases. ``That's frightening, 
and we should have (federal) civil rights monitors in the 
precincts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three other officers are still on trial for allegedly beating  
Louima and a fourth, a police sergeant, is charged with covering up 
the 1997 incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-member U.S. Civil Rights Commission has the power to  
issue recommendations or appoint an independent federal monitor to 
take over the NYPD if it finds a pervasive pattern of violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Giuliani's and Safir's testimonies were punctuated with  
hisses and murmurs of ``liar, liar'' from some spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's not confuse crime-fighting with brutality,'' Sharpton  
said. ``If you're a criminal with blue jeans on or a blue uniform, 
we want you in jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, police were trying to determine whether an officer  
fired at a black teen-ager in the Bronx early Wednesday or whether 
his gun went off accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
	Dante Johnson, 16, was critically injured after he ran from  
officers who believed he and another teen might have been armed, 
police said. The boy was struggling with Officer Mark Conway when 
he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's family said he was unarmed and returning home after  
playing basketball.

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs More Airport Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Transportation Committee has  
approved a large increase in airport spending, with its Republican 
leader saying that improving airport safety and facilities is worth 
taking a bite out of the GOP's tax cut plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, on a voice vote Thursday, endorsed a plan to increase  
the Federal Aviation Administration budget from $9.7 billion this 
year to $15.4 billion in 2004. The total increase from current 
spending plans over the five-year period would be $14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., a powerful advocate of  
airport and highway programs, said the increase could be paid for 
by reducing the GOP's planned 10-year $778 billion general tax cut 
by $14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bill, which should reach the House floor in mid-June,  
faces opposition from fiscal conservatives, the administration and 
the Appropriations Committee which is responsible for drawing up 
annual federal budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would enact one of Shuster's prime goals, separating  
from the general budget the Aviation Trust Fund, which holds 
revenues from airport user taxes, and using those taxes exclusively 
for airport improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently those revenues go into the general budget, and since  
more money comes in than is spent on airport projects, the balance, 
now $10 billion and expected to rise to $91 billion by 2009, lifts 
the overall budget surplus that Republicans hope to turn into a tax 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is wrong to use aviation taxes to finance a general tax  
cut,'' Shuster and the committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. James 
Oberstar of Minnesota, wrote in a letter to other House members. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster and Oberstar, who last year were successful in moving a  
similar highway trust fund off-budget, said all the increased 
spending would come from unused aviation trust fund money and that 
it was ``absolutely false'' that other federal programs would have 
to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	But isolating the trust fund from the general budget is strongly  
resisted by appropriators, who guard their control over the annual 
budget process. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Department Secretary Rodney Slater, in a letter  
to Shuster, also said that putting up a ``firewall'' around 
aviation taxes ``would provide the FAA with a guaranteed funding 
stream without providing incentives to use those funds 
efficiently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slater said that while he supported many of the objectives of  
the bill, ``I would be unable to recommend that the president 
sign'' it in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's proposal modified an FAA bill the committee approved  
in March that would have doubled aviation spending over five years. 
That proved too much for the GOP leadership, which is already 
struggling to abide by budget spending caps while living up to its 
promise for an across-the-board tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would increase the FAA's facilities budget by 50  
percent, take steps to increase service and competition at small 
airports and provide more money for new runways and air traffic 
controllers.

<HEADLINE> Details Given in School Killing Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- Four middle school students plotted to  
force their principal at gunpoint to call an assembly, then 
massacre those at the gathering, several classmates testified 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The four then planned to kill themselves, one student said  
during a preliminary court hearing for two of the accused students. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing produced some of the first details of the alleged  
massacre plan since the boys were charged on May 13 -- just over 
three weeks after 15 people died at Columbine High School in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was held to determine whether there is enough  
evidence for the 14-year-old boys, Justin Schnepp and Jedaiah 
Zinzo, who is called David, to stand trial as adults on charges of 
conspiracy to commit murder. The maximum sentence is life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar examination is scheduled for June 1 for the two other  
accused boys, Jonathan McDonald and Daniel Fick, both 13. They are 
being prosecuted as adults in juvenile court. If convicted, they 
could be sentenced to juvenile detention or sentenced as adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnepp's attorney, Frederick Lepley, said the case should be  
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big difference between talking about something in  
class to impress your friends and carrying that out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors presented eight witnesses -- seven classmates and a  
police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	One student, Ryan Ranshaw, 14, said the boys sought his help in  
planning the massacre as they sat in the back of English class in 
Holland Woods Middle School on May 10. He said he declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``Justin said they were going to shoot up the school,'' he said.  
``They were going to go to the office, call an assembly, then go to 
the gym and shoot people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another student, Dana Thomas, 12, testified that she and  
Schnepp, McDonald and Fick were playing under a bridge on May 10 
when Fick told her the four were plotting an attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan started a conversation about a Colorado repeat,'' she  
said. ``He said he, Jon and David were going to shoot up the 
school, then commit suicide,'' Dana said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge did not immediately rule on whether the boys should be  
tried. He gave attorneys for both sides until June 11 to submit 
briefs.

<HEADLINE> Board of Trade Sets Eurex Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Board of Trade set June 24 as the  
date its membership will vote on a broad alliance with a 
fast-growing all-electronic exchange and announced other measures 
Thursday in an attempt to fend off competition that has challenged 
its dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	Those measures include slashing fees for large customers who  
want to trade electronically and lobbying federal regulators to 
relax restrictions the CBOT contends hampers growth of U.S. 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves highlight a startling about-face for the world's  
largest futures exchange, which is in danger of losing that title 
this year to the Frankfurt-based Eurex electronic exchange. In 
January it chose a go-slow approach by sticking with the 
auction-style trading, known as open outcry, that many call an 
anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, exchange Chairman David P. Brennan called Eurex  
``the best business alternative'' and urged members to accept the 
alliance, which insiders say is virtually identical to the one they 
rejected nearly six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago exchange has not revealed details of the pairing,  
but news reports have indicated it involves giving up its 
electronic trading platform, known as Project A, in favor of 
Eurex's electronic platform and cross-trading each other's 
contracts over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Project A platform was a key sticking point in the previous  
failed alliance bid. Smaller traders, called locals, also have been 
reluctant to cede authority to outsiders and abandon a 150-year 
tradition, which could possibly lead to job losses. That 
intransigence has killed merger hopes with rival Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange several times. 
</P>
<P>
	But large trading firms appear to be gaining the upper hand in a  
power struggle at the Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Board members recently backed exchange President Thomas Donovan,  
an advocate of speedier change, after Brennan sought to have him 
removed. And the Board of Trade Clearing Corp. voted Wednesday to 
change the way its directors are elected, giving larger firms more 
power in decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
	Such large trading firms have migrated to computer-based  
trading, saying it is easier and cheaper because it saves keeping 
expensive staff at individual exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our members and customers told us what they want, and the  
board acted quickly and decisively to keep their business,'' 
Donovan said Thursday of the board's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the industry say U.S. exchanges must adopt electronic  
trading amid stiff competition from overseas exchanges and 
over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Exchanges in London and Paris clung to open outcry, only to find  
much of their business stolen away by Eurex. They now have been 
forced to cut jobs and seek alliances with Eurex to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Former exchange Chairman Patrick Arbor, who narrowly lost a  
re-election bid in December, had argued the Board of Trade must be 
prepared to end the open outcry system if it wanted to save many of 
the Chicago area's 150,000 futures industry jobs.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- To be truly Catholic, what should colleges do?  
Keep crucifixes on classroom walls? Require religion courses? Spurn 
gay student organizations? Hire only theology professors who back 
the church's ban on women priests? 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond such specific disputes, there's a far broader debate in  
progress concerning the nation's 235 Catholic colleges and 
universities, which enroll 670,000 students. Many leaders in higher 
education have been engaged in a protracted struggle with Pope John 
Paul II's Vatican over how Catholic loyalty is defined and who 
defines it. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict originated in 1967 when a conference of U.S. campus  
administrators declared that ``the Catholic university must have a 
true autonomy and academic freedom in the face of authority of 
whatever kind, lay or clerical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the decades since, many U.S. Catholic campuses have  
secularized, becoming less distinguishable from other schools. For 
instance, a recent survey of a dozen church-related schools showed 
that only 57 percent of teachers were Catholic. And Rome has been 
upset by continual criticisms of church teachings from professors 
on U.S. Catholic campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	To strengthen the Catholic commitment of campuses worldwide, the  
pope issued a 1990 decree, ``Ex Corde Ecclesiae.'' It recognized 
universities' institutional autonomy and academic freedom, but only 
``within the confines of the truth and the common good.'' Rome 
directed the bishops in each nation to write policy statements 
applying the pope's rules. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the U.S. bishops endorsed a policy that was pretty much  
what colleges wanted. But the Vatican's education congregation 
bounced the document, directing the Americans to do a rewrite with 
more teeth. The U.S. bishops are now considering a second version 
fashioned to Rome's specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	The rewrite specifies, among other things, that a majority of  
board members and teachers should be Catholic if possible, that 
college presidents must take a prescribed oath of church fidelity 
and that anyone appointed to teach Catholic theology needs a 
``mandate,'' or endorsement, from the hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
	The text also says theology teachers are responsible for  
presenting ``authentic'' doctrine and that church authorities would 
have the power to withdraw their endorsement in case of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. hierarchy's committee on these issues meets June 28-9  
to consider proposed changes and plans to have a third version 
ready for action when all the American bishops meet in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee chairman, Bishop John Leibrecht of Springfield,  
Mo., explains: ``We're looking for a way, agreed upon by bishops 
and universities and the Vatican, that will better ensure the 
Catholic nature of our institutions of higher education, even as 
they continue to participate in the broader context of American 
higher education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tall order.  
</P>
<P>
	The most important proposal on Leibrecht's desk comes from the  
Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, with the added 
endorsement of the Jesuit college organization and three major 
groups of Catholic scholars. It would delete the specific demands 
in the Vatican-inspired draft in favor of a vaguer commitment to 
``Catholic ideals, principles and attitudes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monika Hellwig, executive director of the ACCU, contends that  
unless the bishops shift to a less legalistic policy, colleges will 
be saddled with problems over contracts, accreditation, and public 
aid. ``Some of the small colleges would absolutely not survive,'' 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
	After an April visit to Rome, Hellwig is convinced that the top  
officials of the Vatican education congregation are not pushing for 
a tougher policy. She thinks pressure is coming from lower-ranking 
Vatican staffers, especially in the agency that enforces canon law. 
But if the American bishops back the ACCU's plea for a softer 
policy, says Hellwig, the matter could be appealed to the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	Hellwig is confident that a majority of bishops will favor  
something like the policy that her colleges want. ``However, what 
we really need to make a strong case in Rome is the same kind of 
majority we got the first time around.'' The bishops' 1996 approval 
was nearly unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have our work cut out for us,'' she acknowledges. One  
factor is that only 57 of the 221 Catholic dioceses contain 
church-related colleges where educators can influence bishops. 
Hellwig says that ``bishops who don't have colleges are not 
informed, but they vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor of unknown impact is the Cardinal Newman Society,  
which was formed six years ago to lobby for strict application of 
the pope's 1990 decree. For instance, the society is protesting 
that 21 Catholic colleges invited commencement speakers this year 
who hold pro-choice views on abortion. The society is backed by 28 
prominent Catholics, including the presidents of five conservative 
Catholic colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Reilly, the society's executive director, contends that  
the ACCU has spent nine years preventing implementation of the 
pope's policy and calls the latest ACCU proposal ``irrelevant and 
unhelpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Respect for church authority and teaching is the first step  
toward maintaining Catholic identity,'' Reilly complains. ``At some 
Catholic universities, the disrespect is palpable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Marsden, a Protestant historian teaching at the  
University of Notre Dame, thinks today's Catholic schools are 
similar to Yale or Princeton in the 1920s when they were still 
talking about their Protestant identity but on the path toward 
secularization. 
</P>
<P>
	``The richness of America is enhanced if we have Catholic  
institutions,'' Marsden believes, so he would like to see strongly 
religious campuses. ``If you dismantle the supporting institutions 
of subcultures, you create a national culture unable to find its 
moral bearings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Vatican is right to be concerned, but it can't be done the  
way they want to do it without causing tremendous reaction.'' If 
Catholic schools are to remain identifiably Catholic, he believes, 
it will not be the doing of bishops from outside but their own 
administrators and faculty members.

<HEADLINE> Husband Arrested in Wife's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YUTAN, Neb. (AP) -- The body of Sandy Schnabel was found under  
her burned and smashed minivan in what appeared to be a fiery auto 
wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors now believe her husband either planned his  
wife's death or beat her in a fit of passion and then placed her 
under the torched minivan to cover up the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Schnabel, 43, was arrested Wednesday -- at his wife's  
funeral service -- and booked on suspicion of criminal homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Tom Jaudzemis said Thursday that the couple had been  
having marital and financial difficulties and that Schnabel had 
taken a $200,000 life insurance policy out on his wife about a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``She may have been alive when placed under that van and died of  
burns,'' Jaudzemis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Schnabel, 40, taught business and computer courses for 12  
years at Yutan High School. She also coached varsity volleyball. 
Her teams won a state championship in 1992 and competed in the 
tournament seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a great lady,'' said Deb Wagner, computer coordinator  
at the school. ``She never had anything bad to say about anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Schnabel's students and the couple's three children were  
among the roughly 1,000 people who attended the funeral. It was 
after the burial service that Schnabel was led away in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities initially attributed Mrs. Schnabel's death to a  
traffic accident, but within hours began suspecting foul play. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in this farm community of 1,400 were surprised by the  
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until this morning, I thought Mark was innocent, and I  
still don't know,'' said Yutan High School Superintendent Kevin 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Two passersby said they spotted the fire on the couple's farm,  
just yards away from their home, at about 1 a.m. Saturday. They 
said they awakened Schnabel, who called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnabel's attorney, Chuck Forrest, said his client is innocent  
and was in bed after last seeing his wife at 10 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jaudzemis said it is unlikely Schnabel could have slept  
through the crash and the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Schnabel's skull had been fractured and she had broken  
ribs. During a search Wednesday of the couple's farm, blood was 
found spattered on the walls and ceiling, and a vehicle owned by 
Schnabel had blood in it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schnabels' three children, ages 4, 6 and 9, are staying with  
their grandparents. The couple had been married since 1986.

<HEADLINE> Funding for Discount Internet OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schools and libraries will share $2.25 billion  
for Internet hookups and other communications services under a 
federal decision Thursday to approve the maximum funding allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission approved the amount, an  
increase of nearly $1 billion from current levels, despite concerns 
that it would cause higher telephone charges. The money is 
collected from phone companies, which usually pass on the fees to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three commissioners supported the maximum level, and two  
opposed. Commissioner Michael Powell said he would have supported a 
lower amount, but not $2.25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The funding will help wire 528,000 poorer or rural classrooms to  
the Internet, benefiting some 40 million kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``Success in the next millennium will be more and more dependent  
on access to information,'' said Bob Chase, president of the 
National Education Association. ``Now, all Americans, regardless of 
age, income level or geographic location, will have the opportunity 
to learn anything in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard Riley called the commission's action  
``a very significant step toward preparing America's students for 
the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, under its rules, is allowed to set aside up to  
$2.25 billion a year for the education-rate program, or E-rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics fear the full funding will lead to higher phone bills.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every billion dollars of direct fees is $10 per household, per  
year in America,'' said Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the 
other dissenter on the funding level. 
</P>
<P>
	His calculations translate to $22.50 per household each year.  
But the chief of the commission's Common Carrier Bureau, Larry 
Strickling, offered a cost of about $4 a year per phone line. He 
said the program gets some of its costs from wireless subscribers, 
who were not included in the staff calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents say the increase will be offset by some $1 billion  
worth of savings expected later this year in certain long-distance 
telephone fees. Those reductions, however, have come into question 
since a federal appeals court ruled last week that there was 
inadequate explanation for the way the fees were calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to criticisms about cost, FCC Chairman Bill Kennard  
said, ``We can't afford to leave poor kids in America in the dark 
ages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission last year scaled back the program's budget after  
consumer groups and some lawmakers called for cuts or halts in 
funding. Instead, the commission authorized $1.93 billion for the 
program's first 18 months, a rate of about $1.3 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 32,000 applications already have been filed for the  
program's second full fiscal year, which begins July 1. Demand is 
estimated to total $2.44 billion -- more than the $2.25 billion 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said the program should be able to fund all  
requests for Internet access and telecommunications services such 
as telephones and satellites. Money would be left to fill only some 
of the requests for internal wiring.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Regales Fans With Bawdy Tales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YORBA LINDA, Calif. (AP) -- Now it's Jesse ``The Bawdy'' Ventura.  
</P>
<P>
	The governor of Minnesota regaled admirers Thursday at the  
Richard Nixon Library &AMP; Birthplace with the off-color stories of 
his Navy years and detailed his rise from professional wrestler to 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoting his book, ``I Ain't Got Time to Bleed: Reworking the  
Body Politic from the Bottom Up,'' Ventura had no apologies for its 
bluntness and instead invoked Jack Nicholson's ``You can't handle 
the truth'' speech from the movie ``A Few Good Men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people can't handle it because sometimes the truth  
hurts,'' Ventura told an audience of 600 that included senior 
citizens, fellow Reform Party members and youths who overflowed the 
library auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor was referring to parts of the book detailing his  
visit to a Nevada brothel when he was a Navy SEAL -- passages 
criticized as a bad example for young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I better not do this because 25 years from now I might be a  
role model? The thought never entered this thick Slovak head,'' 
Ventura said.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Cellulite Supplement Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dietary supplement that claims to help women  
reduce cellulite is under scrutiny by federal regulators, who want 
to determine if the company can substantiate those claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The makers of Cellasene launched a campaign this week to dispel  
skepticism about the supplement by releasing studies on the 
product. But the Federal Trade Commission is nonetheless looking 
into whether the company can back up its advertising claims, 
according to a source familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
	FTC spokeswoman Vicki Streitfeld declined to confirm whether  
Cellasene is under investigation. Typically, the agency does not 
publicly say whether it is investigating a company. Debbie 
DeSantis, vice president of Cellasene's Italian manufacturer, 
Medestea Internazionale, also declined to comment on whether 
regulators are reviewing the product. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellasene entered the U.S. market in early March, making a big  
splash on the advertising pages of fashion magazines and flying off 
the shelves in some drug stores with its claims of reducing 
cellulite -- the pesky pockets of fat that cause the area around 
women's hips and thighs to appear dimpled. 
</P>
<P>
	The pills, available at major drug and retail stores, cost about  
$40 for a two-week supply. Vitamin maker Rexall Sundown Inc., based 
in Boca Raton, Fla., has the U.S. distribution rights to Cellasene. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Medestea Internazionale placed a full-page ad in The  
New York Times directed at ``the millions of women who are taking 
Cellasene or who are thinking about it'' and who have questions 
about supporting research. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, the company released studies it said backed the  
assertions about the supplement's effectiveness. It claimed Italian 
studies, using several dozen women, demonstrated that women could 
reduce their hip and thigh circumference within eight weeks of 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some groups who reviewed the data dismissed its findings and  
said the methodology was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel there is sufficient evidence to be mounting this  
campaign for an expensive product,'' said David Schardt of the 
consumer advocacy Center for Science in the Public Interest. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a study of 25 women, with 15 taking dummy pills,  
was done ``single-blind,'' meaning that those taking the 
measurements knew which women were using the supplement. Schardt 
said this could make investigators ``subject to observer bias'' and 
leave open the possibility for human error in measuring changes in 
circumference. 
</P>
<P>
	Schardt also said the study did not measure changes in visual  
appearance and feel of fat deposits -- what most women associate 
with cellulite. Another U.S. pilot study under way, which uses 10 
women as subjects, will be too small to prove anything further, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The makers of Cellasene said they are confident enough about the  
research results to push ahead with a study involving 200 women at 
the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	DeSantis, of Medestea Internazionale, said that study also will  
look at other benefits accrued from using the product, such as body 
shaping in the ankle and arms. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is expanding its research ``not because we believe  
the Italian study isn't valid, but to further investigate the 
benefits of Cellasene,'' said DeSantis, who expects results by 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, dietary supplements cannot promise to treat or prevent  
disease directly. But other than that, the industry is shielded 
from government oversight by a 1994 act of Congress. Lawmakers said 
the Food and Drug Administration is supposed to intercede only if 
the agency proves a supplement poses an unreasonable risk or is 
marketed as a drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC oversees truth-in-advertising issues and has the  
authority to take action against companies that cannot back up 
their claims. The agency has filed 66 cases against makers of 
dietary supplements in the last 15 years and in November issued 
guidelines on truthful advertising.

<HEADLINE> Wheel Tethers Used in Indy Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indy Racing League doesn't know how well  
its new wheel tethers will work in a crash. The drivers, naturally, 
hope they never find out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably the appropriate reaction to the things that have  
happened. But I don't want to be the first to test it,'' Buzz 
Calkins said after the final practice for Sunday's Indianapolis 
500. 
</P>
<P>
	The cars are now fitted with cables designed to keep the wheels  
and suspension parts from flying into the crowd during a wreck. 
Debris killed three fans and injured eight others at an Indy Racing 
League event in Concord, N.C., on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The wheel tethers were used for the first time during the  
Carburetion Day practice Thursday at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
There were no crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything we can do to make the fans safer, I'm all in favor of  
that,'' said Tony Stewart, who will race at Indy and in NASCAR's 
Coca-Cola 600 in Concord on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	After practice, IRL president Tony George sought to quell  
speculation of a possible end to the feud with CART, which has kept 
most of the top open-wheel drivers away from Indy since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	George met last week with Andrew Craig, CART's chief executive  
officer, but no deal was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we have different philosophies, we're never going  
to strike any kind of accord,'' George said. ``I can't say I'm 
encouraged by anything we talked about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL moved forward with its plans to improve safety beyond  
Sunday's race, announcing a change in engine rules beginning with 
the June 12 event at Texas Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Engines must operate at no more than 10,000 rpms after the Indy  
500, a reduction from the current limit of 10,300. The change will 
reduce the cars' horsepower and should slow speeds by at least 5 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the incident at Charlotte, we need to try to contain the  
speeds as much as we can,'' said IRL executive director Leo Mehl. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Guerrero knows all too well the dangers of flying  
debris. He was seriously injured in 1987 when a wheel hit his head 
in a wreck during fall testing at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	He has mixed feelings about the tethers because the wheels could  
now bounce back and hit drivers during crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me a little wary, but at the same time, I know it's  
something that needs to be done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As it was, the spectators were too much at risk. We're paid to  
take a risk, they're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rival Championship Auto Racing Teams is using a similar  
safety system and NASCAR might soon do the same. Formula One began 
using the cables on wheels this season, before the deaths in North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``Manufacturers have done a tremendous job in examining the  
problem and coming up with the best solution,'' IRL driver Billy 
Boat said. ``Whether the cable fails or not is probably not the 
issue. Regardless, it's still going to absorb energy, and it's 
going to slow that wheel if it does come disconnected from the 
car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two weeks, Boat crashed twice during practice and a  
third time on a warmup lap before qualifications. In one of his 
crashes, a wheel broke loose and bounced high into the air but did 
not go over the 19-foot-8 catch fence. 
</P>
<P>
	The cables connect the front and rear hubs and are attached to  
the farthest points from the driver on the car's frame. CART also 
tested its tethers for the first time Thursday in practice for the 
Motorola 300 at Madison, Ill., on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three spectators also were killed in a CART race at Michigan  
last year. One spectator was struck by a tire and killed at 
Indianapolis in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't hurt people. Bottom line, you can't,'' said Mark  
Dismore, who also crashed during practice last week. ``There's 
still a risk there, regardless, but we've got to do this. You're 
still going to see some things come detached, but they're not going 
to come detached at 230 mph.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Schmidt, Arie Luyendyk's teammate, was the fastest in  
Thursday's practice at 222.458 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly didn't go out there to have the fastest time of  
the day,'' Schmidt said. ``It just so happened I had a clear lap 
and popped off a good one. The car was solid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only starter who did not practice was Robby Gordon, who was  
in Madison practicing for the CART race. Greg Ray, his Menard 
teammate and a front-row starter between Luyendyk and Boat, was 
second-fastest at 221.822 mph in his own car and third-fastest at 
221.790 in Gordon's car. 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk, the two-time champion who will retire after Sunday's  
race, was the fourth-quickest at 221.380, followed by Hideshi 
Matsuda at 221.185, Tyce Carlson at 221.114 and Tony Stewart at 
221.098. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody did a pretty good job today,'' Schmidt said. ``I  
didn't see any bonehead moves out there.''

<HEADLINE> Indy 500 Champ a Man in Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eddie Cheever was sitting in front of his  
garage at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, autographing a stack of 
pictures on fan day, when a man walked up with his young son. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the guy who won the race last year,'' the father told  
his son, who gazed up at the driver with reverence. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever, the journeyman-turned-defending champion, seized the  
moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the man who's going to win the race this year,'' he  
quipped with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a witty retort, but Cheever seriously relishes the  
thought of joining an elite group that includes Wilbur Shaw, Mauri 
Rose, Bill Vukovich and Al Unser Sr. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every fiber in my body wants to win this race again,'' said  
Cheever, who will start from the inside of sixth row for the Indy 
500 on Sunday. ``Only a few guys have won the 500. Even less have 
won it two times in a row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever and the other 32 starters will make their final tune-up  
for the race today in a two-hour practice known as ``Carburetion 
Day,'' the only time between the end of qualifying and the race 
they're allowed on the 2 1/2-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Cheever was very much in demand Wednesday  
afternoon as thousands of fans converged on the speedway for 
``Community Day,'' taking advantage of a chance to mingle with the 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	A long line queued up at Cheever's garage for his hour-long  
autograph session, stretching around the building for him to sign 
pictures, hats, shirts, bricks, helmets and ticket stubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life changes after you win the 500,'' said Glenn Barton, who  
collected Cheever's autograph with his two young sons. ``He's a 
historical figure now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever refused to concede that the title of Indy 500 champion  
has lost its luster in recent years, despite all evidence to the 
contrary. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the 4-year-old war between the Indy Racing League and its  
more established rival, Championship Auto Racing Teams, has divided 
the open-wheel competition as NASCAR is booming in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cheever's aching right hand told a different story -- ``I've  
been signing stuff nonstop since I got to Indy'' -- and he's treated 
more reverently by the fans. People who used to call him ``Eddie'' 
now refer to him as ``Mr. Cheever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Eddie better,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In his younger days, Cheever was perceived as aloof and maybe a  
bit arrogant, the product of racing in the tunnel-vision world of 
Formula One from 1978-89. Now, at 41, he's a kinder, gentler man 
going through life at 220 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot more patience than I used to have,'' said  
Cheever, who will start Sunday's race from the inside of the sixth 
row. ``I guess I found something I like, which is racing on ovals. 
It's ridiculous, too. My whole background is in road racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, from the devilish look in his hazel eyes, he's enjoyed  
the fruits of his Indy triumph, though he's a bit short of 
specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look, I'm a 41-year-old bachelor who's the Indy 500  
champion,'' Cheever said, grinning. ``That's all I'm going to say 
on that subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The more material benefits are harder to uncover, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Cheever's face didn't adorn a box of Wheaties after his Indy  
victory, nor did he land a big-time sponsorship for his self-owned 
team. In fact, the obscure potato chip company that backed him a 
year ago pulled most of its money. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Cheevermobile is supported by Children's Beverage  
Group, a little-known Texas company that makes packaging for kids' 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Barnes, president of a California marketing firm that  
works with a number of former 500 champions, said it's difficult to 
sell open-wheel racing to corporate America as long as there's a 
split between the IRL and CART. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie is a terrific spokesperson,'' Barnes said. ``I think  
he's capitalized as much as possible under the circumstances. 
Obviously, there's not as much focus on the Indy 500 as there used 
to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Cheever doesn't sound all that excited about talks  
to end the IRL-CART feud. Like a seasoned PR man, he quickly 
espouses the IRL's mantra of keeping costs under control, promoting 
competition and focusing on American-based oval racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``To even consider backing down from that philosophy so the IRL  
could incorporate another series would be a serious mistake,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Cheever has his eyes on other goals. He is trying to  
start his own NASCAR Winston Cup team, saying there's a 70-percent 
chance he'll be racing with the good ol' boys next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``See you next year at Daytona,'' a woman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cheever chuckled at the thought of a life going full circle.

<HEADLINE> Dunlap's Double-Eagle Shot of Day  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOMAC, Md. (AP) -- Scott Dunlap made only the third double  
eagle in Kemper Open history Thursday when his 3-iron second shot 
found the pin from 218 yards at the sixth hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ripped a low cut and I was hoping to get it there,'' Dunlap  
said. ``I thought it rolled past the hole. I was giving the club 
back to my caddie and I heard the crowd go ballistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shot moved Dunlap from level par to 3-under, which was also  
his score at the end of the round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a dicey shot,'' he said. ``You miss and you get six.  
But I'm the kind of guy that goes down swinging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The previous double eagles at the Kemper also came at the  
520-yard sixth, which has a dogleg to the right and a creek in 
front of the green. Mark Brooks made the hole in 2 in the third 
round in 1991, and Woody Austin did the same in the first round 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DADDY ELS:* Ernie Els bypassed the Kemper Open to play in  
Europe this week, but golf isn't the first thing on his mind right 
now anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time U.S. Open champion became a father for the first  
time this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent the whole day on the phone after the birth,'' Els said  
Thursday. ``It was like winning a major.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Els' wife, Liezl, gave birth to the 8-pound girl on Wednesday.  
They were married in South Africa on New Year's Eve, but also have 
homes in Orlando, Fla., and in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Els is still planning to play in the Volvo PGA Championship,  
which starts Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Golf right now is not at the top of the agenda,'' Els said.  
``I'm just going to play and see what happens. But I'm not worried 
either way. Everything is healthy, and that's the most important 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Els said his daughter probably will be named Samantha.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GREEN LIGHT FOR BROWNE:* Olin Browne's victory in last week's  
Colonial has earned him a spot in the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne was granted a special exemption Thursday by the United  
States Golf Association to play in the June 17-20 major at 
Pinehurst, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne was given the exemption because he has won twice on the  
PGA Tour since last year's U.S. Open. His other victory came at the 
1998 Hartford Open. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BORN UNAMERICAN:* Brian Watts can't understand why he's not  
eligible for the Ryder Cup. Although born in Canada, he's lived in 
the United States since he was 6 months old and became a citizen 
when he was 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would do anything for my country,'' said Watts, the surprise  
story of 1998 when he finished second at the British Open. ``I find 
it is a very strange ruling, especially when you look at the 
Olympics. You have got Olympians that only get their citizenship to 
play on the U.S. team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA of America contends that only American-born players can  
be considered for the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Daniel Snyder, whose $800 million offer to buy the  
Washington Redskins was approved this week by the NFL, made an 
appearance at the balcony overlooking the 18th hole. Snyder signed 
autographs before disappearing into the pavilion. ... Carlos 
Franco, winner earlier this month in New Orleans, was disqualified 
when he missed his tee time for unknown reasons. He had not 
contacted PGA Tour officials as of late Thursday. ... John Daly 
carded a triple-bogey 8 on the sixth hole. He shot a 78.

<HEADLINE> Refugees Use Net for News From Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) -- The weary Kosovo refugee sat quietly at a  
computer terminal for hours, searching the World Wide Web for 
images from the war-ravaged homeland he was forced to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	The grisly photographs he found overwhelmed Lulzim Dervishi. As  
images of mutilated, bullet-riddled bodies filled the screen before 
him, the 21-year-old put his head down, overcome with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to look at it,'' said Abedin Bajupag, a fellow  
refugee working here as a computer instructor and interpreter in 
the Internet Information Center. ``Every day, they look for 
relatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More and more ethnic Albanian refugees airlifted to sanctuary at  
Fort Dix are turning to cyberspace for news and information from 
Yugoslavia, getting updates from home in English and Albanian. They 
are also using the Web to search for lost relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,500 Kosovo refugees have been transported to this former  
Army basic training facility from camps in Macedonia for 
resettlement in communities around the country. The United States 
has agreed to accept up to 20,000 of the hundreds of thousands who 
have fled since NATO bombings began in Yugoslavia in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In an Internet center set up in an air-conditioned construction  
trailer at Fort Dix, more than two dozen refugees gathered 
Wednesday at a row of a dozen computers donated by Apple. 
</P>
<P>
	With a click of the mouse, they accessed Web sites that allowed  
them to read news accounts in their native language from familiar 
and trusted sources such as the weekly Albanian newspaper ``Voice 
of Kosova,'' or take in Albanian television reports and radio 
segments from Pristina, the capital of the Kosovo province, on 
Radio 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're only looking at stuff they can understand,'' said Dave  
Zweigel, who is supervising the center for the U.S. Information 
Agency. ``They would look at CNN if it were in Albanian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many were drawn to the Internet site www.Alb-net.com, where they  
viewed graphic photo galleries of alleged war crimes by Serbian 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them are rather horrific,'' said Chris Dingman, a  
center volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	Selvie Berisha, 19, desperately wanted to see the images the  
site contends are evidence of the atrocities against women, 
children and the elderly, victims of ethnic cleansing. She fled her 
home in Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wants to see it. The computer helps her to know what is  
going on,'' an interpreter said for the young woman. ``She saw 
people without eyes. She's very sad. She thinks her relatives that 
are in Kosovo -- maybe they are dead. All night she thinks about 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The iMac computers were set up to allow the refugees easy  
Internet access with minimal supervision. Instructions are written 
on a blackboard in Albanian and key Web sites and links already are 
bookmarked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet Center, which opened last week, is staffed by  
volunteers, mainly from Macintosh user groups in New Jersey and 
Pennsylvania. It's open weekdays, but Zweigel said the hours will 
be expanded as demand increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Young refugee children sat at terminals side-by-side with their  
elders, patiently helping them navigate the Internet. Some sat with 
their heads bent listening closely to reports piped through 
computer speakers from the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and 
the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world divided us, the net brought us together, therefore  
the future shall keep us together,'' says a heading for the Kosova 
Crisis Center Web page. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only one refugee at Fort Dix has located a missing  
relative -- a cousin -- through the Internet, Zweigel said. But 
officials are hoping for more success stories and are helping 
refugees set up e-mail accounts. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Study Reveals Staph Vaccine Hopeful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new vaccine against staph infections, an  
increasingly dangerous threat to hospital patients, has been tested 
successfully in animals, researchers report. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, the  
vaccine was able to protect mice and rabbits from lethal doses of 
strains of staphylococcus aureus bacteria, researchers report today 
in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers worldwide are scrambling to find new vaccines  
against staph because the common bacterial infection is becoming 
more resistant to drugs such as penicillin. Some strains of staph 
now even are partially resistant to vancomycin, a drug that has 
been the last line of defense against the microbe. 
</P>
<P>
	Staph infections strike a half million American hospital  
patients a year, particularly those having heart valve surgery, 
knee and hip replacement, and kidney failure patients who are on 
dialysis. Outside the hospital, the microbe can cause infections 
ranging from skin abscesses to pneumonia, meningitis, and 
infections of the bone and heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gerald B. Pier, co-author of the Science study, said the  
vaccine he and his colleagues developed is based on a molecule that 
staph makes only when the microbe starts an infection inside the 
body. This molecule, called PNSG, normally is not seen in 
laboratory cultures of staph, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This molecule appears to be critical for infection and disease  
progression,'' Pier said. ``All staph aureus strains that we have 
looked at in the lab, and that's well over 50, have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pier and his co-workers isolated the PNSG molecule from staph  
infection specimens. They then injected purified PNSG into 
laboratory mice and rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
	In all cases, Pier said, the animals developed antibodies that  
reacted powerfully against staph bacteria. He said mice with such 
antibodies were injected with double-lethal doses of staph bacteria 
that was partially resistant to vancomycin. All of the test mice 
survived, he said, but 80 percent or more of the mice not protected 
by PNSG shots died of staph infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Pier said human trials of the PSNG vaccine should start within  
18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	When a staph vaccine is developed, Pier said it probably will be  
used most commonly to protect patients having surgery and people at 
high risk of burns or wounds, such as firemen, policemen and 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pier said it also may be possible to inject healthy people with  
a vaccine and then extract antibodies against staph. These 
antibodies could be injected into accident victims and others 
hospitalized unexpectedly. Such antibodies probably would protect 
against staph infections for up to two weeks, Pier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of  
Allergy and Infections, said the vaccine research was ``a hopeful 
step against a very worrisome pathogen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fauci, in a statement, said that emerging strains of staph that  
are partially resistant to vancomycin are ``most troubling'' and 
that ``new treatments and ... and effective vaccine are urgently 
needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nabi, a drug company in Boca Raton, Fla., is conducting clinical  
trials of a staph vaccine among 1,800 patients who are on dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nabi vaccine is based on molecules that are different from  
the ones in the vaccine under study by Pier and his group. Results 
of Nabi's vaccine study will be announced late next year, company 
official Tanina Frouge said.

<HEADLINE> Charter Buying Another Cable TV Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Paul Allen's Charter Communications Inc. is  
making its second cable television acquisition in two days, 
announcing today it is buying Fanch Communications Inc. Terms were 
not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal for Denver-based Fanch comes a day after Charter  
disclosed it had agreed to acquire Falcon Cable TV of Los Angeles 
for $3.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	It is part of a buying spree that is making Charter one of the  
nation's biggest cable system owners, ranking behind only AT&AMP;T 
Corp., Time Warner Inc. and Comcast Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanch has about 547,000 subscribers, boosting Charter's base of  
subscribers to about 5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who co-founded Microsoft Corp. with Bill Gates, purchased  
Charter in July 1998 and has spent about $16 billion on cable 
purchases over the past past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter is buying the Fanch properties from a group that  
includes two funds managed by the Blackstone Group of New York, 
Narragansett Capital Partners and some affiliates of Fanch. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanch has 308,000 customers in West Virginia and Pennsylvania,  
bringing Charter's presence in those states to about 400,000 when 
other deals are completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanch also has 140,000 customers in Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky,  
Louisiana and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcon deal brings Charter 1 million subscribers in 27  
states.

<HEADLINE> Hospital Releases Tampa's Saunders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay Devil Rays pitcher Tony  
Saunders, who broke his left arm delivering a pitch, was released 
from Bayfront Medical Center Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders broke the humerus bone, which runs from the shoulder to  
the elbow, in the Devil Rays' 8-6 loss to the Texas Rangers 
Wednesday night. He will miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony is still in some discomfort, but the doctors feel that  
will go away in the next day or so,'' Tampa Bay general manager 
Chuck LaMar said. ``He's in fine spirits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors set the bone Wednesday night and a team official said no  
surgery will be required. The injury will require at least three to 
four months of healing time. 
</P>
<P>
	While remaining optimistic the 25-year-old Saunders might return  
next season, LaMar admitted the left-hander faces a tough battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to do everything we possibly can to help Tony both  
physically and mentally. He's going to have a battle with both,'' 
LaMar said. ``If everything falls right, Tony will pitch in the 
major leagues next year ... but there's so much water to go under 
the bridge there's just no way the doctors or this organization 
and, more importantly, Tony can point because it's so far down the 
road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders broke the same bone Dave Dravecky broke while throwing  
his final pitch in the majors for San Francisco on Aug. 15, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's Tom Browning broke his left arm while throwing a  
pitch in a game in 1994 and never was an effective major league 
pitcher again. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's John Smiley broke his left humerus while warming up  
for a game in 1997 and has not pitched in the majors since. He 
remains with the team, hoping for a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	LaMar spoke with several baseball officials Thursday, including  
Cleveland general manager John Hart -- who was involved with 
Smiley's rehab program. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a situation that a gentleman that made his living by  
using that left arm has to eventually get over the tramatic 
experience of the pitch he threw. From the people we talked to, 
that will be as tough a battle, if not tougher, than the physical 
situation,'' LaMar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders' release from the hospital came the same day as the  
Devil Rays -- mired in a season-high five-game losing streak -- 
departed for Seattle to start a six-game road trip. While keeping 
Saunders in their thoughts, the Devil Rays realize their focus must 
return to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not going to cancel the schedule,'' Tampa Bay pitching  
coach Rick Williams said. ``We've got to keep pitching, keep 
competing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders will be the 14th player -- tops in the majors -- placed on  
the DL by the Devil Rays this season. LaMar said the biggest 
on-field challenge facing the second-year team is not letting 
injuries -- which also sidelined starting pitcher Rolando Arrojo and 
centerfielder Quinton McCracken this week -- become an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do that, we'll take a step back as an organization,''  
LaMar said. ``If that competitive attitude seeps away, then we're 
taking a step back. I don't think that will happen ... we have too 
much character in the clubhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders faced a first-and-third jam in the third inning when he  
made a 3-2 pitch to Juan Gonzalez. Ball four was 10 feet wide of 
the plate for a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders hopped to the edge of the mound and fell in a heap.  
Devil Rays players rushed to him, along with manager Larry 
Rothschild, the training staff and medical personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher John Flaherty held Saunders' right hand. Several of  
Tampa Bay's players in the dugout covered their eyes while Saunders 
writhed on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we take it for granted that we're able to go out  
there all the time and perform,'' Devil Rays pitcher Bobby Witt 
said. ``When something like this happens, it's kind of 
unexplainable. What's happened lately gives you a little 
reality.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Accepts Award for Reagan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ronald Reagan may have earned the title  
Conservative of the Century, but it was presidential contender John 
McCain who picked up the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Former first lady Nancy Reagan designated McCain to accept the  
honor bestowed on her husband Wednesday night by the American 
Conservative Union. The Arizona senator used the event to salute 
what he called the ``genius'' of the former leader of his party -- 
an unrelenting faith in freedom and patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew that America's efforts to help humanity secure the  
blessings of liberty are what truly distinguish us from all other 
nations on earth,'' McCain told a crowd of hundreds in a ballroom 
at the Washington Hilton, where Reagan was shot in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said Reagan's legacy of fighting against communism and  
other threats to the free world are still important lessons today. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't mean that we have to risk lives and resources  
needlessly, lurching ineffectually from one crisis to another,'' 
McCain said. ``But it does mean that we should defend our interests 
and values when they are threatened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the nation should adhere to Reagan's guiding principles  
of being ``sure of ourselves, firm in our purpose and proud of our 
heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican senator has spoken out several times on U.S.  
action in Kosovo, notably to criticize President Clinton for ruling 
out the use of ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a former prisoner of war, said then-Governor Reagan also  
served as a personal inspiration for him during his captivity. When 
McCain returned home from Vietnam, he discovered that many 
prominent figures in the country spoke pessimistically about 
America's future. But unlike them, Reagan believed in the nation's 
claim to greatness, McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of that, Ronald Reagan was supremely confident, and he became  
president to prove it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> IRL Chief Douses CART Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indy Racing League is no closer to  
ending its feud with rival CART, despite talks aimed at bringing 
the two sides together, IRL's president said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In his most extensive comments on the 4-year-old split in  
American open-wheel racing, Tony George accused CART of fueling 
reports of a reconciliation to boost its stock price, soothe 
sponsors and divert attention from the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	While admitting once again that it would be difficult for both  
series to survive, George said he got no indication of common 
ground at a meeting last week with Andrew Craig, chief executive 
officer of Championship Auto Racing Teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we have different philosophies, we're never going  
to strike any kind of accord,'' George said. ``I can't say I'm 
encouraged by anything we talked about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George, also president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, began  
the IRL in late 1995 as a low-cost, ovals-only alternative to CART. 
The older organization responded by boycotting the Indy 500, taking 
away some of the luster from the world's most famous race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to compromise ourselves just to get them back  
here,'' said George, preparing for his fourth 500 without CART. 
``It's as simple as that. The IRL is doing very well with its 
growth at this stage. Obviously, we've shown we don't need them to 
have a successful event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CART, which holds the Motorola 300 at Madison, Ill., on  
Saturday, is making plans to expand its 20-race schedule to other 
overseas markets, mentioning Germany and Mexico as possible sites. 
But Craig stressed his teams also want to go back to Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we are attempting to do is to act in good faith for what  
we believe is in the best interest of the sport and the fans,'' 
Craig said after being told of George's comments. ``We have made no 
secret of the fact that all our teams would like to race in 
Indianapolis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides face major hurdles, such as totally different  
chassis and engine specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea where all the speculation is coming from,''  
Craig said. ``We strongly believe that it's best not to comment on 
any of these specific issues at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George said he met with Craig in March and they got together  
again last week in Indianapolis. George also has met with NASCAR 
chief Bill France Jr., portrayed as the potential broker of a deal 
between the two open-wheel series. 
</P>
<P>
	France's International Speedway Corp., which owns and operates  
NASCAR, recently bought Penske Motorsports. That gave ISC 10 
racetracks, with at least three more planned in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	George said his talks with Craig focused on their general  
support for open-wheel racing, but didn't focus on specifics for 
bringing the two sides together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, he wasn't trying to cast himself as someone who has  
all the answers,'' George said. ``It was more to express an 
interest in what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though nearly all of the most-established drivers remained with  
CART after the split, George clearly feels he has the upper hand 
because the IRL has the Indy 500. He said talk of a merger is 
merely an attempt to bolster CART, which is a publicly traded 
company on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to continue to give some glimmer of hope that  
something is in the offing to help keep their stock price where 
they want it to be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	George's right-hand man, IRL executive director Leo Mehl, also  
gave little hint of a compromise earlier Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call it the May whine,'' Mehl said. ``Those CART guys are  
very concerned with what's going on here. If they come back here 
with the same engines we use, the same chassis, they'll get their 
doors blown off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George and Mehl said there would be no attempt to reach a deal  
that would allow the CART teams to return to the Indy 500 unless 
they run the other 10 IRL races, too. 
</P>
<P>
	George conceded that neither open-wheel series is likely to  
reach the popularity of NASCAR's stock-car series unless they 
merge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later, it will have to come to just one series for  
it to flourish,'' George said. ``I don't know and I don't have a 
crystal ball to predict what that outcome might be.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Officials Prepare Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Olympic officials will provide a detailed  
response to a congressional inquiry into the city's bid for the 
1996 Summer Games early next week, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation will provide a far more  
thorough response than the one prepared for an IOC investigation of 
the bid cities from 1996 through 2004, spokesman Lee Echols said. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry will be ``a good opportunity to start clearing the  
air on some of these issues,'' Echols told The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the House Commerce Committee has questions about  
excessive gifts, favors and visits offered to International Olympic 
Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee, which looked into the scandal that tainted Salt  
Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics, is now trying to 
determine whether Atlanta bidders bribed IOC delegates in return 
for votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta Olympic organizers have admitted to exceeding spending  
limits on gifts for IOC members, but told IOC investigators in 
March that they did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional investigators will be examining Olympic records  
contained in 1,400 boxes at the Atlanta History Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation, which is embroiled in  
a legal fight with members of the media to keep some bid records 
sealed, recently opened the nine boxes of documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The records are also at the center of a legal dispute over  
whether the public should be allowed to view documents detailing 
Atlanta's bid for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The released records included scores of thank-you notes,  
fund-raising letters, newspaper articles and marketing plans, 
including one that warned Atlanta leaders that ``lobbying the 
90-member IOC voting bloc is tricky business, not unlike walking 
through a minefield at midnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, they showed no evidence of the problems that tarnished  
Salt Lake City's Olympic bid.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Cellulite Supplement Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dietary supplement that claims to help women  
reduce cellulite is under scrutiny by federal regulators, who want 
to determine if the company can substantiate those claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The makers of Cellasene launched a campaign this week to dispel  
skepticism about the supplement by releasing studies on the 
product. But the Federal Trade Commission is nonetheless looking 
into whether the company can back up its advertising claims, 
according to a source familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
	FTC spokeswoman Vicki Streitfeld declined to confirm whether  
Cellasene is under investigation. Typically, the agency does not 
publicly say whether it is investigating a company. Debbie 
DeSantis, vice president of Cellasene's Italian manufacturer, 
Medestea Internazionale, also declined to comment on whether 
regulators are reviewing the product. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellasene entered the U.S. market in early March, making a big  
splash on the advertising pages of fashion magazines and flying off 
the shelves in some drug stores with its claims of reducing 
cellulite -- the pesky pockets of fat that cause the area around 
women's hips and thighs to appear dimpled. 
</P>
<P>
	The pills, available at major drug and retail stores, cost about  
$40 for a two-week supply. Vitamin maker Rexall Sundown Inc., based 
in Boca Raton, Fla., has the U.S. distribution rights to Cellasene. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Medestea Internazionale placed a full-page ad in The  
New York Times directed at ``the millions of women who are taking 
Cellasene or who are thinking about it'' and who have questions 
about supporting research. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, the company released studies it said backed the  
assertions about the supplement's effectiveness. It claimed Italian 
studies, using several dozen women, demonstrated that women could 
reduce their hip and thigh circumference within eight weeks of 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some groups who reviewed the data dismissed its findings and  
said the methodology was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel there is sufficient evidence to be mounting this  
campaign for an expensive product,'' said David Schardt of the 
consumer advocacy Center for Science in the Public Interest. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a study of 25 women, with 15 taking dummy pills,  
was done ``single-blind,'' meaning that those taking the 
measurements knew which women were using the supplement. Schardt 
said this could make investigators ``subject to observer bias'' and 
leave open the possibility for human error in measuring changes in 
circumference. 
</P>
<P>
	Schardt also said the study did not measure changes in visual  
appearance and feel of fat deposits -- what most women associate 
with cellulite. Another U.S. pilot study under way, which uses 10 
women as subjects, will be too small to prove anything further, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The makers of Cellasene said they are confident enough about the  
research results to push ahead with a study involving 200 women at 
the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	DeSantis, of Medestea Internazionale, said that study also will  
look at other benefits accrued from using the product, such as body 
shaping in the ankle and arms. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is expanding its research ``not because we believe  
the Italian study isn't valid, but to further investigate the 
benefits of Cellasene,'' said DeSantis, who expects results by 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, dietary supplements cannot promise to treat or prevent  
disease directly. But other than that, the industry is shielded 
from government oversight by a 1994 act of Congress. Lawmakers said 
the Food and Drug Administration is supposed to intercede only if 
the agency proves a supplement poses an unreasonable risk or is 
marketed as a drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC oversees truth-in-advertising issues and has the  
authority to take action against companies that cannot back up 
their claims. The agency has filed 66 cases against makers of 
dietary supplements in the last 15 years and in November issued 
guidelines on truthful advertising.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Mulls Internet Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Louisiana Republicans, planning to leap ahead  
of Iowa and New Hampshire with next year's first presidential 
preference vote, are also considering a leap technologically -- 
Internet balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	State party executive director Becky Miller said Thursday that  
the party's executive committee is likely to vote June 12 on 
whether to use an Internet voting system in a party primary 
election that could be held Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said the Internet proposal has been discussed at regional  
meetings around the state and that a recommendation to use Internet 
voting was made by the party's executive committee after a meeting 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Details have not been worked out but a company called  
VoteHere.net is working on a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	One advantage of the idea, Miller said, is that it could help  
avert the long lines and hours of waiting that some Republicans 
faced during 1996 state caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican legislators asked Thursday about the possibility of  
Internet voting expressed skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt we've had difficulties getting the caucuses  
to work,'' said state Sen. Tom Schedler. ``Whether the Internet is 
the answer, I just don't know. I'm open to the idea based on the 
past performance of caucuses but I'm worried about the access. How 
many Republicans have computers at home?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Limited access was the worry for Sen. Jay Dardenne, as well.  
</P>
<P>
	``My take on it is www.bad-idea.com,'' Dardenne said. ``Maybe  
I'm just a stick in the mud but I like the old fashioned way. I 
realize we're entering a new century, but I'm not sure we're ready 
for this yet. I think we have an access problem.

<P>
	``The way some may view the party, all Republicans have  
computers, but I'm not sure of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rep. Charles Lancaster said Internet voting could solve  
an array of problems. ``This is the best idea that I've seen in a 
couple of years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Access would be less of a problem under one scenario laid out by  
Miller. Rather than all registered Republicans voting from personal 
computers, ``block hosts'' in various areas would open their homes 
as balloting sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The number would be limited but there would be more than the 42  
used for 20,000 participants in the 1996 caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from long waits, the 1996 caucuses were widely criticized  
because major candidates avoided Louisiana in favor of the Iowa 
caucuses, traditionally the first in the nation. Despite the 
interstate party strife over the early date, Louisiana's GOP 
remains committed to hold the first preference vote again in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``To us this doesn't have anything to do with Iowa. This is  
about Louisiana,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Internet election system is approved, VoteHere.net  
officials said, it will likely be the nation's first primary vote 
by Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Some corporations have used Internet voting for shareholder  
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said the state party's plans will have to be complete and  
submitted to the Republican National Committee by July 1.

<HEADLINE> Virenque Wins Tour of Italy Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAPALLO, Italy (AP) -- Richard Virenque beat Santiago Blanco in a  
two-way sprint Thursday to capture the 13th stage of the Tour of 
Italy -- his first win in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The French cyclist, at the center of last year's Tour of France  
doping scandal, outsprinted the Spaniard at the finish line in this 
Italian riviera resort following a long-lasting breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque raised his arms in triumph as he crossed the finish  
line and shouted his joy for a long-waited victory following months 
of doping allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Frenchman, national champion Laurent Jalabert, retained  
the pink jersey of overall leader as he finished in the main group 
34 seconds behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Jalabert, who clinched the race leadership last Sunday, held a  
four-seconds lead over defending Giro champion Marco Pantani. 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque completed the spill-marred 150.6-mile distance from  
Sassuolo to Rapallo in 6 hours, 55 minutes, 34 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclists will rest Friday in the only day-off of the 22-stage  
Italian cycling marathon.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer-Writer Is Dead at Age 69 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Kent Hollingsworth, who shaped The  
Blood-Horse weekly magazine into one of the thoroughbred racing's 
most respected trade journals, is dead at the age of 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollingsworth, who served as editor, then publisher of The  
Blood-Horse from 1963-86, died Wednesday night at the University of 
Kentucky Medical Center. The cause of death was not known. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of St. Louis, Hollingsworth also was a lawyer and  
teacher. When he became editor of The Blood-Horse, the magazine had 
a circulation of 6,800 and a staff of 30. When he departed as 
publisher 23 years later, the circulation had reached 21,700 and 
the staff numbered 101. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Hollingsworth returned to the practice of law  
and served as a Distinguished Lecturer in equine law in the Equine 
Industry Program at the University of Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his journalism career as a news photographer and sports  
writer for the Lexington Leader in 1954. He also has authored five 
books.

president of the Thoroughbred Club of America from 1974-75; vice 
president of the National Museum of Racing at Saratoga Springs, 
N.Y., and chairman of the Racing Hall of Fame Committee from 
1982-86. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollingsworth donated his body to the University of Kentucky  
Medical Center for teaching purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his widow, Mary; six children: Val of

<HEADLINE> Palmer Group May Buy Pebble Beach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- A group of investors, including  
Arnold Palmer and Clint Eastwood, is negotiating to purchase the 
exclusive Pebble Beach golf resort -- and the pricetag could hit $1 
billion, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Golfweek magazine reported on its Web site Wednesday that  
Palmer's group is ``in serious negotiations'' to buy the luxury 
property from the Lone Cypress Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times, citing a source close to the  
negotiations, said ``pieces are still in motion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer confirmed to Golfweek's source that former baseball  
commissioner Peter Ueberroth, Eastwood and former United Airlines 
chief executive Richard J. Ferris belong to the group bidding on 
Pebble Beach, one of the nation's most prestigious golf courses 
open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferris, a close friend and business associate of Palmer and  
Ueberroth, is chairman of the PGA Tour's policy board. 
</P>
<P>
	If the reports are accurate, it would be the second time in the  
past 10 years that Pebble Beach has been sold by Japanese 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Lone Cypress, an investment partnership owned by Taiheiyo Club,  
Inc., a Japanese golf-resort company, and Sumitomo Credit Services 
Co., one of Japan's leading issuers of Visa cards, bought Pebble 
Beach Company from Minoru Isutani for an estimated $500 million in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said Ueberroth's group was negotiating with Lone  
Cypress Co., current owner of the resort, to acquire the Pebble 
Beach Co. -- which brings with it Pebble Beach Golf Links, Spyglass 
Hill, The Links at Spanish Bay, Del Monte Golf Course, two luxury 
hotels and the 17-Mile Drive that winds through Pebble Beach and 
nearby Del Monte Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peter has thought about Pebble Beach for some time,'' David  
Jay Flood, a Los Angeles architect and Ueberroth's longtime friend, 
told the Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
	Pebble Beach sources told Golfweek the deal is all but done.  
</P>
<P>
	Isutani lost a reported $350 million on its deal, having paid an  
estimated $850 million to a partnership led by oilman Marvin Davis 
for the resort in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Pebble Beach was nearly $20 million in the red for every month  
Isutani owned it, the Mercury News said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lone Cypress ran into local opposition to some of its  
development plans. The company is almost finished building a 
24-room lodge, the Casa Palmero resort and spa, and had plans to 
build a new golf course and develop more than 300 home sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The 99th U.S. Amateur will be played at Pebble Beach Golf Links  
and Spyglass Hill on Aug. 16-22, and Pebble Beach will host its 
fourth U.S. Open next summer.

<HEADLINE> Missing Atheist Aide Implicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- For the first time since Madalyn Murray  
O'Hair vanished in 1995, investigators said that the nation's 
foremost atheist and two of her children were killed, and that the 
crime was orchestrated by her former office manager in a plot to 
steal $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations came in a 36-page affidavit filed in court  
Wednesday by the IRS before a hearing for 52-year-old David R. 
Waters. 
</P>
<P>
	At the hearing on Thursday, Waters, a murder convict on  
probation for skimming $54,000 from the O'Hair family's atheist 
organizations, pleaded guilty to two gun possession charges 
unrelated to the O'Hair case. He could get up to 10 years in prison 
and a $250,000 fine on each count. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters has not charged in the disappearance of the O'Hairs.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Hair, who helped bring about the 1963 U.S. Supreme Court  
decision banning organized prayer in public school, vanished nearly 
four years ago with her son Jon Garth Murray, her granddaughter 
Robin Murray -- whom Ms. O'Hair had adopted -- and $500,000 in gold 
coins. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, authorities wondered whether the O'Hairs were  
victims of foul play or had merely run off with their 
organization's money. Others suggested that Ms. O'Hair, who was 77 
and ailing, had gone off to die quietly so Christians wouldn't pray 
over her. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit said that IRS agents had concluded that the family  
was killed, based on several pieces of circumstantial evidence and 
reports from confidential sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources told the government that Waters had expressed  
fantasies about killing Ms. O'Hair and ``spoke about seeing Madalyn 
suffer and snipping off her toes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit alleged that Waters schemed to steal at least  
$600,000 from the United Secularists of America, an organization 
headed by Ms. O'Hair. Waters worked for her in 1993 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities suspect the family's remains were stored in barrels  
and buried on a ranch near San Antonio. Two searches by the FBI 
recently failed to find either barrels or bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Also named in the affidavit is Waters' former cellmate, Gary  
Karr, who is imprisoned in Detroit and has admitted involvement in 
Texas homicides that closely match the O'Hair case, according to 
the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit also names Danny Fry in the alleged plot. Fry's  
headless, handless body was dumped in Texas two days after the 
O'Hairs vanished. The IRS said Waters was responsible for Fry's 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth man is also named, but his role was unclear.  
</P>
<P>
	``What it looks like to me is a script for Oliver Stone's next  
movie,'' said Waters' attorney, Patrick Ganne. ``They don't have 
any direct evidence to link him. It's all speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit was used in March to obtain a search warrant of  
his Austin apartment. The search yielded, among other items, 
personal correspondence of Jon Murray, the document said. 
</P>
<P>
	The search also turned up an unpublished book by Waters. In one  
typical passage, he wrote: ``To simply label Madalyn an atheist, 
racist, homophobe, anti-Semite, etc., would be a tremendous 
misnomer. To her dubious credit, Madalyn Mays Murray O'Hair is an 
equal-opportunity bigot whose loathing of humanity is eagerly 
dispensed without partiality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellen Johnson, president of the United Secularists, said she  
still holds out hope that Ms. O'Hair and her children are alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been digging and digging and digging and there aren't  
any bodies,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``I don't have any evidence they're 
alive. But they were dear friends and colleagues. There is no way 
I'm going to bury them yet.''

<HEADLINE> Hectic Hurricane Season Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Federal officials predicted a busier-than-usual  
Atlantic hurricane season today and urged people in hurricane-prone 
areas to think about how they will handle the storms. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  
Administration has issued a preseason forecast. It calls for three 
or more intense hurricanes -- two is normal -- and will be updated in 
August, at the height of the June-to-November season. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook was issued at the National Hurricane Center, during  
a news conference attended by officials from the National Weather 
Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters expect more hurricanes this year in part because of  
La Nina. The opposite of El Nino, La Nina brings cooler-than-normal 
temperatures to the part of the Pacific Ocean off South America 
that sees warmer water temperatures during El Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters anticipate two conditions that could facilitate  
hurricane development: low wind shear in parts of the Atlantic 
Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and a wind pattern off of west Africa 
that may feed developing storms. 
</P>
<P>
	Advances in technology are helping forecasters warn people more  
accurately and further in advance, but the public has to do its 
part, too, according to the weather service's director, Jack Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the final analysis, even a perfect warning is an academic  
exercise if people don't get it or haven't thought about what they 
would do,'' he warned. 
</P>
<P>
	During the recently completed annual session of the Florida  
Legislature, a statewide building code was proposed for Florida 
that would eliminate some strict code requirements already in place 
in South Florida to lessen hurricane damage. 
</P>
<P>
	FEMA Director James Lee Witt said he does not think it is his  
place to comment on state and local building codes. But, he was 
quick to add: ``I think we should build better, develop safer 
communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officials also took the occasion to urge all residents in  
areas that could be affected by hurricanes to heed any and all 
evacuation orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane center director Jerry Jarrell, however, also cautioned  
against unnecessary flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``You tend to have too many people evacuate,'' he said. ``Trust  
me, there's not enough roads to get us all to Atlanta.''

<HEADLINE> Katz Works To Rebuild ABC Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Howard Katz is rebuilding ABC Sports. It's nothing compared to  
what Sean McManus had to deal with when he took over at CBS three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Although ABC is struggling to re-establish its sports identity  
after being thought of as an extension of fellow Disney-owned ESPN, 
Katz has far more to work with than McManus did. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, ABC has ``Monday Night Football,'' the top-rated  
show on the network. It also has the Triple Crown, the top college 
football bowl games and a solid golf package. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely see some similarities there between the two  
situations,'' said Jim Spence, who worked for ABC for 25 years and 
runs a consulting agency. ``The image at CBS was pretty low, 
probably even lower than what ABC's is right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katz's first order of business since being hired as president of  
the sports division in March -- after ordering the walls at ABC to 
be painted -- was to secure a five-year deal with the Indianapolis 
500 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	With Indy's plummeting ratings, it may not seem like a big deal.  
But the network could not afford to lose a race with such 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indy is symbolically important for the network,'' Spence said.  
``Plus, my feeling is that there is going to be a settlement 
between the IRL and CART ... and I think Indy will become Indy 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two racing circuits have begun talks about a possible merger  
after four years of feuding. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up for Katz is the Triple Crown. ABC's deal expires after  
the Belmont Stakes on June 5 and the bidding figures to be far more 
competitive than for Indy. Fox, NBC and CBS should all be in the 
mix. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though CBS may be interested in landing the horse  
racing package, it is not such a necessity these days. 
</P>
<P>
	When McManus took over at CBS in December 1996, the network was  
in disarray. His priority was to reacquire the NFL, which he did a 
year later. Then he made certain to extend CBS' PGA coverage, U.S. 
Open tennis and Big Ten and SEC basketball packages. He also 
broadened the network's NASCAR coverage and locked up high-quality 
talents Jim Nantz and Phil Simms. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, less than three years later, CBS' sports division is among  
the elite. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz's challenge is to do the same.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to be able to restore ABC Sports to the level it once  
had,'' Katz said. ``One of my goals is to give a lift in morale 
around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the ways to keep employees' spirits high and restore the  
ABC tradition is to try to keep from being perceived as ``ESPN3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another would be to take advantage of the current dispute  
between Major League Baseball and ESPN, and pick up the baseball 
package if it becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	 *WHAT'S UP, DOC?:* Turner analyst Doc Rivers is a candidate for  
several NBA head coaching vacancies, despite limited experience 
that includes a stint as a CBA ``coach's aide'' during the NBA 
lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts also inquired  
about him -- not for a job as coach but as the New York Knicks' 
general manager to replace the fired Ernie Grunfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers, who played for the Knicks when coach Jeff Van Gundy was  
an assistant, would be interested in the GM job -- but he'd rather 
coach. Rivers interviewed for the Washington job and has been 
mentioned for the Orlando position. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Van Gundy shouldn't be fired.

<HEADLINE> AOL Conditions for Giving Cops Info </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some of America Online's conditions for releasing information on  
customers to investigators: 
</P>
<P>
	--No disclosure except under ``valid legal process'' such as  
search warrant, subpoena or other court order. 
</P>
<P>
	--Under a search warrant, AOL may turn over any relevant e-mail,  
similar content and personal identifying information. 
</P>
<P>
	--AOL says it generally keeps unread e-mail in its own system for  
28 days; e-mail that has been read for two days. Customers have the 
option of storing it longer on the server, as well as keeping it in 
their own computers. In the case of a Virginia customer charged 
with possessing child pornography, images sent by e-mail over 
nearly six months were found, the FBI says. 
</P>
<P>
	--In civil cases, AOL won't release e-mail but may give out  
personal identifying information in response to a subpoena or other 
court order. The member whose information is to be disclosed is 
given two weeks notice in case he or she wishes to contest the 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	--Public chat rooms are monitored for inappropriate content and  
AOL has a detailed process for handling complaints and terminating 
service to members who violate rules. 
</P>
<P>
	--AOL does not keep records of member passwords.  
</P>
<P>
	--The FBI keeps a database containing customer complaints that  
have been forwarded to the bureau by AOL, federal officials say. 
Customers who see child pornography online may complain to AOL. 
When an AOL screen name is identified in an FBI investigation, the 
database is checked to see if any complaints exist.

<HEADLINE> Farmers To Get $2B in Disaster Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers finally will get $2 billion in  
long-approved funds from the Agriculture Department to help ease 
their financial hardship. Checks will go in the mail next week, 
ending an eight-month delay that drew criticism from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This assistance should provide additional, needed relief to  
farmers still reeling from recent costly disasters,'' Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was included in a $6 billion farm bailout package  
passed by Congress in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman has said the huge package with several smaller aid  
programs took a long time to disburse. Parts of the plan, including 
$2.8 billion in payments to compensate for low prices, already have 
gone out to farmers. The Agriculture Department will begin mailing 
checks Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The disaster portion was more complicated because it covered  
farmers with crop losses over several years before 1998 or losses 
only in 1998 -- a provision that took an enormous amount of time to 
compile, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done it frankly as fast as we can,'' Glickman said.  
``This was a complicated program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers will be paid 84.9 percent of qualifying single-year or  
multiyear losses. No farmer could qualify for both; payments were 
made at the higher of the two levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The average payment is $7,000 while the maximum is $67,920.  
</P>
<P>
	Texas, which had a bad drought last year, probably is one of the  
biggest benefactors, Glickman said, although money is being 
disbursed in every state. State by state breakdowns are not yet 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Other areas likely to get large checks include the Dakotas,  
California, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Louisiana and 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money being paid out, about two-thirds, is for 1998  
losses. The rest is for multiyear losses.

	Rambis took over on an interim basis from Del Harris in February  
and, despite the Dennis Rodman fiasco, he led the Lakers past 
Houston in the first round of the NBA playoffs before losing four 
straight to San Antonio.

	The newspaper report, published Thursday, said no contract

Rambis and several -- led by a rousing endorsement from Kobe Bryant 
-- said they would fully support his return.

<HEADLINE> House Panel May Boost Airport Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the House Transportation  
Committee moved Thursday to put a dent in his own Republican 
party's tax cut plans with a proposal to increase airport spending 
by $14 billion through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee, by voice vote, approved Bud Shuster's revised  
plan to gradually increase Federal Aviation Administration spending 
from $9.7 billion this year to $15.4 billion in 2004. The annual 
increases would total $14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster, R-Pa., a fierce advocate of infrastructure spending,  
said all the extra spending would come from the Aviation Trust 
Fund, which holds revenues from airport user taxes. He would 
separate the fund from the general budget so that user taxes could 
not be used for non-aviation programs. 
</P>
<P>
	That move could seriously affect future budget considerations --  
the trust fund currently has a balance of $10 billion, and that is 
expected to rise to $91 billion over the next decade. But Shuster 
said it could be done without harming other federal programs if 
Republicans trimmed their plans for a $778 billion tax cut over the 
next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster said it was ``grossly unfair'' to use airport taxes to  
fund a general tax cut rather than for improvements in airport 
safety and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Shuster succeeded in isolating a similar highway trust  
fund from the general budget. Shuster's efforts have met strong 
opposition from the House and Senate appropriations committees, 
which see the budget changes as a loss of control over how federal 
dollars are spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like it's heating up and that's fine,'' Shuster said  
of his differences with the appropriators. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's proposal modified an FAA bill the committee approved  
in March that would have doubled aviation spending over five years. 
That proved too much to handle for the GOP leadership, which is 
trying to restrain spending while pushing a big general tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The new version, which is expected to reach the House floor in  
mid-June, was backed by the ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. 
James Oberstar of Minnesota. ``This is the best possible 
solution,'' he said. ``It will work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Transportation Department Secretary Rodney Slater, in a  
letter to Shuster Wednesday, said that while the administration 
supports the program goals of the bill, it opposes separating trust 
fund revenues from the general budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Building a firewall around airport taxes, he said, would  
``provide the FAA with a guaranteed funding stream without 
providing incentives to use those funds efficiently.'' Slater said 
he would be ``unable to recommend'' that the president sign the 
bill in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would increase the FAA's facilities budget by 50  
percent, take steps to increase service and competition at small 
airports and provide more money for new runways and air traffic 
controllers.

<HEADLINE> Here Comes Human Number Six Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chances are it will be a boy born in the Third  
World on Oct. 12, but no one will know exactly which child pushes 
the world's population to 6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	It took most of the age of humanity to mark the first billion in  
1804 and more than a century to mark the second. But now the world 
is adding a billion every dozen years or so. 
</P>
<P>
	Demographers believe growth will slow down, but the next billion  
could be added at another record pace, according to the Population 
Reference Bureau, which issued its 1999 World Population Data Sheet 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Researcher Carl Haub is already focusing on 7 billion and the  
debate over whether the next billion will come faster or slower 
than the last. 
</P>
<P>
	Median U.N. projections say it will take 14 years to add another  
billion people. Population projections, however, have become more 
complex than ever, with birth and death rates varying widely from 
region to region, the impact of AIDS, advances in population 
programs and longer life expectancies. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has decided the best estimate for the 6  
billionth living earthling's birthday is Oct. 12. That's calculated 
from the current rate of population increase of about 1.4 percent a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no plans to even attempt the virtually impossible task  
of pinpointing who the child will be or where he or she will be 
born, but it's likely to be in a Third World country in Africa or 
Asia because that's where most children are born. 
</P>
<P>
	And odds are, narrowly, that it will be a boy simply because  
there are 105 boys born for every 100 girls worldwide. The latest 
data show about 50.4 percent of the world's population is male, but 
in the industrialized world, 51.6 percent of the population is 
female. In the United States, women outnumber men 51-49. 
</P>
<P>
	That is because a variety of factors weigh in after birth,  
including higher infant death rates among males and the generally 
longer life expectancy for females in developed countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Haub said even a slight change in fertility or mortality now  
could make a huge difference in world population figures over the 
next century 
</P>
<P>
	``If we miss just a little bit on the projections, we could end  
up with 7 billion by the fastest rate ever,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The median projection that it will take two years longer to  
reach the next billion is based on the idea that fertility rates 
worldwide will drop to two children per woman. The current rate is 
2.9. 
</P>
<P>
	That is very optimistic, said Haub, even though demographers do  
not expect percentage population increases to spiral ever upward. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just gone through a demographic century that I don't  
think will ever be equaled,'' he said at a news conference 
releasing the data from the independent, non-advocacy research 
group. The report notes that world population in the 20th century 
increased by 4.4 billion, reflecting more than 300 percent growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Haub said population increases in the next century could  
accelerate in some countries, but the worldwide pattern will vary, 
with growth occurring almost exclusively in less developed 
countries. Industrialized nations, which doubled their population 
in the 20th century, will grow slowly or not at all, he said. 
Europe, in fact, is likely to lose population over the next 100 
years.

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes To Block Base Closings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ignoring Pentagon pleas, the Senate voted  
60-40 on Wednesday to block a round of cost-saving military base 
closings proposed for 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration argued the closures were needed to  
free up funds to help modernize a military stretched even thinner 
by the conflict in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans said they mistrusted the process, renewing  
allegations that President Clinton meddled in 1995 to save jobs at 
bases in vote-rich California and Texas. And Democratic support for 
another round was mixed, with Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., 
among the opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Wednesday, the Senate turned down, 77 to 21, a move by Sen.  
Bob Smith, R-N.H., to cut off funding for U.S. participation in the 
NATO military campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith told senators that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic  
``has accomplished what he wanted to accomplish,'' driving ethnic 
Albanians out of Kosovo. ``I don't know what we're achieving in 
continuing to bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate leaders of both parties said such a stark action  
would undercut NATO and U.S. troops in the region. Previous efforts 
in the Senate to either scale back or step up the military campaign 
have also been defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third year in a row that the administration's plan  
for additional base closings was rejected by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Barry Toiv called the Senate  
action ``a vote in favor of wasting defense resources that are 
needed to maintain our defense readiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In what also is becoming a perennial vote, the Senate rejected  
51-49 a move to lift a ban that prohibits abortions at military 
hospitals -- even if the woman pays for it herself. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors of ending the prohibition, Sens. Patty Murray,  
D-Wash., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, argued that the restriction 
put a heavy burden on military women stationed overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are asking a lot of these young women. We should at least  
allow them to pay for this procedure, in a military hospital, where 
it is safe,'' Murray said. Opponents argued that it still would 
amount to a partial federal subsidy. An identical attempt was 
rejected 49-44 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes came as the Senate inched toward passage of a $288.8  
billion defense spending bill for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill provides $8.3 billion more than Clinton asked for a  
variety of Pentagon programs for next year, including a 4.8 percent 
across-the-board military pay raise next Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The base closings vote rejected a move by Sens. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., and Carl Levin, D-Mich., to revive the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be ashamed, or a little ashamed. Find me one  
military expert who says we don't have to close bases,'' said 
McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., called the  
proposal ``one more stick in the eye that will adversely affect our 
military men and women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing could not be worse'' for additional base closings,  
Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen contends that closing antiquated  
bases -- many of them Cold War relics -- could save the Pentagon 
nearly $4 billion a year that would be better spent on aircraft 
carriers, jet fighters and other crucial hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress has always been reluctant to close bases, and is  
still smarting from previous rounds, in 1991, 1993 and 1995, that 
closed 70 bases and depots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not seen the kind of savings that were promised,''  
said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. She said that in the 1995 round, 
``California got hit so hard, I couldn't even begin to tell you. We 
still have bases sitting there that haven't been cleaned up and 
cannot be reused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's proposal for two new rounds of base  
closings -- one in 2001 and another in 2005 -- was rejected this 
month by the Armed Services panel. McCain and Levin had sought to 
win approval for just one round. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., contended  
it was impossible to create a truly nonpartisan process for base 
closings, particularly while Clinton remains in office. The 
existing process calls for Congress to authorize a round of 
closings, then for the independent Base Realignment and Closure 
Commission to select the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans contend Clinton poisoned the process to save  
jobs at McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento, Calif., and Kelly 
Air Force Base in San Antonio, both targets of a 1995 round. ``The 
sticky fingerprints of politics got in there,'' Warner said. The 
administration denies doing anything illegal as it tried to find 
private-sector jobs for base workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv, the White House spokesman, said Wednesday that the Defense  
Department calculates that the steps taken at McClellan and Kelly 
``has already saved taxpayers $200 million and will save $2.6 
billion over the next 15 years.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Warfield Introduction Worth $629,529 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A jury has decided that an introduction to  
pro football Hall of Famer Paul Warfield is worth at least 
$629,529. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal court jury on Wednesday awarded that amount to  
businessman Richard Rentz, who said his introduction of Warfield to 
two Miami, Fla., businessmen led to a lucrative license to design, 
manufacture and distribute NFL athletic sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
	Warfield, who played for the Cleveland Browns and Miami Dolphins  
in the 1960s and 1970s, was dismissed as a defendant in Rentz's 
civil lawsuit before the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Rentz, of nearby Washington Township, said that in exchange for  
introducing Armando Mendez and Ignacio Mendez to Warfield, Rentz 
received an oral contract that called for him to receive 1 percent 
of the gross sales of their company, Dynasty Apparel Industries 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Those sales have exceeded $62.9 million since Rentz made the  
introduction at a baseball game in Cincinnati in the fall of 1990, 
according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury also found that Rentz is to continue to receive 1  
percent of Dynasty's gross sales as long as the company and 
Warfield remain in their joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Dynasty's attorney, Jeffrey Cox, told the jury Rentz had no  
contract or understanding with Dynasty or the Mendez brothers to 
receive 1 percent of Dynasty's gross sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a very expensive introduction,'' Cox said.

<HEADLINE> Racing Needs More Than Luck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A brilliant piece of marketing, Tim Smith was told -- having a  
horse bid for the Triple Crown twice in the first 14 months of the 
National Thoroughbred Racing Association's existence. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTRA commissioner laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's dumb luck,'' he said. ``Sometimes it's more important  
to be lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luck always has been a major player in horse racing on the track  
and at the mutuel windows. Unfortunately, it seems it has had a lot 
to do with the operation of the sport, where cooperation often has 
been an also-ran. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the purpose of the NTRA -- get some cooperation among the  
various tracks and racing interest groups to boost the sport 
through marketing 
</P>
<P>
	``What our mission is, is to improve the economic conditions in  
the industry,'' said Smith of the organization that opened for 
business April 1 with the financial backing of five founding 
members -- the Jockey Club. Breeders Cup Ltd., Keeneland 
Association, Oak Tree Racing Association and National Thoroughbred 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been no major complaints,'' Smith said. ``Part of  
what the industry learned in the first year is you can accomplish 
more working together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everybody, however, has been happy about everything the NTRA  
has done or is trying to do. That of course is natural in a 
business as competitive as horse racing. Bettors aren't the only 
ones looking for an edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, it seems that the people who operate race tracks have  
long been more attuned to the swashbuckling ways of boxing than to 
the corporate structure of professional team sports. 
</P>
<P>
	In this age of casino gambling, state lotteries and ferocious  
competition for the leisure-time dollar, people in racing have 
little choice but to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're off to a good start,'' Smith said. `A lot more remains  
to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of things the NTRA has accomplished are launch a new,  
national brand for thoroughbred racing, start national and co-op 
advertising campaigns and significantly increase racing's profile 
on national television. 
</P>
<P>
	There are always huge crowds at the Kentucky Derby and  
Preakness, and there will be one at Belmont Park on June 5 when 
Charismatic will try to win the Belmont Stakes and Triple Crown. 
Adding spice to the proceedings will the presence of sensational 
filly Silverbulletday. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance, however, on a daily basis nationally can no longer  
rival what it used to be when betting on horses was sports betting. 
But you no longer have to go to the track to bet. In fact, in an 
increasing number of places you don't even have to leave home to 
bet. This is an area in which the NTRA is concentrating. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTRA realizes that it's important to get new people  
interested enough in racing to visit a track. If he or she gets 
interested enough to bet on a fairly regular basis, it doesn't 
matter if the wager is made on or off track. 
</P>
<P>
	So advertising and racing on television are important.  
</P>
<P>
	``We doubled the number of hours on broadcast television, and  
there's been a healthy increase on cable TV as well,'' Smith said. 
``The more racing on television, the more general fan interest is 
created.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Initiated this year was the ``NTRA Champions on Fox Series,''  
which hasn't pleased everyone in racing. But, Smith said, the 
series format is not chiseled in stone, that changes can be made. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's nonstop televising of racing and racing information  
that is the NTRA's goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the cost of $300 million over the next three or four years,  
we're committed to establishing and launching a basic cable network 
over 24 years to 30 million homes,'' Smith said. ``The likelihood 
is that only a fraction of those homes would open up a (wagering) 
account. But only a small percentage would be a big number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NTRA definitely can be winner, if those involved in racing  
ride it to the wire.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Hear Diverse Gun Views </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two parents whose children were slain by  
classmates gave lawmakers diverse views Thursday on whether the 
slayers, guns or lawmakers themselves are to blame for their 
tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Scott of Littleton, Colo., told the House Judiciary  
Committee's subcommittee that he blames the April 20 death of his 
daughter, Rachel Joy Scott, 17, on Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people behind those instruments of death,'' Scott  
told the panel. ``I do believe Eric and Dylan bear primary 
responsibility for my daughter's death, not the guns themselves.'' 
.
</P>
<P>
	But Byrl Phillips-Taylor of Richmond, Va., placed the blamed an  
AK47 for her son's 1989 death at the hands of a ``classmate with a 
grudge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The easy availability of guns got my baby killed,''  
Phillips-Taylor told the panel, urging lawmakers to pass the 
mandatory background checks for gun show transactions and other new 
firearms restrictions voted by the Senate last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate has demonstrated that it cares about keeping guns  
away from children,'' she said. ``And that may be the turning point 
that every mother like me has been waiting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders this week said they support the concept  
of the gun restrictions passed by the Senate, but they rejected 
demands from Democrats to quickly rubber-stamp the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, who has co-authored gun  
control bills in the past, said careful consideration of the 
legislation next month would ensure that new controls would not 
infringe on the Second Amendment right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans at Thursday's hearing criticized the Clinton  
administration as failing to prosecute violators of existing 
firearms laws while pushing for more gun restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., suggested that if the Ten Commandments had  
been posted at high schools where the shooting occurred, ``we would 
not have had the tragedies that bring us here today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Replied Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr.: ``If the young  
people and adult criminals who committed these crimes had a tougher 
time getting their hands on guns, these horrible crimes might have 
been prevented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, who broke a 50-50 Senate tie last week  
in favor of the new gun show restrictions, returned to the Capitol 
Thursday to accuse House Republicans of trying to please the 
National Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this very moment, there are some of the other side meeting  
behind closed doors plotting to have more delays in order to 
preserve loopholes'' in firearms law, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre told the House  
subcommittee Thursday that the Senate bill was a ``red tape 
nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically it would extend the reaches of the federal  
government into the homes of this country,'' LaPierre said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the NRA supports mandatory gun show background checks  
and other concepts in the Senate bill, but not as written. For 
example, he said, the Senate would ``your uncle's skeet-shooting 
range'' as a gun show subject to government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, testifying at the request of committee Republicans,  
supported LaPierre's complaint that some gun control advocates were 
seeking to put the blame for the shootings at the NRA's doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that they are responsible for my daughter's  
death,'' said Scott, who said he was not a member of the group and 
does not own a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott also scolded lawmakers about their eagerness to pass more  
laws despite the cultural causes behind school shootings. 
``Political posturing and restrictive legislation are not the 
answers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Charity Replaces Chief Amid Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Feed The Children has replaced the  
director of its Nashville distribution center amid an investigation 
into whether he and other employees stole donations to the 
worldwide charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Highfill and about six other administrative employees of  
the relief agency were videotaped by WTVF-TV taking boxes of 
donated goods from the charity's warehouse. Highfill told the 
station he saw nothing wrong with allowing administrative staff to 
take donated items. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation raided the  
employees' homes Monday. They carried out boxes and bags of 
brand-name clothing -- some with tags still on -- shoes, videos, 
blankets, food and other goods they suspect were donated for poor 
people. One box had ``Merry Christmas to me'' written on the top. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Larry Jones, president and founder of the relief  
agency, said Highfill was being replaced by Jones' longtime friend 
and colleague Don Richardson while Tennessee authorities and his 
own staff investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones would not say whether Highfill or any other Nashville  
employees had been suspended or fired. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no answer at Highfill's home on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Nashville is home to one of the Oklahoma City-based charity's  
two U.S. distribution centers. Jones said it was unclear how much 
may have been taken from the warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The charity receives about $150 million in cash every year and  
$150 million worth of donated goods, but Jones could not say how 
much of that goes through Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	WTVF reported Thursday that warehouse workers apparently were  
ignored in December and January when they called Feed The 
Children's headquarters to report that Highfill and others were 
taking donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope our investigation brings that out because that's new to  
me,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers told WTVF that they saw recently employees take  
boxes meant for Kosovar refugees and Oklahoma City tornado victims. 
</P>

	Jones said he would look into the possibility some of the  
donations were taken legitimately -- that workers were bringing 
clothing home to clean it or taking goods to needy people who could 
not get to the warehouse.

<HEADLINE> GM Recalls Some Cadillac Sevilles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. is recalling about 35,000  
Cadillac Sevilles from model year 1999 and about 139 from 1998 
because electrical shorts in the generator may cause an engine 
compartment fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Fires have occurred even with the engine off and the key  
removed, GM said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been seven confirmed reports of fires, none of which  
have resulted in injuries, GM said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want our customers to know that we consider this a serious  
condition,'' said John Smith, Cadillac general manager. ``We have 
started the process of contacting customers so that they can have 
their vehicles serviced as soon as possible at their Cadillac 
dealer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recall covers the 1998 vehicles built in August 1998, and  
have vehicle identification numbers greater than WU934376. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicles should not be parked in an enclosed area, like a  
garage, until they are brought into a dealership, GM said.

<HEADLINE> Youngest Pacer Not on Playoff Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indiana Pacers welcomed teen-ager Al  
Harrington with affection, taught him, adopted him as one of the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	When the regular season ended, though, the first-round draft  
pick out of high school was not even included on their playoff 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew why.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was an up and down season for me,'' the 6-foot-9 forward  
said Wednesday after practice. ``When I first came in I expected to 
play a lot, but we've got a veteran ball club and their goal is to 
win a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I realized I wasn't going to play as much as I planned on,  
but I learned a lot this year, sitting and watching these guys 
play,'' he said. ``They're true champions, even though they don't 
have the ring yet. They know what it takes to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers open the best-of-7 Eastern Conference championships  
against the New York Knicks on Sunday. It's the fourth time in six 
years Indiana has reached the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington played in 21 games during the regular season,  
averaging 2.1 points and 1.9 rebounds. He was a fan favorite from 
his very first appearance in a preseason scrimmage, when he took 
the public address microphone and sang the ``Barney'' theme song as 
part of a rookie initiation. 
</P>
<P>
	He played fewer than eight minutes a game, showing veteran moves  
at times but rookie mistakes at others. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a difficult year for him,'' coach Larry Bird said. ``It  
was a shortened season (because of the lockout) and he came in and 
didn't know what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played every other night and really didn't get a lot of  
practice time, so Al's got a long way to go, there's no question 
about that,'' Bird said. ``But if he works hard in the summer and 
comes back with a fresh mind and really remembers what we try to 
teach him, hopefully he can get off to a better start and then 
maybe get in there and play a little more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the first-round series with Milwaukee, the Pacers  
activated veteran Fred Hoiberg from the injured list in place of 
Harrington. Mark Pope and Mate Skelin, on the injured list most of 
the season, also are continuing to practice during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was difficult in the beginning, but I'm over that now,''  
Harrington said. ``It was a business decision, and I have to deal 
with it and do whatever I can to make sure it never happens 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington, 19, was the 25th pick in the draft, out of St.  
Patrick's High School in Elizabeth, N.J. He came to Indianapolis 
last summer and lived with veteran forward Antonio Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned a lot from Antonio, a lot of life things,''  
Harrington said. ``I learned a lot from guys like Sam Perkins. I 
hang out with him a lot. All these guys have been very beneficial 
to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So while his veteran teammates prepare for the Knicks,  
Harrington still is practicing, working on his game, getting a jump 
start on next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to work regardless. It's only my first season,'' he  
said. ``If I stay healthy, I could play 20 years. This is only one 
year.''

</P>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Holly Caudill, believed to be the first female  
quadriplegic attorney in the United States, died Friday after 
surgery for a life-threatening infection. She was 36. 
</P>
<P>
	Her heart failed as she was being wheeled into the recovery  
room, a friend told The San Diego Union-Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Caudill, who lobbied for legislation to help the working  
disabled, served since 1997 in the U.S. Attorney's Office in San 
Diego. She was assigned to the border-crime unit as a special 
assistant U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Paralyzed from the neck down after a car accident at age 14, Ms.  
Caudill began her legal career in 1995 with the U.S. District Court 
in the Eastern District of Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at her alma mater, Gonzaga University, said her career  
marked the first time a quadriplegic woman had become a lawyer in 
the United States, said Debra Hartman, spokeswoman for the San 
Diego U.S. Attorney's office.

	PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Edith Lewin, an arts patron who with  
her husband donated $25 million worth of 20th century Mexican art 
to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, died Sunday of cancer. She 
was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewin gift to the museum in 1997 was the largest privately  
owned collection of modern Mexican art ever assembled, with about 
1,800 paintings and works on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection included the works of Rufino Tamayo, David  
Siqueiros, Jose Clemente Orozco, Carlos Merida, Rafael Coronel, 
Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewins operated an art gallery in Palm Springs before they  
donated their collection and retired.

</P>
<P>
	HYANNIS, Mass. (AP) -- The Rev. Kenneth B. Murphy, who gained  
national attention for his efforts to prevent suicides, died 
Saturday after a long illness. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy founded the Rescue Inc. suicide hotline when he was  
assistant pastor at St. Francis de Sales Church in Boston's 
Charlestown section. In a 1961 Saturday Evening Post article, he 
said the idea came to him in 1959 after he got a call from a 
17-year-old parishioner who threatened to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy eventually talked the teen out of suicide, and Boston  
police called on Murphy over the next several weeks to talk two 
young men from jumping to their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency operated for about 10 years. In a 1963 annual report,  
Murphy reported he'd received calls from 3,189 people, two of whom 
killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy assisted at parishes in Weymouth, Charlestown and Lowell.  
He was head pastor of St. Vincent de Paul Church in South Boston 
until 1973, when he became pastor at Holy Name Church in the West 
Roxbury neighborhood, where he'd served as an altar boy in his 
youth. He retired in 1996.

power, urban renewal and developing ocean resources, died Wednesday 
from a brain tumor. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Perazich, in a career that spanned 50 years, conducted studies  
under the auspices of the Works Progress Administration, the 
National Bureau of Economic Research, the National Planning 
Association and the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	He was director of industrial rehabilitation for the U.N. Relief  
and Works Agency from 1944 to 1947.

<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss billionaire industrialist and  
symphony conductor Paul Sacher died Wednesday after a long illness, 
the pharmaceutical giant Roche announced. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacher, reportedly one of the world's richest men, and other  
family members controlled Roche Holding AG, and had a joint fortune 
estimated at $17 billion to $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	He used his wealth to become one of the world's most influential  
arts patrons and inspiration to contemporary composers. Benjamin 
Britten, Richard Strauss, Igor Stravinsky and Bela Bartok were all 
proteges of Sacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacher first started playing the violin at age 6. He was  
educated at the Conservatoire of Basel, giving extra lessons to 
younger pupils to finance his passion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacher's life changed in 1934 with his marriage to Maja  
Hoffmann-Stehlin, a sculptor and recent widow of one of the 
founders of pharmaceutical giant Hoffmann-La Roche. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, he set up the Paul Sacher Foundation -- housing  
priceless manuscripts and letters from dozens of composers -- in a 
16th century building in the shadow of Basel cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacher conducted concerts throughout Europe, although he rarely  
visited the United States.

</P>
<P>
	Semon worked for the Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co., where one of  
his first assignments was make a rubber adhesive from polyvinyl 
chloride. Instead, he found a way to make PVC into a flexible, 
elastic material that became widely used in the plastic industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Semon earned 116 U.S. patents by the time he retired in 1963,  
including one for bubble gum. In 1995, Semon was inducted into the 
National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron.

<HEADLINE> IRL Reducing Speeds for Texas Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Taking another step to improve safety  
following a crash that killed three fans, the Indy Racing League 
announced today it will reduce speeds for the June 12 race at Texas 
Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Mehl, the IRL's executive director, said engines will be  
required to operate at no more than 10,000 rpms after Sunday's Indy 
500. The new specifications, which reduce the cars' horsepower, 
will be used for the remaining seven IRL events, beginning with the 
Longhorn 500. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL already reduced rpms from 10,500 to 10,300 at the  
beginning of this season. Mehl said he expected the change to 
reduce the top speeds at Texas to about 220 mph, a reduction of 4-5 
mph from last year's speeds at the 1.5-mile track. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the incident at Charlotte, we need to try to contain the  
speeds as much as we can,'' Mehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three fans died and eight were injured when debris sailed into  
the stands during a wreck at the May 1 Visionaire 500 at Lowe's 
Motor Speedway in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas track and Lowe's are almost identical high-banked  
ovals. Indianapolis Motor Speedway is much flatter, so the risk of 
debris flying into the stands is not as great. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the IRL announced a new safety system that  
uses cables in cars in an attempt to prevent wheels and suspension 
parts from reaching the stands during wrecks.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Wants MD-11 Autopilot Modified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety panel wants the autopilot  
system in the Boeing MD-11 jetliner modified to prevent severe 
reactions when pilots try to make flight course changes while the 
system is engaged. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration, Jim Hall,  
chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board Chairman, said 
overreactions caused severe pitching during two incidents in 1996 
and 1997, seriously injuring four passengers and a flight 
attendant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing Co., which assumed the MD-11 aircraft when it bought  
McDonnell Douglas in 1997, has warned of the potential problem in 
flight crew operating manuals. But the safety board wants the FAA 
to order that Boeing place the warning in its agency-approved 
Airplane Flight Manual and that all MD-11 operators place the 
warning in their corporate aircraft operating manuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said Boeing should also modify the autopilot to prevent  
upsets when manual control inputs are made while the automatic 
flight system is engaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The accidents raise concerns about the warning information and  
training provided to MD-11 pilots regarding proper use of the 
autopilot system that the Federal Aviation Administration should 
address,'' Hall wrote Tuesday in a formal safety recommendation to 
FAA Administrator Jane Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokesman Les Dorr said: ``We just got the recommendations  
and as always we'll be considering them very carefully.'' The 
agency usually follows the recommendations of the safety board. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokeswoman Lori Gunter said company manuals already warn  
of the problem in bold, capitalized letters. 
</P>
<P>
	She said redesigning the autopilot system ``is not as simple as  
it sounds,'' and pilots would be best served by following the 
established procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that we won't look into that -- we will -- but the  
systems are very complex,'' Gunter said. ``I should also point out 
that the autopilots in most other airplanes operate the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The MD-11 is a three-engine wide-body jet that is the upgrade  
for the widely used McDonnell Douglas DC-10. A Swissair MD-11 
crashed off the coast of Nova Scotia last year, killing all 229 
aboard, but there is no indication that accident was caused by an 
autopilot problem. In that case, the pilots had reported smoke in 
the cockpit 16 minutes before they crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the incidents that concerned the safety board occurred on  
July 13, 1996, as an American Airlines MD-11 flew over Westerly, 
R.I., from London to Kennedy Airport in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	While the plane descended with its autopilot engaged, the  
captain became concerned it would not level off at its assigned 
altitude. The first officer adjusted a pitch wheel, which did not 
stop the descent, so the captain pulled back on the control stick. 
</P>
<P>
	The airplane experienced an immediate upward pitch of 2.3 times  
the weight of gravity. Several oscillations followed. One passenger 
was seriously injured and one passenger and two flight attendants 
received minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The second incident occurred June 8, 1997, as a Japan Airlines  
MD-11 flew near Nagoya, Japan, on a flight from Hong Kong to 
Nagoya. 
</P>
<P>
	As the plane descended with the autopilot engaged, the captain  
became concerned that it would exceed its maximum operating speed. 
He grabbed the control stick and pulled back, triggering a series 
of pitch changes that ranged from adding 2.78 times the weight of 
gravity to reducing it by one-half the weight of gravity. 
</P>
<P>
	Three passengers and a flight attendant were seriously injured.

<HEADLINE> Pride Goeth Before a Fall Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``I'm po', but I'm proud.''  
</P>
<P>
	In years past, that was the catch phrase circulated by a chain  
of country-style restaurants. More recently, it's a creed the 
broadcast networks have embraced as their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Their audience continues to dwindle ... yet they insist they  
have a lock on the programming America wants ... even as they 
lament rising costs and plunging revenues ... despite robust ad 
sales ... while they persist in turning a buck wherever they can, 
pride be damned. The audience, too. 
</P>
<P>
	But pride goeth before a fall season. So however impoverished  
the networks may be feeling, at their ``upfront presentations'' for 
advertisers last week their claims for next season were, well, 
rich. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year at this time I tell you I'm excited,'' said one  
exec at ABC's upfront. ``This time, I'm really excited!'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS President Leslie Moonves boasted a new ``bimodal'' strategy  
(nothing to fret over, Rev. Wildmon) to woo younger adults without 
alienating the network's older audience base. 
</P>
<P>
	And trumpeting his network's schedule as ``quality, smart,  
fun,'' NBC West Coast President Scott Sassa promised advertisers a 
premium demographic: ``If you were trying to reach a 25-year-old 
college-educated woman, only Bill Clinton could do it better!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even someone with Clinton's mastery of detail would be hard  
pressed to master next season's interchangeable titles. MSNBC's 
``Time &AMP; Again'' will be joined by ABC's ``Once and Again'' and 
CBS' ``Now &AMP; Again.'' CBS already has ``Touched by an Angel'' and 
will add ``City of Angels,'' while the WB launches ``Angel'' and 
Fox premieres ``Dark Angel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the titles only seem recycled. Certain series actually are.  
</P>
<P>
	A spinoff of NBC's long-running ``Law &AMP; Order,'' the new ``Law &AMP;  
Order: Special Victims Unit'' will air on NBC each Monday, then on 
cable's USA network a few days later with the same episode. Let 
NBC's Sassa dismiss cable as ``not in the same game'' with 
broadcast. This money-saving deal makes clear that not only are 
broadcast and cable in the same game, they sometimes play on the 
same team. 
</P>
<P>
	In an even more brazen repurposing tack, Fox will launch a  
variation on the ``Ally McBeal'' theme. ``Ally'' Lite will 
alchemize old, unused and fresh footage into a half-hour format 
that steers clear of lawyerly pursuits to dwell on the comedy in 
Ally's world. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the idea of David E. Kelley, who created the original  
``Ally McBeal'' hour and a host of other series. He's a brilliant 
writer and, in his hands, ``Ally'' Junior might excel artistically, 
not just give Fox a ``new'' show on the cheap. 
</P>
<P>
	But if it clicks, brace yourself for a rash of series alter  
egos. Imagine ``X-Files: The Sitcom.'' Or ``drewsomething,'' a 
relationship drama starring Drew Carey as a sensitive male in 
search of love and understanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever happens, you can bet the networks will own a piece. The  
prevailing programming trend isn't drama, animation or anything 
with teens. It's the networks' increased stake in the series they 
opt to put on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, CBS is listed as a producer of all six of its fall  
series. Could that have played any role in CBS' scheduling those 
shows, rather than other contenders in which the network would have 
had no financial interest? 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Four networks, which own all or part of more than half  
of the fall prime-time schedule, explain they're only protecting 
themselves. NBC owned not so much as a bedpan from its hit series 
``ER'' when, in January 1998, the show's producers jacked the 
per-episode price to an unprecedented $13 million. NBC had no 
choice but to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, some observers felt that NBC gave away the store by  
agreeing to such a colossal sum. Not true. NBC still owns a store 
in the heart of Manhattan and, in fact, recently expanded it. 
</P>
<P>
	The store is now proudly billed as the NBC Experience -- a  
somewhat grandiose use of the term and presumably not what Jimi 
Hendrix had in mind. But there you can experience paying $12 for a 
``Profiler'' thermal mug or $28 for an ``ER'' scrub top. You can 
wash down your experience with NBC brand Bottled Water for $1.90 
the half-liter. Turn on, tune in, drop a bundle! 
</P>
<P>
	Then come fall, new shows on NBC's airwaves means new tchotchkes  
on its shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Is that what TV has come to? Po' viewers.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	HI-DEF FOOTBALL: The coming season of ``Monday Night Football''  
will be broadcast live in high-definition television, ABC has 
announced. In partnership with Panasonic Broadcast &AMP; Television 
Systems Co., the network will also air Super Bowl XXXIV in HDTV 
from Atlanta on Jan. 20. The HDTV telecasts will be produced and 
transmitted independently of ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' on the 
traditional analog network and represent the first live, regularly 
scheduled HDTV sports event in prime time. To make the HDTV 
broadcasts possible, Panasonic will build and outfit a 720P HDTV 
mobile production truck, which will travel to all 17 ``Monday Night 
Football'' games, one wild-card playoff game and the Super Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Gucci Wins Court Battle With LVMH </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- A Dutch court ruled Thursday in  
favor of Italian fashion house Gucci and against the French company 
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton which is waging a hostile takeover 
battle for Gucci. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amsterdam District Court rejected a demand by LVMH that  
Gucci's strategic alliance with French retailer 
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute be annulled. 
</P>
<P>
	It also rejected LVMH's call for an investigation into Gucci's  
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci Chairman Domenico de Sole said he was ``very pleased''  
with the decision. ``We will now move forward to implement our 
alliance with PPR,'' De Sole said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court did rule in LVMH's favor, however, by ordering Gucci  
abandon its employee stock option plan set up earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH made an offer for Gucci in March but asked the court in a  
lawsuit filed in April to overturn measures taken by Gucci to avoid 
the bid, including issuing new shares to PPR. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, in a written statement earlier this month, banned the  
Italian group from investing $2.9 billion in proceeds from the sale 
of the 40 percent stake to PPR. 
</P>
<P>
	PPR's purchase of the 40 percent stake effectively diluted the  
34 percent stake LVMH already had in Gucci to around 20 percent and 
reduced its voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci has said the sale was needed to fend off LVMH's ``creeping  
takeover.'' It will hold its annual shareholders' meeting after the 
court's ruling.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Names Campaign Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes  
has chosen Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell to be national 
chairman of his 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwell, one of the party's leading black elected officials,  
will be a top spokesman and strategist for politics and policy, 
Forbes said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an individual of true principle. He understands the  
principles of my campaign,'' Forbes said. ``Whether the issue is 
taxation or school opportunity, we've been on the same page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the joint interview, Blackwell said he believes Forbes is the  
only candidate who can inspire hope, create opportunity and include 
minorities in his political coalition. ``Steve has always been an 
advocate for the politics of inclusion,'' Blackwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwell, 51, was elected secretary of state in November after  
serving as Ohio's treasurer. He considered running for governor, 
but was persuaded by party leaders to keep the primary clear for 
Bob Taft, who went on to win the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwell was regional chairman of Jack Kemp's 1988 Republican  
presidential campaign and also was county chairman for the 
presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan and George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite limited national experience -- he served as an  
undersecretary of Housing and Urban Development and ambassador to 
the U.N. Human Rights Commission in the Bush administration -- 
Blackwell gives Forbes an inroad in Ohio, one of the battleground 
states of the presidential campaign. He also is one of the highest 
ranking minorities in any presidential campaign, Democratic or 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who campaigned for Blackwell in 1998, said the new  
chairman was one of the few GOP leaders who fought against a 
proposed sales tax increase in Ohio. ``We've been on the same song 
sheet for a number of years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwell is married with three children.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Scorers Remain Silent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Derian Hatcher, a rugged defenseman with stubble  
that would demand a sharp razor, has drawn the arduous task of 
shadowing high-scoring, hard-hitting center Peter Forsberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The early results couldn't be better for the Dallas Stars, who  
have effectively contained Forsberg and Colorado's potent offense 
to take a 2-1 series lead over the Avalanche in the Western 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether I wanted the assignment or not, I got it,'' Hatcher  
said Thursday. ``I would rather play against the other lines. ... 
He is one of the harder guys in the league to defend. He is so 
strong on his skates. You can't knock him down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher's work in Dallas' 3-0 victory Wednesday night followed  
two games of grinding by teammate Guy Carbonneau, who actually 
asked to go head-to-head with Forsberg in the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Avalanche have the last line change at home,  
Carbonneau was not able to match up on Forsberg, leaving the task 
to Hatcher. The assignment will be the same for Game 4 Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God we've got a guy like Derian on our team,'' Dallas  
center Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``He's a big strong guy, too. You can 
only try to contain Forsberg. You're not going stop him all the 
time. He's just too good for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forsberg, who leads all playoff scorers with 20 points, had a  
goal and an assist in Game 1, but has been held to one assist in 
the last two games -- both Colorado losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of recent scoring punch from Forsberg and captain Joe  
Sakic prompted Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy to issue some tough 
love after Wednesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, never one to mince words, said Nieuwendyk and Mike Modano  
were simply outplaying Forsberg and Sakic. Sakic, who scored 39 
goals in the regular season, has just one in Colorado's last 10 
playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's right on,'' Sakic said when told of Roy's comment. ``It's  
not that we're not working hard, but we're not scoring. I know my 
role, and I have to put the puck in the net for us to be 
successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's just the start for the Avalanche, who turned the puck  
over 23 times in Game 3 and rarely challenged Dallas goaltender Ed 
Belfour on rebounds in front of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Eddie had a very easy game in Game 3,'' Roy said.  
``He could have sat in a chair. I think we have to make it tougher 
on him like they did on me in Game 2 and Game 3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's impossible to predict how the Avalanche will respond to  
being shut out at home for the second time in the playoffs. The 
last time it happened, they rebounded to win four straight against 
defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have the ability to do that,'' said Dallas defenseman  
Shawn Chambers. ``They have so many talented players. They have 
three lines of straight talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's unpredictable temperament is enough to keep Stars  
coach Ken Hitchcock from daydreaming about finally reaching the 
Stanley Cup finals after 19 years of coaching junior hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think either team has control of anything right now,''  
Hitchcock said. ``We certainly as a group don't feel we have 
control of any momentum other than we gained home ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even home ice means nothing to the Avalanche, 7-1 on the road in  
the playoffs and 2-5 at home. They were booed regularly by the home 
crowd Wednesday and skated off to a near-empty McNichols Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the position we hoped to be in, but we're just a win  
away from tying the series,'' Roy said. ``We all understand the 
importance of (Friday's) game. We have to come up with our biggest 
home game of the season.''

<HEADLINE> Sluggers McGwire, Sosa Meet Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- When they see each other, Mark McGwire and Sammy  
Sosa might talk golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Or they might discuss side dishes for Sosa's planned Chicago  
restaurant. Sammy's Salami? Mark's Mashed Taters? Long-ball 
Linguine? 
</P>
<P>
	For everyone else in Wrigley Field, though, seeing the towering  
figure in Cardinals red and the compact, muscular man in Cubs blue 
side-by-side will stir memories. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men from vastly different backgrounds, linked forever by  
baseball's greatest home run race, still command attention in the 
second month of a new season, even though neither is a home run 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great rivalry and always fun to play at Wrigley Field.  
But the focus should be on the Cards and Cubs, not McGwire and 
Sosa,'' McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fat chance.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Sosa's 66 homers didn't quite measure up. McGwire  
pulled away on the final weekend of the season, and his astounding 
70 homers may never be touched. 
</P>
<P>
	``The race was last year,'' Sosa said. ``Everybody knows what  
happened last year. We don't know what will happen this year, but 
to talk about it is too early. We still have another four months to 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, McGwire hit No. 14 for the year to share the Cards'  
team lead with Fernando Tatis. He has homered six times in the last 
eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, meanwhile, had 12 homers in his last 21 games and 16 this  
season before the Cubs got a day off Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Sosa and McGwire are trailing the likes of Ken Griffey  
Jr., Jose Canseco and Raul Mondesi, who's to say they can't catch 
up? 
</P>
<P>
	``We can have 10 or 12 home runs and then, in another 10-15  
days, we can hit 10-15 more home runs. That's just the way we 
are,'' Sosa said, perhaps recalling that his major league-record 20 
homers last June got him into the home run race. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Cubs and Cards last met, in September at Busch Stadium,  
McGwire tied Roger Maris, then passed him with the historic No. 62 
the next night off Chicago's Steve Trachsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa ran in from right field to congratulate his respected  
rival, and they exchanged their familiar greetings -- McGwire's fake 
punch to the stomach, Sosa's two-finger salute to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa took the lead briefly on Sept. 25 with his 66th, but  
McGwire answered with his 66th the same night. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa led McGwire one other time, last Aug. 19 at Wrigley. Sosa's  
lead lasted about an hour; he hit his 48th before McGwire responded 
with two later in the same game to lead 49-48. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how they pushed one another, making what they  
accomplished seem more human, appealing even to people who didn't 
count themselves as baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They created thousands of new fans, hundreds of thousands of  
new fans really, around the country, gave them something to really 
latch on,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So a lot of people who were not fans of the game at all  
watched and a lot of people who had left the game because of the 
strike came back. They would probably have gotten back eventually, 
but Mark and Sammy certainly speeded it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrigley Field is sold out this weekend, but Sosa and McGwire  
don't get all of the credit. The Cardinals and Cubs are one of the 
enduring matchups in the National League; thousands of St. Louis 
fans make the five-hour drive to Chicago, dotting the Wrigley seats 
and bleachers with their familiar red. 
</P>
<P>
	Now there are two more reasons to come.  
</P>
<P>
	``To have them both in the same ball park, that's special,'' St.  
Louis manager Tony LaRussa said. ``But their homers didn't make 
this series. The Cards and the Cubs were there a long time before 
Sammy and Mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa would have you believe he'll be as low-key as McGwire  
predicts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to shaking his hand and going about my  
job,'' Sosa said. ``It will be the first time we play against each 
other and everybody is excited, you know. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's my friend. We're friends. That's it.''

	War Crimes Panel Indicts Milosevic  
</P>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- In a historic announcement, an  
international tribunal today indicted Slobodan Milosevic and four 
powerful aides, calling the Yugoslav president personally 
responsible for planning and carrying out a gruesome campaign of 
war crimes in Kosovo. It was the first time an international court 
has charged a sitting head of state with such crimes and 
atrocities. In Belgrade, a government minister was immediately 
defiant, saying Yugoslav authorities would not recognize the 
jurisdiction of the U.N. war crimes tribunal. 

</P>
<P>
	Albright: No Immunity for Milosevic  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said  
today there is no possibility of an immunity deal for Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to achieve peace in Kosovo. Albright 
said that the indicted Milosevic must be taken to the Hague for 
trial on war-crimes charges. ``He has to be turned over,'' she 
said. Albright said the indictment would have no impact on NATO's 
air campaign, humanitarian efforts or diplomatic moves to solve the 
Kosovo crisis.

two aircraft but said only one was shot down. Earlier, Indian 
helicopter gunships fired rockets at Kashmir's mountains for a 
second day -- the first time the two rivals have used air power in 
Kashmir since India's 1971 war with Pakistan. India says it is 
trying to push out hundreds of Pakistan-backed guerrillas who have 
infiltrated Indian-held Kashmir near the unofficial border.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno today criticized  
aides for not asking her whether to wiretap a nuclear weapons 
scientist suspected of spying for China. The Senate, meanwhile, 
voted to expand congressional oversight over technology exports. 
The Senate approved a bipartisan package of measures designed to 
tighten controls on technology exports, require the administration 
to keep Congress better informed of Chinese satellite launches and 
to beef up security at U.S. weapons labs. But efforts to act on a 
more extensive series of measures in the House was put off until 
next month.

``I will resign from the Knesset but in no way will I resign from

<HEADLINE> Lakers May Want Rambis As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers are leaning strongly  
toward hiring Kurt Rambis as permanent coach, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that several  
unidentified sources close to the situation said key Laker 
executives favor the selection of Rambis, who took over on an 
interim basis from Del Harris in February. 
</P>
<P>
	No contract negotiations have begun and team executive vice  
president Jerry West and general manager Mitch Kupchak have yet to 
formally present Rambis as their choice to owner Jerry Buss, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers spokesman John Black said the team had no comment on the  
Times report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not ready to discuss that publicly yet,'' Black said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rambis led the Lakers past Houston in the first round of the NBA  
playoffs before losing four straight to San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The feeling is this team has to grow together, and you don't  
do that by firing the coach after such a traumatic season,'' one 
Times source said. 
</P>
<P>
	West and Kupchak surveyed key Laker players about Rambis and  
several -- led by a rousing endorsement by Kobe Bryant -- said they 
would fully support his return, the Times sources said.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives Angry Over Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now it's Speaker Dennis Hastert's turn to deal  
with House conservatives unhappy with the way this year's budget 
fight is shaping up. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, it was House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who bore  
the brunt of conservative anger over end-of-year concessions to 
President Clinton on spending. Unhappiness over last fall's deal 
with Clinton that added $21 billion in spending was one factor in 
Gingrich's toppling from the speakership last year. 
</P>
<P>
	With Gingrich gone, his less confrontational successor, Hastert,  
is dealing anew with unhappy conservatives who say leaders are on 
course to again let Clinton win billions in additional domestic 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are set up for the same kind of train wreck we had last  
year with the present'' leadership strategy, said Rep. Mark 
Sanford, R-S.C., one of the conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday and Wednesday, conservatives all but halted House  
work on the first spending bill of the year, a $61 billion measure 
financing farm and food programs. The group has forced votes on a 
pile of amendments, such as cutting $300,000 for peanut research 
and $5 million for wood research. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was losing almost every vote, but their point was  
clear: Current GOP strategy is flawed and ensures Clinton will win 
billions in extra spending this fall. And since that money is 
likely to come from Social Security surpluses, that means 
Republicans will have broken their pledge not to touch that 
program's money. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about the agriculture bill,'' said one of them,  
Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. ``It's about keeping our word to not spend 
Social Security money, and having a plan to not spend it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conservatives' slowdown tactics forced Hastert, R-Ill., to  
abandon plans for the House to complete the first two of the 13 
annual spending bills for fiscal 2000 this week. Instead, the bills 
won't be considered until lawmakers return from their weeklong 
Memorial Day break next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite conservative demands, most lawmakers believe that  
billions of extra dollars will go to schools, the environment and 
other social programs for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	At least some of that money is likely to come from breaking  
spending limits imposed by the GOP-written budget Congress approved 
last month. The source of that money: Social Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, White House budget chief Jacob Lew signaled the  
Clinton administration was content -- for now -- to let Republicans 
continue to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at the Brookings Institution, Lew criticized  
Republicans for planning spending bills so low that they are 
``gambling with our future.'' But he also said finding extra money 
by breaking the spending caps would be an ``abandonment of fiscal 
discipline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That statement, in effect, makes it harder for the spending  
question to be resolved soon because the GOP is unlikely to suggest 
breaking the budget limits before the administration does. 
</P>
<P>
	Lew suggested a way out that has little chance of passage:  
Overhaul Social Security and Medicare, then pay for added domestic 
spending by increasing cigarette taxes and fees for food safety 
inspections, as well as following other money-raising suggestions 
Clinton made in his budget in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservatives' success in derailing that schedule  
spotlighted how hard it is for Hastert to control the House with 
the GOP's narrow margin, in which defections by just five 
Republicans can sink a bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than threatening the mavericks, participants in a  
closed-door GOP meeting Wednesday said Hastert called on 
Republicans to work together and said a budget strategy would be 
ready soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current GOP plans, $536 billion has been distributed among  
the 13 spending bills in a way that all but ensures that about five 
of the bigger, more controversial bills will not pass the House, 
let alone become law. These cover education, veterans, national 
parks and other domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives want the $536 billion rearranged so all 13 bills  
can pass the House, giving the House a better bargaining position 
with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservatives' tactics have also frayed tempers.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., said in an interview that  
conservatives were using ``demagoguery'' in introducing a parade of 
amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all believe the entire world is watching C-SPAN,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the House floor, Coburn answered complaints from farm-state  
lawmakers about the conservatives' ``nitpick'' amendments by 
calling them ``a little bit arrogant'' for objecting to debating 
the bill's content.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Infinity Broadcasting, the radio arm of CBS, is  
buying the nation's largest outdoor advertising company Outdoor 
Systems for $6.5 billion in stock, the companies announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which had been rumored for more than a week, makes  
Infinity the largest outdoor advertising company in the United 
States and gives CBS a wider array of options to offer advertisers. 
CBS has been moving toward selling packages of advertising across 
its media outlets, which include network TV, radio and Internet 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Infinity is also assuming $1.8 billion in debt in the deal.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest acquisition for Mel Karmazin, who is chairman  
of both CBS and Infinity Broadcasting, which he headed before it 
was bought by CBS three years ago. Infinity is the second-largest 
radio company in the nation, behind Chancellor Media, with more 
than 160 stations. Infinity also has outdoor advertising 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Karmazin said in a statement that the purchase of Outdoor  
Systems ``extends our reach and establishes Infinity as the 
undisputed leader in the outdoor advertising business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outdoor Systems has some 110,000 outdoor advertising spaces such  
as billboards in major markets throughout the United States, Canada 
and Mexico. The company, which is based in Phoenix, also has a huge 
presence in New York, where it has 125,000 advertising displays in 
subways. 
</P>
<P>
	In early April, CBS bought King World Productions, the leading  
syndicator of television programming, for $2.5 billion in stock. 
King World distributes several hit shows including ``The Oprah 
Winfrey Show,'' ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Karmazin, CBS has also made more aggressive moves into the  
Internet business, exchanging promotion time on its advertising 
outlets for large equity stakes in startup companies. So far the 
strategy has paid off handsomely thanks to the successful IPOs of 
Internet darlings like MarketWatch.com.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Want In On Regional Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Airlines want to fly more of the regional jets  
that are increasingly popular with travelers, but there's likely to 
be turbulence ahead as they wrangle with pilots unions about 
control and wage parity. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines this week became the latest carrier to seek  
union permission to sharply increase regional jet purchases, 
presenting its case to the Air Line Pilots Association's regional 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Airlines are ordering them in large numbers because the  
customer clearly likes them over turboprops,'' United spokesman Joe 
Hopkins said Thursday. ``Since regional jets are important feeders 
into our hub cities, we do want to maintain parity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regional jets usually seat no more than 70 people and have  
become popular tools for airlines to ferry consumers from small- 
and medium-size cities to large airports. Passengers prefer those 
planes over noisy turboprops because of their speed and perceived 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots unions, however, worry about what an increased emphasis  
on regional jets will mean for the future and fear airlines will 
use such jets to replace larger planes, which pilots are paid more 
to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest pilots went out on strike last year in part over  
concerns of losing pilot jobs because Northwest was buying and 
leasing smaller regional jets to Mesaba Airlines, its Airlink 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviation analysts say unions must realize the disadvantages of  
limiting regional jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have more (regional jet) feeds, then you have more  
traffic that can fill up your aircraft,'' said Brian Harris at 
Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots unions for United, American Airlines, Northwest Airlines,  
Trans World Airlines and US Airways earlier this decade negotiated 
contracts that limit the number of regional jets a carrier or its 
contract subsidiary can fly. Such agreements are called ``scope 
clauses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America West, Delta Air Lines and Continental do not limit the  
number of regional jets, although they do have restrictions on the 
number of seats on a plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Elk Grove Village-based United proposed allowing its commuter  
partners to fly up to 284 small jets instead of 65. The plan comes 
as a new study commissioned by more than a dozen airports warned 
that labor's restrictions on such moves hamper competition in 
smaller cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by GKMG, a Washington-based airline consulting group  
concluded 1,452 unserved markets could sustain regional jet service 
but restrictions bar service to 800 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Line Pilots Association criticized the report, noting  
that many of the airlines base their decisions about flying 
regional jets on the potential for profits rather than whether a 
city can support service. 
</P>
<P>
	Major carriers handle commuter jet service in different ways,  
requiring decisions to be made on a case-by-case basis, said Capt. 
Madison Walton, a spokesman for United's pilots union chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines owns its commuter jet division, while  
Northwest owns the planes and leases them to others and Delta has a 
stake in its commuter partners. 
</P>
<P>
	United contracts with regional carriers that operate under the  
United Express banner, agreements that could leave the majority 
employee-owned carrier vulnerable at the end of those contracts, 
Walton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an acknowledgment of the value of feeds into our hubs  
being able to grow the airline,'' he said. ``But the concern is 
that the Express carriers basically have control, and the economics 
of whether we should continue that, buy our own planes with 
corporate capital or take a greater (financial) interest in Express 
carriers has to be considered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walton said the pilots' Master Executive Council had no  
timetable for making a decision on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier hopes to reach agreement by March, the deadline for  
United Express carriers to exercise delivery options for additional 
regional jets.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Rise Slightly / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages remains at the highest level in more than two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The average stayed at 7.23 percent for a second straight week,  
the highest level since November of 1997, according to a weekly 
survey by Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, rates have fluctuated between 6.74 percent at  
the end of January and the current 7.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.84 percent this week, up only slightly from 6.83 percent 
a week earlier, Freddie Mac reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.73 percent, down from 5.76 percent the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Gun Groups Say Laws Aren't Enforced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Congress struggles with new gun control  
proposals, the question of whether the federal government does 
enough to enforce the laws already in place has become a key 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association and some Republicans say that if  
America really wants to crack down on gun crimes, the answer lies 
in enforcing the more than 20,000 existing local and federal gun 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to pass a federal law, it sends a wrong  
message not to prosecute it,'' said James Baker, the NRA's chief 
lobbyist. ``And if you're not prosecuting, why do you need more 
laws?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since President Clinton took office, federal prosecutions of  
gun-related crimes have dropped more than 40 percent, the NRA said. 
The nation has a zero-tolerance policy against young people 
bringing guns to school, for example, yet the federal government 
over the past two years prosecuted just eight children for that, 
Baker notes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration says gun groups are using the  
wrong statistics, looking only at the drop in prosecutions since 
1992, when violent crime overall -- and thus prosecutions -- began to 
drop after historic highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun groups also ignore the recent federal cooperation with local  
police to prevent illegal sales and go after people who commit 
crimes with guns and the dealers who illegally supply them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is disingenuous for them to criticize when they are looking  
at the wrong numbers,'' Justice Department spokesman Brian Steel 
said, adding that federal, state and local prosecutions together 
have climbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, federal laws are often aimed at preventing gun  
violence -- by keeping felons from buying guns, for example -- more 
than at producing prosecutions. The Brady Law's instant background 
checks have prevented 250,000 felons from buying guns, Steel says. 
And some crimes, such as those by teen-agers and children, are 
simply better handled by local authorities, Attorney General Janet 
Reno said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even gun-control advocates agree more could be done. The  
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms should more aggressively 
put out of business any licensed gun dealer who breaks federal 
rules, says Douglas Weil, research director for the Center to 
Prevent Handgun Violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials do plan to review ``just what needs to be done with  
state and local authorities to ensure the appropriate prosecution 
of these cases,'' Reno said last week. Republicans are expected to 
grill her deputy on the issue at a hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A program in Richmond, Va., praised by the NRA in newspaper ads  
and before Congress, has dominated much of the enforcement debate. 
After local and federal officials began Project Exile, which 
mandates a five-year jail term for any felon caught with a firearm, 
gun murders dropped by 41 percent in one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rochester, N.Y., also has signed on to the program, but the NRA  
complains the Clinton administration isn't providing money to 
duplicate the effort nationwide. Nevertheless, Clinton praised the 
program in a March radio address as Richmond's police chief looked 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to give cities the flexibility to do whatever works in  
their community,'' Steel said. ``Richmond had a particular problem 
with convicted felons getting guns. Boston had a problem with 
gangs. They used different strategies, and they both had success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Boston program, begun in 1995, traces where young  
criminals got their guns and has become a precursor of the ATF 
effort to trace guns used in juvenile crime -- a program Clinton is 
expanding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed a bill last week that includes a measure to  
revoke gun ownership rights for anyone convicted of a firearms 
crime as a juvenile, new background checks at gun shows and a 
requirement that safety devices be sold with all new handguns. The 
House is expected to take up similar proposals in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even as lawmakers consider new restrictions, they insist the  
focus should be on enforcement, perhaps by giving more money to 
police and to federal prosecutors or to gun-safety education 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``To really maximize our impact ... we've got to prosecute the  
laws we've got,'' said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.

<HEADLINE> Berry Pickers' Union Votes Counted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALINAS, Calif. (AP) -- Workers at the nation's largest  
strawberry grower won't know which union will represent them in 
contract negotiations until state labor officials sort out 
challenges to the eligibility of some voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote by workers at Coastal Berry Co. on Wednesday was  
considered a key test of the United Farm Workers' effort to regain 
the influence it had in agriculture under the leadership of the 
late Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	But the best the UFW can appear to hope for is a runoff election  
against its rival union, the Coastal Berry of California Farm 
Worker Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW received votes from 577 of the opened ballots, Coastal  
Berry had 646, and 79 opted for no union representation, labor 
officials said. The eligibility of 60 additional voters was 
challenged, mostly by labor officials but some by the unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the voting rules, a runoff is required unless one of the  
three options wins a simple majority. Because of the eligibility 
challenges, it was still uncertain today whether Coastal Berry 
would have enough to win a majority, or if it would have to face 
UFW in a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural Labor Relations Board officials planned to meet  
today to discuss the unresolved ballots, said the board's regional 
director Fred Capuyan, but a final tally could be days away. 
</P>
<P>
	The sweat was visible on the forehead of strawberry picker Jose  
Rojas as he waited to learn the results of the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	For nine years, Rojas has worked in Watsonville at Coastal  
Berry. He cast his ballot in favor of the UFW, and said a vote to 
unionize would make his backbreaking efforts for his three sons 
worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my sacrifice to be worth a better life for them,''  
Rojas said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the vote are considered pivotal in the UFW's  
effort to overcome the doldrums it fell into even before the 1993 
death of Chavez, who inspired 80,000 farm workers to join up by 
1970. Union membership had declined to 20,000 by the time he died. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the UFW launched its rebuilding campaign in the  
strawberry fields, where picking the crops is entry-level farm 
work, the most backbreaking, low-skilled labor available. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the UFW has won 18 union elections and signed 22  
first-time contracts with growers of other crops, increasing 
overall membership to 27,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state's $600 million strawberry industry, which employs  
about 20,000 workers, has been resistant. Until this week, the only 
strawberry grower to sign a UFW contract was a small organic farm 
with 50 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW committed itself to winning at Coastal Berry five years  
ago, hoping a victory would create momentum for similar successes 
throughout California's farm fields. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign has been plagued by setbacks.  
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a long struggle at Coastal Berry,'' said UFW  
spokesman Marc Grossman. ``The strawberry industry wants to stop 
UFW progress at all costs, and Coastal Berry could be a crucial 
turning point for the workers statewide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Berry Co. President Ernie Farley said the company was  
neutral on who represents the workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just looking forward to an end to the whole process,''  
he said. ``We spend an awful lot of time managing that process 
rather than managing the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Worker's pickers are treated better than some in the  
berry fields, Farley said. They earn an average wage of $7.50 to 
$8.50 an hour and have full medical and dental benefits for 
themselves and dependents.

	GDP Growing at 4.1 Percent Rate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The biggest consumer spending spree in 11  
years kept the economy growing at a robust rate in the year's first 
quarter. The economy grew at an annual rate of 4.1 percent, even 
though the country's trade deficit was a bigger drag on growth than 
previously thought, the Commerce Department said. The government's 
new figure for gross domestic product represented a slight downward 
revision from a 4.5 percent figure released a month ago, but it 
still showed a remarkably strong economy. The GDP report also 
showed that corporate profits, which had been in the doldrums, had 
a sizable rebound for the first quarter.

dipped to 87 last month from 88 in March. The index, based on 100, 
was 90 in April 1998. The regions with the largest declines in

latest in a series of 20-year lows, before recovering somewhat to 
finish the day at $268.80. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, 
where prices of futures contracts reached a 20-year low yesterday, 
gold for June delivery rose $1 today to close at $270.50 an ounce.

for health insurance and business meals. The most costly item, at 
$15 billion over five years, would lower from 39.4 percent to 34 
percent the top individual income tax rate for partnerships, 
including closely held ones known as S corporations, and certain 
other small businesses. Rep. Jim Talent, R-Mo., chairman of the 
House Small Business Committee, said supporters will seek to

agreed to sacrifice its rival operating-system software, OS/2. 
Garry Norris, who will be one of the government's final witnesses 
in its antitrust case, said that IBM rejected the overture and said 
it planned to sell both Windows and OS/2. Norris also testified 
that major computer makers, such as Compaq, agreed not to sell OS/2 
on their machines because of threats from Microsoft. IBM's system 
ultimately proved a commercial failure. IBM stock closed down 2 1/8 at 
116 and Microsoft fell 1/8 to 78 3/8.

	Fed Proposes Special Loans to Banks

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve is proposing a plan for  
special lending to banks, thrifts and credit unions that might need 
emergency money because of the Year 2000 date change. The central 
bank is seeking public comment on the proposal, which would offer 
these special loans to financial institutions from Nov. 1 through 
next April 7. The plan would allow banks, thrifts and credit unions 
``to confidently commit to supplying loans to other financial 
institutions and businesses through the rollover to the new 
century,'' the Fed said. Last year, the Fed ordered an additional 
$50 billion of new currency to put into circulation in the event 
people make a run on banks and automated teller machines late in

according to research that could lead to new ways of reactivating 
the natural defenses of AIDS and cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The thymus, a pinkish-gray organ near the heart, is the primary  
source of germ-fighting T cells. It was believed to be active only 
during fetal development and childhood before slowly turning into 
fat in adults. 
</P>
<P>
	The research reported Thursday in the journal Immunity suggests  
that although the gland's productivity slows with age, it remains 
active nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us hope that if we can find ways to boost up the  
activity of the thymus, we could speed up the replacement of T 
cells'' lost to the AIDS virus, said Beth D. Jamieson, a biologist 
at the University of California, Los Angeles AIDS Institute who led 
the study. ``There's still a source available for T cells, which 
was not thought to be the case previously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs also could be developed for cancer patients whose immune  
systems have been destroyed by chemotherapy. But tests of possible 
treatments are at least two years away, Jamieson said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Schwartz, professor of molecular microbiology-immunology  
at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, said the study offers 
important information that will be ``very useful for understanding 
how we can generate new immune responses as we get older.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It means we don't have to rely on T cells that are produced in  
the first decade of our lives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies showed that new T cells were being produced by  
AIDS patients who had been taking potent combinations of AIDS 
drugs. But it was not known where in the body those cells were 
being created. 
</P>
<P>
	The research found that the thymus continues to turn stem cells  
produced by bone marrow into T cells that recognize the body's 
foreign invaders and either attack them directly or produce 
antibodies to finish them off. 
</P>
<P>
	The UCLA researchers studied more than a dozen thymuses from  
organ donors and people who had sections of their glands removed 
during heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Although aging does not appear to decrease the effectiveness of  
the new T cells, it does lead to a reduction in quantity. The 
oldest subject in the testing was 56.

	LONDON (AP) -- Forget the critics -- the new ``Star Wars'' film  
has earned a glowing review from a leader of the Church of England. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bishop of Oxford, the Right Rev. Richard Harries, said films  
such as ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' can reinforce 
``the truth and strength of religion'' because they carry the 
message that goodness will prevail over evil. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that if people get reassurance that good will overcome  
evil through a film, that far from being a threat to religion, it 
is an echo of what religion, at least the Christian religion, is

<HEADLINE> Report: Coach Shurmur Has Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	APPLETON, Wis. (AP) -- Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator  
Fritz Shurmur has taken a leave of absence because of cancer, 
several newspapers reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur arrived Wednesday in Green Bay, where he formerly served  
the Packers as defensive boss, and where he might undergo 
treatment, The Post- Crescent said, quoting unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times, citing unidentified sources, also reported  
the cancer diagnosis Thursday. The Times said Shurmur first 
complained of feeling ill more than a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But he didn't see a doctor until last week, when he reported for  
a regularly scheduled physical for all team coaches. Tests were 
ordered for Monday and Tuesday of this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur, 66, beginning his 25th year in NFL coaching, was with  
the Packers from 1994-1998, after which he joined former Packers 
coach Mike Holmgren in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fritz has been diagnosed with a serious illness that will  
require a period of extensive treatment,'' Holmgren said Wednesday 
in a statement in Seattle, declining to identify the illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur has not been available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't want a lot of detail out there about this,''  
Holmgren told the Times later Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The departure leaves a huge void in the Seattle staff at a time  
when the coaches are implementing their new system under Holmgren. 
Shurmur was considered a critical part of the Packers' success 
under Holmgren, which culminated in back-to-back Super Bowl 
appearances in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The man is a defensive brain and a mind,'' said Seahawks  
defensive end Sam Adams. ``He's a supernova on defense, so to 
speak.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Want Investigation of GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats want the Justice Department and  
Congress to investigate whether House Republican leaders are 
violating campaign finance laws with a planned $25 million fund for 
key House races next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers to the House's third-ranking Republican, Majority Whip  
Tom DeLay of Texas, created the Republican Majority Issues Campaign 
to raise and spend that much in two dozen races in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois, Majority Leader Dick  
Armey of Texas and the No. 4 Republican, Oklahoma's J.C. Watts, 
chairman of the Republican Conference, also are raising money for 
the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign finance watchdog groups criticized the fund-raising  
strategy on a variety of fronts -- not the least of which is 
organizers' decision to keep their donor list secret. 
</P>
<P>
	``For members of Congress to set up an invisible slush fund to  
collect $25 million to influence the 2000 elections raises all 
sorts of questions,'' Larry Makinson, executive director of the 
Center for Responsive Politics, said today. ``Who's giving the 
money? What promises are being made, either explicit or 
understood?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the chairman and top Democrat on the House ethics  
committee took the unusual step of releasing a letter saying the 
panel had not approved the GOP leaders' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Approval from the ethics committee ``was never sought and, thus,  
never granted,'' wrote the chairman, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, and 
Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign's organizer, Karl Gallant, said his fund meets all  
federal election laws and simply mirrors get-out-the-vote and issue 
advocacy campaigns by organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
	He contended the fund's activities do not have to be disclosed  
because it will operate independently and will not explicitly 
advocate for or against individual candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It absolutely amazes me that Big Labor can go out and mobilize  
liberal votes ... but suddenly conservatives don't have First 
Amendment rights,'' he said Thursday, adding that his ``grudging 
admiration'' for the AFL-CIO's advocacy campaign prompted him to 
emulate that effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallant said he will not disclose contributors' names because it  
would put the campaign at a ``strategic disadvantage'' to unions. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the AFL-CIO contributed $35 million in an unsuccessful  
effort to help Democrats retake control of the House. Union leaders 
are pledging more than $40 million for television ads and 
mobilizing voters next year. 
</P>
<P>
	One request for an investigation came in a letter this week to  
Attorney General Janet Reno from Robert Bauer, an attorney for the 
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department declined comment Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	DeLay's congressional aides referred questions to Gallant, who  
previously headed DeLay's leadership political action committee. 
Armey's office declined comment, as did Watts'. Hastert's spokesman 
could not be reached immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the top Democrat on the House Government Reform  
Committee asked the panel's chairman, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., to 
include the GOP fund raising in the committee's current 
investigation of Democratic fund-raising abuses from the 1996 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	A committee spokesman, Mark Corallo, said the letter from Rep.  
Henry Waxman, D-Calif., has not been received.

<HEADLINE> Fed Proposes Special Loans to Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve is proposing a plan for  
special lending to banks, thrifts and credit unions that might need 
emergency money because of consumers' fears about the Year 2000 
date change. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank is seeking public comment on the proposal,  
which would offer these special loans to financial institutions 
from Nov. 1 through next April 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would allow banks, thrifts and credit unions ``to  
confidently commit to supplying loans to other financial 
institutions and businesses through the rollover to the new 
century,'' the Fed said recently in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second major step taken by the central bank designed  
to avert possible Year 2000 disruptions in the nation's banking 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the Fed ordered an additional $50 billion of new  
currency to put into circulation in the event people make a run on 
banks and automated teller machines late in the year. By year's 
end, $200 billion in currency will be stored in government vaults, 
up from the $150 billion normally held in reserve. That's in 
addition to the $460 billion in notes circulating in the United 
States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	For the special Year 2000 loans, the interest rate charged by  
the Fed would be slightly higher than the prevailing ``federal 
funds rate,'' currently around 4.75 percent, which banks charge 
each other for overnight loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's helpful,'' said Jim McLaughlin, director of  
regulatory affairs at the American Bankers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the special loans would provide an extra cushion of cash  
to the system as a backup if needed, although the trade group 
anticipates that very few banks will have to use it. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank acknowledged that ``uncertainty surrounds  
potential developments over the period'' because of the millennial 
date change. But it stressed that it does not expect widespread or 
prolonged computer disruptions from the technology problem, caused 
by the possibility that some computers originally programmed to 
recognize only the last two digits of a year could interpret 2000 
as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Government regulators have lauded the nation's banking industry  
for its work preparing for the date change. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankers have promised consumers that ATM machines, credit cards,  
checks and banking services will function normally through the date 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	However, banks, thrifts and credit unions, all of which are  
closely regulated, are linked with numerous companies that provide 
services to banks and operate with less government supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, the Fed and four other bank regulatory agencies,  
worried about the Year 2000 readiness of a big ATM service company 
in the West, ordered it to get in shape by June 30 or face possible 
contract cancellations by its 750 bank customers.

<HEADLINE> Senate Tightens Up on Tech Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate easily approved measures today to  
expand oversight of technology exports and to tighten security at 
weapons laboratories in the aftermath of a House report alleging 
Chinese espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	But efforts toward broader measures fell victim to partisan  
wrangling in both congressional chambers and were postponed until 
after a 10-day congressional recess for Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats used delaying tactics to stall a GOP-sponsored  
measure that would reorganize the Energy Department after the 
proposal drew a veto threat from the Clinton administration. The 
proposal would create a new assistant secretary for defense 
programs who would report directly to the president and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., put off action on that  
measure Thursday until a later date as the Senate worked toward 
completion of a $288.8 billion Defense Department spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the controversial amendment was jettisoned, the Senate  
passed the defense bill 92 to 3. It would spend $8.3 billion more 
than President Clinton requested in the fiscal year that begins Oct 
1, including authorizing a 4.8 percent across-the-board military 
pay raise next Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, by voice vote, the Senate adopted a set of proposals by  
Lott that was also endorsed by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, 
D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	The package would expand the role of intelligence agencies in  
reviewing export licenses, boost Pentagon monitoring of satellite 
launches in China and require the administration to report to 
Congress on any security breaches. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also put the FBI solely in charge of all background  
investigations of workers at Energy Department weapons 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, efforts by the House to take up its own package,  
including many recommendations from the espionage report, drew 
political fire from both sides, prompting House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert to abruptly postpone action until next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior Democrat on the House espionage panel, Rep. Norman  
Dicks of Washington, accused Republican leaders of blocking 
consideration of some of the panel's recommendations that are 
supported by the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	One was a measure to register support for steps already taken or  
being planned by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to increase 
security at nuclear weapons labs. The Energy Department's nuclear 
weapons lab in Los Alamos, N.M., was a target of alleged Chinese 
espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an insult,'' Dicks said. ``I am very disappointed that  
the Republican leadership has chosen to take a partisan approach to 
implementing our report. We spent nine months working on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans denied they were trying to stifle debate.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of the espionage  
investigation, told reporters Dicks should have been allowed to 
present his amendment and suggested there had been a 
misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``silver lining,'' Cox said, is that the House now will have  
more time to work out a more comprehensive package. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic opposition to going ahead with the House debate was  
compounded by the objections of Republican conservatives, who 
criticized a leadership decision to strip from the overall defense 
bill a provision by the House Armed Services Committee to block 
funds for the military operation in Yugoslavia after Oct. 1 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders said they had done so to ease administration  
concerns that such language would undermine U.S. troops in the 
Balkans -- and blamed Democratic leaders for causing the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a breakdown on the president's side of the agreement,''  
said Hastert. 
</P>
<P>
	The impasse on the Senate side was over an amendment by Sens.  
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, to create a 
new assistant secretary for defense programs in the Energy 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	He or she would have wide-ranging authority and could bypass the  
energy secretary in dealing directly with the president and 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, the energy secretary, opposed the proposal as too  
extensive and, in a letter to Senate leaders, complained ``this 
proposal would effectively cancel my six-month effort to strengthen 
security.'' He said he would threaten a veto if it were adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	Murkowski said, ``This is an effort to establish  
accountability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three who voted ``no'' on final Senate passage of the  
defense bill were Russ Feingold, D-Wis.; Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., and 
Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bills are H.R. 1401 and S 1059.

<HEADLINE> Sinatra Kidnapper Appeals Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The man who orchestrated the kidnapping of  
Frank Sinatra's son in 1963 argues a state law barring him from 
profiting from the crime is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd District Court of Appeal did not immediately rule  
Wednesday on the appeal by Barry Keenan. Keenan is seeking to 
overturn a court order obtained by Frank Sinatra Jr. that 
temporarily bars Columbia Pictures, which is making a movie about 
the crime, from paying Keenan for his story. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinatra was 19 when he was abducted from Harrah's Casino at Lake  
Tahoe, Nev., on Dec. 8, 1963. He was released unharmed after a 
ransom payment. Keenan and accomplices Joseph Amsler and John Irwin 
were captured and convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The arguments focused on whether the California law barring  
criminals from profiting from their actions violates the First 
Amendment and is retroactive punishment. The 1986 law says that any 
payments must go into trusts for victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan's lawyer, Stephen Rohde, said imposing the law on his  
client violates state and federal prohibitions on retroactive 
punishment because Keenan was convicted before it was enacted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinatra's attorney, Richard B. Specter, spoke briefly, telling  
the judges: ``This law clearly is constitutional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan is now a successful developer who lives in Mississippi.  
In a statement handed to reporters, he said he never sought to 
profit from the movie and was only interested in setting the record 
straight after more than 35 years of erroneous stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just exhausted by the whole process,'' he said. ``If I had  
to do it again I would never have gotten involved in this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan, who blames his actions on drugs and alcohol, served less  
than five years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Shareholders OK Exxon, Mobil Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Only regulatory approval now stands between Exxon  
and Mobil and their history-making $82.2 billion merger, but 
analysts said consumers shouldn't worry about a possible increase 
at the gas pumps if that occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company ``can't exert undue influence on the retail  
market because most of the major oil companies don't own their own 
retail stations -- they're owned by individuals,'' said Keith 
Petersen of Salomon Smith Barney in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact on consumers will be hardly noticeable,'' agreed  
Michael L. Mayer of Schroder &AMP; Co. ``Gasoline marketing in the U.S. 
is highly competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate meetings Thursday, shareholders of each company  
overwhelmingly approved the marriage, which would produce one of 
the world's largest companies with about $150 billion in combined 
1998 revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would be called Exxon Mobil Corp. and have  
headquarters in Irving, Exxon's current home. Mobil is based in 
Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon's chairman Lee R. Raymond said the combined company will  
be more cost-efficient -- cutting costs by $2.8 billion -- and better 
able to compete with international competitors, including state-run 
oil companies, than would either Exxon or Mobil alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond, who would become chairman of the new company,  
acknowledged that federal regulators could force the sale of some 
gas stations where the two brands compete head to head. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said both nameplates -- the Exxon tiger and Mobil's red  
Pegasus -- would be retained. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators in the United States and Europe must still approve  
the deal, which company officials said they expect by October. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent analysts generally view the merger as benign for  
consumers, even though it would create the world's largest energy 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would expect that the regulators would look at this closely  
... I haven't seen anything yet that would cause a reason for 
concern,'' said Bill Noble, an AAA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the American Petroleum Institute, the new company  
would account for 12 percent of U.S. refining capacity and 7 
percent worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies predicted that the merger will result in the loss  
of 9,000 jobs -- 7 percent of their combined worldwide work force -- 
but admitted that's just an estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even without mergers, there would be layoffs in this  
business,'' said Mobil chairman Lucio Noto, who would become vice 
chairman of the combined company. ``Costs have to come down, people 
have to get more efficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders agreed. More than 99 percent of the shares in Exxon  
were voted in favor of the marriage, as were more than 98 percent 
of Mobil shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon Mobil will have about 48,500 gas stations around the  
world, with roughly a third in the United States, plus exploration 
and production operations worldwide. On a daily basis, the 
companies together produce 2.5 million barrels of oil and 
equivalent amounts of natural gas -- more than the country of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies announced plans to merge in December. Exxon is  
the biggest U.S. oil company and Mobil is No. 2. The merger will 
create the sixth-largest oil producer in the world and the largest 
that is privately owned. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination is part of a consolidation trend in the oil  
industry, which most observers expect will continue. BP-Amoco, 
itself the creation of a 1998 merger between British Petroleum and 
Amoco Corp., has agreed to buy Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron and Texaco are also discussing a merger, though the Wall  
Street Journal reported Thursday that negotiations between the two 
companies are bogging down over a number of issues, including 
control of the combined company.

<HEADLINE> Ackroyd, Dad Give Millennium Gift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Dan Aykroyd and his father, Peter, have joined  
the rush to mark the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the pair launched the ``Our Millennium'' project,  
which invites Canadians to give millennium gifts to their 
communities -- and give people something more than a good party to 
remember the dawn of the next 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have to look in your community where there's a  
need for something,'' said Dan Ackroyd, an Ontario native and a 
star of such films as ``Ghostbusters'' and ``The Blues Brothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Aykroyd family made the first donation with the gift of a

<HEADLINE> IRL Reducing Speeds for Texas Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indy Racing League, reeling from a crash  
that killed three fans, hopes slower speeds will make the stands 
safer. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL announced Thursday it has imposed new engine rules for  
the June 12 race at Texas Motor Speedway, a high-banked oval where 
speeds of more than 228 mph were run a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive director Leo Mehl said engines must operate at no more  
than 10,000 rpms after Sunday's Indy 500. The new specifications, 
which reduce the cars' horsepower, will be used for the remaining 
seven IRL events, beginning with the Longhorn 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will definitely slow the cars down,'' Mehl said. ``There  
are obvious reasons for doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second major IRL change this week. On Monday,  
officials unveiled a new system that uses cables in cars in an 
attempt to prevent wheels and suspension parts from reaching the 
stands during wrecks. 
</P>
<P>
	Three fans died and eight were injured when debris flew into the  
stands during a crash at the May 1 Visionaire 500 at Lowe's Motor 
Speedway in Concord, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL already reduced rpms from 10,500 to 10,300 at the  
beginning of this season. Mehl said the latest change should cut 
the top speeds at Texas to about 220 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the best speed for the June race at Texas was more  
than 228 mph. It dropped to about 224 mph for a second IRL event in 
September at the 1.5-mile track in Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas and Lowe's tracks are almost identical high-banked  
ovals. Indianapolis Motor Speedway is much flatter, so the risk of 
debris flying into the stands is not as great. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lowe's and Texas tracks are both owned by Bruton Smith's  
Speedway Motorsports Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to show Bruton and everyone else that we are  
responding to the tragedy at Charlotte,'' Mehl said. ``This is one 
of the ways we can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one driver doesn't like the change. Greg Ray, who will  
start from the middle of the front row at the Indy 500, said it 
would be difficult for teams to make such a significant adjustment 
with only two weeks between races. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too quick, just too quick to make changes like that,''  
Ray said. ``They should have announced it earlier, like six or 
eight weeks ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mehl disputed Ray's view of the situation, noting that each car  
is equipped with a ``rev limiter'' to control rpms. The changes 
were supported by several drivers -- including defending champion 
Eddie Cheever. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything we can do to improve safety is not a mistake,'' Mehl  
said. ``The drivers like to go fast. Some drivers want to race 
side-by-side going 240 mph.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever compared the IRL change with restrictor plates, a  
carburetor device imposed by NASCAR to reduce speeds for its stock 
cars on superspeedways at Daytona Beach, Fla., and Talladega, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, 5 mph slower is not going to make it a worse race  
than we have now,'' Cheever said. ``The changes they've made are 
very intelligent. Is it the final solution? No. It's a continuing 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Schmidt, the seventh-fastest qualifier at Indy, said the  
teams always find ways to adapt to new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's remarkable that they lowered it to 10,300 and we're going  
3 mph faster than we were here last year, as far as the pole 
speed,'' he said. ``I don't think it's going to make it any worse 
of a race. It may slow it down, but it may make it just more 
exciting for the fans.''

<HEADLINE> Exxon, Mobil Shareholders OK Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Shareholders of Exxon and Mobil voted today to  
approve the $82.2 billion merger between the two largest U.S. oil 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 99 percent of the shares in Exxon were voted in favor  
of the marriage, as were more than 98 percent of Mobil shares. 
Shareholders of both companies were meeting separately in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators in the United States and Europe must still approve  
the deal before the companies could effect the merger. The 
shareholders' approval had been expected by company officials and 
independent analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in everyone's interest,'' said analyst Keith Petersen of  
Salomon Smith Barney in New York. He predicted the deal will also 
pass antitrust muster if the companies agree to sell some gas 
stations where they compete head-to-head. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't exert undue influence on the retail market because  
most of the major oil companies don't own their own retail stations 
-- they're owned by individuals,'' Petersen said. ``And there's an 
excess of refining capacity, which is why they're having negative 
operating margins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon chairman Lee R. Raymond was not specific today about the  
fate of Exxon and Mobil gas stations, a matter under review by 
federal regulators. Analysts expect the company would have to sell 
many gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suffice it to say, once we get through the regulatory process,  
especially in the Washington (D.C.) area, there will be both Exxon 
and Mobil stations (at) which you can continue to buy our 
products,'' Raymond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond and Mobil chairman Lucio A. Noto planned a celebratory  
news conference after the twin votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to lead to the loss of about 9,000 jobs -- 7  
percent of the companies' worldwide work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would be called Exxon Mobil Corp. and have  
headquarters in Irving, Exxon's current home. Mobil is based in 
Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	If the merger is approved, Mobil shareholders will get 1.32  
shares of the new company's stock for each share of Mobil common 
stock. Exxon shareholders would keep their existing shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon shareholders would own about 70 percent of the new  
company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Trade Commission officials have said they are  
particularly interested in how the merger would affect competition 
in the Northeast, Gulf Coast and California, where the two 
companies compete head-to-head in refining and retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials say the two companies control more than 15  
percent of the branded retail gasoline stations in the Northeast 
and about 18 percent of the Gulf Coast's refining capacity.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Clinton Help May Hurt Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore might want to keep his  
distance from President Clinton on the campaign trail, a new poll 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released Thursday indicates the  
public, by a 52-to-29 percent margin, says Clinton's active help in 
Gore's campaign would make them less likely to vote for Gore for 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll indicates Americans respect the vice president as a  
person, but have not yet warmed to him as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Four out of five see him as a good husband and father, and a  
majority say he has the experience to be president, is honest and 
trustworthy and cares about the needs of people like them. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has a 2-to-1 lead in the poll among Democrats and those  
leaning Democratic against his sole challenger for the party's 
nomination, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	But four out of 10 of all respondents say there is no chance  
they would vote for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost two-thirds of all respondents say Gore doesn't inspire  
them and 54 percent say he lacks vision on how to solve the big 
problems facing the country. Fifty-seven percent say his stands on 
issues are too close to Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Penn, a pollster and Gore adviser, noted Gore has taken a  
commanding lead among Democrats and has closed the gap in a 
head-to-head matchup against the GOP front-runner, Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush, from 21 points behind a month ago, to 14 points 
behind now. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Gore) is seen as honest, trustworthy and caring about people  
... Those are exactly the qualities that people say are the most 
important to them and what they're looking for in the next 
president,'' Penn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They give high job approval to President Clinton, but they  
want to see what the vice president would do if he were elected 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush leads Elizabeth Dole, former Red Cross president, by almost  
a 3-1 margin among those inclined to vote Republican, with other 
GOP candidates in single digits. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone survey of 1,050 adults was taken Sunday and Monday and  
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The 
margin of error for subgroups like Democrats and Republicans is 
plus or minus 5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> ''Home Improvement'' Gets Big Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The last ``Home Improvement'' drew an estimated  
35 million viewers, making it the fourth most-viewed series finale 
of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The show, which starred Tim Allen, went off the air Tuesday  
after an eight-year run. Only ``Seinfeld,'' ``Cheers'' and ``The 
Cosby Show'' drew more viewers during their series finales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled,'' said ABC Entertainment President Jamie  
Tarses. ``It's a testament to the kind of fan base the show had 
over the course of its run, the allegiance they felt and the 
affection they had for this family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 90-minute feature, next-door neighbor Wilson revealed  
his face for the first time since the show began. 
</P>
<P>
	The show had a 21.2 rating and a 34 share, meaning a third of  
the television sets in use at the time were tuned in to ``Home 
Improvement.'' By comparison, the season's top-rated series, 
``ER,'' averaged 25 million viewers this year. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Mad About You,'' which had its series finale on Monday  
night, drew 19.8 million viewers. Fox's ``Melrose Place'' had 10.4 
million viewers for its final show, also Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Skipper Sets Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- During his 203 days sailing the Around  
Alone race, Japanese skipper Minoru Saito lost an autopilot, his 
alternator, his food, his propeller and his centerboard. 
</P>
<P>
	But at 3:45 p.m. Wednesday the 65-year-old retired Tokyo  
businessman became the oldest sailor to complete the 27,000-mile 
course. He is among three people to finish it three times and is 
the first Japanese skipper to circle the globe three times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my last race,'' Saito said, lounging on the stern of  
Shuten-dohji II just after crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	He has sailed in the Around Alone three times since 1990, and  
has logged 173,000 miles overall in six trips around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a seaman in the old mold. He's got a lot of respect for  
the ocean and his little ship,'' said race director Mark Schrader. 
</P>
<P>
	Saito said he took his heart medicine every day, along with a  
little beer and sake, a Japanese alcoholic beverage. Now he plans 
to buy a smaller boat to cruise the Azores and the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese sailer was eighth overall and sixth in Class II.  
</P>
<P>
	As of Thursday afternoon, one boat remained on the water. Neil  
Hunter of Australia was expected to cross the finish line this 
weekend.

<HEADLINE> Avis Settles Wheelchair Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Avis, the nation's second largest rental car  
company, agreed Thursday to provide wheelchair-accessible shuttle 
buses at all its airport locations, the Justice Department 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The out-of-court agreement with the department resolves a 1996  
complaint by a wheelchair-using traveler who argued that Avis Rent 
A Car, Inc., violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by not 
providing an accessible bus between Detroit Metro Airport and Avis' 
off-site rental facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Avis agreed to ensure that each of its 36 airport shuttle  
systems has at least one wheelchair-accessible vehicle by Dec. 31, 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	During negotiations, Avis agreed to expand the settlement beyond  
Detroit Metro to all its airport shuttles, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the department's investigation began in 1997, only six of  
Avis' 286 shuttle vehicles were equipped with lifts for 
wheelchairs, the department said. Currently, 126 accessible 
vehicles are in use at Avis's airport locations nationwide. The 
agreement will bring that number to at least 153 accessible 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the summer travel season begins this Memorial Day weekend,  
airline travelers who use wheelchairs will be able to go from the 
airport terminal to their rental cars as easily as other 
customers,'' said acting Assistant Attorney General Bill Lann Lee, 
head of the civil rights division. ``This is a model agreement and 
Avis should be commended for its cooperation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ADA requires that companies operating shuttles over a fixed  
route ensure that newly acquired vehicles large enough for more 
than 16 people are accessible to the disabled, including those with 
wheelchairs. And Avis agreed to replace or refurbish every large 
shuttle vehicle it has acquired since Aug. 25, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Avis has already added wheelchair lifts to two vehicles at the  
Detroit Airport that the department determined should have them. 
The company also has removed architectural barriers in Detroit. And 
Avis agreed to continue to provide curbside service for the 
disabled at all airport locations although it is not required 
everywhere, said John Wodatch, chief of the department's disability 
rights section.

<HEADLINE> FDA Drug Warning Rule Taking Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consider the scenario: Your doctor prescribes  
Propulsid to ease severe nighttime heartburn, but forgets to ask if 
you're taking other medicines. And you forget to mention that 
another doctor recently prescribed the antibiotic erythromycin. 
</P>
<P>
	But if you take Propulsid and erythromycin together, you could  
die. 
</P>
<P>
	You're lucky. You read the special ``Patient Medication Guide''  
that Propulsid's maker provides with each box. 
</P>
<P>
	In bold print it says, ``What is the most important information  
I should know about Propulsid?'' The answer: Don't take it with any 
of nine other drugs, including erythromycin, or you risk a fatal 
irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before Janssen Pharmaceuticals voluntarily issued these  
special medication guides, a Washington man bought Propulsid at a 
local pharmacy. The only warning he received was a drugstore 
printout that said, ``This medication can rarely cause irregular 
heartbeat and fainting,'' and later urged users to ``tell your 
doctor'' if they are taking certain other medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	Quite a difference, noted Propulsid purchaser Larry Sasich of  
the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a new Food and Drug Administration regulation goes  
into effect, letting the government mandate explicit 
consumer-warning brochures, called Medguides, for up to 10 drugs a 
year deemed exceptionally risky. The idea is to tell patients what 
steps can lower their chances of a dangerous side effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two or three drugs, like Propulsid, voluntarily come with  
Medguides today. Instead, consumers usually receive prescription 
information from computer printouts or leaflets distributed by 
drugstores, with no accuracy oversight. The special Medguides, in 
contrast, will be printed by drug manufacturers and attached to 
their products, and contain FDA-specified warnings in laymen's 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	A drug that comes with a Medguide ``gives a signal to consumers  
that this is a product they should really be careful about,'' said 
Nancy Ostrove, FDA's chief of drug information. 
</P>
<P>
	It's part of growing efforts by medical groups to educate  
doctors and patients to use medicine more safely. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 2 million Americans are hospitalized annually from  
drug side effects, and 100,000 die. Some side effects are 
unavoidable or a surprise, but experts say the vast majority of 
prescription-caused deaths are preventable. Education isn't the 
only protection -- they point to efforts such as computers that 
catch risky drug interactions if consumers fill all their 
prescriptions at one pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FDA's new Medguides are controversial.  
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Congress killed a previous FDA attempt to make  
every prescription drug bear a Medguide. Opponents said the FDA was 
interfering in pharmacy practice and that putting high-profile 
warnings even on less risky drugs might scare patients away from 
valuable medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Congress gave drugstores until 2001 to distribute their  
own prescription information voluntarily to 75 percent of 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	A senator introduced a last-minute attempt to block Tuesday's  
new Medguide regulation, saying it violates Congress' intent to 
give voluntary programs a chance. Some pharmacist groups are upset, 
too. Congress, however, has made no move to fight the issue again. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA supporters say the new Medguides are legal because the  
government has the authority to single out risky drugs for special 
warnings. Indeed, the FDA already requires for about 70 drugs 
special ``patient labeling'' such as the fine-print insert that 
comes with birth control pills, but the government seldom forces 
the actual distribution of those labels, as it will with Medguide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Medguide controversy aside, drugstores are distributing more  
information to consumers. A recent FDA survey found about 70 
percent of patients are getting some information beyond what dose 
to take and how often, up from less than half of patients in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The accuracy of those leaflets is not yet known. FDA's first  
formal look at prescription information quality is scheduled for 
this summer. But Public Citizen recently examined 59 leaflets that 
come with prescription painkillers and said just 25 percent 
appropriately warned patients to quit taking the pills if they 
developed symptoms of stomach ulcers, a dangerous side effect of 
painkillers.

<HEADLINE> Arts Chief Wants $50M for Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the National Endowment for the  
Arts asked senators Thursday for an additional $50 million to 
spread his agency's work to underserved areas of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress have complained that NEA grants  
concentrate too heavily on big cities such as New York and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	For the current year, the NEA has $98 million in federal funds.  
President Clinton has requested $150 million for the fiscal year 
beginning Oct. 1. Of that, $50 million would go for a new 
three-year program called ``Challenge America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The first year, 2000, will target funding to communities that  
lack a significant arts presence,'' NEA Chairman Bill Ivey told the 
Senate committee that authorizes NEA funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivey outlined a series of goals for the NEA, starting with arts  
education and including after-school programs. On Wednesday, a 
Justice Department expert on delinquency told an informal group of 
Congress members that pilot after-school arts programs have reduced 
the number of young people getting into serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``Numerous recent studies conclude that children actively  
engaged in music, theater, dance and the visual arts demonstrate 
improved learning ability ... in other subject areas, including 
math and science,'' Ivey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivey's testimony was submitted to the Senate Health, Education,  
Labor and Pensions Committee.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hails Milosevic Indictment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- President Clinton today praised an  
international tribunal's war-crimes indictment of Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic, saying the action ``speaks to the 
world in saying that the cause we are fighting for in Kosovo is 
just.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Briefly leaving his vacation cottage at White Oaks Plantation,  
Clinton said the indictment will help deter future war crimes and 
``make clear to the Serbian people precisely who is responsible for 
this conflict and who is prolonging it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president did not answer questions on whether he can now  
negotiate peace with Milosevic, or whether NATO should pursue an 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke shortly after he issued a written statement that  
cheered the indictment and said NATO's objectives remain unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	He said NATO's airstrikes are exacting a heavy price on  
Milosevic's leadership. ``We see the impact they are having in the 
protests against his policies, the desertions in his army, the 
difficulties his troops in Kosovo are having in maintaining their 
grip on the area,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his earlier statement, Clinton urged other nations to support  
the tribunal's decision and ``cooperate with its efforts to seek 
justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, today  
indicted Milosevic and four top aides on charges of planning and 
carrying out war crimes against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal issued arrest warrants for the four, marking the  
first time an international court has charged a head of state with 
such atrocities. Milosevic could face a life sentence if captured 
and convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of ethnic Albanians are believed to have been slain by  
Serb forces in Kosovo. But the tribunal specifically charged the 
five Serbian leaders with the forced deportation of 740,000 Kosovar 
Albanians and the murder of 340. 
</P>
<P>
	``The objectives of NATO's military effort remain unchanged,''  
Clinton said. ``The Kosovar refugees must be able to go home with 
security and self-government; Serb forces must leave Kosovo; and an 
international security force with NATO at its core must deploy. We 
intend to persist with our efforts until our objectives are 
achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and its NATO allies have stopped short of  
insisting on Milosevic's ouster.

mixture of shredded Gruyere, Swiss and other varieties. 
</P>
<P>
	In Room 114, cheese drips from a ceiling fan. It is draped over  
chairs and the television. It blankets two beds and hangs from the 
overhead light in long strands reaching the floor. It covers an 
ashtray and two glasses. It is spread over the walls and the 
carpet. It nearly covers the blinking red message light of the 
bedside telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	The place smells something like a New York apartment would if a  
party spread were left out overnight ... in August. 
</P>
<P>
	To Cavallaro, this is art.  
</P>
<P>
	He is paying the regular rate of about $100 a night for a suite  
at the Washington Jefferson Hotel and has turned it into a work of 
``installation art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Beautiful,'' Cavallaro sighs after flinging another giant  
measuring cup of the stuff at the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	He compares his art to a love affair or religion and says it has  
even helped him work through issues with his sometimes too-tough 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody asked me: `Why cheese?' I don't know, why not?''  
Cavallaro asks. ``I wouldn't do this if I knew that you wanted 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cavallaro's mother owned a cheese deli in his native Canada and  
his family used to make some of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	His first cheese-covered art was a piece of furniture handed  
down from his dad. Cavallaro returned from lunch one day, looked at 
his father's old armchair -- he had long thought about 
reupholstering it -- and reached for the mozzarella. It was 
liberating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a childish act. I was allowing myself to dirty this  
chair,'' Cavallaro says. ``I guess I finally stood up to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, he got the urge to decorate a hotel room.  
</P>
<P>
	Enter one-time gallery owner Jules Feiler, who once represented  
a guy whose shtick was lying on the floor at parties and letting 
people vacuum him. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first talked to him, I thought he was just another in a  
serious of nuts that have entered my life, but it's not the case,'' 
Feiler says of the cheese guy. ``I really do believe his work is 
genuine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feiler found Bob Lindenbaum, general manager at the Washington  
Jefferson. With his hotel undergoing renovation, Lindenbaum was 
looking for something to draw new customers. He even donated the 
old furniture. The hotel is also responsible for cleanup (read: 
toss out the furniture.) 
</P>
<P>
	When the cheese exhibit ends June 20, Feiler has a comic lined  
up to take over. The guy will live in Room 114 for a month and 
promises to tell jokes to anyone who knocks on his door. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Cavallaro, he hasn't quite gotten the cheese thing out of  
his system. Next up: a taxi, an elevator, maybe even a subway car.

<HEADLINE> Shareholders OK Exxon, Mobil Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Only regulatory approval now stands between Exxon  
and Mobil and their history-making $82.2 billion merger, but 
analysts said consumers shouldn't worry about a possible increase 
at the gas pumps if that occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company ``can't exert undue influence on the retail  
market because most of the major oil companies don't own their own 
retail stations -- they're owned by individuals,'' said Keith 
Petersen of Salomon Smith Barney in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact on consumers will be hardly noticeable,'' agreed  
Michael L. Mayer of Schroder &AMP; Co. ``Gasoline marketing in the U.S. 
is highly competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate meetings Thursday, shareholders of each company  
overwhelmingly approved the marriage, which would produce one of 
the world's largest companies with about $150 billion in combined 
1998 revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would be called Exxon Mobil Corp. and have  
headquarters in Irving, Exxon's current home. Mobil is based in 
Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon's chairman Lee R. Raymond said the combined company will  
be more cost-efficient -- cutting costs by $2.8 billion -- and better 
able to compete with international competitors, including state-run 
oil companies, than would either Exxon or Mobil alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond, who would become chairman of the new company,  
acknowledged that federal regulators could force the sale of some 
gas stations where the two brands compete head to head. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said both nameplates -- the Exxon tiger and Mobil's red  
Pegasus -- would be retained. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators in the United States and Europe must still approve  
the deal, which company officials said they expect by October. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent analysts generally view the merger as benign for  
consumers, even though it would create the world's largest energy 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would expect that the regulators would look at this closely  
... I haven't seen anything yet that would cause a reason for 
concern,'' said Bill Noble, an AAA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the American Petroleum Institute, the new company  
would account for 12 percent of U.S. refining capacity and 7 
percent worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies predicted that the merger will result in the loss  
of 9,000 jobs -- 7 percent of their combined worldwide work force -- 
but admitted that's just an estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even without mergers, there would be layoffs in this  
business,'' said Mobil chairman Lucio Noto, who would become vice 
chairman of the combined company. ``Costs have to come down, people 
have to get more efficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders agreed. More than 99 percent of the shares in Exxon  
were voted in favor of the marriage, as were more than 98 percent 
of Mobil shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon Mobil will have about 48,500 gas stations around the  
world, with roughly a third in the United States, plus exploration 
and production operations worldwide. On a daily basis, the 
companies together produce 2.5 million barrels of oil and 
equivalent amounts of natural gas -- more than the country of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies announced plans to merge in December. Exxon is  
the biggest U.S. oil company and Mobil is No. 2. The merger will 
create the sixth-largest oil producer in the world and the largest 
that is privately owned. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination is part of a consolidation trend in the oil  
industry, which most observers expect will continue. BP-Amoco, 
itself the creation of a 1998 merger between British Petroleum and 
Amoco Corp., has agreed to buy Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron and Texaco are also discussing a merger, though the Wall  
Street Journal reported Thursday that negotiations between the two 
companies are bogging down over a number of issues, including 
control of the combined company.

<HEADLINE>  Pinochet Loses Extradition Block </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet lost a  
bid today to block his extradition to Spain for a possible trial on 
charges he ordered the torture of political opponents during his 
17-year rule. 
</P>
<P>
	High Court Judge Harry Ognall refused to give lawyers for the  
83-year-old general permission to challenge Spain's extradition 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling clears the way for an extradition hearing before the  
magistrate's court, set for June 4. But other aspects of the case 
could still be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish to do all in my power to assure that any necessary  
journey shall be conducted as speedily and as efficiently as the 
justice of the matter and the circumstances of the case permit,'' 
the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	British authorities arrested Pinochet in October in London at  
the request of Spanish Investigative Judge Baltasar Garzon, who 
wants to try the former Chilean leader for human rights abuses 
committed during his 1973-90 regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, aspects of the case have been considered and  
reconsidered in the High Court and the House of Lords, Britain's 
highest court of appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The law lords on March 24 issued a ruling that dramatically  
limited the scope of the Spanish case against Pinochet. The judges 
ruled Pinochet could only face charges of torture and conspiracy to 
torture allegedly committed after December 1988, when Britain 
ratified the International Convention Against Torture. 
</P>
<P>
	Home Secretary Jack Straw, the Cabinet minister who decides  
whether to pass extradition requests onto the British courts, ruled 
April 15 that the remaining charges were sufficiently serious to 
allow the extradition process to carry on. 
</P>
<P>
	Clive Nicholls, a lawyer for Pinochet, returned to court  
Thursday to argue that Straw ``misdirected himself in law and acted 
irrationally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a case where he can pass his duties over to anybody  
else,'' Nicholls said. ``He cannot say, `Well it looks good enough 
to me and they can always sort it out in the courts later on.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Sumption, a lawyer for Straw, said the home secretary  
could only have dismissed the Spanish request ``if it were already 
obvious to him ... that the outcome would be that Sen. Pinochet 
would be discharged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The human rights group, Amnesty International, welcomed the  
judge's ruling, adding that Pinochet's ``right to exhaust all legal 
avenues available to him ... must be upheld, even though they were 
denied to thousands during his rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet remains under 24-hour police guard at a rented mansion  
southwest of London. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean report says 3,197 people disappeared or were  
killed at the hands of Pinochet's secret police after he ousted 
Chile's elected Marxist president, Salvador Allende, in a bloody 
1973 coup.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Needed for Stock Market Talk / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If it wasn't the inflation threat or higher oil  
prices or the uncertainty about Y2K it would be something else. You 
can be certain of that. The stock market needs threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Without them, there would be little to talk about, and stock  
talk and financial advice has become an industry in itself, heard 
morning and night on the air and read about in between. 
</P>
<P>
	Portfolio managers and analysts vie to get views publicized, and  
so are ready to answer calls from the media, knowing that to pose 
as a marketplace scholar is more effective than paying for an ad. 
</P>
<P>
	At the moment, the very height of the market provides excuses  
for fear commentary, and you can hear two opposite and 
contradictory sides of the issue: 
</P>
<P>
	1. Sell now and lock in your gains before other investors with  
big gains unload their holdings and depress prices. 2. Don't miss 
out on the opportunity to buy now before the market advances again. 
</P>
<P>
	Fear is forever present, and fear of inflation is especially  
pervasive, even if supporting evidence is hard to find. Even 
without evidence, however, the fear of it has remained constant for 
the past year, an all-purpose threat to be dredged up by analysts 
when convenient. 
</P>
<P>
	True, oil prices have risen but they remain less than two years  
ago, and supply exceeds demand. With only few exceptions, commodity 
prices have remained low. And labor costs have risen only 
minimally. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, productivity gains continue strong, with companies  
proving that with technology they can produce more efficiently, 
keep prices low, maintain quality, earn solid profits and pay good 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this, hardly a stock market commentary fails to mention  
the inflation threat. 
</P>
<P>
	As the year ages, the Year 2000 computer bug, known as Y2K, is  
likely to become an increasingly larger segment of the fear 
quotient. But, again, many of the fears expressed are based on a 
minimum of hard evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, it is the inability to know in advance and the absence  
of a comparable event in history that generates the worst Y2K 
fears. With uncertainty ruling, the fears range all the way to 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there is Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman  
with the power to nudge interest rates higher and slow the long 
expansion, with attendant consequences for stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan has adroitly threatened to use this club whenever he  
perceives the economy on the verge of becoming, in his view, overly 
exuberant, such as when demand shows signs of overwhelming supply. 
</P>
<P>
	His power is expertly used, or unused. Repeated reminders, as  
recently as last week, that he can use the club is sufficient to 
generate a rise in the fear level without the club ever being used. 
</P>
<P>
	One of these months the chairman will really use that club, but  
by then there likely will be more actual evidence than there seems 
to be now. Until then, the fear will be threat enough.
