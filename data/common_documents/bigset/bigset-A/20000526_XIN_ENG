"Yes, it is the Supreme Court judgment, we have to accept it",
Musharraf said while replying to a question that whether he would
return power to the civilian within the specified timeframe.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court in its verdict this month on the petitions
challenging the validity of the October 12 action by the Army had
given three years to the current government for holding general
elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf said his Government would try its best to
fulfill its agenda within the stipulated period of three years. If
there was something yet leftover, the Government would think over
it at that time.

<HEADLINE> China Loses to Yugoslavia in Soccer Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China conceded one goal in each
half to lose 2-0 to Yugoslavia in an international soccer friendly
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The hosts put a lot pressure on the visitors' defense and
created several scoring chances early in the game. Fifteen
minutes into the first half, Chinese strike Su Maozhen broke away
into the box but his slap shot just sailed past the pole.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, another Chinese striker Hao Haidong also
missed a golden chance with a feeble shot.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavians broke the deadlock on their first shot in the
20th minute. Chinese goalkeeper Ou Chuliang hit a Yugoslavian
pass to the feet of Kezman Mateja and the Yugoslavian strike's
slap shot beat the Chinese goalie out of balance.
</P>
<P>
Velibor Milutinovic, China's Yugoslavian head coach, replaced
several starters after the game resumed while Yugoslavian stars
Miyatovic Predrag and Kovacevic Darko also joined in.
</P>
<P>
In the 70th minute, Kovacevic, who played for the Italian
powerhouse Juventus, scored on a precise pass set up by Miyatovic
and sealed the victory for the visitors.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with my players' performance in the game. They
were very disciplined and they did what they could in the match,"
Milutinovic told reporters after the match.
</P>
<P>
"We should not be sad just due to the defeat. Considering that
Yugoslavia is a high-standard crack side, I think we can accept
the result," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's manager Boskov Vujadin praised his compatriot who
shoulders China's hope of making 2002 World Cup finals. "Velibor
is a good coach and the Chinese team has undergone a lot of
improvement under his guide. I believe that China has a good
chance of qualifying for the 2002 World Cup finals."

<HEADLINE> Enhanced Heritage Protection Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Enhanced protection of the world's
natural and cultural heritage is of crucial importance, according
to the National Working Conference on World Heritage which
concluded here today.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three of China's scenic spots and historic sites, such
as the Great Wall and the Palace Museum, have been put on the
World Heritage list since 1987, said Zhang Xuezhong, secretary
general of the Chinese National Commission for UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
These sites have high historic, cultural and scientific values,
and China has done a lot of work for their protection, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang said, it will be a huge and long-term task to
protect and manage them properly.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day conference here, participants exchanged
experience on heritage protection and explored ways to solve the
existing problems.
</P>
<P>
The conference was co-sponsored by the China National
Commission for UNESCO, the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage, and the Ministry of Construction.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Visits Literature Archives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
visited the new Modern Chinese Literature Archives here today and
expressed his congratulations on the opening of the museum.
</P>
<P>
Located in north Beijing, the archives is a major cultural
project that has received support from the central government and
the president, who is also the general secretary of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee and chairman of the Central
Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Ba Jin, president of the Chinese Writers' Association,
wrote to Jiang asking if a new facility could be built to house
the impressive collections of China's contemporary literature.
Jiang publicly backed the project and inscribed the name of the
museum.
</P>
<P>
The museum is now China's largest modern literature research
center and library where all literary works and reviews published
since 1911 are stored.
</P>
<P>
The facility will serve as a literature museum, library,
archives and center for literature research and exchange. It holds
some 300,000 books, and when the third-phase construction of the
facility is completed, it will be the largest of its kind in world
today.
</P>
<P>
During today's visit, Jiang showed much interest in the
displays. He also instructed the staff there to manage the
achieves properly and play an active role in promoting the
development of Chinese literature.
</P>
<P>
Li Lanqing, Vice-Premier and also a Standing Committee member
of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee, also joined Jiang in today's visit.

ADDIS ABABA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said Thursday that its
war against Eritrea will not come to an end before the latter
withdraws its troops from Ethiopian territory.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Eritrea is
still " occupying large chunks of territory in the eastern and
northeastern part of Ethiopia".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement noted that Ethiopia has no desire to
remain in Eritrean territory that it holds temporally for the
purpose of military expediency.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia's commitment to the peace process under the
Organization of African Unity auspices is firm and principled,"
the statement said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Sticks to Two-Way Breakup of Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department, in
a filing to a federal judge Friday, has stuck to its initial
proposal to split software giant Microsoft into two companies.
</P>
<P>
The new document is the final version of the government's
proposed remedy to curb the company's business practices, which U.
S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found to be in wide
violation of the federal antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
During a hearing on the issue Wednesday, Jackson broached the
possibility of a three-way breakup when he questioned the
government on its proposal. He ordered the government to submit a
revised proposal Friday.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft will have 48 hours to reply and expects to file
comments on the form of the proposal by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new plan would keep every element of the government's
original plan intact: Microsoft would be sliced into two companies;
one would sell the dominant Windows operating system, while the
other would sell everything else Microsoft produces, including its
lucrative Office suite products and its Internet services.
</P>
<P>
The document makes minor changes to the one filed last month.
It proposes to lengthen from 30 to 90 days the period of time
before a final judgment would take effect.
</P>
<P>
It also would narrow the group of major stockholders who would
be barred from holding stock in both companies. The original plan
would have applied to those who own more than 3 percent of
Microsoft stock; the revision proposes to raise that threshold to
5 percent.
</P>
<P>
On April 3, Jackson found Microsoft in violation of the federal
antitrust law. He said the company illegally used predatory
tactics against competitors to maintain its monopoly in personal
computer operating systems. The government's two-way breakup
proposal was submitted as a remedy to the actions found illegal by
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft, which plans to appeal the ruling, insists its
actions were not illegal and that the government has no basis for
its proposal.

<HEADLINE> Peru To Hold Run-Off Election on May 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian National Elections Jury (
JNE) Friday ratified May 28 as the date of the run-off election,
calling on the residents to vote.
</P>
<P>
The JNE made the date official with the publication of its
resolution this Friday of its resolution in the official newspaper
"El Peruano."
</P>
<P>
Opposition presidential candidate Alejandro Toledo, of the Peru
Posible coalition, conditioned his participation in the second
round to a postponement of the date, which was opposed by his
rival, President Albero Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
The JNE considered inappropriate in its earlier resolution to
postpone the date for the second round election.
</P>
<P>
The JNE also rejected the nullity recourse presented by some
citizens.
</P>
<P>
The electoral organization called on the citizens to emit their
"free, spontaneous, and secret vote" for the election of the next
president and vice presidents of Peru.
</P>
<P>
The JNE said that during the last simulacra of the computation
program of the Electoral Processes National Office (OPEN) its
correct functioning was ascertained at the central seat of the
organization, as well as in the Electoral Processes Decentralized
Offices (ODPE) offices, at a national level.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy Hails Optional Protocol on Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. special
representative for children and armed conflict, Olara Otunnu,
Friday welcomed the adoption by the U.N. General Assembly of a new
treaty which prohibits the compulsory recruitment of children
under 18 and their participation in combat, and urged Member
States to ratify the agreement as swiftly as possible.
</P>
<P>
"A momentous step has been taken in the global effort to
eradicate the use of children as soldiers," Otunnu said. "This
outcome is a victory for children exposed to cynical exploitation
in situations of armed conflict."
</P>
<P>
"Now concrete action must follow -- starting with the speedy
signature and ratification by U.N. Member States of this landmark
agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The key provisions of the Optional Protocol to the Convention
on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed
Conflicts, adopted here Thursday, are:
</P>
<P>
-- States are to take "all feasible measures" to ensure that
members of their armed forces who are under 18 do not take a
direct part in hostilities and no one under 18 years is
compulsorily recruited;
</P>
<P>
-- In terms of voluntary enlistment, the treaty raises the
minimum age to at least 16 and includes specific and verifiable
safeguards, including the provision of reliable proof of age and
the informed consent of both volunteer and parents;
</P>
<P>
-- As for insurgency groups and rebels, the treaty prohibits
the recruitment or participation of anyone under 18 "under any
circumstances."
</P>
<P>
"We must now organize more effectively to monitor adherence by
parties in conflict to their commitments and obligations to
protect children -- leaning over more urgently on armed groups
that are abusing children as combatants right now," Otunnu said.
</P>
<P>
"The international community must make it clear that all
warring parties will be held to account if they fail to comply
with this new international standard," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Optional Protocol will be open for signature by Member
States on June 5-9 in New York, at a special session on gender
equality, known as "Beijing + 5." Thereafter, it will be available
for signature at a social development summit in Geneva on June 26-
30 and at the Millennium Summit in New York on September 6-8.

NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Friday restated his government's firm adherence to the "one China"
policy, while meeting with the visiting Chinese State Councillor
Wang Zhongyu.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan government will not change the stand despite the recent
leadership shift in Taiwan, said Moi at Nakuru state house in the
country's central Rift Valley Province.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Kenya would continue to support China in its
just cause to achieve national unification.

given by the Chinese government, adding Kenya had benefited
greatly from most of the assistance projects with the Moi
International Sports Center as an example.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Wang Zhongyu conveyed the best regards of
President Jiang to Moi. He also expressed his hope that the two
countries' good cooperation in international affairs and trade
would further expand.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Russia Calls for Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Ahmed Necdet Sezer
on Friday received Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who
delivered a special message from Russian President Vladimir Putin,
according to a statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
During his first days in office, Sezer sent a letter to Putin,
calling for Russian cooperation in both the Caucasus and Central
Asia in order to ensure stability in the two regions which are of
their mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry statement did not reveal the contents of
Putin's message. But it is widely believed that the letter would
favorably respond the suggestions by Sezer.
</P>
<P>
Sezer assumed the post of Turkey's 10th President on May 16
after Putin was elected the second Russian President on March 26.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov is expected to meet with Deputy Prime Minister
Husamettin Ozakan and Defense Minister Sabahattin Cakmakoglu on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Issues to be discussed during his stay in Ankara reportedly
range from bilateral relations, particularly energy cooperation, to
regional politics, including the Caucasus situation and Middle East
peace.
</P>
<P>
Russia is Turkey's major oil and natural gas supplier. In
addition to the existing pipeline via the Balkans, Russia is
constructing a new pipeline -- the Blue Stream project, which will
run under the Black Sea bringing Russian gas to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov is no stranger to Turkey. He visited Ankara last
February as special envoy of Putin, who was then acting Russian
President and Prime Minister.

<P>
ANKARA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) President James
Wolfensohn urged the Turkish government to move ahead with its
banking reform, Turkish Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn, who was paying a three-day visit to Turkey starting
Wednesday, the first visit for a WB chief in a decade, also called
on the country to catch up with digital technology.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said Turkey had the capacity, desire and position for
its economic development.
</P>
<P>
"We (the WB) will continue to support Turkey with its economic
program which will last through the next three years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The WB is sponsoring a 760-million-U.S. dollar Economic Reform
Loan (ERL) to support Turkey's structural reforms, covering the
financial sector, anti-inflation, public spending management,
social security, agriculture, telecommunication and energy
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Johannes Linn, deputy WB president in charge of European
affairs, said on Friday that if Turkey implements its economic
program successfully, it will become the most powerful country of
its region.
</P>
<P>
Linn, who accompanied Wolfensohn, said the World Bank was ready
to provide support to Turkey to reach its economic targets.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of students from the Golan
Heights studying in the University of Damascus staged here on
Friday a sit-in to show solidarity with Syrian detainees held in
the Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which coincided with another by the families of the
detainees, was staged in front of premises of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
The strikers handed a written complaint to the ICRC office
director Claud Foila to be delivered to the Geneva-based ICRC's
Chairman. They appealed to the ICRC chief, Jakob Kellenberger, to
seek immediate release of the detainees and improve their living
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The letter complained of the conditions in the Israeli jails,
especially the Shatta concentration camp, and claimed that the
detainees are being tortured, denied of visits and medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen Syrian detainees in Israeli prisons started a hunger-
strike on May 18.
</P>
<P>
The detainees sent a message to Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed
Mustafa Miro last week. The Syrian cabinet vowed to do its best to
defend the wellbeings of the detainees.

<HEADLINE> CBI To Cut UK Growth Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) has cut its forecasts for manufacturing growth,
saying that prospects for the sector remained uncertain despite
recent falls in the pound.
</P>
<P>
Its monthly industrial survey found that for the first time in
almost a year a majority of manufacturers expected output to fall.
</P>
<P>
Output will grow just 0.5 percent this year, the CBI said, in a
massive revision from its February forecast of 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also shaved 0.1 percent off its forecast for GDP growth,
which it now believes will come in at 3 percent. It said there was
a risk that the final figure could be even lower.
</P>
<P>
The continued strength of sterling against the euro will still
keep export growth weak, the CBI said. The pound Thursday hit a
fresh six-year low of 1.4676 U.S. dollars against the dollar;
against the euro it fell to a two-month low of 61.89p.
</P>
<P>
Nine out of 10 manufacturing firms are being forced to peg or
cut prices to cope with ferocious competitive pressures and the
impact of the strong pound.
</P>
<P>
Only 8 percent of the 1061 manufacturers responding to the
survey said that they would be able to raise prices over the next
four months, against 60 percent who said they would remain the
same and 29 percent who were planning to announce reductions.
</P>
<P>
Kate Barker, CBI chief economist, said: "The strength of
sterling is forcing manufacturers to cut back further on
investment plans, and if investment declines as expected, this
could constrain growth over the long term."
</P>
<P>
In its overall forecasts for the economy over the next 18
months, the CBI said Britain would remain a two-speed nation, with
growth of 3 percent this year and 2.6 percent in 2001 driven by
the strength of consumer spending and kept in check by the
weakness of exports.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Governor Shrugs Off S. Africa's High Crime Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Governor of the U.S
Illinois State George Ryan shrugged off South Africa's high crime
rate on Friday, saying it should not deter companies from trading
with or investing in this country.
</P>
<P>
"We have these problems in the U.S. South Africa is not
unique," he said in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's government understands that high crime
contributes to negative sentiment abroad and is doing its best to
bring it under control, said Ryan, who arrived in South Africa
with a 100-member trade delegation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ryan praised the way the ruling African National Congress has
run the country since taking power in all-race elections in 1994,
pointing to declining inflation and interest rates and steady
economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Army Warned Not to Dabble in Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Prime Minister
Pakalitha Mosisili on Friday advised the Lesotho Defense Force not
to dabble in politics, according to South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the final joint parade of forces of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) and the Lesotho army at
military headquarters in Maseru, Mosisili said "politics are for
politicians".
</P>
<P>
He said the business of soldiers is to provide security for all
and to protect the constitution of the country.
</P>
<P>
"You have to demonstrate to the SADC and to the entire world
that you are a new, dependable and professional defense force,"
the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He warned the Lesotho Defense Force not to allow anybody to
derail the program of restructuring and professionalizing the
army.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili extended thanks to Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe
for conducting a training program for the Lesotho army.
</P>
<P>
SADC troops entered Lesotho in September 1998 to restore
stability after an army mutiny. A contingent of the SADC troops
remained in Lesotho to maintain order while others were involved
in training Lesotho soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili said the SADC training program has enabled the armies
of Lesotho, Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe to get to know one
another better.
</P>
<P>
The knowledge all four countries gained from the SADC training
program will benefit the region since their respective armies will
be ready to tackle any challenge or threat, he added.

<P>
LUANDA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- South African army chief of staff
General Siph Nyanda confirmed here on Friday the sending of troops
to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to join the UN
forces, according to the official news agency Angop.
</P>
<P>
General Nyanda said before leaving Luanda that his country had
been requested by the United Nations to provide technical groups
with a view to redeploy UN forces in that country, adding that
South Africa is ready to provide all the support the UN might ask
for.
</P>
<P>
The South African high ranking officer said the current
situation in the DRC is still very worrying and this might explain
the UN invitation.
</P>
<P>
He added that the South Africans will do their best to
condignly fulfil the mission they were asked for, so that the UN
role becomes a reality in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Nyanda has been in Angola for five days, during which he met
his Angolan counterpart General Joao de Matos.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the civil conflicts in DRC, Angola and South
Africa have different viewpoints. Angola has sent troops to its
north neighbor to help the government troops fight the rebels
supported by foreign forces, while South Africa insisted on the
peaceful settlement to the conflicts.

<HEADLINE> At Least 120 Refugees Enter Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 120 refugees from Rwanda
and Burundi entered Mozambique through the northern province of
Niassa this year, local authorities said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a source in the Niassa provincial government,
refugees coming to Niassa were initially accommodated at an
improvised centre in Lichinga, the provincial capital, under the
care of the government and religious authorities, and were later
transferred to Maputo.
</P>
<P>
"We have at least a dozen refugees here in Lichinga who are
engaged in informal trade or other activities because they
declined to be transferred to Boane, Maputo," the government
source said.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no plan yet to transfer them anywhere, since
"they are not any threat to security in the province and are
complying with the country's laws," the same source said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR) estimated that there are about 200 refugees in the country
at the moment, compared with about 50 at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Most of these refugees came from the war-torn Great Lakes
region.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNHCR, about 500,000 U.S. dollars were costed
annually to provide food, education and health care to the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR has been promoting small agricultural projects and
other productive activities to help ensure self-sufficiency to the
refugees.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Minister Backs Occupation of Vacant Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Home Affairs Minister
Dumiso Dabengwa threw his weight on Friday towards the on-going
occupation of vacant buildings in Bulawayo by the Affirmative
Action Group (AAG), saying they have the right to demonstrate as
long as they do not violate the law.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters soon after touring some of the vacant
buildings in Bulawayo, the second largest city in the country, the
minister said the AAG has a democratic right to put pressure on
the matter until they are satisfied that their protests have been
heard, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"So far I am satisfied with the way they have done it," he
said, adding, "Their action has been within the laws of this
country and after holding discussions with them, they have told
me they do not have any intentions of taking any building by
force."
</P>
<P>
He dismissed recent reports that the occupations had been done
by force saying he had checked with the police to find out
whether these had been complaints from owners of those buildings.
</P>
<P>
"The police have told me they have not received such complaints
and the AAG has also assured me they will do everything within
the law until their concerns are properly resolved," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would soon meet with the Bulawayo City Council to
discuss if measures could be taken to ensure that the issue of
vacant buildings was resolved.
</P>
<P>
"This situation cannot continue in our city where we have over
60 buildings empty and yet we have queues of people in need of
both office space and residential accommodation," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
AAG regional chairman Sam Ncube said the pressure group would
go ahead with their demonstrations and would maintain their
radical stance to see to it that the economy of the country was
properly shared between blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
The former freedom fighters have occupied about 1,000 white
farms since February, this year.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Meeting on Biodiversity Concludes in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Sun Huixia
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth Meeting of the Conference
of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity concluded
here on Friday after adopting decisions that will guide
international action on biological diversity over the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
A highlight of the two-week conference was the signing of the
Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety by 64 governments plus the
European Community to regulate trans-border movement of
genetically modified products.
</P>
<P>
"Biotechnology has the potential to boost agricultural
production over the coming decades far more dramatically than even
the Green Revolution of the 1970s," said Executive Director Klaus
Toepfer of the United Nations Environment Program at the
headquarters in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
However, the official warned that "without effective
safeguards, there is a risk that genetically modified organisms
could enter the environment and upset the natural ecological
balance."
</P>
<P>
"The Biosafety Protocol is therefore one of the Convention's
most important tools for promoting the conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a UNEP report, the nature's services, such as
flood control and air purification, are worth some 36 trillion
U.S. dollars a year, and 40 percent of the economy of the
developing world is directly based on biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
But humanity is destroying and weakening most of the
ecosystems. If the current trends are not curbed, some 34,000
plants and 5,200 animal species including one in eight of the
world's bird species will face extinction, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The international meeting, which gathered some 1,500 delegates
from 156 countries, has also launched a new international program
for reviving the natural environment of the world's dry lands,
which are home to many of the world's most impoverished people but
severely threatened due to climate change, drought and human
activities.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reviewed and strengthened the existing cooperative
programs on agricultural, freshwater, forest and marine and
coastal ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
A special emphasis was placed on sustainable tourism. As one of
the world's fastest growing industries, tourism accounted for some
443 billion U.S. dollars of income in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the conservation and sustainable use of
biodiversity, the conference also sought to ensure access to
genetic resources under the principle of a fair sharing of the
benefits resulting from exploiting these resources.
</P>
<P>
The meeting established a Working Group to consider draft
guidelines and other issues in the area of genetic resources. The
eventual result is very likely to be an international legal regime
on access and benefit sharing, although this is still a few years
away.
</P>
<P>
Decisions were also made to encourage scientific and technical
cooperation, attract more financial resources, protect traditional
knowledge, strengthen the Global Taxonomy Initiative and address
the problem of alien invasive species.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Economic Growth Not Enough: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The economic growth rate of
less than 4 percent is not enough for South Africa to lead the
rest of Africa out of the difficulties it is facing, said World
Bank's senior economist Jeffrey Lewis on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by South African Press Association as saying here
at a Bureau for Economic Research conference that although South
Africa's economic prospects are better than before, there is still
no reason for major celebration.
</P>
<P>
Some of South Africa's growth is due to "international good
luck" with the U.S. economy riding its longest post-war expansion,
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the economist, South Africa's economic growth
projections are still lower than the averages of both the world
and other developing countries, which are expected to be 3.9
percent and 5.1 percent annually respectively over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that South Africa needs to answer the fundamental
question why it is unable to get growth out of the zero to 4
percent basis band.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China's major mass organizations
gathered here today to voice their strong support for the
government's recent statement on the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
They called on the Taiwan authorities to size up the situation,
go with the historical tide, and embrace the one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued on May 20 by the Taiwan Work Office of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the
Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, expounded on the
mainland's position on the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Junjiu, vice-president of the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions, said at a forum here that no compromises or
concessions will be allowed on the question of the one-China
principle.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate reunification of the motherland conforms to the
fundamental interests of the Chinese nation. Trade unions on both
sides of the Taiwan Straits should work together to see that
reunification happens as soon as possible, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Gu Xiulian, vice-president of the All-China Women's Federation
(ACWF), said that the one-China principle is the touchstone of
whether or not the Taiwan authorities will continue to promote "
independence" for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan new leader sticks to the Lee Teng-hui path, the
cross-Straits relations will undoubtedly suffer, and so will the
interests of the entire Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Bayinqolu, secretary of Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Youth League, said that the Taiwan leader's evasive
attitude toward the one-China principle showed that he refuses to
accept it.
</P>
<P>
Young people on both sides of the Straits should join hands in
opposing "Taiwan independence" and in striving for the
revitalization of the entire Chinese nation, Bayinqolu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, was very pleased to
learn that Hong Kong's economy was recovering very well as the GDP
growth for the first quarter was an impressive 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that our economy will grow to 6 percent for
the whole of the year," Tung said Friday evening, attributing the
economic recovery to the hard work and collective effort of all
the people in Hong Kong over the last two years or so.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong people would continue to be very watchful,
particularly of the changing external environment, the recent
interest rate increase in the United States and possible future
increases that would affect the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that while Hong Kong's economy was growing, there
were certain sectors of the community who had not yet benefited
from this, such as those who were still unemployed and those who
were at the lower income market.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said the government had been taking
positive steps to help those affected by economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Legislative Council just approved Friday a
budget of 480 million HK dollars (about 61.5 million U.S. dollars)
for various training programs such as the on-going "Youth Pre-
Employment Training Program," the new "On-the-Job Training Program
" and "Information Technology Training."

<HEADLINE> Indian Navy on Alert for Possible Evacuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- India's Eastern Naval Flotilla,
conducting exercises in the Bay of Bengal off Jaffna's coast, is
on a six- to 12-hour alert for undertaking, if required, a
humanitarian evacuation from Jaffna, Sri Lanka, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Besides a large number of Mager Class landing ships, the Indian
Navy has hired a large number of merchant ships to carry out, if
directed, evacuation of nearly 45,000 Sri Lankan troops and
civilians from Jaffna, the PTI quoted "highly-placed navy sources"
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Jaffna peninsula has recently been the scene of fierce
fighting between Sri Lankan government troops and rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which has been trying to take
back its former stronghold.
</P>
<P>
The sources said it is very difficult to quantify how much time
it will take to evacuate people from Jaffna, adding, "With air
force help the task would be much easier."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indian Air Force sources Friday denied reports that
ground attack MiG-23 and MiG-27 fighter aircraft have been moved
to air bases in the south, the PTI reported.

<HEADLINE> Severe Heat Wave Grips Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A severe heat wave has gripped
Pakistan as the maximum temperature touched the 50 degrees Celsius
mark in several areas in the southern part of the country Friday.
</P>
<P>
The heat wave in southern Punjab, upper Sindh and adjoining
areas of Balochistan has pushed the day's temperature by eight to
nine degrees above normal for the month of May, a meteorologist
told the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
The mercury rocketed to 50 degrees Celsius in Jaccobabad,
Larkana and Sibi in Punjab Province Friday while the temperature
in most of other parts of the South Asian country remained well
above 40 degrees.
</P>
<P>
According to the meteorological data of Pakistan, normally the
50 degree mark is touched only once or twice in June while
recording of such a high temperature in May is unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
The heat wave conditions are likely to continue during the next
24 hours as dry weather is expected over most of the country, said
the meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, no significant change is expected in the drought-hit
areas of Sindh and Balochistan over the next few days and the
rising temperatures will only create more problems for the
residents there.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Durable-Goods Orders Fall Sharply in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- New orders to U.S. factories for
big-ticketed manufactured goods in April fell 6.4 percent, the
biggest decrease in more than eight years, the Commerce Department
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a second report, the Commerce Department said Americans'
incomes rose a brisk 0.7 percent in April, while their spending
went up 0.4 percent, the second straight month in which income
growth outpaced spending increases.
</P>
<P>
The bigger-than-expected plunge in orders for durable goods,
items expected to last at least three years, left orders in April
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 205.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
April's decrease in durable-goods orders, the steepest since
December 1991, followed a 4.5 percent rise in March, the first
increase this year.
</P>
<P>
Last month's performance mostly reflected a record 20.1 percent
decline in orders for electronics and electrical equipment,
including semiconductors, circuit boards and home appliances. In
March, orders for the electronics and electrical equipment rose 8.
9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Orders for transportation equipment fell 6.7 percent in April,
following a 4.5 percent rise the month before. All components of
the sector decreased, but weakened demand for cars and auto parts
led the way.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile transportation sector, durable-goods
orders fell 6.4 percent, the largest drop since July 1989.
</P>
<P>
In the consumer income and spending report, the 0.7 percent
rise in personal income, which includes wages, interest and
government benefits, was slightly stronger than the 0.6 percent
increase many analysts were predicting.
</P>
<P>
The 0.4 percent increase in spending in April was right on
target with many analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
In March, income grew by 0.7 percent, while spending went up 0.
6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the personal savings rate, savings as a percentage
of after-tax income, rose to 0.7 percent in April, an improvement
from the 0.4 percent increase posted the month before.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending on durable-goods, such as cars, fell 0.1
percent in April, up from a 1.3 percent decline. Spending on
nondurables, such as food, rose 0.1 percent, down from a 1 percent
increase in March.

<HEADLINE> NGO Forum to End Discussion on Role of U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) are scheduled to end a five-day forum Friday
afternoon at the United Nations headquarters in New York aimed at
discussion of the role of the world body in the 21st century and
numerous problems throughout the globe.
</P>
<P>
The forum is expected to issue a declaration at the end of the
event, sources close to the forum said here.
</P>
<P>
The forum, with the main theme "the role of the United Nations
in the 21st century," is divided into six sub-themes -- peace and
security, elimination of poverty, human rights, sustainable
development and the environment, globalization, and strengthening
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 representatives from NGOs worldwide, including
China, attended the forum.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony Monday, U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan said that the world has changed rapidly with
some billions of people left behind and called for efforts to do
these people a favor out of globalization.
</P>
<P>
In April, Annan unveiled a "millennium report" on the role of
the United Nations in the new century. The April report and the
report to be adopted at the forum will set the agenda for a summit
of the world body slated for this fall.

<HEADLINE> British Marine Commandos Take Over S.Leone Airport: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of British marine commandos
had taken over defense of Sierra Leone's international airport
from British paratroopers, a Reuters report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
After the marines were deployed around Lungi airport, Sierra
Leonean government troops continued to advance beyond the
strategic Rogberi Junction, 87 kilometers northeast of the capital
Freetown, towards the rebel stronghold of Lunsar, the report
quoted a British spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the situation was "reasonably quiet" with no
reports of new fighting.
</P>
<P>
"There are no great signs of activity. Obviously there have
been isolated outbreaks," Lieutenant Commander Tony Cramp
reportedly said by telephone from Freetown.
</P>
<P>
"The indications are the government forces are continuing their
advance from Rogberi Junction to Lunsar," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commander said the British marines formally took over from
paratroopers at 1000 GMT at a brief ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"They are fully deployed in Lungi and around Aberdeen Peninsula,
" he said, referring to the airport and western coastal tip of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
The report said British paratroopers were due back at their
base near London over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Giant Statue of Mitterrand Inaugurated in Northern French Commune </HEADLINE>

<P>
PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A 3.8-meter high giant statue
representing the head and chest of former French President
Francois Mitterrand was inaugurated recently in a commune in Pas-
de-Calais in northern France.
</P>
<P>
The statue, designed by sculptor Bruno Maillard and made of
rock with a cost of 163,525 francs (22,700 U.S. dollars), was
inaugurated on May 10, the 19th anniversary of the election of
Mitterrand, at a residence area also named after the former
president.
</P>
<P>
Because of its great size, the statue has drawn criticism from
some local residents and elected deputies of the commune called
Outreau.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Figaro said that the statue is such an attraction
that map drawers will have to mark a turning point there to avoid
traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
The mayor of the commune, Jean-Marie Francois, is known for his
zealous admiration of Mitterrand, who was France's president from
1981 to 1995.

<HEADLINE> France Expresses Concern Over Peruvian Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- France on Friday expressed concern
over the situation in Peru where an opposition candidate of the
approaching presidential election refused to join a run-off vote
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation has caused legitimate concern of France," said
French Foreign Ministry Assistant Spokesman Francois Rivasseau.
</P>
<P>
The opposition presidential candidate, Alejandro Toledo, has
called on his supporters to boycott the run-off vote to protest
the lack of transparency and fairness in the elections.
</P>
<P>
After Peru's National Electoral Jury, the supreme judicial
authority supervising the election, refused to postpone the run-
off vote, observers from the Organization of American States have
pulled out of Peru.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that President Alberto Fujimori, 61, will
be re-elected on Sunday for a third five-year presidential term
because of Toledo's refusal to compete.

<HEADLINE> China's Rural Enterprises Take on New Look: Survey (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The name "Wenzhou" used to be
synonymous with fake and shoddy goods made by rural enterprises
and private business in the city in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
But after years of regulatory efforts by the government, many
of these firms are now turning out brand-name products.
</P>
<P>
And in northwest China's province of Shaanxi, more than 3000
rural factories had to be shut down to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
These were just two of the many stories told here today by
lawmakers of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee who recently spent two weeks in eight provinces to check
out how well the rural enterprise law is working.
</P>
<P>
"Rural enterprises are shaking off their tarnished image as
producers of fake and shoddy goods and polluters," said Gao Dezhan,
chairman of the NPC Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
Share-holding and listed rural enterprises featuring hi-tech
products are mushrooming in the developed coastal areas in China,
and in inland areas, though less developed, many rural enterprises
taking advantage of local resources and of their unique
characteristics have emerged en masse, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
In Zhejiang Province, two rural enterprises merged two decades-
old, State-owned located in the capital city of Hangzhou, and
turned them into profit-makers.
</P>
<P>
Rural enterprises in coastal areas of Zhejiang and Shandong are
no longer small family businesses, but have been transformed into
share-holding companies. Their production value accounts for more
than 40 percent of the local portion of gross domestic value,
lawmakers said.

<HEADLINE> China's Rural Enterprises Take on New Look: Survey (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While in inland areas, where the percentage ranges from 10
percent to 30 percent, rural enterprises are embarking on a
healthy track, keen on improving product quality and
environmentally-friendly production, they said.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises have also become a driving force behind
China's rural economy. Statistics show that in 1999, China had 20.
71 million township enterprises employing more than 120 million
rural workers. These enterprises had a combined added value of
over 2.48 trillion yuan (298.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
China enacted the law on rural enterprises in 1997 to protect
their interests and prod their development. The inspection tours
from May 8 to 22 spanned western provinces and a municipality of
Shaanxi and Chongqing to eastern Shandong and Liaoning provinces.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers said that many rural enterprises have been illegally
overcharged by local government bodies, and are not allowed to
enjoy some of the preferential policies provided for by the law,
and some enterprises failed to meet standards of production and
service.
</P>
<P>
"Such problems should addressed earnestly by the central
government," said Buhe, head of the inspection teams and chairman
of the NPC Standing Committee, at the meeting today.
</P>
<P>
"A fair competition arena should be provided for rural
enterprises, so as to bring their role into full play to boost the
rural economy and improve the livelihood of farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rural and agricultural structural adjustment and the
development of the country's western region, both key State
strategies under implementation, will create further development
potential for China's rural enterprises, he said.

<HEADLINE> One Killed, Two Still Missing in Chemical Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed, two more
remain missing, and 17 were injured after an explosion at a
private chemical plant in northeast China's Liaoning Province
early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Six of the victims, including the fatally injured and two
missing persons, are employees of the Xinxing Material Chemical
Factory in Taizihe of Liaoyang city of northeast China's Liaoning
Province. Others are customers and employees of nearby factories.
</P>
<P>
All workshops in the factory were destroyed when a chemical-
filled barrel exploded. The explosion also caused a leak of stored
nitric acid and sulfuric acid which lasted several hours.
</P>
<P>
According to police reports, the private factory was illegally
making nitrobenzene products in a downtown area. The owner
disappeared after the accident, police said.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary investigation, the accident was
caused when workers, ignoring a broken temperature gauge,
continued to add chemicals to the barrel.
</P>
<P>
The explosion resulted in electric outages at several nearby
factories and the chemical leak contaminated a local field. No
immediate property damage estimate was available.
</P>
<P>
All of the injured were sent to hospital and are reported in
good condition.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hails Israeli Withdrawal as Victory for Islamic Resistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei has stated that the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon
was a victory of the Islamic resistance in Lebanon over "the
usurper Israeli enemy", the Islamic Republic News Agency said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulation message to the Lebanese nation, government
and Islamic resistance groups, Khamenei said, "this victory
revealed that the solution to the bullying and atrocities of the
usurper Zionists (Israelis) is only in the logic of resistance."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese nation owes its victory to the brave resistance of
Hezbollah and other Islamic resistance forces and "this is a great
and unprecedented phenomenon filled with lessons," the message
said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops completed their withdrawal from south Lebanon
under the cover of darkness early Wednesday morning, ending 22
years of occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of the conservative Guardians Council of
Iran Ayatollah Jannati said Friday that the ouster of Israelis from
south Lebanon was a proof that they yield only to pressure.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Friday prayers congregation on Tehran university
campus, Jannati underlined that in confrontation with any power,
there is no alternative for the weaker nation, but to hold out and
fight back to the end like the Lebanese Hezbollah, which has been
spearheading a fight against the Israelis for two decades with
Iran's support.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Chooses to Stay Out of New Iranian Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian president Hashemi
Rafsanjani has announced that he would not take up his seat in the
new Majlis (parliament) which is to convene on Saturday, a decision
both surprising and expected.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted a Rafsanjani's statement to the nation as
saying Friday that he decided to withdraw from the slate of
legislators
elected to the sixth parliament on February 18 when reformers
allied to President Mohammad Khatami won an overwhelming victory
over the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate those who voted for me and I respect those who did
not," Rafsanjani said in the statement. "I entered the election
race to try to protect national unity and I withdraw now for the
same reason," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's decision was rather surprising, as it was announced
only two days ahead of the formal inauguration of the new
parliament. And the conservative Guardians Council (GC) has done
all it could in the past few months to ensure his position in the
new legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Initial vote count in Tehran constituency showed that Rafsanjani
ranked the last in the 30-member winners list. But after three
recounts of partial votes, insisted and supervised by the GC, his
ranking was hoisted to the 20th, which was unprecedented and
sparked complaints from the people, especially reformers.
</P>
<P>
Final results in Tehran, confirmed by the GC last Saturday after
a three-month delay, showed reformers won 26 seats. The
conservatives got only two, including one for Rafsanjani. Another
two seats are to be decided in a re-competition later on.
</P>
<P>
As the most prominent conservative figure to win a seat in the
290-seat parliament, and with the out-of-the-way help of the
conservative GC, Rafsanjani should have taken the post and try to
get the key post of parliament speaker, as wished by the
conservatives, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
So, his decision to quit was rather surprising and might have
wasted all the efforts the conservative hardliners had done to
support him, they added.
</P>
<P>
However, Rafsanjani's decision was also expected to most of the
people, because he had hinted that he would rather keep the post of
chairman of the powerful State Expediency Council (SEC), they
noted.
</P>
<P>
As an arbitration body, the SEC, together with the GC, has great
power in restricting the parliament's bills. So analysts say by
staying out of the parliament, Rafsanjani actually poses a more
serious threat to the reformers.
</P>
<P>
Besides, through the voting in February, Rafsanjani, who had
been parliament speaker for almost nine years and president of the
country for another eight years before becoming chairman of the
SEC, realized
that the Iranian people have lost interest in him, they said.

These major events include Singapore Food Festival, the World
Gourmet Summit, Food &AMP; Hotel Asia and PATA (Pacific Asia Tourism

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Industrial Output Grows in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's industrial production
grew by 7.2 percent year-on-year in April 2000 on a three-month
moving average basis, boosted mainly by higher output in the
electronics cluster, but its expansion was moderating compared
with earlier months this year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's Economic Development Board (EDB) said in its
monthly bulletin Friday that compared with April last year,
industrial output grew by 9.5 percent and cumulative output growth
for the first four months this year hit 12.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The output of the electronics cluster jumped by 20.1 percent
year-on-year in the month of April with the increase spread across
most major sub-sectors except the computer segment.
</P>
<P>
The high growth in the semiconductor segment was driven by
surging demand for chips used in infocomm products while that of
printers was stimulated by stronger demand from Asia-Pacific
markets, mainly Japan, South Korea and China, EDB said.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals cluster declined by 2.7 percent year-on-year in
April, dragged down by a 23.4-percent decline in the output of
refined petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
Output of the engineering cluster was 3.9 percent higher in the
month with a 17.2- percent growth in the precision engineering
segment eroded by a 11.7-percent decline in the transport
equipment segment.
</P>
<P>
Cumulatively, outputs of the electronics, chemicals and
engineering clusters for the first four months grew 21.3 percent,
4.2 percent and 7.1 percent respectively compared with the same
period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Air India to Be Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government decided
here on Friday to privatize the country's international flag
carrier Air India by disinvesting up to 60 percent of the company'
s equity.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on
Disinvestment chaired by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
As part of the disinvestment, the government would give 40
percent of Air India's equity to "strategic partners," including
26 percent to a foreign partner, Disinvestment Minister Arun
Jaitely told the press after the 90-minute meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign partner can be a foreign airlines," he said,
adding that the Indian government would retain 40 percent of the
equity.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to give 10 percent equity to the
employees of Air India through a stock option scheme, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 10 percent equity would be sold in the domestic
market, he said, stressing that at any given point of time foreign
equity would not exceed 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
Friday's decision has put an end to a reported wrangle between
the Disinvestment Ministry and the Civil Aviation Ministry on the
extent of disinvestment in the loss-making airlines.

<HEADLINE> Russian Not to Take Reckless Moves on Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia does not intend to make
mistakes in its policy toward Afghanistan like the former Soviet
Union once did, presidential aide Sergey Yastrzhembsky said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement followed his remarks earlier that Russia might
launch preventive strikes against guerrilla bases on Afghan soil
because of alleged support to rebels in Russia's breakaway Chechen
Republic.
</P>
<P>
"Any replay of that reckless affair in Afghanistan is out of
the question," Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin's spokesman on Chechnya,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia does not rule out anything for national
security reason, he said in reference to the new doctrine which
allows to use nuclear weapons firstly in case of danger.
</P>
<P>
"If need be, we will act carefully, but efficiently,"
Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the head of Russia's Federal Border Service
also condemned Afghanistan's alleged support to Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
Training terrorists to operate in Chechnya constitutes
interference in Russia's internal affairs, Colonel General
Konstantin Totsky said, confirming there are such training camps
in Taliban controlled Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Totsky reaffirmed Yastrzhembsky's threat of preventive strikes
but added that it would worsen the situation on Afghanistan's
borders with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Apologizes But Refuses to Retract Controversial Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
on Friday apologized once again for sparking a furor with his
recent remarks that Japan is a divine country with the emperor at
its center.
</P>
<P>
"I deeply reflect upon and apologize from the bottom of my
heart for causing misunderstanding among many people," Mori told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
"I will take the criticism seriously, engrave it in my heart,
and will be careful from now on," Mori said.
</P>
<P>
But Mori stopped short of retracting his controversial remarks,
which critics say echo the nationalistic fervor of Japan's wartime
aggression.
</P>
<P>
Mori said his comments were not aimed at reviving the ideology
behind Japan's militaristic past, when the emperor was considered
a deity and Japanese troops invaded other Asian countries in his
name.
</P>
<P>
"I have never, even in my personal thoughts, thought of
reviving the state Shinto religion under the sovereignty of the
emperor, as it was before the war," Mori said.
</P>
<P>
Mori, who faces a general election of House of Representatives
next month, called Friday's news conference after his apology at
the Diet (parliament) last week failed to quell the political
storm.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls by Japan's two leading newspapers this week
showed a sharp drop in support for the Mori cabinet in the wake of
his controversial remarks.
</P>
<P>
At a May 15 meeting of lawmakers linked to the Shinto religion,
Mori said, "Japan is a divine country with the emperor at its
center. We have been working for 30 years to have people firmly
acknowledge that."
</P>
<P>
Critics said the comments not only reminded people of the
ideology that drove Japan's wartime militarism, but also ran
counter to the separation of religion and state enshrined in
Japan's constitution.

<P>
SOFIA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's parliament Friday approved
the country's applications for membership of the European Union (
EU), the North Atlantic Treaty Prganization (NATO) and the Western
European Union (WEU).
</P>
<P>
The parliament voted for the government position on the Common
Foreign and Security Policy by 189 votes against 3 without
abstentions, and it was the first time for the opposition
Socialist Party to show support for Bulgaria's entry into NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Common Foreign and Security Policy was proposed at the
Inter-Governmental Conference on Bulgaria's accession to the EU on
March 28, under which the values and interests of all EU member
states will be protected.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the vote, President Peter Stoyanov said the
result showed that a "remarkable consensus" was reached on the
country's foreign policy, which would promote Bulgaria's
negotiations on the EU and NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ivan Kostov described the approval as a further
step toward Bulgaria's integration into the EU.
</P>
<P>
Since the Kosovo crisis in the spring of 1999, the Socialist
Party had opposed Bulgaria's NATO membership.

after all the recent twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
In his written speech presented to a forum here on the cross-
Straits relations, Li Yafei, deputy secretary-general of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said
that a recent official statement makes clear the mainland's stance
on the cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which was issued jointly on authorization of the
Taiwan Work Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council,
also suggests ways to improve cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
The sooner the Taiwan authorities accept the one-China
principle, the sooner the cross-Straits relations will improve.
Otherwise, the relations will remain strained, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Keli, deputy director of the Taiwan Research Institute of
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), said that he didn't
see any goodwill or sincerity in the Taiwan's new leader's speech.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the new leader of Taiwan didn't mention the fact
that he is a Chinese, failed to recognize the one-China principle
and made no gestures toward reunification of the Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Should Recognize One-China Principle: Experts (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the Taiwan authorities are sincere about easing the cross-
Straits relations, they should accept the one-China principle, Yu
said, adding that the statement offers the best way to break the
stalemate in the cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
Researcher Xin Qi at the Peace and Development Studies Center
held that in his speech, the Taiwan new leader used beautiful
words and scholarly rhetoric, which, however, failed to disguise
his true position.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan new leader believes that he can relegate the
issue to the future or to foreign forces and the international
community, the results will be disastrous, Xin said.
</P>
<P>
Li Jiaquan, a researcher at the Taiwan Research Institute of
the CASS, said that in the speech, the Taiwan new leader mentioned
the word "Taiwan" about 40 times, but made no mention of China,
illustrating that he didn't view China as the motherland.
</P>
<P>
If the new leader continues to stand by the notion of "Taiwan
independence" and positions himself at odds with the entire
Chinese nation, he cannot expect a bright future, the scholar
warned.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the forum also noted that the one-China
principle is the prerequisite for the development of the cross-
Straits relations and the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people, including the Taiwan compatriots, will
never allow any form of "Taiwan independence," the participants
said, adding that if the Taiwan authorities were serious about
improving the cross-Straits relations, they should accept the one-
China principle and take substantial steps to promote the
relations.

NEW DELHI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka Army Friday stepped
up ground attacks on various rebel positions, killing 13 Tamil
guerrillas in the face of a renewed ultimatum of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to 30,000 trapped government troops
to surrender by Friday evening, according to the Press Trust of
India.
</P>
<P>
As the LTTE deadline expired at 6 p.m. Friday, Tamil rebels
targeted government troops at strategic locations in Jaffna
peninsula with a heavy barrage of artillery and mortars, prompting
the troops to hit back with artillery fire on suspected rebels
hideouts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the LTTE stepped up its campaign to demoralize the
troops by raising the pitch of its public announcements asking
soldiers to surrender.
</P>
<P>
It said those who surrendered would be handed over to the
International Red Cross within 24 hours. Friday is the last day of
the week-long deadline given by the LTTE for the troops to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE also used public announcement systems in various
fronts in Jaffna to air its warning.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government has firmly ruled out withdrawal of
government troops trapped in Jaffna.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Accuses U.S. of Deliberately Delaying Agreed Nuclear Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) on Friday accused the United States of
deliberately delaying the construction of two light water reactors
for the DPRK, a project it promised in a 1994 nuclear agreement.
</P>
<P>
A signed commentary in the Friday edition of the Rodong Sinmun
newspaper refuted the allegation of "nuclear and missile threat"
from the DPRK made by some U.S hard-liners, which was said would
impact the Western-funded nuclear project under the 1994 accord
signed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
The commentary described the recent U.S. legislation demanding
"compulsory house and senate approval" of any U.S. transfer of
nuclear facilities and technology to the DPRK, based on the
alleged DPRK threat, as a move to deliberately throw hurdles in
the way of implementing the 4.6 billion U.S. dollar project that
has far lagged behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
Under the DPRK-U.S. deal, the United States should complete the
construction of the first of the two 100 megawatt reactors by 2003
and the second one by 2004. However, Western officials have said
several years of delay is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang has repeatedly criticized Washington for having only
paid lip service as regards the project.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK said in the commentary it has suffered heavy economic
losses as a result of its freezing of the country's nuclear
facilities, and the losses are still increasing due to the delayed
construction of the light water reactors.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK warned Washington of possible counter-measure as long
as it seeks to delay the nuclear project.

<HEADLINE> HK Exchange Fund Decreases in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The total assets of the Exchange
Fund of Hong Kong amounted to 948.2 billion HK dollars (121.6
billion U.S. dollars) by April 30 this year, 36.8 billion HK
dollars (4.7 billion U.S. dollars) less than at the end of March,
according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Friday.
</P>
<P>
The figure is included in the Exchange Fund Abridged Balance
Sheet, which is released on a monthly basis together with the
Currency Board Account.
</P>
<P>
Both foreign currency assets and Hong Kong dollar assets
decreased by 3.9 billion HK dollars (500 million U.S. dollars) and
32.9 billion HK dollars (4.2 billion U.S. dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
The drop in foreign currency assets was mainly due to
revaluation effects on foreign currency investments while that in
Hong Kong dollar assets was largely the result of a decrease in
the market value of Hong Kong equities held by the Exchange Fund,
according to the HKMA.

<HEADLINE> HK Takes Pronged Approach to Talents Quest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A major challenge facing Hong
Kong in the quest for talents to enhance its competitiveness is
how to nurture the further growth of the Admission of Talents
Scheme in partnership with the private sector, Timothy Tong,
deputy secretary for security of Hong Kong, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar organized by the American Chamber of
Commerce, Tong said the scheme, which was launched in mid-December
last year to tap talents, in particular mainland talents, for
employment in Hong Kong, had now passed its infancy stage.
</P>
<P>
"How to further nurture partnership with the private sector is
now the question. Acquiring talents is not an easy task since Hong
Kong is not alone in this quest," he said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Tong said the government has adopted a three-
pronged approach to spur the development of the scheme.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the government would approach various chambers of
commerce and industry organizations to explore further whether
joint efforts could be made to help companies source the talents
they require in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Tong said, the government would seek assistance from
the Computer Society and the Federation of Information Technology
because their expertise and experience could help firms draw up
plans in identifying suitable information technology talents in
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, we will reach out to small- and medium-size
companies. We will consult on their requirements to see how well
their needs may be filled through invocation of the scheme," he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the implementation of the scheme
is only the first step forward.
</P>
<P>
"In luring talents to come to join Hong Kong corporations,
persistence to achieve excellent performance by our firms and
their willingness to invest in research and development are
crucial to success," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
As at May 20, 2000, a total of 193 applications have been
received. Among them, 19 applications have been approved and 102
applications refused or withdrawn. The remaining 72 applications
are still being processed because some employers and candidates
have not submitted all necessary supporting documents.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A Taliban ammunition dump
exploded early Friday rocking the Afghan capital of Kabul,news
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred at the ruling Taliban militia's 17th
division military headquarters in Kabul's northern Khair Khan area,
sending shells raining down on civilian areas and frightened
residents fleeing for cover, eyewitnesses were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, there were no injuries reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Taliban's 17th division commander Mullah
Habibullah, the blast was the result of sabotage by the anti-
Taliban opposition forces.
</P>
<P>
He said an explosive device was placed beneath a container in
which the ammunition was stored. However, it was not clear how
opposition soldiers were able to infiltrate into the military base
to plant the bomb.
</P>
<P>
The frontline where opposition forces are fortifying themselves
against the Taliban is at least 20 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia, who seized Kabul in 1996, now occupy most
of the country while the forces loyal to Afghan ex-Defense

<HEADLINE> Talks Between Manila, Abu Sayyaf Re-Set for Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Talks between the Philippine
government and the Abu Sayyaf group were postponed again Friday
after the group took its 21 hostages to another hideout in the
southern Philippine province of Sulu,Philippine News Agency (PNA)
said.
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado was quoted as
saying the talks have been re-scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages, abducted from Malaysia last month and then
moved to Sulu, have been transferred to a village in Talipao town
from Patikul town in Sulu, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
Twelve passenger jeepneys transported the hostages and the Abu
Sayyaf members to the new location, thus affecting the formal
negotiations previously set for Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The transfer of the hostages involved movement of the Abu
Sayyaf elements," with close to 400 fully armed members,
Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence reports disclosed that the Abu Sayyaf group might
present its hostages to the media on Saturday during the formal
talks in Bandang, Talipao.
</P>
<P>
The security arrangement for the final talks is also a big
factor which affects the negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
As this developed, the Abu Sayyaf quoted its leader Galib
Andang, alias Commander Robot, as saying the timetable for the
release of the hostages depends on the result of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The major demand of the Abu Sayyaf group to the government is
the creation of an Islamic state in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
It also wants the creation of a Sabah commission to look into
the welfare of Filipino Muslims in Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Agrees to Resume Talks With Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea has agreed to withdraw
from Bada and Bure and resume the proximity talks with Ethiopia
over a two-year border conflict which broke out again on May 12,
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The OAU said in a press release that Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki had made a written commitment to withdrawal of its troops
from Bada and Bure.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean president also accepted the invitation of the
current OAU Chairman and Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika
to resume the proximity talks with Ethiopia due to be held in
Algiers on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The OAU made the announcement soon after Bouteflika finished
his mediation visits to Ethiopia and Eritrea from Wednesday to
Friday when he held talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
</P>
<P>
These talks allowed Bouteflika to take note of the commitments
of the two belligerent countries, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea was committed to withdrawing its troops to positions
held before May 6, 1998 while Ethiopia promised to redeploy its
forces to position prior to February 6, 1999 in conformity with
the Modalities without prejudging the final status of the
territories concerned, which will be determined at the end of the
delimitation-demarcation process.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries agreed to resolve their border
dispute in conformity with the Framework Agreement and Modalities
on the basis of pertinent colonial treaties and international
applicable law, through delimitation-demarcation with the
assistance of the Cartographic Unit of the United Nations and, if
necessary, through arbitration.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to pursue negotiations under the auspice of
the OAU with the view to finalizing the Consolidated Technical
Arrangements, and thus achieving the implementation of the peace
plan comprised of the Framework Agreement, the Modalities and the
Consolidated Technical Arrangements.

KAMPALA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Four commanders of the rebel Allied
 Democratic Forces captured on May 17 will be handed over to the
Ugandan law authorities, said a Ugandan army spokesman on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"They are going to be handed over to the relevant authorities

<HEADLINE> Malawian President to Intervene in Tobacco Crisis: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili Muluzi may
support Mozambique's efforts to lift the unilateral Malawian ban
on processing Mozambican tobacco, a Mozambican government source
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Virgilio Ferrao, governor of the western province
of Tete, there is information which "indicates that President
Muluzi intends to lift the ban."
</P>
<P>
"For the Mozambican authorities it would be convenient if the
ban were lifted as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the warehouses for the conditioning of the leaf
tobacco bought from the peasants are overcrowded, and some tons of
this product have already deteriorated."
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 7,500 tons of leaf tobacco should
have been sent into Malawi for processing this year, and then
exported to Europe.
</P>
<P>
The ban has also affected Malawian businessmen who grow tobacco
in Mozambique. They met recently with Malawian Agriculture
Minister in an attempt to seek a solution to the impasse, but in
vain.
</P>
<P>
In April Malawi suddenly decided to impose a ban on leaf
tobacco grown in Mozambique and Zambia. No reason was given for
the ban, but it seemed that Malawian producers were panicked at
the low prices offered when the tobacco auction floors opened and
tried to seek an easy scapegoat in foreign producers.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has no processing facilities of its own, and so
tobacco producers in the northern and central provinces have to
send their crop into Malawi for processing.
</P>
<P>
So far all attempts by the Mozambican government to persuade
its Malawian counterpart to lift the ban have been fruitless.

YINCHUAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's mobile eye hospital
known as the "Lifeline Express" has come to northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region to help more cataract patients
regain their eyesight.
</P>
<P>
The mobile train unit came to the regional capital of Yinchuan
Thursday after a 83-day mission in Yibin, a city in southwest
China's Sichuan Province, where it performed 1,000 successful

<P>
All the places the train has visited are remote, poor, and
often in areas which are under developed and lack adequate medical
personnel and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Cataract incidence in the rural areas of Ningxia is high due to
poor medical conditions there, and the coming of "Lifeline Express
" will help nearly 1,000 cataract patients regain their eyesight,

<P>
The program has made a contribution to China's flooding control
and disaster relief, said a ministry official, adding that the two
countries will continue cooperation in the area of water resources.

Wei said that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has had
close contacts and cooperation with the National Trade Union
Congress of Singapore, and this cooperation is a model for trade
unions in countries with differing social systems.
</P>
<P>
The senior CPC official briefed Lim and his delegation on China
's domestic economic and political situation. He said China
welcomes Singapore companies to invest in China's western region.

<HEADLINE> Chinese to Learn About Safe Drug Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A week-long campaign to spread
knowledge about prescription and non-prescription drugs among
ordinary people will be launched across China beginning this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
More than 2.6 million pamphlets and posters are expected to be
handed out to inform people how to correctly use both prescription
and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. Information on drug safety also
can be obtained at the website: www.sda.gov.cn, the Sate Drug
Administration (SDA) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
China has published its first national catalog of OTC drugs,
which includes 165 kinds of Western medicines and 160 kinds of
traditional Chinese medicines. The country began to implement
administrative measures on prescription and OTC drugs this year,
said Bai Huiliang, director of the SDA's Department of Drug Safety
and Inspections.
</P>
<P>
However, the official acknowledged that most Chinese people
still have no idea about this subject, and adverse drug reactions
(ADR) caused by drug abuse remains a major health problem in China.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of regulations, most drug retailers in China do
not classify medicines, and many drugs can be freely purchased
without a doctor's prescription.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from 26 hospitals, about 90 percent of all
ADR-related cases are caused by prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
"These are only the ADR cases that occur under professional
medical supervision. The situation could be much more serious
among patients who buy medicines to treat illnesses by themselves,
" said Shao Mingli, deputy director of the SDA.

BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Two senior officials in southwest

<HEADLINE> HK Publicizes Arbitration Amendment Bill 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Arbitration (Amendment) Bill
2000 which seeks to make it clear that arbitral awards made either
in or outside Hong Kong are summarily enforceable in Hong Kong was
gazetted Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The effect of this would be that awards made in countries or
territories which are not parties to the New York Convention on
the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (
New York Convention) will be summarily enforceable in Hong Kong
with the leave of the court," said a spokesman for the Department
of Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
An amendment to the Arbitration Ordinance was considered
necessary following a recent Court of First Instance judgment
which held that section 2GG of the Ordinance applies only to
awards made in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Bill, which has the support of the legal profession and the
arbitration community, will make it clear that Section 2GG of the
Ordinance applies to awards made either in or outside Hong Kong to
facilitate the summary enforcement in Hong Kong of non-Convention
awards made in such countries or regions as Albania, Brazil, Iraq,
Newfoundland, Taiwan and Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The Bill will enhance Hong Kong's prestige and efficiency as
an international arbitration center," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, summary enforcement of awards made on the mainland
by a recognized arbitral authority, or made in a state or
territory which is a party to the New York Convention is covered
under other parts of the Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
The bill will be introduced to the Legislative Council on May
31, 2000.

<HEADLINE> HK Registers Double-Digit Quarterly GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong economy showed
spectacular performance in the first quarter this year, with the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rendering a 14.3 percent growth in
real terms over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
This was further up from the already pronounced growth of 9.2
percent in the fourth quarter of 1999, and was the fastest growth
recorded since the third quarter of 1987, according to the First
Quarter Economic Report released by the Hong Kong government
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Government economist K. Y. Tang said the further acceleration
in economic growth in the first quarter of this year was broadly
based and characterized by a continued surge in external trade and
a sharp pick-up in both consumption and investment demand.
</P>
<P>
Exports of goods and services, having risen considerably in the
fourth quarter of 1999, accentuated further to increases of 20.7
percent and 16.4 percent respectively in real terms in the first
quarter of 2000 over a year earlier, on the back of the global
economic upswing and improved competitiveness for Hong Kong's
output, he said.
</P>
<P>
Locally, consumer spending also picked up distinctly further to
an 8.3 percent growth in real terms in the first quarter of 2000
over a year earlier, as the employment situation turned more
stable upon the sustained economic recovery, the economist said.
</P>
<P>
He said investment spending resumed positive growth, at 5.6
percent in real terms in the first quarter of 2000 over a year
earlier, after falling for six consecutive quarters.
</P>
<P>
On the back of the very strong performance so far, Tang
forecast the growth rate in real terms of GDP for 2000 is revised
upward to 6 percent, from the earlier forecast of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, exports of goods and services should continue to
benefit from sustained demand from Europe and from within East
Asia, even allowing for some moderation of demand from the United
States later in the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that continued robust growth in exports from the
mainland, coupled with improved competitiveness for the economy,
should also lift Hong Kong's exports.
</P>
<P>
He said that steadier employment and income stemming from the
economic revival should lend better support to consumer spending.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Asks Euro to Dismantle Farm Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik made the
appeal during the meeting with a five-member delegation from the
European parliament here.
</P>
<P>
Europe has promised to dismantle all these trade distorting
subsidies under the EEP program, Lim told reporters after the
meeting, hoping that the European Union will dismantle the farm
and export subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Lim said European farmers had managed to increase production of
oil seeds by using the common agriculture policy of farm and
export subsidies given by the government to compete with other
world producers.
</P>
<P>
A similar program has been used by the United States in
increasing its oil seed production to compete in the world market.
That program also has distorting effects on the market, Lim said.
</P>
<P>
Lim is hoping that local production of crude palm oil (CPO)
this year will not to be more than 11 million tons as any
production increase can affect prices.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia produced 10.5 million tons of CPO last year compared
with 8.3 million tons in 1998.

LAGOS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has intervened in the renewed riots in the northern city of
Kaduna, saying the violence was capable of frightening prospective
investors, The Guardian newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the president as saying that religious disputes were
very dangerous and that he preferred to work quietly behind the
scenes to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo made the remarks after his closed-door emergency
meeting with Governor of Kaduna State Ahmed Makarfi on Thursday in
the capital Abuja, following the violence between Christians and
Muslims that left more than 300 dead in the city.
</P>
<P>
The presidency source declined to give details of the meeting,
except saying that the discussion between the president and the
governor was " frank, sincere and decisive".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a 70-member delegation of the House of
Representatives visiting Kaduna on Thursday urged the Federal and
Kaduna State governments to do everything within their power to
ensure that the latest round of mayhem was the very last one in
Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
The legislators, led by Deputy Speaker Chibudom Nwuche, decried
the avoidable loss of lives and property in the senseless
violence.
</P>
<P>
Troops and police restored order on Thursday in the city
ravaged by the clashes which erupted on Monday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Provides Food for Drought-Affected Ugandans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) has approved a new emergency operation to provide
food aid worth 5.8 million U.S. dollars to vulnerable Ugandans
affected by the drought in northeastern country's Karamoja.
</P>
<P>
The food aid will meet the basic dietary and nutritional needs
of 160, 000 drought victims for a period of six months, said a WFP
press release Friday.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has planned to distribute over 9,000 tons of various
food commodities in the drought-affected areas, said the release,
adding since early April, a total of 3,600 tons of food have been
distributed to the most needy persons.
</P>
<P>
"The food is being distributed to the more vulnerable persons,
identified by the local government as children, women, the elderly
and poor families who do not own or migrate with livestocks,"
WFP's Deputy Country Director in Uganda Michael Jones was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The WFP is also making available commodities for participants
engaged in food-for-work activities, such as construction of
school infrastructure, small dams and water reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
During 1999, the rains in Karamoja came late and were erratic.
It was predicted that during 2000 food shortages would affect some
population.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Karamoja people are cattle owners who
migrate in search of water and pastures during the dry season.
However, 20 percent of 491,000 people who engage in rain-fed
agriculture have been worst affected.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Up Silver, Gold Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "millennium gold bars," engraved with dragons, are believed
to be unusually valuable collectors' items. The bars, weighing
anywhere from 50 to 500 grams, were sold at a rate of 104 yuan per
gram in Beijing, 110 yuan per gram in Shanghai and 112 yuan per
gram in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
The price is approaching the international market price, but is
still a little higher.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, the "millennium gold bars" were sold at Caishikou
Department Store, which has been renowned as the capital's premier
gold store. Although the store sold the bars only four hours a day,
sales surpassed two million yuan every day.
</P>
<P>
Within five days, the store had sold more than 1,000 gold bars.
Since the demand was so large, the store ran out of gold to sell.
So far, about 2,000 people are still waiting to buy gold bars.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the major reason for people to buy gold is
that the people are having a difficult time spending their extra
money at a time when market demand falls short of supply and the
interest rate has been lowered several times to stimulate spending.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that people in Shanghai possess an average of 0.
28 grams of gold, compared with the more than eight grams owned by
Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
Many observers noted that although the sale of the "millennium
gold bars" was just a trial opening up of the market, it shows
that the day when the gold market will be completely opened to
gold investors is coming soon.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Up Silver, Gold Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China is to open up this year its
silver and gold market which were previously under strict state
control, according to the latest issue of Beijing Review.
</P>
<P>
A recent circular issued by the People's Bank of China says
that the state will no longer impose restrictions on most of the
processing, purchasing or sale of silver.
</P>
<P>
The producer and retailers will be able to conduct business
directly and the production and sale of silver will be managed the
same as other ordinary commodities.
</P>
<P>
The opening up of the silver market signals the end of 50 years
of strict control and a speeding up of the country's march toward
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Related departments are also working on regulations to
encourage fair competition and trading in the silver market.
</P>
<P>
After the opening up of the silver market, many experts
suggested that the gold market also be opened up to enable
ordinary Chinese people to possess more gold.
</P>
<P>
However, the government prefers a more cautious approach toward
the gold market. One of the trial runs for opening the market was
the sale of 1.5 tons of gold bars, which began December 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The gold bars, called "millennium gold bars" were sold at
designated stores in 11 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai,
Nanjing and Chengdu.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Leader Urged to Stop Blurring, Evading One-China Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua News Agency published a
signed commentary today urging the Taiwan leader to show his
sincerity and goodwill on cross-Straits ties by ceasing to blur
and evade the One-China Principle.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, titling "It Is Hard to Resolve Problems by
Blurring and Evading One-China Principle," continued Xinhua's
criticism of the Taiwan leader for his blurred and evasive
attitude toward the principle in his May 20 speech.
</P>
<P>
According to his speech, the differences in the political
systems and life-styles across the Straits have created "
contradictory walls," though he agreed, that "the people of the
two sides share the same origins of blood, culture, and history."
</P>
<P>
In the speech, the Taiwan leader mentioned in the same breath
Taiwan's "local culture," "Chinese culture and world culture," and
he also called Taiwan "Formosa" and the Taiwan people "offspring
of Formosa," according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
By saying these things, the Taiwan leader intended to separate
Taiwan from China, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan leader called the One-China Principle a "future
issue" in his speech, replacing the word "proposal," which he used
in the past to describe his view of the principle.
</P>
<P>
The expression "future issue" indirectly denies the historic,
de facto and de jure nature of the One-China Principle, which
indicates his insistence on the position of "Taiwan independence,"
the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan leader's speech resulted in a local stock market
plunge in the island, the commentary said, noting that this shows
the speech has aroused doubts among the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
The commentary reiterated the position of the Chinese
government on the One-China Principle, that everything is
negotiable under the principle.
</P>
<P>
Evasion will not resolve the issue, and blurring is not helpful
for the establishing of trust between the two sides, the
commentary concluded.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet OKs National Park near Mount of Olives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet ministers have
endorsed a scheme to build a national park on the slopes of the
Mount of Olives, which will significantly advance right-wing
efforts to cut off Jerusalem's Old City from the rest of Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement of the plan ended years of secret work by Jews,
headed by Knesset (Parliament) member Benny Elon from the National
Union party, The Jerusalem Post reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Mount of Olives, which overlooks Jerusalem, is a holy
mountain to the Jews and Christians in East Jerusalem because the
Bible says it is there that Jesus will return to the earth.
</P>
<P>
Although the ministers have okayed the plan, they were not aware
that the 174-dunam (17 hectares) park was one of 17 projects aimed
at creating Jewish continuity around the holy city's Old City, said
the paper.
</P>
<P>
The projects, whose total investment will be 150 million U.S.
dollars, will eventually lead to an unbroken Jewish presence from
highway No. 1 at Shimon Hatzadik, just east of Jerusalem, through
to Abu Dis, the Arab village on the outskirts of Jerusalem, whose
transfer to full Palestinian control has been delayed by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak following recent violent demonstrations in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the park move on the settlement of the Jerusalem
issue remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
"Of late there's been an explosion of illegal Arab construction
in the area," said Elon. "The park status means Arabs will not be
allowed to build there at all."
</P>
<P>
To free up the area ahead of declaration of its national park
status, Elon and his associates spent several years persuading the
Israel Lands Administration, now the majority property owner, to
commence a process of land expropriation. Originally the plot was
entirely Arab-owned.
</P>
<P>
The minister responsible for Jerusalem affairs, Haim Romon, said
he had no knowledge of the park and would only comment if and when
the details are made public.
</P>
<P>
The bottom line for the Arab leadership, said Elon, is that it
wants to see continuity between the Old City and the surrounding
Arab districts. Elon and his partners say they will try to stop
this at all costs, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest issues to be
tackled by the Israelis and Palestinians in their final-status
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been striving for an independent state
with East Jerusalem as its capital while Israel insists on keeping
Jerusalem as its "eternal and undivided capital."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Navy Suspends Joint Training Programs  With Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Navy Chief of Staff Adm. Achmad Sutjipto Friday told
reporters that the joint training programs could be resumed once
they become priority.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not provide details on the programs being
suspended.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Capt. David J. Ramsay, defense attache of the
Australian embassy here, said the suspension of the joint training
programs will not effect the relations between the two countries'
navies.
</P>
<P>
"Some Australian officers are still continuing their studies at
(Indonesia's) Navy Command School. The same thing with Indonesian
officers in Australia," Ramsay said.
</P>
<P>
Both countries will discuss the possibility of continuing the
joint training programs.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we could discuss the issue in August or November
after President Wahid's visit to Australia," he was quoted by the
Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab Thursday confirmed that
Wahid has decided to visit Australia sometime next month.
</P>
<P>
He said the main aim of the visit will be to mend bilateral
ties that plummeted last year after East Timor's vote for
independence on August 30.
</P>
<P>
The visit will also focus on a tripartite meeting between the
leaders of Australia, Indonesia and East Timor, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Cheaper HIV/AIDS Drugs to Benefit Africans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Prices for HIV/AIDS drugs will
reduce by 80 percent to make them affordable to African patients,
a senior Zambian health official has disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Garvin Silwamba, director general of the Central Board of
Health, who attended health ministers and experts meeting in
Geneva recently, told Friday's Zambia Daily Mail that the meeting
had resolved that prices for HIV/AIDS drugs such as Zidovin and
Crixivan would be cut by 80 percent to be affordable to Africans.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba said the drugs had been scientifically proved to be
effective in maintaining health standards of those suffering
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He said the only weakness of the drugs was that patients had to
continue taking them.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva conference was also attended by directors of
pharmaceutical firms which manufacture the drugs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, African governments were allowed to use DDT, a
chemical banned for manufacturing, to fight malaria.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba said this was because malaria was still a killer
disease in Africa and that the use of DDT was an economical way to
prevent mosquitos from spreading malaria.

<HEADLINE> Tension in Guinea-Bissau Eased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Tension between the Guinea-Bissau's
civil and military authorities has been defused, the country's
Prime Minister Caetano Intchama has said.
</P>
<P>
Intchama made the remarks when he informed the national
parliament in the capital of Bissau on Thursday of the results of
the Tuesday meeting between President Kumba Iala and General
Ansumane Mane, who led the former military junta that overthrew
president Nino Vieira in May 1999, said a report reaching here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Intchama said the question of navy commander Lamine Sanha, who
had refused to step down from his post, "seemed difficult" at the
start but was nevertheless resolved.
</P>
<P>
Sanha was dismissed on April 28 after freeing a Korean fishing
vessel caught for fishing illegally in Guinea-Bissau waters.
</P>
<P>
At the Tuesday meeting it was decided that Sanha, who is
considered close to General Mane, should leave the Bissau navy
base and await at home a court ruling on his case.
</P>
<P>
President Iala in turn has indefinitely postponed the
appointment of a new navy commander.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A strong earthquake measuring 5.3 on
the Richter scale rocked northwestern Greece in the Ionian seabed
early Friday, causing damage to houses but no injuries.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake was recorded at 4:25 a.m. local time (0225 GMT),
and its epicenter was the Ionian sea, the semi-official Athens
News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Being strongly felt in Preveza and the prefectures of Arta,
Ioannia and Thesprotia, the earthquake caused panic among local
residents. Several houses were damaged and three people were taken
to hospital for shock treatment.
</P>
<P>
It was the second strong earthquake in 72 hours. An earthquake
registered 6.0 on the Richter scale struck the seabed, some 120
kilometers off the southern port city of Kalamata in the
Peloponnese Wednesday, but no damage or injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, a total of 143 people were killed and
thousands others injured when a strong earthquake hit the Mount
Parnitha region, some 20 kilometers northwest of Athens.

New South Wales state police commissioner Peter Ryan said six

More than 500 military, police and state and federal

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- France's Olympic judo champion David
Douillet, out of action for seven months with a back injury, has
once again postponed his planned return to competition, according
to an AFP report.
</P>
<P>
Douillet, triple world heavyweight champion who missed last
year's world championships because of injury, told AFP that he
will not compete in next month's Sardinia tournament.
</P>
<P>
Instead the Olympic champion will aim to take part in his first
tournament in over a year in Bonn, Germany from August 12-13.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old has been trying to get over an injury to a disc
in his back as he bids to defend his Olympic title in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a bit short," Douillet was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It's not the training itself that causes the pain. It's
everyday movements when I'm tired or stressed."
</P>
<P>
However, he is not worried by this latest delay in his planned
comeback. "I just need a tournament as a point of reference," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian PM Urges News Media to Strengthen Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye has urged news media in Tanzania and China to
improve their news reporting on the other country so as to promote
mutual understanding and push forward socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the call here on Thursday when he met
with a visiting Xinhua News Agency delegation led by its
Vice-President Zhang Baoshun.
</P>
<P>
He said information is an important tool for the development of
both countries. It can also help people in different countries
have an in-depth understanding of each other.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye, who paid a working visit to China in March this year,
told the Xinhua officials that it was his hope that their
information institutions could provide Chinese business community
with more economic information on Tanzania, letting them know the
potential investment opportunities in this country.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said Xinhua, as China's state news agency with a history
of more than 60 years, has always been known as the most important
channel to know about China because news it releases is timely,
adequate, authoritative and reliable.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua, which established its bureau in Dar es Salaam shortly
after Tanzania achieved independence at the beginning of the
1960s, has been covering the political and economic development in
the country on the principles of truthfulness, objectivity,
impartiality and timeliness.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said Xinhua is willing to strengthen its cooperation with
news media in the developing countries including Tanzania to
strive for its development and for the establishment of a new,
impartial and justified international political and economic
order.

SEOUL, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The inter-Korean trade hit 333.44

URUMQI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Wild rats are causing serious damage
to the world's largest sacsaoul forest in the Ganjia Lake Sacsaoul
Nature Reserve in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
According to local forestry administration, more than 13,333
hectares of sausaoul trees in the nature reserve have been damaged
by wild rats, in addition to more than 11,333 hectares of sacsoul
trees damaged in its surrounding areas. Many trees have died.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the problem is expanding toward the central
part of the nature reserve despite preventive measures by local
forestry administration.
</P>
<P>
The Ganjia Lake Nature Reserve, situated to the west of the
Gurgantunggut Desert, covers 53,333 hectares and is an important
base for studying the eco-system of deserts.
</P>

Forestry experts attributed the rat disaster to the
accelerating desertification in nearby areas and excessive farming
in the area.
</P>
<P>
Excessive poaching of wild animals that eat wild rats has been
cited as another reason for the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Children Main Victims of Road Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Children turned out to be the main
victims of traffic accidents in Jordan as some 1,220 children died
and 26,000 injured in traffic related accidents in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accident casualties for Jordanians under the age of 18
declined in 1999, but still accounted for over 30 percent of the
killed and injured during the years, according to a survey
conducted by the Traffic Institute of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The survey released Friday shows the year 1999 alone saw 50,000
road accidents which killed 676 people and injured another 19,000,
rendering the desert kingdom as one of the countries with the
highest traffic accident mortality rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
Over a span of the five years, some 60 percent of victims of
traffic accidents are children under the age of 18, said Jamil
Salim, head of the institute.
</P>
<P>
Over-speeding, poor road conditions, ignorance of seat belts,
sharp twists and turns on the highways are mainly blamed for the
soaring road accidents in the country.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that Jordanian children were ill informed
and educated about traffic laws, and the Traffic Institute has
prepared traffic safety handbooks for school children at all ages.
</P>
<P>
The handbooks had been forwarded to the Education Ministry for
approval and might be included in the curricula of schools across
the kingdom.

On Thursday afternoon, at least 12 students were injured and 10
others were detained as they were throwing molotov cocktails and
rocks confronted police guarding Soeharto's house. Chanting "Hang
Soeharto, Hang Soeharto", the students attacked a barricade of
police who then repeatedly fired tear gas to disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic clashes continued into the night and a police station
was set on fire.
</P>
<P>
The students came onto the streets on Friday morning hunting
for military vehicles. They set four police and military vehicles
on Friday noon, causing heavy traffic congestion in the area.
</P>
<P>
The protest was the latest in a spate of anti-Soeharto rallies
in recent months in which dozens have been injured.

<HEADLINE> Hijacker's Lifeless Body Recovered in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A joint army-police patrol found
Friday the lifeless body of the lone hijacker of a Philippine
Airlines (PAL)Airbus-300 stuck in Quezon, Metro Manila, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
Oscar Calderon, a local police chief, said the body of hijack
suspect Agusto Lakandula was recovered on Friday morning in a mud
in Llabak village, Quezon, where he landed after parachuting from
the plane.
</P>
<P>
Lakandula was one of the some 280 passengers of PAL Flight PR
812 on a flight of Davao City to Manila when he announced a hijack
while the plane was approaching to land at the Ninoy Aquino
International Airport (NAIA) Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Armed with a parachute and a gun and handgrenade, the hijacker
robbed the passengers of their money before jumping at the rear
door of the plane at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
Before he could jump, he was pushed by a flight attendant who
feared that Lakandula's grenade, whose pin was already pulled,
might explode inside the aircraft endagering the lives of the 277
passengers and 12 crew members.
</P>
<P>
According to a witness in Llabak, Lakandula's chute had opened
but separated from mid air and his body landed on land without a
parachute, killing him instantly.
</P>
<P>
His remains will be brought to the national police headquarters
for autopsy Friday, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's hijack drama ended without any of the passenger or
crew hurt after the Airbus plane landed safely at the NAIA.

COLOMBO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka's national Ceylon
Electricity Board (CEB) Friday appealed to the public to conserve
power in their daily activities as there is a possibility of a
power crisis in the country, a senior officer here said.
</P>
<P>
Since hydro reservoir levels of the country continue to
deteriorate, there is a possibility of a power crisis arising as a
consequence and remedial measures should be immediately taken to
conserve electricity in order to overcome the situation, Arijun
Deraniyagala, Chairman of CEB, said at a press conference
organized by the Ministry of Irrigation and Power.
</P>
<P>
He said the CEB appealed to the public to conserve power in
their daily activities as energy consumption has increased to 20
million units on Tuesday despite the CEB's warning about a
possible energy crisis in future two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The CEB is now considering the steps to be taken to avert
possible power cuts within the next two weeks an no rainfall has
been recorded in the hydro catchment areas during the last few

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Urges Employers to Avoid Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has cautioned employers not to take advantage of the power
rationing to lay off workers.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Times newspaper Friday quoted Moi as saying that
employers should be mindful of other people's welfare and avoid
victimizing the workers.
</P>
<P>
Kenya started rationing power last September following a
failure of long rains and the rationing worsened recently when the
length of power cuts increased to at least 12 hours a day and six
days a week from next week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moi told planners in the energy sector on Thursday
to look for alternative sources of energy because hydro-electric
power has proved to be inadequate due to the unpredictable weather
patterns.
</P>
<P>
The president also told the Electricity Regulatory Board to
license power-generating plants to boost power supply in the east
African country.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union will give 5.6
million euros (5.06 million U.S. dollars) to Kenya for a
five-year biodiversity conservation project, media here reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed on Thursday by head of the EU
delegation to Kenya Lutz Salzman and Kenyan Finance Minister Chris
Okemo.
</P>
<P>
The aid will cover four main areas in biodiversity
conservation: education and awareness, revenue generating
projects, reduction of human and biodiversity conflict and
reducing the threats of conservation.
</P>
<P>
Okemo said that the project aims to establish a "demand-driven,
 flexible funding mechanism to support local initiatives that
enhance sustainable biodiversity conservation" in the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
Salzman said EU was keen on supporting biodiversity
conservation because it directly linked to poverty eradication and
is a source of food, medicine and construction material.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Visit Location of "Bigfoot" in Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Guided tours on the periphery of
Shennongjia Nature Reserve, believed home to the "Bigfoot," will
be provided in the Fall, said Wang Zhenyou, mayor of Yichang City
where the Three Gorges Project is under construction.
</P>
<P>
"They will be able to visit the roads where local residents
have reportedly seen 'Bigfoot,' but tourists will not be allowed
to go further into the Nature Reserve," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The guided tours is a part of the Yangtze Three Gorges
International Tourism Festival in Yichang City, central China's
Hubei Province from September 30 to October 30.
</P>
<P>
A team of paleoanthropologists from Beijing, local researchers
and reporters have discovered 40-cm-long footprints, brown hair
and chewed corn cobs in Shennongjia last October. The possibility
that it was a bear has been ruled out by Yuan Zhenxin, a well-
known paleoanthropologist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (
CAS).
</P>
<P>
Life science professor Pan Wenshi from Beijing University
visited the Nature Reserve several years ago. He believed that it
was not an ideal living environment for quadrumana because of
frequent human activities and shortage of broad-leaved trees and
berries in the forest.
</P>
<P>
Wang Fangchen, head of the Committee for Search for Rare
Animals and Plants, said that repeated attempts to track down "
Bigfoot" have been disappointing. However, a few scientists do
believe the possibility that such a half-man, half-ape creature
still exists in the forest.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there have been sightings of "Bigfoot" in
Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Develop Cells Killing Tumor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists announced that
they have developed cells which produce and secrete immune toxin
to effectively kill tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Fourth Medical University of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army developed the cells by using genetic
recombination technology.
</P>
<P>
Through years of research, professor Yang Angang and his
colleagues found that T Lymphocytes can produce and secrete immune
toxins, while at the same time the growth and function of such
cells remains normal.
</P>
<P>
Based on this discovery, they developed the HER-2 antibody
which can distinguish cancer genes together with the PE40 genes
and thus develop immune toxic genes.
</P>
<P>
They said that such cells can live inside the body for several
months and can circulate and root at the lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in east China's Zhejiang Province are expected to use
the cells on a trial basis soon.

<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey indicates migration
of a large number of farmers to urban areas in China as a result
of the country's reform and opening-up endeavor in the past more
than two decades.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the China Economic Climate Monitoring
Center among 18,700 rural families, shows that 17.2 percent of
families have one member working outside, 4.1 percent have two
members working outside and one percent have three or more family
members working outside.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, families with one member working in local
township enterprises account for 5.8 percent of the surveyed
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that this has eased the pressure of surplus rural
labor, raised the income of farmers, and fueled national economic
growth by facilitating urbanization in China.
</P>
<P>
However, urbanization in the country still has a long way to go,
and experts call for the improvement of education in rural areas.

Parents expect their kids to receive higher education in a bid

Parents have less and less time to spend with their children.
Instead, they are more likely to spend their spare time relaxing

BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China is developing its building
materials industry by stepping up Sino-foreign cooperation and
introducing overseas funds, according to the State Administration
of Building Materials Industry.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Maps out Strategy for National Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China will step up its
afforestation efforts by dividing the country into four regions,
according to a senior Chinese forestry official.
</P>
<P>
The first region covers more than 700 counties in the upper
reaches of the Yangtze River, and the upper and middle reaches of
the Yellow River, a region that has the most serious soil erosion
in China, said Zhou Shengxian, deputy-director of the State
Forestry Administration on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Efforts in the region will focus on the ongoing afforestation
projects along the upper reaches of the Yangtze, and the upper and
middle reaches of the Yellow, the two longest rivers in China, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The second region includes over 400 counties in the arid and
sandy areas of northwestern, northern, and northeastern China. The
major task for the region is to protect natural forests and make
forests to prevent desertification.
</P>
<P>
He said that the third region covers the natural forests in
northeastern China and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region where
efforts will center on protecting natural forests and reduce
limber production.
</P>
<P>
The fourth region covers all areas outside the above three
regions, he said, adding that apart from afforestation, planting
trees for commercial purposes will also be an important task for
this region.

<HEADLINE> China Issues New Rules on Fighting Computer Viruses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China has adopted two regulations
in an attempt to reinforce the ability to ward off possible
computer virus attacks in the future.
</P>
<P>
These regulations come in the wake of the "Love Bug" virus
which swept the world several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rules, confirmation of a virus and the
effectiveness of anti-virus software should be carried out by
organizations designated by the Ministry of Public Security,
rather than individuals or any software producer.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security, which formulated the
regulations, successfully fought the "PINGPANG", the first
computer virus to appear in China, with its free virus-killing
software "Kill" in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation of these two rules will help improve the legal
framework for virus fighting efforts in China, and put an end to
unfair competition among virus-killing software makers.
</P>
<P>
Software producers, because of commercial considerations,
usually boasted of the omnipotence of their virus-killing software,
or exaggerated the destructive potential of a virus.

 China Plans to Limit Desert Expansion
</P>
<P>
China's State Forestry Administration has drafted a plan that
it hopes will limit desertification, which is one of China's most
serious problems.
</P>
<P>
The plan, if successful, would mean that the deserts would no
longer expand 2,460 square kilometers a year, as happens now.
</P>
<P>
Desertification could be curbed as early as 2010 or perhaps
within 30 years, Forestry Deputy Director Li Yucai said at a
recent seminar.

 China Facing Growing Impact of Red Tides
</P>
<P>
China has been experiencing increasing red tides off the
Chinese coast since the 1990s due to increasing pollution caused
by industrial waste water, according to an official report.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, a total of 200 red tides have been
registered and over the past three years there had been 45 major
red tides, causing 240 million U.S. dollars in direct economic
losses, the recently issued annual report by the State Oceanic
Administration of China said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the results of China's largest survey of 2.68 million
sq. km of sea waters under its jurisdiction, the report predicts
that about 20 to 30 red tides are expected to occur this year in
the coastal sea waters, compared with 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
Waste Water Pollutes Huangpu River
</P>
<P>
Waste water from households has become the major source of

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Increases VAT to Facilitate EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has decided to increase its
value-added tax (VAT) from 8 percent to 10 percent as a step to
promote its drive for the accession into the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The increase was approved by the House of Representatives
Thursday night, thus aligning the island country's taxation system
with EU, which wanted Cyprus to increase the VAT rate to EU's
average of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
To be effective from July 1, the VAT hike was also aimed at
lowering Cyprus' fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
This move was also prompted by the International Monetary Fund,
whose officials visiting the island earlier this week expressed
concerns at growing fiscal shortfalls and urged Cyprus authorities
to approve the VAT increase as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, the House also approved to give more
than half of the VAT hike revenues back to the taxpayers in the
form of incentives.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 60 million Cyprus pounds (120 million U.S. dollars)
in expected annual revenues gains from the VAT hike, some 47
million pounds (94 million dollars) could be returned to the
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
One of the main incentives is an increase in tax-free income
from 5,000 pounds (10,000 dollars) to 6,000 pounds (12,000
dollars).
</P>
<P>
But opponents to the hike, most of them from the main opposition
left-wing AKEL party and the Social Democrats Movement KISOS, said
the compensatory incentives did little for the low-income people.
</P>
<P>
The poorer people and those who have no work would still suffer
the effects of increased VAT, they insisted.

<HEADLINE> N. Zealand Expected to Make Tough Response to Fiji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It quoted New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark as saying Fiji
should expect a "pretty tough" response after choosing to abandon
its 1997 Constitution and give in to the demands of coup leader
George Speight.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs,
the country's traditional powerful body, has endorsed Speight's
demand to overthrow the nation's Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry
and agreed to amend the Constitution, pardon all those who
participated in the coup and include Speight into a new government.
</P>
<P>
Clark said the council's proposal is unacceptable and would not
be tolerated by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no acceptance internationally of an outcome which
defies constitutional processes," she said.
</P>
<P>
She added that what the council had proposed would deny normal
democratic rights to the minority Indian population there.
</P>
<P>
"Fiji has to be aware that the path it is on of denying the
normal democratic rights to a minority because of their race is
utterly unacceptable," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Government is understood to be looking at a
range of options, from recalling the New Zealand High Commission
to imposing trade, tourism and sports sanctions.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that New Zealand could block preferential trade
access for Fijian goods coming into New Zealand or slash the
annual about 2.5 million U.S. dollars Fiji receives from New
Zealand in official development aid.

<HEADLINE> Barshefsky Vows to Push Approval of PNTR for China by Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky Thursday vowed to push the passage of the bill
on permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Barshefsky said the
Clinton administration would continue its strong efforts until the
bill is passed by the Senate and finally becomes law upon
signature by the president.
</P>
<P>
"We have now turned our attention to the Senate," she said,
adding that she and other administration officials would meet with
the Senate leadership this week to discuss how to move the bill
forward.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives Wednesday approved the bill
by a vote of 237-197.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote on the bill early next month.
Leadership aides disclosed on Thursday that Senate leaders will
try to schedule a floor vote on the bill by the second week of
June.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky said both the United States and China should take
all possible actions to make the bilateral relationship "more
predictable and more stable."
</P>
<P>
She said although the U.S. and China disagree with each other
in many areas, the two countries have worked together in finding
common ground on many issues. "Certainly China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) and PNTR is one of such issues,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
She urged both countries to better educate the public and
enhance understanding between each other to make the bilateral
relationship "positive" and "sustainable."
</P>
<P>
The trade representative also spoke highly of the progress
China has made in the protection of intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
"China has become much more sophisticated in its understanding
of the importance of intellectual property rights protection," she
said, "and this is itself a very important step forward."

<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The severe drought situation in
north China will be slightly alleviated due to showers or thunder
showers expected in the next few days, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
But the severe situation will not be changed fundamentally as
there are still some other factors causing the drought, said Zhang
Jiatuan, an official with the State Flood Control and Drought
Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The factors he cited including the excessive use of surface
water source, hot temperature, strong winds, and duststorms that
have hit major part of north China since the early Spring, and an
inadequate water storage of reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiao Peijin, deputy director of the Central
Meteorological Station, showers or thunder showers are expected in
Weishui River Valley in Shaanxi Province and major parts in north
China and northeast China from May 26 to 28, with three to 15
millimeters of rainfall and 50 to 70 millimeters of rainfall in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
"This will just slightly alleviate drought-stricken areas," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Major parts north to the Yangtze river are experiencing the
most serious droughts since the 1990s. Latest statistics show that
droughts hit 12.7 million hectares of farmland in China, and 15.6
million people and 13.1 million head of livestock do not have
enough water.

<P>
SEOUL, May 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Samsung Electronics has
developed a low-voltage 16Meg SRAM chip for mobile devices, the
company said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new SRAM chip supports 3V and 1.8 V, reducing power
consumption dramatically, a feature to be adopted by high-tech
mobile gears.
</P>
<P>
The new chip consumes one fourth the power of the normal
product due to TBGA (tape ball grid array), a type of chip size
package for smaller mobile handset manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
It is designed to support 32bit data line, which is twice as
fast as other competitive products, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Samsung said the new chip is tailed for high-speed internet and
multimedia transmission over cellular phones.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Unveil Cause of Macaque's Albinism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have found that
the change of tyrosinase, one of the color-controlling genes, is
the reason that macaques suffer from albinism.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yaping, a researcher from the Kunming Animal Research
Institute affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and his
colleagues came to this conclusion by using molecular genetics
method in analyzing the cause of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Zhang explained that the tyrosinase consists of five exons, and
the variance occurs on the first exon, which makes the exon ends
at an earlier stage.
</P>
<P>
The first exon blocks the formation of a complete tyrosinase
gene which can greatly affect the function of the gene and lead
macaque's albinism.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the findings are very important in the development
of genetic medicine for human albinism.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, a male albinism macaque was found in
mountainous areas in southwest China's Yunnan Province. In 1987,
a normal-haired macaque mated with the saved macaque and gave
birth to a normal-haired macaque.
</P>
<P>
The latter then produced an albinism macaque after mating with
an albinism macaque, becoming the first artificially-bred macaque
in the world.

estimated earning of 4.5 billion U.S. dollars, up 10 percent over
that of last year, according to the Development Research Center of
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from the center attributed the rosy future to four
reasons: price advantage, limited domestic market, favorable state
policies, and the recovering Asian market.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the expansion of China's domestic market for
household electrical appliances is slim as most families have
already purchased staple products including refrigerator, washing
machine and air-conditioners.
</P>
<P>
However, emerging products such as microwave oven are becoming
increasingly popular.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Entrepreneurs Advise Governor of Yunnan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen foreign entrepreneurs were
invited on Thursday to a meeting to express their views on
economic development in Yunnan province, attended by provincial
governor Li Jiating and other officials.
</P>
<P>
"Any suggestions and criticisms will be of help to improving
our work, including overseas investment", Li Jiating said.
</P>
<P>
"According to state policy, if overseas-funded companies
purchase China-made equipment, they are entitled to enjoy tax
rebates. But some government officials said that they knew nothing
about these tax rebates. We had to make a copy of the document for
them," said Gao Chunkuan, vice president of a Hongkong-funded
chemical corporation.
</P>
<P>
Qiying, vice president of a Sino-American joint venture
complained that some of his senior managers couldn't get permanent
residential registration. This is not a good policy if China want
to attract talented personnel to come to Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
Public security is also a problem. Public order in the
provincial development zone, for example, was not so satisfactory,
another foreign businessman said.
</P>
<P>
Happy to hear the views, governor Li said "We will abolish some
local regulations and formulate new ones to improve the investment
environment." And the provincial government will educate officials
at all levels through publicizing some positive and negative
examples in this regard, Li noted. He also noted that media
institutions will also be encouraged to supervise the
implementation of the government's laws, regulations and local
statues.

<P>
CHONGQING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- He is employed by one of China's
most influential newspapers "Computer News" as a column editor and
his website is recommended by Netease, one of the country's most
well-known websites.
</P>
<P>
Li Qiyuan is a 16-year-old junior school student from the
Chongqing municipality in southwest China. When he was eleven, his
parents bought a computer.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the boy began to surf the Net and published his first
article in "Computer Space", run by the State Information Center.
He has published more than 30 articles in IT-related magazines and
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
With the help of other computer fans, he started his web page -
Qiyuan - and later helped design a dozen homepages for several
websites.

On May 8, 1999, the day when China's embassy in Yugoslavia was
bombed by NATO, the boy worked for five hours that very night
writing articles to express his indignation on his homepage.

Computer networks have become an important part of his life. "I
have a dream to build my Qiyuan website into the most famous
website in the world," he said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: India-China Friendship A Historical Necessity: President By Xiong Changyi and Zhou Xiaozheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Friendship and cooperation
between India and China is a "historical necessity," not only for
the two countries, but also for the world, Indian President K.R.
Narayanan said on the eve of his six-day state visit to China,
which is scheduled to begin on May 28.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very much looking forward to the visit to China with a
degree of excitement. What I expect from this visit is to increase
the goodwill and friendship between the two countries and to
create a greater mutual understanding," said Narayanan in an
interview with Chinese journalists based in Delhi.
</P>
<P>
As China and India marked the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of their diplomatic relations on April 1 this year,
the Indian president described the current relationship between
the two countries as "satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
"There is peace on the border; we have signed agreements with
China -- peace and tranquillity agreement on border and agreement
on Confidence Building Measures. We have also been engaged in
talks with China at various levels. The Joint Working Group and
Expert Group have been very patiently and persistently discussing
our problems between each other," said Narayanan.
</P>
<P>
Though there remain some differences between India and China,
both countries have been discussing and will continue to discuss "
in the spirit of friendship," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"As (Chinese) President Jiang Zemin said while he was here, we
should develop our relationship, orient it towards a constructive
and cooperative relationship in the 21st century. This is the same
approach I am taking during this visit," he said. President Jiang
paid a state visit to India in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Indian president said that he envisaged "very good
prospects" for India and China to work together and cooperate
together in bilateral fields as well as in international fields.
</P>
<P>
At the present moment, developing countries as a whole are in a
weaker position in relation to the developed countries. As the two
largest developing countries in the world, India and China "have a
duty" to cooperate with each other, to make the developing world
strong and their voice heard in the world, the president said,
adding that "there is also a necessity from the point of view of
the world balance for India and China to cooperate together."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that India-China friendship is a historical
necessity today for our peoples as well as for the world. If we
can work together with mutual confidence in each other and with
hope for the future, it should be possible for us, for our two
countries to influence the world and contribute to the shaping of
a better, more equal and just world," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
The president went on to say that the prospects for India and
China to cooperate on the economic front are also "very bright."
</P>
<P>
"Both our countries are opening up and liberalizing our
economies, and are developing rapidly," he noted. "In this
environment, we can cooperate with each other in various fields."
</P>
<P>
Although the Sino-Indian bilateral trade has increased seven-
fold since 1990 to reach nearly 2 billion U.S. dollars presently,
it is far below the two countries' potential, said Narayanan.
</P>
<P>
"We have to put our heads together to find practical ways of
increasing substantially trade and economic and technological
cooperation between our two countries," he urged.
</P>
<P>
A veteran diplomat and statesman, Narayanan was the Indian
ambassador to China in the 1970s. In 1990 and 1994, he visited
China twice as a member of an Indian parliamentary delegation and
the vice president of India, and called on Chinese President Jiang
on both occasions.
</P>
<P>
The president told the Chinese journalists that the deepest
impression he had during his stay in China was the "sincere and
friendly" attitude of the Chinese people towards him personally
and towards the people of India.
</P>
<P>
"The other great impression left on me is the capacity of the
Chinese people to work diligently and with determination in order
to lift the millions of their people to a better life and make
China a great country in the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he would like to send his warm
greetings to the Chinese people on the eve of his departure, and
wished the Chinese people "all prosperity, happiness and success"
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to meeting them personally, to understand
the great changes that have taken place there since my last visit
and forge further bonds of friendship and cooperation between our
two countries," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Beats Knicks to Take 2-0 Lead in Eastern Conference Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Dale Davis rebounded his own
missed free throw and fed Jalen Rose for a dunk with 2.4 seconds
left, wrapping up an 88-84 victory over the New York Knicks on
Thursday night in Indianapolis as the Indiana Pacers took a 2-0
lead in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
Davis had a chance to lock up the victory but missed two free
throws with 5.8 seconds left. Charging in from the foul line, he
only had to get past point guard Charlie Ward for the rebound.
Davis grabbed it and found Rose wide open for an emphatic slam
that sealed the game.
</P>
<P>
Rose led the Pacers with 24 points, Reggie Miller had 19 for
the second straight game and Rik Smits scored 10 of his 12 in the
fourth quarter. Dale Davis grabbed 16 rebounds for the Pacers, who
trailed for much of the game but scored the final six points to
win it.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing injured his foot with just under six minutes
remaining in the first quarter after going against Davis in the
low post.
</P>
<P>
Larry Johnson (25 points, seven rebounds) and Kurt Thomas (10
points, eight rebounds) had strong games in Ewing's absence, but
New York couldn't make the plays it needed down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
Needing someone to fill the void, the Knicks got it from
Johnson in the second quarter. Often guarded by Austin Croshere,
Johnson repeatedly got the better of the matchup and scored eight
points in the period. Chris Childs added seven points to help New
York to a 43-42 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Miller scored eight points in the third quarter to keep it
close, but New York ended the quarter with an 8-2 run for a 66-61
lead entering the fourth.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto to Be Put Under House Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Former Indonesian president
Soeharto will soon be moved to a "secure" state-protected location
and be put under house arrest, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman
said.
</P>
<P>
But Soeharto's family has reportedly refused such a plan.
</P>
<P>
"Soeharto's case is related to human rights issues. Hopefully,
if the case is settled, the confidence of law enforcement will
recover," the Kompas daily Friday quoted Darusman as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a perspective that the settlement of this case
is not as easy as we have predicted," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, clashes between university students and police
erupted again on Thursday afternoon when hundreds of students
tried to approach Soeharto's residence in central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
During the clashes, protesters threw "Molotov cocktails" and
rocks at police guarding Soeharto's house, demanding the
government's seriousness in dealing with the alleged corruption
cases of Soeharto who stayed in power for 32 years before being
forced to step down two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Police used tear gas and sticks to disperse the protesters,
causing at least 12 students injured. At least 10 protesters were
detained.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has been put under city arrest and banned from leaving
the country since early April and he underwent several
investigations at his residence for corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
He is suspected of abusing his authority by issuing decrees and
government regulations to amass funds through seven tax-free
charity foundations he set up and chaired during his 32 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are said to have found evidence that "Soeharto
committed corruption practices during his rule."
</P>
<P>
Darusman also pledged that the 78-year-old man will be brought
to justice before August 10, or before his city arrest status
expires.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Appoints Task Force for Ethnic Harmony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has appointed a Presidential Task Force on Ethnic
Affairs and National Integration to promote ethnic harmony in the
strife-torn island, the official Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Acceptable and pragmatic solutions to the burning issues could
be identified and implemented if all of us will exert our utmost
effort irrespective of petty differences," Kumaratunga was quoted
as saying while addressing the inaugural meeting of the task force.
</P>
<P>
She said Sri Lanka was facing a critical moment in its history
as the country had been placed on a war footing earlier this month
following the worst ever reversals suffered by the armed forces in
their 17-year ethnic war against separatist Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
The 30-member task force is seen as designed to draw in forces
that were hitherto unconcerned with the ongoing war operations. It
comprises representatives of political parties, academics and
administrative and non-governmental sectors.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga presented a draft strategic plan and basic concepts
for the consideration of the task force to work out necessary
guidelines and an action plan to achieve short- and long-term
objectives.
</P>
<P>
The task force was also requested to identify priority areas
for urgent attention by the government as well as the public.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Exposes 275 Drug-Related Cases in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities exposed a
total of 275 narcotic drug-related cases in April this year,
seizing 51.37 kilos of opium and 2.86 kilos of heroin in the month,

<HEADLINE> hke052610--Indonesia Hails U.S. Decision to Resume Military Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi
Shihab has hailed the United States government's decision to
resume its military ties with his country.
</P>
<P>
"That is good. That is one of the foreign minister's successes
that needs to be put on record," Shihab was quoted by national
newspapers Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shihab recently visited the U.S. and met with his counterpart
Madeleine Albright. Indonesian Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono
met with Pentagon officials in Washington in April and expressed
optimism that the U.S. would resume military assistance.
</P>
<P>
Shihab said the U.S. aid plan would include spare parts for
military equipment and education for military personnel.
</P>
<P>
"We said we would open all opportunities in making Indonesia-
America relations without impediments, including the military
relationship," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials in Washington were quoted by the Jakarta Post as
saying that the decision was a result of Indonesia being able to
demonstrate its seriousness in pursuing reform, including that in
the military sphere.
</P>
<P>
Washington's decision comes only after the European Union
lifted its embargo in January and at a time when Indonesia defense
officials have several times asserted that they would look to
countries other than the U.S. in its military dealings.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government suspended all joint military exercises and
exchanges and other support for Indonesia on September 9 last year
to protest the violence which swept East Timor following a
referendum.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Govt Calls On Youth to Join Armed Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
called on the country's youth to join the armed forces and help
protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country,
the Ministry of Defense said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that the government has also
called on retired officers to rejoin the forces for six months of
voluntary service.
</P>
<P>
These include army lieutenants, navy commanders, air force wing
commanders and ranks below them who are under 50 years of age and
also those who had retired from the police force.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers will be posted in non-operation areas.
</P>
<P>
Special benefits have been offered to volunteers and those
already in service. This includes permanent employment in the
public sector once their period of service expires.
</P>
<P>
The need to mobilize more men for the armed forces has arisen

</P>
<P>
-- In an apparent show of solidarity with Sri Lanka, the United
States has reportedly moved an element of its naval task force
from the Gulf towards the southern Arabian sea, highly-placed
sources in the Indian government have said.
</P>
<P>
The Hindustan Times:
</P>
<P>
-- India has clearly said that in no case would its forces
enter the Jaffna war zone for accomplishing the promised

the Palaly airbase where the trapped Sri Lankan soldiers would
have to reach on their own, highly-placed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Express:
</P>
<P>
-- An Indian cabinet reshuffle will take place on Saturday to
fill existing vacancies and readjust portfolios, Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee revealed during an on-line chat show
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Times of India:
</P>
<P>
-- Worried by the sudden surge in volatility in the foreign
exchange markets, which saw the Indian currency rupee tumbling to
a new record low of 44.75/76 against the U.S. dollar in intra-day
trading, the Reserve Bank of India moved swiftly into action,
introducing new measures aimed at putting the brakes on import
demand for foreign exchange and discouraging exporters from
retaining their earnings overseas.

<HEADLINE> Estonian President Says Europe Needs Small Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Estonian President Lennart Meri
said on Thursday that Small European countries can play a positive
role in the development of the continent and urged the European
Union (EU) not to stop expansion.
</P>
<P>
Europe needs small countries as the power of Europe comes from
its diversity, said Meri in an address in Turku, Finland.
</P>
<P>
He said the status of small countries has changed as the EU
expands. Small countries are needed to achieve a balance in Europe,
as they can use their unique means to ease conflicts frequently
seen among big powers.
</P>
<P>
Small countries were once neglected during the development of
Europe, he complained.
</P>
<P>
The EU cannot carry out its internal reforms at the cost of EU
expansion, Meri said. The EU should treat countries who apply for
membership on the basis of equality instead of political mentality,
he indicated.
</P>
<P>
Meri arrived in Finland Thursday to receive an honorary
doctorate from Turku University.

<P>
OTTAWA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A fifth patient died of the massive
outbreak of E. coli 0-157 bacteria on Thursday in Canada's
southern town of Walkerton, Canadian media reported.
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon on Thursday, local health officials confirmed
the death of the latest victim, another elderly person. The other
four patients who died were a baby, an elderly woman and two
unidentified adults.
</P>
<P>
At least 700 people have been affected by the disease and 10
are in a critical condition in what medical workers say is the
worst outbreak in Canada's history.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Murray McQuigge, the local chief medical officer, said a
higher toll is likely since diarrhea, nausea, fever and other
symptoms can take one week to surface.
</P>
<P>
Residents have to drink bottled water and bathe in nearby towns
away from Walkerton's water supply, which is believed to be
contaminated two weeks after the area was flooded in a heavy rain
storm.

HOHHOT, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Officials with the Xilin Gol League,
in central part of north China's Inner Mongolia, recently
announced a plan to strengthen vegetation protection in an area of
380,000 hectares to fight against grassland deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Xilin Gol League has about 20 million hectares of grassland
which have seriously eroded because of dry weather, pests and
overuse. The grass-covered ratio in 1999 was only 27 percent, a
sharp drop from 35 percent in 1984. About 64 percent of grasslands
have deteriorated or become deserts.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the League is to carry out a full-scale
program including planting tree and grass, rotation grazing,
introducing and planting new meadows while protecting them from
pasturing. There are now 40,000 hectares of new meadows in the
Xilin Gol League.

<HEADLINE> China Facing Growing Impact of Red Tides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China has been experiencing
increasing red tides off the Chinese coast since the 1990s due to
increasing pollution caused by industrial waste water, according
to an official report.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, a total of 200 red tides have been
registered and over the past three years there had been 45 major
red tides, causing 240 million U.S. dollars in direct economic
losses, the recently issued annual report by the State Oceanic
Administration of China said.
</P>
<P>
The report predicts that about 20 to 30 red tides are expected
to occur this year in the coastal sea waters, compared with 19
last year.
</P>
<P>
The report is based on the results of China's largest survey
of 2.68 million sq. km of sea waters under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The 45 major red tides occurred in the Bohai Sea, the Yellow
Sea, the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Most of them took
place in the seas off the coasts of Guangdong, Shandong, Zhejiang
and Liaoning provinces and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
About 4 billion tons of industrial waste water are discharged
annually into the sea, resulting in the accumulation of organic
pollutants blamed for the growing outbreaks of disastrous red
tides, the administration said.
</P>
<P>
Red tides may also destroy marine lives and bring harm to
marine cultivation industries.
</P>
<P>
China has monitored a large red tide spotted last week off the
coast of east China's Zhejiang Province, the first discovered this
year in Chinese waters. The red tide covered 1,000 sq. km in the
Zhoushan area between the north latitude of 28 and 29 degrees.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Leader to Visit Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Myanmar State Peace
and Development Council and Prime Minister Senior-General Than
Shwe will pay a goodwill visit to Bangladesh soon to strengthen
bilateral ties and economic cooperation between the two countries,
an official announcement said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe will make the trip at the invitation of Bangladeshi
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for Than Shwe to visit neighboring
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
In September 1995, the two countries initiated formal border
trade at Maungtaw (Myanmar)-Teknaf (Bangladesh) trade point.
Bilateral trade stands at about 8 million U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
During Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad's visit to
Yangon in November 1998, the two countries signed an agreement on
the inland boundary of the northern part of the Naaf River. The
Myanmar-Bangladesh boundary is made up of the Naaf River part and
the inland part.
</P>
<P>
In July 1999, Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win Aung toured
Bangladesh and met with his Bangladeshi counterpart Azad. The two
sides agreed that the problem of repatriation of the remaining
over 20,000 Myanmar Rohingya refugees from southeast Bangladesh
would be solved once a joint commission between the two countries
was established.
</P>
<P>
Both Myanmar and Bangladesh are also members of the BIMST-EC, a
sub-regional economic grouping formed in June 1997 by Bangladesh,
India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand bordering the Bay of Bengal.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- After weeks of calm, communal
clashes erupted again in Galela and Tobelo subdistricts in
Indonesia's North Maluku province on Thursday, according to
reports reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
North Maluku Acting Governor Muhyi Effendi said he had received
reports from different sources in Tobelo that the death toll was
32 and the number of injured was 52, whereas the security forces
had reported only 11 persons were killed and 75 injured.
</P>
<P>
"We will check the difference of the data," Effendi was quoted
by the Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted a church official as saying that the clashes
occurred following an attack by rioters from the sea and hills.
</P>
<P>
The dawn attack by about 2,000 people in white caused panic
among the villagers most of whom were then still asleep. Many of
them were shot and burned to death in their homes.
</P>
<P>
"Several standard military-style weapons were used in the
attack and they also blockaded access to the sea using tens of
speed boats," he said, adding that at least eight of the attackers
died.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 houses and one house of worship were burned.
</P>
<P>
The unrest in the two subdistricts abated gradually after 20
members of the National Defense Forces were deployed in the areas.
</P>
<P>
Pattimura Military Commander Brig. Gen. Max Tamaela, who
oversees Maluku and North Maluku, confirmed the incident.
</P>
<P>
"I've heard about the incident. We have problems there as only
a limited number of security troops are posted in the territory,"
he was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Galela and Tobelo districts in the northern part of Halmahera
island, about 2,800 km northeast of Jakarta, are known as trade
centers on the island. The areas had been rocked by riots but were
in a relatively calm condition over the past couple of months.

BUDAPEST, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Hungary and Russia
rose significantly to 605 million U.S. dollars in the first
quarter of the year, up 65.1 percent from the previous year's
level.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Central Statistics Bureau show that during
the three-month period, Hungary's exports to and imports from
Russia stood at 98.5 million dollars and 506.5 million dollars
respectively, up 30.6 percent and 74.3 percent compared with the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result of price hikes in petroleum and natural gas, which
accounted for the lion's share of the country's imports, Hungary
recorded a trade deficit of 408 million dollars during the three
months, doubling the figure for the same period last year,
although there was not a rise in the quantity of imports.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Hungary and Russia has been on the
decline for years, dropping 26 percent in 1998 from the previous
year and 14.6 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Russia ranks fourth among countries exporting products to
Hungary, but 12th among those importing from that country.

<HEADLINE> Russian Support Vital to Balkan Stability: Italian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said on Thursday that Russia can play a key role in helping
establish lasting peace and stability in the Balkans and that it
should step up its involvement in the process.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Igor Ivanov, on
the sidelines of a NATO summit in Italy's central city of Florence,
Dini also expressed satisfaction with the NATO-Russia talks,
saying that although there were many problems yet to be solved,
the opening of dialogue is an important step.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the two countries shared "similar positions" on
many major international issues. Italy and Russia will have a
chance to elaborate further on these themes on June 5 and 6, when
Russian President Vladimir Putin visits Italy.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers held a two-day meeting in Florence on
Wednesday and Thursday to discuss a whole range of issues
including Washington's proposed national missile defense system,
relations with Russia as well as the question of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov attended the meeting, the first time that the Russian
foreign affairs chief met NATO counterparts after the Western
military bloc launched a war against Yugoslavia, a traditional
ally of Russia, in March 1999. Russia froze relations with NATO
since then.
</P>
<P>
NATO is now eager to mend fences with Russia, trying to
persuade it to allow the opening of a NATO liaison office in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General George Robertson wooed Russia at the eve
of the summit by telling a Russian newspaper, Izvestia, on
Wednesday that NATO and Russia were "strategic partners, not
enemies."

LISBON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Goals from two Brazilians won Porto
their 10th Portuguese Cup soccer title on Thursday as they

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda's Cancer Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Blood tests show that the female
giant panda Dan Dan is suffering from squamous cell carcinoma,
according to doctors from a hospital in Xi'an, capital of
northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Doctors also found another four to five tumors in Dan Dan
during the treatment. The largest tumor is 1.5 centimeters in
diameters.
</P>
<P>
Doctors injected bacteriophage and anti-cancer medicine into
Dan Dan on Wednesday to prolong her life. Doctors have confirmed
that the cancer is not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
Animal experts said that the 29-year-old giant panda is too old
to undergo an operation, thus deciding to use medicine to treat
Dan Dan.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guancheng, deputy head of the Xi'an Zoo said Dan Dan's
condition is stable and she has a normal appetite.
</P>
<P>
Dan Dan was found suffering from cancer on May 8 this year. She
has lived at the zoo for 16 years. She is especially loved by
visitors.
</P>
<P>
Dan Dan has a brown-and-white coat, which is rare for giant
pandas. She is the only such giant panda in captivity in the world.

<P>
NANJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Two electricity transmitting towers,
believed to be the world's highest, are being built across the
Yangtze River in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The two 346.5-meter-high towers with a spanning of 2,303 meters
have created two world records, in terms of their height and
spanning, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The pair of towers are part of the east China power grids which
transmits electricity to the eastern part of China from the
country's western and central areas.
</P>
<P>
As China's most economically developed area, east China has
long suffered from an electricity shortage. The completion of the
power grids are expected to alleviate the power supply pressure in
the region.

<HEADLINE> Expert on E-Commerce Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- When implementing e-commerce,
people need to coordinate and integrate various forces to solve
the difficult and bottleneck problems together, suggested an
expert from an e-commerce company.
</P>
<P>
As a social systematic project, e-commerce is huge and
complicated, especially as it comes to the advanced stage, namely,
when business to business large volume transactions and enterprise
supply chain management are involved, said Lu Shoudun president of
the China Information Highway Corporation, in a signed article in
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the China Information Highway Corporation put
forward the innovative concept of "Beijing E-Commerce City" during
the implementation of the Beijing E-Commerce Project.
</P>
<P>
The company united forces from various sides and made
significant breakthroughs in solving the seven bottlenecks which
had restricted the e-commerce development in China. Those problems
were the certificate authorities (CA) system, payment system,
security configuration, cargo distribution system, legal
environment, interconnected network and transaction platform.
</P>
<P>
With the China Information Highway Corporation as an
intermediary of the integrated economy and a B to B general
solution provider, China Financial CA established by the company
and the 12 commercial banks organized by the people's Bank of
China as the authentication authority for the granting and
management of the electronic certificates.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the growth of e-commerce websites in China is like
bamboo shoots after a spring rain, noted Lu, but warning that up
to now the global e-commerce is far from maturity and confronts
both risk and opportunity in its development, said Lu.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Longmen Grottoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Longmen Grottoes, 13 kilometers
south of Luoyang City in central China's Henan Province, are the
largest caves in China.
</P>
<P>
Built during the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534 A.D.), the
heritage site has 135 grottos, 40 pagodas, 97,000 Buddhist statues
and 3,600 stone sculptures.
</P>
<P>
Guyang, Bingyang and Lianhua are major grottoes. The Bingyang
Grottoes consist of three caves. The middle cave alone took 24
years (500-523 A.D.) to complete. The walls of the entrance to the
cave were once decorated with base-relief carvings of the Emperor
Xuanwu and his wife worshipping Buddha.
</P>
<P>
Among the grottoes carved during later dynasties, an especially
interesting one is the Grotto of Prescription, built in 575 AD.
</P>
<P>
The recipes of a great number of traditional herbal medicines
were carved on the walls, which served to make the Grotto an
encyclopedia of ancient Chinese medical practices.
</P>
<P>
The Grotto of Buddhas was built in 680 AD during the Tang
Dynasty and contains more than 15,000 Buddhist statues.
</P>
<P>
Ancestor-Worshipping Temple is the biggest grotto at Longmen
and was built more than 1,300 years ago by the Emperor Gaozong and
Empress Wu Zetian during the Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The government has applied for the Longmen Grottos to be listed
on the World Heritage List of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Mausoleums of emperors during the
Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties are the best
extant ancient tombs in China.
</P>
<P>
The government has applied for these tombs to be listed on the
World Heritage List of the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
Of the sixteen Ming emperors, thirteen chose to be buried in a
serene valley 44 kilometers north of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Of the 13 tombs, only two have been excavated, those of Chang
Ling (the burial name for Yong Le, 1403-24), and Ding Ling (
Emperor Wan Li, 1562-1620). The Chang Ling Tomb is the largest and
best preserved of the tombs.
</P>
<P>
There are two Qing imperial mausoleums, the eastern tombs and
western tombs located in Zunhua County and Yixian County in north
Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Nine emperors, 24 empresses and other members of imperial
families during the Qing Dynasty were buried in these mausoleums.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Dujiangyan and Mount Qingcheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Dujiangyan, situated on the
Minjiang River near Guanxian County on the Chengdu Plain,
southwest China's Sichuan Province, was built under the direction
of Li Bing, who assumed office as Governor of Sichuan in 250 B.C.
</P>
<P>
Located to the southwest of Dujiangyan, and 73 kilometers from
Chengdu, Mount Qingcheng was named for its surroundings of flush
and green mountains; like the outline of a city.
</P>
<P>
Both Mount Qingcheng and Dujiangyan resorts have applied for
the World Heritage List of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
Dujiangyan, regarded as one of the earliest water conservancy
project in the world, consists of Fish Snout, the primary river-
diverting division-head, Flying Sands Spillway and Cornucopia
Channel.
</P>
<P>
The planning, designing and building of Dujiangyan were
remarkably scientific, original and nearly perfect. Fish Snout,
Flying sands Spillway and Cornucopia Channel co-ordinate to handle
the flow in both flood and low-water seasons for irrigation and
flood prevention.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that as early as 2,300 years ago the Chinese
people had put into practice the "theory of weired flow", or the
admission of a certain volume of discharge at a certain water
level.
</P>
<P>
Mount Qingcheng, famed for its surroundings of flush and green
mountains, is made up of the Front Mountain and the Rear Mountain.
The mountain contains eight caverns and seventy-two caves. It is
one of the birthplaces of Chinese Taoism, with the name of the "
Fifth Unique World" and the fame of "Peaceful Under Heaven".
</P>
<P>
Centered on the Taoist Cavern and the Upper Clarity Temple, the
Front Mountain has many generous, man-made landscapes. These
simple but elegant structures were built to conform to the shape
of the mountains.
</P>
<P>
The Rear Mountain contains many peculiar, natural landscape
features such as piled-up ridges and peaks, green forests, various
mountain shapes, crisscrossing deep valleys, and long-flowing
clean brooks. All these enchanting landscapes are beautiful to the
eyes. The cableway and other tourist facilities make visiting a
pleasure for the tourist.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Pudong to Employ More Talented People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Pudong New Area, an
emerging financial and trade zone set up in the early 1990s, will
employ 200,000 talented people from both home and abroad over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
Specialists in areas like management, finance, trade, insurance,
tourism, law and various high-tech industries are the most sought
after.
</P>
<P>
Pudong, aiming to become an international center of finance and
trade in the new century, has maintained an average annual growth
rate of over 20 percent over the past 10 years, with gross
domestic product reaching 80 billion yuan (about 9.63 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
An official with the administration of Pudong said the area
will enter a comprehensive development phase in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Although more than 200,000 Chinese and foreign professionals
have already been hired during the past decade, the official said,
the area is still short of talented people, especially those in
agriculture, finance, health care, accounting, statistics, law,
and high technology.
</P>
<P>
At least some 50,000 experts are needed for its high-tech
industries including information technology and bio-
pharmaceuticals, according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Name Illinois' Kruger as Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Atlanta Hawks on Thursday
hired Illinois' Lon Kruger as head coach to succeed Lenny Wilkens,
the NBA's all-time wins leader who resigned last month.
</P>
<P>
It was reported by the News-Gazette of Champaign that the deal
was worth approximately 10 million U.S. dollars over five years.
Kruger was being paid annually 750,000 at Illinois, where he had
worked since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Kruger, 47, was a draft pick of the Hawks in 1974 and tried out
with the Detroit Pistons the following year but has no
professional coaching experience.
</P>
<P>
He compiled a 52-59 record at Texas-Pan American from 1982-86,
then guided Kansas State to an 81-46 mark and four straight NCAA
Tournament appearances from 1986-90.
</P>
<P>
Kruger jumped to Florida in 1990 and helped the Gators to a
school-record 29 wins and an NCAA Final Four appearance in 1993-94.
He was 104-80 in six years at Gainesville before taking the job at
Illinois, where he was 81-48 and guided the Fighting Illini to
three NCAA Tournament appearances.
</P>
<P>
Illinois went 22-10 last season and lost to eventual runner-up
Florida 93-76 in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
After trading veteran guards Steve Smith and Mookie Blaylock,
the Hawks went with a youth-oriented team that featured six
players 24 or younger during the past season.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Chelsea admitted for the first time they are interested in
bringing former Leeds striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink to Stamford
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
Hasselbaink, who Leeds sold to Atletico Madrid for 12 million
pounds last season, led the Primera Liga scoring charts for much
of the campaign but his 24 goals failed to save the Spanish giants
from relegation.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea managing director Colin Hutchison said he was given
permission by Atletico to talk to Hasselbaink's agent Humphry
Nijmen.
</P>
<P>
"It is true we have made an enquiry but other clubs are going
down the same road," Hutchison told Chelsea Clubcall.
</P>
<P>
"We were given permission by Atletico to talk to his agent and
open negotiations. That's as far as it's gone although we hope to
take the matter a little bit further," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea are reported to be ready to pay over 14 million pounds
for Hasselbaink, who walked out on Leeds just nine months ago to
move to Spain.
</P>
<P>
But any deal will not be finalised until after Saturday's
Spanish Cup final, which is expected to be the Dutchman's final
game in Spain.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Lewis Won't Ditch Belts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Lennox Lewis has already been
relieved of his WBA heavyweight title belt but the British world
champion insists he has no plans to ditch his other three alphabet
titles.
</P>
<P>
There have been calls in some quarters for Lewis to disown his
WBC, IBF and IBO belts rather than become embroiled in the
ridiculous politics which allow the organisations to call the
shots.
</P>
<P>
Lewis knows his status as 'undisputed' champion and his ability
to command huge purses would not be affected whether he held the
belts or not.
</P>
<P>
But he told ITV2: "I thought about it and realised it took me
10 years to become undisputed champ and to get all these belts.
</P>
<P>
"To give them back like that... couldn't do it, won't do it. If
they want them back they'll have to come and get them in the ring,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Lewis defends his remaining titles against South African Frans
Botha at London Arena on July 15.
</P>
<P>
The organisations' agendas dictate that his next opponent must
be the IBF's number one contender David Tua.
</P>
<P>
Lewis has already been stripped of his WBA belt after a court
case, because he would not accede to their demands to face their
number one-ranked fighter, John Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
Lewis added: "The WBA has saved me money. I don't need their
belt to tell the world and show the Americans I'm the undisputed
champion. They know it and the whole world knows I'm the best on
the planet. They just cheapened the belt and look bad."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Denies Capturing Former Israeli Outpost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese army did not capture a
former Israeli outpost in south Lebanon after the withdrawal of the
Israeli forces on Wednesday, said a Lebanese security source here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss also said Thursday that the
Lebanese forces would not be deployed in south Lebanon unless the
United Nations was sure of the total withdrawal of the Israeli
forces from the region.
</P>
<P>
Western media reported Thursday noon that some 20 Lebanese
soldiers, headed by an army officer, took over an abandoned Israeli
artillery base on the hilltop of Zafaty in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese security officer noted that the Lebanese army unit
entered the destroyed position only for clearing it from munitions
left by the Israeli forces for the safety of the Lebanese citizens
who might visit the scene.
</P>
<P>
Many Lebanese citizens were killed or wounded on Wednesday and
Thursday due to blasts of land-mines and munitions left by the
Israeli forces.

ANKARA -- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy has delivered a
letter to his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem in an effort to make
clear Israeli position on the alleged Armenian genocide and put
bilateral relations back on track.
</P>
<P>
Levy reiterated in the letter that the Israeli government is
clinging to its policy that the alleged Armenian Genocide should be
discussed by historians, not by politicians or diplomats, Turkish
Daily News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ties between the two countries became strained after two
Israeli ministers said Turkey should admit the fact that Armenians
were massacred ethnically by Turks during the first World War.

Armenia is pushing for a bill condemning Turkey and trying to
win sympathy from the world. (Turkey-Israel)

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Defense Ministry issued a statement
Thursday, which said Israel was willing to cede part, not the
whole, of the disputed Shebaa Farms to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The statement was a response to earlier reports by Israeli media
that Prime Minister Ehud Barak had told French President Jacques
Chirac that he was considering withdrawing Israeli troops from the
entire farms.
</P>
<P>
The intended Israeli move was apparently aimed to deprive Syria
of any excuse to encourage Hezbollah guerrillas to continue
military attacks against Israel. Hezbollah has vowed to fight on
until Shebaa farms are returned and Lebanese detainees in Israel
freed. (Israel-Lebanon-Farms)

KIRYAT SHEMONA, Northern Israel -- The Israeli government is
determined to push the Middle East peace process forward after the
troop withdrawal from south Lebanon, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a special session of the Knesset (parliament) which
was held to show solidarity with residents in northern Israel,
Barak said he and his government will "do everything possible" to
realize peace not only in Israel, but in the Middle East as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Barak for the first time called upon Lebanese
people and government to join hands with Israel to maintain border
safety, not to turn south Lebanon into a battle field again after
Israel's troop withdrawal. (Israel-Barak-Peace Process)

JERUSALEM -- Israel's Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein

<P>
Mordechai will be charged with three counts of sexual
harassment, one involving a temporary worker who claimed the
minister assaulted her in his office earlier this year, Rubinstein
said in his decision.
</P>
<P>
A second count involves a similar case while Mordechai was
serving as defense minister in the former government headed by
Benjamin Netanyahu, and the third one, dating back to 1992,
concerns a similar case while he was serving as commander of the
northern front. (Israel-Mordechai-Charges)

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cyprus Modifies Taxes for EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- In a further bid to meet the
accession criteria of the European Union (EU), Cyprus on Thursday
decided to raise the value added tax (VAT) rate of the country.
</P>
<P>
After discussions between the government and the opposition
parties, the House of Representatives (parliament) approved on
Thursday the government proposal to raise the VAT rate from 8
percent to 10 percent as part of a step-by-step approach aimed to
finally bring the rate to the minimum 15 percent of EU criteria.
</P>
<P>
With the VAT increase, the Cyprus government expects to get an
extra 60 million Cyprus pounds (120 million U.S. dollars) in
revenues annually.
</P>
<P>
But the main opposition AKEL party and the Social Democratic
Party voted against the proposal.
</P>
<P>
AKEL argued that the VAT hike was not necessary and that savings
could be made through more effective tax collection as well as the
introduction of corporation tax in line with EU policies.
</P>
<P>
It also said inflation rate of the country in 2000 would rise to
4.5 percent from 1.7 percent in 1999 as the result of the VAT hike
and the recent increase in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
However, the government pledged to lift the tax-free threshold
to 6,000 pounds (12,000 dollars) from the current 5,000 pounds (10,
000 dollars) and modify income tax scales. Finance Minister Takis
Clerides also announced that the minimum pension would be raised 10
percent and inheritance tax would be abolished.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Cyprus also decided to scrap all tax advantages for
foreign companies operating on the island by the end of 2005.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies operating in Cyprus are now taxed by 4.25
percent on net profits. But tax rates for domestic companies are
fixed at between 20 and 25 percent of the annual turnover.
</P>
<P>
According to EU standard, company tax rates for local and
foreign companies must be at the same level.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that the tax rates of 10-12 percent of net
profits could still keep foreign companies in Cyprus. However, such
a scenario involves lowering the tax on local companies also to
that level, which would mean a heavy loss in state revenues.
</P>
<P>
President Glafcos Clerides acknowledged that the decision to
scrap tax advantages will affect the operation of foreign companies
on the island, but he said Cyprus has no other choice but to comply
rather than to complicate the EU accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, along with Slovenia, Hungary, Poland, Estonia and the
Czech Republic, started substantive accession negotiations with the
EU in November 1998. It hopes to be admitted to the bloc in January
2003.
</P>
<P>
With 15 chapters of the Cyprus-EU negotiations already
concluded, 10 under negotiations and only four pended, the island's
accession talks with the EU are well ahead of other applicant
countries.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Vows to Continue Fight Against Israel for Return of Shebaa Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of Hezbollah Hassan
Nasrallah vowed Friday to continue fighting against Israel if the
Jewish state failed to withdraw from Shebaa Farms and release
Lebanese prisoners in Israel, ANN television station reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The enemy continues to detain our brothers in its prisons and
occupy land of us, the Shebaa Farms," Nasrallah told a rally in the
town of Bint Jbeil in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas attacked Israeli positions in Shebaa Farms
on Sunday for the first time since 1989 when the guerrillas killed
four Israeli officers in Jabal Lus in the region.
</P>
<P>
The fertile Shebaa Farms are located on the Lebanese side of
Mount Hermon, now under Israeli occupation. Israel said the farms
belong to Syria, and that a withdrawal from the area would be
considered in its peace talks with Damascus.
</P>
<P>
According to a British-French agreement on the Lebanese-
Palestinian border in 1923, the Shebaa Farms were not included in
the Lebanon side. But Lebanon claimed that the area was bequeathed
to Beirut in an agreement between Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah said that Israel has no choice but pull out its forces
from all occupied Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to his audience that the some 20 prisoners in
Israeli prisons will be released and the land will return to
Lebanon through resistance fight with Israel.
</P>
<P>
After Hezbollah guerrillas seized most Israeli abandoned
positions and many ammunitions in south Lebanon, the guerrillas'
leader said his movement will not should security role in the
south. "The region has come back under the state authorities, and
it is up to the state to decide what measures to take", he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, he called for solidarity in various sects and
denied alleged reports about Christians suffering from retaliation
from Muslims after the Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
Christians in south Lebanon are regarded by Muslim as supporters
to Israel's surrogate militia, the South Lebanon Army (SLA), which
fought side by side with Israel to control the so-called security
zone in south Lebanon in the past two decades but collapsed after
the recent Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded and occupied south Lebanon in 1978 and set up a
security zone there in 1985 with a self-claimed aim of protecting
its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks. Since
then, the Hezbollah guerrillas have been spearheading a war to oust
the Israeli occupation forces and the SLA.

<HEADLINE> U.N., Preparatory Commission Conclude Agreement to Regulate Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- An Agreement to Regulate the
Relationship between the United Nations and the Preparatory
Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Organization (
CTBTO) was signed here Friday by the commission's executive
secretary, Wolfgang Hoffman, and the U.N. Secretary-General, Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
This is the first relationship agreement which the United
Nations has concluded with a preparatory commission, or
organization preparing for the establishment of another
international organization, which, in the case of the Preparatory
Commission, is the future CTBTO.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first relationship agreement the United Nations
has concluded with an autonomous international organization
responsible for verification activities since the conclusion of
the relationship agreement between the United Nations and the
International Atomic Energy Agency in 1957.
</P>
<P>
Although the Preparatory Commission is not part of the United
Nations system, the conclusion of this agreement brings the
Preparatory Commission into formal working relationship with the
United Nations and provide a framework for cooperation between the
two organizations.
</P>
<P>
This cooperation will facilitate the Commission's task of
carrying out the necessary preparations for the effective
implementation of the CTBTO. The agreement thus represents an
important milestone for the Commission's work.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the agreement, the two organizations agree to
cooperate closely and to consult and to maintain a close working
relationship on matters of mutual interest and concern.
</P>
<P>
As is customary in relationship agreements concluded between
international organizations, the agreement provides for reciprocal
representation of the executive heads of each organization or
their representatives at meetings convened by the other
organization.
</P>
<P>
Each organization may propose agenda items for the
consideration of the other and exchange information, publications
and documents of mutual interest. The Commission also undertakes
to keep the United Nations informed of its activities.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will enter into force upon its approval by the
Preparatory Commission and the U.N. General Assembly. The
Preparatory Commission has approved the agreement during its
eleventh session held on May 2-5 and it is expected that the
General Assembly will consider the issue during the present
session, which is to end in September.

<HEADLINE> Mandelson Urges Unionists to "Avoid Tragedy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary Peter
Mandelson Friday urged the Ulster Unionists to return to devolved
government in a speech which was delayed because of a hoax bomb
alert.
</P>
<P>
The Killyhevlin Hotel in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh of
Northern Ireland was evacuated before Mandelson was due to speak
at lunchtime on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The hotel was the target of a bomb attack in 1996 during the
first ceasefire by the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
The Continuity IRA, which is opposed to the current peace
process, was blamed for it, but the paramilitary organization did
not admit the attack.
</P>
<P>
When he gave his speech later in the afternoon, Mandelson
called on the Ulster Unionists to go back into devolved government
with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
He made the comment on the eve of an Ulster Unionist ruling
council meeting, which would be a "defining moment which would
determine the course of politics in the province for very many
years to come".
</P>
<P>
"It would be a tragedy to abandon progress made since the
signing of the Good Friday Agreement, which had laid the
foundations for a society to break free forever from centuries of
fear", he added.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, he said, put the people of Northern Ireland in
control of their own future, offering the opportunity of permanent
peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Britain suspended a powersharing home rule government in
February when the IRA failed to disarm.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Dismisses Unionist Alternative Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- As Ulster Unionists prepared to vote
on a return to power-sharing in Northern Ireland, the party leader,
David Trimble Friday dismissed a rival plan of action.
</P>
<P>
Trimble has been campaigning to persuade the 860 members of the
Ulster Unionist Council to accept a return to full devolution
before their meeting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But hardline Ulster Union Party MP Jeffrey Donaldson has
written to council members advising them the party should not
share power with Sinn Fein until arms decommissioning has started.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing Donaldson's plan, Trimble said two years of
negotiation since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement showed
that other parties would not accept such a "unionist wish list".
</P>
<P>
"There are many safe attractive options. We could all sit here -
and indeed sometimes in the past we have done - and draw up a
unionist wish list," he said.
</P>
<P>
Trimble added he was interested to note that Donaldson's
proposals were presented as an alternative way of implementing the
agreement, and not an alternative to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident that he would win Saturday's vote and
said he hoped, that rather than causing further division, the
decision would be one the party could unite around.
</P>
<P>
Donaldson said his alternative plan was a "genuine and sincere
attempt" to avoid party divisions.
</P>
<P>
There must be credible and verifiable decommissioning by the
Irish Republican Army before his party re-entered government with
Sinn Fein, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that in the interim the currently suspended
assembly could work on preparation for a program of government.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed a mechanism to exclude paramilitary-linked
parties from an assembly unless decommissioning happened within an
agreed timetable.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, UUP deputy leader John Taylor said he had still not
made up his mind which way he would vote.
</P>
<P>
In response to Donaldson's plan, Sinn Fein chief negotiator
Martin McGuinness said no more conditions should be put on
restoring the executive.
</P>
<P>
The power-sharing executive was suspended in February because
of an impasse over IRA arms decommissioning.

Natural Resources Minister Friday broke his long-standing silence
and announced he will contest the presidency of the ruing party in
the general election, which is to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
He told a gathering at his Lusaka home that there was no clause
in the constitution of the ruling Movement for Multi-Party
Democracy (MMD) to give any person power to decide on who could
run for what office.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that President Frederick Chiluba had emphatically
insisted that he would exercise his power to choose a candidate
for the party.
</P>
<P>
Mwila also emphasized the need to build up good governance in
the party, stressing that freedom and democracy are essential
ingredients in the social-economic development of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Some MMD officials and former parliament members attended the
gathering.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, one of the country's richest men, owning a business
empire spanning from manufacturing to finance, helped Chiluba
defeat former President Kenneth Kaunda in the 1991 elections.
</P>
<P>
He is widely considered by some political observers here as a
powerful figure in the next year's general elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiluba has indicated in the past that he would not
allow Mwila to become the next president.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Parents Urged to Help Youths Free From Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian parents have been urged to
make their efforts, through increased care and supervision, to
help stem the increase in youths' participation in the drugs
business as couriers.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Iliya Lokadaang, Chairman of Nigeria's
National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), in a statement to
commemorate the country's children and youths day, which falls on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lokadang said that youths, as drug couriers, constituted a
sizable proportion of drug-traffickers because of inadequate
parental care and counseling.
</P>
<P>
"The youths of today are trapped in all sorts of vices as a
result of inadequate parental care," said the NDLEA boss, adding
results of surveys indicated that the youths are willing to offer
themselves to ferry drugs for intangible benefits, not minding the
dire consequences they would face upon arrest.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that parents and guardians had a great role to
play in the mission to salvage the youths and restore the
country's image, stressing that they should not seek material
acquisition at the expense of their children's upbringing.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Foreign Ministers to Amend Sub-regional Security Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the west
African sub- region Friday met in Nigeria's capital Abuja to amend
a fledgling sub- regional security mechanism in a bid to address
new instabilities in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
A report received here quoted Lansana Kouyate, Executive
Secretary of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), as saying at the opening of the meeting that the current
situation in Sierra Leone posed new questions on the mechanism'
ability to do a sound job in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 16-member ECOWAS decided at their 22nd summit in
Lome last year to create a sub-regional security mechanism
consisting of a 10- member council, a crisis monitoring network
and a stand-by multinational forces.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism has not been fully established by far.
</P>
<P>
Ministers are also expected, during the meeting, to discuss the
status of implementation of a regional moratorium, signed last
year, to halt the proliferation of arms in the sub-region, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
According to rough ECOWAS statistics, there are about 10
million illegal arms circulating in the sub-region, which is
believed to be at least part of the cause for the recurrence of
conflicts in some areas of the sub- region.

<HEADLINE> OAS Asked to Lead Verification Mission in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Congress President Miguel
Pinedo proposed Friday the Organization of American States (OAS)
to lead a mission of international verification for the peace
process of his country.
</P>
<P>
Pinedo said that a group of former Latin American chiefs of
State could make up the mission, led by former Colombian president
and now OAS general secretary Cesar Gaviria.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian congressman said in a statement published in
Bogota that it is proper and timely to establish an international
verification mission with former Latin American presidents led by
Gaviria.
</P>
<P>
He said that an international mission can develop a more
decided activity, taking part in the Colombian peace process, in
which the whole world is interested.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian Congress president proposal was made at a time in
which the government plans to resume the peace process with the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and to start a
dialogue with the National Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
The decades long civil war has claimed thousands of lives in
the South American country.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government, FARC to Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Peace negotiations between President
Andres Pastrana and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (
FARC) suspended 11 days ago will be resumed next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached Friday during a meeting held by high
commissioner for peace Camilo Gomez and the guerrilla group leader
Manuel Marulanda Velez, as reported by Raul Reyes, FARC spokesman
in the negotiations table.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks had been suspended since May 15, when Elvia
Cortes, a 53-year-old peasant woman, was assassinated with a
necklace of explosives that unidentified assailants put around her
neck to pressure her relatives to pay a 7,500-dollar extortion.
</P>
<P>
The police and the army charged the FARC with the crime, but
the guerrilla group rejected the accusation. President Pastrana
then announced the suspension of an international hearing on the
problem of illicit cultivates and the environment, scheduled for
Monday, to be attended by delegates of 22 countries.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Gomez exonerated the guerrilla and the attorney
general office announced Thursday that it has evidence that clears
the FARC of the assassination charge, and that the perpetrators
are probably the members of a band of criminals.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks started on January 7, 1999, have concentrated
so far in the search of solutions to the problem of the economic
crisis and the high levels of unemployment, above 29 percent of
the population.

<HEADLINE> Forced Elections Threaten Peru-U.S. Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The absence of free elections in Peru
will unavoidably affect the relations between this Andean country
and the United States, said Friday a press release distributed by
the United States embassy in this capital.
</P>
<P>
The communique quotes statements made Friday morning in
Washington by President Bill Clinton, who deplored the Peruvian
electoral authorities decision of not to postpone the second round
election scheduled for this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Clinto said that the National Elections Jury (JNE) decision
was adopted despite well documented concerns expressed by the
Organization of American States (OAS) observers mission, said the
U.S. embassy's press release.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. embassy bulletin, a postponement, even
for a short time, would have given the OAS mission an opportunity
to observe the electoral process with more confidence, after it
was called fraudulent by opposition candidate Alejandro Toledo.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy also called correct the OAS observers mission
decision of not taking part in Sunday's run-off election, which
will be held with President Alberto Fujimori as the sole candidate,
who aspires to a third mandate.
</P>
<P>
It adds that free, fair, and open elections are the basis for
any democratic society and that in the absence of these laments
the relations between the United States and the government of Peru
will be seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
The communique also warned Peru that Washington is consulting
with other countries of the hemisphere and with the international
community to determine the appropriate steps to follow.

<HEADLINE> (Updates )U.S. Middle School Student Kills Teacher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The incident was the latest act of violence in a U.S. school
after a spate of mass school shootings in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Police Chief William Smith as saying that
seventh grader Nathaniel Brazill was sent home for disrupting
class by throwing water balloons.
</P>
<P>
The student returned to Lake Worth Community Middle School
Friday afternoon, made comments to the teacher and pulled out a
small handgun and fired a single shot.
</P>
<P>
Barry Grunow, 35, of Lake Worth, was shot in the face, said
Mabel Cardec, a spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County School Board.
</P>
<P>
The student was detained and nobody else was hurt in the
incident at the middle school, which teaches children aged from 11
to 15.
</P>
<P>
Lake Worth is just south of West Palm Beach. The school has
about 1,500 students. It is a community school because adult-
education classes are held there in the evenings.
</P>
<P>
The incident was bound to renew anxiety among parents and
children in America, shocked by a series of mass shootings. The
worst incident was on April 20 last year in Littleton, Colorado
State, when two students rampaged through Columbine High School,
killing 13 people before taking their own lives.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell slightly
Friday as investors were reluctant to move into the market ahead
of three day weekend for Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 24.68 at 10,299.24,
extending its loss of 211.43 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 0.24 at 3,205.11 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 3.50 at 1,378.02.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft fell as the U.S. Justice Department pushed anew to
have Microsoft split into two companies in a response to an order
by a Federal judge two days ago to revise its plan to break up the
computer software maker. The Microsoft's antitrust case dragged
stocks lower Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Concerns about Goldman Sachs' earnings continued to hit the
financial sector today. A Wall Street analyst warned Thursday that
the company was likely to miss its earnings target of 1.47 U.S.
dollars per share in the second quarter and the warning drove
financial stocks lower that day.
</P>
<P>
But reports on the U.S. economic data made the market fresh and
slowed stocks' falling. The Commerce Department reported that
orders to U.S. factories for durable goods fell 6.4 percent in
April, the biggest drop since December 1991, while Americans'
spending in the same month rose at its slowest pace in nine months.
</P>
<P>
The reports showed a sign of slowdown in the economy and thus
eased fears about higher interest rates. The Federal Reserve has
raised rates sixth times since last June in an effort to cool off
the economy and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 0.91 at 628.89 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 2.08 at 881.41. But Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 1.20 at 457.37.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,503 up, 1,389 down and 481
unchanged.

<P>
NYSE volume declined to 719.88 million shares from 970.48
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reports Calm Situation on Border Between Israel And Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Friday that the situation is calm on the Border between
Israel and Lebanon and U.N. troops are now patrolling the region
and had moved closer to the Border.
</P>
<P>
"I think things are going quite well. The situation is very
calm on the border," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
" I have spoken to the leaders in the region. I have been in
constant touch with Prime Minister Barak (Israel) and President
Lahoud (Lebanon), and they are cooperating well with my people,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese have started deploying police, administrators and
investigators to the South," the Secretary-General said.
</P>
<P>
"We are now hoping that once we have certified that Israel has
completely withdrawn, they would also begin sending in some army
elements and then of course I am working with the Member States to
send in reinforcements for UNIFIL(United Nations Interim Force In
Lebanon)," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"We have already began our work in verifying that they (
Israeli troops) have indeed withdrawn. So the verification should
be coming very shortly," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
 The last Israeli troops returned home Wednesday, ending
Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon which lasted for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
 Annan has recommended to the United Nations Security Council
that UNIFIL be reinforced to verify Israel's complete withdrawal
from southern Lebanon and to maintain order there.
