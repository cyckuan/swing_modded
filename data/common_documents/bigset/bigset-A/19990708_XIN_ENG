Clinton has said he would outline his views right after
talking to Bakar.

<HEADLINE> Lightning Sparks Apartment Fire in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Fires believed to have been
sparked by lightning gutted more than 100 apartments in the
Atlanta area in Georgia State in southeast United States Tuesday
night, said reports reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A fire that began on the roof of one building of the Post
Terrace Apartments north of Atlanta destroyed 56 units. The fire
quickly worked its way down the four-story structure until it
consumed the entire building.
</P>
<P>
Firewalls helped keep the blaze from spreading to other
buildings in the 296-unit complex, the reports quoted Fulton
County Police Terry Mulkey as saying.
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported. At least 60 residents were forced to
spend the night at a nearby hotel.
</P>
<P>
A band of powerful thunderstorms was believed to have sparked
the blaze and other less severe fires throughout the area.
Lightning lit up the sky throughout the city as sheets of water
poured down on motorists during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
Fires also destroyed 16 units of an apartment building and
damaged 16 more in another building. Twelve units were destroyed
in a fire at a fourth apartment complex. Several houses also
caught fire.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday met in a closed-door session to discuss a report,
presented by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last Friday, on the
latest development of the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled meeting came one day after Libya demanded an
immediate lifting of the U.N. sanctions, imposed in 1992 and
toughed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Libyan Permanent Representative to the United Nations Abuzed
Omar Dorda said in his nine-page letter to the Security Council
Tuesday, "The politicization of this legal dispute, in whatever
form or by anyone, is not acceptable."
</P>
<P>
Before walking into the Security Council chamber, the Libyan
ambassador told reporters the sanctions "should be lifted, because
Libya really met all its obligations that were in the Security
Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"So, there is no more reason at all to delay the lifting," he
said, "If there is anyone who has his own interests" in connection
with the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish town
of Lockerbie, Libya would like to solve the problem bilaterally
through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in his report that Libya had promised to cooperate
with a trial of the two suspects and pay compensation if the two
suspects, handed over on April 5 for trial before a Scottish court
in the Netherlands, were convicted.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. chief said that the United States needed more
evidence before it would agree to lifting the sanctions, mainly
because the trial of the two suspects will not start before
February 2000.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, which include an air and arms embargo and a ban
on oil equipment, were suspended on April 5, when Tripoli
surrendered for trial before the Scottish court in the
Netherlands. The two Libyans were accused of planting a bomb on
Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie. A total of 270 people were
killed in the explosion, 189 of them were Americans.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Constitutional Commission Promises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Zimbabwean
Constitutional Commission Godfrey Chidyausiku said Wednesday that
the views of all Zimbabweans will be contained in the final report
on constitution reform.
</P>
<P>
"The commission is above partisan politics," he told a press
conference in Zimbabwean capital Harare.
</P>
<P>
"We aim at bringing a democratic constitution by ensuring that
all the people of this country are heard," said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
"There is no hidden agenda and there are no interfering
fingers, political or other kind from any authority or quarter,"
he said. "Everything we are doing is above board and will continue
to be so until we complete the historic task before us."
</P>
<P>
Chidyausiku said the commission is driven by national interests
and not views of a few vocal groups.
</P>
<P>
The chairman emphasized the need for people to understand that
the commission is not a review body because they are drafting
totally new law.
</P>
<P>
The commission's mandate is to collect people's views and make
recommendations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to donors to provide financial assistance to enable
the commission to carry out its mission without hurdles.
</P>
<P>
The commission requires 600 million Zimbabwean dollars (15
million U.S. dollars) for its work which would last until November
30, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty of Rwanda Genocide Suspect Repelled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Court of Appeals in southwest
Rwanda has acquitted a former government official who had been
sentenced to death by the criminal court last year, the Rwanda
News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Theodore Munyengabe, 41, had been found guilty of eight counts
of genocide and crimes he perpetrated in the April-July 1994 in
spearheading the mass killings of about 50,000 minority ethnic
Tutsis who had sought refugee at various local Catholic churches
and the soccer stadium.
</P>
<P>
The court was quoted as arguing that Munyengabe did not have
any defense counsel during the trial, and therefore repelled the
death penalty sentence.
</P>
<P>
Munyengabe's acquittal was the second of that kind after the
Kigali's Appeals Court acquitted a Burundi citizen, Leonidas
Ndikumana, who had been sentenced to death for his involvement in
the killings of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Gikondo suburb of
capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Since their opening in December in 1996, Rwandan criminal
courts tried over 1,500 genocide suspects, among whom over 300
were sentenced to death, and over 400 to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two genocide culprits were publicly executed around the
country last April.

<HEADLINE> India Asks Pakistan to Withdraw Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Indian caretaker Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee said Wednesday that India would watch for the
results of Pakistan's intention to withdraw from the Indian side
of the Line of Control (LOC) in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference of chief ministers here, Vajpayee said,
"We are informed that Pakistan has agreed to withdraw. We will
watch for results on the grounds. In the meantime our operations
shall continue unabated."
</P>
<P>
India launched a big military operation in early May to "flush
out Pakistan-backed infiltrators" from the Indian side of the LOC"
and the fighting is still going on in the Kargil sector of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Media reports on Sunday said U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in their talks reached an
agreement and Pakistan promised to withdraw its troops.
</P>
<P>
The chief ministers were briefed on the current situation in
Kargil by the chiefs of the armed forces, Defense Minister George
Fernandes, Home Minister L. K. Advani and Finance Minister
Yashwant Sinha.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee allayed concerns expressed by political parties that
the government had accepted third-party mediation on Kargil,
saying India had made it clear that "there is no room for
third-party involvement, however well-intentioned."
</P>
<P>
He said India had been in close touch with the international
community to give diplomacy a chance to enable New Delhi to
achieve the objective of complete and unconditional withdrawal of
the Pakistan forces. This was not internalization of the Kashmir
question, he added.
</P>
<P>
After expressing satisfaction over the reaction of the
international community, Vajpayee said, "No outsider owes it to us
to reverse the present incursions. We alone are responsible for
safeguarding our security and protecting our interests. While we
are grateful for the support and understanding of the
international community, there will be no compromise on our
military operations."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Rules Out Leadership Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Wednesday dismissed speculations by some sections of the media
that there was a leadership crisis following the death of
Vice-President Joshua Nkomo.
</P>
<P>
"There is no crisis at all and I do not think the issue is a
controversial one," he told journalists in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Taking into consideration that the country's constitution was
to be reviewed and the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union
(Patriotic Front) Congress would meet in December this year, there
was no hurry in trying to determine who was going to replace
Nkomo, said the president.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to the Congress to decide the way forward on the
issue of succession and also taking note of the changes that may
come after the constitutional review," the Zimbabwe News Agency
quoted Mugabe as saying.
</P>
<P>
There is a provision in the Zimbabwean constitution that there
should be two vice-presidents.
</P>
<P>
Following the death of Nkomo there is only Simon Muzenda as
Vice- President.
</P>
<P>
There have been numerous media reports about a leadership
crisis within the ruling party following the death of Nkomo last
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Popular Iranian Moderate Daily Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran's most popular moderate daily
Salam (Hello) was closed down on Wednesday by Iranian
conservative-dominated judiciary, the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the closure decree was announced by
the judiciary through telephone call to the daily, which has
strongly supported President Mohammad Khatami since his election
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The closure came one day after Salam reported in its front
page that Saeed Emami (also famous as Islami), one of the main
agents behind serial political killings in the country, has
proposed to amend the country's press law in order to control the
press.
</P>
<P>
Salam said that Emami, former deputy intelligence minister for
security affairs, sent a letter last October to then intelligence
minister, calling on the ministry to raise proposals to amend the
press law.
</P>
<P>
Emami, who was arrested for masterminding killings of several
Iranian dissidents, committed suicide in prison on June 19 by
taking depilatory substance while taking a bath.

BANGKOK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- All star shuttlers stormed into the
third round after matches on the second day of the World Grand
Prix Thailand Open Badminton Championships on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jun of China, top seed of the men's singles, beat his
Singaporean rival comfortably 15-6, 15-2, while his compatriot Dai
Yun, women's top seed, also proved too strong for local shuttler
Orathai Lapleungthong with a 11-1, 11-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese saw only two losses on Wednesday from Luo Yigang in
the men's singles and Yao Jie in the women's.

Chinese coach Tian Bingyi said Luo, who is suffering belly
injury, lost 4-15, 14-15 to joint 3/4 seed Rachid Sidek of
Malaysia, whom he just beat in the Malaysia Open a week ago.
</P>
<P>
But Yao's defeat could only be attributed to her unsatisfactory
performance, Tian said.

Fung Permadi of Chinese Taipei, second seed for men's singles,
also entered the next round.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Unveils New tariff Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Tariff Commission of Zimbabwe
Wednesday unveiled a new tariff structure which seeks to enhance
competitiveness and export growth of the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The new tariff structure proposed that rates of duty on
international goods, parts and tools which are pegged at 15 to 30
percent, five to 15 percent and 15 percent respectively be pegged
at between 10 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the new structure the commission also proposed that duty for
 protected goods including all sensitive products which are pegged
at 60 to 100 percent be revised to 40 to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the commission proposed retaining duty on other
capital and merit goods, raw materials and primary goods, finished
goods which are currently pegged at zero to five percent, five
percent and 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Addressing representatives from various sectors at a one-day
tariff review consultative workshop in Harare, Zimbabwean Tariff
Commissioner Owen Tshabangu said the proposed tariff structure is
expected to open up room for small- and medium-scale businesses
which have been disadvantaged by the current structure.
</P>
<P>
"This new structure is the bench-mark for further tariff reform
which will ultimately lead to low or relatively uniform structure
in the future," said the commissioner.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Kurds in Lebanon
Wednesday held a demonstration here, demanding the Turkish
government to reverse the death sentence passed on the Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The number of the demonstrators was put at 7,000, including
Kurdish children, women and elderly. They marched one kilometer
from Cora area in southern Beirut to the nearby United Nations
building.
</P>
<P>
Some protesters shouted anti-Turkish government slogans,
carrying pro-Ocalan banners and his portraits.
</P>
<P>
They submitted a statement to U.N. representatives, asking the
intervention of the U.N. for the release of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Turkish court handed down the death sentence on
Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) on charges
of treason and separatism.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government held Ocalan responsible for the deaths
of 37,000 people in the Kurds' 15-year-old guerrilla war for
autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
</P>

Tens of thousands of Kurds are living in Lebanon, of which
25,000 have been granted Lebanese citizenship since the 1950s.

<HEADLINE> Libya to Resume Normal Ties With Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Libyan diplomat
said here Wednesday that Tripoli will soon resume normal relations
with Britain and it was time for the United Nations to lift
sanctions against his country.
</P>
<P>
Abuzed Omar Dorda, the Libyan permanent representative to the
United Nations, told reporters that a resumption of ties with
Britain, announced by British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook. "is
the natural thing."
</P>
<P>
"Libya did not cut relations with any country. We will have
normal relations with Britain and we will establish diplomatic
relations soon," said the Libyan ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Dorda made the remarks in response to Cook's Wednesday
announcement that London was resuming diplomatic relations with
Libya after Tripoli agreed to cooperate in police investigation
into the 1984 shooting of a British policewoman outside the Libyan
Embassy in London.
</P>
<P>
Cook told parliament that Libya had also agreed to pay
compensation for the killing in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner
over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988 after the two
Libyan suspects are convicted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dorda said that the sanctions should be lifted
permanently because "Libya really met all its obligations towards
Security Council resolutions so there is no more reason at all to
delay the lifting."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when the U.N. Security Council is meeting
in a closed-door session to discuss a report by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who said in the report last Friday
that Libya had complied with many of the 15-nation Council's
demands but that he was unable to make a recommendation on lifting
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Britain ended its diplomatic relations in 1984 after a
policewoman was shot outside the Libyan Embassy in London, but
British officials have met Libyan envoys many times since then.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Unsatisfied with Barak's Peace Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon Wednesday expressed
unsatisfaction with the remarks made by Israel's newly-elected
Prime Minister Ehud Barak about reviving the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't Barak mention the United Nations Resolution 425
when he talked about his intention to withdraw Israeli forces out
of Lebanon?" said Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss when meeting
with local visitors.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be so pessimistic when many people are
showing optimism toward the reactivation of the peace talks in
the region," Hoss added.
</P>
<P>
Addressing to parliament before being sworn in on Tuesday,
Barak said his government intends to withdraw Israeli forces out
of Lebanon and make peace with all Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
to oust Israeli forces and its proxy militia South Lebanon
Army out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Last year, former Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu,
who was blamed for the stalemate in the peace process during his
three-year tenure, adopted Resolution 425 which calls on
Israel to withdraw it troops from south Lebanon unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
However, it linked the pullout with security guarantees made by
the Lebanese government in a bid to protect its north against
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, a main power broker in Lebanon, rejected
the offer, demanding the Jewish state to implement the resolution
without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
Hoss stressed that Lebanon will continue to be committed to
achieving just and comprehensive peace in the region and will
insist that talks restart from where they broke off.

<HEADLINE> S. African Bonds Stand Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- South African bonds Wednesday
continued to hover around the 14-percent level, but appear to be
finding it tough to break through this key level.
</P>
<P>
The yield on the benchmark 150 rand (25 U.S. dollars) bond
ended at 14. 080 percent after the 50 basis point rate cut
announcement by Standard Bank had raised hopes of breaching the
key 14-percent level after a best level of 14 percent was tested
at midday. It was at 14.160 percent at Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said bonds had already discounted the interest rate cut
and the fact that the Dow Jones had started on a negative footing
spoiled the prospects of breaking 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Standard Bank Wednesday announced a 50 basis point interest
rate cut to 17.5 percent with effect from July 14.
</P>
<P>
The short-term interest rates have been lending support on the
bond market.
</P>
<P>
If the global markets close average in relation to the Dow
Jones, Emerging Market Bond Index and other indicators, South
African bonds stand a great chance to remain firm, market
observers said.
</P>
<P>
The rand was last at 6.05 rand per dollar from 6.0350 at the
previous close and a best level of 5.9790 Tuesday, while equities
were struggling to go firmer Wednesday on the gold slump.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Denies Mistreatment of Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
Wednesday denied that refugees in its country have been dealt with
unfairly, defending that refugees have been treated in compliance
with the law.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs Bernard S.
Mchomvu was commenting on the latest report by the Human Rights
Watch organization which said that Tanzania has violated human
rights by confining refugees to camps unfairly.
</P>
<P>
The report alleged that the Tanzanian army conducted a
house-to-house check in refugee camps largely in late 1997 and
early 1998 on the grounds that this was necessary to protect
Tanzanian citizens living near the border with Burundi.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Executive Director of the Africa Division of
Human Rights Watch Peter Takirambudde said that Tanzania has a
long and generous tradition of hospitality to refugees, but there
exists cases that refugees are dragged from their homes and
treated like criminals solely because they are refugees.
</P>
<P>
Mchomvu said that Tanzania has a generous tradition of
hospitality especially in the handling of refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country last year amended the National
Refugees Act of 1966, and the new law has a special provision that
refugees must be taken care of in a particular area instead of
being mixed with the citizens.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary observed that the government will not
tolerate any misconduct or criminal actions by refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said when some refugees complained last year that they were
stripped of their belongings and separated from their families,
the Tanzanian and Rwandan governments requested the concerned
refugees to forward their complaints but they have not done so.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 refugees from Burundi, Rwanda, Congo (K) and
other African countries are accommodated in Tanzania.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (xinhua) -- Two U.N.agencies have established
working relationships with the principal U.N. authorities and the
NATO-led peace- keeping mission in Kosovo (K-FOR) leadership, in
order to share information and coordinate activities related to
environment and human settlements in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP) and the U.N. Center for
Human settlements (Habitat) jointly established the Balkans Task
Force (BTF) in May to look at the direct environmental and human
settlements impacts of the conflict in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Pekka Haavisto, BTF Chairman, announced here Wednesday that a
BTF team would soon begin work with the Interim Civil
Administration component of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Haavisto, who was in Kosovo and Macedonia last weekend, said
that following an agreement with the U.N. authorities in the
Balkans, the BTF team would design strategies for local
authorities and communities so that they can effectively
participate in the reconstruction efforts.
</P>
<P>
In Pristina last weekend, Haavisto and his team also met with
commanders of K-FOR. K-FOR has started an assessment of the damage
to human settlements and infrastructure in Kosovo, and agreed to
fully cooperate and share their findings with the planned BTF
mission.
</P>
<P>
The BTF mission, Haavisto said, would travel to the Balkans
region this month and concentrate their work at identified
"hot-spots" of environmental risk at locations in Serbia, Kosovo,
Montenegro, Albania, Macedonia and along the Danube River in
Romania/Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
 An earlier U.N. inter-agency mission to the Balkans
recommended that UNEP, together with Habitat and UNDP, carry out a
detailed assessment of the environmental situation with the aim of
identifying specific needs for targeted assistance.
</P>
<P>
This recommendation was echoed by European Union Environment
Ministers at the Council meeting in Luxembourg last month. The
ministers welcomed the efforts of UNEP/Habitat and said it was
necessary to immediately start obtaining reliable and verifiable
information for assessing the type and extent of environmental
consequences of the conflict.

Wednesday signed an agreement with the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im
Bank) of the United States and the Private Export Funding
Corporation for a long-term credit of 93.8 million dollars for the
Keta Sea Defense project.
</P>
<P>

signed for the United States.
</P>
<P>
 The facility comes with a five-year moratorium on interest

September 2004.
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to bring hope and prevent what could
be catastrophic impact on agriculture, fisheries, commerce and
living conditions of the inhabitants of Keta and surrounding
areas.
</P>
<P>
Miles of land have been lost to the sea which has been lashing
the beaches and causing flooding.
</P>
<P>
 The main components of the construction works to be financed
are Havedzi-Keta main access roads, offshore breakwater at Keta,
groynes and headlands from Kedzi to Keta.
</P>
<P>
 It also provides for beach nourishment, outfall structure at
Kedzi for the lagoon flood control, land reclamation and bird
habitat islands.
</P>
<P>
 Actual construction work is scheduled to take off in
September this year.
</P>
<P>
 The agreement followed Ex-Im Bank's approval of 1.89 million
dollars in 1995 to finance feasibility and engineering study of
the Keta project by Great Lakes Dredge and Dock under the Ex-Im
Bank Engineering Multiplier Program.
</P>
<P>
Ex-Im Bank is an independent U.S. government agency that
assists in financing the export of U.S. goods and services to
industrializing and developing markets all over the world by
providing loans, loan guarantees, and export credit insurance.
</P>
<P>
 Isaac Adjei-Mensah, Minister of Works and Housing, described
the agreement as a major step and an important milestone toward
the implementation of actual constructional works.

Afiadenyigba to Havedzi, the starting point of the wall, to
facilitate early completion of work.
</P>
<P>
 Adjei-Mensah expressed satisfaction at efforts made to
implement the project, saying, "we have come a long way, and
treaded a very difficult path to reach this stage of the Keta Sea
Defense Project today."
</P>
<P>
 He commended the Presidency for its profound interest and
commitment that has seen to the take-off of the project.
</P>
<P>
 Robinson noted that the project is a major one, the largest
civil works by the bank in West Africa in recent years.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen of the 26 members of the
Kisangani- based rebel faction led by ousted leader Ernest Wamba
dia Wamba, has defected to the Congolese rebels in Goma, the
Rwanda News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that Wamba's companions have defected to our side,''
 Vice- President of the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) in
Goma, Moise Nyarugabo, was quoted as saying Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader said that the defectors, led by Willy Mishiki,
a former member of the RCD assembly before the ouster of Wamba,
had been disappointed because Wamba failed to emerge as a leader
of the rebellion at the peace talks in Zambian capital Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Mishiki's group has already signed a letter
distancing themselves from Wamba, said Nyarugabo.
</P>
<P>
Wamba, who is participating in the Lusaka talks aimed at
brokering a cease-fire for the 11-month old conflict, played down
the defection.
</P>
<P>
"We are not aware of the defection. I talked to Mishiki on
Tuesday myself and there was no problem," Wamba was quoted as
saying from Lusaka.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Urged to Intensify Fight Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- African leaders have been urged to
do more to prevent more people from getting infected with AIDS
which has been hindering the development of Africa for about 20
years.
</P>
<P>
Godfrey Sikipa, UNAIDS consultant, made the appeal at the
ambassadors' meeting here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"HIV/AIDS is not only a problem of health, it is also a
development issue. So much has to be done to prevent rampant
spread of the epidemic and to help those already infected," he
told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"The UNAIDS will develop cooperation with OAU to mobilize our
political and community leaders and to mobilize support from the
international community," he added.
</P>
<P>
The UNAIDS wants African leaders to form multi-sectoral
committees in their respective countries and come up with national
strategic plans which can be supported by many other U.N.
agencies.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the reason for the rampant spread of the
deadly disease, the official blamed it on poverty.
</P>
<P>
More than half of Africa's population is now living under the
poverty line and this is the most important factor causing the
problem, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Africa now has 22 million people infected with HIV/AIDS,
accounting for over two thirds of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
The HIV/AIDS rate has been on the rise in most of sub-Sahara
African countries. It can be as high as 30 percent in some of
those countries.

 The project is expected to bring hope and prevent what could
be catastrophic impact on agriculture, fisheries, commerce and
living conditions of the inhabitants of Keta and surrounding
areas.
</P>
<P>
Miles of land have been lost to the sea which has been lashing
the beaches and causing flooding.
</P>
<P>
 The main components of the construction works to be financed
are Havedzi-Keta main access roads, offshore breakwater at Keta,
groynes and headlands from Kedzi to Keta.
</P>
<P>
 It also provides for beach nourishment, outfall structure at
Kedzi for the lagoon flood control, land reclamation and bird
habitat islands.
</P>
<P>
 Actual construction work is scheduled to take off in
September this year.
</P>
<P>
 The agreement followed Ex-Im Bank's approval of 1.89 million
dollars in 1995 to finance feasibility and engineering study of
the Keta project by Great Lakes Dredge and Dock under the Ex-Im
Bank Engineering Multiplier Program.
</P>
<P>
Ex-Im Bank is an independent U.S. government agency that
assists in financing the export of U.S. goods and services to
industrializing and developing markets all over the world by
providing loans, loan guarantees, and export credit insurance.
</P>
<P>
 Isaac Adjei-Mensah, Minister of Works and Housing, described
the agreement as a major step and an important milestone toward
the implementation of actual constructional works.
</P>
<P>
 He said electricity supply has been extended from
Afiadenyigba to Havedzi, the starting point of the wall, to
facilitate early completion of work.
</P>
<P>
 Adjei-Mensah expressed satisfaction at efforts made to
implement the project, saying, "we have come a long way, and
treaded a very difficult path to reach this stage of the Keta Sea
Defense Project today."
</P>
<P>
 He commended the Presidency for its profound interest and
commitment that has seen to the take-off of the project.
</P>
<P>
 Robinson noted that the project is a major one, the largest
civil works by the bank in West Africa in recent years.
</P>
<P>
 Richard Lowry, Chief Operations Officer and Executive
Vice-President of Great Lakes and Dredge, said they are excited by
the project and are looking forward to it.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Sierra Leone Peace Accord Inked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Tejan Kabbah
and rebel leader Foday Sankoh signed a hardly-earned and
long-desired peace accord in Togolese capital Lome on Wednesday
afternoon, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
After signing the accord reached following six weeks' tough
negotiations and a final push-up by a regional mini-summit,
President Kabbah called on his fellow Sierra Leonean people to
learn to "forgive and forget" and to achieve national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The accord, agreed to only on Wednesday morning, stipulates
that the rebels will be disarmed and share power with the elected
Kabbah administration by acquiring several ministerial posts in a
transitional government.
</P>
<P>
But the Nigeria-led west Africa peace-keeping force ECOMOG will
stay in Sierra Leone, according to the document, which was
formerly opposed by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Presidents from Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Liberia and the host
country Togo were present at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The mini-summit, called by Togolese President Gnassingbe
Eyadema, current Chairman of the Economic Community of the West
Africa States (ECOWAS), played an important role in removing the
final hurdles on the road to the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
All parties concerned, including Nigeria who has been leading
the ECOMOG in fighting the Sierra Leonean rebels and Liberia and
Burkina Faso who had been allegedly backing the rebels secretly,
were brought together to made a final push for a lasting peace in
the war-torn west African country.

<HEADLINE> French Court to Re-examine Charge Against Chirac </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A French court in Versailles south of
Paris will re-examine in December a fraud charge sued against
President Jacques Chirac by a Parisien ecologist militant,
reported Agence France-Presse on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The request to examine the case was made by Judge Patrick
Desmure, after Pierre-Alain Brossault and his lawyer
Pierre-Francois Divier launched the charge against Chirac several
months ago.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier judgment made on April 15, Judge Desmure said
that he was incapable of judging a 1993 document signed by Chirac
concerning a wealth tax of a secretary employed by the Municipal
Government of Paris.
</P>
<P>
The accusers said that the document could prove that Chirac was
involved in an alleged fraud committed by the Paris Municipal
Government in creating phantom jobs in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's successor as Mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, has also
been charged with the said fraud.

<HEADLINE> IDB Assists to Improve Highway and Access Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of a soft loan of 52
million U.S. dollars to Bolivia to upgrade a section of the Pan
American Highway, Bolivia Route No.1. as well as to improve access
roads.
</P>
<P>
The resources will be used to help finance the paving and
upgrading of the 84 kilometers of road connecting Ventilla and
Tarapaya and to improve 23 kilometers of road between Tarapaya and
Potosi, the Washington-based bank said.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 150 kilometers of access roads will be improved
along the Ventilla-Tarapaya-Potosi stretch.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to stimulate economic growth in the
highland-area served by the roads, improve access of population to
basic services, reduce travel time, enhance the administration of
road transportation and maintenance, and provide temporary
employment opportunities to low-income communities, the IDB said.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is 71.8 million dollars. The IDB
loan is for a 40-year term, with a 10-year grace period, at an
annual interest rate of 1 percent during the grace period and 2
percent thereafter.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Looks into Fishing Incident With Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government Wednesday
said it is looking into an incident during which Turkish troops
are said to have fired shots at Greek Cypriot fishermen.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to establish exactly what happened before we
make any further moves," government sources said, adding that the
government has received reports on the incident, which occurred on
Monday night and early Tuesday morning when the fishermen were out
at sea to cast their fishing nets.
</P>
<P>
However, U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP)
spokeswoman Sarah Russell, said Wednesday that Greek Cypriot
fishermen did cross the security maritime line on two occasions
in the past couple of days.
</P>
<P>
She also said she could not confirm reports that Turkish troops
fired shots and flares on the fishermen at this stage.
</P>
<P>
"We have a report from the Cypriot police and we saw a fishing
boat crossing the maritime security zone by about 450 meters on
Monday and again early Tuesday morning," Russell said.
</P>
<P>
The UNFICYP has complained to the Cypriot government about what
it called violations of the maritime security zone, on the east of
the Cyprus island, which is effectively an extension of the U.N.-
controlled buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus was established in 1964
and more than 1,200 peacekeepers are patroling the 180-kilometer
dividing line across the country between the rival Greek Cypriots
and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyrus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Finance Congo (K) National Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has pledged to finance the long-delayed national debate of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to be held in Kenyan capital
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President of the DRC National Debate Organizing Committee,
 Coustantim Nono, revealed this here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Moi, Nono said, they exchanged opinions
on the situation in the DRC and the arrangements for the national
debate.
</P>
<P>
The debate on the reconstruction of the war-torn central
African country has to be convened in Kenya just because security
could not be guaranteed in the DRC, Nono said.
</P>
<P>
"The date for the debate has not been set," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nono thanked the Kenyan government and people for their help,
noting that Africa has the ability to solve its own problems by
joining hands together.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international community including the United
Nations agencies are ready to finance the debate.
</P>
<P>
The national debate will involve representatives from civil
society, non-governmental organizations and cross-section of
Congoleses to discuss the national election arrangements and
reviewing of the current constitution, Nono said.
</P>
<P>
The national debate will surely be held no matter whether there
is a cease-fire or not, Nono noted.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Unveils Reassembled Statue of God, Goddess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Museum unveiled on
Wednesday a Pharaonic sculpture of a god and goddess that has been
reconstructed from 250 fragments.
</P>
<P>
The assembly is the fruit of five years of work by Egyptologist
Hourig Sourouzian of the German Institute of Archaeology in Cairo,
who was the first to realize that the pieces of limestone stored
in six different sites in Egypt belonged to a single statue,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The sculpture shows Amun - the god of air, creation and empire
- seated with his consort Mut - the goddess of motherhood and
nature. It dates from the reign of King Horemheb (1320-1306 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
As major elements of the gods' bodies are missing, the statue
has been rebuilt on a steel frame of 4.5 meters high with the
fragments held in place by thick pins and epoxy resin.
</P>
<P>
The statue originally stood in Karnak, the Pharaonic city in
Luxor, 520 kilometers south of Cairo. Mut's head, the first piece
to be excavated, was found in 1870. Other fragments were
subsequently dug up and stored or put on display in Cairo and
Karnak.
</P>
<P>
Sourouzian encountered the fragments while looking for pieces
of other group statues for her doctoral thesis. The breakthrough
came in 1994 when she discovered Amun's head in a storeroom in the
Egyptian Museum. During the next three years, she recognized more
fragments that belonged to the statue.
</P>
<P>
The work of fitting the fragments together began in September
1998.
</P>
<P>
Excavation continues in Karnak, and just last month workmen
found a sliver of Mut's cheek. It was glued on, and the statue,
consisting of 78 fragments, was finished Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Accuses Italy of Supporting PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Wednesday harshly criticized
Italy for adopting encouraging approach towards members and
sympathizers of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), said
Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Sermet Atacanli here.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli called on the Italian government to act with prudence
in order to preserve the "solid foundations" on which the essence
of Turkish-Italian relations are based.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that PKK supporters are increasingly given a free
hand to carry out violent activities in Italy is a grave
development," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the Italian authorities to act realistically and
with prudence...in order to prevent further shadows from being
cast on the friendly relations between our two countries," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Western countries, which are against the death penalty, called
on Turkey not to hang PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan after he was
sentenced to death on June 29 on charges of treason and separatism.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, two groups of PKK supporters briefly occupied a
Turkish commercial office and one room of the Italian Foreign
Trade Ministry in Rome.
</P>
<P>
The attackers walked out freely and no action was taken
against them by the Italian police.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Italy have been at odds since last November when
Ocalan arrived in Rome and was hosted there at a luxurious villa
for several months.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral tensions have mounted again recently following the
death sentence on Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli pointed out that "although the present developments
could be seen as the result of Italy's own dynamics, we cannot
tolerate statements and acts which constitute an interference into
Turkey's democratic system and judicial procedures."
</P>
<P>
Following harsh remarks by Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit on Tuesday, Turkish Ambassador in Rome Necati Utkan was
summoned to the Italian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ocalan-led PKK has been fighting a war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey since 1984. Conflicts between
the Turkish security forces and the PKK militants have claimed
over 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkish special agents in Kenya in
mid-February and has ever since been detained on Imrali Island
in Marmara Sea near western Turkey's province of Bursa.

ADDIS ABABA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The National Population Office
of Ethiopia said Wednesday that 10 percent of the Ethiopian women
are having access to family planning services compared to only
four percent some six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting here to mark the World Population Day
which falls on July 11, Negussie Tefera, head of the National
Population Office of Ethiopia, said encouraging achievements have
been made in the implementation of the national population policy
both at the federal and regional levels.
</P>
<P>
Negussie said that women, health, social and environmental
protection policies have contributed to the implementation of the
national population policy.
</P>
<P>
The national population policy, which was launched six years
ago, states that the number of children in a family should not
exceed four, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, with a population of 60 million, is the third largest
 population country in Africa only following Nigeria and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls on Turkey to Withdraw from Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Wednesday called on Turkey to withdraw its
troops from northern Iraq immediately and to respect Iraq's
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that respecting internationally recognized borders
and non-interference in other countries' internal affairs are the
basic principles for maintaining peace and stability and removing
misunderstanding between neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran rejects any action violating the territorial
integrity of any countries, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that some 10,000 Turkish troops supported
by tanks, armored vehicles, helicopters and warplanes, entered
northern Iraq on Saturday to crack down the Turkish Kurdish
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The reported fresh Turkish military incursion into Iraq came
after a Turkish court issued recently a death verdict on the
leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) Abdullah
Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman also denied the entry of PKK members and
their presence in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Such baseless news are aimed at undermining efforts to expand
ties between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sends Team to Baghdad to Close UNSCOM Lab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A team of independent
experts is scheduled to leave for Baghdad on Thursday to close a
U.N. laboratory reportedly containing dangerous chemicals, a U.N.
spokesman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The team comprises four chemical experts from the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in the Hague and an
independent biological weapons expert, spokesman Manorl de Almeida
e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
According to a list released by the U.N. spokesman's office,
the experts are led by Dirk van Niekerk, a South African chemical
production technologist.
</P>
<P>
Team members are Ms. Li Hua, analytical chemist from China,
Sergey Orlov, analytical chemicist from Russia and Miroslav
Miklasz, medical doctor from Poland.
</P>
<P>
The one not belonging to OPCW is Wolfgang Beyer, microbiologist
at Hohenheim University in Stuttgart, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The team is expected to arrive in Baghdad next week, with stops
in Bahrain and Jordan over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
It is going to be accompanied by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's special representative Prakash Shah and four senior
foreign diplomats, Almeida e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
The chemical substances, said to include 1 kilogram of mustard
gas and V-X agents were left behind by inspectors of the U.N.
Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) who were evacuated on December
16 ahead of U.S.-British air-strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Since then Baghdad has not resumed cooperation with UNSCOM, but
agreed to accept independent experts to close the lab and remove
the gases seen dangerous in case of a power failure or high
temperature.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Urged to Liberate Child Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior official with the
Pan-African Youth Movement has appealed to African leaders to do
more to save the child soldiers on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Mushokolwa Leonidas, deputy secretary-general of the
specialized agency of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in
the field of youth, said here Wednesday evening that the problem
of child soldiers demands attention from all African leaders.
</P>
<P>
Leonidas said that his organization is currently carrying out a
program aimed at sensitizing the leaders on the problem with a
view to bringing the issue to an end.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that over 100,000 child soldiers have been
employed in armed conflicts on the continent. The war experience
will damage these children both psychologically and physically,
the official warned.
</P>
<P>
The youth organization would send officials to two refugee
camps to assess the nature of the problem of child soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The child soldiers should have the normal environment in which
other children enjoy, he noted. Once the child soldiers are
liberated, they would return home and receive normal education.
</P>
<P>
The Pan-African Youth Movement was set up on April 26, 1962.
Its prime aim is to address and solve youth problems such as
unemployment, education and others.

<HEADLINE> S. African Presence in Congo (K) Subject to Long </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's possible
peace-keeping role in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) would
be subject to a long approval process, Defense Ministry spokesman
Puso Tladi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to reports that the South African National Defense
Force (SANDF) could send troops within 24 hours of a cease-fire
agreement, Tladi said any involvement depended entirely on
receiving a request for assistance from either the United Nations,
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) or the Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the type of involvement would have to be
determined, then approved in accordance with the budgets of the
requesting organization and the relevant South African ministry.
</P>
<P>
Any deployment would need cabinet approval and parliamentary
ratification.
</P>
<P>
"It has been agreed that there will be a Joint Monitoring
Commission and we have definitely agreed to participate in that,"
Tladi said. "The monitoring of the cease-fire doesn't necessarily
mean the sending of soldiers."
</P>
<P>
He said news reports Wednesday gave the impression, after an
interview with Defense Minister Patrick Lekota, that Lekota had
said South African troops could be deployed in the DRC in less
than 24 hours after a cease- fire was formally signed, ready to
face any eventuality.
</P>
<P>
"This is not so. What he said was that the monitoring of the
cease-fire could commence within 24 hours after an agreement has
been signed by all participants and role players.
</P>
<P>
"This is in terms of an understanding agreed to in principle
during discussion in Lusaka, which does not make reference to
SANDF unit deployment, and the many processes and drills that
precede such a deployment."
</P>
<P>
Tladi said last year's Lesotho operation was different to the
situation in the DRC. "It was a coup and a big disruption that
came suddenly (in Lesotho). The DRC is a long drawn-out problem."
</P>
<P>
South African and Botswana troops entered Lesotho last
September under the auspices of the SADC to restore order in the
mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, a draft cease-fire document for the DRC
was finally adopted Wednesday by foreign and defense ministers of
the countries involved in the conflict and rebel representatives.

ANKARA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Armed Forces Wednesday
received 10 Black Hawk helicopters purchased from the Sikorsky
Company of the United States, the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the delivery ceremony, Huseyin Kivrikoglu, Chief

Turkish army, which aims to be one of the world's most powerful
armed forces, will protect the democratic and secular Turkey
against all threats.

He said that modern armies have equipped themselves with
military equipment designed with the latest technology. And in
this respect, the Turkish Armed Forces have ordered 50 Black Hawk
helicopters under a modernization program.
</P>
<P>
"Our country is located in a geographical spot where peace and
stability have been endangered throughout the history, where a
clash of interests continues to endure," said Kivrikoglu, adding
that in order to play a powerful role in the region, Turkey must
have powerful armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his army should also support NATO's role in
preventing world crises and maintaining peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador Mark Parris said that "one of the
reasons why we supported the sale of American defense equipment
to Turkey is that this equipment will enable a joint operation

<HEADLINE> Portugal Agrees to Reschedule Mozambique's Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Finance Minister Antonio
Sousa Franco said Wednesday that his government has agreed to give
a grace for 90 percent of the 470-million-U.S.-dollar debt owed to
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Franco made the announcement at a joint press conference here
after his talks with Mozambican Planning and Finance Minister
Tomaz Salomao in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese minister did not disclose any details about the
debt rescheduling, but pledged that his government is willing to
contribute to Mozambique's debt relief.
</P>
<P>
Portugal will do more in multi-lateral negotiations within the
Paris Club for more debt write-off, he added.
</P>
<P>
Franco noted that the Mozambican government has made great
efforts to achieve economic growth, keep marco-economic balance
and strengthen democracy.
</P>
<P>
The international financial institutions including the World
Bank have written off some 3.7 billion dollars of Mozambique's
debts.
</P>
<P>
Salomao said that during their three-day meeting, the two
governments also reached agreement in such fields as human
resources development, customs and insurance.
</P>
<P>
But the Mozambican minister denied that some Portuguese
departments will take the place of the British Crown Agents in
managing the Mozambican customs.
</P>
<P>
Franco, who arrived in Maputo Sunday for a three-day visit to
the southern African country, also held meeting with Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano. He will leave Maputo for home later
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean President Urges National Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- President Tejan Kabbah Wednesday
called on his fellow Sierra Leoneans to learn to "forgive and
forget" in rehabilitating the war-torn west African country, a
report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before signing the peace accord with the rebels in
Togolese capital Lome, the president introduced a mutilated woman
and a child to the audience, saying that they are the victims of
the war waged by the rebel Revolutionary United Front's forces.
</P>
<P>
Despite the atrocities made by the rebels, the Sierra Leonean
people should learn to "forgive and forget" and pool their efforts
in achieving a true national reconciliation, said Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The signing process began following Kabbah's speech.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Kabbah and rebel leader Foday Sankoh, presidents
of Nigeria, Liberia, Burkina Faso and Togo as well as
representatives of the U. N. and other international organizations
started signing their names on many places of the stacked
documents.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who led the rebels in fighting successive governments
since 1991 latter addressed the ceremony, and Togo's Foreign
minister Kokou Koffigoh, also a general coordinator of the
seven-week peace talks, would release a communique.
</P>
<P>
The accord, agreed to only on Wednesday morning, stipulates
that the rebels will be disarmed and share power with the elected
Kabbah administration by acquiring several ministerial posts in a
transitional government.
</P>
<P>
But the Nigeria-led west Africa peace-keeping force ECOMOG will
stay in Sierra Leone, according to the document, which was
formerly opposed by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Presidents from Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Liberia and the host
country Togo were present at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The mini-summit, called by Togolese President Gnassingbe
Eyadema, current Chairman of the Economic Community of the West
Africa States (ECOWAS), played an important role in removing the
final hurdles on the road to the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
All parties concerned, including Nigeria which has been leading
the ECOMOG in fighting the Sierra Leonean rebels and Liberia and
Burkina Faso which had been allegedly backing the rebels secretly,
were brought together to made a final push for a lasting peace in
the war-torn west African country.

<HEADLINE> OAU to Be More Efficient, Transparent: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU), which has been under fire for low efficiency, is trying to
trim itself into a "more efficient body to meet the new
millennium", an OAU official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Dagash, spokesman of the biggest organization in
Africa, said at a press conference here during the two-day OAU
ambassadors' meeting that the OAU will be transformed into a
"human, fair and transparent organization" after the restructuring
program.
</P>
<P>
The 18-month-long streamlining program, which will cut the
organization of about 600 member by 200, is expected to complete
by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
A thinner OAU administration, he said, will help the
organization meet the challenges in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
OAU is to hold the 35th annual summit in Algiers, Algeria, from
July 12 to 14, at a time when the continent is facing "daunting
challenges in the socio-economic and political fields, and in
context of a rapidly changing world."
</P>
<P>
The African people are facing severe hardships like poverty,
illiteracy, diseases, unemployment, rising crimes, and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming summit, the last before the advent of the next
millennium, is widely regarded as a chance for the African leaders
to get better prepared for new challenges ahead.

<HEADLINE> UK to Fight Racist Organ Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- British Health Secretary Frank
Dobson vowed Wednesday to keep racism out of the health service
after reports that human organs had been donated on condition they
were given to white patients.
</P>
<P>
The reports cast a new cloud over race relations in Britain,
already strained after the police force was found to be racist
following its bungled investigation into the 1993 murder of black
youth Stephen Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
"I have not been the opponent of the apartheid movement for the
whole of my adult life to see it introduced in the National Health
Service," Dobson said while touring a hospital outside London with
Prime Minister Tony Blair, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Dobson later told ITN television news he would introduce rules
preventing donors from choosing the race of the person to receive
their organs if rules were deemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
"It had never occurred to me that a rule would be necessary to
keep racism out of blood transfusion and transplants," Dobson
said. "If it is necessary to introduce a rule, we'll introduce
it."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Dobson ordered an inquiry into a case revealed by
BBC television in which a donor's family told the Northern General
Hospital in the city of Sheffield last July that the recipient of
their relative's kidneys must be white.
</P>
<P>
Black Labor MP Bernie Grant, himself awaiting a kidney
transplant, condemned race-selective organ donations and called on
Dobson to get to the bottom of the case.
</P>
<P>
"It's an outrage of enormous proportions," Grant was quoted by
Reuters as saying. "It challenges the whole basis of the NHS as a
universal service in which black and white life is of equal
value."
</P>
<P>
"We were promised things would change and there wouldn't be the
official reluctance to stamp out racism there has been in the
past," Grant said. "It's up to Frank Dobson to take some urgent
disciplinary action and find who was behind this."
</P>
<P>
Race relations campaigners expressed outrage at the kidney
transplant report, with Assembly Against Racism spokesman Kumar
Mushid calling it "incomprehensible" for people engaging in an act
of humanity by allowing the use of an organ to be imposing racist
conditions on its use.

<HEADLINE> UK Post Offices Issue Passport Extensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- All main post offices in the UK
began issuing free passport extensions on Wednesday in a bid to
ease the current backlog crisis, which has resulted in thousands
of people cancelling their holidays or business trips.
</P>
<P>
Extensions of up to two years are being given for full
passports that are either about to expire or have expired in the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
Those caught in the current backlog of applications can go to
any of 1,500 main post offices across the country. Applicants will
only need proof of identity such as their old passport or a
driving licence.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, there are some 530,000 outstanding applications,
even though new queuing arrangements and a national phone centre
have been set up.
</P>
<P>
The delays have been reportedly caused by a combination of new
computer technology introduced last October at the same time as
new rules requiring children and babies to have their own
passports.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw has admitted that the service
will not be back to normal before September. Even that deadline
would depend on a predicted big drop in passport applications
happening "at some stage next month".
</P>
<P>
An extra 100 staff are being recruited to help tackle the
backlog, in addition to 300 workers already hired, and staff are
still working into the night and at weekends to try to cut delays,
according to earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
Straw insisted there was "no suggestion whatsoever" that the
crisis was the fault of the passport staff, who were working
"round the clock". But queues of anxious holiday-makers have
embarrassed ministers.

MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma and the NATO
Parliamentary Assembly plan to resume cooperation shortly, the
Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by Duma chairman Gennady Seleznyov
and Javier Ruperes, head of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly,
following their talks in St. Petersburg, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The activities of the Coordinating Interparliamentary Committee
were suspended when NATO started its 78-day air strikes on
Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
An understanding has been reached that representatives of the
Russian lower house of parliament will meet with Ruperes in
October "to discuss further cooperation," Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
"Even when the situation is most dramatic for their countries,
parliamentarians must meet and look for solutions," Seleznyov
said.
</P>
<P>
Ruperes, for his part, welcomed the start of improvement in
relations between the NATO and Russian parliaments.
</P>
<P>
While the two sides analyze the developments in Kosovo in
different lights, they think alike about the joint rebuilding of
the region, Ruperes said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Blasts Britain Over Gold Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Wednesday accused
Britain of breaking a promise not to go ahead with gold sales
without prior consultation and retracted its initial conditional
support for the intended gold sales by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
"The South African government finds both incomprehensible and
unacceptable the insensitivity of the British government and its
monetary authorities to the pleas of gold-producing countries,"
government spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe told a news briefing in
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"This behavior, and the decisions of other industrialized
countries and the IMF on the public handling of gold sales, is
having the effect of defeating the very objectives that they
profess to pursue," the spokesman read from a cabinet statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the South African government would continue
discussions with the countries and organizations concerned to
ensure that their aim of relieving the debt burden of developing
countries did not "degenerate into a beggaring of the economies of
the intended beneficiaries. "
</P>
<P>
South African Minerals and Energy Minister Phumzile
Mlambo-Ngcuka said that his country had formally reversed its
position regarding the sale of gold by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Asked why, she said: "The amount being sold is what makes the
difference. Taking into consideration all the events and the
situation now, we realized that we need to revisit that position."
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's British auction of 25 tons of gold saw the metal's
price sliding to a fresh 20-year low of 256.10 U.S. dollars per
ounce.
</P>
<P>
Ngcuka said President Thabo Mbeki has been in discussions with
some of the "major countries" and their central banks,
particularly Britain, Germany, France, Japan, and the United
States, regarding their intention to sell some of their bullion.
</P>
<P>
"In relation to the UK, there was an agreement that... before
they went out to embark on any sales they would revert back to us,
which in this case did not happen. What has now happened is quite
unacceptable and of concern to us."
</P>
<P>
The other countries undertook not to go ahead with such sales.
</P>
<P>
The minister said South Africa intended sending a
representative to Britain to ask for help from "some of our
partners" to ensure that the current trend in that country did not
continue.
</P>
<P>
The South African government would also maintain pressure on
the other countries not to follow Britain's suit.
</P>
<P>
It would furthermore seek a common position on this matter with
other indebted gold-producing countries," Ngcuka said.
</P>
<P>
This would be done by consultations with the embassies of such
countries, and visits by Ngcuka's deputy to some key gold
producers such as Mali, Ghana and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel was on his way to
a meeting with his counterparts in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), where this issue would also be on
the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Ngcuka called on employers not to react to the current gold
crisis by retrenching workers.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the biggest gold producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
"There is evidence that there is more demand than supply,"
Ngcuka said. "Gold is likely to recover and we don't think we are
seeing the end of this industry."
</P>
<P>
On the pending liquidation of East Rand Proprietary Mines,
Ngcuka said, this could not be solely blamed on the current
situation in the gold market.
</P>
<P>
The mine, she said, had been in trouble for the past 10 years,
and its management should have foreseen the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
She said the mine has not reached the end of its life, and in
order to give it another chance the government would assist in
efforts to find a new investor.

<HEADLINE> Tomahawk Cruise Missile Triggers Argument in U.S. House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. lawmakers, ignoring the
Navy's wishes, are pushing to reopen a closed assembly line of
Tomahawk cruise missiles in a move that would benefit a company in
one of the lawmakers' districts, U.S. House sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two members of the House Armed Services Committee,
Republican legislators James Hansen from Utah State and Duncan
Hunter from California State, said they simply want the Navy to
keep a larger reserve of the sea-launched Block III Tomahawk
missiles, which won accolades in the Persian Gulf and Yugoslavia
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
They said their efforts have nothing to do with the fact that
engines for the soon-to-be-obsolete missile are made in Hansen's
Utah district.
</P>
<P>
The Navy, however, began phasing out the Block III missiles
last year in favor of a new generation of Tactical Tomahawks due
out in 2003. The service believes it has enough Block III missiles
to wait until then and believes reopening the line wouldn't be
cost-effective, said Navy spokeswoman Megan Mariman.
</P>
<P>
The new missiles will cost 569,000 U.S. dollars each, compared
with 1.5 million U.S. dollars for the Block III.
</P>
<P>
The price tag for the Block III Tomahawks would be 90 million
U.S. dollars. That's how much the House Armed Services Committee
authorized in May to reopen the production line. The House
Appropriations Committee must decide whether to recommend the
measure to the full House.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy last year ended production of the missile, which
was used in the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in a
successful effort to avoid U.S. and allied casualties.

WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The largest fire burning in the
West of the United States, a 25,000-hectare blaze feeding on
pinyon pine, juniper and cheat grass in central Utah State, is
expected to be declared controlled by late Wednesday, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The fire twice drove residents of the Eureka and Mammoth areas
in Utah from their homes over the weekend, but no one was injured
and only three abandoned shacks burned.

Over 420 firefighters have been working on the fire and they
were expected to be released beginning Wednesday, the reports

Elsewhere, a 3,600-hectare fire near Genola, 95 kilometers
south of Salt Lake City, was 90 percent contained and control was
projected for late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Near Hesperia, California State, a blaze in the San Bernardino
National Forest forced about 70 people to evacuate their homes but
they were allowed to return late Tuesday. The fire was 80 percent
contained Wednesday after burning through 1,100 hectares of brush,

<HEADLINE> Situation in C. Angola Returns to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The situation around the central
highland city of Huambo has returned to normal thanks to a series
of operations by the Angolan government, Governor of Huambo
Province Paulo Kassoma said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The governor noted that the armed forces, national police and
militia should keep alert on possible fresh attacks by the rebel
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The conflicts between the government army and the UNITA troops
had picked up since mid-June.
</P>
<P>
Kassoma spoke highly of the government's re-taking of the
strategic Mount Mbazi, some 40 kms north of Huambo city last
Thursday. The UNITA troops had launched attacks against the
provincial capital from the mount, threatening Huambo's airport,
the only life line of the city.
</P>
<P>
On June 19, some 1,000 UNITA troops launched sudden attacks
against the town of Caala, some 23 kms west of Huambo, resuming
long-range artillery bombardment of the city. The escalating
tension has created a new wave of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Food supply is far from enough in the area. It was reported
that malnutrition was spreading there like anything. Everyday the
nutrition center in Caala has to receive more than 200 patients
while it is capable of taking only 150.

<HEADLINE> Blair Cancels Poland Trip for N.Ireland Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has canceled a visit to Poland in order to concentrate on the
continuing crisis in the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
The move came as the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) warned that it
probably could not accept the latest peace proposals without
further assurances from the government. The party's ruling
executive is due to meet Friday when it could make a decision on
whether or not to sign up to the plan.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have also been raised by the Orange Order's decision
to move its traditional 12 July rally in Belfast to the south of
the city in protest against the banning of the local lodge's
parade through a mainly nationalist area.
</P>
<P>
Blair was to have flown to Warsaw Sunday and to have returned
home Monday or Tuesday. But his spokesman said the prime minister
had regretfully decided that he could not go.
</P>
<P>
UUP leader and Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble
warned that the government was making it increasingly more
difficult for his party to make up its mind.
</P>
<P>
The unionist leader said uncertainty was deepening and every
time he sought clarification of the latest UK-Irish proposals he
was left with more questions than answers, according to a BBC
report.
</P>
<P>
Under the plans advanced last week, the unionists accepted Sinn
Fein into a governmental executive next week and a weapons
decommissioning process would start within days.
</P>
<P>
If the Irish Republican Army did not begin disarm its weapons
soon after, then Sinn Fein would face exclusion from the executive
under legislation to be rushed through the British and Irish
parliaments, Blair told the Parliament Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Trimble, his party's great worry was that "we make
the sacrifice in terms of being prepared to enter into the
administration with unreconstructed terrorists, but then they
refuse to decommission, but the automatic failsafe isn't automatic
and that we come under pressure by people saying it's Sinn Fein
and they are not the same as the IRA and they are trying and let's
not throw this all out."
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he did not think the party could make a decision
on the peace plan until it had more details from government.
However, he made it clear he would not give up on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein appears to be largely supportive of the peace deal,
but it has demanded assurances that the government would not halt
the early release of paramilitary prisoners if the IRA failed to
disarm.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street insists that it has the power to take such
action under the Northern Ireland Sentences Act.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Visits Indian Reservation in South Dekota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
visited the poverty-stricken Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in
South Dekota Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Indians at the reservation's high school,
Clinton said the United States can no longer afford to ignore
poverty and unemployment among them.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the first president to visit an Indian reservation
in 60 years since Franklin D. Roosevelt visited a Cherokee
reservation in North Carolina on September 9, 1936.
</P>
<P>
He said its time for a more respectful, empowering relationship
with tribal governments.
</P>
<P>
"We know well the imperfect relationship that the United States
and its government has enjoyed with the tribal nations," Clinton
said. "You have suffered from neglect and you know that doesn't
work."
</P>
<P>
The national unemployment rate in the United States is below 5
percent, the lowest in three decades, but it's about 75 percent on
the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, the poorest region of America.
</P>
<P>
"We have to find a way not only to fix the very difficult
housing circumstances, but to get them jobs," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced that the Department of Agriculture would
implement 16 million dollars in water projects throughout Indian
lands, with two of those projects in Pine Ridge.
</P>
<P>
Pine Ridge, site of the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre in which 300
Indians were slain, will receive more than 1.5 billion in private
investment programs and government assistance to boost housing and
economic development on Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
The visit to Pine Ridge was one of Clinton's tour to poor areas
from Appalachia to inner-city Los Angeles to encourage investment
in communities that haven't shared in the nation's good economic
times.
</P>
<P>
According to the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Indian
Affairs, 1.43 million Indians live on or near reservations.
Roughly 33 percent of them are children younger than 15, and 38
percent of Indian children aged 6 to 11 live in poverty, compared
with 18 percent for U.S. children nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Only 63 percent of Indians are high school graduates.
Twenty-nine percent are homeless, and 59 percent live in
substandard housing. Twenty percent of Indian households on
reservations do not have full access to plumbing, and the majority
-- 53.4 percent -- do not have telephones.
</P>
<P>
The per capita income of Indians living on reservations is far
below that of other Americans.

LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Europe's main markets all closed
firmly in the red Wednesday as a weak start on Wall Street and
profit-taking continued to hit the markets.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index ended the session down 0.35 percent at
6,597.4, a fall of 23.2 points from Tuesday's record close.

UK investors were cautious as the two-day Bank of England's

Surprisingly strong UK economic data released Tuesday reduced
the chances of a further rate cut, but the continued weakness in
sterling against the dollar could influence the committee's

On the same day, the electronically-traded Xetra Dax in
Frankfurt ended down 0.43 percent, or 24.4 points, at 5,588.50.

Dealers said profit-taking continued with computer software
company SAP and Mannesmann making heavy losses after Wall Street's
negative opening put further pressure on closing market prices.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Cognitive Decline Not Normal in Aging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Cognitive decline is not a
normal part of aging for the majority of elderly people, according
to a study conducted by researchers at University of California.
</P>
<P>
In fact, only people with high levels of atherosclerosis or
diabetes and also those with the apolipoprotein E4 (Apo4E) gene
associated with Alzheimer's disease are both at risk for a decline
in cognitive ability as they age.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted at the UC Davis School of Medicine,
tracked changes in cardiovascular health and cognitive function in
almost 6,000 senior citizens annually over a 10-year period. The
results of the study were reported in the July 7 issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of individuals evaluated in the study showed no
significant decline in cognitive function over the study period,
the medical school said in a release Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the researchers found that the greatest loss of
cognitive ability occurred in people who had both high levels of
atherosclerosis or diabetes and an Apo4E gene. These individuals
were eight times more likely to show a decline in function
compared to people with a low level of atherosclerosis and no
genetic predisposition. Individuals with an E4 allele were
three-to-four times more likely to show a decline in function than
those without this genotype. And those with high levels of
atherosclerosis were three times more likely to show a loss of
function than those without atherosclerosis.
</P>
<P>
Cognitive function is defined as the intellectual process by
which one becomes aware of, perceives, or comprehends ideas. It
involves all aspects of perception, thinking, reasoning and
remembering.
</P>
<P>
The school said that other studies of the elderly have shown
that people with the ApoE4 gene have a higher risk of Alzheimer's
disease. But it was not clear what role atherosclerosis or
diabetes might play. Now the current study shows that the risk of
cognitive impairment or even dementia in those who have a genetic
predisposition may be reduced by preventing atherosclerosis. And
doctors know a lot about preventing cardiovascular disease and not
much about preventing cognitive impairment or dementia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tobacco Industry Found Liable in Class-action Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A Florida jury found Wednesday
U.S. cigarette makers produced a defective product that causes
emphysema, lung cancer and other illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The six-person jury in the first class-action lawsuit by
smokers ever to go to trial ruled that America's biggest tobacco
companies must pay unspecified damages for conspiring to hide the
dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
Their decision could prove to be the industry's most dire
courtroom loss yet, since the plaintiffs are seeking at least 200
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed in 1994 on behalf of as many as 500,000
sick or dead Florida smokers and their survivors. The plaintiffs'
attorney had said potential damages -- to be assessed in a later
series of trials -- could range from 200 billion dollars to 500
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The defendants were the nation's five biggest cigarette makers
and two industry groups: Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co.,
Liggett Group Inc., the Council for Tobacco Research and the
Tobacco Institute.
</P>
<P>
The smokers claimed the industry deceived them about the dangers
of smoking, hid research results, stopped scientific work that
promised to produce safer cigarettes and advertised to children.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Stanley Rosenblatt called it a "rampant and cynical
long-standing pattern of fraud."

WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of a loan of 77
million U.S. dollars to Uruguay to improve the quality of life in
irregular settlements and to support a policy review to improve
housing for low-income communities.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to benefit approximately 100 irregular
settlements with nearly 10,000 families, which constitute about 30
percent of the total population living in these kinds of
disadvantaged communities throughout the country, the
Washington-based bank said.
</P>
<P>
Direct investments will be made in infrastructure, community
facilities and social services, and families will be given
assistance for regularizing the legal status of their properties.
</P>
<P>
Funds will be available for community development activities,
monitoring and supervision of works, and preinvestment studies and
project preparation.
</P>
<P>
A review of central government and municipal urban development
policies will be undertaken with the goal of improving the
regulatory, financial and institutional framework of the housing
sector, especially with regard to bettering conditions for
low-income groups.
</P>
<P>
A coordinating unit of the Office of Planning and Budget will
be established to carry out the program, whose total cost is 110
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IDB loan is for a 25-year term, with a five-year grace
period, at the variable annual interest rate, now 6.98 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States has an
overwhelming lead in Internet users, but not so in Internet users
per capita, said the Computer Industry Almanac Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 percent of the total 150 million Internet users
worldwide were in the United States at the year-end 1998. But the
country was only ranked fifth in Internet users per capita.
</P>
<P>
The Nordic countries -- Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden --
were the leaders with 29 percent to 32 percent of the population
being regular Internet users. They were followed by the United
States, 28 percent; Australia, 23 percent; Canada, 21 percent; and
New Zealand, 19 percent. Hong Kong was ranked 14th, with 9.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Computer Industry Almanac projects that the U.S. will have
over 133 million Internet users or nearly 42 percent of the total
318 million worldwide Internet users in year 2000. The country
will grow to 485 Internet users per 1,000 people in 2000 and will
be in a race for the top ranking in per capita usage. These
numbers include adult Internet users with weekly usage in
businesses and homes.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, there will be about 320 million Internet users or
52.5 per 1,000 people at year-end 2000, and about 720 million
users or 110 per 1,000 people by year-end 2005. The U.S. will grow

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 4.12 Billion Dollars in Loan to Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua)-- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on Wednesday approved a loan of 4.12 billion U.S. dollars
for Mexico that is part of a larger package of credits designed to
help the country avert economic turmoil during next year's
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
An IMF spokesman said the loan will be disbursed in seven
installments over a 17-month period, provided Mexico sticks to
terms of an economic program agreed with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials said last month they had obtained 23.7
billion dollars in international credits and refinancing to
protect the country when it holds presidential elections in July
2000.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the country's economy has often suffered during
the presidential transition period -- a tendency blamed on the
collapse of short-term strategies to prop up the economy during
the campaign and investor wariness about a new government.
</P>
<P>
The package includes 6.8 billion dollars in credits from the
United States and Canada, Mexico's partners in the North American
Free Trade Area, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the World Bank is expected to provide 5.2 billion
dollars and the Inter-American Development Bank 3.5 billion
dollars. Mexico will also receive 4 billion dollars from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The third women's World Cup
final will be played between China and host team the United States
at Rose Bowl on Saturday and the American players and team officials
showed deep respect for the Chinese team.
</P>
<P>
Forward Tiffeny Milbrett, who had scored three goals in the
tournament, said:"The Chinese team have technical speed that is
unbelievable. Their vision of the field is amazing."
</P>
<P>
Kate Sobrero said:"Every single player on that team is strong, fast
and technical."
</P>
<P>
"They send numbers forward and they love to attack," said
American assistant coach Lauren Gregg, the team's resident
tactician, "They find the most dangerous, penetrative options as
quickly as possible."
</P>
<P>
The American head coach Tony DiCicco said:"They don't make a lot
of mistakes."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team play to win, unlike several other teams in the
tournament that sit back on defense and pray for a tie when taking
on the Americans. China have been winners of two out of three
encounters against the American team.
</P>
<P>
The American players, especially the forwards, know that their
Chinese rivals won't take any cheap shots.
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be some exciting, excellent soccer for
everyone to enjoy," said Milbrett, "It's going to be a challenge for
us and it'll be exciting to try and create against one of the
world's best defenses."
</P>
<P>
Gregg said she believes China's striker Sun Wen, not Mia Hamm,is
the best finisher in the world right now and the final will be a
game for the ages.
</P>
<P>
"The final on Saturday will be one of the finest soccer matches
ever played," said Gregg.

<HEADLINE> Italian Police Finds Bomb in Turkish Mosque </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Italian Police announced Wednesday
that a one kilo bomb, complete with three detonators has been
found in one of the two Turkish mosques on the outskirts of
Italian north city of Como Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said that an anonymous caller phoned the
religious center Tuesday night and warned that the place was about
to be blown up.
</P>
<P>
The caller, who spoke in Turkish, said that he belonged to a
"Turkish anti-fascist movement".
</P>
<P>
Police evacuated homes near the mosque and closed the area to
traffic while they defused the explosive device, safely completing
the operation shortly after Tuesday midnight.
</P>
<P>
There was no timer attached to the bomb, which had been hidden
in a heater situated in an outside courtyard, and it was unclear
if it could really have gone off.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish community is the largest foreign group living in
Como, and is held to be on good terms with local Kurds.
</P>
<P>
But the city has recently seen a spate of anti-Turkish protests
and wall scribbling attributed to hard left-wing Turkish groups.
</P>
<P>
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan were suspected of being
behind the latest incident.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. CEO Confidence Increases in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Chief executives' confidence
in the nation's economy increased by 10 points in the second
quarter, the Conference Board, a U.S. prominent research group,
said Wednesday in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Measure of Business Confidence in the
second quarter jumped to 56 from the previous quarter's reading of
46. A reading of more than 50 points reflects more positive than
negative responses.
</P>
<P>
"The continued strength of the U.S. economy is no doubt partly
responsible for the strong current assessment of economic
conditions on the part of chief executives," said Lynn Franco,
associate director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
The report said, CEO's assessment of current economic
conditions improved substantially from the first quarter survey.
About 41 percent of the CEO's feel economic conditions have gotten
better over the past six months, up from 25 percent and those who
feel conditions have deteriorated over the past six months
declined to 7 percent from about 19 percent in the first quarter,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders' confidence regarding conditions in their own
industries was significantly more upbeat, the report said, adding
that close to 53 percent of CEOs fell conditions are better than
six months ago, up from about 24 percent last quarter.
</P>
<P>
The report said regarding profit expectations during the next
12 months, more than three out of every four executives anticipate
increases, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said among chief executive officers expecting
profits to increase, 46 percent cite cost reductions as the main
source of improvement and 41 percent cite new technology as the
most likely source. Only 9 percent foresee an increase in
market/demand growth as the main source of improvement, it added.

<HEADLINE> Lamb Tariff by U.S. Unacceptable: New Zealand PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley said here Thursday that the United States decision to
impose lamb import tariffs is "totally unacceptable and will lead
to World Trade Organization action."
</P>
<P>
"New Zealanders are angry and deeply disappointed at a decision
that will, in effect, be a tax on our lamb exporters. The U.S.
decision will for the next three years limit our exports and
prevent our non-subsidized industry from further developing the
U.S. lamb market," the prime minister said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand cannot and will not let the matter rest," Shipley
said.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand prime minister made the remarks in response to
U.S. President Bill Clinton's Thursday endorsement of an
across-the-board tariff on all imports of lamb from New Zealand
and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. trade restrictions, the U.S. will impose
in-quota tariff of nine percent on imports up to 31,851,151
kilograms, equivalent to the 1998 level of exports from New
Zealand and Australia, in the first year of the remedy. The
in-quota tariff will be reduced to six percent in the second year
and three percent in the third year. At the same time, the U.S.
will impose out-of-quota tariff of 40 percent in the first year,
reducing to 32 percent in the second year and 24 percent in the
third year.

<HEADLINE> Development of New Zealand's Wind Resource Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- "You have the best wind resource
in the world but you are refusing to develop it," an international
wind power expert was quoted Thursday by the Dominion as saying at
a Wellington seminar on wind power this week.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wellington-based newspaper, Dr. Andrew Garrad,
who is recognized as one of the world's leading wind energy
experts and is now working for British-based company Garrad
Hassan, the biggest wind energy consultancy in Europe, told the
seminar, "Your resource is phenomenal in global terms. You could
easily run the whole electricity system off the wind."
</P>
<P>
In theory, Garrad said, New Zealand has enough wind to provide
the country's all electricity needs.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, there was a wind farm proposed for Baring
Head at the entrance to Wellington harbor but the project was
dropped because the local people were concerned a wind farm would
be as noisy as a helicopter and would sabotage the beautiful
natural scenery.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Garrad suggested wind farms be built around New Zealand in
places where the existing power system is weak.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand power companies can also combine hydro power
stations with wind farms in a way that almost no one else in the
world can," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Use hydro as storage and the wind when it is available," he
said. "That would significantly enhance the value of the wind."
</P>
<P>
At present New Zealand has an annual generation capacity of
about 8,000 megawatts and 75 percent of its total electricity is
produced by hydro generation.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Denounces U.S. Decision on Lamb Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister for
International Trade Lockwood Smith here Thursday denounced the
United States decision to impose restrictions on imports of New
Zealand lamb.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the New Zealand minister said: "It's bitterly
disappointing that the U.S. has chosen this approach."
</P>
<P>
"In applying these trade restrictions," he said, "the U.S. has
turned its back on a very constructive proposal from Meat New
Zealand and its Australian counterpart, and allowed its long
standing reputation as a supporter of free and open trade to be
sullied by giving in to short-sighted protectionist sentiment."
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's trade with the U.S. is fair, Smith said, adding
the U.S. unwise decision sends unfortunate signals, particularly
in the year when the U.S. will host the World Trade Organization
(WTO) ministerial meeting which is expected to launch the next
round of trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand will not take today's (U.S.) decision lying
down... We will respond according to New Zealand's best
interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that U.S. President Bill Clinton Thursday
announced that he has approved an across-the-board tariff on all
imports of lamb from New Zealand and Australia in response to the
U.S. sheep meat industry's application for "safeguard action".
</P>
<P>
According to New Zealand Minister Smith, the U.S. decision will
 impose costs of approximately 24 million NZ dollars (13 million
U.S. dollars) on New Zealand's lamb industry over the next three
years. It will also limit New Zealand's legitimate trade
expectations by choking off future prospects of growth with the
heavy out-of-quota tariff.

<HEADLINE> Australia Opens Gold Account in Universiade Swimming Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Australia eventually opened
its gold account by taking two out of the six at stake from the
pool as the swimming competitions entered the fourth day at the
20th World University Games Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
After Adam Pine clocked the fastest time of 53.81 seconds to
take his first-ever gold medal in the men's 100-meter butterfly,
the Australian quartet triumphed again when pace-leader Russia was
disqualified in the 4x100 meters freestyle relay in the open-air
Son Hugo pool.
</P>
<P>
The Australians timed 3:23.05, beating Italy to second in 3:23.
60 and the United States third in 3:24.16.
</P>
<P>
However, the Americans still added two more to its swimming
gold tally to 11, nearly half of the 24 titles taken away as the
swimming competitions concluded its fourth-day events.
</P>
<P>
Mark Warkentin touched home first in the men's 400-meter
freestyle event by a considerable margin, clocking in 3:53.41,
while compatriots Amy Balcebzak and Amanda Beard finished one-two
in the women's 100-meter breaststroke in 1:09.54 and 1:10.23
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The other two swimming golds of the day were split by Spaniard
Maria Pelaez and Romanian I. Diaconescu.
</P>
<P>
Pelaez awarded the hosts its first gold medal at the
Universiade when she edged over Chinese Pang Ran to claim the 200-
meter butterfly in 2:12.34.
</P>
<P>
China is still seeking its first swimming gold medal as only
second-string athletes were dispatched for the games.
</P>
<P>
However, Pang, the former national champion, already improved
her personal best by nearly three seconds for China's first
swimming medal in the Games, a silver, in 2:12.51.
</P>
<P>
Romania also choked up its first swimming gold medal through
Diaconescu who clocked the best in the first event of the day in
56.65 seconds for the women's 100-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Of the 24 swimming gold medals in the first four days, the
United States nearly halved the tally by taking the lion's share
of 11, followed by Japan and Russia, who failed to add a single
one on Wednesday after its victory in the 4x100 meters freestyle
was disqualified, with three each.
</P>
<P>
Both Australia and the Czech Republic bagged two apiece, while
South Africa, Spain and Romania also joined the rank of champions
with one apiece.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Italian automaker Fiat and the
Japanese vehicle company Mitsubishi Wednesday struck a deal for
jointly producing a new four-wheel-drive sports utility car in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Fiat, which will invest 250 billion lire (about 135 million U.S.
dollars) in the project, will be responsible for the car's design
and styling, while Mitsubishi, with its expertise in four-wheel-
drive vehicles, will produce the chassis and engine.
</P>
<P>
Production is scheduled to begin in 2001 at the Pininfarina
plant near Turin. The two groups plan to build 30,000 cars each
year, taking roughly 10 percent of the European market in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
The car will allow Fiat to complete its range of vehicles and
at the same time renew Mitsubishi's range of four-wheel-drive
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The initial accord for the sports utility car is expected to
lead to further collaboration between the Italian and Japanese
groups.

"Fiat Auto and Mitsubishi Motors have agreed to continue
negotiations in coming weeks for further collaboration on a
technical level," a Fiat statement said.

"Of course, the fact that the Universiade is organized in Spain
means that the European countries could send larger teams," said
Campana. "But last Universiade in 1997 was also organized in
Europe, in Sicily."

<P>
"As far as the Palma Universiade is concerned, FISU is also

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Declares State of Emergency to Fight Dengue Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican Health Ministry
declared on Wednesday a state of emergency in Puerto Limon, on the
Caribbean coast, in a fight against a new outbreak of Dengue fever
affecting the region.
</P>
<P>
Six cases of hemorrhage dengue were registered in the region
last month, and 48 cases of the classic dengue over the last four
days, which alarmed the authorities, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Dengue is an endemic in the country. It is not a killer in its
classic form. However, the second contraction of the disease may
cause dengue hemorrhage, which is more dangerous to people's life.
</P>
<P>
To combat the outbreak of the disease, the ministry has taken
some preventative measures, such as the elimination of the
mosquito hatcheries, which are found in stagnant fresh water, by
fumigation campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Good Results on Current Account in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The deficit of the Latin
American current account will drop this year in comparison with
1998, which is "good news" for the region, says the monthly
periodical "Latinwatch".
</P>
<P>
The publication, edited by Banco Bilbao Viscaya (BBV), a
financial society from Spain with widespread presence in the
region, said that the deficit may stay at 3.6 percent of the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), compared with 4.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Latinwatch foresees the growth of exports next year, "if the
internal demand" is reactive.
</P>
<P>
On the theme of exports, the analysts predict that there may be
a rise towards the end of the year, depending on the economic
recuperation of each country.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the commercial balance of Latin America
has performed well over the last few months, but still has to face
some challenges.
</P>
<P>
The financial institution estimates that it will be necessary
to recuperate exports over next year, to avoid problems caused by
the restrictions on the balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
As a stimulant to this process, the BBV said that it would be
desirable to rise the international prices of raw materials, of
which only petroleum has registered an increase.
</P>
<P>
It also recommends the application of macro and micro-economics,
which assure an adequate exchange rate on the long term, in
addition to well planned strategies for the promotion of exports
from the Latin American countries.

<HEADLINE> Ericsson CEO Resigns Amid Board Dissatisfaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Sven-Chister Nilsson, chief
executive officer and president of Sweden's telecom equipment
maker L.M. Ericsson, resigned Wednesday amid board dissatisfaction
with his performance.
</P>
<P>
His job was split between two other Ericsson veterans. Lars
Ramqvist, chairman of the board, was named CEO and Kurt Hellstroem,
executive vice president-Asia Pacific, was appointed president.
</P>
<P>
Ramqvist told a press conference here that the board move was
prompted by dissatisfaction at Nilsson's slow implementation of
last year's decision to streamline the group and cut expenses.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the board of directors, driven by sliding profits,
decided to cut 11,000 employees worldwide. The figure was later
raised to 14,000. However, the downsizing plan was only met
halfway to date.
</P>
<P>
Ramqvist said the board was also "dissatisfied" with Nilsson's
lack of strong and effective measures to come up with new products,
which affected the company's profitability.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson's leadership shake-up led its shares on Stockholm's
exchange to drop by about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson is Sweden's biggest company and the world's third
largest mobile phone maker. It has more than 100,000 employees in
140 countries.

<HEADLINE> Comeback Fu Looks Rusty in Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 7 (Xinhua) -- China's three-time Olympic
diving champion Fu Mingxia still struggled to shake off the rust
after her comeback despite winning the women's 10-meter platform
title Wednesday in the 20th World University Games.
</P>
<P>
The student of the prestigious Beijing-based Qinghua University
nearly botched her last dive, a back 1 1/2 somersault with 3 1/2
twist, which only earned her 57.600 points.
</P>
<P>
But Fu, who will celebrate her 22nd birthday next month, still
took the gold with a total of 522.390 points.
</P>
<P>
Her teammate Wang Rui, who was awarded the highest score of 80.
640 in her last dive, settled for the silver in 522.000, with the
bronze going to Canadian Anne Montminy, who garnered 504.930
points.
</P>
<P>
"My performance was just so-so," said Fu, who became sports
fans' idol after her Olympic victories in the 1992 and 1996 Games.
She retired at the age of 19 after Atlanta, a sad news for her
fans.
</P>
<P>
"Since this is the first time for me to attend the world
university games, I am happy to win," she said.
</P>
<P>
From her triumph at the 1991 world swimming championships in
Perth, when the 12-year-old became the youngest diving world
champion, Fu has grown into a confident 21-year-old with a ready
laugh and twinkling coffee-brown eyes. She also dyed her black
hair brown.
</P>
<P>
Fu's next major target is to make another splash in next year's
Olympics, by bracing herself against any obstacles ahead.
</P>
<P>
"Now there are lots of excellent divers in China, so I must
first go through the national qualification events, " she added.
</P>
<P>
Fu's coach Yu Fen was satisfied with her protege's performance.
"This is the first time for her to compete in platform since her
comeback and some of her dives were even better than in Atlanta
Olympics," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We have one year's time prior to the Sydney Olympics, and she
can further build up her confidence through more competitions," Yu
said.

<HEADLINE> Ince Rejected by Liverpool and West Ham </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- West Ham will not try to sign Paul
Ince, despite Liverpool's willing to sell the England midfielder,
the London club has said.
</P>
<P>
Ince appears to be on his way out of Anfield, after Liverpool
manager Gerard Houllier reportedly excluded the 31-year-old player
from his plans for the coming season.
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation linking the midfielder with a return
to Upton Park, which he left in a storm of controversy 10 years
ago. But the Hammers have moved quickly to scotch the rumor.
</P>
<P>
Manager Harry Redknapp says he admires Ince, but there is "no
way" he would sign him - even for a "bargain" one million pounds -
because of concerns over the player's popularity at West Ham.
</P>
<P>
Ince outraged Hammers fans when he was pictured posing in a
Manchester United shirt before his 1989 transfer from Upton Park
to Old Trafford had been sealed.
</P>
<P>
After a successful spell with United he joined Inter Milan
before returning to Britain and signing for Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
The England mid-fielder's future has been thrown into doubt
following Houlier's blunt statement that "Paul Ince is not in my
plans".
</P>
<P>
"I told him that is life. For a player of Paul Ince's profile
it would be difficult for him to be on the bench. It is better
for him to have a fresh challenge," the Anfield boss is reported
as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is understood Ince will not be attending Liverpool's summer
training camp.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Supplies 30 Pct of World's Pepper Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- In the last 10 years, Indonesia
supplied the world market with some 41,000 tons of black and white
pepper each year, accounting for 30 percent of the world's
consumption of the commodity, an official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
International Trade Director General Hartanto Rekso Dipoetro
said in Bandar Lampung, capital of Lampung province, that Lampung
was Indonesia's main black pepper producer and major foreign
exchange contributor to the state from the export of the
commodity.
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, Lampung was known for its specific black
pepper called "Lampung Black Pepper," Hartanto was quoted by
Antara News Agency Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lampung's black pepper exports in 1998 reached 23,000 tons
worth 100.3 million U.S. dollars, but only 11,288 tons worth 41.2
million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the January-May 1999 period Lampung has exported 2,365 tons
of black pepper.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the world's pepper consumption has now
reached an average of 120,000 tons per year, with Indonesia
supplying 41,000 tons each year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the world's top producer of white pepper and ranks
the second in black pepper production after India.

<HEADLINE> Campbell's Everton Move Stalls over Transfer Fee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Kevin Campbell remains unsigned by
Everton after the Blues failed to agree a fee with his current
club, Trabzonspor of Turkey, according to local reports on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Campbell's agent, Paul Stretford, said the Turkish club was
failing to honor a clause in the striker's contract which would
release him for three million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Campbell was expected to sign permanently to the Merseysiders
on Tuesday after spending the last six weeks of last season on
loan to them.
</P>
<P>
Stretford said a clause in the striker's contract allowed him
to leave Trabzonspor for the same amount of money that the Turkish
club paid for him when he transferred from Nottingham Forest,
provided the then Forest management team had left.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Milne and Ian Wilson were fired in May, but Trabzonspor
president Mehmet Ali Yilmaz is reportedly refusing to recognise
the clause.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Seeks to Replace Imported Energy With Own Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government plans to
increase the proportion of coal and uranium in its energy sources
and reduce that of natural gas, which is largely imported, First
Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Kuratchenko said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a meeting on the country's power sources held by
the presidium of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kuratchenko
said that under the economic plan for the next decade, coal is to
provide for 50 percent of Ukraine's energy while uranium, 40
percent, within the coming few years.
</P>
<P>
At present, 43 percent of the country's power supply comes from
natural gas, which is mainly imported from Russia and Central
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Coal Industry, Ukraine has 140
mines producing coal for power generation, with an annual capacity
of up to 72.7 million tons. But these mines have been actually
producing only half their capacity since Ukraine gained
independence in 1991.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- English football club Liverpool
manager Gerard Houllier has defended his foreign policy in the
transfer market - and hinted he wants one more pre-season signing.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in which he paraded summer
signings Sander Westerveld, Sami Hyypia, Titi Camara, Vladimir
Smicer, Stephane Henchoz and Erik Meijer, the Frenchman hit back
at criticism of his League of Nations squad.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I said a year ago I would rather make British
signings and we have made some significant bids for players. But
they were either rejected, or the players were not for sale, or
they were put up for sale at a crazy price.
</P>
<P>
"The club has made a wonderful British signing in investing in
an academy which cost 12 million pounds and we also have players
like Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler, Jamie Redknapp, Dominic Matteo
and Jamie Carragher, so the heart and the spirit of the club has
been maintained."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Houllier confirmed he was seeking a replacement for
Paul Ince, who has been told he has no future at Anfield. He
added:" Paul Ince is on the transfer list and it was something we
did with sadness.
</P>
<P>
"We had three meetings and it was done with a lot of
understanding and dignity and he understands that. We need
someone to fill in Paul Ince's position but at the moment we can't
reach an agreement with Marc-Vivien Foe.
</P>
<P>
"It's most unlikely he will come here because he has a good
agreement with West Ham," he added.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador in State of High Tension: President Mahuad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador is experiencing a "Very High"
social tension due to economic problems, President Jamil Mahuad
said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president was quoted by the newspaper "El Commercio" as
saying that the social tension currently swiping Ecuador is
sparked not only by a nation-wide Taxi strike but also by
worsening economic situation as the country's inflation rate
soared to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, he is optimistic about better economic and social
conditions in the near future because the country is holding
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive day, Ecuador has been hit by a strike
of taxi drivers, who are protesting against the rising fuel price
and the government's poor economic performance.
</P>
<P>
President Mahuad announced a 13 percent gasoline price hike
earlier to trim a bloated budget deficit.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay Adopts New Measures Against Arms Proliferation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay's Interior Minister
Guillermo Sterling on Wednesday announced new measures fighting
against the proliferation of firearms in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new measures were worked out by the Commission for the
Study of the Proliferation of Firearms, said Sterling.
</P>
<P>
According to Congressman Javier Garcia, the proliferation of
firearms in the Uruguayan society is an "alarming phenomenon", as
there are more than 700,000 pieces in the country, which could be
translated to one piece for every four people.
</P>
<P>
At present there are 572,000 registered firearms and
approximately 172,000 unregistered, of which only 10 percent are
in the hands of security or defense personnel, said the legislator.
</P>
<P>
Gun-shot is the fourth main reason of death for children under
the age of fourteen in Uruguay, following traffic accidents,
drowning and burns.
</P>
<P>
There were 188 adolescents died of gun-shots in the past 10
years, of which 49 were below the age of 14 and 139 were aged
between 15 and 19.

<HEADLINE> Cuba's Suit Against U.S., Most Important Civil Procedure: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Justice Minister Roberto Diaz
said on Wednesday that Cuba's recent lawsuit against the United
States was the most important civil procedure in the country over
the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Diaz said the legal procedure had "a tremendous impact" because
the suit covers forty years of U.S. aggression against Cuba, which
can in no way be seen as an isolated event.
</P>
<P>
The minister is referring to the recently declassified
documents of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which are
being used in the trial by four lawyers from eight Cuban plaintiff
social organizations, which plan to call witness and victims and
file documentary evidence to show how the U.S. policies have
damaged Cuban society over a period of four decades.
</P>
<P>
Diaz said the U.S. government had cheated international public
opinion throughout all these years and these documents proved it.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed here in late May, requested 181 billion
dollars in compensatory and punitive damages from the U.S. for the
deaths of 3,478 Cubans and the permanent physical damage caused to
2,099 more people in a wide variety of acts ranging from the Bay
of Pigs invasion in the early 1961 to the bombing of Havana hotels
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The hearing of the procedure, starting on Monday will end in 30
working days, throughout which U.S. lawyer William Schaap, who has
filed various suits against the CIA, will be present as a private
observer.

<HEADLINE> World Coffee Production to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANIERO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide coffee production
for the 1999-2000 season is expected to contract by 1.8 percent in
the aftermath of a possible fall in Brazil's harvest, Brazilian
producers said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 104.16 million sacks (of 60 kilograms) of coffee are
expected to be harvested from this season worldwide, and the
predicted harvest for the next season is 102.86 million sacks, the
producers said.
</P>
<P>
The production of the robust variety of coffee beans, used
principally for the production of soluble coffee, will in the next
harvest amount to 36.3 million sacks, a 12.5-percent rise over the
previous season.
</P>
<P>
However, the global harvest of the Arabic variety, considered
to be milder, will drop by 8.3 percent, from 71.998 million sacks
to 66.3 million sacks, according to the producers.

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia's Interest Rate Drops to 17.15 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The benchmark interest rate of Bank
Indonesia one-month promissory notes (SBI) dropped to 17.15
percent compared to 18.48 percent a week ago.
</P>
<P>
According to a central bank press release, quoted by national
newspapers Thursday, the decline in the benchmark rate was in line
with Bank Indonesia's plan to continue relaxing monetary
conditions over the next few months, with the hope of seeing the
rate fall to below 15 percent at year-end.
</P>
<P>
"The improving monetary condition is expected to provide
positive sentiment to the process of sustainable economic
recovery," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark rate of SBI hovered around 35 percent earlier
this year, and around 70 percent last August.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia Governor Syahril Sabirin said the central bank
would allow a further drop in interest rates on the back of
expectations of low inflation and a stronger rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah managed to strengthen to 6,700 rupiah per U.S.
dollar, compared to more than 14,000 rupiah last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in March, April, May and June was 0.18 percent, 0.68
percent, 0.28 percent and 0.34 percent respectively, bringing the
cumulative inflation in the first semester of this year to 2.73
percent compared to 46.55 percent in the corresponding period last
year.
</P>
<P>
"We expect inflation to remain low this month," Sabirin was
quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin was confident that inflation for the whole year would
be in the single digits, lower than earlier projections of between
10 percent to 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, President B.J. Habibie seemed impatient to see the
lower rates translated into cheaper credits to businesses.
</P>
<P>
"The president has instructed the finance minister to study why
bank lending rates remain so high," Minister of Information
Muhammad Yunus said after a limited Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bank lending interest rates are currently hovering at about 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post quoted analysts as saying that domestic banks
need more time to adjust their lending rates to the current lower
interest rate environment.
</P>
<P>
They said banks could not be expected to resume significant
lending in the near future, as banks were only now recovering from
the economic onslaught.

<HEADLINE> Balkan Stability Plan to Come out at Month End: Solana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 7 (Xinhua) -- NATO General-Secretary Javier
Solana announced here Wednesday that a stability plan for the
Balkans will be unveiled at the end of this month, with its
implementation guaranteed jointly by the military bloc, the United
Nations, the World Bank and the Organization for Security and Co-
operation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Solana, who made the announcement in talks with Romanian Prime
Minister Radu Vasile, assured that the plan, which covers
political, economic and security sectors, will turn a new leaf in
the history of the crisis-ridden region.
</P>
<P>
The plan, worked out by western powers and Russia at their
Cologne summit at the end of last month, is designed to help
Balkan countries with economic reconstruction and stabilization.
</P>
<P>
Realization of stability in Eastern and Southern Europe is of
great significance for the Balkan countries and Europe as a whole
to smoothly step into the 21st century, said the NATO chief.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who arrived here Wednesday night for a brief visit to
Romania, will exchange views with Romanian leaders on issues
concerning the current situation in the Balkans after the end of
the 78-day NATO pounding of Yugoslavia and Romania's NATO
membership.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Romania for its support for the alliance's military
operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Solana is the second western official to visit this country
since the end of the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia. U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright paid a three-hour visit on
June 22.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: EU, U.S. Row Over Global Competition Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission's plans
for establishing worldwide competition rules have been criticized
by the United States. The row between the European Union (EU) and
the United States focused on whether the World Trade Organization
(WTO) should have its own power to enforce global competition law
to prevent monopolies at a time when trade barriers are coming
down.
</P>
<P>
Leon Brittan, the EU commissioner for trade, who presented the
EU executive's competition plans, suggested that WTO members agree
to enact anti-trust laws and create agencies to enforce them,
according to the July 7 issue of the European Report, a
fortnightly journal of the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
The EU and U.S. widely differed over whether the anti-trust
issue should be put on the agenda of the WTO's Seattle talks in
November. At a conference in Paris last week hosted by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), U.S.
Assistant Attorney-General Joel Klein said it was "entirely too
early" to talk about granting WTO the powers to enforce
competition laws because the body had no real experience with the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The senior U.S. official said Brittan's proposal was "a bad
idea" because any WTO negotiations "must build on experience and
commitment, not on hopes and vague concepts."
</P>
<P>
"WTO antitrust rules would be useless, pernicious, or both, and
would serve only to politicize the long-term future of
international antitrust enforcement," he told the OECD meeting
while calling for an overall program involving expanded and
deepened cooperative enforcement efforts on a bilateral basis.
</P>
<P>
However, Brittan said that bilateral coordination of procedures
was not sufficient if national laws were not designed to address
market access issues which foreign firms might face.
</P>
<P>
"These problems can only be resolved if countries around the
world enact sound competition principles and enforce them
effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, as government restrictions to trade are progressively
reduced, there is increased concern that the benefits of trade
liberalization could be denied through anti-competitive business
practices with market foreclosure effects," he noted. He cited the
examples that national players were organizing themselves into
import or market-sharing cartels and exclusive distribution
practices were used to keep new competitors from abroad out of
their markets.
</P>
<P>
The chief EU trade negotiator emphasized that a global
framework was needed to cope with the increasing number of
antitrust cases that had an international dimension.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the American recourse to extraterritorial
application of its laws merely annoyed other countries rather than
got their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Experts worldwide are currently concerned over the issue of
monopoly, including the question of how to protect consumers from
enterprises that jack up prices higher than they would be if
competitive conditions prevailed.
</P>
<P>
"As official barriers to trade and investment fall", said
Donald Johnston, secretary-general of the OECD, companies have "
greater incentives to engage in anti-competitive conduct to
protect markets."
</P>
<P>
"Anti-competitive practices are not only detrimental to the
welfare of the country where they take place but are a matter of
legitimate concern to other trading partners," Brittan pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the EU and the U.S. shows that monopoly is
still a key threat to world trade, even though all the 135 WTO
members, half of which have competition laws, are pushing ahead
with world trade liberalization which promotes business
competition.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Zoo Puts Obese Animals on Diet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese zoo has successfully put
its overweight carnivorous animals on a partially vegetarian diet
to make them slim down over the past seven months.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 carnivorous animals, including tigers, lions and
leopards, at the Hefei City Zoo in Hefei, capital of east China's
Anhui Province, are now adapted to the new diet, of which, 80
percent is meat and the other 20 percent is vegetables, and they
have lost weight by an average 4 to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Obesity in captive carnivorous animals has become a thorny
problem to an increasing number of zoos over the world, and in the
Hefei City Zoo, most carnivorous animals had grown fat because of
the rich diet of pure meat and lack of exercise, noted Wu Zhi'an,
head of the zoo's general management section.
</P>
<P>
"Some of them even developed a beer gut and rolls of fat on
their bottoms and walked falteringly," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
What worried zoo keepers most was that many animals had
suffered declining health and lowering ability to breed as a
result of obesity.
</P>
<P>
A leopard even died of heart failure resulting from too much
fat around its pericardium in 1993, as an autopsy found.
</P>
<P>
The zoo tried to control the weight of the fat animals by
reducing their food intake, but later gave up the method because
it cut down the nourishment absorbed by the animals as well.
</P>
<P>
Last November, zoo keepers decided on a diet change, replacing
pure meat with big meatballs mixed with maize flour and vegetables.

<TEXT>
<P>
The new diet was carefully worked out by a group of
nutritionists on the theory that the pancreases of carnivorous
animals secrete amylase that helps digest cereals, Wu explained.
</P>
<P>
"The tigers, lions and leopards all expressed strong
dissatisfaction with the green food at first, and we heard their
angry roars time and again," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
A tigress named Dongdong did not even take a sniff at the
unconventional food. Zoo keepers tactfully substituted meatballs
for her by large pieces of fresh meat covered with vegetarian
content and finally restored her appetite.
</P>
<P>
Lingling, a seven-year-old lioness who weighed 175 kg
originally and failed to mate last year, went on a hunger strike
for three days. While coaxing the surly lioness to eat, zoo keeper
Wang Haiyan had to lower the vegetarian content but then increased
it again gradually until one month later when the lioness was
totally accustomed to the new recipe.
</P>
<P>
Lingling, with 13 kg of weight shed after two months on diet,
has now regained a vigorous and graceful figure and gave birth to
two cubs recently.
</P>
<P>
Successful "marriages" are on the rise among these animals this
year, an indication of good health for captive animals, according
to Wang.
</P>
<P>
The Hefei City Zoo has about 60 carnivorous animals, and plans
have been worked out to apply this diet to all of them step by
step.
</P>
<P>
There is no need to worry about the animals' losing of wild
nature due to the altered diet, for it actually imitates to a
certain extent the natural eating habit of carnivorous animals who
normally eat some plants such as leaves and grass roots in the
wild to add nutrients, said Han Demin, a zoologist and secretary-
general of the Anhui Provincial Association for Animals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the zoologist added, a partially vegetarian diet is
more nutritionally balanced and is therefore conducive to
digestion and prevention of captive carnivorous animals from
obesity.

compared with the same period of last year, Vietnam News Agency
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam plans to export 35,000 tons of tea this year, mainly to
its traditional markets in Japan and the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has put additional 2,000 hectares of land under tea
cultivation this year, and another 2,000 hectares will be planted
with tea from now to the end of the year, bringing the country's
total tea acreage to 74,000 hectares.

<HEADLINE> Mayon's Temper Unpredictable, Philippine Experts say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The activity at Mayon Volcano has
reached a plateau and volcanologists have voiced uncertainty about
what will happen next.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and
Seismology (Phivolcs) said Thursday that Alert Level 2 is still in
effect.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring equipment detected four high frequency volcanic
earthquakes, ground deformation surveys showed sustained inflation
in the southeast slope of the volcano, and moderate steam emission
was observed rising from the crater during the 24-hour observation
period. the Phivolcs said.
</P>
<P>
July Sabit, a member of a monitoring team from the Phivolcs
told reporters Wednesday that the next few days would see whether
it would erupt or simmer down as in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"It is really hard to tell what will happen next," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Sabit, in 1993 volcanologists issued alert level 2
for Mayon but activity at the volcano died down after reaching a
plateau.
</P>
<P>
"It will depend on the activities in a volcano's magma
chamber," he explained. "There would be times when it would be
active and then it would die down naturally but when it is able to
sustain its activities, then that is when an eruption takes
place."

<HEADLINE> Canada to Sell Fusion Lab to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada is negotiating with Iran on
the selling of Canada's fusion research and nuclear reactor
technology program.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Center for Fusion Magnetics confirmed Wednesday
that the talks with Iran are entering into final stages.
</P>
<P>
"We're selling for 10 cents on a dollar or something like that,
" said the center sources.
</P>
<P>
The program has cost an estimated 250 million Canadian dollars
(about 170 million U.S. dollars) after 15 years of research and
development.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Center for Fusion Magnetics is a Montreal-based
research agency in charge of the fusion program, which is funded
by Ottawa's Atomic Energy of Canada Limited and by Hydro Quebec.
</P>
<P>
The center was given a final lump sum of 19 million Canadian
dollars (about 12.92 million U.S. dollars) in 1997 by Ottawa to
wind up operations after Atomic Energy decided to just concentrate
research on the Candu fission reactor.
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, several Canadian scientists would work
with the Iranian government as consultants, the center sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The fusion reactor, called Takomak, is one of only 25 in the
world. The deal, if struck, would mark the end of Canada's
participation in the international quest for fusion, which many
scientists see as the energy source of the future.

<HEADLINE> China Continues Crackdown on Dereliction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China's prosecutors have pledged to
keep up their efforts to crack down on official dereliction and
violation of personal and democratic rights, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Such crimes still present a serious problem, and remain at the
center of public complaints," Zhao Hong, deputy procurator-general
of the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP), was quoted by the
newspaper as saying during a recent forum on procuratorial work.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the SPP, China's highest prosecuting organ,
indicate that, during the first five months of this year,
prosecutors put nearly 1,500 cases on file for investigation and
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
There were 174 cases of abuse of power, 451 cases of
dereliction of duty and 476 cases of violation of the citizens'
personal and democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2,000 suspects were arrested between January and May,
including 42 leading officials of or above the county level.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors' efforts have recouped more than 23 million yuan (
about 2.8 million U.S. dollars) worth of losses, according to SPP.
</P>
<P>
In January, official corruption led to the collapse of the
Rainbow Bridge in Qijiang County in southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality, claiming 40 lives. Zhang Kaike, former Party
secretary of the county, was brought to court this week.
</P>
<P>
A heavy blow should be rendered against the abuse of power and
dereliction of government officials, which bring great losses of
life and property to the public, said Zhao.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj broke the
men's mile world record when he clocked three minutes 43.13
seconds at the second IAAF Golden League meeting of the season
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Guerrouj, who broke the 1,500 meters world mark on the same
track last year, was chased all the way by Kenya's Noah Ngeny in
the last lap and crossed the finish line just a few strides ahead
of his closest rival.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan slimmed 1.26 seconds off the previous mark of 3:44.
39, which was set by Algeria's Noureddine Morceli in Rieti, Italy
in September 1993. Ngeny also finished inside the old record time
in 3:43.40.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Maurice Greene equaled the third-fastest
men's 100 meters of all time when he won easily in 9.85 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The American, who set a world record of 9.79 seconds in Athens

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Foreign Ministry on Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been pursuing a foreign
policy of "positive neutrality" since it regained its independence
on January 4, 1948 and has declared that its policy would best
serve the national interests as well as the interests of world
peace and security by standing on the side of justice in
international issues and by refusing to be aligned with any group
or power bloc.
</P>
<P>
"It is a policy which remains valid today," the Myanmar Foreign
Ministry said in its currently published "Diplomatic Handbook"
which aims to introduce Myanmar's diplomacy to the world.
</P>
<P>
The handbook stresses that Myanmar's basic principles of its
foreign policy are:
</P>
<P>
-- respect for equality among peoples and among nations and the
upholding of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence;
</P>
<P>
-- taking a non-aligned, independent and just stand in
international issues;
</P>
<P>
-- maintaining friendly relations with all nations, and
good-neighborly relations with neighboring states;
</P>
<P>
-- the continued support of, and active participation in the
U.N. and its subsidiary organizations;
</P>
<P>
-- the pursuance of mutually beneficial bilateral and
multilateral cooperation programs;
</P>
<P>
-- regional consultation and beneficial cooperation in regional
economic and social affairs;
</P>
<P>
-- active participation in the maintenance of world peace and
security, opposition to imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism,
interference, aggression and domination of one state by another
and the creation of equitable economic conditions;
</P>
<P>
-- and acceptance of foreign aid which is beneficial to
national development, provided there are no strings attached.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Eyeing on Billiards Golds at SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The All Indonesian Billiards
Association (POBSI) has set a target of two gold medals at the
20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei Darussalam next month,
The Jakarta Post reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
POBSI spokesman Basuki Santoso said the medals were expected
from the ball nine and ball 15 events. "We don't know if the
golds will come from an individual or a team for the two events.
We have Robby Suharli and Alwi in the ball nine and Suwito in the
ball 15 events," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we still have a key player Rudy Sulaiman, who just
finished second in the Melbourne Cup. Rudy is studying for his
masters degree in business administration at the Homesglen TAFE
Institute in Melbourne," he said.
</P>
<P>
POBSI was included in Indonesia's second category sports events
-- those which only stand a chance of winning a bronze -- along
with basketball, bowling, golf, hockey, shooting, soccer, sepak
takraw and squash.
</P>
<P>
But the National Sports Council (KONI) official in charge of
athletes development program Mochammad Hindarto said POBSI
officials could assure KONI their athletes could win two golds at
the biennial event from August 7 to 15.
</P>
<P>
Basuki said Indonesian nine ball players would face a tough
challenge from Warren Kiamchuk and Everen Reyes of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"In the pool event, we'll face challenges from Thailand and the
Philippines, while in the snooker, Thailand and Malaysia are
likely to dominate the events," he said.
</P>
<P>
Basuki said to overcome the psychological barriers which
usually hit national athletes, POBSI had sent its players to
compete in the Asian Championships from June 25 to 27. But POBSI
was unable to send snooker players for an overseas stint due to
financial constraints.
</P>
<P>
"KONI only allocated a 1.5 million rupiah (224 U.S. dollars)
budget per athlete for the tryout. The figure is definitely not
enough," he added.

<HEADLINE> North China City Renovates Famous Prison for War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hushun city in northeast China
's Liaoning province plans to inject six million yuan into
renovating a famous prison for war criminals which was once
resided by the last Chinese emperor Puyi.
</P>
<P>
Renovation work started as early as last February, and the site
is expected to reopen to public on September 8.
</P>
<P>
Built in 1950, the prison was a place to reform war criminals
including Puyi, Japanese army officers captured in their invasion
of China, and some generals of the Kuomintang captured during the
liberation war.
</P>
<P>
The site was transformed into a base for education in
patriotism and for tourism destination in late 1960s. However,
serious damages were reported in its buildings and related
facilities due to lack of repair and reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
After the renovation project, the site is expected to be
divided into three special areas including two exhibition halls
and a collection of sites including the abode, bathroom and a
barber's place of the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Also, former exhibits will be re-arranged and new exhibits will
be added including some photos, historical documents, and some
articles once used by the war criminals.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Imposes Tariffs on Australia, New Zealand Lamb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton Administration moved
on Wednesday to limit lamb imports and imposed penalty tariffs
after U.S. ranchers complained that Australia and New Zealand lamb
flooding into the country was driving them out of business.
</P>
<P>
Beginning July 22, a 9 percent tariff will be imposed on the
first 31,851 metric tons, the amount of lamb imported last year.
Shipments above that level will carry a 40 percent tariff, the
White House said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This package has been carefully designed to help achieve
sustained competitiveness for the U.S. industry and is fully
consistent with our international trade obligations," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
American ranchers had complained that current tariffs of less
than 1 percent were too low to protect them from foreign
competitors flooding the U.S. market with their exports.
</P>
<P>
Australia and New Zealand account for 95 percent of the lamb
imported into the United States. Importers have contended that
higher tariffs would violate World Trade Organization rules.
</P>
<P>
Under this three-year tariff rising program, the tariffs set on
lamb import below the quota level will be cut to 6 percent in the
second year and 3 percent in the third year. The quota level will
increase by an additional 857 metric tons in the second and third
years.
</P>
<P>
Lamb imported above the quota amount will be subject to a 40
percent tariff in the first year, dropping to 32 percent in the
second year and 24 percent in the third year.
</P>
<P>
The program also includes 100 million U.S. dollars of
government aid to help the U.S. lamb industry develop methods to
reduce operating costs so that U.S. lamb will be in a better
position to compete after the program ends.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government acted after the U.S. International Trade
Commission ruled in a trade case filed by the American Sheep
Industry Association and other industry groups that U.S. producers
were being harmed by a surge in lamb imports.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Additional Fund for SEA Games Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's 20th Southeast Asian
SEA) Games team may feel much relieved at the news that the
National Sports Council (KONI) chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar had
approved an additional sum of two billion rupiah (298,500 U.S.
dollars) for the team's trip to and competitions at the Games.
</P>
<P>
Mochammad Hindarto, a KONI official in charge of athletes
development program, said that so far KONI had collected 12
billion rupiah for the contingent's transportation and
accommodation during the biennial event August 7-15 in Brunei
Darussalam.
</P>
<P>
The National Development and Planning Board and the Gelora
Senayan Management Board have provided 5.5 billion rupiah and 4.5
billion rupiah respectively.
</P>
<P>
"But the 10 billion rupiah budget was not enough as we still
needed to add 500 million rupiah. We're lucky that Wismoyo
understood our need," Hindarto said, adding that the money could
be used to buy sports equipment to support athletes performances
in the event.
</P>
<P>
The additional sum of money was part of a seven billion rupiah
donation from the State Enterprises annual profits, according to
the newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
But Wismoyo was not happy with the medal targets for the SEA
Games set by the country's sports organizations.
</P>
<P>
SEA Games training executive director Imron Z.S. quoted Wismoyo
's statement saying the organizations were intentionally keeping a
low-key profile.
</P>
<P>
"In sports, we have to make the right estimations. If they can
win seven golds, please say seven and no less. Don't say they are
afraid of over-targeting. We have to evaluate right or we miss
targets. We need to know our rivals' strength. We must remember
that the SEA Games is a stepping stone to bigger events such as
the Asian Games and the Olympics," Imron said.
</P>
<P>
Imron was referring to the Badminton Association of Indonesia,
which opted to send second stringers because the top players were
focused on qualifying for the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Imron named karate, pencak silat and taekwondo as other sports
expected to win more medals than targeted.

BANGKOK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited line-up list of

KATHMANDU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Bandaranaike Kumaratunga left here Thursday for Bhutan after
completing her four-day state visit to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
She was seen off at the airport by Nepali King Birendra, Queen
Aishwarya and Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga described as "friendly and fruitful" her talks with
King Birendra, Prime Minister Bhattarai and other Nepali
officials. This is her first ever visit to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
During her visit here, Sri Lanka and Nepal signed two
agreements on avoidance of double taxation and boosting cultural
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As current chairperson of the seven-nation South Asian

contacts and free trade in the region. She also visited the
Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat.

<HEADLINE> Australia Angers at U.S. Restrictions on Lamb Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian acting Prime Minister
Tim Fischer described Thursday the U.S. decision to limit
Australian lamb exports as "doing something very wrong."
</P>
<P>
"This is not only outrageous, not only unwarranted, it is
actually reckless by the U.S.," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration decided Wednesday to impose a quota
of 31,851 metric tons on lamb imports from Australia, New Zealand
and some other countries, which would increase over three years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a tariff of 9 percent for those within the quota was
claimed and a punishing rate for outside that quota was up to 40
percent. Both of the rates would reduce in three years.
</P>
<P>
Fischer was quoted by an AAP report as saying that "ultimately
it is a case of might, the largest economy in the world, the most
powerful political unit in the world doing something very wrong
and not what is right."
</P>
<P>
Australia exported about 66 million U.S. dollars worth of lamb
to the United States each year and the newly introduced U.S.
restrictions will cost each lamb producer in Australia who
exported to the United States about 3.3 U.S. dollars a head and
cost this country about 6.6 million to 9.9 million U.S. dollars a
year.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said that he would direct the Australian
representatives in Geneva to take step in the World Trade
Organization, seeking immediate consultations with the United
States.

would suspend the U.S. industry's tariff petitions. Without the
agreement, Brazilian producers would have faced tariffs ranging
from 48-53 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary William Daley said the restrictions on
Brazil would eliminate the ability of Brazilian firms to sell
steel in the United States at cut-rate prices.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. steel industry sought tariffs against Brazil and other
countries to combat a flood of low-priced imports, which the
industry blames for thousands of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. International Trade Commission, in a 5-1
ruling, approved tariffs of as much as 71 percent on one type of
stainless steel from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South
Korea, Britain and Taiwan of China.
</P>
<P>
The product, sold in flat sheets rolled up like carpet, is used
in kitchen sinks, dishwashers and other appliances.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements announced Wednesday, Brazil will reduce
hot-rolled shipments by about 28 percent and accept 12-month
quotas of 295,000 metric tons. No shipment will be allowed before
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian producers also agreed to charge U.S. customers of
that product at least 327 U.S. dollar per metric ton, which is
above the prevailing U.S. price of about 300 dollars. The
Brazilian floor price would be adjusted quarterly if the U.S.
market price increases.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. industry officials have complained their legal rights
to seek tariffs are compromised through such deals, and major
steel companies and the United Steelworkers of America threatened
legal challenges Wednesday to the agreements. Other companies
supported the agreements after changes were made to establish the
minimum price.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department, in announcing the agreements,
concluded that Brazil unlawfully subsidized its producers and that
the producers unfairly dumped hot-rolled steel in the United
States at prices below production costs and home-market prices.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Privatize National Airlines Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
privatize the national airlines, Biman, by June next year by
off-loading 49 percent of its shares through a strategic
partnership, press reports here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Privatization would help the national carrier offset its
losses, Civil Aviation Minister Mosharraf Hossain was quoted as
saying at the parliament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I am hopeful that we would be able to off-load 49 percent of
the share of Biman by June next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Various irregularities had long been dogging the national flag
carrier, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hossain added that a total of 34.2 million taka (about 705,000
U.S. dollars) remained outstanding with 25 travel agencies as
ticket money of the national airlines.
</P>
<P>
Corruption and irregularities, such as unauthorized payment of
incentive commissions, unplanned expenditure for sales promotion
and transport of Bangladeshi deported from abroad, have caused
losses to Biman, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> New Study May Unlock Mystery of Alzheimer's Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A form of the very peptide that
initiates accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brains of people
with Alzheimer's disease may someday be used as a treatment for
this devastating ailment.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the findings, the U.S. Alzheimer's Association
said Wednesday that this is an exciting and encouraging study for
the prevention and possible treating of Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by researchers at Elan Corporation, a
leading worldwide specialty pharmaceutical company headquartered
in Ireland. Their findings are to be published in the July 8 issue
of the journal Nature, the association said.
</P>
<P>
For many years, the association said, scientists have
hypothesized that the presence of amyloid plaques causes cell
death and leads to a decline in a person's cognitive functions.
Scientists now have an opportunity to test this theory and begin
unlocking the mystery behind this disease.
</P>
<P>
The researchers immunized a group of transgenic mice -- mice
genetically engineered to develop Alzheimer's disease pathology
similar to that which is seen in humans -- with a form of the beta
amyloid peptide called AN-1792. The results of their study were
based on two separate experiments.
</P>
<P>
In the first experiment, the mice were immunized at an age well
before they developed amyloid plaque and associated brain damage.
After 13 months, the researchers compared the brains of the
immunized mice to three control groups of mice that were left
untreated. The group treated with AN-1792 showed virtually no
detectable amyloid deposits in their brains, while the three
control groups showed no reduction in the progressive deposition
of plaques. The researchers concluded that these results raise the
possibility of immunization with AN-1792 as a prevention against
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
In the second experiment, mature mice, which already exhibited
substantial Alzheimer's pathology, were treated with AN-1792 for a
period of seven months. The researchers found that the level of
plaques and related neuropathology was both halted and reduced in
the treated mice, suggesting that this treatment may clear plaques
even after they have formed.
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, degenerative disease of
the brain. It primarily afflicts older people and begins with
symptoms such as simple confusion and forgetfulness. Ultimately,
the disease leads to profound dementia. Approximately four million
people in the United States have Alzheimer's disease. It affects
one person in 10 over age 65, and almost half of all persons over
age 85. According to the Alzheimer's Association, the overall cost
of Alzheimer's disease to families and society in the U.S. is
estimated at 80-100 billion U.S. dollars annually.

BANGKOK, July 8 (Xinhua) - Thailand has agreed to allow the
import of wooden furniture from Myanmar to continue despite
concern that such products might have been made of Thai wood.

continue provided it was made in line with all the regulations
agreed last year.

Thai parties concerned met last year and decided to allow in
Myanmar furniture imports on condition that they have permission
from provincial customs authorities, and that importers pay taxes
at the port of entry and are able to produce documents to verify
the origins of their imported goods.

The import was permitted with the aim of collecting more taxes,

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Export Earnings Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's export earnings fell
short of the target in the first 11 months of the just-ended
1998-99 fiscal year, as major export sectors failed to earn as
much money as previously expected, The Daily Star Business
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The country's export fetched 4,761.91 million U.S. dollars from
July 1998 to May this year, some 7.7 percent short of the targeted
5,160.81 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total export earnings, however, exceeded the figure of the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal by 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Except the garments sector, all the major export sectors,
including knitwear, frozen food, leather, raw jute and jute goods,
agriculture products, petroleum by-products and chemical products,
could not achieve their targets during the July 1998-May 1999
period.
</P>
<P>
Export of manufacturing products amounted to 4,380.63 million
dollars, about 5.4 percent behind the target, while earnings from
primary products exports stood at 381.28 million dollars, some
28.3 percent short of the target of 531.66 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The garments sector earned 2,653.27 million dollars, 5 percent
higher than the target.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings from knitwear and frozen food stood at 935.74
million dollars and 245.93 million dollars respectively, 13.34
percent and 23.35 percent below their respective target.
</P>
<P>
Jute goods exports earned 275 million dollars, 3.7 percent
short of target, while leather export made 151 million dollars
against the 206-million-dollar target.
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the 1997-98 fiscal year's export growth of 16.8
percent, the Bangladeshi government set an export target for the
1998-99 fiscal at 5.8 billion dollars which was later revised to
5.63 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China City Renovates Famous Prison for War Criminals (RPT) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Fushun city in northeast China
's Liaoning province plans to inject six million yuan into
renovating a famous prison for war criminals which was once
resided by the last Chinese emperor Puyi.
</P>
<P>
Renovation work started as early as last February, and the site
is expected to reopen to public on September 8.
</P>
<P>
Built in 1950, the prison was a place to reform war criminals
including Puyi, Japanese army officers captured in their invasion
of China, and some generals of the Kuomintang captured during the
liberation war.
</P>
<P>
The site was transformed into a base for education in
patriotism and for tourism destination in late 1960s. However,
serious damages were reported in its buildings and related
facilities due to lack of repair and reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
After the renovation project, the site is expected to be
divided into three special areas including two exhibition halls
and a collection of sites including the abode, bathroom and a
barber's place of the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Also, former exhibits will be re-arranged and new exhibits will
be added including some photos, historical documents, and some
articles once used by the war criminals.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Starts to Sanitize Nigeria's Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The head of Nigeria's Petroleum
Distribution Company has been relieved of his job as part of an
ongoing effort to sanitize the country's oil industry, sources at
the headquarters of the nation's oil corporation said.
</P>
<P>
P. C. Okonkwo, head of the petroleum products marketing
company, a subsidiary of the National Petroleum Corporation,
received his letter of retirement Tuesday, after a meeting
attended by Jackson Gaius-Obaseki, the head of the corporation,
and senior officials of its subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
Other top officials of subsidiaries, including those in the gas
sector, are feared to have been affected in the latest retirement,
which is coming barely a week after 71 officials responsible for
the country's depots for refined petroleum were retired.
</P>
<P>
Inefficiency and corruption in critical segments of the
corporation has been blamed for the poor performance of the
Nigerian oil industry, including the recurring fuel scarcity that
recently characterized the country's experience.
</P>
<P>
The new Nigerian government, which came into office on May 29,
has recently focused on the nation's oil industry, which provides
about 95 percent of the income for this west African country.
</P>
<P>
Recently, it cancelled 41 licences granted by the former
military regime to companies for the sale of the country's crude
oil, followed later with the cancellation of 16 oil prospecting
licences granted between March and May.
</P>
<P>
Gaius-Obaseki, head of the petroleum corporation, recently
pledged to revitalize the sector to restore the confidence of
Nigerians in the organization which came under severe criticism
during the regime of late Nigerian leader Gen. Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
A supplementary budget that would take care of the expenses in
the Nigeria-led west African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, and
other developments, is being prepared by the Nigerian government
for submission to the country's legislature, the country's
spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Dapo Sarumi, Minister of Information, said ministries
have been directed to forward their supplementary budgets to the
president by July 15.
</P>
<P>
He said the president conveyed the directive during Wednesday's
federal executive council meeting, the second since the ministers
were sworn in last week.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said the supplementary budget would enable
the government, which is battling to contain a deficit estimated
at 300 billion naira (about 3 billion US dollars) in May, to take
care of the ministries created by the new administration.
</P>
<P>
The council, consisting of ministers and key officials of the
government, also approved the revised civil service rules and
financial regulations for the country's 600,000 strong public
sector.
</P>
<P>
"The intention is to ensure that public officers are aware of
the rules so that they (the rules) are not exploited by some
officers to intimidate others," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rules provide a guideline for the conduct of public
officers and the expenditure of public funds, two areas that have
were fingered for the deterioration of the country's public
service.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean President Urges National Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- President Tejan Kabbah Wednesday
called on his fellow Sierra Leoneans to learn to "forgive and
forget" in rehabilitating the war-torn west African country, a
report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before signing the peace accord with the rebels in
Togolese capital Lome, the president introduced a mutilated woman
and a child to the audience, saying that they are the victims of
the war waged by the rebel Revolutionary United Front's forces.
</P>
<P>
Despite the atrocities made by the rebels, the Sierra Leonean
people should learn to "forgive and forget" and pool their efforts
in achieving a true national reconciliation, said Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The signing process began following Kabbah's speech.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Kabbah and rebel leader Foday Sankoh, presidents
of Nigeria, Liberia, Burkina Faso and Togo as well as
representatives of the U. N. and other international organizations
started signing their names on many places of the stacked
documents.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who led the rebels in fighting successive governments
since 1991 latter addressed the ceremony, and Togo's Foreign
minister Kokou Koffigoh, also a general coordinator of the
seven-week peace talks, would release a communique.
</P>
<P>
The accord, agreed to only on Wednesday morning, stipulates
that the rebels will be disarmed and share power with the elected
Kabbah administration by acquiring several ministerial posts in a
transitional government.
</P>
<P>
But the Nigeria-led west Africa peace-keeping force ECOMOG will
stay in Sierra Leone, according to the document, which was
formerly opposed by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Presidents from Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Liberia and the host
country Togo were present at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The mini-summit, called by Togolese President Gnassingbe
Eyadema, current Chairman of the Economic Community of the West
Africa States (ECOWAS), played an important role in removing the
final hurdles on the road to the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
All parties concerned, including Nigeria which has been leading
the ECOMOG in fighting the Sierra Leonean rebels and Liberia and
Burkina Faso which had been allegedly backing the rebels secretly,
were brought together to made a final push for a lasting peace in
the war-torn west African country.

<HEADLINE> Cyberjaya to Contribute to Economic Recovery: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CYBERJAYA, Malaysia, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said Thursday the timely completion of Cyberjaya will
contribute significantly to Malaysia's ongoing economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"The timely completion of the first phase of Cyberjaya's
development, despite our recent economic difficulties, is proof of
our commitment to all investors in the MSC (Multimedia Super
Corridor)," he said at the launching of Cyberjaya, one of the
world's intelligent cities and the nerve center of the MSC.
</P>
<P>
He said that even during the recent downturn the MSC was given
priority in terms of both budget allocation and policy support.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the government's full commitment towards ensuring
the continued progress of the development of Cyberjaya on a fast
track basis.
</P>
<P>
Cyberjaya is located next to Putrajaya, the new federal
administrative center, about 40 km south of Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia must continue to innovate and be even
more responsive to investors to attract knowledge from around the
world to help create the vibrant, creative, networked society in
Cyberjaya.
</P>
<P>
"Given its potential and importance, Malaysia has designated
MSC as its next engine of growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians, by and large, knew that the MSC represented their
future and thus support and participation in this venture had
permeated the whole society, said Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Malaysia did not view initiatives
similar to the MSC in other parts of the world as competitors but
more as opportunities for networking and collaboration.
</P>
<P>
The MSC is a 750 sq. km area south of Kuala Lumpur designated
as a hub for the development of multimedia services and products.
</P>
<P>
"We have started to build bridges with these initiatives and
together hope to overcome the myriad of cross-border issues coming
in the wake of the Information Age," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said there were already 32 world-class web-shapers
which had obtained MSC status.
</P>
<P>
He said from 285 companies which had applied for the status,
225 had obtained it and 21 companies, including eight MSC-status
firms, were already located in Cyberjaya.
</P>
<P>
"All MSC-status companies are expected to move into one of the
four designated cybercities within a year of Cyberjaya's
opening...I would also like to call on other MSC-status companies
to relocate to Cyberjaya early to reap the full benefits," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the official launching of Cyberjaya also signified the
last major building block of the MSC was in place and the
completion of several key complementary "soft" infrastructure such
as the various cyberlaws enacted.
</P>
<P>
"We have also put into place the necessary support in terms of
training and human resource programs for the development of
technopreneurs and knowledge workers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's commitment towards developing the MSC and multimedia
industry for the long term was vindicated by the latest statistics
from around the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said in the United States, although the high
technology services sector accounted for only 5.5 percent of
American gross domestic product in 1997, it produced almost 40
percent of GDP growth over the preceding two years.
</P>
<P>
Cyberjaya is one of the MSC's two flagship intelligent cities
-- the other one being Putrajaya, the neighboring new federal
government administration capital.
</P>
<P>
"Cyberjaya is a greenfield development uniquely designed to be
a global test-bed," he said. "We are not held back by rigid or
entrenched practices and policies. Cyberjaya will be a unique
blend of the best from East and West evolving to take on its own
creative culture."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Bans Bulgarian Airline's Flights to Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has ordered Bulgaria's
Balkan Airline to stop its services to Beirut as of July 15 after
it sold most of its shares to an Israeli company.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star reported Thursday that Lebanese Civil Aviation
Director Faisal Mikdashi ordered the ban after Balkan Airlines,
which had made three flights a week to Beirut via Damascus, sold 75
percent of its shares to the Zeevi Group, an Israeli company.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which is occupying part of south Lebanon as a buffer
zone to protect its north, is officially at war with the country.
</P>
<P>
Mikdashi said that this is not a blanket ban and other
Bulgarian carriers may still fly into Beirut.
</P>
<P>
"Balkan Airline can be replaced by any other Bulgarian company
capable of implementing a deal on flights between Beirut and
Sofia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Balkan was one of the few airlines that flew into Beirut
during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war and together with Greece's
Olympic Airway, was the main carrier between Beirut and the Balkan.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Ambassador Nikolay Andreev in Beirut discussed the
ban with Lebanese Foreign Ministry's director-general Zafer
Hassan.
</P>
<P>
"This is a political issue for Lebanon and an economic issue
for Bulgaria," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"My government is privatizing and the Israeli firm's offer was
the best bid tendered," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that political and commercial ties between Lebanon
and Bulgaria will not be affected because of the incident.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Thursday launched Cyberjaya, one of the world's
intelligent cities and the nerve center of his brainchild
Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC).
</P>
<P>
Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) is a 50 km by 15 km zone
stretching southward from Kuala Lumpur specially designated for
the development of high technology including computer and
information industries.
</P>
<P>
The MSC, created by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in August
1996, covers an area of 750 square kilometers stretching from the
Kuala Lumpur city center southward to the new administrative
capital Putrajaya and the New Kuala Lumpur International Airport
in Sepang.
</P>
<P>
The new capital and the first city in the corridor, Cyberjaya,
are scheduled to be completed by 2015. Major cities in the
corridor will be connected to each other by high speed railway and
express highway.
</P>
<P>
The MSC, which observers say presents the cutting edge of
Malaysia's commitment to ensuring the country is not left behind
in the IT explosion and will become Malaysia's pride, has been
acknowledged by world computer experts as a major effort to
concentrate on IT development with definite objectives.
</P>
<P>
The MSC will cater for eight flagship applications: electronic
or "paperless" government, tele-medicine, research and
development, worldwide manufacturing web, borderless marketing
center, multimedia funds haven, the world's first multipurpose
smart card, and Smart Schools.
</P>
<P>
Part of the funds for these projects is provided by the
Malaysian government with the rest raised from private sectors,
especially foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
So far, 225 companies have been granted the MSC status, with
most of them being foreign companies based in Europe, the United
States, Canada and Japan and joint ventures between Malaysian
companies and foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
These companies which have obtained MSC status would invest a
total sum of more than 1 billion U.S. dollars over a five-year
period in various fields such as computer software,
telecommunications and electronic equipment.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Leone to Move Forward with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The document, read by Togolese Foreign Minister Kokou Koffigoh
at the end of the prolonged event, declared the "immediate
release" of Sankoh, who had been on a parole from a death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
He would take a vice-president position ranking as the
chairmanship of the Commission for the Management of Strategic
Resources, National Reconstruction and Development.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front (RUF), which took up arms
against successive governments since 1991, will be transformed
into a political party and secure a number of ministerial posts,
according to the document.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the provisions in RUF's favor, the Nigeria-led
west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG will stay, contrary to the
rebels' previously insisted position.
</P>
<P>
For the issue of amnesty, a major concern for the RUF and a
controversy for the nation, the communique has only blurring
provisions. At one point, the document said amnesty will be
granted to the RUF combatants but at another it provides that
mechanisms would be reinforced to address the grievances of people
in respect of alleged violations of basic human rights
</P>
<P>
The issue, if not properly addressed, might be potentially
explosive, since the rebels in the bushes might simply refuse to
disarm for fear of reprisal and the long suffered civilians as
well as some officials of the Kabbah government may insist on
bringing some of them to justice.  Actually, the trouble has
already emerged when the United Nations immediately rejected the
amnesty provisions in the peace accord, despite its endorsement
of the agreement as a whole via its special representative Francis
Okelo in Lome, capital of Togo.
</P>
<P>
The rebels reportedly killed about 5,000 innocent civilians in
its January assault to Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, this
year. Recently, many international human rights groups have been
vehemently accusing the rebels of systematically killing thousands
of people, raping and mutilating many others in the their
decade-long war to gain power.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made Wednesday before signing the peace accord,
Kabbah called on his fellow Sierra Leoneans to learn to "forgive
and forget" to rehabilitate the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah will address Sierra Leone's parliament Thursday in a bid
to push through the peace accord. Skepticism, hesitation and
reluctance toward implementing the accord would be expected in his
government and country.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure many of you believe that the government has given
the RUF far too much already and the RUF has given very little or
nothing at all," Kabbah said before jetting off to Lome to attend
the mini-summit called by Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But he added: "I have no doubt you will agree with me after so
much pain and sufferings, after so much destruction of life and
property, we need to exercise patience and persevere in our search
for a lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
Presidents from Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Liberia and the host
country Togo attended the two-day regional summit culminating in
the signing of the peace agreement Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The mini-summit played an important role in removing the final
hurdles in the seven-week marathon peace talks in Lome.
</P>
<P>
All parties concerned, including Nigeria which has been leading
the ECOMOG in fighting the Sierra Leonean rebels, and Liberia and
Burkina Faso which had been allegedly backing the rebels
secretly, were brought together to make a final push for a lasting
peace in the war-torn west African country.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Hopes Barak to Reinvigorate Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan hopes that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak would act swiftly and breathe new life into
the stagnant Middle East peace process, the semi-official Jordan
Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the formation of the new cabinet and its success
in securing a tangible majority in the Knesset (parliament) will
usher in a new era which will bring the peace process back on
track," Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel-Ilah Khatib was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has repeatedly called on Israel to resume peace talks
with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon since Barak won the May
17 elections which brought down his hard-line predecessor Benjamin
Netanyahu of the Likud party.
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace talks with the Arab neighbors remained mostly
deadlocked since Netanyahu came to power in 1996 due to his
uncompromising policies.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who was sworn in as prime minister on Tuesday, is
expected to meet Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein before his
visit to the United States on July 16, Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1984, has
been a major peace broker in the region.

<HEADLINE> Manila Ready to Evacuate Farmers Near Mayon Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is ready
to evacuate farmers who insist on returning to 6-kilometer danger
zone around Mayon once Alert Level 3 is imposed for the volcano, a
senior official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Gloria Arroyo, also secretary of the Department
of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), told reporters that the
forced evacuation policy takes effect immediately when authorities
raise Mayon's alert level, which now stand at Level 2.
</P>
<P>
"As of now, no one lives in the imminent danger zone anymore.
The problem is the soil in that area is very fertile," Arroyo
said.
</P>
<P>
Many farmers are reportedly hesitant to leave the area because
of the fertility of the soil around the volcano.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo also reassured the public all government preparations
are in place if Mayon erupts.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology has
placed Mayon under watch since the volcano starting spewing smoke
on June 22.
</P>
<P>
It also raised Mayon's alert level to Level 2, which means an
explosion may happen in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
"While the volcano has not reached Alert Level 3, we are
concentrating on disaster preparedness, which includes the
stockpiling of goods," Arroyo said.
</P>
<P>
The DSWD regional director can buy rice, canned goods, clothes
and other commodities from the National Food Authority (NFA) once
the evacuation takes place, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The DSWD has also prepared ready-to-eat food good for at least
15,000 meals, she added.

customs data and management computer program in 12 of its 21
member states with pre- installation having been completed in
three other states.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Thursday quoted senior trade sources at COMESA
headquarters in Lusaka as saying that the system is part of a
comprehensive program aimed at enhancing the mode of customs
clearance and trade statistics processing in COMESA member states
before the realization of the COMESA customs union treaty in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Those that have so far implemented the program are Burundi,
Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Madagascar,
Namibia, Rwanda, Sudan and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Others are Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe, while pre-installation
inspections have been carried out in Kenya, Lesotho and Angola.
</P>
<P>
And system's implementation program is currently underway in
Malawi and Eritrea, Swaziland is expected to follow soon.
</P>
<P>
Although implementation of the program is one year behind
schedule, trade experts in COMESA are confident the program would
have been implemented by all member states before the October 2004
deadline for the COMESA union treaty, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
When fully operational, the national systems would be centrally
linked to the COMESA regional center where national data on trade
statistics would be analyzed and placed in a data bank for
accessing and use by stake- holders, they said.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister
Bill Skate on Thursday tendered his resignation to Governor-
General Sir Silas Atopare, but reserved his right to re-nomination
of himself for the post.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Port Moresby, Skate told reporters
that he would leave it to the government and members of parliament
to decide if he should be re-nominated when the national
parliament resumes on July 13.
</P>
<P>
"It is only they who will decide to tell me completely to phase
out and not to be re-nominated."
</P>
<P>
His resignation came as the coalition partner, the People's
Democratic Movement (PDM), joined the country's opposition last
month.
</P>
<P>
The breakaway of PDM, which has about 40 seats in the 109-seat
parliament, means Skate could not survive the no-confidence motion
vote against him scheduled for July 13.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- More than a million people
are at risk of famine in central and southern Somalia, the United
Nations has issued the warning as it launched a joint appeal for
1.7 million U.S. dollars for the next six months to cover
emergency relief in the region, U.N. officials said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was launched Wednesday in Nairobi, capital of Kenya,
by the Somalia Aid Coordination Body, a group of U.N. agencies,
donor countries, and relief organizations. The U.N. estimates that
30,000 tons of food will be needed to feed a million people over
the next six months.
</P>
<P>
The lack of rain, poor harvest and a shortage of pasture and
water for livestock have affected cop yields, the U.N. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Increased factional fighting, generally instability and higher
food import prices have also undermined food security for
vulnerable groups, they said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Food Security Assessment Unit says more than 30,000
tons of food are needed for an estimated 1 million people for
the next six months.
</P>
<P>
After a two-year absence due to dangerous conditions, the
U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) sent two expatriate workers back
to Baidoa last month to beef up the local Somali staff.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The organizers have felt the
pressure from the increasing size of the Special Olympic World
Summer Games and are considering limiting the scale of future
games.
</P>
<P>
Special Olympics Inc., which organizes and guides the program
around the world, admitted that the games cannot grow much bigger
than it is now.
</P>
<P>
"There's only so much event organizers can do in hosting these
events. I think we saw it in Raleigh in these games. We were
starting to press the limit." said Lee Todd, vice president of
games and competition for Special Olympics Inc.
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 Special Olympians along with about 57,000
volunteers, coaches and relatives involved in the games that ended
Sunday in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
Todd revealed his concern that potential transportation
problems lie with shuttling athletes to and from ceremonies and
competitions.
</P>
<P>
He was also worried about the logistics of updating results and
schedules for the athletes.
</P>
<P>
Todd said that the 2003 Summer Games slated in Dublin will be
of the same size or smaller than this year with the number of
sports likely to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
Special Olympics Inc. is also working on plans to organize
regional games and limit the scale of the World Games.
</P>
<P>
Todd said holding regional games in six locations around the
world would give the growing number of athletes a chance to
compete in high-profile competitions.

<HEADLINE> EU Sets Out Fourfold Agenda For WTO Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Vice President of the European
Commission, Sir Leon Brittan, said here on Thursday that the
European Union (EU)'s executive branch has set out a fourfold
ambitious agenda for the Millennium Round of global trade talks to
be started this November in Seattle, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The agenda, among other things, includes further liberalization
and rule-making in the fields of agriculture and services,
non-agricultural tariffs, investment, competition, trade
facilitation, and trade and environment, Brittan said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
He generalized the fourfold agenda point by point: first, to
secure further trade liberalization and market access, creating
conditions for competitiveness; second, to promote the further
strengthening of the World Trade Organization (WTO) system to that
it becomes a truly universal instrument for the management of
global trade; third, to take into account the continued need for
special and differential treatment for developing countries in
order to promote their development; and fourth, to ensure that the
WTO continues to address issues of concern to the broader public,
such as environment, health and social concerns.
</P>
<P>
"Our approach aims at cutting tariffs across the board, and
taking special account of the interests of the developing
countries. There can be no justification for developed countries
maintaining high tariff peaks in sectors such as textiles. This
has gone on too long and must be a major target in the New Round,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Comprehensive global trade talks offer opportunities which the
narrow sectoral approach never can. A new round offers benefits
not only to Europe, but to all members of the World Trade
Organization. Better trade rules and more market access are good
for business, good for growth, and good for jobs," the EU trade
chief added.

<HEADLINE> Australia Opens Up for Chinese Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Australia is to become the first "
western" country to open its tourist market for Chinese people and
from the end of this month more Chinese will have their dream of
sightseeing there fulfilled, as the limit on the number of
tourists is to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was reached over this matter by the governments of
the two countries in Shanghai last April.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Haicheng, a business planning manager with the Beijing
China Tourist Agency, said here today that newly-wed couples
joining the company's "Meeting in the Garden of Eden" wedding tour
program will become the first group of Chinese tourists holding
travel passports to go to Australia.
</P>
<P>
An increasingly large number of Chinese people with a monthly
income of over 2,000 yuan say they are willing to travel outside
the country, according to surveys made by China National Tourism
Administration in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, their wish is often obstructed by complicated
formalities required for applying for formal passports, because
only a few southeast Asian countries acknowledge Chinese travel
passports.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday urged Turkey to
stop its "massive military operations" in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said the Turkish
action has "grossly violated basic international norms, Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
Turkey "began an armed intervention in Iraq under the usual
pretext of ending the activity of Kurdistan Workers Party
militants who had infiltrated the area," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Turkey to "resolve the existing problems in
strict compliance with the norms and principles of international
law," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The international community should not put up with such
actions, regardless of their motives," he said. However, "a lot
of people prefer to ignore this," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Certain Western circles continue to rely on double standards
in international affairs and take pragmatic reasons into
consideration rather than moral and legal norms," the spokesman
said.

BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua)-- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
said today that his three day official visit demonstrates the

China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception celebrating the inauguration of "The '
99 China-Japan Year of Cultural Friendship" activity only one and
a half hours after his arrival, the Prime Minister expressed
sincere pleasure over the visit at a time when China is preparing
major celebrations for the 50th anniversary of its founding and
the 20th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Cultural
Exchange Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Since the normalization of relations between Japan and China
27 years ago dialogue and communication have greatly increased,"
he said, adding that while about to embrace the new century, the
two countries should further consolidate their mutual
understanding and trust, which were fostered over many years.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, cultural exchanges between the two countries are of
great significance," he added, expressing the hope the present
cultural year activity would help further deepen understanding and
promote ties.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Cultural Minister Sun Jiazheng noted at the reception
that the cultural year activity was agreed in the joint
declaration issued by the two countries during President Jiang
Zemin's visit to Japan late last year. He voiced the hope the
activity would help deepen understanding between the two peoples
and push forward relations between them.
</P>
<P>
According to the activity plan, more than 30 joint cultural
events including art performances, symposiums and exhibitions will
be held in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> India Recaptures Three Peaks in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Army has recaptured
two peaks in the Batalik sub-sector and one in the Drass sector of
Kashmir, killing 92 enemy soldiers while losing 38 of its own men,
Indian Army sources said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Troops of 11 Gorkha Rifles and a Bihar Regiment Battalion
recaptured the two peaks after night-long fierce fighting in the
Batalik sub-sector in operations to clear the peaks, they said.
</P>
<P>
With reinforcements entering some areas, Pakistani troops
launched counterattack at four positions but were effectively
repulsed, they said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 634 Pakistani regulars have reportedly been killed
in Kargil while India has lost 321 men including 23 officers since
the Indian operation began on May 8.
</P>
<P>
The sources said there was no qualitative change on the ground
in Kargil after Sunday's meeting between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Islamabad
showed "no signs" of abiding by its commitment to pull back its
troops and extremist elements from the Indian side of the Line of
Control (LOC), they said.
</P>
<P>
An External Affairs Ministry spokesman said here, "We are
concentrating on our military operations... The operations are
going on and we are in the process of evicting the intruders."
</P>
<P>
When asked about the prospects of the Lahore peace process
being resumed once India drives out the infiltrators, he said New
Delhi has a larger vision of developing cooperative relations with
all the neighboring countries including Pakistan. India would
consider the question of bringing back on track the composite
dialogue process only after the Pakistan "misadventure" ended.
</P>
<P>
Sharif just returned to his country earlier Thursday from his
U.S.-Britain visits and was expected to convene several important
meetings in the coming couple of days to discuss his visits and
the situation along the Indo-Pakistani border.

<HEADLINE> China, Japan Enter Final Stage of WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan have entered the
final stage of their talks on China's accession into the World
Trade Organization (WTO), sources said.
</P>
<P>
Inside sources gave Xinhua details after attending the talks
between Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(MOFTEC) Shi Guangsheng, and Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko
Komura and Posts and Telecommunications Minister Seiko Noda, who
both arrived here Thursday afternoon with Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
"Following tense negotiations over the past few weeks between
the Japanese and Chinese delegations, we have entered the final
stage of talks on China's accession to the WTO," said the MOFTEC
official, who declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached agreements in most fields, and both sides are
satisfied with the results," he said.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC Minister Shi Guangsheng expressed thanks to Japan for
its consistent support on China's WTO accession. He stressed that
China's bid to enter the multi-lateral trade body, which has
lasted for 13 years, is necessary because of China's current drive
in its reform and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts to enter the WTO are dictated and demanded by this
drive," he said. "China's entry in the WTO, on the other hand,
will help push forward the reform of the world trade system and
the development of world trade."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that whether China enters the WTO will not affect
China's determination to firmly carry on its reform and opening
policy.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks with the Japanese ministers, Shi told Toyota
Shoichiro, newly-elected president of the Japan-China Investment
Promotion Organization, and other Japanese entrepreneurs during a
separate meeting that Japanese entrepreneurs can play a more
active role in the development of bilateral trade and economic
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Thai Supreme Commander Hails Army Relationship with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Almost all senior military leaders
in Thailand have visited China in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
The fourth Thai military magnate to arrive in Beijing is the
supreme commander of the Thai armed forces Mongkon Ampornpisit,
who follows in the footsteps of the Thai Prime Minister and
defense minister, the deputy defense minister and the commander of
the army.
</P>
<P>
Now that the Thai economy is back on an upswing, the Thai
military immediately resumed its frequent visits to China, as was
the rule before Thailand became mired in a financial crisis two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"This not only shows that Thailand attaches great importance to
military relations and other bilateral ties, but also testifies to
the fact that Thailand and China are 'inseparable'," Mongkon told
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
"China is an influential country in the Asia-Pacific region,
with whom Thailand and other southeast Asian nations have the same
or similar views."
</P>
<P>
Mongkon noted that "Thailand and China share the same origins
in terms of politics, society and culture, as well as an identical
or similar stand toward many major international issues."
</P>
<P>
"We have no differences at all," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"I believe, that every Thai person will never forget that China
was the first country to extend a helping hand to our country" in
the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
As the leader of the Thai army, Mongkon expressed his
satisfaction over the relations between the two armed forces: "The
two armies are carrying out efficient cooperation in various
fields," he said, adding that the exchange of visits and
servicemen training, as well as exchanges in the defense sector
have shown good momentum.
</P>
<P>
At this juncture, Mongkon pointed to a Chinese serviceman who
worked as an interpreter for him: "We are glad that he studied in
Thailand and was crowned as the best foreign student in a Thai
military academy."
</P>
<P>
When the Asian financial crisis broke out two years ago,
Mongkon came to China as a government envoy to discuss with the
Chinese side measures to overcome the crisis. Now he is endowed
with the task of further elevating army relationships.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian, Mongkon
remarked, "You visited Thailand five times, but I've been here six
times, I hope that you can beat my record some time."

<HEADLINE> EU Commission Proposes Priorities for WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission put
forward on Thursday its proposals for the agenda of the Millennium
Round of global trade talks to be launched this November in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s executive arm said the final
proposals lay out both the case for a comprehensive round and
proposed EU priorities.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive round is the best mechanism for breaking down
the remaining barriers to trade, the Commission said in a
statement. "It will improve the European economy, foster economic
growth worldwide, and ensure the successful management of
globalization."
</P>
<P>
In the policy document, the EU executive body stresses the need
to achieve greater market access by reducing tariffs and non-
tariff barriers and improving market access in the services sector.
</P>
<P>
It also emphasizes the importance of developing new rules
governing trade and investment, trade and competition, and rules
aimed at facilitating trade.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations in all these areas should take full account of
the needs of developing countries and the objective of sustainable
development," the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The European commission's policy proposals have been submitted
to the EU's 15 member states and the European Parliament for
approval.

<HEADLINE> Rios Crashes out of Swiss Open () </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Struggling in the effects of a five-
week layoff, third seed Marcelo Rios of Chile lost to Morocco's
Younes El Aynaoui in straight sets at the second round of the
Swiss Open on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
El Aynaoui, 33rd in the ATP rankings, toppled the world number
nine 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5), ending Rios' return to competition
after more than a month off.
</P>
<P>
The former world No.1, who played his first event since French
Open, showed rusty form and could never get started against the
North African challenger.
</P>
<P>
The South American let go a 4-2 lead in the second set after
dropping the first in a tiebreaker. In the 12th game of the second
set, Rios made three unforced errors to bring about a further
tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
El Aynaoui moved into a wining position with a perfect serve
for two match points. Rios saved the first but couldn't reach a
forehand to the corner on the second.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean reached a semi-final here a year ago, but has had
up-and-down results at the 1,050-meter-high venue in six
appearances.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Sperm Bank Users Urged for Disease Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is urging
all the sperm bank users to be tested for a variety of
communicable diseases.
</P>
<P>
The move, announced Wednesday afternoon, came after the recent
official finding that 35 of the country's 49 sperm banks have
sloppy record-keeping and inconsistent testing.
</P>
<P>
In a letter delivered Wednesday, Health Canada official Robert
Peterson demands all Canadian fertility clinics inform their
consumers of the "small possibility" of infection.
</P>
<P>
"This is to advise you that as a precautionary measure, Health
Canada strongly recommends notification and testing of all
recipients of donor semen for infectious agents," writes the
health official.
</P>
<P>
The consequent diseases may include hepatitis B and hepatitis C,
HTLV-1/11, syphilis, chlamydia, neisseria, gonorrhea and CMV,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
In a Wednesday press release, however, the Canadian Health
Department said that it has not received any report of
transmission of infection through semen since federal regulations
were established in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 3,000 Canadian women are inseminated
each year through sperm banks.

<HEADLINE> Conference Will Promote Sino-Foreign Cooperation in Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A high ranking Chinese official has
called on the whole of society to appreciate the significance of
protecting the ozone layer and the promotion of international
cooperation in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao made the remarks today at a meeting of
the organizing committee for the 11th annual conference of the
signatories of the Montreal Protocol on Substances Which Deplete
the Ozone Layer to be held in Beijing from November 29-December 3.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting will hopefully exert a positive influence on
international cooperation in protecting the ozone layer and
further fulfill international treaties," said Wen, who is the
chairman of the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese government has always attached
much importance to the protection of the ozone layer, and holding
such a meeting in China proves that the country's efforts to
protect the ozone layer has gained international recognition.
</P>
<P>
The depletion of the ozone layer, first discovered in the 1970s,
became an issue of global concern in the 1980s when the
international community started to seek ways to avoid further
damage to the ozone layer which deflects harmful ultraviolet rays
from the sun.
</P>
<P>
The international community signed the Vienna Convention for
the Protection of the Ozone Layer in 1985, setting the rules for
international cooperation in the project. Two years later,
countries signed the Montreal Protocol, setting out the framework
for international cooperation in the field.
</P>
<P>
An annual meeting has been held by the signatories in their
respective countries, now totaling 168, since 1987, and more than
1,000 representatives are expected at this year's meeting in
Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Russia Against Discrimination in Balkan Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Thursday that
international economic aid should be provided "to all countries
hit by the Balkan conflict without any discrimination."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said
discrimination based on artificial politicization or division of
regimes should be avoided "lest new dividing barriers be built."
</P>
<P>
"From the outset of the Kosovo crisis Russia has been calling
for a comprehensive solution to the humanitarian problem of all
the residents of Yugoslavia whatever their religion or ethnicity,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The West has insisted that the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia be
barred from any major economic assistance as long as President
Slobodan Milosevic stays in power.
</P>
<P>
NATO's 78-day bombing campaign has crippled much of Yugoslavia
's infrastructure such as oil refineries, power-generating
facilities, roads and bridges. Automobile factories and tobacco
plants, government buildings and many residential buildings were
also destroyed or damaged in the air raids.
</P>
<P>
"A normal, functioning economy" is a major factor which can
ensure that human rights are observed, Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
Once the military phase of the Kosovo crisis is over, then
rebuilding the country's socioeconomic structure, destroyed by
NATO strikes, becomes the most urgent task, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Because there is no mutual understanding with its Western
partners on this issue, Russia wants the most obvious damage
repaired through humanitarian aid," the Interfax news agency
quoted Rakhmanin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia backs "the U.N. secretary-general's understanding of
humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia as including the rebuilding of
power and water supply systems, clearing the Danube, etc., rather
than only supplies of food stuffs and medicine which the Americans
and Britons insist upon," the spokesman said.

<P>
BONN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- German telecommunications companies
are expected to invest more than 6.8 billion dollars this year
amid the increasing competition in the telephone sector, German
news agency DPA reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among the planned figures, almost 1.94 billion dollars are
being invested by Deutsche Telekom's competitors to set up
additional fixed-network capacity, said Klaus-Dieter Scheurle,
president of the Telecommunications and Post Regulatory Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected the growth in the telephone industry would
have positive effects on employment, noting that for the first
time, payroll reductions at Deutsche Telekom would be completely
balanced out by new jobs offered by its competitors.
</P>
<P>
Scheurle said that the number of new jobs offered by the
competitors would grow by a projected one-third this year, or more
than 50,000 positions.

<HEADLINE> Second Flood Peak Occurs on Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A second, potentially dangerous,
flood peak has occurred on the Yangtze river, with the water level
on the Yichang-Jianli river section, in central China's Hubei
Province, rising quickly from 2 p.m. yesterday to 2 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
The water level had reached 52.06 meters at 2 p.m. today,
exceeding the warning level for the first time this year by 0.06
meters, the Provincial Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
The water level of Shashi in Hubei reached 43.31 meters, 0.31
meters above the warning level; while that of Jianli in the
province reached 36.9 meters, it added.
</P>
<P>
Too much rain over the rainy season caused the first flood peak
to be seen on July 1 on the Yangtze river.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the Yangtze's first flood peak last year, the
river's embankments in Hubei face much less danger, thanks to huge
efforts to consolidate the dykes and dams over the past year,
involving a total investment of nearly 30 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The fight against floods, however, is still facing great
pressure as the water level of the second flood peak has climbed
higher than the first, authorities noted.

<HEADLINE> China Given Funds To Protect Ozone Layer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China has received 420 million U.S.
dollars from a multilateral international fund towards its effort
to protect the ozone layer, according to Xie Zhenhua, director of
the State Administration of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
Xie, speaking at a conference held here today, disclosed that
200 million U.S. dollars of the money will be given to over 200
enterprises for environmental protection-related upgrading and the
rest will be used for washing out industrial products that damage
the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, China needs a total of 860
million U.S. dollars for its ozone-layer protection programs.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the international community worked out the Montreal
Protocol on Substances which Deplete the Ozone Layer, and China,
one of the 168 signatories, proposed to set up a multilateral fund
to help developing countries implement ozone-layer protection
programs.
</P>
<P>
So far, the fund has raised 1.14 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has issued over 20 guidelines for
protecting the ozone layer and its consumption of ozone-layer
depleting substances had declined to 87,000 tons last year, from
105,000 tons in 1995.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 50 Injured in Bangladesh Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- At least one man was killed and about
50 others were injured in Bangladesh on Thursday during a
dawn-to-dusk nationwide hartal (strike) organized by the
opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
A passenger bus was attacked by pro-hartal activists during the
shutdown in the capital city and an old man, who was traveling in
the bus, was seriously injured. He died after being rushed to the
Dhaka Medical College Hospital, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Several bomb blasts were reported in the capital city, where at
least 50 persons were injured at different places during the
hartal hours, but no major clashes between pro- and anti-hartal
activists were reported either in the capital or in other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 5,000 policemen and Bangladesh Rifles personnel were
deployed in the capital to maintain law and order during the
strike.
</P>
<P>
Reports said one policeman was killed and at least 10 people,
including seven policemen, were injured in bomb explosions
Wednesday night in central Dhaka, when pro-hartal activists held
torch processions to drum up support for the hartal.
</P>
<P>
This was the seventh nationwide shutdown this year called by
the four-party opposition alliance, comprising the major
opposition -- the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the Jatiya
Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya Jote.
</P>
<P>
The opposition staged the hartal across the country to protest
against the passage in the parliament of what they called an
"anti-people" budget, "conspiracy" for gas export, soaring prices
of essentials, deteriorating law and order situation and power and
water crisis.
</P>
<P>
The hartal was aimed at delivering people from their sufferings
and safeguarding the country's independence and sovereignty
through compelling the government to resign and hand over power to
a caretaker government, opposition leader and BNP Chairperson
Khaleda Zia said.
</P>
<P>
Under a fresh program announced by the alliance's Central
Liaison Committee, the four parties would organize separate
demonstrations across the country under their respective party
banners on July 16, and stage road marches from the capital city
of Dhaka to different parts of the country between July 25 and 27.

JAKARTA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Forty cases containing ballot
registration materials arrived in Dili, capital of East Timor, on
Thursday from Darwin, Australia, aboard a U.N. aircraft, the

</P>
<P>
Fischer, head of the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET)'s
Ballot Section, and other UNAMET staff were present at the airport
to pick up the cases.
</P>
<P>
"The cases will be immediately distributed among UNAMET
representative offices in 13 district capitals in East Timor,
where they will be redistributed among 200 registration centers,"
said UNAMET spokesman Ueki Yasuhiro.
</P>
<P>
In the near future, several hundred more cases containing the
same materials will arrive in East Timor, he said.
</P>
<P>
If all registration facilities and infrastructures are ready
and preparations for the assignment of registration personnel have
been made, the registration scheduled for July 13 can run
smoothly, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 15 liaison officers have arrived in Dili,

Britain.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal, Indonesia agreed

The ballot will allow the territory's people to choose whether
their homeland should become an autonomous region within Indonesia
or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United

summit is due to be held in the Algerian capital Algiers from July
12 to 14.
</P>
<P>
But the release did not say whether he would attend the summit
on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) scheduled for the
coming Saturday in Lusaka, Zambian capital, as announced earlier
Thursday by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is involved in the 11-month-long conflict in the vast
central African country, with DRC President Laurent Kabila
accusing it of backing DRC rebels trying to topple his government.

<HEADLINE> Drifting Bottles Set Adrift On Voyage to North Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, ARCTIC BOUND July 8 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese
scientist is following in the wake of the great ocean explorer
Columbus by casting a number of bottles with messages into the
ocean on his voyage to the North Pole as part of China's first
government sponsored Arctic expedition.
</P>
<P>
Meng Guanglin has thrown a sealed bottle into the sea every
latitude since the expedition ship, Snow Dragon, left Shanghai on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
"I prepared 50 bottles and the last one will be put on the ice
in the Arctic Ocean. There is the possibility that someone,
somewhere may find one of the bottles or even more, most probably
in the northern hemisphere," said Meng, from the State Oceanic
Environment Monitoring Center in Dalian City in northeastern China
's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The great Spanish voyager, Columbus, dropped a bottle into the
sea not long before he died in an accident in 1498. It was found
on a deserted beach 358 years later.
</P>
<P>
Residents and visitors in the Alaska State of the United States,
Russia's Siberia and the coastal areas of Europe are the most
likely to encounter Meng's bottles. "But all the coastal areas in
the northern hemisphere cannot be ruled out," said Meng, who has
been interested in the sea since he was a child.
</P>
<P>
The plastic bottles, previously used to hold mineral water,
were sealed with glue and inside each carries a number, and the
time and place when it was sent off on its journey into the
unknown.
</P>
<P>
An envelope, carrying the words "The First Chinese National
Arctic Research Expedition and Research Vessel Xuelong's Maiden
Voyage to Arctic" both in Chinese and English, and including Meng'
s address is also sealed in each of the bottles.
</P>
<P>
Meng hopes someone will contact him even after one or two
decades. But maybe he will never receive any answer to his letters.
"The ocean is not a reliable postman," he joked.
</P>
<P>
"If we are so fortunate that someone encounters the bottles in
the future, they will be of great research and collection value,"
said Meng, adding that it will help scientists research the
movement of ocean currents.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Human Rights Workers Tried for Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Two Cambodian rights workers
were tried Thursday in the southwestern city of Sihanoukville on
charges of inciting violence during last December's protests
against the dumping of toxic waste in Cambodia by a Taiwan
company.
</P>
<P>
Meas Minear, 30, and Kim Sen, 37, were charged with involvement
in illegal demonstrations and incitement leading to violence and
property damage.
</P>
<P>
The two staff members of the Cambodian League for Promotion and
Defense for Human Rights were arrested after two days of protests
last December and had been detained for a month.
</P>
<P>
The dumping of nearly 3,000 tones of toxic wastes, shipped from
Taiwan on November 30 by a Taiwan company, prompted violent
protests and caused panic among the residents in Sihanoukville.
</P>
<P>
Protesters, enraged by the danger of the wastes, destroyed the
building of the goods-inspection office and looted the villa of
the city's deputy governor.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least four died and 18 were injured in
the protests and road accidents as residents fled the town.
</P>
<P>
According to court officials the trial would continue on
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government Adopts Extra Job Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government Thursday
approved a 519.8 billion yen (4.3 billion U.S. dollar)
supplementary budget for fiscal 1999 to finance a set of measures
to improve the country's deteriorating employment situation.
</P>
<P>
The extra budget, approved in a cabinet meeting, was
immediately sent to the Diet (parliament). It is expected to be
enacted on July 19 at the earliest, with debate starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government aims to create more than 700,000 new
jobs by adopting the extra budget, the first for the current
fiscal year which began on April 1.
</P>
<P>
The extra budget allocates the 519.8 billion yen to a general
account. Along with 23.1 billion yen (about 189 million dollars)
in new spending allotted to special accounts such as one covering
employment insurance, the amount of fresh government spending for
jobs totals 542.9 billion yen (4.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The general-account portion of the auxiliary budget features
204.7 billion yen (1.7 billion dollars) in spending for the
central and local governments to hire about 300,000 more workers
on a temporary basis within two years.
</P>
<P>
Other major pillars of the supplementary budget are 200.3
billion yen (1.6 billion dollars) in spending to tackle the low
birthrate, and 90 billion yen (738 million dollars) to create 150,
000 new jobs in 15 promising industries including the medical and
welfare sector, telecommunications industries and environment-
related businesses.
</P>
<P>
Japan's unemployment rate stood at a record 4.8 percent in
March and April. It was slightly improved to 4.6 percent in May.
However, many Japanese private economists expect the figure to
rise above 5 percent toward the year-end as companies engaged in
restructuring are shedding workers.

NEW DELHI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive index on the Bombay

as against Wednesday's close of 4,321.51.
</P>
<P>
The national index, however, lost 2.02 points to 1,870.21 as

</P>
<P>
The BSE market Thursday rallied in narrowly mixed activity on
fresh purchases from foreign institutional investors and scattered
support from operators.
</P>
<P>
The activity on the BSE was at a low ebb due to a sudden change
in the attitude of the operators who preferred to wait and watch
the developments in the Indo-Pak border situation, traders said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Urges Middle Course in Ties With NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
Thursday that Moscow would follow a middle-of-the-road course when
dealing with the West, avoiding both direct confrontation and
unquestioning friendship.
</P>
<P>
In an address to military leaders in the Kremlin, Yeltsin said
Russia's relations with NATO and the United States "remain
delicate and difficult."
</P>
<P>
"We will not confront NATO directly, but we will not flirt
with them either," Yeltsin said, "We shall closely follow NATO's
moves and work out our tactics together."
</P>
<P>
Russia's ties with NATO, already strained because of the
military alliance's eastward expansion, plummeted to a new low
when NATO staged a 78-day air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Only limited contacts have been resumed between NATO and
Moscow in areas concerning the peacekeeping operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also singled out Russia's envoy to NATO, Col. Gen.
Viktor Zavarzin, to praise him for leading about 200 paratroopers
into Pristina on June 12, ahead of NATO troops' arrival.
</P>
<P>
"Russian servicemen must be presented with medals for Kosovo,"
Yeltsin said. Russian media reported that Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin would go to the Yugoslav province later this month to
present awards to the paratroopers.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu has expressed his full support for a peace deal on the
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reached in
Zambian capital Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deal included a commitment to disarm the ethnic Hutu
militiamen who led Rwanda's 1994 genocide, he said in Kigali,
capital of Rwanda, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu said he would fly to Lusaka, capital of Zambia,
Saturday to attend a summit which will endorse the peace agreement
to end the 11-month of war in the third largest African country, a
report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has allegedly sent its troops to support rebels in the
DRC who fought against President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
But the president has time and again defended the motive
behind his troop-sending as safeguarding the national security of
Rwanda, which is, to fight the Interahamwe militiamen and former
Rwandan soldiers who led the genocide of over 500,000 ethnic
Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
"As far as Rwanda is concerned, the most interesting aspect of
the agreement is that the countries involved have committed to
disarm and fight the Interahamwe and other genocidal forces, and
that was our objective," he told a news conference.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Hopes Barak to Reinvigorate Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan hopes that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak would act swiftly and breathe new life into
the stagnant Middle East peace process, the semi-official Jordan
Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the formation of the new cabinet and its success
in securing a tangible majority in the Knesset (parliament) will
usher in a new era which will bring the peace process back on
track," Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel-Ilah Khatib was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has repeatedly called on Israel to resume peace talks
with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon since Barak won the May
17 elections which brought down his hard-line predecessor Benjamin
Netanyahu of the Likud party.
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace talks with the Arab neighbors remained mostly
deadlocked since Netanyahu came to power in 1996 due to his
uncompromising policies.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who was sworn in as prime minister on Tuesday, is
expected to meet Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein before his
visit to the United States on July 16, Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, has
been a major peace broker in the region.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens High-Level Scientific Cooperation With Western Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China and the European Union (EU)
are to start joint high-tech research programs this year which
marks a new phase of Sino-EU scientific cooperation, according to
Xu Guanhua, vice-minister of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Xu revealed today in an interview with Xinhua that China and
the EU will, for the first time, make available to each other on a
reciprocal basis high-tech research and development programs based
on a Sino-EU draft agreement involving such cooperation signed
some months ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU has agreed to open its 17 billion US dollar
1998 to 2002 scientific research program, the fifth in a series,
to allow Chinese scientists to take part in research programs
covering the fields of biology, energy, aviation, space,
telecommunications and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister added, "China will also push for further high-
level cooperation with other world giants in terms of scientific
advancement."
</P>
<P>
Concerning cooperation with the U.S., Xu explained that China
is to promote more joint R&AMP;D programs, focused on pharmaceuticals,
telecommunications, new materials, micro electronics, agriculture
and will seek cooperation in basic research fields such as high-
energy physics, space, human genetics and other major scientific
research fields.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of high-level scientific
cooperation with Russia in aviation, space, nuclear energy, space
station and a number of other fields.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shaoqi, director of the international cooperation
department of the Ministry of Science and Technology, said his
ministry and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and National
Natural Science Foundation have jointly decided to invest 12
million yuan (1.4 million US dollars) for building several high-
energy physical installations for the European Center for Nuclear
Research.
</P>
<P>
He said this would enable more Chinese scientists to attend
research programs there. So far nearly 100 Chinese scientists are
working in the center.
</P>
<P>
The CAS, China's top scientific research body, has already
decided to allocate funds to several major Sino-foreign joint
research programs and some of its branches in other parts of China
will establish partner labs with EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the new trend in Sino-foreign scientific
cooperation, Wang said the raising of cooperation levels in this
field has encouraged cooperation in the respective industrial
sectors as well as promoting foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1997 there were a total of 8,
352 EU funded projects with over 30 billion US dollars of actual
contracted investment registered in China.

ISLAMABAD, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Thursday chaired a high-level meeting here soon after his
return from a visit to the United States and Britain to discuss
the situation arising from the Pakistan-U.S. joint statement on
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
General Pervez Musharraf, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Committee and army chief, attended the meeting along with cabinet
ministers and senior officials.
</P>
<P>
No official comment was available so far, but informed sources

<P>
Sharif air-dashed to Washington in the wee hours of Sunday and
held three hours of talks with Clinton on the Kashmir tension
between Pakistan and India.

<HEADLINE> HK's Exchanges, Clearing Houses to Be Merged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A new holding company, known as
the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEC), will be set
up as a result of the planned demutualization and merger of Hong
Kong's stock exchange, futures exchange and clearing houses.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government
Thursday published a paper setting out the business model and the
public policy framework for the new company.
</P>
<P>
The merger is in pursuance of the market structure reform
announced by the financial secretary in March, under which the two
exchanges and the three associated clearing houses in Hong Kong
will be merged by March 2000.
</P>
<P>
HKEC will be a public listed company owned by private investors
and the government, but the government's role would be minimal.
</P>
<P>
The board of the company will comprise directors elected by
shareholders and those representing public and market interests.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the market reform is to enhance the market's
competitiveness so as to meet the challenge of an increasingly
globalized market place driven by advancement of technology and
the emergence of a growing population of sophisticated investors,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The merger is expected to increase transparency and efficiency,
open up the field to more players and ultimately attract more
companies to list in Hong Kong, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Acting Financial Secretary of the SAR, Rafael Hui, announced
Thursday that Financial Secretary Donald Tsang has appointed
Charles Lee as chairman of the preparatory board of HKEC and
Dannis Lee and John Strickland as its directors.
</P>
<P>
Hui is appointed a director of the preparatory board of HKEC as
the representative of the government's interest.
</P>
<P>
Charles Lee is a member of the Executive Council of the SAR and
was former chairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Dannis Lee is currently chairman of the Hong Kong Stockbrokers
Association and Strickland is the former chairman of the Hong Kong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rejects U.S. Threat Over Arms Sale to Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday rejected as "
untenable and illegitimate" the U.S. threat to stop assistance to
Russia if Moscow sells weapons to Syria.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to reject as untenable and illegitimate any
references to American legislation that make provision for some
form of sanctions against Russia for providing armaments to Syria,
which is on Washington's blacklist (of countries allegedly
sponsoring terrorism)," the Interfax news agency quoted officials
of the Russian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian side has more than once, including at a high
level, brought it to the attention of the American administration
that attempts by the United States to give a supranational
character to its own laws to the detriment of Russian interests
undermine international law and create new irritants in Russian-
American relations during a period when a normalizing trend has
become evident in our dialogue with the United States," the
unidentified officials said.
</P>
<P>
Washington's threat apparently came after Syrian President
Hafez Al-Assad's visit to Russia earlier this week, his first to
Moscow since the breakup of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed "aspects of military-technical
cooperation ... in general terms, although they remain an
important component of mutually advantageous bilateral cooperation,
" the Foreign Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that what dominated Russian-Syrian talks during
the visit were general international issues, the situation in the
Middle East, the Kosovo crisis and the Iraq problem.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and Syria have refused to give details of their
arms trade, but Russian media said Damascus was seeking to buy as
much as 2 billion U.S. dollars in weaponry, including Russia's new
MiG-29 SMT fighter jets and S-300 air defense systems.
</P>
<P>
Syria is also planning to buy spare parts for its aged fleet
of Soviet-made fighters and armored vehicles. Soviet and Russian-
made weaponry comprises 90 percent of Syria's arsenal, The Moscow
Times reported Thursday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Employee Accused of Sabotage Leaves Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations employee accused
by Iraq of carrying out acts of sabotage in northern Iraq left
Baghdad on Thursday morning, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
INA said Ayan Broughton, known as Red, a New Zealander, left
Baghdad on Thursday morning and is on his way to Amman, Jordan
after it was proved that he carried out sabotage acts aimed at
harming Iraq's agriculture resources.
</P>
<P>
An official with the U.N. Office of Humanitarian Coordinator
in Iraq (UNOHCI) confirmed that Broughton had left Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Broughton, a supervisor at the U.N. Office of Project Services
entrusted with removing land mines in northern Iraq's Suleimaniya
province, was accused by Iraq of attempting to spread agriculture
pests in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said Broughton entered Kalar subdistrict in Suleimaniya in
April this year, and buried several boxes of suspicious material
nearby.
</P>
<P>
Residents in that area later dug out those boxes and found that
the boxes were containing eggs of locusts.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government condemned the act and demanded that
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan investigate it to reveal all the
parties involved. Iraq also demands that Broughton be put on trial.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Foreign Ministry summoned U.N. Coordinator in Iraq
Hans Von Sponeck earlier in the week and handed him a memorandum
of protest calling for ordering Broughton out of Iraq within 72
hours.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused United States and British
nationals working in northern Iraq, particularly those working
with non-governmental organizations, of spying on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Iraq asked the U.N. to replace U.S. and
British nationals working with U.N. agencies in central and
southern Iraq with staff of other nationalities.

<HEADLINE> Italy Unveils Plans for Football Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Italians will be well entertained by
soccer feast next season after the football League unveiled plans
for seven-days-a-week T.V. coverage.
</P>
<P>
The Serie A, which was traditionally played on Sundays, will be
split every weekend between Saturday and Sunday with Serie B
matches broadcast on Mondays and Fridays.
</P>
<P>
Tuesdays and Wednesdays will see the enlarged Champions League
matches and the re-vamped UEFA Cup on Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
Saturday has at least two Serie A matches and the kick-off time
on Sunday will be fixed at 3.00pm, ending the seasonal variations.
</P>
<P>
Spare slots during the week, when European action takes a rest
between rounds, will meanwhile be filled up with Italian Cup ties.
</P>
<P>
League boss Franco Carraro said that the fixed Sunday kick-off
time would be "something which will be good for football and for
family life".
</P>
<P>
"With the different kick-off times, it's always been difficult
for families to organise Sundays so that everybody is happy," said
Carraro.
</P>
<P>
Aside from improving the family life, the changes are
principally designed to exploit the rapidly emerging market for
subscription and pay-per-view television here.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Marigold Has Bright Prospect Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Overseas demand for Thailand-grown
marigolds is steadily increasing as the flowers are not only
well-known for their natural beauty, but also for useful
substances embedded, the Thai News Agency (TNA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Marigold or Tagetes Erecta contains nutrient substances that
are useful for animals and can be used to produce animal feed,
including those for pets and poultry, the TNA quoted a botanical
expert as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sermsin Klinchantr, president of the Thai Marigold Producers'
Society, said the nutrient substances are particularly in the
strain of red-yellow marigold while the yellow-strain flowers are
widely used for decorations and making garlands.
</P>
<P>
Demand for Thailand-grown red-yellow marigolds as raw materials
for animal feed has been steadily increasing in overseas markets,
especially in the United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the growing importance of the strain, the Thai
Marigold Producers' Society has launched a pilot project to
promote mass production of red-yellow marigolds to meet the
increasing demand, both locally and abroad, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The project is being implemented by member groups in different
regions, with a targeted production of 13,000 tons countrywide
this year on an overall area of 20,000 rai (3,200 hectares), she
said.
</P>
<P>
Sermsin said demand for marigolds in the United States is an
average of between 30,000 and 50,000 tons a year, while the
production capacity of the red-yellow-strain flower in Thailand is
about 50,000 tons annually.
</P>
<P>
The figure shows that if the pilot project to boost the
production of Thai marigolds becomes successful, massive
value-added earnings can be created for local growers in the
foreseeable future, she added.

<HEADLINE> UNITA-Downed Plane Not Military: Angolan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government has firmly denied
UNITA's saying that the plane downed last Thursday in the
northeast of the country had on board senior officers of the
government army.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Angola Daily quoted a statement from the Information
Ministry as saying that the Antonov-12 plane belonged to a private
transport company Savanair.
</P>
<P>
An indenture provided by the company showed that the plane was
loaded with 12 tons of civil goods, including flour, maize flour,
sausage and beer.
</P>
<P>
Besides the five Russian crew members on board, there are only
two Angolans escorting the goods.
</P>
<P>
"After downing two U.N. airplanes in a row, the armed forces of
(Jonas) Savimbi once again cruelly attacked civil airplanes. It
could only demonstrate the terrorist, inhumane and belligerent
elements," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on public opinion, at home and abroad, to
condemn such act by the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) to prevent more civil planes from being targeted
and downed.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government issued a statement Tuesday, demanding
the release of arrested Russian pilots. It also denied that they
were offering assistance to the Angolan government army.
</P>
<P>
On May 12, another Antonov-26 plane was downed in the same
area. The three Russian pilots were arrested.
</P>
<P>
UNITA had accused the Russian pilots of being mercenaries, and
asked for their due trial and punishment.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Dismisses Iraqi Accusation of Sabotage by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Office of
Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq (UNOHCI) on Thursday dismissed
the Iraqi accusation that a U.N. employee carried out acts of
sabotage in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
UNOHCI said in a statement that "neither Ayan Broughton, nor
any other U.N.-related person was in the area identified by the
Iraqi authorities on April 8."
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused Broughton, known as Red, a New Zealander working
as a supervisor at the U.N. Office of Project Services which is
entrusted with removing land mines in northern Iraq's Suleimaniya
province, of attempting to spread agriculture pests on April 8.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said Broughton entered Kalar subdistrict in Suleimaniya
and buried several boxes of suspicious material nearby. Residents
in that area later dug out those boxes and found that they were
containing eggs of locusts.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Iraqi government, in a verbal note
to U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq Hans von Sponeck on
Tuesday, requested that Broughton leave the country within 72
hours.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported that Broughton left
Baghdad on Thursday morning. An official with UNOHCI who asked not
to be identified confirmed that Broughton had left Baghdad for
Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, UNOHCI said that "the investigation carried
out by the U.N., including evidence from witnesses... seems to
suggest a case of mistaken identity."
</P>
<P>
The statement did not explain why Broughton left Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has demanded that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
investigate the incident, said INA.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused United States and British
nationals working in Iraq's three northern Kurdish autonomous
provinces, particularly those working with non-governmental
organizations, of spying on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Iraq asked the U.N. to replace U.S. and
British nationals working with U.N. agencies in central and
southern Iraq with staff of other nationalities.

<HEADLINE> China's Fastest Train Undergoing Trials (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China's fastest passenger train
started its first tests this morning at the China Academy of
Railway Science's Loop Line Test Center in Beijing's eastern
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
It is capable of speeds of up to 200 kilometers per hour and is
a key step towards express railway transportation, according to
Liu Youmei, an electric engine specialist, who explained that the
train will have further tests at 200 km per hour in the Guangzhou-
Shenzhen line, where it will be used later.
</P>
<P>
One imported train and several trains made in China, whose
highest speed is 160 km per hour, are currently being used on the
line.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the new train has an engine, a driver car at the
end, and five coaches produced by different locomotive or coach
factories in six different provinces.
</P>
<P>
China's first electric engine was made in 1958. In 1996, the
country succeeded in making the first semi-high-speed engine,
which hit a record test speed of 240 km per hour in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhonghao, the deputy director of the Railway Ministry's
Department of Science, Technology and Education, said that the 200-
km-per-hour train has an important role in China's high-speed
railway development. China expects to build a series of passenger
lines like the Qinghuangdao-Shenyang Route, which is under
construction, to increase market demand for such trains, Li added.

<HEADLINE> China's Fastest Train Undergoing Trials (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has about 70,000 km. of railway lines and an annual
passenger volume of 900 million people. But, in spite of
improvements in 1997 and 1998, the fastest passenger train still
doesn't do more than 160 km per hour, which doesn't meet the needs
for greater efficiency.
</P>
<P>
So, China is planning to start work on its first high-speed
railway, the Beijing-Shanghai express line, connecting China's
capital and its biggest industrial city with a train that can
travel 300 km per hour. At the same time, research departments are
actively trying to improve the technology for these trains.
</P>
<P>
Rong Chaohe, a professor of transport economics at Northern
China Jiaotong University, said that although there has been rapid
progress in aviation and expressways in the past decade, over-
populated countries, which are threatened by worsening
environmental conditions, will finally choose high-speed railways
as a major means of transportation for their obvious advantages:
ability, less land use, energy saving, and safety.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that China's railway transportation
volume accounts for 85 percent of the country's total long-and-
medium distance transportation volume.

<HEADLINE> WB Approves Record Number of China Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved a record 19
projects in China during the fiscal year of 1999 (FY99) which
ended June 30, with an investment totaling 2,097 million U.S.
dollars, according to sources from the WB's Resident Mission in
China.
</P>
<P>
The new commitments include 1,674.4 million U.S. dollars within
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
loan scheme and 422.6 million U.S. dollars in credits from the
International Development Association (IDA).
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, the WB's total cumulative lending to China has
amounted to some 32.45 billion U.S. dollars, of which about 22.25
billion U.S. dollars from the IBRD and about 10.20 billion U.S.
dollars from the IDA, financing a total of 218 projects.
</P>
<P>
The FY99 is the last in which China can benefit from the
concessional IDA credits, according to WB sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the WB's assistance program is now targeted at
the poorer and institutional weaker inland provinces, and the
amount of lending per project has been scaled back to suit the
actual financial needs of those provinces, leading to a lowering
of the lending level as compared with the 2,616.4 million U.S.
dollars in the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
About half of the 19 projects approved in FY99 have directly
supported poverty alleviation and social objectives, while the
others have supported infrastructure development also mostly in
the interior parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The nature of the WB's lending program in China mirrors the
government's efforts to cope with the Asian financial crisis,"
says Yukon Huang, Director of the World Bank China Program. "
Several of our projects in FY99 have supported the critical reform
initiatives of the government, such as those in the accounting and
pensions systems, state-owned enterprises and container transport.
"
</P>
<P>
"Other projects were designed to ensure that the benefits of
China's rapid growth reach the poor in the central and western
regions. Particularly noteworthy, in the wake of last year's
devastating floods along the Yangtze River, was the speed with
which the Government and the World Bank prepared a Flood Emergency
Rehabilitation Project to assist in the reconstruction of basic
infrastructure in three affected provinces," he added.
</P>
<P>
In FY99, the WB has also produced a number of analytical
studies and reports focused on the issues and challenges facing
China in its development and transition to a socialist market
economy, including the latest country economic report China:
Weathering the Storm and Learning the lessons, which elaborates on
China's success in avoiding the effects of the Asian financial
crisis and policy options for the future.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Japanese Fund For Protecting Giant Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A special Sino-Japanese fund has
been set up as part of the growing campaign to protect the
endangered giant pandas in China.
</P>
<P>
Known as the "Friends of Giant Pandas" it is a joint project by
the China Wildlife Conservation Association and Japan's Future
Generation Alliance Foundation (FGAF), with the Japanese side
contributing 2.1 million yuan (253,000 US dollars) to the fund in
the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
Katsuhiko Yazaki, chairman of FGAF, promised that it will
contribute a further 10 million Japanese yen (82,600 US dollars)
to the fund every year from now on.
</P>
<P>
Ma Fu, deputy director of China's State Forestry Administration,
said that it is always a long and arduous task to protect
endangered animals such as giant pandas. "We hope that this
cooperative scheme will further arouse public awareness to help
save this wonderful species of animals."
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas once thrived in China and roamed widely during the
Pleistocene Epoch but can now only be found in high mountains and
deep valleys in parts of China's Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu
provinces due to natural changes and human encroachment.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are only about 1,000 giant pandas
surviving in the wild. Feeding mainly on arrow bamboo, they are
graceful, gentle and good-natured.
</P>
<P>
China has always attached great importance to the protection of
giant pandas and in 1992, the country launched a special project
to protect them as well as their habitats.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, 25 nature reserves, totaling over 1,000 square
kilometers, have been established in regions where giant pandas
live, and 95 percent of them are well protected.

BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The red tides in north China's
Bohai Sea that were reported earlier by the State Oceanic
Administration have disappeared due to climatic changes.
</P>
<P>
A monitoring vessel sent by the administration has detected
that the red tides were retreating in sea areas close to Cangzhou
City, Hebei Province, and the old river-mouth of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The administration reported Monday that the red tides were
found spreading rapidly in the sea areas, covering 1,500 square
kilometers close to Cangzhou and 400 square kilometers at the old
river-mouth.
</P>
<P>
The administration attributed the fading away of the red tides
to successive winds, rainfalls and low temperatures in the past
few days.
</P>
<P>
People living in coastal areas have been urged to pay greater
attention to red tides and report them to the authorities.

<HEADLINE> DRC Peace Summit Slated for Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The long-expected regional summit to
endorse a ceasefire agreement by all the warring parties involved
in the 11-month war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will
be held here Saturday, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Copies of the documents in English, French and Portuguese to be
signed at the summit are being sent to the heads of state or
government of the countries concerned, said Chiluba, who has been
mandated by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to
mediate a peaceful solution to the conflict in the third largest
African country.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state or government will be fully aware of the
ceasefire agreement and the modalities to implement it before they
come to Lusaka for the summit because each of them has a copy of
the documents, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba was very proud to say it is a African paper in which
all contentious issues have been trashed out.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka document, hammered out in 13 days of tough talks in
the Zambian capital, says the United Nations Security Council, in
collaboration with the Organization of African Unity, will be
asked to create and deploy a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for national dialog between congolese political
groups, creation of a new national army, release of prisoners of
war and humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba commended the ministers and rebels upon their
negotiations on and adoption of the draft ceasefire agreement,
saying the agreement is the product of serious negotiations
involving the government of DRC and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He called for international material and financial support for
DRC to enable the peace process to succeed.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president also called on all parties involved to
stick to the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
After negotiations, ministers and representatives of 18 African
 countries including all the warring nations and rebels finalized
the draft ceasefire agreement and adopted it unanimously here
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Cooperation Needed for Financial Reform: Yam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Joseph Yam, chief executive of
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Thursday called on
regional and international cooperation for reforming the existing
international financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks at the third HKMA Distinguished Lecture,
Yam said that the existing international financial architecture
has failed to keep pace with the globalization of financial
markets and with technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
"The crises over the past two years have taught us that, no
matter how well maintained the domestic financial environment may
be, serious problems persist in what has proved to be an
increasingly volatile international financial system," Yam said.
</P>
<P>
These problems cannot be solved by individual economies on
their own, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the subject "Risks and Challenges of the
International Financial Scene," Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of
the Banque de France, offered his perspective on the reform of the
international financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
He identified five key measures for strengthening the financial
systems of emerging economies against external shocks.
</P>
<P>
These include the adoption of the Basle Core Principles for
Effective Banking Supervision; deposit insurance schemes; policies
to encourage foreign direct investment; adoption of "liquidity-at-
risk" policy; and policies to discourage excessive short-term
foreign borrowing.
</P>
<P>
On the promotion of efficient functioning of global markets,
Trichet said that full and reliable transparency for all,
including both public and private sector entities, would be the
most effective measure for countering dangers arising from the "
herd instinct" of market participants.
</P>
<P>
Trichet emphasized the importance of designing and implementing
internationally agreed standards for ensuring effective
transparency at the international level and urged that ways should
be found to involve the private sector more effectively in crisis
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Donald Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand,
echoed Trichet's views on reforming the international financial
architecture.
</P>
<P>
He also considered that the most productive focus for
international and national economic reforms lay in the four key
areas of strengthening financial markets, reducing vulnerability
to short term capital flows, promoting greater transparency at all
levels, and involving private creditors in debt resolution
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA Distinguished Lecture was first launched in December
1996. The aim of the HKMA Distinguished Lecture is to provide a
forum for the local financial community to hear and exchange views
with influential figures from the international financial
community. Thursday's event was attended by over 500 participants.

<HEADLINE> Indian Rightist Group Protests Against Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Activists of the Indian rightist
organization Shiv Sena pelted the Pakistan International Airlines
(PIA) office here with stones Thursday in protest against the
"manhandling of Indian High Commission officials" in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen of Shiv Sena activists converged behind the PIA
office in Connaught Place, a business center in the city, Thursday
afternoon and started pelting stones and shouted slogans against
Pakistan and its Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The activists fled
the spot within minutes when they heard that PIA officials had
informed the police of the protest activities.
</P>
<P>
According to recent reports, a staff member of the Indian High
Commission in Islamabad and a Pakistani diplomat here have been
manhandled by "intelligence people" and both were expelled for
conducting "spying" activities.
</P>
<P>
Delhi Shiv Sena Chief Jai Bhagwan Goyal Thursday demanded
immediate closure of all Pakistani business establishments in the
country. "They cannot make money here and beat up our people there
and support anti-Indian forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the same organization burned the Pakistani flag
outside the Pakistani High Commission here, protesting against
what it called Pakistani intrusions in the Kargil sector of
Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Israel Lowers Arab Expectations on Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel sought to lower Arab
expectations Thursday prior to Prime Minister Ehud Barak's first
peace initiative, saying his planned meetings with Arab leaders
are mainly designed to build trust.
</P>
<P>
Three days after his swearing-in, Barak will travel to
Alexandria Friday to meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
kicking off a series of meetings with peace partners including
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, Jordanian
King Abdullah and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"These meetings are first of all to break the ice, to create
an atmosphere of talk and mutual trust," Foreign Minister David
Levy told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The meetings are also designed to lower expectations, Levy added.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders have welcomed the election of Barak, who ousted
hard-line Benjamin Netanyahu on a platform to revive the stalled
peace process on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
While presenting his coalition for approval Tuesday night,
Barak told the parliament that he will push forward the talks
with the Palestinians and Syria simultaneously, calling on Arab
leaders to join him in creating "peace of the brave."
</P>
<P>
Minister Without Portfolio Haim Ramon suggested Wednesday that
Barak might suggest to Mubarak, as well as Arafat and Clinton,
that Israel and the Palestinians bypass or partially implement
the Wye agreement, which was signed and then frozen by Netanyahu
last year.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said that Barak prefers the two sides to move
directly into final-status talks, but will seek Palestinian and
U.S. consent first.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have demanded that Israel first carry out the
Wye agreement in full.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to agree with our negotiating partners on a code
of behavior so that even if there will be problems, there won't
be a stalemate," Levy told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Syria promised Wednesday that it will reciprocate any peace
steps made by Barak. Levy welcomed the promise, but said Israel
wants to see concrete deeds so that there will be
confidence-building steps.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks broke off in early 1996. Damascus
has demanded that the talks be resumed on an Israeli
commitment to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights,
seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, in
talks today with Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Kasymzhomart Tokayev, said that China places great importance on
its relations with Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Tang and Tokayev expressed satisfaction with
the smooth development of bilateral ties. They agreed that the two
countries should increase mutually beneficial cooperation in all
areas, according to a Chinese foreign ministry official who
attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted the increased mutual understanding and trust between
the two countries since the establishment of diplomatic ties more
than seven years ago, saying that the two sides have maintained
close relations, and their cooperation has also seen new results.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the fact that Kazakhstan gives priority to
its relations with China in its diplomacy, the Chinese foreign
minister said, and China is fully prepared to promote its good-
neighborly ties and mutually beneficial cooperation with
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Tokayev said that bilateral ties have developed in a stable
manner in recent years, and the two countries have successfully
settled border issues, and pointed out that the leaders of the two
countries have maintained frequent exchanges of visits, which is
significant to the growth of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kazakhstan will continue to further its good-
neighborly ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Tang and Tokayev also discussed bilateral economic and trade
ties and regional and international issues of common concern.

</P>
<P>
The BSE market Thursday rallied in narrowly mixed activity on
fresh purchases from foreign institutional investors and scattered
support from operators.
</P>
<P>
The activity on the BSE was at a low ebb due to a sudden change

<P>
BANGKOK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China will not seek spheres of
influence, nor hegemonic power in the Asia-Pacific region, an
official from the Chinese Foreign Ministry said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yanyi, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official in charge of
China-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) relations and
policy planning, made a speech on China's Asia-Pacific security
policies at the Center for International Studies of Thai Foreign

Yang said, adding that the relations between China and the rest of
the region will be further strengthened as China's economy
develops.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who is also in charge of multilateral security dialogue
and cooperation, proposed that Asia-Pacific countries enhance
mutual understanding and trust.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stone Buddhist Statues On Display In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Eighty stone statues of Buddha that
remained hidden for more than 1,000 years in China's Shandong
Province will go on display tomorrow at the Museum of Chinese
History in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The statues were discovered at the site of Longxing Temple in
Shandong's Qingzhou County. They range in dates from the Northern
Wei Dynasty (386-534) to the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127),
according to archaeologists at the museum.
</P>
<P>
Qingzhou was a political and cultural center in eastern China
and had an important role in disseminating Buddhism in China. A
number of Buddhist statues discovered in the county were smuggled
abroad in 1994 and caught the attention of academics.
</P>
<P>
The more than 400 stone statues discovered at Longxing Temple
was one of China's 10 most important archaeological discoveries in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say that the Buddhist figures contain important
information about the spread of Buddhism in China, but they still
have not found out why the statues and Longxing Temple were
destroyed or who buried the broken statues.
</P>
<P>
It took archaeologists two years to restore the statues. And
the show will run till November 9.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Quenching War-fire, Major Task of OAU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The outgoing century is often
described as " a century of Africa's liberty and independence".
However, decades after decolonization and independence, peace and
stability remain the biggest challenges facing the continent.
</P>
<P>
Armed conflicts, either civil, bilateral or multilateral, are
still plaguing the continent 36 years after the founding of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), a continental organization
aimed at safeguarding independence, territorial integrity and
promoting cooperation in the continent.
</P>
<P>
About one third of the 53-member continental bloc are involved
in military conflicts directly or indirectly, all of them
suffering from the scourge of war and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
A military conflict erupted in early August last year in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and quickly spilt into a
regional one, sucking in as many as six other countries nearby.
Despite repeated meditations and peace talks by the OAU and other
regional and state leaders, the final peace is still not in sight.
</P>
<P>
It is encouraging, however, to see that most of the OAU members
are trying hard to bring the players of the 11-month-long conflict
to the negotiating table, and more encouraging to witness that
many of those involved in the armed conflicts in the Africa's
third biggest country, seem ready for peace. Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni signed a memorandum on peace with his DRC
counterpart Laurent Kabila on April 18 after talks in the Libyan
town of Sirte.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, under mounting economic
and social pressure at home, said in mid-June that he expected the
war to be over before the end of the year. "I think all of us have
learnt our lesson in the Congo," he told reporters in Pretoria,
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Angola, another key player in the DRC conflict, also indicated
its reluctance to a prolonged war in DRC, as it has to "mend its
house".
</P>
<P>
After long talks and bargaining, ministers of countries
involved in the conflict made last-ditch efforts to narrow down
their differences and agreed on the modalities of a ceasefire pact
on July 7 in Lusaka, Zambia, paving the way for the regional
summit which was postponed several times.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the continent, peace is also twisted with Ethiopia
and Eritrea, two neighboring countries in the "Horn of Africa"
deadlocked in a border war.
</P>
<P>
Though both sides have repeatedly claimed that they respect the
11-point framework by the Addis Ababa-based OAU for an immediate
cease-fire and cessation of hostilities, fighting is still off and
on at the border.
</P>
<P>
Angola, which has been suffering over 20 years of civil war, is
still locked in military see-saws.
</P>
<P>
In Somali, Sierra Leone, Comoros and many other parts of the
continent, peace and stability are still nothing more than a dream
for many.
</P>
<P>
Since its birth, the 53-member OAU, which has set its eyes on,
among others, the promotion of unity and solidarity, the defending
of African countries' sovereignty, territorial integrity and
independence, still finds it difficult to promote and preserve
peace and stability in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Actually, OAU has, throughout the decades, set the resolving of
 conflicts in the continent as one of the top enshrined tasks.
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim proposed to establish,
within the organization, a mechanism for conflict prevention,
management and resolution, at the 1993 Cairo summit.
</P>
<P>
Now at the eve of the new millennium, OAU is trying to map out
a blueprint that can help make the organization more influential
and Africa more peaceful.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki to Sign Congo Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki will join other regional heads of state in Zambia on
Saturday for the signing of a cease-fire deal on the war in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a presidential aide said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki would travel to Lusaka on Saturday, spokesman Ronnie
Mamoepa said.
</P>
<P>
He would return home before traveling to Algiers to attend the
Organization of African Unity's (OAU) annual summit.
</P>
<P>
After lengthy talks, a draft cease-fire deal to end the
11-month war in the DRC was reached Wednesday in Lusaka by foreign
and defense ministers from countries involved in the conflict and
DRC rebel representatives.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the agreement, all hostilities should be ended
within 24 hours of the signing of the agreement, all armed groups
in the DRC should be disarmed, and the United Nations (UN)
security council, together with the OAU, should deploy a
peacekeeping force in the country to ensure the implementation of
the deal.
</P>
<P>
It also states that the parties to the conflict will set up a
joint military commission to carry out initial peacekeeping
operations until the deployment of the UN peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said Thursday that he did
not anticipate any problem for the official signing of the
agreement, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"All problems have been thrashed out... we don't expect any
issues that will delay the process further," said Chiluba, who has
been mediating the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire was due to have been signed in Lusaka on June
26, but was delayed by haggling over the details and the political
future of the vast central African country.

<HEADLINE> Employment Up, Wage Increase Down in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Employment in some major service
sectors of Hong Kong resumed growth on a year-on-year basis in
March 1999, while the increase in the wage index in nominal term
remained on a moderating trend.
</P>
<P>
According to the Census and Statistics Department Thursday, the
community, social and personal services sector had a larger
increase in employment, followed by the transport, storage and
communications sector.
</P>
<P>
But employment in the manufacturing sector and employment of
manual workers at construction sites continued to show marked
decrease.
</P>
<P>
Compared with December 1998, employment went up across almost
all the major sectors.
</P>
<P>
Vacancies, however, continued to decrease substantially both
across economic sectors and across occupation categories in March
1999 over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
For all the sectors surveyed taken together, there were around
31,470 vacancies in March 1999, of which 25,040 were in the
private sector and 6,430 in the civil service.
</P>
<P>
Yet compared with December 1998, the picture was more
encouraging, with notable increases in vacancies seen for most of
the major economic sectors and occupation categories.
</P>
<P>
For all the major sectors surveyed taken together, the year-on-
year rate of increase in nominal terms declined from 5.2 percent
in March 1998 to 2.2 percent in September 1998, and further to 0.1
percent in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the companies surveyed reported no change
or a decrease in their average wage rates as compared to a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
After discounting the decrease in consumer prices, the wage
index for all the companies surveyed went up 2.6 percent in real
terms in March 1999 over a year earlier.

HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks dropped 31.14

<P>
The market turnover stood at 9.392 billion HK dollars (1.204
billion U.S. dollars), compared with 16.548 billion HK dollars (2.

</P>
<P>
Traders said the fall resulted from the futures-related trade
and the fear of more placements to cash in on the market.
</P>
<P>
Of the four sub-indices, only Commerce &AMP; Industry registered 0.
74 percent increase, while Finance, Utilities and Properties all
suffered losses of 0.55 percent, 0.12 percent and 0.76 percent

<HEADLINE> Band Leaders Threaten Legal Action over Ceremony Snub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- United States band leaders has
threatened legal action over their dumping from the opening
ceremony although Sydney's Olympic organisers have offered a
compromise deal.
</P>
<P>
Organizing committee chief executive Sandy Hollway on Thursday
met with leaders of the school bands who are angry that initial
plans to have 1,500 foreign students perform at the opening
ceremony were shelved following a public backlash in Australia.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG president Michael Knight announced a compromise deal
earlier this week which would see the children perform at
prominent sites around Sydney during the games, including the
Opera House.
</P>
<P>
But Roy Anthony, the coordinator of the Southern California
school marching bands, says it is unlikely they will accept a
compromise and are considering legal action.
</P>
<P>
The band leaders released a statement ahead of Thursday's
meeting with Hollway, describing Knight as ``harsh and insensitive
'' for his decision.
</P>
<P>
Anthony said the children who were invited last September to
perform at the ceremony had been preparing ever since.
</P>
<P>
"The kids are going to have a hard time accepting that we've
abided by all (SOCOG'S) demands and all their wishes and yet they'
re saying no." Anthony told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
About 1,300 Americans and 200 Japanese marching band members
were booked to play at the opening ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Parliament Enacts Administrative Reform Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Diet (parliament) on Thursday
passed two packages of administrative reform bills aimed at
restructuring the Japanese central government's ministries and
agencies and giving more power to local governments.
</P>
<P>
The bills, which cleared the House of Representatives (lower
house) in June, were approved overwhelmingly at a plenary session
of the House of Councilors, the upper house.
</P>
<P>
The reform laws will take effect in January 2001, while
decentralization laws would be enacted next April.
</P>
<P>
The reform package calls for streamlining the bureaucracy by
reorganizing the country's current 23 central government
institutions into 13 entities through mergers.
</P>
<P>
It is also aimed at strengthening the powers of the prime
minister and other senior government officials by transferring
some power over policy-making to local government authorities.
</P>
<P>
It calls for the establishment of an economic and fiscal policy
council headed by the prime minister to draw up basic policies on
budget formation and fiscal management, which currently fall under
the power of the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, the number of Japan's central government
employees would be cut by 25 percent in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The decentralization package seeks to scrap the current
administrative system in order that the central government can
delegate administrative work to local governments and increase the
power of local authorities to adopt ordinances.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for the merger of local authorities in order to
strengthen their administrative capabilities.

<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- An arts festival to provide
entertainment and education for prisoners and juvenile delinquents
opened today in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
It will offer a series of literary and art activities with
singing contests, theatrical performances and literary exhibits in
prisons and reform schools. At today's opening ceremony there were
20 theater programs, 75 percent of which were the creations of
prisoners and prison officers.
</P>
<P>
It reflects a colorful aspect of prison life in Beijing and is
meant to help reform criminals and their aesthetics, according to
Wang Chongxun, the director of the Beijing Bureau of Prisons. He
explained that, after years of experience, they have learned that
a play, a song, or a poem can arouse a response in a criminal's
heart and cause him to live a new life.
</P>
<P>
One of the prisoners who was both a producer and performer
today, said that the opportunity to perform his own theatrical
programs in prison gave him confidence and a greater determination
to make a new man out of himself.
</P>
<P>
The festival is expected to run through September and the city'
s Bureau of Prisons plans to organize a singing group and
theatrical troupe after it finishes to tour prisons in Beijing and
they may even go public in future to gain more support from the
rest of society, Wang said.

major government-run projects were completed during the just-ended
1998/99 fiscal year ending on July 7.
</P>
<P>
The state-run newspaper Ethiopian Herald Thursday quoted Girma
as saying that the 47 completed projects were among the 253 new
and outstanding projects which were under various stages of
construction throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Among the 253 projects, 177 were carried over from the previous
years and 76 launched during the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, 50 percent of the projects cover
road- building, 13.7 percent transport and communications, 10
percent agriculture, seven percent education and six percent
energy while the rest are related to construction and other
economic sectors.
</P>

The projects, undertaken within the framework of the country's
five-year development program, focus on the improvement and
expansion of infrastructures, Girma said, adding most of the 2.9
billion birr (about 350 million U.S. dollars) allocated for the
year had been utilized for the various phases of activities.
</P>
<P>
Referring to road-building projects which constitute about half
of the project works with a total mileage of close to 2,000

projects."

<HEADLINE> Top Seed Kuerten Stumbles at Swiss Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil
stunned by American Vince Spadea, falling 6-2, 2-6, 7-6 in the
second round of the Swiss Open tennis tournament in Gstaad,
Switzerland, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 29th-ranked Spadea, who lost in the first round on grass at
Nottingham and Wimbledon, found that the return to clay brought a
return to form as he avenged a quarter-final loss to Kuerten at
Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten, the 1997 French Open champion and the winner of clay
court titles in Monte Carlo and Rome this season, lost the first
set without a fight.
</P>
<P>
When the players returned to the court after an hour's rain
delay early in the second set, the 22-year-old Brazilian seemed
finding his form as he won it 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten broke Spadea to open the third but the 24-year-old
American refused to fold and eventually forced the set to a
tiebreak which he won 8-6.
</P>
<P>
Spadea will play 1996 Swiss champion and eighth seed Albert
Costa of Spain, who came rallied to beat Austrian Stefan Koubek 6-
7, 6-1, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Mariano Zabaleta of Argentina won over Frenchman
Cedric Pioline 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 in the rain-delayed first-round game.
</P>
<P>
Fifth seed Felix Mantilla of Spain, the 1997 Swiss champion,
advanced into the second round with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Franco
Squillari of Argentina.

NANCHANG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Jiangxi Province plans to
spend 16 million yuan building a transformer substation next year
in the Lushan Mountain area to put an end to the pollution caused
by burning coal, at Jiujiang on the south bank of the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
The 110-kv station is expected to make Lushan Mountain the
nation's first mountainous scenic spot that will be free from coal
smoke pollution.
</P>
<P>
Lushan Mountain is on UNESCO's world cultural heritage list but
has had a power supply problem for quite a long time and hotels
and people living there have to burn coal, but it is hoped that
the station will give everyone access to electricity.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province will transform the local low-voltage
electric power grids and reduce electricity fees locally to
encourage people to use electricity.

<HEADLINE> Serial Silkworm By-Products Developed in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed
more than 30 kinds of drugs and cosmetics with natural compound
amino acid and other substances extracted from silkworm chrysalis
and excrement, including one drug that can be used to treat
aplastic anaemia.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted the achievements may help reduce the cost of
amino-acid-related products.
</P>
<P>
China produces four-fifths of the world's silk, with about 128,
000 tons of silkworm chrysalis and 400,000 tons of silkworm
excrement discarded each year.
</P>
<P>
Wei Kemin, a professor with the Zhejiang Research Institute of
Traditional Chinese Medicine, and his research team initiated
their study program on recycling of silk industry wastes at the
beginning of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
They successfully separated natural compound amino acid and
some other useful substances from the wastes.
</P>
<P>
The natural compound amino acid, which is much cheaper than
synthetic amino acid, contains 18 types of amino acid needed by
human bodies, according to Wei.
</P>
<P>
Wei estimated their research findings are likely to bring about
a new industry with an annual output value of some two billion
yuan when being popularized alone in Zhejiang Province, a major
silk producer which turns out about 30,000 tons of silkworm
chrysalis and 100,000 tons of silkworm excrement each year.

<HEADLINE> Unprecedented Security Welcomes Sharif Back From U.S., U.K. Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The city of Lahore Thursday
witnessed unprecedented security as Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif returned from his visit to the United States, which evoked
strong criticism at home from the religion-political groups.
</P>
<P>
The special Police Elite Force and officials of the secret
agencies had sealed the Lahore airport and been monitoring all
roads leading to the airport to thwart any attempt of protest
rally before the prime minister's arrival at the capital of Punjab
province, informed sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Entry of the passengers and journalists was banned into the VIP
lounge one and a half hours before the plane carrying the prime
minister touched down. All main gates of the airport were closed
for passengers 30 minutes prior to the plane landing.
</P>
<P>
Sharif arrived at the airport aboard a Pakistani International
Airlines commercial plane at around 10:00 a.m. local time (0500
GMT) and then set out by air to Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
These tight security measures at the Lahore airport caused
great inconvenience to passengers, especially women, children and
the aged people, complained some common passengers, who had to
stand for one hour in scorching heat.
</P>
<P>
When the journalists asked why they were not allowed to enter
the VIP lounge, local police officer Cantt Khalid Sherdil, who had
full control of the security arrangements at the airport, said
that the prime minister had ordered not to allow any reporters to
come close to him.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Prime Minister's Implementation Commission
Rashid Warriach, however, did not agree with Sherdil, saying that
restriction on journalists is a conspiracy against the government.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Sharif
agreed to persuade the Kashmiri Mujahedeen (holy war fighters) to
withdraw from the peaks they occupy in the India-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The deal has aroused anger from most religious parties in
Pakistan and Kashmiri groups, who blamed Sharif for "selling out
the Kashmiris".
</P>
<P>
After the visit to the United States, Sharif went to London and
held talks with his British counterpart Tony Blair on the Kashmir
issue.

<HEADLINE> ECOSOC Adopts Ministerial Communique on Poverty Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic and
Social Council (ECOSC) adopted a ministerial communique here
Wednesday stressing that productive employment played a central
role in poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
The communique, adopted at the high-level segment of the 1999
session of the ECOSOC, said that strategies to eradicate poverty,
promote productive employment and achieve gender equality should
be designed to address the conditions and needs of women and men
on equal and equitable terms.
</P>
<P>
Ministers and heads of delegations also agreed that in many
cases, women and men suffered poverty or became impoverished for
different reasons and through different processes, and faced
different opportunities and constraints in coping with poverty and
in accessing labor markets and sustainable livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
Employment of people, in particular that of women, was a
prerequisite for effective poverty eradication and employment
creation strategies, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The communique called on the international community to support
efforts to eradicate poverty, promote productive employment and
achieve gender equality and encourage members states to adopt and
implement legislation to ensure the elimination of violence
against women.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen people were killed and 50
missing overnight when a torrent of mud came down on the village
of Shaidon in the Leninabad region in northern Tajikistan, the
Interfax news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik Committee for Emergency Situations said the flow of
mud destroyed about 150 residences, a 20-kilometer stretch of road,
15 kilometers of electric power lines and 10 kilometers of
communication lines.

<P>
Search and rescue operations have been launched at the scene
of the disaster, but the efforts were hampered by poor weather.

<P>
HEFEI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The McDonald's Anhui Co., Ltd., a new
subsidiary of the McDonald's Company of the United States, was set
up recently in Hefei, capital of east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The move represents a starting point of a massive program of
McDonald's to expand its business in the central and western parts
of China, said James Chu, vice-president of McDonald's China
Development Co.
</P>
<P>
According to Chu, the fast food giant has been operating 235
restaurants in 41 Chinese cities since it opened its first store
in Shenzhen, the country's first special economic zone in south
China's Guangdong Province. Of these restaurants, the majority are
located in relatively developed eastern and southern areas of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Chu said McDonald's has targeted Anhui because the province has
an increasingly improved business environment and a population of
62 million, a huge potential market.
</P>
<P>
The McDonald's Anhui Co., Ltd. has a total investment of five
million U.S. dollars and has a registered capital of three million
U.S. dollars. It is scheduled to open its first restaurant in
Hefei at the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Europe Might Not Compete in Team Worlds Next Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Europe may not compete in the new
World Team Championship next season, soccer's continental
governing body UEFA said.
</P>
<P>
UEFA president Lennart Johansson said they had only grudgingly
agreed to the first ever tournament in Brazil in January, with the
six confederation winners plus two others to participate. But he
added UEFA could not guarantee the participation of a European
club in any subsequent event.
</P>
<P>
There had been a controversy around Manchester United's
decision to withdraw from FA Cup to play in the FIFA-organized,
eight-team tournament.
</P>
<P>
"We have to listen to our clubs. For this once, we are going
to Brazil out of loyalty to the football family but we cannot
guarantee participation in the future," Johansson was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Johansson, who attended a week-long FIFA meetings in Los
Angeles, said he however sympathized with the position of United.
</P>
<P>
But he denied that UEFA had already lined up Champions League
runners-up Bayern Munich instead of United because it would have
furthered the claims of Germany to be awarded the 2006 World Cup.
UEFA is backing Germany over England for the bid.
</P>
<P>
Johansson said he was "extremely disappointed" over United
decision. "We in UEFA were afraid something like this would
happen because of the overcrowded calendar," he said. "I don't
believe that the participation of either team would have had an
affect on the World Cup vote. What I do think is that we cannot,
in future, force our clubs to take part," he added.

<P>
Tibet is an inalienable part of Chinese territory and Tibetan
affairs are the internal affairs of China and no foreign country
has the right to interfere in them, said Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue at a news conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A small group of U.S. congresspeople have ignored these facts
and put forward the proposal to set up a "World Tibet Day" and
made irresponsible remarks on the Tibet issue in an attempt to use
that issue to interfere in China's internal affairs, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
China is resolutely opposed to this and extremely unhappy about
it, she said, and urged these congresspeople to immediately stop
interfering in China's internal affairs and to stop harming Sino-U.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Carry out Projects for Rural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has planned to implement
thousands of projects for the development of the rural areas in
the new fiscal year, Al-Ahram daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Rural Development Mahmoud Al-Sherif
announced the plans on Wednesday at a press conference, during
which he said the projects are part of the Shrouk scheme aimed at
promoting Egypt's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,900 projects are to be carried out in the fiscal
year 1999-2000 starting on July 1 in the 26 governorates for
infrastructure construction and human development, Al-Sherif said.
</P>
<P>
Facilities will be built relating to drinking water, roads,
electricity, bridges and sanitary drainage systems, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
As regards to human development, projects will be implemented
in the fields of education, health, child and mother care,
cultural centers and youth hostels in addition to small rural
development projects, Al-Sherif added.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated 257.3 million Egyptian pounds
(75.68 million U.S. dollars) for the rural development plans,
including 30 million pounds (8.82 million dollars) for the
construction of new roads.
</P>
<P>
A growing disparity exists between Egypt's rural areas and
urban communities in infrastructures and wealth. The government
has in recent years been exerting efforts to improve the living
conditions in the sparsely-populated countryside through, among
other steps, the Shrouk plan.

<P>
LANZHOU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The city of Dunhuang in China's
Gansu Province has spent nearly 5 million yuan saving a spring in
a desert area, that was drying up because of falling groundwater
levels in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
But now, the area around Yueya Spring, which is at the foot of
Mingsha Hill, has been increased from 0.17 ha. to 0.59 ha. and the
water level in the spring has risen to 1.09 meters from 40 cm
after 12,420 cu.m. of sand were removed.
</P>
<P>
It is still strange that the spring, which is surrounded by
sand dunes, has never been buried, nor has it dried up from a lack
of precipitation.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang, which is famous for its Mogao Grottoes, is one of the
world's leading collections of cave art, and Mingsha Hill, or
Singing Sands, and Yueya Spring are popular tourist attractions.
More than 400,000 tourists visit these sites each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Air Canada reached a deal at the mid-
night deadline with its 5,100 flight attendants on higher pensions
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the negotiators said under the deal flight
attendant at the age of 55 and after 25 years' service might be
paid a yearly pension of 19,200 Canadian dollars (about 13,056 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that Air Canada flight attendants usually
earn a maximum pension of about 22,000 Canadian dollars (about 14,
960 US dollars) a year after 35 years of service. They are paid 18,
000 (about 12,240 US dollars) to 38,500 Canadian dollars (26,180
US dollars) during their career.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the attendants said she was satisfied with
the "end results" of the negotiations, and the two sides would be
back for further discussions. Chief negotiators told a news
briefing that they were pleased business would return to normal.
</P>
<P>
The deal is to a relief of thousands of passengers trapped at
the country's airports, where they either managed to change planes
or sat through the negotiations in the hope of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The progress is also a relief to many of the 7,000 athletes,
coaches and officials from across North and South America, who
could miss the Pan-American Games slated for July 23-August 8 if
Air Canada, the Games' official airline, is grounded.
</P>
<P>
The games will be the largest athletic event ever staged in
Canada.

<HEADLINE> PC Shipments to Mideast to Reach 1 Million Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The total shipments of personal
computers (PCs) to the Middle East and North African markets are
estimated to hit an all-time high of 1 million units in 1999, a
local newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The largest markets for PCs in the region are Egypt, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which account for
two-thirds of all shipments, the Khaleej Times daily quoted
industry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The record-breaking 1 million units of total PC shipments will
represent an important milestone in the development of
information technology (IT) in the Middle East and North African
region, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the Middle East is the second fastest
growing market for IT in the world, after China. The IT market in
this region is estimated at 6.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1999,
compared to 4 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated the IT markets in Gulf countries will increase
to 2.3 billion dollars in 1999 from 1.48 billion dollars in
1997. The total PC market in Gulf countries is expected to reach
415,437 units this year from 266,104 units in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A number of factors have contributed to the growth of the PC
market in the Middle East, industry watchers said.
</P>
<P>
Notable among the factors is the boom in the development of
the Internet and e-commerce and expanding sales in the home
market and education sector.

<HEADLINE> Bankers Review Policies in Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Central bankers and policy makers
from the Asia-Pacific region gathered here Thursday in a regional
central banking conference to discuss regional central banking
policies as well as other economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Koh Yong Guan, managing director of the Monetary Authority of
Singapore, said in his opening address that the conference
provides an excellent opportunity to discuss some of the
challenges that central banks in the region face.
</P>
<P>
He questioned whether central banks should be concerned with
asset prices and how they cope with volatile capital flows during
this time of excessive stock market fluctuations and massive
capital flows.
</P>
<P>
Many central banks have relied on traditional monetary policy
operations, instead of imposing capital controls, to deal with
excessive flows, said Koh.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis has highlighted the importance of sound regulation
and supervision of the financial sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
But how can central banks manage to regulate financial
institutions instead of stifling the growth of the financial
sector remains a tough job, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also asked those at the meeting to discuss the question
whether monetary policy is sufficient for macroeconomic stability.
</P>
<P>
"Prudent monetary policies can achieve low inflation but if
fiscal policies are too expansionary and labor markets are
inflexible, then price stability comes with high interest rates
and high unemployment", he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Fifth Nanyang Asia-Pacific Central Banking Conference,
organized by Nanyang Technological University, will last through
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> PKK Leader Threatens More Attacks If not Spared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- In his latest message of plea and
threat, the convicted Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah
Ocalan warned again that if Turkey does not spare his life, his
PKK militants will escalate attacks on civilian and military
targets in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent out from his prison cell on Imrali Island in
Marmara Sea near western Turkey's province of Bursa, Ocalan
warned he will lose control over the PKK rebels if Turkey does not
accept his "peace offer," the local Daily News reported here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Ocalan's lawyers as saying that Ocalan also
criticized Turkey in the letter for not taking steps toward
recognizing Kurdish rights.
</P>
<P>
In his three-page letter to the head of the prison, Ocalan
complained that little is being done to find a solution to the
Kurdish issue.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone speaks of problems of human rights, democracy and
economy," said Ocalan, "they don't even take tortoise steps toward
a solution, but they rush out to hang me."
</P>
<P>
Since he was captured by Turkish special agents in Kenya in
February, Ocalan has repeatedly said that he will call on his
militants to lay down arms if his life is spared.
</P>
<P>
Despite the "life-for-peace" offer, the Ankara State Security
Court sentenced him to death on June 29 on charges of treason and
separatism.
</P>
<P>
Denying the charges, Ocalan, who led the PKK in its
15-years-old war for Kurdish independence which claimed 37,000
lives, said he had not killed anyone himself.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Developments in Tibetology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China has made some progress in its
research on Tibet since the democratic reforms in the Tibet
Autonomous Region in 1959.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 research institutes, like China's Center of
Tibetology and the China Tibet Academy of Social Sciences, and
some 2,000 faculty members are engaged in Tibetology. They have
completed over 100 research projects and published more than 400
books and 40 different periodicals.
</P>
<P>
Before the democratic reforms of 1959, Tibet's cultural
heritage and relics were on the brink of extinction as artists and
Tibetologists were looked down upon by the local government, but
Tibetology has grown in the past 4 decades among academics in
China and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Tibetology includes Tibetan linguistics and language, history,
philosophy, religion, literature, art, folklore, politics, the
economy, traditional Tibetan medicine, astronomy, geography,
handicrafts, and architecture.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of Karuo relics at Qamdo County that date back 5,
000 years and the Qugong relics from the northern suburb of Lhasa
that are 4,000 years old have provided valuable information for
Tibetology.
</P>
<P>
The popular Tibetan epic "Life of King Gesar," which was handed
down for generations orally by ballad singers, has been made a key
research project at a special institute that is collecting more
than 5,000 cassettes and several hundred video tapes on the epic.
</P>
<P>
This scattered oral tradition is being turned into a systematic,
monumental literary work for the first time and many Tibetan
scholars and Buddhists have acclaimed it as the realization of an
old wish of the Tibetan people.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Expected to Become International Hub of Communications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province is
expected to become an international hub of communications as two
major intercontinental transportation lines to be completed pass
through it, a Chinese expert said here today.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yunfei, a senior engineer with the Shandong Research
Institute of Communications, noted that Shandong will enjoy a
superior advantage when an extended New Eurasia Continental Bridge
crosses the province, which is a north-south line from the Tumen
River Delta in northeast China bordering Russia and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea to Melbourne, Australia.
</P>
<P>
China has started feasibility study several years ago on the
extension of the existing New Eurasia Continental Bridge to the
Republic of Korea, with a vehicle ferry being built connecting
Yantai or Weihai in Shandong with Inchon of the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Both Japan and the Republic of Korea have shown interest in the
idea, and a special forum involving experts from the two nations
and China was held last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, the extension will not only link the west-east
transportation line with the Republic of Korea but also with Japan.
</P>
<P>
The north-south intercontinental line is aimed at linking up
northeast Asia, southeast Asia, and Australia.
</P>
<P>
There have already been some sections completed along the route,
though they are not joined yet.
</P>
<P>
As the economies in these areas progress rapidly, efforts to
link up the sections will be stepped up, Xu said.
