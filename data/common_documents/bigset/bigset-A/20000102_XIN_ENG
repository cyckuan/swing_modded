<HEADLINE> Pakistan Denies Entry of Indian Plane Hijackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Interior Minister
Moinuddin Haider said Saturday that the hijackers of an Indian
airliner and three prisoners freed by India "have not entered
Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is on high alert, and in case they enter Pakistani
territory, they will be apprehended and tried as per established
international rules and conventions, to which Pakistan is a
signatory," he was quoted by the state-run Associated Press of
Pakistan as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a statement by the Indian external affairs
minister claiming that the hijackers and the released prisoners
had entered Pakistan's territory and reached Quetta, capital of
Balochistan province.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Airlines Airbus-300 plane was hijacked on Christmas
eve and the Indian government was forced to free three Kashmiri
militants Friday in exchange for the release of 155 hostages
stranded at the Kandahar airport in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Haider said Pakistan condemns all acts of terrorism and abides
by the international conventions, rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had issued clear and specific instructions to
the concerned officials and agencies of the two provinces
bordering Afghanistan -- North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and
Balochistan.
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances, would these persons be allowed to
enter Pakistan," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"In case they sneak into NWFP or Balochistan, they will be
detained and tried according to law and rules," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf
dismissed Indian allegations that the hijackers of the Indian
plane were Pakistani nationals and called on New Delhi to refrain
from hurling such "baseless" accusations.
</P>
<P>
"Leveling of baseless and false accusations against Pakistan is
part and peculiar element of Indian tactics," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan had made all possible efforts for the safety
and welfare of the innocent hostages on board the hijacked plane.
</P>
<P>
The plane had landed at Pakistan's Lahore airport on December
24 and, at the request of India, the airport authorities provided
fuel and food to the plane before it took off again.

KATHMANDU, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The passenger described by
Indian media as one of the hijackers denounced the baseless
reports about him on his return here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On arriving at the Tribhuvan International Airport, Gajendraman
Tamrakar issued a statement, urging ZEE news net to accept its
mistake and apologize immediately.
</P>
<P>
Some Indian communications media, especially ZEE news had
depicted Tamrakar as one of the five hijackers.
</P>
<P>
Stating that he was very concerned to hear of the pain caused
to his family, friends and the country due to the false reports,
Tamrakar also expressed gratitude to all those expressing concern
and sympathy towards him.
</P>
<P>
The Indian airlines IC-814 aircraft was hijacked to Kandahar of
Afghanistan on its way from Kathmandu to New Delhi by unidentified
people on December 24, 1999. About 160 hostages on board the plane
were released on December 31 after 8 days of negotiations between
the hijackers and the Indian government.

JOHANNESBURG, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African
anti-crime police have arrested three People Against Gangsterism
and Drugs (PAGAD) members who were allegedly linked to incidents
of violence in the Western Cape.
</P>
<P>
The men were not arrested for the recent spate of bombings in
the Western Cape but in connection with other incidents of
violence, police spokesman Sipho Ngwema said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to Ngwema, two other PAGAD members were arrested in
Rylands last Wednesday after police discovered a workshop in which
two cell phones were found in the process of being "modified".
</P>
<P>
The cell phones were "similar" to those used in the Camps Bay
blast on November 28 and the Green Point Christmas Eve blast in
Cape Town, in which seven police officers were wounded, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Accused of Using Toxic Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military on Sunday
accused Chechen rebels of detonating bombs containing toxic
chlorine and ammonia in Grozny, capital of the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had set off several such bombs overnight and early
on Sunday near Russian positions in the east, but that the wind
had blown the green cloud over the rebel- held city center, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported, quoting the press service of the
headquarters of federal forces in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Tass said the troops were equipped for chemical attacks and had
not been affected, but that the cloud could harm the civilians
still trapped in central Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal forces continued massive air strikes on
rebel positions in Grozny and in the southern town of Vedeno, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Despite bad weather, Su-25 attack planes, Su-24 bombers and Mi-
24 combat helicopters have flown about 100 missions against rebel'
s mountain bases and camps, arms depots, mobile communication
stations and strongholds near the villages of Dubai-Yurt, Chishki,
Itum-Kale, Kharachoi, Shalazhi, Orekhovo and Maliye Varandy.
</P>
<P>
Together with border guards, the federal troops continued to
block the rebels' possible routes of retreat to territories
outside Chechnya, including Georgia, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin: Putin to Win Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A top Kremlin official said
Sunday that Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will win the upcoming
presidential race in March.
</P>
<P>
Igor Shabdurasulov, first deputy chief of the presidential
staff, told a press conference that Putin's defeat is impossible,
although the Kremlin must be ready for any outcome of the
balloting, which was moved up by three months following the abrupt
resignation of President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin stepped down Friday, six months ahead of the expiration
of his term, and named Putin the acting president.
</P>
<P>
Shabdurasulov said Putin's potential rivals have no chance of
winning the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"This is very close to the truth," the Interfax news agency
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Putin, who took office as prime minister last August, saw his
approval rate skyrocketing amid a military campaign against rebels
in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The offensive was launched in September following armed Chechen
incursions into neighboring Daghestan and several terrorist
bombings, also blamed on Chechen militants, that killed over 300
people in Moscow and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
Putin, a 47-year old former KGB intelligence officer and
Russian security chief, appeals to popular longing for a strong
leader capable of pulling Russia out of its economic morass and
stamping out widespread corruption.
</P>
<P>
Other presidential hopefuls include former Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov, provincial governor Alexander Lebed, liberal
Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky, and ultra-nationalist Liberal
Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique, No Problems With Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi Saturday confirmed that none of the country's computer
systems went haywire at midnight on December 31.
</P>
<P>
All the computers seemed to have defied what has become known
as the "millennium bug", or the Y2K problem, and continued working
as usual, he said after visiting in the early hours of the New
Year's Day the government' s Computer Problem Technical Unit
(UTY2K), local media reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation was normal in all areas considered
critical by the government, namely, telecommunications, banking,
health, water supply and electricity.
</P>
<P>
However, most businesses closed doors over the new year weekend
and the monitoring will be crucial as they resume work on Monday,
Mocumbi said.
</P>
<P>
Because the older generations of computers used only two digits
to identify years for the sake to save on memory space, it was
feared that computers worldwide would recognize the year 2000 as
1900 and crash when the new year was ushered in.
</P>
<P>
Although information gathered across the globe shows that there
has been no major disruption of computer systems, it will take
days or weeks before anyone can definitively state that the
"millennium bug" is no longer a problem, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Speed Up Land Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
speed up its land reform and re-distribute land equally among
Zimbabweans in the new year as a way to ensure peace in the
country.
</P>
<P>
A few people own vast tracts of fertile land while millions of
others were squashed on poor unproductive land, said Zimbabwean
Vice President Simon Muzenda in his new year statement on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"This state of affairs cannot continue in the new millennium
because there will be no peace without equality in the sharing of
resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
The land issue is very sensitive in Zimbabwe where the black
majority government seeks to compulsorily acquire more than five
million hectares of land from the 4,000 plus white farmers and
distribute it to at least 150,000 peasant farmers.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Muzenda also encouraged all Zimbabweans to
direct their energy toward business innovations and education in
the new millennium.

</P>
<P>
Istanbul lies across Europe and Asia, linking the Balkans, the
Caucasus and the Middle East. Illegal international drug

<HEADLINE> Bank of Israel Governor to Stay on for One More Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli central bank governor
Jacob Frenkel agreed Sunday to stay on his job for another week at
the request of Prime Minister Ehud Barak, said a spokesman of the
Bank of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who left for U.S. Sunday afternoon to attend the second
round of peace talks with Syria and may not be back in some days,
told the outgoing governor earlier that his successor will be named
by the end of this week, according to a statement issued by the
bank.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel, due to resign on Sunday night, agreed to extend his
term of office to January 9.
</P>
<P>
Having told Barak about his plan to leave the post last summer,
Frenkel announced his resignation on November 15, 1999 after eight
and a half years in the governor's chair.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that he will take senior posts in some
international financial organizations or launch his private
business after leaving his office.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Barak has been trying to find somebody to replace
Frenkel and at the same time to maintain the same monetary policy
taken by the central bank in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, Professor Elhanan Helfman, Barak's favorite candidate
for the post, decided not to leave the hallowed halls of academia.
</P>
<P>
The leading candidates now are David Klein, currently the No.2
at the central bank, Professors Avi Ben-Bassat, Avishai Broverman,
Leo Leiderman, Dr. Liora Meridor and David Brodet.
</P>
<P>
The top post at the Bank of Israel is regarded as the most
critical position in the country's economy because of its unique
combination of influence and independence, which requires a person
of high regard and great professional expertise.
</P>
<P>
Barak reiterated Sunday that Israel needs an independent central
bank to strengthen economic stability, to continue opening
financial markets to competition and to integrate Israel with the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent uncertainty about Frenkel's successor, there
are no signs of unease in Israel's financial markets on the eve of
his departure.

ISLAMABAD -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar Sunday

proceedings under international law if they came to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Under the international laws dealing with hijacking, we will
arrest them and put them before the court," he told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
However, he categorically affirmed that the hijackers have not
entered the country. "I can say with full responsibility that the
hijackers have not entered Pakistan," he said.

Five hijackers seized the Indian jet on the Christmas eve and
freed the 155 hostages on board the plane, which had been grounded

exchange for the release of three Kashmiri militants from Indian
jails. (Pakistan-Hijackers)

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- At Least 10 senior officers of
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga's elite security guard
are to be questioned following last month's bomb attack in which
she narrowly escaped assassination but had her right eye injured,
media sources here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said an interim report by Deputy Inspector-General
of Police Indra De Silva had wanted 10 senior members of the
Presidential Security Division questioned.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attack took place on December 18 when a female suicide
bomber, suspected to be a Tamil rebel, made an attempt on the life
of the president during her last election campaign rally. At least
24 people were killed and more than 110 others injured in the
blast.
</P>
<P>
"A suicide bomber could strike anywhere, but then there is the
security to try and prevent it. In this case there was a serious
breach of security and there are people who should be held
responsible," De Silva was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that action would be taken against those responsible
for the security lapse, but gave no details.

CANBERRA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Hopman Cup
veterans Wayne Ferreira and Amanda Coetzer disposed of tournament
debutant Belgium in their first round match of the mixed teams
tournament in Perth, the Western Australian state, on Sunday.

<P>
Coetzer, playing her eighth Hopman Cup, gave South Africa a

<HEADLINE> Nearly 1,300 People Die of Malaria in Bangladesh in  3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 1,283 people have died of
malaria in the last three years in 13 most malaria-vulnerable
districts of Bangladesh, while 187,000 people in the country have
been affected during the period, the official BSS news agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting sources at the Health Directorate, the news agency said
that from January 1997 to November 1999, about 187,000 people were
affected by the disease across the country, and 180,000 of them
were inhabitants of 13 border and hill districts.
</P>
<P>
About 10 million people of the hill and border districts in
southeastern and northern Bangladesh have been living with the
risk of catching this malignant disease, the BSS said.
</P>
<P>
Following the malaria disaster in the districts, the Health
Directorate has taken a pilot project to check the death toll and
get rid of massive malaria fever.
</P>
<P>
As part of the initial step of the two-year project, a two-day
workshop on "Malaria Prevention Strategy at District Level," the
first of its kind in the country, was held late December to fix
the operational strategy for removing malaria from the country,
especially from the unprotected areas.
</P>
<P>
The project, sponsored by the World Health Organization, would
be formally launched in February, Director General of the Health
Directorate Professor Ahsan Ullah was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If the project was implemented, the death toll due to malaria
would be reduced significantly and risk of malaria would also be
eliminated among the people of these 13 districts," he said.

in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
-- Now that the Year 2000 has arrived around the world without
significant disruptions of power, transportation, commerce and
other activities dependent on computers, the question arises: Was
the threat of technology failure overstated, or did spending
hundreds of billions of dollars to fix things avert a catastrophe?

<HEADLINE> Barak Flies to U.S. for Peace Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak left here Sunday for the United States to attend the second-
round peace talks with Syria, officials in the Barak's office said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Barak held closed-door cabinet meetings to brief his
ministers on the upcoming talks, but the planned security cabinet
meeting was cancelled because of the tight schedule. Barak also met
representatives of National Council for the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Israel Radio Sunday morning, Barak emphasized that
the agreement with Syria will include painful peace prices.
However, he said, the aim that he goes to the U.S. is for talks to
strengthen the State of Israel and to guarantee a better future for
Israeli children.
</P>
<P>
Barak's entourage included Foreign Minister David Levy, Tourism
Minister and former Chief of General Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein, Chief of General Staff Shaul
Mofaz, National Security Adviser Danny Yatom and head of the
negotiation team Uri Saguy.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation team is expected to be divided into four working
teams for security arrangement, borders, water and normalization.
</P>
<P>
According to Barak's spokesman Gadi Baltiansky, Barak wants to
focus first on security and normalization issues and push the
thorny discussions of borders and water to the end of agenda.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear whether this order of topics is acceptable to the
Syrians.
</P>
<P>
The talks are scheduled to begin Monday at a hotel on the banks
of the Potomac River in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, a two-hour
drive or 20-minute helicopter ride from Washington and close enough
to allow maximum involvement of U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Because of the media blackout by U.S. demands, little is known
about the agenda of the talks. However, it is expected to last for
10 days or two weeks, while Barak will not stay for the duration
and Levy is expected to stay throughout.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Prime Minister's office said the talks are to
begin with a modest ceremony and continue with meetings between
President Clinton and Barak or Levy, and Albright and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa on the other. At these meetings,
the leaders are to discuss the agenda for the talks and set a
working schedule.
</P>
<P>
Barak and al-Sharaa resumed Israeli-Syrian peace talks in
Washington on December 15 after a freeze of nearly four years.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Continue Peace Talks With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Sunday that it will continue to pursue peace talks with rebel
groups in the new year but will reject their pro-independence
demand.
</P>
<P>
In statement released here, National Security Adviser Alexander
Aguirre said the government is ready to stretch its patience, but
added this will not be at the expense of the national integration.
</P>
<P>
"We will stretch our patience for the sake of peace. But we
will not tolerate either the continued violation of our laws by
these groups," Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
The government is presently conducting peace talks with the
secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and with
National Democratic Front (NDF) at the local level.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said the government remains hopeful that the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) will continue to help
facilitate the peace process between the government and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
"If the Islamic countries will be helping us, we encourage them
to help by persuading or influencing the MILF that it is better to
stop fighting but go on with development to uplift the conditions
of our Muslim brothers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That's the only way we can do it, by really stopping fighting
and be within the autonomy and within the framework of our
constitution," he said.
</P>
<P>
The same policy goes for the NDF, but the government will not
tolerate extortion, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to talk peace. But when worse comes to worst, we have
to defend our republic," Aguirre said.

<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- It is only four days ago that British Prime Minister Tony
Blair made a speech in his constituency urging people to make
Britain "a beacon to the world in the 21st century." But as the
country nursed its New Year hangover, there was a growing
suspicion that Britain had been outshone.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Across the country Britain welcomed the new Millennium with
fireworks, good humor and an abundance of drinking and dancing.
Most British police forces had canceled all leave over the holiday,
but they reported fewer arrests than on a "normal" New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
The Independent on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- The Year 2000 computer bug failed to bite on New Year's Day,
leaving experts around the world sitting on their hands with
little to do, or congratulating themselves on 500 billion U.S.
dollars -- the global cost of Y2K readiness -- well spent.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- British Millennium organizers Saturday night claimed that a
series of bomb threats on millennium eve were to blame for much of
the disruption that caused delays and transport problems.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain and the European Union will do all they can to
support peace agreements Israel reaches with the Palestinians and
Syrians, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in an article
carried by Sunday's Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- As Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak focuses this week on the
Israeli-Syrian track of peace talks, talks between Israel and the
Palestinians have faltered and may regain momentum only after
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's visit to the United States later
this month.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak and the Israeli negotiation team are to leave for the
U.S. Sunday afternoon for the resumed peace talks with Syria slated
for Monday in Shepherdstown, West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to last for about 10 days. However,

week.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic News Brief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- An Iraqi Airline official source said the airways' 20
staff members have gone to Malaysia for a 3-month training course
at the Malaysian Air Academy to get commercial pilot licence.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the members will then join another 3-month
training course on Airbus jets in the same country for higher
qualification in Airbus-320 piloting.
</P>
<P>
A French Airline delegation visited Baghdad late September and
agreed with Iraqi Airline officials on providing advanced training
schemes to the Iraqi staff in Jordan and some other countries
immediately after lifting the United Nations ban on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iranian Oil Minister Bigan Namdar Zanganeh said the
gas pipeline between Iran and Turkey would operate as of January
2000.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh said a relevant deal would be concluded soon with
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh expected that Iran's oil revenues would rise 2 billion
U.S. dollars in light of the global oil price hike.
</P>
<P>
Iran's new fiscal year starting March expects 11.8 billion
dollars in oil revenues on a 13.8-dollar per barrel base.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- A Jordanian Technical mission is to head for Baghdad,
Iraq, this week to discuss the details of a bilateral oil deal for
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Sources with Jordan's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources
said the deal was meant to secure Jordan's oil needs in 2000 from
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The sources said difference over price led to a failure of
reaching bilateral agreement during Jordanian Foreign Minister
Abdel Ilah al-Khatib's visit to Baghdad a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Amman refused Iraq's 19-dollar per barrel offer and recommended
a 15 dollar compromise. The row has not been settled yet.
</P>
<P>
Jordan would pay 100 million dollars more this year if Iraq
insisted on a minimum 19-dollar per barrel, which would hit hard
the country's already strained budget, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Chairman of Chamber of Aegean Region Industrialists,
Atil Akkan, said that they aim to make Izmir, the third largest
city of Turkey, and the Aegean region the center of the country's
foreign investment in 2000, reported Turkish Daily News on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"For 2000, we plan to pull about 1 billion dollars of foreign
investments into the region. We shall also support and build a
service center to assist in cooperation between Turkish and
overseas companies," Akkan pledged.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rate Up to 3.13 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate rose
past the 3 percent mark for the week ended on December 18, 1999
and stood at 3.13 percent following a sharp increase in prices of
non-food articles.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve bank of India, the 0.29 percentage
points spurt in the annual inflation rate to 3.13 percent as
against 2.84 percent in the previous week was mainly on account of
a 1.4 percent rise in prices of non-food articles prices under the
Primary Articles Category
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate was much higher at 5.91 percent
during the corresponding period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The lower rate of inflation during the most part of 1999 was
mainly on account of a comparison with a higher base in 1998 when
overall prices were up following an abnormal increases in
vegetable prices.

<P>
DHAKA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Customers are few in number in the
gold market in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka although Eid-ul-
Fitr, the most important festival in the country, comes in less
than 10 days,The Financial Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sellers in Baitul Mukarram Jewelry market and Chandni market,
the two big gold markets in the city, said the customers' turnout
normally grew after the 15th of Ramadan every year, but this year
the turnout is smaller than that of the corresponding period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The owner of a jewelry shop was quoted as saying that people
are gradually losing their confidence in locally-made jewelry
items because of the section of unscrupulous merchants.
</P>
<P>
People mostly from middle- and low-income groups do not feel
secure to come out wearing gold jewelry, for fear of muggers and
snatchers, is another reason behind the decline of customers'
turnout.
</P>
<P>
A good number of goldsmiths said there is no substantial order
now other than the usual ones in the goldsmith shops, although two-
thirds of the month of the Ramadan were passing off.
</P>
<P>
Some goldsmiths said the abrupt price hike of gold two months
ago was part of the reason for the decline of customers' turnout
in the gold shops, in addition to the poor economic conditions of
the low-income groups and their fear of muggers and snatchers.

<HEADLINE> Crucial Y2K Test Yet to Come to Thailand: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Though Thailand rolled over into
the new millennium smoothly on Saturday without any major Y2K
computer problem, an expert has warned that the real test for the
country's immunity has yet to come.
</P>
<P>
Thaweesak Kor-anantakul, director of the National Electronics
and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC), was quoted by Sunday's
Bangkok Post as saying that only 20 percent of the country's
computer systems were turned on when Thailand passed into the new
century.
</P>
<P>
Whether Thailand was really safe from the millennium bug would
be more accurately gauged on January 4, the first working day of
the new year, when the rest 80 percent of the country's computers
will be turned on, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the National Y2K Command Center will be running
fully on January 4 to monitor the situation and make sure the Thai
system is really safe.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K command center is operating at a cost of eight million
baht(212,000 U.S. dollars) to monitor software problems during the
transition of the new year, the Bangkok Post said.
</P>
<P>
The government and the state enterprises have spent 1.4 billion
baht (37.1 million dollars) to update their computer systems to
prevent a Y2K glitch while the private sector's investment was
estimated at 20 billion baht (530 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Y2K command center received 240 reports on problems related
to transport and telecommunications, power, energy and water
between 10 p.m. (1500 GMT) Friday and 3 a.m. (2000 GMT) Saturday.
But none of the problems was caused by the Y2K bug.

Myanmar experienced a sharp drop of foreign investment year by
year. According to the official figures, the country received 2.3
billion dollars of the investment in 1997 and 248 million dollars
in 1998.

According to official statistics, since Myanmar opened to
foreign investment in late 1988, the country had drawn from 24
countries and regions a total of 7.101 billion dollars of the
investment in 317 projects as of the end of July 1999.

countries most likely to face chaos because of the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
"I dare say to all Indonesian people that we have passed such
critical condition of the Y2K in the prone sectors, but the
command posts will keep on observing it," Agum was quoted by the
Antara News Agency Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the sector of electricity, he said that no power-generating
plant in the country faced obstacle, neither did the facilities
and satellites in the sector of telecommunication.
</P>
<P>
As for the transportation sector, especially the operation of
the flights, it could be said that everything was safe, according
to Agum. The oil and gas sector was also reported to be obstacle-
free, as supply depots and centers were operating well.
</P>
<P>
He said that the financial and banking sector is also working
in a normal way.
</P>
<P>
"We should thank God for the obstacle-free condition, as this
could be important for foreign investments to flow to Indonesia,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Agum asked the command posts to continue observing the
development of problems within a week in order to know the impact
resulting from the change of the century.

BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- All major Beijing-based
newspapers front-paged Chinese President Jiang Zemin's speech at a
New Tear tea party hosted Saturday by the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader reiterated that the "One China" principle is
the foundation and prerequisite of peaceful reunification of the
motherland, while extending New Year's greetings to the whole
nation.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the major achievements China made in 1999, Jiang
urged all people of the country, under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China, to get a clear understanding of the
situation, recognize the tasks ahead, seize the opportunities, and
blaze a new trail and keep forging ahead, be confident, be united
and work hard in the country's socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that China adheres to the principles of peaceful
reunification and "one country, two systems," and the eight-point
proposal he put forward five years ago regarding expanding
relations across the Taiwan Straits and promoting the process of a
peaceful reunification remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"We will take into consideration the different characteristics
of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and Taiwan will be given plenty of
flexibility to realize peaceful reunification of China under the '
one country, two systems' principle," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Other front-page stories of the major Beijing-based newspapers
include reports on the first day of the new millennium and on
China's foreign exchange reserves reaching 154.675 billion U.S.
dollars by December 31, 1999, and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
paying a millennial tribute to the nation's newest and biggest set
of bells, the Bell of Harmony.

ROME, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Josephat Kiprono held off
the cold weather and cobble stones of the Italian capital to win
the title of the Rome Millennium Marathon here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kiprono clocked a outstanding winning time of two hours eight
minutes and 27 seconds, cutting almost a minutes from the listed
course record.
</P>
<P>
Kiprone surged ahead three kilometers from the finish line
from close local rival Giacomo Leone and captured his second big
city marathon victory inside four months.
</P>
<P>
Kiprono notched up his personal best of 2:06:44, the fourth
fastest time, when winning the Berlin Marathon in September, and
said that he might have approached that time in better weather
conditions and on a smooth road surface.
</P>
<P>
Leone was second in a personal best 2:08:41.

Kenya scored a double victory with Tegla Loroupe taking the
women's honors in 2:32:04.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 1 (Xinhua) -- After the 62-year-old
Mexican Carmen Alicia Muniz breaking her own record of cycling of
pedalling for 26 straight hours, she was hospitalized with fatigue
on Saturday
</P>
<P>
The former Olympic cyclist for Mexico in the 1950s, '60s and '
70s, was in stable condition after her record effort to keeping
riding at a speed of least 20km per hour, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Her previous record was listed in the Guinness Book of Records.
</P>
<P>
"I feel happy and content and I knew I would set a record,never
thinking about stopping even though I started feeling bad about
three in the morning," Muniz told reporters before being taken to
hospital.
</P>
<P>
The record was set at a velodrome constructed for the 1968
Mexico City Olympics, a popular site for cyclists attempting to
set records because of the city's altitude of nearly 2,240 meters.
Less air density at such altitudes lowers wind resistance.
</P>
<P>
Muniz covered some 572 km in 26 hours, averaging 22.02 km/h on
1,717 circuits around the 333.33-meter oval.
</P>
<P>
Muniz previously set the Guinness record on June 20, 1997, by
pedalling for 24 hours.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Cabinet Adopts Plan for Fighting Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian cabinet on Sunday night
approved a 10-year plan for fighting air pollution in the capital
city of Tehran following a pollution monitoring committee's warning
of increasing pollution in the city.
</P>
<P>
The pollution control plan, which will take effect immediately
after being adopted, has seven sections each with its own relative
priority, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It also outlines such anti-pollution measures as the junking of
very old vehicles and rehabilitation of public transport systems.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Mayor Morteza Alviri announced last month that a 15-year
project will be launched to curb the serious air pollution in the
city next year.
</P>
<P>
The project will combine three plans which were worked out by
the World Bank, Japanese experts and Iranian environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 1.5 million tons of pollutants are being
produced in Tehran annually, a problem to be addressed in the first
year of the implementation of the said project.
</P>
<P>
The Supervisory and Coordinating Committee for Emergence Air
Pollution in Tehran announced on Sunday that air pollution in
Tehran will increase in the coming few days due to air stagnation
and inversion.
</P>
<P>
The committee said that the level of air pollution of carbon
monoxide in northern part of the city was 1.7 times higher than the
permitted level on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, traffic policemen on Sunday distributed leaflets to
drivers calling on them to use their private cars in even and odd
days according to the number of their car plates.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution in the Iranian capital city passed "danger" level
in the past weeks, even "critical" level in several days, due to
air stagnation. Health and environmental authorities have urged
residents not to travel in the city in their personal cars and
advised them to take public transportation instead.
</P>
<P>
Over two million old vehicles which consume fuel above the
standard are the main contributor of about 80 percent of air
pollution in Tehran.

<P>
OTTAWA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the world are still in
a" critical phase" to dodge the Y2K bullet despite its failure to
hit any major targets on New Year's Day, the Canadian government
warned Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We feel relieved, but we are really conscious that it is not
over," said Treasury Board President Lucienne Robillard, the
minister responsible for Canada's Y2K readiness.
</P>
<P>
The warning came hours before the country is to hold its breath
again with industry and financial markets gearing up Sunday night
for a return to work.
</P>
<P>
People can breathe more easily if the next week passes without
any major crises, Robillard said.
</P>
<P>
Canada has spent 2.5 billion Canadian dollars (about 1.7
billion U.S. dollars) in deflecting the Y2K problems. So far there
has been no report of any millenium-related bugs in the country.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- An anti-poaching team of the
Kenya Wildlife Service Saturday killed four elephant poachers in
the northeastern part of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The poachers had killed eight elephants in the Kora National
Park but were caught burying the ivory which they planned to
recover later, local officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The poachers, armed with three automatic rifles, exchanged fire
with the game wardens before they were killed.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has banned all hunting of wild game and is opposed to a
recent decision by the world community to lift partially the ban
on ivory trade, saying that even a limited lifting of the ivory
ban will increase illegal poaching of Africa's elephants.

"The site is totally independent of any other Lloyd's system so
there is no way it can affect any systems that are running actual
insurance transactions," she added.

Meanwhile, London's top City firms have begun testing their

<HEADLINE> Turkey Eager to Strike Deal on Natural Gas with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Turkish Pipeline
Company (BOTAS) Gokhan Yardim said on Sunday that he will go to
Tehran to conduct talks about a Turkish-Iranian natural gas deal.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Turkish Daily News, the BOTAS boss
disclosed that his meetings, duo to start on January 10, will be
conducted within the framework of a protocol earlier presented by
Ankara to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"We announced to Tehran that we wanted to buy natural gas by
2001, but they informed us that they would be able to sell us
natural gas within two weeks," Yardim said.
</P>
<P>
He added that it seems to him that preparations are still needed
as pipeline stations are yet to be completed although pipeline
itself appears ready.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Iran reached an agreement in 1977 on the sale of 10
billion cubic meters of Iranian natural gas through a pipeline to
be built between the two neighbors. The two sides decided that the
gas sale should start by January 1, 1999. Otherwise, Turkey would
have to pay for the cost of the gas due to a take-or-pay agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, the reservations put forward by the United States
delayed the construction of the Turkish section of the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Due to the Iranian and Libyan Sanctions Act (ILSA), enacted by
the U.S.Congress, Turkish-Iranian natural gas was in the U.S.
government's spotlight. Later, the U.S. softened its opposition to
the Turkish-Iranian deal.
</P>
<P>
Ankara and Tehran then quietly resumed efforts to pursue
construction of the pipeline. But a delay was an established fact.
</P>
<P>
Yadim said that the Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources sent a letter to the Iranians requesting postponement of
the project deadline to 2001 and the Iranians replied that they
would not insist on the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is poor in the deposits of petroleum and natural gas.
Russia now is the main supplier of the energy to Turkey, which has
tried to diversify the sources under a new energy policy.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Leaves for Washington for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa left here Sunday for Washington to take part in the
second round of peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and members of the U.S. Committee on the Middle East peace
process will attend the first session of the talks to be held in
Shepherdstown, West Virginia Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa was accompanied by a number of advisors and specialists
in the various elements of peace, the Arab Syrian News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel resumed their talks in Washington on December
15-16 after nearly four years of suspension.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday Sharaa said in Cairo that the second round of
Syrian-Israeli talks will be crucial and will uncover the real
intentions and seriousness of the Israeli side on the peace process
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Syria heads for the peace talks with "an open heart and firm
will" to achieve just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the
Middle East, Damascus Radio said in a political commentary Sunday.
</P>
<P>
For Syria, peace means the restoration of all its territories
and national rights, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's commitment to the full withdrawal from the Golan
Heights which it captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war will
pave the way for peace-making on all the other tracks of peace with
Israel, said the radio while stressing the integration of peace
talks on the Lebanese and the Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
The radio cited statements made by Syrian and Lebanese leaders
that they will not sign peace deal with Israel unilaterally, but
will back the efforts to establish a fair and comprehensive peace
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said before leaving
for Washington on Sunday that he expects the coming U.S.-brokered
talks with Syria to be difficult.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel will stick to its security conditions and
establish peace at any price.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy also said that everybody
knows that the talks with Syria are very delicate and difficult.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the talks includes the water issue, the situation
in Lebanon, the security arrangements and the future Arab-Israeli
ties, Levy added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- President of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan on Sunday welcomed
the recent efforts by Qatar and Bahrain to solve their border
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Zayed expressed his satisfaction with a recent decision made by
the two countries to solve their border dispute amicably, the
official WAM news agency quoted UAE Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed al-Nahyan as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zayed made the remarks while meeting with visiting Qatari Emir
Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani late Sunday, WAM said, adding
that the Qatari emir, who arrived in the evening, has ended his
brief visit and left the country for home.
</P>
<P>
The president described the agreement between Qatar and Bahrain
as a step forward in boosting cordial ties and mutual confidence
and will deepen fraternal bonds between them, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He said Zayed also called on Arab countries to follow the same
path of concord, cooperation and solidarity to enhance inter-Arab
relations.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the emirs of Qatar and Bahrain agreed to set up
a joint committee chaired by the crown princes of the two countries
to settle their territorial dispute amicably. The agreement was
reached at the end of a visit by the Qatari emir to Manama.
</P>
<P>
The dispute focuses on Doha's claim to the Hawar islands and
Fasht Al-Dibel rocks, which are potentially rich in oil and gas
reserves, but have been held by Bahrain since the 1930s, and
Manama's claim to Zubara on Qatar's coast that is under Doha's
control.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Bahrain also decided to exchange ambassadors and the
Qatari Airways will operate flights between Manama and Doha under
the agreement.
