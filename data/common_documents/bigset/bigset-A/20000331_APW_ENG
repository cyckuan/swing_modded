Volcano Erupts in Northern Japan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- The Mount Usu volcano erupted Friday, spewing hot rock,
gas and a plume of ash and smoke over the snowy countryside of Japan's
northernmost main island. There were no immediate reports of injury. Experts
monitoring seismic activity had predicted the eruption, and had already
evacuated more than 11,000 residents from homes at its base. Roughly 51,000
people live in this town and two others near the 2,416-foot mountain, 475 miles
north of Tokyo.

Elian Dad's Visa Attempt Hits Snag
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father asked for a visa Thursday to come to
the United States and take the boy back to Cuba. The attempt hit a procedural
snag, however, when the State Department told the father's lawyer that
applications must be submitted to the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana.
Discussions between immigration officials and the boy's Miami relatives,
meanwhile, ended without a resolution. The talks were set to resume Monday. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service had warned that it would revoke Elian's
right to stay in the United States unless the relatives promised to turn him
over if their legal appeals were rejected. But after Thursday's meeting, the INS
pushed back the deadline for a second time to at least Tuesday.

FTC Investigates Yahoo! Practices
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission is investigating
Internet powerhouse Yahoo! Inc. to see whether its consumer information
practices violate federal regulations. The Santa Clara-based company has been
asked to turn over documents to determine if it complied with the FTC's consumer
protection regulation against the use and disclosure of user data, Yahoo!
revealed in its annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission on Thursday. The investigation also includes Yahoo!'s acquisition
last year of GeoCities, which helps people set up their own Web sites, the
company said.

U.N. Targeting Money Laundering
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands (AP) -- The United Nations launched a drive
Thursday to enlist secretive offshore havens in the struggle against money
laundering -- appropriately, at a conference set on a tiny island that is the
world's fifth-largest banking center. ''The amounts involved in these financial
scandals have gone beyond what the world community is prepared to tolerate,''
said Pino Arlacchi, a U.N. undersecretary general and executive director of the
Vienna-based U.N. Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention. The two-day
conference was aimed at getting offshore havens to adhere to a set of banking
regulations laid out by the Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development.

House Approves $13 Billion Measure
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved a $13 billion measure Thursday for the
Pentagon, Colombia and recovery from Hurricane Floyd after refusing to threaten
European allies with a pullout of U.S. peacekeepers from Kosovo. The Senate
Appropriations Committee plans to write a roughly $6 billion version of the bill
next week, despite long-running opposition by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss. But Lott is under growing pressure to reverse himself. The legislation
provides money for popular causes like American soldiers and drug-fighting
overseas and road-building, natural disaster recovery and farmers at home.

Congo Limits Tribunal's Power
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- A military tribunal that has passed hundreds of death
sentences will no longer have blanket authority to try civilians, Congo's
president said following condemnations of the court by the United Nations and
human rights groups. The government is also setting up a committee to review the
court's convictions, according to a statement from President Laurent Kabila. The
tribunal, known as the Military Court of Order, was set up by Kabila to handle
discipline problems within the army after he seized power in 1997. But it has
slowly extended its jurisdiction to non-army matters.

Nets Defeat Raptors 107-103

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- A foolish technical foul and an unfortunate
encounter with a rookie ruined Vince Carter's 39-point night, and the Toronto
Raptors lost for the fifth time in six games, 107-103 to the New Jersey Nets on
Thursday night. Carter picked up a technical for halfheartedly throwing the ball
at Scott Burrell after a hard foul with 3:31 left, then had his shot blocked by
rookie Evan Eschmeyer with 35 seconds left. The Nets kept their slim playoff
hopes alive as they pulled within 4{ games of idle Orlando for the final playoff
spot in the East.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Every weekday morning, as the streets of
downtown Nairobi begin to fill with people heading to work, Pius
Muiru brings miracles to the Odeon cinema.
</P>
<P>
   His voice fills the crumbling theater, booming through
loudspeakers across cracked leather seats jammed with worshippers.
It rolls out into the lobby and past the grimy candy counter, where
still more people press their heads against the walls, trying to
get just a little bit closer.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where more than half the working age population can't
find jobs, where hundreds of thousands live without electricity or
piped water and where few can afford quality medical care, Muiru
and his church, the Maximum Miracle Center, bring hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the power of miracles!'' he yells into his cordless
microphone, sweat beading on his face as he lays his hands on a
woman complaining of stomach problems. ''I reject the power of
Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   She collapses back into the arms of the ecstatic crowd then
stands to wave her hands in thanks. For a moment, at least, her
pain is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Africans are turning to Christianity in ever-increasing numbers.
With a yearly growth rate estimated at 3.5 percent, Christianity is
growing more quickly in Africa than in any other part of the world.
And increasingly, Africans -- disillusioned by their governments and
their politicians, and burdened by poverty and AIDS -- are finding
their God in independent churches like Muiru's.
</P>
<P>
   Distanced from missionaries, autonomous of large Western-based
churches and often combining African traditions with Christian
rites, these churches have swept the continent. Some are tiny
storefront operations, others movements with millions of followers.
</P>
<P>
   The range of beliefs and practices, all within Christianity, is
staggering; from the Zion Christian Church in South Africa to the
Winners Chapel in Nigeria, from urban churches focused on material
success to those with prophets in tiny villages.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the churches go back to the early part of the 20th
century, but experts have seen a surge in recent years -- and today
they number more than 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   African Christian churches ''are putting it together as someone
would with great improvisational jazz,'' said Thomas E. Blakely, an
anthropologist at Pennsylvania State University and an authority on
the continent's religions. ''They're making it up as they go
along.''
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of some established Christian churches are worried
about the spread of the independents. They fear a loss of members
and a climate they worry is increasingly friendly to religious
charlatans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a challenge,'' said Clement Janda, secretary general of
the All African Conference of Churches. ''There is a concern about
this happening.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, fears of the most extreme fringe churches have
increased, fed by the deaths of hundreds of members of a doomsday
Christian sect, the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten
Commandments of God, in the lush mountains of southwestern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   While only a minuscule percentage of churches veer into
violence, the turmoil that can feed the growth of new churches can,
in extreme cases, give rise to cults.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, when the Ten Commandments sect was born,
Uganda was just emerging from years of anarchy, the economy was in
shambles and AIDS was killing people by the thousands. Desperate
for answers, the movements' followers found it in extremism.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are poor and seek some relief in these sects, because
the established churches do not offer in-depth attention to their
physical problems,'' said the Rev. Stefano Kaombwe, secretary to
the head of the Roman Catholic church in Tanzania. ''What happened
in Uganda could also happen in Tanzania. There is nothing to
prevent a similar tragedy from occurring here.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of independent churches, though, say they have nothing
in common with the Uganda cult, that their free-form Christianity
not only spreads the Bible, but also offers hope, and perhaps some
answers, to the specific problems facing their members.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are addressing the social issues, family upheavals and such
things,'' Muiru said after his service, in which dozens of people
came forward to be healed. ''What we're revealing to these people
is that anything can happen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Upheaval often feeds the ranks of the independent churches.
</P>
<P>
   Nairobi, for instance, saw strong growth in such churches after
political violence shook Kenya in 1991 in the lead-up to multiparty
elections. In Nigeria, 15 years of military rule that culminated in
the brutal, corrupt regime of Gen. Sani Abacha, gave birth to
hundreds of street-corner houses of worship.
</P>
<P>
   But few of these churches get involved in politics.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the more established Christian churches in Africa
have taken strong political stances in support of human rights and
against oppressive regimes, most of the independent churches have
remained silent. Their concerns are often more basic, offering
their followers a way to cope with daily issues: Will I get a job?
How can I feed my family? How can I be cured of my pains?
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not about politics,'' said Muiru's wife, Lucy, who
often preaches before her husband takes the stage at the Odeon.
''We are about Jesus.''

<HEADLINE> Suns' Johnson Delays Comeback  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Kevin Johnson's return to the NBA is still on
hold.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson sat out the Phoenix Suns' win over the Atlanta Hawks on
Thursday with a groin injury and said he will miss the team's next
game, at Detroit on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just part of getting in shape,'' Johnson, who has been
out of the league for two years, said after Phoenix routed Atlanta
118-74. ''I want to make sure I can really contribute. We have
things clicking right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 34, said he hopes to practice Saturday. Phoenix plays
at Minnesota on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix signed Johnson, the club's career assists leader, to a
$165,000 contract March 25, a day after Jason Kidd broke his ankle
in a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns are 2-2 since losing Kidd, who was averaging a
league-high 10.1 assists.

<HEADLINE> It's official: Legislature cries 'uncle' on timely budget  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State legislators have approved an emergency
state government spending bill, officially signaling another year
without an on-time budget in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.4 billion emergency appropriations measure approved
Thursday keeps state government afloat between Saturday, when the
2000-01 fiscal year begins, and April 16.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 16th straight year that lawmakers and the governor
have failed to approve a new budget prior to the start of a new
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Though some legislators -- chiefly Assembly Republicans who are
in the minority -- grumbled about another budget failure, both
chambers overwhelmingly approved the emergency spending legislation
before adjourning for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, lawmakers approved nine emergency spending bills before
finally approving a permanent budget on Aug. 4. That missed by a
matter of hours breaking the record for all-time-longest budget
impasse, set on Aug. 4 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the way that leads to timely budgets,'' Broome
County Republican Assemblyman Jay Dinga said, urging his colleagues
to vote against the stopgap spending measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is just unacceptable,'' Dinga said. ''We have a
responsibility to end this way of doing business. We enable a
process. We enable delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the emergency appropriations bill is $457 million to
pay state employees and fringe benefits, $335 million for Medicaid,
and $226 million for welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Not included is money to pay state lawmakers on April 12, their
next scheduled pay day. Under legislation approved at the end of
1998, lawmakers' pay is suspended when the budget is late. Despite
that penalty, last year's budget delay dragged on for four months.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki and the chief legislative leaders, Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, did
meet behind closed doors Thursday trying to move the process along.
It was the first time such a closed-door negotiating session --
previously condemned by Bruno -- has been held on the budget this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, we're not there,'' a grim-faced Bruno said on emerging
from Pataki's office late Thursday afternoon. Republican Bruno said
there was still no three-way agreement on how much money was
available to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly adding strain to the negotiations was a fund-raising
letter Pataki has written on behalf of the Conservative Party
urging the defeat of Democratic candidates seeking state
legislative seats this November -- chiefly members of Silver's
Democratic majority in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining about ''self-righteous 'limousine liberals,''' the
Republican governor called them ''dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This year, the establishment liberals are pouring millions of
dollars into an anything-goes effort to elect more left-wingers to
the Assembly,'' the governor added.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki broadside comes at a time when he has been trying to
form an alliance with Silver to win approval of a new state budget.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 122, Rockets 90  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Rudy Tomjanovich has a good idea why his
Houston Rockets endured their worst loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Spotting them 24 points in transition doesn't work,'' the
Rockets coach said after Thursday night's 122-90 loss to the
Minnesota Timberwolves. ''We're supposed to be a running team. But
you've got to run both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Timberwolves, the Rockets ran neither on offense nor
on defense. They shot just 37 percent from the field, while the
Timberwolves shot 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Garnett scored 25 points and had nine rebounds and Terrell
Brandon added 21 points and 13 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's 52 field goals and 39 assists (compared with just 13
by Houston) were the most the Rockets allowed all year.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' streak of 473 straight games with at least one
3-pointer ended with an 0-for-11 night from 3-point range.
Houston's streak was the second-longest in NBA history, behind
Miami's current run of 494 games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a lot of open looks tonight and I'm normally not used
to getting open looks, but I couldn't knock anything down. Nobody
could,'' said Rockets rookie Steve Francis, who was 3-for-10 from
the field and missed four 3s.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves looked relaxed in winning by more than double
the margin of their previous five games, which had been decided by
a combined 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota has won seven of eight and is 2{ games behind the
Phoenix Suns in the race for fourth place and homecourt advantage
in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that winning has got us loose enough,'' said Garnett.
''Not really loosey-goosey like we would like to be. But I think
the winning and the fact that we're playing well together has got
us really loose. Not to the point where we'll slack off though.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the eighth straight road loss for Houston, which was led
by Walt Williams' 18 points. Francis and Kenny Thomas had 16 each
for the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to give them credit for defense, but we did miss
some of our shots,'' said Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of 12 players scored at least two points for Minnesota.
Dean Garrett was the only player who didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to get guys prepared for the playoffs so everyone
is sharp,'' said Saunders. ''It keeps guys healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine minutes, Houston looked like it was going to
force both teams to keep up with the Rockets' frantic pace in which
Houston had scored over 120 points in back-to-back games earlier in
the week.
</P>
<P>
   But poor shooting, sloppy passing and several embarrassing
turnovers doomed Houston, which is 0-4 against Minnesota this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've got a lot of guys that can shoot the ball,'' said
Williams. ''When you go against a guy like Kevin Garnett who
commands so much attention, other guys are going to reap the
benefits from that.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: Houston's last three games have been decided by 110 points.
... The Timberwolves are 12-3 in March. That ties the team record
set in January for the franchise's best month. ... Houston's
eight-game road losing streak is a season high. ... The Wolves shot
71.4 percent in the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Seattle Mariners closed camp in Arizona with a
new closer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jose Mesa lost his job Thursday after allowing two homers and
six runs in the ninth inning before the Mariners beat San Diego
12-11 on Brian Lesher's RBI single in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Soliz hit a three-run homer and Kevin Eberwein tied the
score at 11 with a solo shot at Peoria, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mesa's not pitching with confidence,'' manager Lou Piniella
said. ''You can see it. His body language on the mound is not good.
I think we're going to have to lessen his role and get him pitching
to where he can be the pitcher he was for us last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa, 33, an All-Star with Cleveland in 1995 and 1996, tied a
Mariners' record with 33 saves last season in his first year with
Seattle. Kazuhiro Sasaki, Japan's career saves leader with 229 in
10 seasons, gets the job after allowing only two runs in nine
innings this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to go with Sasaki as our closer,'' Piniella said.
''He's throwing the ball better than anybody right now. Sure, it's
a tough decision. You don't want to see somebody lose their job in
spring training, but, my God, he's been ineffective.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jupiter, Fla., Mark McGwire hit a two-run homer one day after
leaving a game with a sore back and the St. Louis Cardinals beat
the Baltimore Orioles 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire finished the Florida schedule with a .327 average, seven
homers and 21 RBIs in 52 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew, hit on the right hand with a pitch Wednesday, went
1-for-4 and made three catches in center field in Jupiter, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hand is fine,'' Drew said. ''I just had trouble seeing the
pitches today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lankford also homered for the Cardinals, his fourth of the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   At Tulsa, Okla., Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez was hit by a pitch
on the right elbow during the Rangers' 6-1 victory over Double-A
Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the 1999 American League MVP, was hit in the first
inning by Chuck Smith. It was diagnosed as a bruise and he will be
examined again by team doctors when the Rangers return home.
</P>
<P>
   The injury isn't believed to be serious, but it scared manager
Johnny Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went upstairs to see him and when I came back I was still
shaking,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Pedro Martinez's final spring outing
produced a Boston victor, a pretty standard six strikeouts in five
innings, and relief that his exhibition season is over.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's getting pretty boring,'' Martinez said. ''Discipline is
the only thing that drives you. I wish I didn't have to come to the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the baseball he's sick of, Martinez said, just the idea
that none of it counts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a matter of (games) meaning something or not meaning
something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The real season begins Tuesday for the Red Sox when Martinez
takes the mound in Seattle for Boston's opener with the Mariners.
Last season will be tough to match for Martinez, who was a
unanimous selection for the 1999 Cy Young Award after posting a
23-4 record with a 2.07 ERA and 313 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's not worried about equaling his 1999 numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I take it outing by outing, day by day,'' he said. ''I just
want to stay healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Expos 8, Dodgers 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Vero Beach, Fla., Vladimir Guerrero homered as Montreal won
for the fourth time in five spring games against its opening day
opponent. Todd Hollandsworth hit two solo homers and Adam Riggs
added a two-run shot for the Dodgers.
Pirates 5, Phillies 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Clearwater, Fla., Kris Benson, slated to start Pittsburgh's
second game of the season, pitched like an opening-day starter,
throwing six shutout innings.
Royals 5, Indians 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Haines City, Fla., Cleveland's Chuck Finley tuned up for the
regular season by pitching six innings and Mike Sweeney drove in
two runs for Kansas City.
Blue Jays 11, Reds 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Dunedin, Fla., Tony Batista hit two of the four homers off
Denny Neagle and Cincinnati Gold Glove second baseman Pokey Reese
angrily left the game after getting grazed by a pitch. He wasn't
seriously hurt, but he threw his batting helmet and a paper cup in
the dugout before leaving for the clubhouse.
Braves 9, Marlins 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Melbourne, Fla., Andruw Jones hit his sixth homer of the
spring and Tom Glavine pitched three scoreless innings in his final
tune-up. Atlanta's John Rocker pitched a 1-2-3 eighth inning and
received a huge ovation before and after the inning.
Tigers 13, Devil Rays 6:
</P>
<P>
   At Lakeland, Fla., Juan Encarnacion had five RBIs and Dean
Palmer was 3-for-5 with a home run to lead Detroit.
Athletics 12, Brewers 9:
</P>
<P>
   At Phoenix, Matt Stairs homered and drove in three runs, and Ben
Grieve had three hits and three RBIs for Oakland.
Rockies 7, White Sox 6, 10 innings:
</P>
<P>
   At Tucson, Ariz., Chicago lost reserve outfielder Brian Simmons
for the season to a ruptured left Achilles' tendon in its final
spring game in Arizona.
Astros 6, Yankees 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Houston, Daryle Ward's two-run homer in the eighth inning
lifted the Astros, who christened their new stadium with a
thrilling win before 40,624 at Enron Field. New York's Ricky Ledee
hit the first homer at Enron.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens pitched five innings and allowed two runs on five
hits, while the Astros' Dwight Gooden went five innings without
allowing a run, but was touched for five runs in the sixth.

<HEADLINE> Commission says lobbying expenses in 1999 broke all records  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The creation of the state's new $9 billion
health care financing system brought out more lobbying money than
any one issue in the history of the state, a new report says.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital workers' union and a hospital association spent more
than $10 million lobbying on the Health Care Reform Act (HCRA),
about five times more than has ever been spent lobbying a single
issue in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The HCRA spending sent total reported lobbying expenditures to a
record $71.9 million last year, a 30 percent increase over the
previous year, according to the state Lobbying Commission.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the 19th straight year a new spending record had been
set. Such records have only been maintained in New York since 1978.
Commission officials say only California topped New York in such
expenditures, although they didn't have exact figures available for
that state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lobbying is continuing to be a growth industry in New York,''
said David Grandeau, executive director of the Lobbying Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The new records come only a year after single-issue spending in
Albany broke the $1 million mark for the first time. In 1998, the
New York Life Insurance Company spent $1.82 million on an
unsuccessful attempt to get legislators to overhaul laws governing
how mutual insurance companies can change their corporate status.
</P>
<P>
   And the HCRA spending has started a new arms race in Albany for
lobbyists, where everyone will look at what was spent on that
campaign and try to outdo it for their own issues, good government
groups lamented.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a 'C' word that rules Albany, and it's not 'citizen'
... It's cash,'' said Rachel Leon of Common Cause. Blair Horner of
the New York Public Interest Research Group grumbled: ''Clearly,
the fat cats believe that money talks.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandeau said more of the lobbying money was put into
advertising than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ''The price tag for communication-driven advocacy campaigns
climbed to $12.2 million in 1999, almost six times more than the
$2.3 million spent in 1998,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Expenses for legislative receptions and ''lobby days'' also
posted a 25 percent increase over last year, growing to $1.5
million from $1.2 million, Grandeau said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new spending on HCRA, New York's one-of-a-kind
subsidy system to fund cash-shy aspects of the health care
industry, came from the National Health and Human Service Employees
Union Local 1199, the Service Employees International Union and the
Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA) group called the
Healthcare Education Project. The $10.1 million the coalition spent
went mostly to advertising and other outreach efforts.
</P>
<P>
   However, that wasn't the only HCRA spending. Another Local 1199
organization also spent another $1.5 million, GNYHA spent $1.2
million on its own, the Healthcare Association of New York state
spent $775,000 and the Emergency Coalition to Save New York's
Healthcare spent $605,120.
</P>
<P>
   Their HCRA spending alone took up five of the top 10 spending
slots on the commission's list for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   With the lobbying commission's figures available, a coalition
including NYPIRG, the state League of Women Voters and the state's
chapter of Common Cause released its annual ''Fat Cats Factor''
list. That combines spending by special interests on lobbying and
on campaign contributions to come up with a unified list of
so-called fat cats.
</P>
<P>
   The joint HCRA effort between 1199/SEIU and the Greater New York
Hospital Association also led that list. Coming in second was the
New York State United Teachers, which led the list in 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to the Capitol's most successful lobbying firms,
Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman &AMP; Dicker led the way in 1999,
receiving $3.7 million from 58 clients. The firm also was No. 1 in
1998 and 1997, raking in $3 million and $2.8 million respectively
for its Albany lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, Elser's clients include the American Insurance
Association, the state Blue Cross-Blue Shield Association, the
Hotel Association of New York City, Long Island University and the
Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.

<HEADLINE> Pataki helping Conservatives raise possible anti-Giuliani money  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- While he has endorsed Rudolph Giuliani's
Senate bid against Hillary Rodham Clinton, Gov. George Pataki is
helping the Conservative Party raise money that could help finance
a vote-splitting alternative candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In a fund-raising letter, obtained Thursday by The Associated
Press, the Republican governor asks for donations to the
Conservatives ''so they can fight Hillary Clinton's $25 million
campaign machine.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We must redouble our efforts to put more conservatives in
Albany and keep Hillary Rodham Clinton OUT of the Senate,'' Pataki
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long is actively courting
potential Giuliani alternatives and most political experts believe
a separate Conservative Party candidate could drain votes away from
New York City's Republican mayor and help elect Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican running for statewide office has won in New York
since 1974 without the support of the small, but politically
influential Conservative Party. It provided Pataki with the margin
of victory in his defeat of then-Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   There was no comment on the letter from the Giuliani campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's letter surfaced as Giuliani reported raising a whopping
$7 million and Clinton reported taking in more than $4 million
during the first quarter of this year. That brought the mayor's
total to $19 million since he began raising funds a year ago for
the Senate race. Clinton, who began raising funds in July, saw her
total top $12 million in what is expected to become the most
expensive Senate race in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Relations have been chilly, at best, between the governor and
the mayor since 1994 when Giuliani crossed party lines to back
Cuomo against Pataki. Pataki endorsed Giuliani's Senate bid last
year only after national and state party leaders appealed to the
governor to do so in the name of party unity.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said Thursday that the governor
has been sending such fund-raising letters to help the Conservative
Party ever since he became governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a letter that is designed to help the Conservative
Party which has helped the governor,'' McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility that helping the Conservative Party
run a strong, separate Senate candidate could help elect Clinton,
McKeon said, ''We remain hopeful that the mayor will be able to
work out his issues with the Conservative Party and that he'll be
able to run on the Conservative line.''
</P>
<P>
   Long said Thursday, as he has in the past, that while the door
remains open for an appeal by Giuliani for Conservative Party
support, it appears less and less likely the mayor wants it or
would get it.
</P>
<P>
   Long said the stumbling block remains Giuliani's refusal to
support a ban on what critics call ''partial-birth'' abortions. The
mayor, like Clinton, is an abortion rights supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Long has also demanded the mayor not accept backing from the
state's Liberal Party, which has routinely supported Giuliani's
mayoral campaigns. Liberal Party boss Raymond Harding is one of
Giuliani's closest political advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Long said earlier this week that he has been in discussions with
leaders of the anti-abortion Right to Life Party and the Ross
Perot-inspired Independence Party about fielding a fusion
third-party candidate to oppose Clinton and Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   While the Conservative Party chief said he knew a third-party
contender could help elect Clinton, he maintained that ''if we do
run a separate candidate, we will be running a candidate with the
express purpose of trying to get that candidate elected. We have
the capability of making this a competitive three-way race.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Pataki's letter, Long said: ''We are united in being
against Hillary. I guess there is a difference of opinion
developing between us over Rudy Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Third-party support can be crucial in close New York elections.
Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to also
collect votes on third-party ballot lines.
</P>
<P>
   Several anti-abortion Republicans, including Operation Rescue
founder Randall Terry and former U.S. Rep. Joseph DioGuardi of
Westchester County, are considering entering the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Long said he expected at least one viable Giuliani alternative
to announce for the Senate by the end of April. The Conservative
Party chairman refused to identify the potential candidate, but
said he believed it was a person who could win the backing of both
the Conservative and Right to Life parties.

<HEADLINE> Bush to headline Conservative Party dinner  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Expected Republican presidential nominee
George W. Bush has agreed to speak at the annual dinner of the New
York Conservative Party, the head of the influential third party
says.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long said Bush's decision to
speak at the New York City event on May 17 was ''a clear signal''
that the Texas governor's presidential campaign isn't writing off
the heavily Democratic state for November, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts have said they do not expect the GOP to
contest New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear to me the governor and his campaign have not made
up their minds to walk away from New York,'' Long said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican presidential candidate has carried New York, where
Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 5-3 margin, since Ronald
Reagan pulled it off in 1980 and 1984. Reagan courted New York's
Conservative Party early on, speaking at its annual dinner in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's possible to do it again,'' Long said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our people aren't going to sit on their hands in this race,''
Long added. ''They don't want (Democrat) Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has not been officially endorsed by the Conservative
Party, Long said he expected the Texas governor would easily win
the party's backing.
</P>
<P>
   Long said Bush's appearance at the $500-a-person dinner would
not only help him in New York, but because of media coverage
spilling into neighboring Connecticut and New Jersey, those states
as well.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki is expected to attend the
Conservative Party dinner, as he usually does.
</P>
<P>
   Not on the invitation list is New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, the Republican running for the U.S. Senate against
Hillary Rodham Clinton. Giuliani, who has had Liberal Party backing
in his mayoral campaigns, has never been invited to the annual
Conservative Party dinner. Long has been looking for a
Giuliani-Clinton alternative to run for the Senate on the
Conservative Party line.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, third party support can be important in close races
because unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates
to add the votes from minor party ballot lines to their totals.
Pataki won the 1994 governor's race over Democratic incumbent Mario
Cuomo on the strength of the vote on the Conservative Party line.

<HEADLINE> Icahn Seeks 31 Pct. Nabisco Stake  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Will it be different this time for Carl Icahn
and Nabisco?
</P>
<P>
   One of the 1980's most daring corporate raiders is prepared to
make a $1.3 billion cash tender offer for roughly 31 percent of
Nabisco Group Holdings Corp., saying it would increase his chances
for electing his nominees to the board which in turn would make
selling the company its first priority.
</P>
<P>
   The plans Icahn outlined in a letter Thursday represent his most
ambitious effort yet to gain control of the company that was
created when RJR Nabisco Holdings spun off its cigarette holdings
in the face of mounting legal challenges to tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   He already owns 8.9 percent of Nabisco Group stock. He had
previously backed three failed proxy fights for control of the RJR
Nabisco board.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Group Holdings' sole asset is an 80.5 percent stake in
Nabisco Holdings Corp., the food company that makes Ritz crackers,
Oreo cookies and Planters nuts.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from its headquarters in Parsippany, N.J.,
Nabisco Group said its board would review Icahn's proposal and
urged shareholders to take no action in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn said Thursday he was prepared to start a tender offer on
Tuesday of $13 a share for a total of 100 million shares of Nabisco
Group provided that the company drops its poison pill provision
adopted earlier this month to discourage unwelcome suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Nabisco Group climbed 26 percent, rising $2.43} to
$11.75 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Nabisco board adopted the poison pill, which allows
shareholders to buy more stock at a discount if an unwanted suitor
gets 10 percent of its shares, after Icahn announced he intended to
run a slate of candidates for election to the board.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn described the move Thursday as ''yet another expression of
contempt for stockholders'' by the Nabisco Group board.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Icahn had opposed spinning off the tobacco holdings
and advocated spinning off RJR's food operations instead. Nabisco
Group shares have fallen 54 percent since the tobacco spinoff,
through Wednesday's close, and it is now clear his plan would have
''achieved a far superior result for shareholders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the price of Nabisco Group shares have been
depressed by investor's concerns that smokers or others who may win
big damage claims against tobacco companies may eventually seek
payment from Nabisco Group because its predecessor RJR Nabisco
owned R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn said in the letter that the clock is ticking on tobacco
litigation, particularly with a jury in Miami considering awarding
damages that ''could result in an appeal bond that is prohibitively
expensive'' for Reynolds and other tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   He said the litigation and other liability issues ''could have a
very adverse effect on tobacco-related companies, their securities
and their appeal to potential buyers in the future'' and added
''now, not later'' is the time to sell Nabisco Group.
</P>
<P>
   He did not identify any potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Burry, who follows tobaco stocks for Brown Brothers
Harriman, said Icahn probably feels ''the risk associated with the
litigation factors is not as great as the market fears them to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If he can find way to unlock that value, he is going to do
very well,'' Burry said.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn already owns about 31 million shares of Nabisco Group;
another 100 million shares would give him about 40 percent of its
stock. Nabisco Group had about 325 million shares outstanding at
the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He said that stake would facilitate election of his nominees for
the board, and said the new board's ''first order of business''
would be to consider the sale of Nabisco Group at a favorable
price.
</P>
<P>
   He set two other conditions for starting the tender offer -- that
Nabisco Group approve his purchase of shares despite a Delaware law
that would otherwise limit him to owning no more than 15 percent of
its shares and setting a new date for the annual meeting so that he
could vote the shares he purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The annual meeting is currently scheduled for May 9.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Labor activists are ''shocked and
surprised'' that some restaurant and tavern workers could see their
minimum wage go up by just 40 cents, and not the 62 additional
cents an hour they expected starting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A bill passed by the state Legislature Thursday would set the
state minimum wage for those workers at $3.30 an hour, up from the
$2.90 an hour they have been entitled to, but not the $3.52 an hour
they could have received starting April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The higher raise for tipped workers was originally approved by
the Legislature in December as part of a bill increasing wages for
farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the hospitality industry objected to a $3.52 an hour wage.
Restaurant and tavern owners complained that since those workers
are pocketing tips from patrons, their actual wages are well past
the state or federal minimums.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are outraged that the Legislature would choose to take this
amount of money -- 22 cents -- away from the lowest wage earners in
the state,'' said Mario Cilento, a spokesman for the state AFL-CIO.
''They've turned their backs on these hardworking men and women.
It's shocking that they wouldn't take into concern the real needs
of the lowest wage earners in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Cilento said the workers are now depending on Gov. George Pataki
to take their needs into concern.
</P>
<P>
   A Pataki spokesman said the governor is supportive of the
general goal of the bill, but troubled by some of its minor points,
such as the establishment of a wage board to monitor the workers'
pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor's going to look at the specifics of the bill, but
clearly there are unrelated items that are troublesome,'' Charles
Deister said.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly held a sometimes heated debate on the bill, which
the chairwoman of the Assembly's labor committee, Queens Democrat
Catherine Nolan, defended.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan told her colleagues if they did not pass the legislation,
the workers would be unlikely to see any increase. She said since
both chambers have passed the $3.30 legislation, it is likely to
become law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think $3.30 is a big step forward,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But others strongly disagreed, saying it was unfair of
legislators to take away what had been ''promised'' to workers,
especially two days before the raise would have taken effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is probably the most ludicrous thing I've ever seen,''
said David Townsend Jr., a Republican from Oneida County. ''It's
unheard of. When did we ever take money away from anybody? If
someone told you you'd get a raise, you'd expect it to be there.
This is crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Grannis, a Democrat from Manhattan, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is, if not improper, then immoral,'' he said. ''I
think this is the wrong thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The December farm worker bill increased the state's minimum wage
from $4.25 an hour to the federal minimum wage of $5.15 an hour. It
also mandated any change to the federal minimum wage automatically
apply to the farm worker's state minimum wage -- effectively
abolishing the state's lower minimum wage for those workers.

<HEADLINE> Parking officials say disabled tags widely abused  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- At least one of every five disabled parking
tags used by Buffalo drivers hangs from the rearview mirror of an
able-bodied driver, City Hall officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are those abusing the system -- government employees and
law enforcement officers among them -- squeezing into scarce parking
spaces, they are cheating the city out of meter fees, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The parking tags entitle disabled drivers to park for free so
Buffalo may be losing as much as $300,000 year in parking meter
revenue, according to a report Thursday in The Buffalo News.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Sunday, the state's fine for abusing permits jumps from
$55 to $85.
</P>
<P>
   During a crackdown earlier this month, Buffalo enforcement
officers confiscated more than a dozen permits that were used
illegally. Abusers have been known to forge or steal permits, or
use those issued to an elderly friend or relative or someone who
has died. Still others lie to a doctor who certifies them as
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   John Vertimo, superintendent of parking enforcement, stopped a
woman last week as she stepped from a vehicle displaying a
handicapped parking tag.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said it's her mother's card, and her mother's in a nursing
home,'' he said. ''I told her, 'Ma'am, you're using the card
illegally.'''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, checks of government records showed the permit
belonged to a West Seneca man who died almost two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's problem is unique in New York, since other large
cities do not offer free parking to holders of disabled passes.
They may reserve spots for handicapped drivers, but the spots
require meters be fed, like the others.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Russell, regional administrator of the Eastern Paralyzed
Veterans Association, favors eliminating or changing Buffalo's
policy because of growing abuse of the passes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a quadriplegic -- it's going to hurt me more than others,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Masiello called the city's free parking policy for
the disabled ''a classic example of government help that goes
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To abuse disabled parking is unconscionable,'' he said. ''If
this practice doesn't work ... if people are taking advantage of
it, then obviously we need a thorough review and overhaul.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Schaffner, executive director of the Albany Parking
Authority, said his city uses shorter poles for its meters and
makes a special effort to keep them free of snow in winter so
disabled drivers have no trouble reaching them.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Buffalo's problem is a lack of coordination among
local governments, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo has more than 10,450 outstanding passes and towns and
villages have handed out thousands more. But there is no central
registry of permits and no formal procedure for governments to
check on permits issued outside their borders.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Sciolino, city director of parking enforcement, claims
there are enough abusers in Buffalo alone to completely fill
downtown's 1,500 metered spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some blocks that don't take in any money ... We can
estimate the city is losing anywhere between $50,000 to $300,000 a
year,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> State regulator says PSC will review Con Ed outage  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state's utility-regulating board will
begin a formal review of whether Consolidated Edison should be
allowed to pass through costs of its Indian Point 2 nuclear plant
outage to ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   The chairwoman of the Public Service Commission, Maureen Helmer,
said information about the outage gathered by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and her agency shows a ''prudence
investigation'' is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The commission would disallow any costs, including replacement
power costs, that it finds are imprudent,'' Helmer said in a letter
to state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno explaining the
prudence investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Helmer also asked the Senate to back off a bill barring Con Ed
from charging ratepayers for the outage-related costs, saying her
agency has the authority to do the same thing with fewer
complications.
</P>
<P>
   Several legislators requested that the commission review Con
Ed's plans to begin charging its ratepayers for the replacement
costs the company has incurred since Indian Point 2 was knocked off
line Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Gov. George Pataki's office released a report on
the Indian Point outage prepared by several state agencies and the
governor called on Con Ed to be ''held accountable for all
appropriate costs for this incident.''
</P>
<P>
   A leak in a tube at the plant carrying radioactive water
resulted in the release of a minute amount of radioactive steam
into the atmosphere. There was no measurable effect on the
environment and no one was injured, but it resulted in the first
alert in the plant's 26-year history.
</P>
<P>
   There is wide sentiment among state lawmakers in Con Ed's
service territory for a bill prohibiting the utility from passing
along costs of the Indian Point outage to customers. Utility
executives had said they planned to start adding the charges,
estimated at about $3 a month, to customers' bills.
</P>
<P>
   It is costing the utility up to $600,000 a day to buy
electricity to replace that generated at Indian Point 2.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed critics argue that the company should absorb the costs of
the outage because its executives allegedly knew of impending
problems, but did not move in time to replace the equipment which
failed on Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   No date had been set for the start of the prudence hearing, but
Helmer said it should begin as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The state Assembly has already approved the ''no-pass-through''
bill related to the Indian Point 2 outage, but Helmer asked Bruno
not to have his chamber consider it for now.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bill would provide no additional benefits for electric
customers because the law clearly provides for refunds of
unreasonable outage costs'' as determined by the PSC, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Helmer said she doubts the legality of the Con Ed
bill, or at least is fairly certain it would be challenged in the
courts if approved by the Legislature and governor. Utilities have
successfully fought similar bills in New York in the past which
single out individual companies on grounds that they were being
denied equal protection rights under the constitution.

   Consolidated Edison spokesmen did not return calls seeking
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a report called a ''lessons-learned evaluation,'' Ashok
Thadani, director of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Regulatory
Research, said that if Con Ed had done a more thorough job, it
would have been able to predict ''an increased probability of tube
leakage or rupture'' by June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration inquiry into the Indian Point 2 outage
said there were reporting problems from off-site radiation
monitoring sites following the plant leak and ''lapses'' in the way
Con Ed provided information to agencies outside the utility about
the equipment failure.

<HEADLINE> NYPIRG: More ATMs now levying surcharges  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The number of automated teller machines in
New York that charge non-account holders has nearly tripled in
three years, a consumer advocacy group says.
</P>
<P>
   This year 93 percent of ATMs surveyed by the New York Public
Interest Group have surcharges, up from 33 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   NYPIRG's Russ Haven said Thursday consumers are ''getting
whacked twice'' each time they use an ATM -- once by their banks and
again by ATM operators.
</P>
<P>
   Banks don't usually charge customers who have an account with
them to use their ATMs. But account holders are charged between $1
and $1.50 for using competitors' ATMs, Haven said. On top of that,
ATM operators on average levy a surcharge of $1.33 for each
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like putting tolls on both ends of a bridge,'' Haven
said. ''We accept and understand that banks need to make money by
charging an access fee, but two times is too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Haven said 45 percent of the 366 ATMs surveyed were located in
bank premises, going against banks' claims that surcharges are
necessary to cover costs of providing ATMs at remote locations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Surcharges are also anti-competitive, Haven added, because
larger banks have more outlets. That could drive consumers away
from smaller community banks in favor of larger banks to avoid
paying ATM surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   The NYPIRG report also found that non-bank owners, called
independent service operators, impose some of the highest fees, up
to $2.00 for each transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Aurelia Greene, a Democrat from the Bronx, is
sponsoring a bill to prohibit ATM owners from surcharging
non-customers, but the measure is opposed by the banking lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Nessa Feddis of the American Bankers Association said that since
a federal ban on ATM fees was lifted in 1996, the number of ATMs
have more than doubled, making it more convenient for consumers.
She said independent service operators account for most of the
growth, installing machines in places like supermarkets, train
stations and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without surcharges, you wouldn't have a lot of ATMs,'' Feddis
said. ''Most ATMs weren't profitable before the surcharges.''
</P>
<P>
   Haven said legislative action is ''unlikely'' on a state level
and it is up to local municipalities to implement any bans.
</P>
<P>
   He cited New York City -- with the heftiest surcharge average of
about $1.41 -- as an example. In January, City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone introduced legislation that would bar banks from imposing
ATM surcharges on customers from other financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear, however, whether a local government has the
authority to require the elimination of the fees and Vallone had
acknowledged that if the bill is passed, the banking industry will
likely file a lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Bennett founders claim trustee plotted their downfall for his owngain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) -- The founders of the bankrupt Bennett Funding
Group blame the former federal Securities and Exchange Commission
chief for their company's demise, and are seeking $5.8 billion in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Breeden, who directed the U.S. commission during the
Bush administration, ''quarterbacked'' a federal investigation into
their companies as part of a scheme to take over the businesses,
Edmund T. and Kathleen Bennett contend in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to damages, the Bennetts are asking U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Stephen D. Gerling to remove Breeden from his court-appointed
role as manager of the bankrupt companies. Breeden is responsible
for repaying as much money as possible to investors and creditors
and stands to make millions of dollars as trustee.
</P>
<P>
   The Bennett's accusations come even as their son, Patrick R.
Bennett, appears today in a Manhattan federal courtroom. He faces
up to 30 years in prison after being convicted last year on 49
charges that he used the family companies to cheat investors. He
also must repay $109 million.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities accused Bennett and his brother, Michael, of
running one of the largest pyramid schemes ever uncovered through
their Syracuse-based office equipment lease financing businesses.
Prosecutors said the Bennetts cheated as many as 12,000 investors
out of nearly $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bennett pleaded guilty in 1998 to charges of conspiracy,
obstruction of justice and perjury. He faces a maximum of 15 years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not charge the elder Bennetts in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bennetts filed their lawsuit Wednesday without the aid
of a lawyer. They said they did not have money to hire an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The Bennett's complaint came in response to four lawsuits
Breeden filed against them seeking the return of money to the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Bennetts were supposed to respond to requests by Breeden for
information not make accusations of their own, said William
Russell, whose law firm works for the trustee. He said the
Bennett's allegations were ''ill-founded'' and ''lacking in any
basis in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The response speaks for itself. This happens to be what the
facts are,'' Edmund Bennett told The Post-Standard of Syracuse from
his home in Ellenton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Bennett's court papers contend Breeden manipulated and
falsified the Bennett companies' books to make the company seem
insolvent. They pointed out that Breeden served as chairman of the
U.S. Securities Exchange Commission until 1993, when the agency
initiated the investigation of fraud at the Bennett companies.
</P>
<P>
   Breeden orchestrated the federal investigation and used his
influence to gain control of their companies, the Bennetts claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The $5.8 billion in damages that the Bennetts asked for is the
same amount Breeden seeks in the lawsuits he has filed against
them, the couple said.
</P>
<P>
   Breeden has not yet seen the Bennett's lawsuit and had no
immediate comment, said attorney Gary Mucci, who is helping handle
the case. The Bennetts have leveled the same accusations previously
and Breeden has denied them.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett Funding was the cornerstone in a small empire that
included hotels, racetrack investments, resort financing and
investments in gambling enterprises. The Securities Exchange
Commission filed a civil complaint against the company in 1996
alleging that the companies cheated investors by selling bogus
leases.
</P>
<P>
   The companies entered bankruptcy the next day. Breeden has said
the Bennett companies owe more than $1 billion to 21,000 creditors.
</P>
<P>
   The trustee has said he expects to collect about $720 million
for creditors by the end of the case. He may ask for up to 3
percent of what he collects, which means he could earn $21.6
million.

<HEADLINE> SEC May Delay Trading in Decimals  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators' July 3 deadline for U.S.
stock exchanges to begin trading stocks in decimals may be extended
by a few months, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt told a House
Appropriations subcommittee that he was ''frankly dismayed and
disappointed'' by a request for a delay in starting decimal stock
trading by the brokers' group that operates the Nasdaq Stock
Market. But he told the lawmakers the SEC likely will extend the
deadline for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be absolutely certain that our markets are
systemically ready to handle the transition'' to decimals, Levitt
said. As for the length of the expected delay, he said, ''We're
talking about months, not more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Levitt said the delay could be one or two
months.
</P>
<P>
   The brokers' group, the National Association of Securities
Dealers, recently told the SEC that its computer systems, strained
by record trading volumes, are not ready to handle a switch to
decimals by July 3. The NASD has asked for a delay until next year.
</P>
<P>
   The rival New York Stock Exchange has said its systems are
prepared to meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the SEC ordered all the nation's stock exchanges to
begin quoting at least some share prices in dollars and cents by
July 3, requiring them to fully abandon the 200-year-old use of
fractions by year's end. Under the SEC's plan, some stocks are to
begin trading in 5-cent increments, with many possibly trading in
penny increments by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, SEC officials resisted extending the
deadline in response to the NASD's request.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Peterson, a spokesman for the Nasdaq market, had no
immediate comment on Levitt's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the all-electronic market scheduled a news
conference on technology issues today.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say adopting the decimal system would help ordinary
investors by narrowing the difference between a stock's best bid
and asking prices, known as the spread. Spreads typically vary from
12{ cents to 50 cents, an amount that adds up to a sizable profit
for brokers, who take in a percentage based on the size of the
spread.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argue that a narrower spread will make the markets
more competitive and efficient, increase trading volume and improve
liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, critics say the narrower spreads in decimal trading
would erode profits, something that could reduce the number of
market makers, the firms which form a market's backbone by
facilitating trading.
</P>
<P>
   In other securities industry developments Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   --In his congressional testimony, Levitt also defended the SEC's
plan to create an automated surveillance system to search the
Internet for investment fraud, which has raised privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC ''has always been mindful of its responsibilities and
restrictions'' regarding privacy, he said, adding that the
surveillance project ''is in no way a new effort to seek out
information.'' SEC investigators now monitor the Internet manually
using computer search engines.
</P>
<P>
   --Houston day trader Fred Moldofsky was arrested on charges of
securities fraud for allegedly posting a fake press release about
Lucent Technologies Inc. on a Yahoo! online message board. In
addition to a criminal complaint, filed by the U.S. attorney for
the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Postal Inspection
Service, the SEC also sued Moldofsky in a civil action seeking an
unspecified fine.
</P>
<P>
   Moldofsky's attorney, Scott Schrader, did not immediately return
a telephone call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> PetroChina Shares Priced Low  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Shares in PetroChina Inc.'s initial public
offering were priced at the lower end of their expected range,
after opposition from organized labor and human rights activists
appeared to dampen investor interest.
</P>
<P>
   The oil and gas producer, a subsidiary of China's state-run oil
company, sold shares in Hong Kong and New York on Thursday raising
$2.89 billion. The company had hoped to raise as much as $3.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong shares were priced at 1.28 Hong Kong dollars (16.4
cents) each, the investment bank Goldman Sachs said Friday. The
shares had been expected to price between 1.23 Hong Kong dollars
and 1.49 Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The American depositary shares, which will trade on the New York
Stock Exchange, were priced at $16.44 each, on the low end of the
company's $15.93 to $19.40 range.
</P>
<P>
   Shares begin trading in New York on April 6 and in Hong Kong
April 7.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions and human rights activists in the United States
have mounted a campaign urging investors, particularly mutual
funds, to stay away from the Chinese oil company. Opponents say the
deal is risky and morally questionable because of Beijing's record
on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   PetroChina's chairman Ma Fucai last weekend dismissed criticism
that the company, or its parent, China's main state-owned oil and
gas company China National Petroleum Corp., violated human rights
in China.

<HEADLINE> Tiger To Liquidate Funds Worth $6B  </HEADLINE>
By NOELLE KNOX, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Noted money manager Julian H. Robertson Jr.
announced he is liquidating the $6 billion Tiger Management
investment funds, calling the current market frenzy for technology
stocks a ''Ponzi pyramid destined for collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson took 18 years to build Tiger into the largest hedge
fund family in the world with assets of $23 billion. Tiger's demise
took just 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's reversal of fortune highlights the radical shift in
the markets to technology and Internet stocks and away from
traditional industries. And Robertson, who stuck with his strategy
of picking undervalued industrial stocks, is still in a state of
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current technology, Internet and telecom craze, fueled by
the performance desires of investors, money managers and even
financial buyers, is unwittingly creating a Ponzi pyramid destined
for collapse,'' he wrote in a letter to investors Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''We have seen manic periods like this before and I
remain confident that despite the current disfavor in which it is
held, value investing remains the best course.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Management lost 13 percent in the first two months of the
year, following a 19 percent drop last year.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he will liquidate most of the assets in Tiger's
six hedge funds over the next two months and repay investors.
Several of Tiger's stakes, however, are too big to sell quickly.
For the short term, Robertson said he will hold onto investments in
five companies, including US Airways and United Asset Management
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one wishes more than I that I had taken this course
earlier,'' he said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Tiger's problem was its size, experts said. Most hedge
funds have less than $1 billion in assets, so their investments are
usually easy to buy and sell without moving the markets.
</P>
<P>
   ''When US Airways started to go against him, even though in his
heart of hearts he wanted to sell or hedge, he couldn't because he
had such a big position,'' said Charles Gradante, chief investment
officer for the Hennessee Group, a hedge fund advisory firm. ''It's
like the Queen Mary turning around vs. a smaller sailboat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds like Tiger are incorporated overseas and cater to
multimillionaires, universities, endowments and the like. Hedge
funds, which are largely unregulated, can make riskier investments
than mutual funds. For example, hedge funds often borrow huge sums
of money to pour into stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities.
</P>
<P>
   The hedge fund industry came under increased scrutiny in 1998
when the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Partners threatened the
solvency of several investment banks that had lent the hedge fund
money.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Tiger, which invested in the wrong stocks, Long-Term
Capital borrowed heavily and then lost huge sums of money betting
on the interest rates of bonds. Long-Term Capital has since
recovered and repaid the companies that bailed out the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Robertson's recent troubles, his track record is still
impressive. Since he founded Tiger in 1980 with $8 million in
capital, he has posted a compounded rate of return of 32 percent,
after fees. Robertson's own wealth is also still remarkable; $1.5
billion of Tiger's assets are his.

<HEADLINE> CSX Rail System Found Dangerous  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Railroad Administration has found
potentially dangerous defects in many areas of the CSX
Transportation rail system used by passenger and commuter trains
all along the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   A 60 percent increase in track-caused accidents over five years
on the 22,700-mile system prompted the agency to begin a two-week
systemwide track audit on Feb. 22, The Washington Post reported
Friday on its Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   The review found many instances where the distance between the
rails had spread wide enough to risk derailments.
</P>
<P>
   Two such wide areas were found in the District of Columbia on
the line used by Amtrak, Virginia Railway Express and all
north-south CSX freight trains. The defects were repaired
immediately after they were found.
</P>
<P>
   Defects were also found in Florida, Pennsylvania and Maryland
</P>
<P>
   Two of three recent track-caused derailments were caused by wide
track, including a minor derailment of Amtrak's Chicago-Washington
Capitol Limited at Connellsville, Pa., on Jan. 30, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   George Gavalla, the agency's associate administrator for safety,
said he worried about the type of defects inspectors found.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look at the nature of the defects, these are
conditions that should not exist on any Class One (major)
railroad,'' Gavalla told the Post. ''We will not tolerate wide
gauge on any railroad.''
</P>
<P>
   CSX President Ronald Conway called the conditions
''unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever is necessary to do, we'll do,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 96, Mavericks 85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Rasheed Wallace scored a season-high 34
points as the Portland Trail Blazers snapped a four-game home
losing streak with a 96-85 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace hit 16-of-22 shots from the field and Steve Smith added
22 points for the Blazers, who had lost six of their last eight
games at home and had dropped eight of 14 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley scored 30 points to lead Dallas, which had won
four straight on the road. Dallas' loss clinched a playoff spot for
the idle Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's 34 was a season high for the Blazers, topping Damon
Stoudamire's 30 on Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Portland led 77-69 at the end of three quarters, but Dallas
pulled within four points down the stretch. Finley's jumper with
six minutes left cut the Blazers' lead to 84-80, but after the
teams traded turnovers, Scottie Pippen drove the baseline for a
dunk to put Portland up 86-80.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace then added a reverse layup, a hook shot and a mid-range
jumper to seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers started the third quarter with an 8-0 run and led by
10 points most of the quarter as Wallace had eight points,
including six in the first two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Without injured center Arvydas Sabonis, the Blazers avoided much
confrontation with the Mavericks' 7-foot-6 Shawn Bradley by hitting
their outside shots in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Portland went up 21-10 on one of Wallace's deep jump shots with
2:55 left, but the Mavericks closed to 25-19 by the end of the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas stayed close in the second quarter, tying the game at
34-all when Finley hit a jumper over Detlef Schrempf with 7:05
left. But the Blazers pulled away at the end of the quarter by
going on an 11-3 run sparked by 3-pointers from Smith, Pippen and
Greg Anthony that gave them a 54-45 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes:  The Blazers' four-game home losing streak was their
longest in four seasons. ... Wallace's eight field goals in the
first quarter topped the Mavericks' team total for the period.
Dallas was 7-of-20 in the opening quarter. ... Wallace's 16 total
field goals were a season high for the Blazers. The previous mark
was 13. ... Pippen went down hard after taking an elbow from
Jermaine O'Neal in the third quarter, and went to the locker room
feeling lightheaded. He returned in the third. ... Coming into the
game, Dallas led the league with 39 percent 3-point shooting, but
the Mavericks hit just three of 21 3-pointers in the loss.

<HEADLINE> Student claims coaches saw hazing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRUMBULL, Conn. (AP) -- Two Trumbull High School coaches have
been implicated in the hazing of a 15-year-old special education
student by members of the wrestling team.
</P>
<P>
   A team member told police that both the wrestling and basketball
coaches at the school saw the victim hog-tied and did nothing, the
Connecticut Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody pushed (the victim) into a wall and he was crying,''
the 15-year-old student said in his statement to police. ''Then the
(wrestling) coach came in and saw (the victim) tied up and he
yelled at us for not warming up. He also saw another wrestler tied
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The student said that after practice, the wrestling coach
ordered the team members to put the mats away promptly or ''we
would have to run for what we did to (the victim).''
</P>
<P>
   As the victim, a freshman team member, was being untied, a male
basketball coach walked in, but said the nothing and left, the
student said.
</P>
<P>
   The wrestling coach was identified as Josh Tolk. The basketball
coach was not named.
</P>
<P>
   Tolk, who is not a teacher at the school, could not be reached
for comment Thursday. Calls to the school were referred to
Superintendent Ralph Iassogna, who said he could not discuss the
specifics of the case because the investigation is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   He said action has been taken against Tolk, but he would not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wrestling team captains Daniel R. Scinto Jr., 18;
Jeremy Dommu, 18; and Christopher Ricci, 16, were arraigned in
Bridgeport Superior Court Thursday on charges of assault and
unlawful restraint. They are due back in court April 27.
</P>
<P>
   Eight students were arrested in February and seven expelled in
connection with the hazing. Police say the victim, a student with
learning disabilities, was stuffed inside a locker, slammed into a
wall and sodomized with a plastic knife handle in a series of
attacks that began in December.
</P>
<P>
   The victim suffered a serious knee injury in one incident and is
receiving counseling for emotional trauma.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement to police, the juvenile said that he, too, had
been hog-tied, thrown into a shower and locked in his locker ''a
few times'' during a two-month period. But he never filed a police
report.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was kind of like a ritual,'' the boy said.

Relations Board have agreed to settle charges that the school
threatened teaching assistants who were involved in a grade strike.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, about 80 members of the student organization refused to

continued.

   Wednesday's agreement leaves open the question of whether the
graduate student teaching assistants are employees of the
university under federal labor law.
</P>
<P>
   Yale maintains the teaching assistants are not employees, but
are primarily students who are trying to get their graduate
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   University Provost Alison Richard said the agreement does not
affect Yale's position.
</P>
<P>
   The Graduate Employees and Students Organization claims that
graduate students who teach undergraduate classes should be
recognized as employees. The group's leaders took the ruling as a
sign that they could unionize.
</P>
<P>
   The labor relations board is scheduled to rule soon in a New
York University case on whether graduate teaching assistants are
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to me the NLRB wasn't going to decide employee status
twice,'' said Rebecca Ruquist, the chairwoman of the Yale graduate
student group.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Yale will post notices around campus that
the National Labor Relations Act gives all employees the right to
form and join unions and bargain collectively.
</P>
<P>
   Yale also agreed not to interfere with or restrain employees
from exercising these rights.
</P>
<P>
   The NLRB case concerned statements made by four faculty members
that unions were inappropriate and that failure to comply with
teaching assistant duties could lead to the loss of teaching jobs
and negative evaluations.

<HEADLINE> Development supporters push plans despite criticism  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Some state lawmakers are asking whether
the major developers of Adriaen's Landing are putting enough of
their own money into the proposed project.
</P>
<P>
   The riverfront development in Hartford and football stadium in
East Hartford would be built with $455 million in public money and
over $210 million in private funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Waterford Group, the main private developer, has said it
will spend $20 million to build a hotel at Adriaen's Landing. But
Rep. Robert Landino said that isn't enough of a commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they have no business risk, then the state of Connecticut
is on the hook,'' Landino, D-Westbrook, said Thursday during a
public hearing before the Legislature's appropriations and finance
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Waterford developed the Mohegan Sun casino in Montville and
operates hotels in Mystic, New London and Norwich. Wolman
Construction Co., owned Waterford, is building a $38 million
Marriott hotel in Groton. The firm operates 24 properties in eight
states.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Waterford Group expressed the most interest in Adriaen's
Landing,'' said Brendan Fox, executive director of the Capital City
Economic Development Authority, a quasi-public agency that would
own the project along with the state Waterford.
</P>
<P>
   About $355 million of the state money would be bonded for the
project, which includes a 700-room hotel, a convention center,
entertainment and retail space and nearly 400 housing units on
Hartford's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're going to bond that much, I could see what's going to
happen with other bonding projects like school construction,'' said
Rep. Anne McDonald, D-Stamford, co-chairwoman of the Finance
Committee. ''There could be a really serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   About 3,400 construction jobs and more than 1,100 permanent jobs
are expected to be created, and supporters say the project will
bring clout to Connecticut's capital city.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you have before you is good for the site, good for the
city ... and good for the state,'' Fox said during a public hearing
before the Legislature's finance and appropriations committees.
</P>
<P>
   The Adriaen's Landing plan has changed since first proposed two
years ago when it expected to revolve around a football stadium for
the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots backed out of the deal last year, and a contingency
plan to build a domed stadium for the University of Connecticut's
football team went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Plans changed again when United Technologies Corp. donated its
75-acre Rentschler Field in East Hartford for the UConn stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The school is upgrading from Division I-AA to Division I-A and
needs at least a 35,000-seat stadium to make the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The move to Division I-A is right for UConn, and in my view
right for the state of Connecticut,'' said UConn President Philip
Austin. ''It will support us and help us build on our progress on
many fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   A report by the state's Office of Legislative Research
questioned many facets of the project, including why the apartment
rents at Adriaen's Landing are expected to start at about $1,400.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said private studies show that there is an interest in
high-priced downtown housing.
</P>
<P>
   The report also criticizes the 40,000-seat UConn stadium aspect
of the deal, which would cost the state $90.7 million. It points to
a study that assumes 25,000 fans would attend home games in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why do we need a 40,000-seat stadium for 25,000 fans,'' the
report asks.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between the state, or ''memorandum of
understanding,'' says the state and UConn will split the money made
by the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''The MOU has an Alice in Wonderland quality to it,'' the report
says. ''After all, UConn is part of the state. This makes the
elaborate dividing up of revenues from the stadium seem slightly
unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly is expected to decide in April whether to
fund the project.

<HEADLINE> Report: Taiwan's Military Outdated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taiwan's military is technologically outdated
and faces a ''host of problems'' that make the island vulnerable to
attack from China, according to highly classified Pentagon report
described to The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-page report warns that Taiwan may have trouble defending
itself against airplanes and missiles and concludes that its
military capability has been weakened through years of diplomatic
isolation, the Post reported in its Friday editions.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report, which suggests Taiwan is much more
vulnerable to attack from China than generally recognized, comes in
the wake of aggressive Chinese threats related to the recent
presidential election in Taiwan. A pro-independence candidate was
elected, further rankling China, which sees Taiwan as part of
greater China.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report says the Taiwanese military has poor
security at its bases and is failing to train senior personnel to
properly operate weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's military has missed the information revolution, the
report suggests, failing to integrate advances in information
processing into its operations. Among other things, these advances
allow for militaries to detect fast-moving and hidden targets,
transfer the information and guide weapons to their targets.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no other military in the world that experiences the
kind of isolation Taiwan's does,'' a Clinton administration
official told the Post, summarizing the report. ''They don't train
or have contacts with anyone. And as warfare has become more
complex, it has become more difficult for them to handle all these
new technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper did not identify the official, who described the
report as highly sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   The report could become important in a touchy debate over
whether the United States should sell Taiwan four sophisticated
Aegis guided-missile destroyers and other advanced military
equipment. That includes long-range radar that could peer deep into
the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
   China opposes a sale, saying such action would be a hostile
''last straw'' in U.S.-Chinese relations. The Clinton
administration is expected to decide what to do by the end of
April.
</P>
<P>
   The report sheds further doubt on whether the equipment would be
too sophisticated for Taiwan to use properly.
</P>
<P>
   The report was produced by officers who work for the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and by officials in the policy office of the
defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Taiwan government office in Washington
declined to comment to the Post.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing still claims Taiwan as part of its territory even though
they have been governed separately since splitting 51 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Nine Injured in Laos Explosion  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW PENNINGTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- An explosion Thursday night at a
restaurant in the Laotian capital injured at least nine people,
eight of them foreign tourists, diplomats and residents said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what caused the blast, a rare
violent incident in the normally placid city of Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were seriously injured, including a Briton, a
German and one Laotian. All were taken for treatment to neighboring
Thailand. Six other tourists were treated for cuts and lacerations
at the Australian Embassy Clinic in Vientiane, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Police sealed off the area around the restaurant. Infrastructure
damage was reportedly small.
</P>
<P>
   Two Australian journalists were detained by Laotian authorities
for four hours after filming the damaged restaurant. Their film was
confiscated, a diplomat at the Australian embassy said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Laotian Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the
explosion. Laos is run by a highly secretive communist government.
</P>
<P>
   Violent crime has been on the upswing in recent years, with
authorities publicizing campaigns against guns and wayward youths.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Laos has been troubled by guerrilla attacks in
remote central areas of the country. Ethnic Hmong insurgents have
been fighting the communist regime since it took power 25 years ago
but have rarely, if ever, staged attacks in urban areas.

<HEADLINE> Bucks 104, Clippers 85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ray Allen scored 16 of his 35 points in the
third quarter as the Milwaukee Bucks handed the Los Angeles
Clippers their ninth straight loss Thursday night, 104-85.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Cassell had 15 points and 16 assists for the Bucks, who have
won consecutive games for the first time since Jan. 29-31, when
they beat Seattle and Vancouver on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The game was the second for Milwaukee during a season-ending
13-game stretch in which it plays only twice against teams with
winning records (Portland and Charlotte). The Bucks have two games
left against the Orlando Magic, whom they trail by 1{ games for the
final Eastern Conference playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff McInnis scored a career-high 20 points for the Clippers,
who have lost 37 of 41 and have four losing streaks of nine or more
games this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have the league's worst record, 14-59. The Chicago
Bulls are 14-57.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks, who led 47-42 at halftime, broke the game open with
an 18-7 run that increased their lead to 69-53 with 4:10 left in
the third quarter. Allen scored 11 points during a four-minute
span, including a free throw after a technical foul on Clippers
interim coach Jim Todd.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Thomas extended the margin to 91-71 with a dunk and two free
throws with 6:14 remaining, and the Clippers got no closer than 12
points.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Chilcutt's 18-footer gave the Clippers the lead for the
last time, 29-28, with 7:05 left in the first half. The Bucks took
their biggest lead of the half, 39-31, on a jumper by Glenn
Robinson, a driving layup by San Cassell and a slam dunk by Ray
Allen with three minutes left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: McInnis, who signed with Los Angeles six weeks ago after
stints with Denver and Washington, was named the CBA's most
valuable player on Thursday. He averaged 19.7 points and 7.8
assists in 41 games with the Quad City Thunder. ... Tyrone Nesby
started at small forward for the Clippers and had 17 points in 43
minutes. ... The Bucks, who had the worst February in the
franchise's 32-year history with a 3-9 record, finished March at
6-8.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Erupts in Northern Japan  </HEADLINE>
By KAORI HITOMI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- Japan's Mount Usu volcano erupted Friday,
spewing hot rocks, gas and ash over the snowy countryside of the
country's northernmost main island. There were no immediate reports
of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Experts monitoring seismic activity of the volcano had predicted
the eruption and had already evacuated more than 11,000 nearby
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is possible that widespread damage could result from this
eruption,'' chief Cabinet spokesman Mikio Aoki said from the
government's emergency headquarters in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Date city official Kazuki Owada said the city has widened its
evacuation order to include another 548 people. All 13,000
residents in Abuta village were told to evacuate their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 51,000 people live in this town and two others near the
2,416-foot mountain, 475 miles north of Tokyo on the island of
Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
   The plume and ash rose from the western slope of the volcano
amid generally clear skies. Many townspeople rushed into the
streets to watch the eruption, which was clearly visible.
</P>
<P>
   The eruption began early Friday afternoon with a rapidly
expanding plume of white smoke rising from the volcano's crater.
The plume quickly turned darker as more ash and small debris became
mixed in. It came just hours after roads began cracking from
growing fissures on the flanks of the snowcapped mountain, early
signs of the magma swelling below the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Experts had warned residents that a major eruption could come at
any time, though the magnitude of this eruption wasn't immediately
clear.
</P>
<P>
   The meteorological agency issued an emergency warning earlier
Friday to announce that cracks on the mountain were increasing in
number and growing in length.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most eruption-prone countries, with
86 active volcanoes, according to the meteorological agency. The
agency describes an active volcano as one that has erupted at least
once over the last 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's eruption was preceded by four days of intense seismic
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Central Meteorological Agency in Tokyo said the
focus of the quakes had been increasingly shallow. Though many of
the tremors Thursday were centered at about 6 miles underground,
those before the eruption were focused just under the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of fissures on and around the mountain was also
seen as particularly ominous. The location of the cracks, found
earlier Friday, indicated the eruption would come from somewhere
other than the volcano's current crater.
</P>
<P>
   That did not appear to be the case, however, though much of the
volcano was obscured by the airborne ash. Initial reports from
military helicopters said the eruption occurred near the crater
rim.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have warned that the eruption could be followed by
landslides and mudslides caused by melting snow. Two people were
killed and 200 homes destroyed in mudslides following Usu's last
eruptions, which began in 1977 and continued for several months
into the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also were concerned that a flow of debris into a lake
on the western side of the mountain could create a wave similar to
tsunamis, which are created in the oceans by major earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has not had a fatal eruption in Japan since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   An eruption of the 4,459-foot Mount Unzen then sent avalanches
of hot rocks sweeping through the outskirts of the town of
Shimabara, in southern Japan, killing 43 people and leaving nearly
2,300 homeless.

<HEADLINE> Harvard Tops Graduate School Ranking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Harvard University's graduate schools in
education and medicine are the nation's best and its business
school shares the highest honor with Stanford University, according
to U.S. News &AMP; World Report's latest rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's 2001 edition of ''Best Graduate Schools''
identified Yale University as the top law school, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology as the best engineering school and the
University of Washington as the best nursing school.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine based its rankings on entering students' test
scores, faculty-to-student ratios and school reputations in
academia and the working world. It also considered measures such as
starting salary for business graduates and rates at which law
graduates pass the bar. The guides go on sale April 3.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, some universities challenge the ratings or the
methodology. The magazine encourages students to consider more than
the ranking alone, and to further research schools by considering
size, cost, location -- and their own ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings:
</P>
<P>
   --Among law schools, 1) Yale, 2) Stanford, 3) Harvard, 4) New
York University, 5) Columbia University, 6) University of Chicago,
7) University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, 8) University of
California-Berkeley and University of Virginia (tied), 10) Cornell
University.
</P>
<P>
   --Among business schools, 1) Harvard and Stanford (tie), 3)
University of Pennsylvania, 4) Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, 5) Northwestern University, 6) Columbia and University
of Chicago (tie), 8) Duke, 9) University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, 10)
UC-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   --Among medical schools, 1) Harvard, 2) Johns Hopkins, 3)
University of Pennsylvania, 4) Washington University, 5) Columbia,
6) Duke, 7) University of California-San Francisco, 8) Yale, 9)
University of Washington, 10) Stanford and University of
California-Los Angeles (tie).
</P>
<P>
   -- Among engineering schools, 1) MIT, 2) Stanford, 3)
UC-Berkeley, 4) Georgia Institute of Technology and University of
Michigan-Ann Arbor (tie), 6) California Institute of Technology and
University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign (tie), 8) Carnegie Mellon,
9) Cornell, Purdue-West Lafayette and University of Texas (tie).
</P>
<P>
   -- Among nursing schools, 1) University of Washington, 2) UC-San
Francisco and University of Pennsylvania (tie), 4) University of
Michigan-Ann Arbor, 5) Johns Hopkins and University of North
Carolina-Chapel Hill (tie), 7) Case Western Reserve University,
Oregon Health Sciences University and University of
Illinois-Chicago, 10) University of Colorado Health Sciences
Center.
</P>
<P>
   -- Among education schools, 1) Harvard, 2) Stanford, 3) Columbia,
4) UC-Berkeley, 5) UC-Los Angeles, 6) Vanderbilt University, 7)

<HEADLINE> Maryland Close to Gun Lock Law  </HEADLINE>
By SETH HETTENA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Maryland is a few legislative steps away
from becoming the first state in the nation to require built-in
locks on all new handguns. Opponents aren't sitting still.
</P>
<P>
   A National Rifle Association advertisement featuring Gov. Parris
Glendening fumbling to open one of the locks was to begin airing
today statewide, coinciding with a crucial vote before a divided
House committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial, the narrator asks: ''If your family's safety
is threatened, how much time will you have to unlock the firearm
you depend on for protection?''
</P>
<P>
   The ad uses footage from a press conference earlier this month
when Glendening spent nearly two minutes struggling to open a
push-button combination lock on a handgun. His ''childproof gun''
bill would require similar locks on all new handguns sold in the
state, beginning in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening conceded that he should have had some training with
the device before attempting a demonstration, but insisted the
locks themselves are effective.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lock worked perfectly. What didn't work is my knowledge
that I had to release the safety on the gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has been by far the most controversial piece of
legislation in the 2000 session, which draws to a close in less
than two weeks. The fight is holding up other major items,
including the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening signaled victory in the seesaw battle Thursday,
saying he had the votes to get his bill over the few hurdles that
remain.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the bill prohibits anyone convicted of a
violent crime as a juvenile from possessing a handgun until age 30
and requires gun manufacturers to provide a ballistic fingerprint
of shell casings of all new guns.
</P>
<P>
   Both President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have praised
the measure, leading Republicans to accuse the governor, a Democrat
who leaves office in 2003, of advancing a flawed bill to curry
favor with the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's putting the citizens of this state at huge, huge risk for
own political gain,'' said Delegate Carmen Amedori, one of six
Republican members of the House Judiciary committee, which was
expected to vote on the bill today.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening has attempted to make Maryland a leader in fitting
guns with technology permitting them to be fired only by their
owners. He has compared the effort to the push for air bags, which
followed government regulations imposed on the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   The bill narrowly emerged from the Senate on Monday after the
governor agreed to drop a far-reaching provision calling for
electronic ''smart gun'' locks capable of recognizing an owner
through a fingerprint.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that concession by the governor, it took rare
parliamentary maneuvering to bypass Senate conservatives and force
the bill to a floor vote.
</P>
<P>
   To guarantee passage before the session ends April 10, the bill
needs to sail as is through the committee and the full House next
week. Any amendments would send the measure back to the Senate,
where opponents might be able to mount a successful filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Amedori said she is pinning her hopes on voting to attach
anything to the bill, even if she didn't like it, ''if it would
change one comma.''
</P>
<P>
   Some committee members, including supporters of a strong gun
control bill, believe the Senate bill is so vague that a gun safety
would qualify as a locking device. The Maryland Attorney General's
office said this week after a review that a safety lever would not
suffice.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure the bill comes out untouched, the governor admitted he
has made deals with individual legislators, doling out promises of
money for community projects and school construction funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will use the full resources of my office to save the lives
of our children,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Closes Nursing Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- A nursing home was closed amid
allegations that homeless drug addicts terrorized staff and elderly
residents after arriving from Chicago to fill beds at the
financially troubled center.
</P>
<P>
   John Lumpkin, Illinois public health director, said the
suspension of the Lexington Nursing and Rehabilitation Center's
license was necessary because of an ''immediate and serious
threat'' to residents' safety.
</P>
<P>
   The agency closed the home Monday night, moving all 26 residents
elsewhere. The home, which was only half full, received an average
of $75 a day per patient in state and federal reimbursements, the
Chicago Tribune reported. The home's owners had brought the addicts
in.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department spokesman Thomas Schafer said one staff member
was attacked by a drug patient and another worker was injured when
a patient jumped on the worker's back.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, one of the drug patients tried to slash the
throat of another after they returned from drinking at a bar,
Lexington Police Chief Spencer Johansen said.

<P>
   Schafer said the home's other residents felt intimidated by the
drug treatment patients, who ranged in age from 21 to 46.
</P>
<P>
   The drug patients told police they had agreed to go to the home
in the quiet town about 100 miles southwest of Chicago after being
promised substance abuse treatment, use of a swimming pool and
horseback riding.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the patients, who came from a Chicago shelter,
arrived to find no pool, a horse across the street that hadn't been
ridden in years and no drug treatment program.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have identified the Chicago-area owners of the
nursing home as Richard Benkin, Michael Weis, Joel Gross and Lee
Cotton.
</P>
<P>
   ''The facility intends to contest this matter and adamantly
denies any justification for the department's actions,'' they said
in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Clergy leaves meeting when Safir refuses to apologize for policeshooting  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Police Commissioner Howard Safir's refusal to
apologize for the death of Patrick Dorismond and for releasing his
sealed juvenile record abruptly ended a meeting he had called with
Brooklyn clergy members.
</P>
<P>
   And when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani showed up as a surprise
last-minute guest at Police Headquarters on Thursday, the clergy
members caucused, said they weren't prepared to talk to him, and
left.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police commissioner told me he was having this meeting and
I thought it would be a good thing if I came over and talked to
them,'' Giuliani said. ''When I walked in, they apparently weren't
prepared for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 clergy members -- all part of the Community Action Project
-- were invited by Safir to discuss ways of improving police
relations in the predominantly minority communities of several
Brooklyn neighborhoods. Dorismond, the son of Haitian immigrants,
grew up in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. He was fatally shot by an
undercover police detective during a drug buy-and-bust operation in
Manhattan on March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was the fourth unarmed black man fatally shot by
police in the last 13 months. His death has sparked outrage among
minorities, especially when Giuliani authorized Safir to release
Dorismond's sealed juvenile record, just hours after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Public Advocate Mark Green filed papers
seeking a judicial inquiry into how Giuliani and Safir obtained
Dorismond's records and whether they broke the law in making them
public. A state judge has ordered Giuliani or his attorneys to
appear in court April 13 to determine whether confidentiality laws
were violated.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the 30-minute meeting began shortly after 5 p.m.
The clergy members first thanked Safir for the NYPD's efforts to
find who has been desecrating religious statues at Brooklyn
Catholic churches. Several pastors whose churches had been
vandalized attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But before any dialogue took place, the clergy members asked
Safir to apologize publicly to Dorismond's family for releasing his
sealed record and for misrepresenting his character.
</P>
<P>
   ''We told him the credibility of our negotiations hinges on his
acceptance to give an apology to mark a new beginning,'' said
Monsignor Guy Sansaricq, pastor of St. Jerome's Catholic Church.
''We certainly expected for him to admit there was some mistakes
made.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Safir said: ''They told me they wanted an apology,
and they wanted an apology by this Sunday for the Dorismond
killing, is the way they described it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I told them I had great sympathy for Mrs. Dorismond. . .I was
perfectly willing to publicly express that sympathy and the empathy
I have with her. . .But I was not prepared to apologize for the
Dorismond incident because all the facts have not come out, and
that we need to wait until the grand jury reviewed all the facts,''
Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's comments were another recent display of a
change in tone from top city officials. Both Safir and Giuliani
have taken a softer tact when discussing the Dorismond shooting.
</P>
<P>
   A senior City Hall aide described the shift as turning the
mayor's volume dial from a ''10'' last week to a ''7'' by the end
of last weekend, and the tone would continue to drop, The New York
Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the group agreed to meet again after the grand jury
makes a decision. But clergy members stressed they would only meet
with Safir when he was ready to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Safir acknowledged that race has played a
major role in the deep divide between the NYPD and the minority
communities, adding that he will reach out to citizens to try and
bridge that gap.
</P>
<P>
   A black officers' group agreed there's a race problem in the
city, but said police tactics toward minorities are also to blame
for the disharmony, and that Safir's words are merely cosmetic.
Civil rights activists say his remarks show that Safir believes the
problem lies within the community, not police.
</P>
<P>
   ''He still believes that the Police Department is doing a pretty
good job, except that people misunderstand the police,'' said
Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights
Coalition. ''It's his way of saying there's an anti-police
prejudice out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir made his remarks at City Hall, responding to a question on
President Clinton's statement on Wednesday that with better
training and policies, crime can remain low in large cities and
community relations with the police can also improve. Clinton did
not criticize the NYPD or comment on the department's controversial
police shootings in the last 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said civilian complaints in New York City are the same as
in other large cities.
</P>
<P>
   But then he said: ''Let's face it, if we're all honest, this is
about race, it's something we have to fix, something we have to
talk to each other about. It's less about police than it is about
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Eric Adams, co-founder of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who
Care, said he's glad Safir agrees that race plays a major role in
policing.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, it's also about tactics,'' Adams said. ''Our tactics
are flawed because we have failed to take into account the racial
component of our tactics. I think today the commissioner's
statement can only be perceived as cosmetic unless he's willing to
make steps in the right direction to rectify some of the racial
components that prevent us from policing correctly.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Web Site Linked to Gambling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The NCAA, which has threatened to withhold
press credentials from newspapers that accept ads from gambling
touts, had a Web link to a basketball pool-type contest offering
more than $45,000 in prizes, the Los Angeles Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   The link on the NCAA's Final Four site,
http://www.finalfour.net, was contained in a Maxim magazine ad
directing Web surfers to a contest called Maxim Madness, the
newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA said it didn't know the link was being placed there,
adding that officials had it pulled as soon as they found out.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a flat-out error,'' NCAA spokesman Wally Renfro told
the newspaper. ''We didn't know it was going to be there and we
absolutely do not condone it.''
</P>
<P>
   Renfro said the NCAA's corporate partner, Total Sports, is
responsible for the Final Four Web site and made a separate
arrangement with Maxim.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's anti-gambling crusade has taken the organization's
officials to Washington to protest the legal betting on college
sports that takes place in Las Vegas casinos.

<HEADLINE> Texas day trader arrested for posting phony earnings warning onweb  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A Houston man was held without bail after he was
accused of issuing a bogus press release on the Internet that
prosecutors say managed to devalue communications giant Lucent
Technologies by $7.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Moldofsky, 43, was charged with securities fraud for
allegedly posting a phony earnings warning that caused the value of
the stock of the world's top manufacturer of communications
equipment to fall as much as 3.6 percent from $62.62 to $60.37.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is the latest example of our commitment to the
speedy investigation and prosecution of those who choose to use the
Internet as the medium through which to commit securities fraud,''
said U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who seek to deceive the investing public should be
forewarned that the Internet provides no anonymity and offers no
insulation from law enforcement,'' she said in a release.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged Moldofsky used phony names and addresses on
the Internet to hide the truth behind his bogus press release
posted on March 22, the same day he traded 6,000 shares of the
company's stock. Prosecutors blame Moldofsky for causing the stock
to fall $7.1 billion in value.
</P>
<P>
   Moldofsky was arrested at his home early Thursday by U.S. Postal
inspectors. Later in the day, he appeared in U.S. District Court in
Houston, where Assistant U.S. Attorney George Tallichet requested
that he be held without bail as a risk of flight. Moldofsky agreed
to remain in custody until a bail hearing in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A federal defender assigned to represent Moldofsky in Houston
did not immediately return a telephone message.
</P>
<P>
   The bogus Internet release alleged that the former division of
AT&AMP;T expected its operating results for its second fiscal quarter
of 2000 to be lower than analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The fake announcement was made at a time when companies
typically issue any warnings about their earnings prior to the
actual earnings reports later in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Murray Hill, N.J., company actually had warned
that its earnings would fall short of expectations, causing
analysts to slash estimates and the value of the company's stock to
fall.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, U.S. Postal Inspector Thomas F.X. Feeney said
the phony posting was made on an electronic bulletin board attached
to the Web site entitled, ''Yahoo? Finance.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeney said a Yahoo user identified as ''hot like wasabe''
posted a message at 6:57 p.m. captioned, ''LUCENT RELEASES EARNINGS
WARNING! DAMN!''
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the message was the phony news release, Feeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Between March 22 and March 23, a user identifying himself with a
screen name that mimicked the name of someone who regularly gives
stock advice on the Internet posted messages such as ''LUCENT
Warns!'' ''We're all doomed tomorrow!'' and ''LUCENT WARNS! I'm
going to cut my throat.'' Each of the messages, he said, allowed
readers to connect to the bogus news release.
</P>
<P>
   Feeney said the wording of the phony news release was similar to
that of a Jan. 6 news release in which Lucent announced that its
first quarter earnings would be lower than analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Feeney said he eventually tracked down the man who posted the
bogus news release as an American Online user identifying himself
online as ''WALLSTREETWEEK.'' In a home page, Moldofsky said he was
a full-time online stock investor, according to the investigator.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Moldofsky could face up to 10 years in prison and
a fine of $1 million or twice the gross gain or loss resulting from
the crime.

<HEADLINE> Annual Clown Convention in Canada  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Peering down her bright red nose, Linda Berman --
aka Heart Throb -- stamped a gargantuan shoe to make an important
point about bubble blowing during her seminar at the World Clown
Association annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's absolutely no end to the amount of fun,'' she said,
''and you can make a LOT (pause) OF (pause) MONEY.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman was talking about how a clown can use soap bubbles at a
party -- but she could have been talking about the convention
itself: a gathering of practitioners of one of the oldest forms of
entertainment to share secrets on how to keep 'em laughing and make
a profit.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 clowns, mostly from North America and the United
Kingdom, converged on Toronto's downtown Holiday Inn for the
four-day convention that opened Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the meeting was easy -- just follow the clowns. While
some of the delegates attended sessions in street clothes, others
chose to wear the most recognized tools of their trade: painted
faces, colored wigs, baggy pants and of course, the giant shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Feen, president of the 4,000-member association, said the
convention offers a lot to those who pay $125 to attend. Seminars
covered everything from storytelling, magic and balloon-making to
clown history and religious-themed performance. Competitions for
balloon-making, makeup, wardrobe and performing skills will be
held.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the camaraderie, it's the educational value, fine-tuning
the skills you already have,'' said Feen, dressed as her
professional alter ego -- Giggles -- in a flowing pink top beneath a
garish striped costume, her face expertly painted and topped by a
metallic blue wig.
</P>
<P>
   A former schoolteacher, she got into clowning 19 years ago out
of disappointment over a performer at her daughter's birthday
party. Now she runs Giggles Entertainment in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
handling corporate events for IBM, Marriott, Hewlett-Packard and
others.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a phenomenal occupation. It's taken me all around the
world,'' she said. ''I'm an ambassador of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the seminars focused on the business side of clowning.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, who works out of Pasadena, Calif., gushed to the two
dozen people sitting in chairs around her plastic wading pool about
the benefits of including bubble-making at children's parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes an enormous amount of money from soap, water and
air,'' she said, in full regalia, from purple wig to blue clown
shoes. ''It requires absolutely no skill.''
</P>
<P>
   No skill, maybe, but Berman knows her bubbles. Her lecture notes
provide 12 recipes for bubble water, some including white corn
syrup or glycerin to prevent evaporation in dry conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Bubble implements are everywhere, she told the listeners,
showing how a clothes net and even the plastic holder off a
six-pack make excellent bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   The convention also provides retailers the chance to demonstrate
clowning wares. George Kondiles, 47, of Funny Feet Fashion stood
behind a table of the orthopedically sound clown shoes that can
cost $200 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   ''The shoes are engineered so that every biomechanical motion
that you have when you walk ... works the same,'' said Kondiles, a
certified maker of orthopedic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clowns are the most giving, the most loving, the most
sharing'' people around, he said. ''I think it's part of the nature
of being a clown. ... When they put on that face, it brings it out
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Feen said the thrill of performing and the desire to make money
motivates all clowns.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the really good entertainers,'' she added, ''it's from the
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how well a top-notch professional clown does, she rolled
back her billowy sleeve to display a sparkling golden watch.
''Honey, it's a real Rolex.''

<HEADLINE> Gore: Keep Elian in U.S. for Now  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore wants Elian Gonzalez's
case resolved in Florida family court, a position that puts him at
odds with the administration he serves but in step with South
Florida's politically potent Cuban exile community.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, the presumptive Democratic presidential
nominee urged Congress to pass legislation granting permanent
resident status not only to the 6-year-old boy but to his father,
stepmother, stepbrother, grandmothers and grandfather -- all now in
Cuba -- ''so that the case can be adjudicated properly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has demanded that the
boy's Miami relatives agree to release him if they lose an appeal
to keep him in the country. Most Cuban-Americans living in the
Miami area strongly oppose administration efforts to return Elian
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's announcement took top congressional Democrats by
surprise. House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt had no immediate
reaction. An aide said Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle
continues to believe that ''the boy should be returned to his
father in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, called Gore's announcement an ''11th-hour position.'' Bush
said in January that he supported such legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad the vice president has seen the wisdom of the way,''
Bush said Thursday in Milwaukee. ''What he ought to do is convince
the attorney general and the president to accept the same position.
... We'll see what kind of influence he has in this
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas, said Gore ''now has an
obligation to work with us to keep Elian Gonzalez in the United
States.'' Delay said he welcomed Gore's statement, whether it was
reached ''through his concern for the Electoral College or as a
genuine matter of conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida has 25 electoral votes, the fourth-largest prize
available on Election Day. The state was initially thought to be
favorable to Bush, since his brother, Jeb, is governor. But Gore
has increased his campaigning there if for no other reason than to
force Bush to spend time and money in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was left stranded on an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day
after his mother and 10 others drowned while trying to flee Cuba
for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has pushed back until early next week its deadline for
revoking Elian's right to stay in the United States if his Miami
relatives refuse to agree to turn him over. A lawyer for Elian's
father, meanwhile, said he was applying for visas so the family in
Cuba could retrieve him.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Gore has been distancing himself from the
administration on the issue, saying previously he felt the case
would be best resolved in Florida family court.
</P>
<P>
   He formally broke ranks by announcing his support for
legislation introduced by Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla. A similar bill
has been filed by Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J. Bush, meanwhile,
supports similar legislation introduced by Graham's colleague, Sen.
Connie Mack, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us be clear that the real fault in this case lies with the
oppressive regime of Fidel Castro,'' the vice president said in the
statement. ''Elian should never have been forced to choose between
freedom and his own father. Now we must take action, here on our
own shores, to make sure that Elian's best interests are served.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters in Wisconsin, Bush repeated that the boy
and his father should be allowed to remain in the United States
while the case is decided in Florida family court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope if Mr. Gonzalez does come over, that he come over
as a person who's able to make a decision based on his desire, that
he be given a chance to feel in America what freedom means before
he makes any decision, and that decision be made in a family
court,'' Bush said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Looking At Gas Tax Rollback  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first hurdle is out of the way, but
supporters of legislation that would temporarily roll back 4.3
cents of the federal gas tax still face strong opposition from most
Democrats and some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the bill passes the Senate in the coming weeks, it faces
uncertain prospects in the House and even proponents acknowledge it
offers modest relief at the gas pump at best. Still, Republican
backers say it's better than nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It represents us doing something and the administration doing
nothing,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, are
making the issue prime election-year fodder, referring to it as the
''Gore tax'' because Vice President Al Gore cast the 1993
tie-breaking Senate vote increase the gas tax by 4.3 cents a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush favors ''efforts to
lower gas prices'' but is still reviewing the temporary repeal,
spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Substantive action on the measure was put off until next week at
the earliest, despite an 86-11 Senate vote Thursday to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats and some Republicans who oppose the repeal could
have tried to muster the votes to kill the bill outright. But
instead of being put on record as opposing a tax rollback, they
opted to let the bill remain alive, giving themselves time to offer
alternatives or amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could not be more strongly in opposition to repealing the
gas tax,'' said Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ''I think this
ought to be debated.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation pushed by Lott, R-Miss., would eliminate the
4.3-cent-a-gallon tax for the rest of the year and suspend the
entire 18.4-cent federal gas tax until January if average prices
for regular unleaded gas top $2 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to do something on an immediate basis so people aren't
hammered,'' Lott argued.
</P>
<P>
   The debate came a few days after the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to boost production by 1.7
million barrels of oil a day, which could trigger a slow price
decline to follow the recent drop from $34 a barrel a few weeks ago
to $26.45 a barrel this week. U.S. officials say the crude price
could drop another $2.50 a barrel by late summer.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents to Lott's bill, including many Republicans, said the
proposal would jeopardize about $7 billion a year in money for
highway, bridge and mass transit projects that are high priorities
on Capitol Hill. Lott, however, said his bill would replace the
lost money out of projected budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics said the tax relief would be too meager -- a
motorist who drove 12,000 miles a year at 20 miles per gallon would
realize savings of only $26 -- and there was no way to guarantee
that oil companies would actually pass the tax cut on to consumers.
Democrats said blaming Gore, the presumptive 2000 Democratic
presidential nominee, appeared to be the GOP's main intent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reducing the price of fuel by 4.3 cents a gallon for part of
the year isn't the answer,'' said Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev. ''It's
quite clear that repeal of the gas tax is really an effort to make
a political statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Democrats talked about reducing U.S. dependence on
foreign oil, a renewed push for energy efficiency and better
development of alternatives such as solar power, Republicans
contend the long-term answer is a series of tax breaks to boost
U.S. production, opening more federal lands to oil exploration and
a get-tough negotiating stance with OPEC.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Research: Genetic Errors Cause Aging  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A failure of quality control in genes may be
the underlying reason for the physical decline that inevitably
accompanies aging, according to new research.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published today in the journal Science, researchers
at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., said that a
survey of 6,000 genes uncovered at least 61 that go through
dramatic changes from the age of 9 to 90.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard A. Lerner, a co-author of the study, said he
believes it is these genetic changes that imprint the body with the
typical signals of aging -- gray hair, wrinkled skin, weaker muscles
and brittle bones.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are checkpoint genes that have to do with quality
control in a cell,'' said Lerner. ''These genes decide after a cell
divides if it is good enough to live or not.''
</P>
<P>
   If the checkpoint genes work, then genetic errors are stopped
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But when the checkpoint genes fail, mistakes in DNA are
perpetuated because the flawed cells then make new cells with the
same genetic mistakes, or worse. This cascade of genetic goofs can
eventually cause a loss of function that may include the typical
symptoms of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, said Lerner, it is the ''mismanagement'' of these
checkpoint genes ''that is responsible for aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner said the study eventually could lead to finding ways of
controlling the aging process. But, for now, the work just gives
science a new understanding of why all people suffer from what he
called a common disease -- aging.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an extremely interesting piece of work,'' said Dr.
Leonard Guarente, a researcher of aging at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, ''but it is not a breakthrough. It just
gives a hint'' of a possible aging process, and ''a suggestion of
an area that should be looked into.''
</P>
<P>
   Guarente said that the study used only laboratory cell lines and
that further research is needed to show that the changes found in
the lab work actually occur in living human beings. Until that is
done, he said, nothing has been proven by the research.
</P>
<P>
   In the Scripps study, Lerner and his colleagues used a gene
analysis system called microarrays to monitor the activity of genes
in differently aged cells.
</P>
<P>
   They used cells donated from the tissue of patients as young as
nine and as old as 90, along with cells from patients with
progeria, a disorder of highly accelerated aging and premature
death.
</P>
<P>
   The cells were put into four groups: the normal young, the
normal middle-aged, the normal old and the progeria patients.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner said the researchers found a consistent pattern of
growing impairment in specific genes when comparing the cells of
the young, middle-aged and old. The impairment found in the
progeria cells, he said, closely matched those in the very old.
</P>
<P>
   It is a normal function of the body to replace old cells with
new cells. This is done by the process of division -- an old cell
divides and creates two new cells. Each cell gets full copies of
the chromosomes from the old cell.
</P>
<P>
   But Lerner said his study suggests the aging process involves
mistakes in the transfer of chromosomes and genes from the old
cells to the new cells, and the failure of quality control genes to
find and fix these mistakes, or to eliminate the bad cells.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the changes caused genes to stop working, while other
changes caused an ''up regulation,'' or increased activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows that as we get older, altered gene expression
results in production of cells with diminished function,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Genes linked to the common physical manifestations of aging --
gray hair, wrinkled skin, reduced function of some organs -- are all
sensitive to changes in their structure, said Lerner.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, quality control among bone marrow cells
can become so flawed that it perpetuates bad genes, even to the
extent that whole chromosomes may be missing in cells.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time you are 90, a huge percentage of your cells in the
bone marrow have missing chromosomes,'' said Lerner. This could
help explain such things the brittle bones common among the aged,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher said his findings, if verified by other
scientists, put a new perspective on the process of aging and
suggest that it shares some of cancer's characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you had asked before what aging is like and what cancer is
like, people would have said that cancer is a disease of abnormal
cell replication and aging is a disease where the cell wears out,''
said Lerner. ''Our study suggests that aging and cancer are really
quite similar -- they are both caused by a failure of certain
quality control genes.''

<HEADLINE> Dietary Supplement Claims Debated  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- From strong modern vitamins to the
traditional comfort of herbal teas, health experts are debating
whether dietary supplements should be allowed to claim benefits for
pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   Some worry about another thalidomide tragedy, a repeat of the
deformed babies of four decades ago whose mothers took the
anti-nausea drug.
</P>
<P>
   But others fear that too many warnings could frighten
mothers-to-be away from supplements of proven value such as
vitamins and folic acid.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration, which must decide what the
supplements can claim on their labels, hosted a jammed hotel
ballroom here Thursday to hear conflicting evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Some speakers warned of possible hidden dangers in products that
do not have to face government regulation or the extensive testing
of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The notion that dietary supplements are safe may be debated,
but when it comes to the fetus we do not know,'' Allen A. Mitchell
of Boston University told the panel, urging a ban on all claims
relating to pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Jan M. Friedman of the University of British Columbia added that
just because something is natural or has been used for many years
doesn't necessarily mean it's safe.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging from exotic herbs like cat's claw and blessed thistle to
better known vitamins and minerals, dietary supplements have become
among the nation's biggest sellers in recent years. Sales nearly
doubled from $3.3 billion in 1990 to $6.5 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At one time medical students were taught there was no evidence
that alcohol was hazardous for a fetus, since it had been used for
thousands of years, he said. ''We didn't know about fetal alcohol
syndrome because it hadn't been studied,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald R. Mattison of the March of Dimes Birth Defects
Foundation opposed allowing supplements to be promoted for such
things as morning sickness and leg swelling.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that it may be hard for an expectant mother to tell
the difference between ordinary nausea and swelling that are part
of pregnancy and more severe forms that can be a sign of serious
illness.
</P>
<P>
   But makers of herbal and chemical supplements argued that their
products are safe and carefully labeled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Products that have a centuries-long tradition of providing
comfort to women should be allowed to continue providing that
comfort,'' said Michael McGuffin of the American Herbal Products
Association, citing peppermint tea and ginger products as examples.
</P>
<P>
   Of more than 640 herbal products listed by his association, more
than 200 already carry cautions against use by pregnant or nursing
women, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. R. William Soller of the Consumer Healthcare Products
Association said his organization this week adopted a voluntary
program of labeling most supplements with a warning that pregnant
or nursing women should check with a health professional.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions, he said, include such things as multivitamins
and folic acid which are of proven value in pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Rules announced in January by FDA would have permitted
supplements to claim usefulness for such things as morning sickness
and swelling of the legs, considered a normal part of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency backed off after receiving complaints that some
supplements could be harmful to pregnant women and their unborn
children. It directed the manufacturers not to make any claims
until it could restudy the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Congress banned the FDA from regulating the manufacture or sale
of supplements, but it can insist that labels be truthful. Health
claims can be made only if they meet criteria set by the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   In the rules for supplements announced in January, the agency
said it would allow claims related to the normal
''structure-function'' of the body without prior review. These
include such claims as ''calcium builds strong bones,'' and ''fiber
maintains bowel regularity.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a statement that a supplement can treat, cure
or ease a specific disease would mean it is claiming to be a drug
and would not be allowed without approval.

<HEADLINE> Debate Over Heart of Fragmented LA  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There is no Central Park, Gateway Arch or
Golden Gate Bridge. It sprawls 467 square miles, a third larger
than New York City, but has no single monument that says: ''This is
Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's absence of a core institution or defining symbol --
there's no pro football team, not even a bad one -- is highlighted
by the pending sale of Times Mirror Co. and the proposed sale of
Atlantic Richfield Co.
</P>
<P>
   The two are the last two Fortune 500 companies in the city's
business district, and their imminent flight has stirred debate
over the role and future of the city's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly is much less of a first-class competitor in many
ways than it was a decade ago,'' said Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow
with the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Mirror and Arco deals come at a time when the region
is remaking itself as a center for trade and technology.
</P>
<P>
   That evolution was demonstrated this week when a Texas company
announced it will refurbish the historic Terminal Annex post office
near downtown into a high-tech village housing up to 50 Internet
companies and as many as 1,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based Infomart plans to spend $60 million to convert the
62-year-old building into offices with high-speed transmission
lines attractive to Internet-based companies.
</P>
<P>
   Such change foreshadows a future in which major corporate
headquarters become less relevant to a region that is so culturally
and economically diverse that it doesn't need a central core, said
Sky Dayton, the 28-year-old founder of Earthlink, an Internet
service provider based in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Those who say Los Angeles is in danger of becoming a second-rate
metropolis are missing the point, Dayton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fortune 500s are great, but we're in the middle of an
industrial revolution here that is 20 percent over,'' Dayton said.
''New empires are going to be created, and I think it's kind of
cool to not have these old, monolithic companies here, which just
makes room for us, for all these Internet companies to be
created.''
</P>
<P>
   Other major urban centers fit more easily into the traditional
notion of a big city. Chicago with its downtown Loop or Manhattan
with Times Square and Central Park are the focal points of regional
identity and power.
</P>
<P>
   Not Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''This city is so large and spread out ... there is no center,''
said Larry Mascari, who for two decades owned downtown's Redwood
House Restaurant and Bar.
</P>
<P>
   It's a phenomenon rooted in history.
</P>
<P>
   When the Pueblo de los Angeles was founded in 1781, it was one
of two focal points of Spanish settlement in Southern California.
The other was the mission at San Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Los Angeles is a sprawling matrix of suburbs and
satellite shopping centers, characterized by growing ethnic
populations, all interconnected by a serpentine system of freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Its attractions are far-flung, from the Hollywood sign to the
Coliseum to Disneyland to Universal City to the new Getty Center,
all of which are outside downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Power, wealth and influence radiate from Santa Monica, Beverly
Hills, the San Fernando Valley and Irvine. Even without Arco and
Times Mirror, the region is home to nearly two dozen Fortune 500
companies, including the Walt Disney Co. in Burbank and Pacificare
Health Systems in Santa Ana.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you find is a lot of people viewing the Times and now
Arco going as rather ominous,'' said Jack A. Kyser, chief economist
for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. ''But
downtown is on the verge of a new role. It will not be a
traditional downtown, but it will be the center of a lot of
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the long run, I think it's going to hurt us,'' said
Nobuyuki Watanabe, who runs a gift shop and jewelry store in the
city's Little Tokyo section. ''If those companies are going to go
away, less people will be working downtown.''

<HEADLINE> Ahern Leads The Tradition  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- During the 1999 Tradition, Jim Ahern
was conducting a corporate golf outing.
</P>
<P>
   That was early in a Senior PGA rookie season that turned out
well, but not well enough to get invited this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to go through Monday qualifying, and it's tough,'' Ahern
said Thursday after shooting a 7-under-par 65 in the first round.
''But it can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern is proof of that. His eight-birdie, one-bogey round tied
his career-best score and sent him into the second round with a
1-stroke lead over Tom Kite and Walter Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of others were close as the Cochise Course at
Desert Mountain, set up for a major, played tougher than Ahern
could remember.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pretty long, but it's the longest I've ever seen this
course play. And if you drive it in the rough, you're busy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Nelson was alone in fourth at 68, with Jay Sigel, Bob
Dickson and Vicente Fernandez at 69.
</P>
<P>
   Kite had the second-best round of his rookie season, but other
noted players had problems.
</P>
<P>
   Four-time winner Jack Nicklaus, who designed the course, was
eight shots back in a group that also included two-time Tradition
champion Gil Morgan, defending champion Graham Marsh and Seniors
rookie Lanny Wadkins.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Fleisher, the only player to win two titles this year,
shot 74, and Hale Irwin, who won 21 times in three previous
seasons, continued his 2000 struggles with a 4-over 76.
</P>
<P>
   While others were making headlines on the PGA Tour, Ahern made
the fine print, playing in 60 events from 1973-75 without finishing
higher than ninth.
</P>
<P>
   When he lost his tour card, he considered it a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't belong out there, but I think I belong out here
now,'' he said about his improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern worked as the head pro at the Des Moines Golf and Country
Club, and founded Executive Golf Ltd. in 1985, overseeing 100-guest
outings 8-10 weeks a year.
</P>
<P>
   But he kept his eye on the seniors tour and played in 16 events
last year after he turned 50 in February. He picked his spots, won
the Canada Senior Open and earned $478,963.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he got reacquainted with the blahs -- his best
finish in seven tournaments was a tie for 13th -- until the
Tradition, sponsored by Countrywide.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied the second and third holes with long putts, bogeyed
No. 4, but got it going again on No. 5, where he chipped in from 30
yards. Ahern broke out of a three-way tie with Kite and Morgan with
his last birdie on No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   He drove to the edge of another wash, leaving himself a 92-yard
shot that landed within 12 feet, and finessed the putt into the
cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really can't say I'm surprised, because I have been playing
well,'' Ahern said. ''It's nice to have those scores, though. When
those putts don't go in, a day like today is maybe a 69 or 70.''
</P>
<P>
   Kite had three birdies on each side.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the first round I've had where I haven't made a bogey
in ... forever,'' said the winner of 19 regular tour events. ''I'd
hate to even guess how long it's been.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who didn't play the PGA Tour because of a 20-year Army
career, also made six birdies in a bogey-free round. But he made
all of them on the back nine in an extraordinary surge that
included three putts longer than 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough for a guy who never won on the regular tour, so
I've got to do it out here,'' Morgan said.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Killers Break Silence  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- By his own admission, as an
enthusiastic Tutsi militiaman, Emile had killed enough Hutus to
make him feel uncomfortable around most people.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't much I have to say to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So the strong, quiet 28-year-old with a broad smile and a firm
handshake found friendship with someone who understood his past --
but from the other side of Burundi's civil conflict. Now, he shares
beer, cigarettes and cracks a few jokes with Victor, a disheveled
veteran of the seven-year Hutu rebellion against Burundi's
Tutsi-dominated government.
</P>
<P>
   Like Emile, Victor feels betrayed and used by teachers and
parents who taught them to hate their neighbors and shy away from
possible friends just because they were Hutu or Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are hypocrites. They told us to kill and chase away Hutus
or Tutsis, while they stayed together, did business together and
still live together,'' said Emile, who like Victor would not allow
his last name to be used.
</P>
<P>
   The hatred ripping apart this tiny central African nation, best
known for its high-quality tea and coffee, has left more than
200,000 people dead -- both Hutus and Tutsis -- since 1993. In
October of that year, thousands of Hutus took up arms after Tutsi
paratroopers assassinated the country's first democratically
elected president, a Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   When former South African President Nelson Mandela stepped in
last year to mediate peace talks, hopes rose for a political
solution. Proposals include integration of Hutu rebels into the
Tutsi-dominated army and elections to choose a new government.
</P>
<P>
   But news from the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, where the
negotiations have dragged on for the past 20 months, seem to have
little effect on life in this laid-back capital on Lake Tanganyika.
</P>
<P>
   In Bujumbura, progress is measured not by how many politicians
attend the talks but by the growing number of contacts between
people across the ethnic divide.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the bottom, this war is not about ethnicity, it's straight
interest,'' said Adrian Tuyoga, a founder of Jamaa -- or ''Friends''
in Kiswahili -- a Burundian organization that brings together former
fighters from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Although they share the same language, land and culture, Hutus,
who make up the majority of the 6.5 million Burundians, and Tutsis
remain divided by economic differences and the unofficial
segregation that has developed after so many confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after independence from Belgium in 1962, the Tutsi
minority took over the armed forces following a botched
Hutu-orchestrated coup. Since then, years of massacres of Hutus and
revenge killings of Tutsis are recited like mantras by one side or
another -- 1965, 1971, 1972, 1988, 1993 -- and used against any move
towards rapprochement. Similar massacres have killed hundreds of
thousands of people in Rwanda, Burundi's northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look. I didn't profit from any of the killings. I was poor
before, and I am poor now,'' Emile told Victor. ''You're just like
me. They told us to kill, and now we have to pick up the pieces --
not them.''
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the men have been meeting every day under a
tree behind an unfinished house off the capital's main boulevard,
discussing past wars and the future with a dozen other men, who
like them have abandoned the ranks of the Tutsi army and militia
and the Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
   All are unemployed. Many are haunted by visions of killings and
the faces of their victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''Emile killed many Hutus. Most of them intellectuals, but also
women and children. He feels remorse now. All of them do,'' said
Tuyoga.
</P>
<P>
   Playing soccer and drinking beer have strengthened ties between
the two groups. But the young men of Jamaa want more: funds to tell
their story and to encourage their peers to abandon their guns and
machetes and start talking to each other.
</P>
<P>
   After four years fighting for the National Liberation Front, one
of the most active Hutu rebel groups, Victor now says there was
nothing political about swinging a machete at Tutsis he didn't even
know.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was fighting for people in power. The rebel leaders were
staying in Tanzania or Nairobi, occasionally visiting or sending us
weapons. But there was no ideology behind our fight. Just interest
of individuals who told us to kill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Victor believes he can recruit hundreds of Hutu fighters
still ambushing vehicles, attacking army positions or just hunting
for food and shelter, and get them safely back to civilian life.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to see there is an alternative,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the group has enjoyed the tacit support of political
leaders and even their families. But unresolved questions of
amnesty and the prosecution of those responsible for the killings
hover.
</P>
<P>
   Victor and Emile grew up next door to each other in what is now
the heavily damaged Kamenge neighborhood, where people have started
returning to rebuild their homes and their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Emile returned to a neighborhood bar for the first time this
month. To the amazement of people dancing to a popular Burundian
tune, he braved his fear and walked in with Victor and other
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, people started coming up to their table. Some offered
drinks, some shook hands, others exchanged words and hugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realized we have no problem among ourselves,'' Emile said.
''We have problem with politicians, and we're now able to protect
each other.''

<HEADLINE> Stankowski Leads Bellsouth Classic  </HEADLINE>
By ED SHEARER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DULUTH, Ga. (AP) -- Paul Stankowski loves Atlanta, for good
reason.
</P>
<P>
   He has only two victories since joining the PGA Tour in 1994,
and one of those came in the BellSouth Classic at the Atlanta
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   He's back again this week, and although it's on a different
course, Stankowski found himself with a 1-shot lead in the
unfinished first round.
</P>
<P>
   ''I loved Atlanta, a lot of great memories, and I'd like to win
again,'' Stankowski said after shooting a 6-under-par 66 Thursday
on the hilly TPC at Sugarloaf layout.
</P>
<P>
   He finished his round about an hour before play was suspended by
darkness with 39 players still on the course. A suspension of
almost two hours early in the morning because of lightning caused
the field to get backed up throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Stankowski said he's probably more comfortable at Sugarloaf than
he was at the Atlanta Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fairways here are very generous, so I don't complain too much
when we play golf courses like Muirfield Village or here,'' he
said. ''I like the place. The golf course is a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He played a bogey-free round, getting three birdies on each
nine, with half of his birdie putts in the 4-6 foot range to go
with a 25-footer on No. 2, a 15-footer on No. 12 and a 30-footer on
the 13th.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't hit the ball really well,'' he said. ''I struggled
with the driver, but the fairways are so big and there's not a
whole lot of rough. It was one of those days that could have been a
72 in a heartbeat, but I am thankful it was not.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was more like my 'D' game, but it was my 'A' putting game.
I rolled it well. I chipped it well. It was fun to get the ball in
the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   He held his 1-shot advantage over a half-dozen golfers headed by
Phil Mickelson, who won the Buick Invitational earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Mickelson at 67 were Kenny Perry, Blaine McCallister,
Steve Jones, Jay Don Blake and Jean Van de Velde, the French golfer
playing his ninth event in the United States as he prepares for the
Masters next week.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price headed a group at 68 that also included Gary
Nicklaus, son of Jack Nicklaus. Gary has missed five cuts in nine
tournaments this year, with his best finish a tie for 28th in the
Honda Classic. His round included an eagle 3 on the 541-yard fourth
hole when he chipped in from 40 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the best ball-striking round I had all year,'' Nicklaus
said. ''I missed only two or three shots all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Also finishing at 68 were Joey Sindelar, Gabriel Hjertstedt,
Dave Stockton Jr., John Huston, Brian Henninger, David Peoples and
Tom Scherrer, who completed his final hole after play was suspended
at 6:59 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion David Duval struggled to a 73. Paul Azinger
led a group of nine at 69, defending Masters champion Jose Maria
Olazabal shot 71 and Justin Leonard 72.

<HEADLINE> Gore Team Eyes Governor  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- When Gov. Gray Davis wanted more
federal aid for California public schools last year, he picked up
the phone and called Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed it again aboard Air Force Two and Gore delivered
a few months later, announcing $129 million in aid to help reduce
class sizes in upper grades in California.
</P>
<P>
   After two decades of friendship, these longtime public servants
have a symbiotic personal and political relationship that has made
Davis an appealing prospective running mate for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the first-term governor repeatedly has said, in the
strongest possible terms, that he is not interested in the job.
He's even dismissed the vice presidency as a mere advisory role.
</P>
<P>
   The message, however, hasn't sunk in among Gore advisers. Gore
has refused to discuss his selection process, but some of those
close to Gore are open admirers of Davis.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic strategist with ties to Gore's campaign noted
that Davis' focus on education dovetails with Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   California's 54 electoral votes make it the biggest prize on
Election Day, but the cost of advertising and traveling here is
immense. A Gore-Davis ticket would boost Gore's chances in the
state and allow Gore to channel some of his resources elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A top-level Gore adviser said he will look for a running mate
who can tip the scales in a state that Republican George W. Bush
must win. Davis could fit the bill, as could Florida Sen. Bob
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has strengths that would aid the ticket outside
California, Gore aides said. He is Roman Catholic, which could help
Gore in certain Midwestern battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   He has proven appeal among Hispanics, the nation's
fastest-growing ethnic group. And he and Gore could take credit for
putting a Hispanic in the governor's office if a Gore-Davis ticket
was elected. Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, a fellow Democrat, would
automatically become governor.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 57, is a Vietnam War veteran, which could lend him
commander-in-chief credentials.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected in a 1998 landslide and retains his sky-high
approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Gore also are strikingly similar in background,
outlook and demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Both are known for dry personalities and plodding styles. Davis
likes to josh that he has recruited Gore as his ''charisma
adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   Both went to law school and to Vietnam. Both marched steadily
through the ranks of government, carving niches as cautious,
moderate ''New Democrats'' who refuse to be outflanked by
Republicans on GOP issues such as crime and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, his first year in office, Davis burnished that
centrist image with an impressive string of achievements.
</P>
<P>
   He gave California the strictest regulations in the nation on
assault weapons and cheap ''Saturday Night Special'' handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Davis took steps to fix the deplorable state of California's
public schools with new plans for high school graduation tests,
special help for poorly performing schools and a new school ranking
system. He gave patients the right to sue their HMOs as part of a
sweeping health care package.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' stock as a prospective running mate could drop if Bush
pairs himself with a woman or minority, Gore aides say. If that
happens, pressure will mount on Gore to pick someone other than a
white male like Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has pledged to turn down the No. 2 slot if it is offered,
but changing his mind could cause political problems. He would be
criticized as fiercely as his Republican predecessor, Pete Wilson,
was for breaking a 1994 promise not to run for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Davis specifically ruled out running for president or vice
president during his gubernatorial campaign, and he has used
uncharacteristically strong language in dampening speculation ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in a December interview in Washington with The Associated
Press whether he was reconsidering, he said, ''No, exclamation
point.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I come back here, I get down on my hands and knees
and thank the voters of California for electing me governor of
California,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the vice presidency, the former lieutenant governor said:
''If someone wanted to ask me to be vice president, they're
essentially asking me to be an adviser. That's what you are. You
have a wonderful title, and a nice house, but you're an adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Torres, chairman of the California Democratic Party, said
Davis may have a tough time declining the vice president's job if
Gore offers it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nobody who places duty and loyalty higher than Gray
Davis, and when a presidential candidate calls and says the country
is calling, when major political leaders call and say it would
provide a winning combination, people need to consider that very
carefully,'' Torres said.

<HEADLINE> Man Testifies in School Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By DEE-ANN DURBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- A man charged with involuntary manslaughter
for a school shooting in which a 6-year-old boy allegedly killed a
first-grade classmate left the weapon in an open shoebox, according
to court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Jamelle James, 19, is accused of leaving the .32-caliber
semiautomatic handgun in a place where the little boy could find
it. Kayla Rolland, also 6, was fatally shot Feb. 29 at Buell
Elementary School in Mount Morris Township.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's 22-year-old uncle, Sir Marcus Winfrey, who lived with
James, testified Thursday that James bought the handgun and a
shotgun from an acquaintance just before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   He said James would sometimes show off the gun around the house
and pretend to shoot people, but he never did that in front of the
6-year-old and his older brother. The boys had been staying at the
home before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would just point it at people to play around,'' said
Winfrey, who was indicted earlier this month on charges of
possessing stolen guns.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was expected to testify today at James' preliminary
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The boy hasn't been charged. His attorney, Douglas Theodoroff,
said Thursday that the boy received an immunity deal for his
testimony even though he is too young to be prosecuted under state
law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just felt it was in my client's best interest to formalize
that before he would testify,'' Theodoroff said. ''He's 6. It's
very distracting. I think it's important that he be able to
concentrate on making these statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Earthly Knight, a family friend of James, said the handgun
didn't belong to James, contradicting earlier statements he made to
police.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lie sometimes. Everybody lies,'' Knight said. ''What they
were trying to do was make me say it was Jamelle's gun.''

<HEADLINE> U.N.: Horn of Africa Faces Drought  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations has warned that up to
16 million people are at risk from a major drought in northeastern
Africa, where a devastating famine 15 years ago left nearly 1
million people dead.
</P>
<P>
   As in the mid-1980s, Ethiopia again is most in danger, facing a
severe food crisis because of poor and infrequent rains and
continued fighting with neighboring Eritrea, said Carolyn McAskie,
deputy U.N. emergency relief coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   But six other Horn of Africa countries have also lost food
stocks to the drought, fighting and continued instability from
refugee flows -- including Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Kenya, Uganda
and Djibouti, she said at a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to draw attention to the crisis and mobilize the
necessary relief operation, Secretary-General Kofi Annan has asked
the head of the World Food Program, Catherine Bertini, to travel to
the region next month as his envoy, McAskie announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are facing the real prospect in two months from now of
another catastrophe which can be averted with the right kind of
donor assistance,'' McAskie said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that it will cost $205 million to
bring the needed 410,000 tons of food and other assistance to the
12.4 million people at risk of famine in the seven most-affected
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But U.N. officials estimate that the crisis may eventually
affect 16 million people, including people in Tanzania, Rwanda and
Burundi, requiring more than a million tons of food aid.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia is by far the worst affected and will account for 80
percent of the aid requirement, McAskie said.
</P>
<P>
   During a drought in 1984-85, nearly 1 million people died of
starvation or related illness in Ethiopia, according to estimates.
The images of emaciated Ethiopians in the West prompted an enormous
relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without increased donor support for immediate food relief
assistance, the international community may be confronted with the
sort of food crisis the region tragically had to deal with 15 years
ago,'' a U.N. statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is urgent that pre-emptive measures are now taken to avert
such a catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has issued an appeal for food aid of $190
million just for Ethiopia, half of which has been met. But there
has been no response to the U.N. appeal for neighboring Eritrea,
McAskie said.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the problem may well increase since prospects
for the rains expected in May and June are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Bertini plans to travel to the region beginning April 11,
visiting Ethiopia, Djibouti, Eritrea and Kenya to try to raise
awareness about the situation and press governments to give aid
workers secure access to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers have often been prevented from reaching at-risk
groups in countries such as Sudan due to fighting. In southern
Somalia on Thursday, the United Nations stopped its air and ground
operations after gunmen shot at one of its aircraft. No one was
injured.

<HEADLINE> Chefs Learn Recipe for TV Success  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL ZOLL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Louis Ekus, smiling and talking, dips a
spoon into an empty bowl and pretends to drop balls of raw dough on
a tray.
</P>
<P>
   The move is routine in any kitchen, except the ones on
television, where filling a cookie sheet incorrectly or using the
wrong pot could cost you ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember, those viewers are lost sheep,'' Ekus tells his
students, an audience of about 40. ''Those lost sheep don't think
for one minute they can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekus, a presenter at this week's meeting of the International
Association of Culinary Professionals, teaches on-air tips to chefs
hoping to become the next Julia Child or Emeril Lagasse.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Cooks) think that their show is about the food in front of
them. They forget they're there to entertain,'' said Ekus, who has
trained cooks for shows on the Food Network, Lifetime and other
channels.
</P>
<P>
   One common blunder: offering to share the ''secret'' to cooking,
which Ekus believes is intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those lost sheep don't think for one minute they can do it.
Let them into the inner sanctum,'' Ekus said, suggesting instead to
say, ''there's no secret'' to cooking a recipe.
</P>
<P>
   The raw dough demonstration teaches the crucial tray-swapping
technique, part of an arsenal of tricks meant to sustain the
illusion that the chef is cooking in front of the TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   The important lessons, according to Ekus, are as much about
rolling with the punches, as rolling out the dough.
</P>
<P>
   He showed a clip of a woman who appeared on a TV show to bake
rhubarb pie only to discover that the host hated rhubarb. He shook
a piece of rhubarb at her while she tried to speak, then, on
camera, held a pie in one hand and chased the producer around the
set.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Ritchie, host of ''Cookin' with Carol'' on cable and local
television in the Dallas area, was doing a segment on cooking with
children, when a boy grabbed an ice cube and started sucking on it,
unaware that a microphone clamped to his shirt was picking up the
sound.
</P>
<P>
   ''It drowned everyone out,'' said Ritchie, who took the class to
learn tips to help her take her show national.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember to keep your poise. It's OK to laugh at what you're
doing.''

<HEADLINE> Republicans Raise $9.5M in March  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican Party raised $9.5 million in
March -- its best fund-raising month this year -- as it continues to
pad its war chest for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Chairman Mel Sembler said donors were focusing on the
November general election now that George W. Bush is the party's
likely presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republicans are energized,'' Sembler said Thursday. ''They're
enthusiastic that the primaries are now behind us and we're all
pulling together.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that enthusiasm will help the party surpass the March
total in a single night in April, when its annual gala will bring
in a record-shattering $15 million. Bush is the headliner for the
April 26 black-tie event. Six-figure donors will be able to attend
a private reception with the Texas governor before the fund-raising
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The March fund-raising will boost the size of the RNC's bank
account, which had at $20 million at the beginning of the month. In
comparison, the Democratic National Committee had less than $6
million on hand when it last disclosed its finances at the end of
December.
</P>
<P>
   Updated fund-raising figures are due at the Federal Election
Commission in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials plan to spend $20 million on issue
advertisements in support of Republican candidates and another
$13.7 million to help elect Bush, Sembler said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Republican National Committee raised $26 million
during the first three months of the year toward a year-end goal of
$177 million.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's effort soon will get a boost when some of Bush's top
fund-raisers join the party apparatus. In addition, the Texas
governor is still raising money for his presidential campaign,
taking in $2.7 million in the last two weeks. Bush has shattered
all fund-raising records by pulling in more than $75 million for
his campaign.

<HEADLINE> Council Mulls Way To Get Iraq Aid  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In an effort to get more food and medicine
to Iraq, the Security Council was considering a U.S. resolution to
double the amount Baghdad can spend on spare parts to repair its
ailing oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Independent experts have said Iraq must rebuild and upgrade its
dilapidated pumping stations to continue exporting crude through
the U.N. oil-for-food program, which lets Baghdad buy humanitarian
goods using proceeds from U.N.-supervised oil sales.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's oil industry -- its main source of revenue -- was targeted
during the Persian Gulf War and has been decimated by nearly a
decade of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. oil-for-food program was started in 1996 to provide for
Iraqis suffering under sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council agreed in June 1998 to allow Iraq to use
$300 million every six months from oil-for-food proceeds to buy
spare parts for its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the independent experts
recommended last year that the amount be doubled so the vital
repairs can be made.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution expected to be considered today would allow Iraq
to spend $600 million every six months.
</P>
<P>
   The United States agreed to the measure and sponsored the
resolution after its tough line on Iraq sanctions came under
increasing fire at home and abroad in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Ambassador James Cunningham introduced the draft a
week ago during an open debate of the council at which most
ambassadors and Annan himself criticized the U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, they complained that the United States was paralyzing
repairs on the oil industry by placing more than $1 billion in
contracts for spare parts and other equipment on hold in the U.N.
sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
   Washington says it has to review the contracts to make sure the
equipment isn't used to help Iraqi President Saddam Hussein rebuild
his weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Bush Rallies Wisconsin Republicans  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Forget waiting until fall -- or the summer
political conventions, even. George W. Bush is already rallying
Republicans in the swing state of Wisconsin to ''man the phones,
distribute the literature, stand up and say, 'Let's go get 'em!'''
</P>
<P>
   Today, with a fund-raising luncheon in Green Bay, the
presumptive GOP presidential nominee adds another $50,000 to the
war chest for his seven-month campaign against Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner Thursday night benefiting the Waukesha County GOP
outside Milwaukee, Bush asked the state's ground troops to
mobilize. He ridiculed his Democratic rival for traveling to
Wisconsin earlier in the week to unveil new campaign finance reform
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The man must think America has amnesia,'' Bush harrumphed to
knowing laughter from the sold-out crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Having staked a claim to two issues Democrats have traditionally
made their own -- Social Security and education -- Bush was
campaigning at a school today for the fourth straight day. And on
Social Security, he said, ''I can't wait for the debate between
somebody who's done nothing for seven years and a campaign who's
willing to lay out a vision that will save and secure Social
Security not only for today but for the years coming down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway countered that Bush's
tax-cut proposals would leave no money to spend on education or
Social Security or any other program.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real centerpiece of his agenda is an enormous tax cut that
may force him to go back on these promises,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, was spending a quiet day off the campaign trail
today, celebrating his 52nd birthday with his family at home in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Bush and his vanquished GOP primary opponent,
John McCain, took an important step toward party reconciliation
when their rival camps struck a deal giving Bush six of the
Michigan delegates that McCain won in the state before suspending
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement allows Michigan Gov. John Engler to attend the
Republican national convention as a delegate for Bush, instead of
for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, Bush campaigned with Gov. Tommy Thompson and
looked ahead to the next momentous decision of the campaign:
Selection of a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter reminded Bush of the open speculation surrounding Bob
Dole's 1996 pick that led Thompson, who was passed over by Dole, to
complain at the time about the indignity of the process.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had not yet put a strategy in place, but promised
''a quiet effort to screen potential candidates'' by a selection
committee of people who can ''keep their counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There does not need to be a lot of needless leaks, rumors and
gossip,'' Bush said.

<HEADLINE> NJ Mayor Indicted in Bribery Case  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- When Milton Milan was elected mayor of New
Jersey's poorest city three years ago, he pledged put more police
officers on the streets and crack down on crime.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities say that once he was in office, he committed
several crimes himself, collecting more than $30,000 in bribes and
gifts from contractors and mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milan put the office of mayor up for sale. Whatever you needed
from him, you could buy from him,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert J.
Cleary.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Milan surrendered to authorities after a 19-count
indictment accused him of accepting cash bribes, vacations,
automobiles and home improvement work from individuals and firms
seeking to do business with the city.
</P>
<P>
   The official charges include mail and wire fraud, extortion and
money laundering, for allegedly handling $65,000 in drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also alleges that former mob boss Ralph Natale
and mob associates ''made direct payments of money and other
benefits'' to Milan. Natale has been cooperating with federal
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, a 37-year-old ex-Marine, called the indictment
politically motivated and vowed to be back at work today.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to stay down. I'm going to get back up and
fight. I'm going to continue to be mayor of this city,'' Milan said
after being freed on $150,000 bail. He said he was going right back
to work because ''I still have time on the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic stopped and spectators gawked at the sight of Milan, the
city's first Hispanic mayor, walking to the courthouse to answer
the charges. He is the third mayor of this desperately poor city of
87,000 near Philadelphia to be indicted in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, a first-term Democrat elected in 1997, had been under
scrutiny by federal authorities in a wide-ranging investigation of
alleged corruption in city government. The indictment charges him
with criminal activity dating to March 1996, three months after he
became a city council member.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney said Milan ''was corrupted from the minute he
set foot in City Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor designed this pay-to-play system for his own selfish
benefit, and the people of this city be damned,'' Cleary said.
</P>
<P>
   Milan's name also was mentioned prominently in the recent
federal trial of two men convicted as leaders of a Camden drug
ring. Several witnesses testified that Milan sold drugs in Camden
in the 1980s and bought several shipments of cocaine before
becoming mayor.
</P>
<P>
   However, Camden County prosecutor's spokesman Greg Reinert said
he knew of no pending drug-related case or investigation involving
Milan.
</P>
<P>
   City Council member Ali Sloan-El, a persistent critic of Milan,
termed the federal indictment ''an embarrassment to this city.''
</P>
<P>
   But Milan said the entire matter was ''a political procedure.
What could not be done politically has been turned into a criminal
procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Milan include mail and wire fraud, extortion
and money laundering. If convicted on all counts, he could be
sentenced to up to more than 100 years in prison and face hundreds
of thousands of dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, however, was concentrating on work. Besides that, he
said: ''I'm scheduled to play a little golf.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sending More Troops to Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An extra contingent of 125 U.S. Army soldiers
is being dispatched to Kosovo to help monitor a border area with
southern Serbia where ethnic Albanian militias have been stirring
up trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate but related move, Defense Secretary William Cohen
ordered the Army to send 14 tanks and six 155mm artillery guns to a
1st Armored Division company in Skopje, Macedonia -- just across the
border from Kosovo -- as a deterrent to ''mischief'' in southern
Serbia, spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1st Armored Division unit has been in Skopje since January
without its normal set of tanks and artillery. Bacon said he could
not immediately explain why they had been sent there without the
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The moves reflect a growing American and NATO concern about the
potential for a flare-up of ethnic violence in the Presevo Valley,
a predominantly ethnic Albanian area adjacent to Kosovo. Just two
days ago the State Department expressed disappointment that ethnic
Albanian militia groups have failed to live up to a commitment made
earlier this month to end an insurgency in that section of southern
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the State Department warned the Albanians in Kosovo
to avoid provocative acts in that area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rest assured that our antenna are up,'' spokesman James B.
Foley said. ''We are going to be very vigilant. And we are prepared
to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Extremist Albanians are accused of storing weapons and provoking
the Serbs. Earlier this month U.S. peacekeepers, who are
responsible for southeastern Kosovo, launched raids to seize
Albanian arms.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the tanks and artillery headed for Macedonia would
provide U.S. troops there with an extra measure of self-protection,
and enable the troops to conduct their normal training with a full
set of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''It (also) will serve as a deterrent to any mischief that might
take place along the borders of Macedonia,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Both new deployments -- the tanks and artillery as well as the
soldiers -- were requested by Brig. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, commander
of U.S. peacekeeping forces in Kosovo, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of 125 extra Army soldiers is designed to provide
more ''eyes and ears'' in the Presevo Valley area, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they see things along the border that require investigation
by people on foot, it's these men and women who will provide the
duty investigating,'' he said. ''They're basically foot soldiers.
And as I say, they operate as eyes and ears for Brigadier General
Sanchez and his troops, and they'll be patrolling in the border
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the 125 soldiers are to remain in Kosovo for about
six months. They will work in conjunction with pilotless
reconnaissance aircraft that are being dispatched to improve
surveillance along border areas.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its NATO allies bombed Serbia last year to
force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw troops and
special police from Kosovo where they were accused of brutalizing
secession-minded ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   There are 37,000 NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo, including
5,900 Americans.

<HEADLINE> House Approves $13 Billion Measure  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of legislation providing $13
billion for drug-fighting efforts in Colombia, peacekeeping in
Kosovo and for disasters at home are hoping that its House approval
will intensify pressure on Trent Lott to bring the bill to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, R-Miss., says the measure is too expensive and would slow
his chamber's work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not if I can help it, not in that form,'' the Senate majority
leader said Thursday when asked if he would allow the bill to be
debated.
</P>
<P>
   The House easily adopted the measure Thursday by a 263-146 vote,
with majorities of both parties supporting it. President Clinton
and many senators also favor the measure, which is loaded with
money for popular causes like battling drugs abroad, financing the
military and helping victims of last fall's Hurricane Floyd
recover.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
plans to push a roughly $6 billion version of the measure through
his panel next Tuesday in hopes that it will eventually reach the
full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the House bill and urged swift Senate action.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is vital that Congress avoids delay,'' he said in a
statement issued in New York Thursday. ''The costs of delay are
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton complained that the bill did not provide funding for
areas of ''the highest importance,'' including embassy security in
Kosovo and other money for the Kosovo peace effort. At the same
time, it did providing ''unnecessary funding'' for other projects.
He said he hoped the Senate would produce a better version.
</P>
<P>
   Underlining the effort to spark Senate action, Barry McCaffrey,
director of the White House drug policy office, called a reporter
to say money in the bill for combating Colombian coca production
would help ''protect our country from what are essentially 52,000
dead a year.'' That is the number of Americans believed to die
annually from illegal drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Before the House approved the bill, lawmakers voted 219-200 to
kill a bipartisan amendment aimed at pressuring European allies to
contribute hundreds of millions of dollars they have promised to
help rebuild Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provision, if Clinton had not certified by June 1 that
the Europeans were cooperating, he would have been required to
begin a ''safe, orderly and phased withdrawal'' of U.S.
peacekeepers the next day from the war-shattered Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   The language reflected frustration among many lawmakers that
though the United States flew 70 percent of the bombing missions in
last year's war against Yugoslavia, European contributions for
economic, humanitarian and policing aid have lagged behind their
promises.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting the proposal would ''continue your role as the
enablers of European dependence'' on U.S. defense dollars, said
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., one of the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials lobbied hard against the provision.
Defense Secretary William Cohen wrote lawmakers that it was ''in
reality a vehicle to bring about a U.S. withdrawal from Kosovo''
that would ''encourage extremists elements in Kosovo and Belgrade,
who are determined to see NATO's mission in the Balkans fail.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue, however, may not be dead.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., is
ready to push it in the Senate. And one of its House sponsors, Rep.
John Kasich, R-Ohio, said he might try again, perhaps adding
language letting the president waive its enforcement under some
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The House also voted 386-28 to add $100 million for local
firefighting agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The bill -- more than twice the $5.5 billion Clinton wanted --
contains $1.7 billion for military equipment and training and other
aid for the Colombian government's battle against drug producers
and their leftist rebel allies, who control the southern part of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Amid worries that the United States could be ensnared in a civil
war that has already lasted decades, the House voted by voice to
limit the number of American military personnel there to 300.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said privately that the measure, sponsored by Rep. Gene
Taylor, D-Miss., had loopholes and that the Pentagon has no plans
to exceed that figure anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Also included is $9 billion for the Pentagon, including $2
billion for U.S. forces in Kosovo and money for upgrading weapons,
buying fuel and buttressing the military's health-insurance
program.
</P>
<P>
   There is also about $2.2 billion for natural disasters at home,
including more than $300 million that North Carolina lawmakers say
are for that state's costs of rebuilding from last fall's Hurricane
Floyd.

<HEADLINE> Notorious Mexico Kidnapper Captured  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Marcos Tinoco seemed a dapper and educated
man -- charming widows and secretaries in the richer neighborhoods
of Mexico's capital.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors said Thursday he used that charm to gather
information on wealthy victims -- most of them Jews -- who were
kidnapped and sometimes had fingers sliced off to force ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Tinoco, 41, was arrested this week while driving in the Polanco
neighborhood of Mexico City. On Thursday the federal attorney
general's office presented him to the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing relatively calm before the flashing lights, Tinoco
asked for silence and then shouted, ''Innocent!''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the attorney general's organized crime unit, Jose
Trinidad Larrieta, said Tinoco was ''one of the most-sought
kidnappers'' and he led ''the most active and dangerous criminal
organization'' of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Tinoco is suspected of at least 11 kidnappings over
the past 15 months, 10 of them aimed at Jews whose relatives,
employees and acquaintances he would befriend to gather
information.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of his kidnappings last only a few hours,''
Larrieta said, calling Tinoco ''the king of the express kidnap.''
</P>
<P>
   But on one occasion, he said, a victim was held for 18 days. A
finger was sliced off and sent to the victim's family to force a
ransom payment.
</P>
<P>
   Ransoms ranged from $38,000 to $650,000, Larrieta said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Reforma reported that Tinoco was a fourth-year law
student when he dropped out of school. It said he tried his hand
running jewelry shops in Mexico City and Cancun, but failed.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting from a videotaped interview it said was conducted by
federal police, Reforma said Tinoco described himself as a
teetotaling sportsman who practiced skydiving and karate.
</P>
<P>
   Larrieta said Tinoco used his legal training to intimidate
victims. Kidnappers impersonating federal police would threaten to
frame them on drug charges if they did not offer a payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Tinoco ''created false arrest orders which he showed to his
victims to make them believe there really was a judicial order
against them,'' Larrieta said.
</P>
<P>
   The capture of Tinoco is one in a series of triumphs over famed
kidnapping gangs by federal officials -- though daily newspapers
from around Mexico still often carry reports of new abductions.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic arrest was the August 1998 capture of Daniel
Arizmendi, who was notorious for sending victims' ears to their
families. He is now serving a 50-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Larrieta said police were investigating a possible link between
Tinoco and one of Mexico's most famous drug smugglers, the
now-imprisoned and convicted Hector Palma. He said one of the
victims was held at a house owned by a brother of Palma.

<HEADLINE> Economy Extends Retirement Programs  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Armed with news that the strong economy has
improved the financial outlook for Social Security and Medicare,
the Clinton administration is renewing pressure on Congress to
create a new prescription drug benefit for the elderly this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an issue of a political will, not an issue of
resources,'' said Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans are including $40 billion for drug
assistance for the elderly in their budget blueprint, but they and
the administration are far from agreement on exactly how benefits
should be designed and who should be eligible. And election-year
grandstanding will make compromise difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the strong economy, Medicare will have an additional
eight years, until 2023, before cash runs short to pay benefits to
aging baby boomers. And Social Security will remain financially
healthy an extra three years, until 2037, trustees of the programs
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, the good news prompted Republicans to renew
attacks on Clinton's proposals to commit future income tax
surpluses to bolster the nation's retirement programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of that failed approach, we should work on a real plan
that saves Social Security and creates personal savings accounts
for all Americans,'' said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Bill Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third consecutive year that both Social Security and
Medicare have shown improvement in their long-range financial
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   For Medicare, it was the best report card in 25 years. The
health insurance program for the elderly and disabled had been
projected to run short of cash in 2001, lending urgency to
lawmakers' struggle over historic legislation to balance the
federal budget back in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, trustees reported that date had improved to 2015. It
was moved to 2023 in their newest estimate on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the date when Social Security will exhaust its trust
fund was moved back to 2037, compared with an estimate of 2034 last
year. The trustees had pushed it off by two years in 1999 and three
in 1998, from 2029.
</P>
<P>
   Also significant this year, the trustees estimated that Medicare
will take in more money from workers' payroll taxes than it has to
pay out in benefits until 2010, when it will have to start dipping
into its trust fund to pay bills.
</P>
<P>
   Before the boost from the strong economy, Medicare had already
started to dip into the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security will have to start tapping its trust fund in
2015, the trustees said this year, compared with last year's
estimate of 2014.
</P>
<P>
   Economic factors contributing to the brighter prospects for
Social Security and Medicare included the lowest unemployment rate
in 30 years. With more Americans working, more are also paying the
payroll taxes that support the two programs, padding their balance
sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Low inflation also has saved Social Security money because
yearly cost-of-living raises to retirees are smaller.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Medicare spending decreased slightly in 1999, by
about 1 percent -- the first decline in the program's history. The
trustees attributed that to restrained inflation, budget cuts
ordered by Congress in 1997, and a crackdown on fraud and billing
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare spending is not expected to continue to fall, however,
mainly because the nation's elderly population is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Medicare's trust fund only backs up part of the program:
the core hospital benefits. Other coverage, known as Part B,
including doctor's office visits and other outpatient care, is paid
for with income taxes and participants' premiums. Part B costs
continued to climb last year, the trustees said, although at a
slower rate than expected.

Senate Looking At Gas Tax Rollback

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first hurdle is out of the way, but supporters of
legislation that would temporarily roll back 4.3 cents of the federal gas tax
still face strong opposition from most Democrats and some Republicans. Even if

<HEADLINE> Train's Collision With Bus Probed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TENNGA, Ga. (AP) -- The school bus struck by a freight train here
this week did not stop at the rail crossing, according to
investigators who also said drivers cannot adequately see an
approaching train.
</P>
<P>
   Three children died as the result of Tuesday's collision. Four
other children and the driver were seriously injured as the train
ripped the bus from its chassis and dragged it for 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've come to the preliminary conclusion that the bus did not
stop at the crossing prior to entering it,'' said Ken Suydam, the
National Transportation Safety Board's investigator in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said Thursday that the horn on CSX train
sounded for at least eight continuous seconds before the collision.
They said a radio was on inside the bus and there were several
conversations taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Suydam said he could not say whether bus driver Rhonda Cloer
tried to stop the bus. The vehicle's brakes were being examined and
Suydam said the bus's speed had not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Cloer has refused to be interviewed by investigators, referring
questions to her lawyer, Suydam said.
</P>
<P>
   Using a locomotive still streaked with yellow paint from the
crash, the investigators re-enacted the moments before the crash,
steering the freight train through the crossing, checking its
braking distance and the volume of its whistle.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB Chairman Jim Hall boarded a duplicate of the school bus
destroyed in the crash to observe the driver's visibility at the
crossing and to study its seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   He also interviewed local residents, many of whom told him the
crossing's marking -- signs, but no crossbars or warning lights --
was inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is school buses should not go over railroad
crossings of this type,'' Hall said. ''This is not a safe situation
for children.''
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB said its final report will not be released for months.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said states should have taken more seriously an NTSB report
last year calling for more warning devices at railroad crossings.
He promised to look into ways more crossings could be equipped with
crossbars and signals.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral service were scheduled today for Kayla Silvers, 6, and
Daniel Pack, 9. Both died instantly in the crash. Weekend services
are scheduled for 9-year-old Amber Pritchett, who died Wednesday
night at T.C. Thompson Children's Hospital in Chattanooga, Tenn.

<HEADLINE> Study: Contaminated Chickens Missed  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A study found that one in every 100 chicken
carcasses gets past a federal inspector with fecal contamination or
signs of disease on it, and federal officials say a new inspection
program could reduce that rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''While our system is good, it's not perfect,'' said Thomas
Billy, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken carcasses are subject to additional cleansing after they
pass the inspectors, so all fecal material should be eliminated
before the meat reaches consumers, industry officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released Thursday, was conducted over the past year
at 16 poultry plants that have agreed to take part in the new
inspection program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the existing system, federal inspectors sit at fixed
points along production lines and have about 2 seconds to check
each carcass for defects and contamination as it passes by. Under
the new system, that job is being left to company employees.
Federal inspectors are being pulled off the production lines to do
testing and oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Billy said that will allow inspectors to focus on catching
food-safety problems, such as fecal contamination, rather than
looking for defects or stray feathers that should be the packing
plant's responsibility to find. Inspectors will be doing four times
as much sampling for fecal contamination as they do now, as well as
testing for dangerous microbes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 306 of the 32,075 carcasses sampled in the study had fecal
contamination. Another 43, or 0.1 percent, had lesions and other
signs of poultry diseases that are dangerous to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates generally support the experimental system.
But the contamination rate is already low enough that it will be
difficult to reduce it, said Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center
for Science in the Public Interest. ''The data is going to be tough
for the industry to beat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The plants also were tested for the presence of harmful
microbes, including salmonella. About 6 percent of the chickens
sampled were contaminated with salmonella. The federal limit is 20
percent and the national average is about 10 percent, DeWaal said.
</P>
<P>
   Additional testing will be done at the plants to see how they
performing under the new system. The first such data is expected to
be available in June or July.
</P>
<P>
   The American Federation of Government Employees, which
represents 7,000 inspectors, unsuccessfully sued USDA to stop the
new inspection program, claiming that a 1907 law requires that the
agency physically examine every meat and poultry carcass.
</P>
<P>
   The union says the department essentially is allowing companies
to police themselves. The program started last fall at a plant in
Alabama and other facilities are being phased in over time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 16 chicken plants, the program is being
started at five plants that slaughter hogs and three that process
turkeys.

<HEADLINE> New London expansion won't harm giant sequoia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- As the city branches out along its
waterfront, it's taking care not to harm a very special tree.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-foot giant sequoia has been growing at the site of the
former Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory since 1966. The center's
staff planted it then when it was about a foot tall.
</P>
<P>
   The sequoia, a relative of the California redwood, rode east on
an airplane with the lab's former technical director, Harold E.
Nash, and his wife. Their donation was the first ornament planted
next to a memorial to World War II merchant mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The sound lab closed in the 1990s and moved to Newport, Rhode
Island, clearing the way for the city to plan a major development
for the waterfront. The tree will figure heavily in the project,
said Damon Hemmerdinger, the city's director of real estate
development.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a hotel to the waterward side of this tree, and a
condominium complex to its west, said Hemmerdinger.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been working on how to be sure that both the memorial
and the tree are treated appropriately over time,'' Hemmerdinger
said. ''Rest assured that for the last nine months, or longer,
we've been very aware that there's a tree there that deserves
special attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The sequoia is a cypress tree with reddish bark that, in the
West, grows to great heights with gigantic trunks.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Dreyer, director of the Connecticut College Arboretum,
said he knows of four other giant sequoias in Connecticut and a few
more around New England. New England's largest sequoia, an
82-footer, is in Bristol, R.I. A 65-foot sequoia grows in New
Haven, said Dreyer.
</P>
<P>
   Members of New London Landmarks, a preservation organization,
recently learned of the New London tree and want it and the
merchant marine monument to remain a centerpiece of the expansion,
said member Stephen Hallquist.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is definitely unique,'' Hallquist said. ''It's not
something you find in everybody's neighborhood.''

<HEADLINE> Organic Cropland Doubled in 1990s  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers doubled the nation's organic crop
acreage in the 1990s, and production of organic eggs and milk
increased even more to meet rising consumer demand, the government
says.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of certified organic cropland grew from 403,000 acres
in 1992 to 850,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The number of organic laying hens jumped from 43,981 to 537,826
during the same period, a time when public concern about bacterial
contamination of eggs was on the rise. The number of organic milk
cows grew from 2,265 to 12,897.
</P>
<P>
   ''Organic farming became one of the fastest growing segments of
U.S. agriculture during the 1990s and producers, exporters and
retailers are still struggling to meet consumer demand,'' according
to a study by the Agriculture Department's Economic Research
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Organic farming is still a very small part of U.S. agriculture,
however. About 0.2 percent of U.S. cropland was certified organic
in 1997, compared with 1.5 percent in Europe, where farmers are
offered government aid to convert to organic agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of organic pasture and rangeland actually declined
from 1992 to 1997, from 532,000 acres to 496,000 acres. Economists
say organic production of meat and poultry lagged during the decade
because they could not be labeled as organic until February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of the USDA study was released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Organic farming practices prohibit the use of synthetic
fertilizers and pesticides for crops or antibiotics or hormones in
livestock. New national standards for organic food that the
department announced earlier this month are expected to stimulate
growth in the industry by bolstering consumer confidence and making
it easier to export the products.
</P>
<P>
   But the study said it remains difficult for farmers to switch to
organic practices for a number of reasons: the cost and risk
involved in shifting to the new methods, insufficient numbers of
processors and distributors, and limited access to capital.
</P>
<P>
   While organic products can fetch significantly higher prices
than conventional ones, farmers cannot sell their crops as organic
during the three-year conversion period required to be certified.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 2 percent of apple, grape, lettuce and carrot
acreage was organic in 1997, along with 1 percent of oats, dry peas
and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that organic agriculture has continued to
expand since 1997. California Certified Organic Farmers, one of the
top certifying agencies in the state, estimated its 1999 acreage at
96,878, up 38 percent from 1997. Idaho estimated its 1999 organic
cropland at 85,061 acres, up 55 percent from 1997.

<HEADLINE> Waterbury Mayor defaulted on student loan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Mayor Philip Giordano defaulted on a
student loan, but agreed to pay back the $6,500 he owed after being
sued by the lender, the Waterbury Republican-American reported
today.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement came one month after Giordano filed a motion in
the case asking Hemar Insurance Co., to specify when he stopped
paying the debt, so he could determine whether the claim ''is
barred by the statute of limitations,'' the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Republican-American the mayor at first denied
knowledge of the loan Thursday, but eventually told a reporter that
he ''missed a couple of payments.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the bills are sent to his law office, and that
since he had not stopped by there to pick up his mail in five or
six months, it had slipped his mind. He added that any delinquent
notices or phone messages from the bank regarding the debt would
also be waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an oversight,'' Giordano said. ''I've been paying it
off for years. I am very diligent about paying my bills.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to the lawsuit, the mayor has not made a payment
on the loan since at least July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   David Pite, a New Haven lawyer hired by Hemar to collect the
loan, said he will withdraw the lawsuit in the coming days since
Giordano has agreed to pay the debt's full amount.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year loan, available to newly graduated law school
students studying to take the bar, was taken out by the mayor in
August 1990, after Giordano completed study at the Thomas M. Cooley
law school in Lansing, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   It carries a variable interest rate, now set at about 8.3
percent. Giordano, who earns roughly $85,000 a year, said his
monthly bill was $48 a month. The company said the mayor defaulted
on $6,521.36 in payments.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano, a Republican, is considering a run for the U.S. Senate
seat held by Democrat Joseph Lieberman.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Among Tax Laggards  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Internal Revenue Service employees can be
summarily fired for nonpayment of taxes, but not the members of
Congress and their staffs who helped write that law and owe about
$10.5 million in unpaid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   IRS data released Thursday shows that the nonpayment rate as of
October 1999 for the House was 8.4 percent, while that in the
Senate was 7.5 percent. The 1998 Internal Revenue Service reform
law passed by Congress made nonpayment grounds for immediate
dismissal of the agency's workers.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the National Treasury Employees Union, Colleen
Kelley, said in a letter to congressional leaders Thursday that the
immediate firing provisions for IRS employees are ''especially
harsh when compared to the fact that no similar penalty of any kind
applies to members of Congress or congressional staff.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems patently unfair to hold those who write the tax laws
to a lesser standard than those who must enforce them,'' Kelley
added.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Members of Congress and their staffs have an obligation, like
all taxpayers, to pay their taxes in full and on time,'' said the
Delaware Republican, who frequently gets extensions to pay taxes
but is not running behind, a spokeswoman added.
</P>
<P>
   The agency did not release the names of those who owe.
</P>
<P>
   The total for most civilian agencies of the executive branch was
6.2 percent, but some Cabinet agencies were much higher. The
Education Department, for example, had a 9.2 percent nonpayment
rate; Housing and Urban Development's was 8.5 percent and the Labor
Department was 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other high nonpayment rates: 8.2 percent for the FBI and 7.9
percent for the Coast Guard. The CIA's nonpayment rate was nearly 4
percent, while the Federal Reserve System rate was 8.2 percent. The
Defense Department's nonpayment rate came to 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department, which includes the IRS, had a tax
nonpayment rate of 3.8 percent, the lowest of the Cabinet agencies.
The White House nonpayment rate was 6.5 percent, an improvement
over the 13 percent recorded last year.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has compiled data on federal employee nonpayment of
taxes through its document matching systems since 1993 as a way of
spurring greater compliance throughout the government. The numbers
include people who are gradually paying off their tax bills through
installment agreements with the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the nonpayment rate for the federal government is
about 5.2 percent, compared with 8.1 percent for the U.S.
population. The balance owed by these federal employees is
estimated at $2.4 billion.

<HEADLINE> NASA Workers Satisfied With Jobs  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal workers who help explore space or
protect the environment are among the most satisfied with their
jobs, while those who enforce immigration and food safety rules are
the least happy.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 60 percent of federal employees say they are very or
somewhat satisfied with their jobs, according to a government
survey released today. That compares with about 62 percent in
similar private sector surveys, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Just 35 percent said their organization has made a priority of
Vice President Al Gore's seven-year effort to ''reinvent
government'' by encouraging employee innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Only 29 percent said creativity and innovation are rewarded; 49
percent said their opinions count at work.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three-fourths said their agency has goals aimed at
meeting customer expectations, another focus of the reinvention
effort. But less than half -- 43 percent -- said there are
well-defined systems for getting customer feedback and complaints
to the right employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government is a large organization and moving this kind of
fundamental change to the level where front-line workers see it in
their daily life is a long-term proposition,'' said Morley
Winograd, director of the National Partnership for Reinventing
Government, which co-sponsored the survey.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that job satisfaction jumped to 84 percent among
workers who said their agency stresses reinvention.
</P>
<P>
   The highest satisfaction scores went to the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, which has suffered numerous setbacks to
its Mars program, at 78 percent; Environmental Protection Agency,
77; General Services Administration, 75; National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, 75; the Census Bureau, 72; and Office
of Personnel Management, 72.
</P>
<P>
   In the lowest group were the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, 45 percent; Food Safety and Inspection Service, 49; U.S.
Customs Service, 50; and Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, 52.
</P>
<P>
   Error margins within agencies ranged as high as 9 percentage
points, so scores cannot be ranked accurately.
</P>
<P>
   OPM surveyed 32,265 randomly selected employees, out of 1.4
million federal workers, in September 1999. The overall margin of
error is plus or minus 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   Responses didn't change significantly from the first survey in
1998. Winograd said he was ''disappointed at the pace of
improvement'' but managers were making changes.

<HEADLINE> Chen Forms New Taiwanese Party  </HEADLINE>
By ANNIE HUANG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Riding the momentum from his strong
showing, the second-place finisher in Taiwan's presidential
election announced the formation of a new political party today
that could siphon support away from the once-powerful Nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   James Soong, a former top Nationalist official, finished close
behind the winner of last month's vote. His candidacy split the
vote for the Nationalists, ending the party's 51-year rule of
Taiwan and sweeping opposition candidate Chen Shui-bian to power.
</P>
<P>
   Soong said the ''People First Party'' was being formed to keep
''the new social force'' that had emerged in the election campaign
as a voice for reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''We forged a huge social force that demanded peace, democracy,
social stability and ethnic unity, an immense force that will push
Taiwan to march forward,'' Soong said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing political analysts, Soong said his campaign had forced
the Nationalists to promise reforms and pressured president-elect
Chen to moderate his stance on China.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was a vocal supporter of Taiwanese independence, but
softened his position in the tight campaign. Chen now says he would
only call for a vote on independence if China attacked the island.
</P>
<P>
   Chen won 39 percent of the vote, while Soong received 37
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of the new political party crushed hopes that
Soong might return to the Nationalist Party after President Lee
Teng-hui stepped down as party leader to take responsibility for
the upset.
</P>
<P>
   After Lee's resignation, the Nationalists began restructuring
their hierarchy in an attempt to attract new blood.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the United Daily News, a former Nationalist
Party elder, Hau Pei-tsun, said if Soong and the Nationalist
leaders fail to reconcile, Chen would have a ''100 percent'' chance
of winning the next presidential vote in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Hau, a former premier, was expelled by the Nationalists in 1996
for running against Lee.

<HEADLINE> Greek Parties in Dead Heat  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK QUINN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Banners are banned. Rallies are less than
raucous. The mudslingers are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Greece's new brand of politicking: more polite, less
bombastic and to many, it seems, easy to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of fever-pitch campaigns, Greeks this time are
quietly closing in on April 9 parliamentary elections. The stakes
are high in the close race that could further cement the dominance
of the governing Socialists or topple them for only the second time
in 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the drama is low.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the closest to indifference that I have ever seen,''
said Thanos Veremis, president of the Hellenic Foundation for
Defense and Foreign Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Greek politics have undergone a fundamental change in the past
decade. The two main parties, the Socialists and the conservative
New Democracy opposition, have drifted toward the center to court
Greece's burgeoning -- and often politically apathetic -- middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an overlapping of agendas and attitudes between
the two groups, which once sniped at each other from distinct
vantage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialists rose to power with a leftist ideology of generous
patronage and social spending. The United States and its
free-market style of capitalism were demonized.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives rallied around a pro-Western platform and
believed tiny Greece could not afford to antagonize its big
partners in NATO and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's hard to tell the parties apart. Both endorse the drive
to join the EU's single currency. There are no major foreign policy
differences on issues such as improving ties with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether one party wins or the other doesn't make that
tremendous difference to the voters and they know it,'' Veremis
said. ''Many are going to flip a coin just before the elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The new political realities have led to some curious role
reversals.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialists now boast of their fiscal controls, which have
been warmly received by EU partners that once mocked Greece's
double-digit inflation and runaway spending. Inflation is now below
3 percent and Greece is expected to get formal approval to enter
the euro group in June.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have been forced to take up the populist mantle.
They seek support from labor groups -- including farmers -- that once
made up the Socialist power base.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the parties in a dead heat, each supported by roughly
38 percent of Greece's 9.1 million registered voters. Communists
and leftist coalitions account for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the most uncertain outcome of the past 25 years,'' said
Thomas Gerakis, general manager of the Kappa Research polling
company.
</P>
<P>
   New campaign rules have limited or outlawed election trappings
of the past: posters and banners. The ritual of holding mass
rallies survives, but with smaller crowds and more stage managing
for television.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialists, led by Premier Costas Simitis, came to power in
1981 and have lost their hold on the 300-member parliament only
once, from 1990-93. They currently hold 161 seats. New Democracy
has 103.
</P>
<P>
   The New Democracy leader, Costas Caramanlis, badly needs an
election win to remain a credible force in Greek politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The Socialists) want to stay in government because they have
a good premier and now know the job. New Democracy wants to be the
government because it has not governed for a long time, and those
in power for some time have tired,'' said columnist Yiannis
Pretenderis. ''I don't find anything exiting or convincing in
either argument.''

<HEADLINE> GOP's Plan Shows Mixed Results  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans, said Rep. Greg Ganske, a
conservative from Iowa, are supposed to be the champions of state
power and local control. ''Yet here we are today debating a bill
that would take crucial power away from state and local
governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganske, in a recent speech on the House floor, was opposing a
GOP-backed bill that would make it easier to take property rights
cases against local governments to federal courts. He was also
pointing out how difficult it has been for his party to live up to
its promise to take power away from Washington and restore it to
the local level.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich's Republicans came to power in 1995 dedicated to a
''devolution revolution,'' and they can point to some real
successes. Welfare programs have effectively been turned over to
the states and an unfunded mandates act is keeping Congress from
imposing new regulations on the states unless the federal
government pays for them.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have abandoned earlier attempts to abolish the
Education Department, but they have been steadfast in pushing for
school vouchers, block grants and other means of giving state and
local authorities control over education dollars.
</P>
<P>
   However, in other areas, particularly those dealing with crime
and the courts, Republicans often have been as aggressive as their
Democratic counterparts in seeking federal action.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the GOP ambiguity, said Roger Pilon, vice president for
legal affairs at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, is
that ''they want to devolve power, but on the other hand they want
to be active in solving problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy that Congress can address all problems, Pilon
said, is anathema to the constitutional doctrine of reserving to
the states those powers not specifically delegated to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, said Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, one of Congress'
staunchest defenders of states' rights, ''like Democrats, are
serving a constituency. When it pleases their particular
constituency, they nationalize.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives who backed the property rights bill passed by the
House insisted they were defending a constitutional right against
the public taking of private property without just compensation.
Property rights take precedence, said Paul Weyrich, president of
the Free Congress Foundation. ''Those who now claim to be concerned
about local government rights are crying crocodile tears.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Melvin Watt, D-N.C., chided Republicans for ignoring
their states' rights principles. ''They start to backtrack,'' he
said, when ''their moneyed constituents, their corporate
constituents have a different interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have also backed House-passed bills this session to
expand federal judiciary controls over class-action suits and
product liability claims against small businesses. They argued that
the unpredictable patchwork of state laws has enriched lawyers,
produced excessive jury awards to plaintiffs and discouraged
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, in promising a veto, said the
class-action bill was a ''dramatic break from our federal system's
traditional deference to state choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul, who voted against both bills, said that as a physician,
''I can't stand trial lawyers, but I don't want to nationalize tort
law. ... I still think that's the responsibility of the states.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist in 1998 criticized Congress for
federalizing crimes already covered by state law in order to
''appear responsive to every highly publicized societal ill or
sensational crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal crimes have grown from about a dozen in the 18th century
to more than 3,000 today. Lawmakers from both parties in the past
decade have enthusiastically backed bills on carjacking, deadbeat
parents, violence against women and child abuse, often by
stretching the definition of the Constitution's ''commerce clause''
that gives Washington controls over interstate trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress is falling over itself every year to federalize
crime,'' said Cato's Pilon. ''It undermines our system of
federalism and it clutters our federal courts with cases that
belong in state courts.''

<HEADLINE> Antiques Show: We Were Deceived  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Each week, the ''Antiques Roadshow'' features a
story that seems too good to be true, as someone finds out that
their piece of ''junk'' is actually a valuable treasure.
</P>
<P>
   The rags-to-riches stories are part of the charm of the public
television show in which regular people have their wares appraised
by antiques experts.
</P>
<P>
   But producers said that in one instance, what seemed too good to
be true just that. On Thursday, the show cut ties to two experts
who staged ''an extravagant deception'' that violated the show's
premise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they thought they were helping the show, but they were
wrong,'' said Peter McGhee, vice president of national programs at
WGBH-TV in Boston, which produces ''Antiques Roadshow.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred during the show's debut season in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A man showed an appraiser a Civil War sword found in his attic
that he used to cut watermelon. Appraisers were delighted when
presented with the weapon and told the man it was worth $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the two appraisers -- George Juno and Russ Pritchard --
actually knew the man who brought in the sword, and they knew the
sword's history, show officials said.
</P>
<P>
   McGhee said the station was cutting ties with Juno and
Pritchard, and removing them from segments in future shows and
shows that might be rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our objective at this point is to deny them any further
benefit from association with the 'Roadshow,''' McGhee said.
</P>
<P>
   Juno, contacted at his business in Allentown, Pa., denied any
wrongdoing and said the station had been pressured by rival experts
in the antiques business.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were no fake interviews. ... There was never proof,'' he
said. ''It was pressure put on the station by our competitors in an
attempt to get us off the show.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''We still think very highly of WGBH and think the
'Roadshow' is a great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard, who has a business near Philadelphia, did not return
telephone or pager messages Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Antiques Roadshow'' is watched by about 14 million people each
week and has gained such popularity that it was used as a premise
for an episode of the sitcom ''Frasier,'' McGhee said.
</P>
<P>
   The show travels around the country, allowing thousands of
people to show up at tapings to have items examined by dozens of
appraisers. Appraisers who think they have a good story and a good
item approach the show's producers. About 15 to 20 segments are
included in each show.
</P>
<P>
   The appraisers aren't paid, but gain national publicity if they
appear on the program.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Public Clinics Need Funds  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public hospitals and clinics serving the poor
are cutting back services and struggling to survive as they lose
patients to HMOs and take on more uninsured, said a panel of health
experts that recommended spending $2.5 billion over five years to
keep them afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Without the federal funds, many providers of last resort for
people who can't afford to see a doctor will be forced to close,
predicted an Institute of Medicine report on the nation's health
''safety net.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't just assume that these providers will always be
there,'' said Raymond Baxter, IOM panel member and executive vice
president at The Lewin Group, a private health policy research
group. ''People who have come to rely on these clinics will have
their care delayed at best, or won't be able to get care at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Many local public health services are losing patients subsidized
by federal and state programs such as Medicaid -- an important
source of revenue -- to managed care organizations, leaving fewer
dollars to offset the free care they provide to people who can't
pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Contra Costa County health department in northern California
is facing an $8.2 million budget shortfall next year because
revenues are exceeding costs, 31 percent of which goes to providing
care for people with no insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll have to start looking at cutbacks in programs,'' said
Sara Hoffman, assistant county administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Most safety net providers have been able to survive by cobbling
together grants, the report said. Federal officials said more needs
to be done to stabilize the safety net.
</P>
<P>
   ''This report has confirmed our worst fears,'' said Dr. Claude
Earle Fox, head of the Health Resources and Services Administration
at the Department of Health and Human Services. ''We need to get
all of the potential sources of funding working closely together to
ensure that we strengthen the safety net and don't weaken it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, whose department commissioned the IOM study, said a $25
million pilot program for consortiums of safety net providers aims
to improve coordination of care for the uninsured. The Clinton
administration has asked Congress for $1 billion to expand the
program over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine is part of the National Academy of
Sciences, a private organization chartered by Congress to advise
the government of scientific matters.
</P>
<P>
   The term ''safety net'' refers to organizations that are legally
obligated to provide care to people who cannot afford it. They
include some 700 community health centers and 1,300 public
hospitals. Though estimates vary, more than 8 million Americans get
basic health care from these providers.
</P>
<P>
   Many safety net patients are covered by Medicaid, a
federal-state health program for the poor that reimburses safety
net providers and is the single biggest source of revenue for them.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last decade, many states have converted Medicaid to
managed care to cut costs, inviting health maintenance
organizations and other private providers to compete for Medicaid
patients.
</P>
<P>
   While paying patients benefited from having more choices in
medical care, public hospitals and other safety net providers lost
6 percent of their Medicaid patients, the IOM report said.
</P>
<P>
   Some hospitals and clinics have joined managed care groups to
compete, but reimbursement rates for Medicaid patients under those
plans are sometimes less than what it costs to provide care, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Congress in 1997 reduced federal subsidies for public
health centers.
</P>
<P>
   With this backdrop of financial pressures, the number of
uninsured who rely on safety net providers grew by 20 percent
between 1988 and 1998 and now numbers an estimated 44 million, or
nearly one in five Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The report said it also cited a study of 400 local health
departments that showed 23 percent of urban centers and 17 percent
of nonurban centers had stopped providing basic health care
services.

<HEADLINE> Senate Gives Rural TV Providers Aid  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans in rural markets may soon be able to
watch local news, sports and weather for the first time, thanks to
legislation that gives businesses an incentive to offer local
television signals.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a bill Thursday offering $1.25 billion in
federal loan guarantees to entice satellite, cable and wireless
companies to deliver local TV signals to rural areas where millions
can't get them now. That's because the viewers may live outside the
broadcast signal range of local TV stations signals, are in not
served by cable companies or have broadcast satellite subscriptions
that are not yet offering the local channels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because they are small, doesn't mean they should be left
out,'' said Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., one of the authors of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The loan guarantees would be capped at 80 percent. That means
the federal government would promise to cover 80 percent of the
loans if the borrower defaults.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is technologically neutral -- meaning that companies
getting the loan guarantees could use cable, satellite or any other
type of service to deliver the local signals. But satellites may
offer the most cost-effective option, with the ability to cover the
greatest rural area.
</P>
<P>
   The House Commerce Committee has approved a similar bill and the
Agriculture Committee in the House has cleared one that would
guarantee 100 percent of the loans. The House must either merge
those two or pick one before the legislation can advance. The White
House has taken no position on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The loans would have to be approved by a board composed of the
secretaries of Treasury and Agriculture and the chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board. They could choose designees who would have
to be confirmed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers forged agreement Thursday to allow rural cooperatives
to participate -- in addition to lenders insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation -- as long as they meet certain
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said the
bill was structured so that taxpayers would not be placed at
financial risk by the loan guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bill maximizes the chances that the loans will be paid
back,'' said Gramm, who last year blocked action on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment added by Sens. Max Baucus, D-Mont., and Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., also seeks to promote the rollout of high-speed
Internet service -- dozens of times faster than today's dial-up
connections -- to rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   Projects seeking to receive the local TV loan guarantees would
get special consideration if they also provide high-speed Internet
access and National Weather Service information to those
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The measure will help ensure that those in rural communities
''can have the same kind of Internet business, the same kind of
access to information, the same kind of access to education'' as
their urban counterparts, Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rural America does not get nearly the same coverage as urban
America,'' Baucus said. He stressed that faster Internet access is
clearly ''the wave of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The local TV bill stemmed from legislation passed last year
freeing satellite companies for the first time to beam local
channels to their subscribers. So far, providers have focused only
on the nation's largest markets. That leaves 3 million satellite
subscribers -- many in rural regions -- without access to local
channels and millions more who can only get one or two networks.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 97-0-1, with Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., voting
present. Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
did not vote.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Mayor, indicted in bribery case, vows not to resign  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- When Milton Milan was elected mayor of New
Jersey's poorest city three years ago, he pledged put more police
officers on the streets and crack down on crime.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities say that once he was in office, he committed
several crimes himself, collecting more than $30,000 in bribes and
gifts from contractors and mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milan put the office of mayor up for sale. Whatever you needed
from him, you could buy from him,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert J.
Cleary.
</P>
<P>
   Milan yesterday surrendered to authorities after a 19-count
indictment accused him of accepting cash bribes, vacations,
automobiles and home improvement work from individuals and firms
seeking to do business with the city.
</P>
<P>
   The official charges include mail and wire fraud, extortion and
money laundering, for allegedly handling $65,000 in drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also alleges that former mob boss Ralph Natale
and mob associates ''made direct payments of money and other
benefits'' to Milan. Natale has been cooperating with federal
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, a 37-year-old ex-Marine, called the indictment
politically motivated and vowed to be back at work today.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to stay down. I'm going to get back up and
fight. I'm going to continue to be mayor of this city,'' Milan said
after being freed on $150,000 bail. He said he was going right back
to work because ''I still have time on the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic stopped and spectators gawked at the sight of Milan, the
city's first Hispanic mayor, walking to the courthouse to answer
the charges. He is the third mayor of this desperately poor city of
87,000 near Philadelphia to be indicted in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, a first-term Democrat elected in 1997, had been under
scrutiny by federal authorities in a wide-ranging investigation of
alleged corruption in city government. The indictment charges him
with criminal activity dating to March 1996, three months after he
became a city council member.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney said Milan ''was corrupted from the minute he
set foot in City Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor designed this pay-to-play system for his own selfish
benefit, and the people of this city be damned,'' Cleary said.
</P>
<P>
   Milan's name also was mentioned prominently in the recent
federal trial of two men convicted as leaders of a Camden drug
ring. Several witnesses testified that Milan sold drugs in Camden
in the 1980s and bought several shipments of cocaine before
becoming mayor.
</P>
<P>
   However, Camden County prosecutor's spokesman Greg Reinert said
he knew of no pending drug-related case or investigation involving
Milan.
</P>
<P>
   City Council member Ali Sloan-El, a persistent critic of Milan,
termed the federal indictment ''an embarrassment to this city.''
</P>
<P>
   But Milan said the entire matter was ''a political procedure.
What could not be done politically has been turned into a criminal
procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Milan include mail and wire fraud, extortion
and money laundering. If convicted on all counts, he could be
sentenced to up to more than 100 years in prison and face hundreds
of thousands of dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, however, was concentrating on work. Besides that, he
said: ''I'm scheduled to play a little golf.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Candidate Sorry for Remarks  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) -- U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine says
he's of Italian descent and he has the backing of Italian-American
politicians in a state where one out of every four Democrats is,
you guessed it, an Italian-American.
</P>
<P>
   But the former Wall Street executive who is battling former Gov.
Jim Florio for the Democratic nomination is being criticized for
recent remarks that might be considered insulting to Jews -- and
Italians.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he apologized for offending Italian-Americans who
complained his statements perpetuate the stereotype that they are
involved with organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never intended to cause embarrassment. I never intended to
offend,'' Corzine said at a news conference where he accepted the
endorsement of the Unite garment workers' union. ''I shouldn't have
said what I am reported to have said, and if I did, I apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs, is battling
Florio for the nod to succeed Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who
is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   With the primary set for June 6, a Quinnipiac College poll
released Wednesday found Corzine trailing Florio 2-to-1, despite
spending $4 million to grab the public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   He's received plenty of publicity this week.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Alfano, chairman of the Italian-American One Voice
Committee, demanded an apology from Corzine for ''ethnic slurs.''
Alfano said Corzine's first offensive remark was made several
months ago, at a Newark restaurant where he was seeking the support
of six prominent Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   After being introduced to a lawyer named David Stein, Corzine
remarked, ''He's not Italian, is he? Oh, I guess he's your Jewish
lawyer who is here to get the rest of you out of jail,'' according
to Alfano, who wasn't at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Alfano said the second remark occurred two weeks ago when
Corzine met an Italian-American contractor and quipped: ''Oh, you
make cement shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine campaign manager Steven Goldstein said the candidate
''never, ever'' uttered the alleged reference to the ''Jewish
lawyer.'' Stein acknowledged he met Corzine in the past six months,
but doesn't recall the comment.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine didn't dispute the remarks about Italian-Americans,
though he said he doesn't remember the exact wording.
</P>
<P>
   Alfano said Thursday that he has not yet decided who to support
in the campaign, but said the Italian-American stereotypes had to
end.
</P>
<P>
   ''This constant barrage of mob movies,'' he said, ''people think
they can say anything to Italians and we're not going to be
offended.''
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of four national Italian-American groups also said
Corzine's comments showed ''both insensitivity and arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Italian-Americans denounced Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   He found support Thursday from Italian-American politicians
including U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli, state Assembly Minority
Leader Joseph Doria and more than 20 other Italian-American
politicians who said Corzine's apology was ''sincere and
heartfelt.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Florio, also an Italian-American, he said: ''I am proud
of my background.'' To make ''derogatory stereotypes of whole
classifications of people is at a minimum insensitive and at a
maximum is callously stupid.''

<HEADLINE> HUD to Focus on Predatory Lending  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Barbara Mikulski, who got an earful from
Baltimore residents angry about unscrupulous home lending, quickly
passed along their frustrations to a Senate panel.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland Democrat asked why predatory lending is becoming a
''virus,'' spreading across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''The result is the destabilization of neighborhoods. Its
another form of old-fashioned block busting. And it must be
stopped,'' Mikulski said Thursday at a Senate Appropriations
Committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In answer, Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo announced his agency
will propose new laws to fight the discriminatory policies that are
capturing the attention of an increasing number of national
policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan decried the
practice for the first time. Comptroller of the Currency John D.
Hawke Jr., who oversees nationally chartered banks, also criticized
the practice in a speech to a community investment group last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a national crisis,'' Cuomo said, announcing that a task
force will convene next week and make recommendations to Congress
after two months of study. ''This will be the genesis for national
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force will focus on unscrupulous home lending patterns
in a variety of cities including Baltimore, where Cuomo said some
of the worst abuses occur.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed predatory lending by its critics, some mortgage and
home-equity loan companies seek low-income borrowers who have a
hard time securing traditional mortgages and charge extraordinarily
high fees and interest.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, consumer finance companies have taken advantage
of people with low incomes or damaged credit histories, many of
them minorities, who cannot get conventional loans and are
desperate to become homeowners or raise cash by borrowing against
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Another common form of fraud is ''property flipping,'' in which
a property is bought and then resold -- or ''flipped'' -- several
times, each time at a falsely inflated higher price, among a single
group of people.
</P>
<P>
   Also at Thursday's budget hearing, Sen. Christopher S. ''Kit''
Bond, R-Mo., said Cuomo's leadership at the Department of Housing
and Urban Development was to blame for a lack of affordable housing
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, a frequent critic of HUD leadership, said the agency has
attempted to shift the blame for a lack of low-cost housing to
Congress while HUD hasn't done enough to maintain the housing in
its inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Bond also played video clips of news reports that raised
questions on HUD's performance in maintaining its properties.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo called the issues raised by the programs as ''long-term
problems'' at the agency and added he didn't disagree with many of
the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do disagree with people who say we haven't made any
progress,'' Cuomo said.

<HEADLINE> Attorney: Al-Amin Is a Victim  </HEADLINE>
By ASHLEY ESTES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A petition filed by attorneys for Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin claims Georgia officers planted a rifle near the
Alabama field where the former black militant was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The court papers filed in Montgomery Circuit Court contend
Al-Amin, who changed his name from H. Rap Brown, is the victim of a
conspiracy between corrupt law enforcement officers and organized
crime in Atlanta, where he is accused of fatally shooting a deputy.
</P>
<P>
   The petition, filed Wednesday, also claims Al-Amin was
mistreated during his March 20 arrest in Lowndes County.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys have said that Al-Amin is the victim of a
conspiracy and is suffering mistreatment, but the court filing
provided some of the first details of their claims.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents involved in the arrest said the mistreatment claims
were untrue. Georgia authorities have said the conspiracy
allegation is false.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin is charged with murder and aggravated assault in the
March 16 shooting of two Fulton County, Ga., deputies. Deputy Ricky
Kinchen died and Deputy Aldranon English was wounded. The deputies
were attempting to serve Al-Amin with an arrest warrant at his
grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant was issued after Al-Amin failed to appear in court
on charges of theft by receiving stolen property and impersonating
an officer. Those charges stemmed from an incident last May, in
which Al-Amin was allegedly stopped in a stolen car and flashed a
badge.
</P>
<P>
   In the petition, defense attorney said Al-Amin became a target
after he and others attempted to stop an Atlanta drug and
prostitution ring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Corrupt law officers and organized crime elements ... are
engaged in an unlawful conspiracy to deal drugs and violate young
black women on the Metropolitan Parkway, and they want (Al-Amin)
dead,'' the petition said.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut said Georgia officers planted a rifle found near the
site of Al-Amin's capture. The discovery was made ''only after
Georgia officers visited the scene alone and in two vehicles,'' the
petition said.
</P>
<P>
   It claims planting weapons on black suspects is common in large
cities with a high percentage of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the FBI in Mobile on Thursday denied the
allegations, but said he couldn't comment further because the
agency would likely respond to the petition in court. Atlanta
police denied comment, saying the petition didn't specifically
accuse them of anything.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut's petition also criticizes Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman
for signing Al-Amin's extradition papers without investigating the
circumstances surrounding his arrest. Siegelman spokeswoman Carrie
Kurlander said the governor's office followed the law.

By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bail bondsmen and bail insurance companies are
speaking out against a measure that would allow victims of rogue
bounty hunters to sue their pursuers, saying it will ''financially
decimate their companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill ''will create such a virtual deluge of new litigation
as to render these service providers incapable of continuing,''
Jerry Watson of the National Association of Bail Insurance
Companies, told the House Judiciary subcommittee on the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said the measure, which he
authored, would give more protection to victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is truly a problem national in scope,'' Hutchinson said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters don't work for police or courts; they instead
work for private bondsmen, who post bail for suspected criminals
pending a court appearance. When a suspect jumps bail, the bondsman
hires a bounty hunter to find and return the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   But complaints have arisen about heavy-handed behavior by bounty
hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Provisions of Hutchinson's bill would also require bounty
hunters who cross state lines to report their intentions to local
law enforcement authorities and require the attorney general to
develop model guidelines that state legislatures can consider
enacting to regulate bounty hunting.
</P>
<P>
   An exception to liability is provided when a bail agent hires a
licensed bounty hunter or private investigator.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Bounty Hunter Responsibility Act fulfills an important
public safety goal -- namely keeping innocent citizens safe from the
abusive actions of rogue bounty hunters,'' Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla. the subcommittee chairman, said he
hoped the Hutchinson bill would ''afford unsuspecting victims of
rogue bounty hunters and bail bondsmen a federal remedy when their
civil rights have been infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   Laws aimed at regulating bounty hunters have cropped up in more
than a dozen states, including Arizona, Mississippi, New Hampshire
and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bail bondsmen said they supported leaving the matter up to the
states. ''Regulate the bounty hunters at the state level or
prohibit bounty hunters altogether,'' said Armando Roche, president
of the Professional Bail Agents of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's hearing, Theresa Mehalko Babb of Wilmington, N.C.
testified how earlier this month an armed bounty hunter looking for
her brother entered her father's hospital room and later disturbed
the father's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last memories I have of my father's funeral were of
chasing after the bounty hunter and begging him to stop,'' Babb
told lawmakers. ''His grave site looked as though a battle had been
fought there.''

<HEADLINE> China, EU Talks Suspended  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Talks broke down today between Chinese and
European Union negotiators without a market-opening agreement that
would speed China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Despite progress during four days of negotiations, European
Union Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy was leaving Beijing after
deciding that an agreement ''was not possible at this stage,'' said
his spokesman, Anthony Gooch.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years of trying, China has made joining the WTO this
year a priority. But the lack of agreement, even with the
intervention of Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, could slow China's
accession to the Geneva-based body that sets rules for global
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-nation EU is the most important of eight WTO members that
still need to sign off on China's WTO bid. A divided U.S. Congress
was watching the EU talks before deciding whether to signal its
approval for China's WTO entry by granting Beijing permanent
low-tariff trade access.
</P>
<P>
   No date or place was set for future talks, Gooch said. But he
said the EU still hoped to see China join the WTO ''at the earliest
available opportunity.'' China's commitment to a deal with the EU
remains ''as strong as it was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   China's official Xinhua News Agency confirmed that talks had
ended and said both sides ''made great efforts'' to reach
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The talks are positive, constructive and fruitful,'' Xinhua
quoted the foreign trade ministry as saying. ''Both sides hope to
reach agreement as soon as possible, and the negotiations will
continue in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamy's Chinese counterpart, foreign trade minister Shi
Guangsheng, welcomed him to return to Beijing for more talks,
Xinhua said, without proposing a date.
</P>
<P>
   Gooch said Lamy showed ''significant flexibility during the
talks,'' and that both sides made concessions ''resulting in a
certain narrowing of differences.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to make progress across the board,'' Gooch said. ''The
issues on the table are complex. They take time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooch would not give details on sticking points. But Europe was
seeking greater access to China's automobile, insurance and
telecommunications markets and more licenses for insurers. Among
Europe's demands was reportedly that foreigners be allowed a
controlling 51 percent stake in telecommunications ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans had on Thursday given the Chinese proposals to
ponder overnight, and Gooch had said late Thursday that EU
negotiators would remain in Beijing ''as long as it's
constructive.'' The EU pullout showed the divide was too great for
the Europeans to stay on.
</P>
<P>
   The talks had opened amid optimism. Unlike two previous rounds
this year, Lamy led the delegation, a sign negotiations were down
to thorny political matters. Lamy met Wednesday with Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji, another sign that both sides were seeking
breakthroughs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: GOP Congress Has 'No Shame'  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says it takes ''real gall''
for Republicans to torpedo the nuclear test ban treaty, then fault
him when India and Pakistan spurn his pleas to end their nuclear
weapons rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   In a trio of speeches in New York City on Thursday that raised
$1.7 million for the Democratic National Committee, Clinton
portrayed Republicans as choosing the wrong side on a long list of
issues, including the economy, taxes, the future of Medicare and
Social Security, and gun safety.
</P>
<P>
   But he became unusually personal when he responded to criticism
by congressional Republicans that he had failed to broker a nuclear
weapons pact between arch enemies Pakistan and India during his
South Asia trip last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have no guilt and no shame,'' the president said of his
GOP critics. ''I mean, they'll say anything. ... You never see them
blink about it.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Whip Tom DeLay and other congressional
Republicans triggered Clinton's remarks when they said he has
little or nothing to show for his week of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said of Delay: ''What he didn't point out is that I lost
all the leverage I had when the Republican Senate defeated the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought, that is real gall,'' Clinton said. ''Man, for a guy
to stand up and say that. That requires a lot of moxie, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton lost a bitter, 51-48 vote for ratification of
the test ban treaty. Only four Senate Republicans voted for the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The United States thus became the first nuclear power to
specifically reject the 154-nation agreement on ending nuclear
weapons testing, and Clinton called the vote ''reckless
partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Both India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in 1998. They
also have tested medium-range and short-range missiles since then.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called GOP opposition to the test ban ''stunning'' and
incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be folly for us to walk away from arms
control,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking more generally, the president said some congressional
Republicans tell him that they vote against certain administration
policies because they fear losing ground in the congressional power
structure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had these Republicans come up to me in virtual tears and
apologize for the way they were voting on first on one thing and
then another, and just say they had to do it because they didn't
want to lose their committee position,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized Texas Gov. George Bush, the apparent GOP
presidential nominee, for opposing hate crimes legislation in his
state after the murder of a Texas man, James Bird. Bird was chained
to the back of a pickup truck and dragged to death.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attributed Bush's lack of support to Republican fears
that such legislation would be extended to include crimes targeting
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''All he had to do was to lift his hand and they would have had
a hate crimes bill,'' Clinton said of Bush. ''And it did not pass
because they (Republicans) did not want it to pass. Because they do
not believe that gays and lesbians should be protected by hate
crimes legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his campaign to persuade Congress to pass gun safety
legislation, Clinton said he is undisturbed by attacks against him
on that issue by the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about me and the NRA; this is about whether people
stay alive or not,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Joins GOP Criticism of Census  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While Census officials and some lawmakers say
they're concerned that many American families may refuse to
complete the Census 2000 long form, GOP presidential candidate
George W. Bush said he's not sure he would fill it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want as accurate a count as possible but I can understand
why people don't want to give over that information to the
government,'' Bush said Thursday during a campaign stop in
Milwaukee. ''And if I have the long form, I'm not sure I would
either.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor didn't advise people not to complete the
form. But he said, ''If they're worried about the government
intruding into their personal lives, they ought to think about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt chided several
congressional Republicans for telling constituents to ignore what
they consider intrusive Census questions and said their opposition
was motivated by politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said Democrats ''haven't gotten criticism'' about the
form but Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle said his office has
been getting questions about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republicans have been trying to frustrate this census from
the beginning,'' said Gephardt. ''They don't want more people
counted because they think it serves their political purpose.
That's a pretty shoddy reason to do what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, the spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, said that if Gephardt's not getting calls, ''I think he's the
only member of Congress who isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's office and at least two House Republicans said they had
received a number of complaints in recent days about questions on
census forms. Reps. Nick Smith, R-Mich. and Tom Coburn, R-Okla.,
were specifically critical of the long-form questionnaire, sent to
one in six of the country's 115 million households.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Czwartacki said that Lott has been heavily
promoting the census in his state, but was also suggesting to
callers concerned about privacy to leave unanswered those questions
they felt were intrusive and mail it back to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, D-S.D., said, ''It is of concern, I think, to people
that the questions asked and the length of time required has made
it somewhat problematic.'' Daschle said he has advised people not
to skip questions. ''I'm not sure that it is anything that we ought
to address, at least at this point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have long supported incorporating a statistical method
known as sampling to raw census numbers. Sampling would adjust
actual head counts to account for populations with traditionally
low response rates, such as minority groups in cities. Republican
lawmakers have opposed sampling, fearing it could force a redrawing
of boundary lines to their disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki said Lott has done television and radio ads
encouraging census participation. But he added it was better to
leave questions unanswered because ''if the choice is between the
trash can and partially filling it out, we're going to tell people
to fill out as much as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Census director Kenneth Prewitt said the long form is an
''essential tool'' to help communities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even questions that some Republicans labeled as intrusive, such
as ''how old is your home'' and ''are you a veteran?'' are useful
to determine how local services are provided, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 53 questions on the long form this year, down from 57
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress received a detailed list of the questions
two years ago from the Census Bureau and had a chance to weigh in,
said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., ranking member of the House
Government Reform Committee's census panel.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Hip Fractures Are Increasing  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Hip fractures among women 65 and older climbed 40
percent between 1988 and 1996 and fully one-third of older
Americans suffer serious falls each year, according to government
research.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed
the increase in part to a growing number of people 85 and older.
</P>
<P>
   People are living longer because of advances against such
killers as heart disease, stroke and cancer. But older people run a
higher risk of falls because they are generally more sedentary,
have weaker muscles and poorer balance, and take more medication
that can make them dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   More adults 65 and older die from fall-related injuries each
year than from any other kind of injury. The CDC said 9,000 such
deaths occurred in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   According to the CDC report released Thursday, 340,000 people 65
or older were hospitalized in 1996 with a broken hip. Of those, 80
percent were women.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the rate of hospitalization among women 65 and older
was 972 per 100,000. By 1996, it had climbed to 1,356 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that one in three older adults requires
hospitalization for a fall each year, with a broken hip the most
common and serious injury. Half of those who break a hip do not
regain their former level of mobility or independence, ending up in
a nursing home or moving in with relatives, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hip fractures can really mark the beginning of the end for
seniors,'' said Judy Stevens, a CDC epidemiologist. ''It can lead
quickly to decline and death.''
</P>
<P>
   America had 31 million people 65 and older in 1990. That number
is expected to more than double by 2040.
</P>
<P>
   Older adults are hospitalized for fall-related injuries five
times more often than for other injuries, and women are nearly
three times more likely than men to be hospitalized for falls, the
CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC suggests older people remove clutter and throw rugs from
their homes, and exercise to increase muscle strength and balance.

<HEADLINE> Guard at state prison camp killed in logging accident; trooper enroute crashes, kills woman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GEORGETOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- A 70-year-old woman was killed when the
car she was riding in was hit by a state trooper, who was
responding to a logging accident that left a state prison guard
dead.
</P>
<P>
   William Lockwood, 72, was making a U-turn on the crest of a hill
when the accident happened Thursday morning about 20 miles from
where the fatal logging accident occurred. The trooper, who was not
identified, was driving with his lights and sirens on, Madison
County deputies said.
</P>
<P>
   The trooper was unable to avoid the Lockwood's car, which was
turning into the path of the trooper's car, deputies said. The
police car hit the side of the Lockwood's station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood suffered only minor injuries but his wife, Shirley,
sustained head trauma and internal injuries from the impact. She
was pronounced dead at St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Utica at
12:17 p.m. The trooper was evaluated for foot and hand pain.
</P>
<P>
   The accident is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The trooper was on his way to a state wildlife management area
to help investigate the death of Raymond J. Curtis, 53, of Eaton, a
corrections officer who was supervising an eight-member inmate work
crew from nearby Camp Georgetown, a minimum-security prison.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates said Curtis slipped and fell while carrying a log on his
shoulders. Curtis hit his head on a tree stump and the log then
landed on his head.
</P>
<P>
   ''The call came in as an accident but we're not satisfied with
that call until we do a complete investigation,'' Madison County
Undersheriff Doug Bailey said today. ''We're trying to piece this
whole thing together.''
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy was planned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates were trimming trees and thinning the woods in the
Tioughnioga State Wildlife Management area, about 30 miles
southeast of Syracuse. The accident happened in a ravine about 150
feet from the road.
</P>
<P>
   An inmate called other guards to the area, but Curtis was
pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis had been a guard for 10 years, including the past five at
Camp Georgetown.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up 79 points
in today's early going. Advancing issues on the New York Stock
Exchange hold a 7-4 lead over decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead 91 points and the Standard &AMP;

</P>
<P>
   Wall Street will see if it can keep the Nasdaq's losing streak
to just four sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-dominated index has sold off each day this week,
with sharp declines the past three sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say many investors have decided to sell some of their
high-tech holdings, locking in dramatic gains that have been
realized already this year.
</P>
<P>
   That selling has sent the Nasdaq nearly 12 percent below its
March tenth closing high.
</P>
<P>
   Some market-watchers say this week's selling, as nerve-wracking
as it has been, was needed to clean out some of the market's
excesses.

<HEADLINE> URGENT  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Business machines giant Xerox Corp. is
cutting 5,200 jobs and taking a $625 million first-quarter charge,
saying it can ''no longer operate business as usual and expect to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Struggling with stiff competition and a difficult reorganization
of its sales force, Xerox said it is narrowing its focus to two
core markets: business machines such as copiers and printers for
home and medium-sized offices, and larger documents systems for big
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts represent about 5 percent of the company's
worldwide work force.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox President and Chief Executive Rick Thoman said the
marketplace has changed from the days when Xerox was a leader in
photocopying technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''While these are difficult actions for our people, Xerox can no
longer operate business as usual and expect to win,'' he said.
''We're intensifying our drive to become a faster, leaner and more
flexible enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The cuts were not unexpected. Xerox said in January that an
overhaul was coming, and analysts this week had predicted job cuts
and a restructuring charge in the neighborhood of $500 million to
$900 million.
</P>
<P>
   Today's announcement is Xerox's fourth major restructuring in
the last decade. In 1998, the company took a $1.1 billion charge
and cut about 9,000 jobs in another reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox said none of the cuts in the latest overhaul will affect
its sales or research and development efforts. The charge includes
about $175 million for closing facilities and scrapping some of its
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the cuts would affect all levels and geographic
areas. Details will need to be hashed out among business groups,
unions, government and local leadership, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the past two years, we have made progress in improving
productivity and reducing general and administrative expenses. But
we need to go further,'' Thoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox spokesman Jeff Simek said some jobs will be cut from the
company's headquarters in Stamford, but he would not say how many.
Xerox currently employs about 600 at its headquarters, plus another
400 at offices in Hartford and Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   The company's profits fell 52 percent in the fourth quarter, to
$294 million, or 41 cents per share, compared with $615 million, or
84 cents per share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues in the quarter fell 6 percent to $5.44 billion from
$5.79 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said it expects to see another decline in
earnings in the first quarter, which ends today.
</P>
<P>
   Specific steps the company plans to take include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Streamlining production, including moving factories to areas
where certain products are most in demand.
</P>
<P>
   -- Consolidating warehouses and distribution centers and
eliminating backed-up inventory.
</P>
<P>
   -- Improved customer service.
</P>
<P>
   -- Combining support services for marketing, finance and human
resources.
</P>
<P>
   -- And improving Internet-based communications and support both
inside the company and for customers.

<HEADLINE> CDC Reports Rise in Dengue Fever  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Cases of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne tropical
disease marked by excruciating muscle and joint pain, rose sharply
in the United States from 1993 to 1998, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Increased travel, especially to the Caribbean and Central
America, led to the dramatic rise, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC recorded 90 cases of imported, laboratory-confirmed
cases of dengue fever in 1998, up from a total of 46 in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   Dengue fever is characterized by the sudden onset of high fever,
severe headaches, severe joint and muscle pain, nausea, vomiting
and a rash. About 5 percent of those infected die.
</P>
<P>
   Dengue, also called break-bone fever, is transmitted by the bite
of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, dengue was diagnosed in 22 travelers from New York, 12
from Massachusetts and eight from Maryland, the CDC reported.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers to tropical areas should use mosquito repellants, wear
protective clothing and stay in well-screened or air-conditioned
areas, the CDC said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 42.48; Dow Up 4.96  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today as investors searched
for bargains following a harrowing day for technology and Internet
issues on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading, the Nasdaq composite index was up
42.48 at 4,500.37 after skidding nearly 187 points on Thursday. The
Nasdaq, which is dominated by techology issues, is still considered
to be in correction territory, defined as a drop of 10 percent or
more.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 4.96 at 10,985.21. And
the Standard &AMP; Poor's index was up 6.78 at 1,494.70.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to bargain hunting, investors also were reacting to
two economic reports released this morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported that personal income rose 0.4
percent in February but that Americans' spending rose more than
twice as fast. That pulled the nation's savings rate down to an
all-time monthly low.
</P>
<P>
   In a second report, orders to U.S. factories were down for the
second straight month, falling a smaller-than-expected 0.8 percent
in February. Orders for airplanes and other transportation
equipment took their biggest plunge in 10 months, dropping 8.9
percent. Industrial machinery orders fell 4.8 percent, the steepest
decline since October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In corporate news, shares of drkoop.com, the online health
information provider, fell 43 percent, or by 2 47/64, to 3 33/64
after auditors questioned the viability of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Net2Phone jumped 11 percent on news an investor group
led by AT&AMP;T is buying a 32 percent stake the provider of cheap
long-distance calls over the Internet. Shares of Net2Phone were up
6] at 61}.
</P>
<P>
   Other big winners in morning trading included Intel, up 4 11/16
at 131 11/16, and Qualcom, up 3 16/64 at 148{.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining by almost five to three
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 137.98 million
shares, up from 136.56 million the same time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small company stocks was up 3.58 at
535.15.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.51 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.55 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.29 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.13 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Labor activists are ''shocked and
surprised'' that some restaurant and tavern workers could see their
minimum wage go up by just 40 cents, and not the 62 additional
cents an hour they expected starting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A bill passed by the state Legislature and signed into law by
Gov. George Pataki Thursday set the state minimum wage for those
workers at $3.30 an hour, up from the $2.90 an hour they have been
entitled to, but not the $3.52 an hour they could have received
starting April 1 without the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The higher raise for tipped workers was originally approved by
the Legislature in December as part of a bill increasing wages for
farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the hospitality industry objected to a $3.52-an-hour wage.
Restaurant and tavern owners complained that since those workers
are pocketing tips from patrons, their actual wages are well past
the state or federal minimums.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are outraged that the Legislature would choose to take this
amount of money -- 22 cents -- away from the lowest wage earners in
the state,'' said Mario Cilento, a spokesman for the state AFL-CIO.
''They've turned their backs on these hardworking men and women.
It's shocking that they wouldn't take into concern the real needs
of the lowest wage earners in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly held a sometimes heated debate on the bill, which
the chairwoman of the Assembly's labor committee, Queens Democrat
Catherine Nolan, defended.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan told her colleagues if they did not pass the legislation,
the workers would be unlikely to see any increase. She said since
both chambers have passed the $3.30 legislation, it is likely to
become law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think $3.30 is a big step forward,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But others strongly disagreed, saying it was unfair of
legislators to take away what had been ''promised'' to workers,
especially two days before the raise would have taken effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is probably the most ludicrous thing I've ever seen,''
said David Townsend Jr., a Republican from Oneida County. ''It's
unheard of. When did we ever take money away from anybody? If
someone told you you'd get a raise, you'd expect it to be there.
This is crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Grannis, a Democrat from Manhattan, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is, if not improper, then immoral,'' he said. ''I
think this is the wrong thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The December farm worker bill increased the state's minimum wage
from $4.25 an hour to the federal minimum wage of $5.15 an hour. It
also mandated any change to the federal minimum wage automatically
apply to the farm worker's state minimum wage -- effectively
abolishing the state's lower minimum wage for those workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Policy Management Systems Corp., a maker
of insurance and financial services software, said late Thursday it
had agreed to sell almost all of the company to a New York
investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh Carson Anderson and Stowe will spend $604 million to buy
between 75 percent and 93 percent of the Blythewood-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders, who have seen the stock languish between $8 and $9
a share since February can sell their stock for $14 a share or they
can keep it. PMSC shareholders must agree to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the
shares were at $12.37{, up $3.62{, or 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock traded at more than $50 last year and
shareholders are suing the company because of the lost value.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, PMSC reported a $72 million loss for 1999 because
of write-offs on older software products. It had earned $53.3
million the previous year. Revenues for 1999 were up 6 percent at
$644 million.
</P>
<P>
   PMSC, which had previously said it would change its name to Mynd
to reflect its changing focus to Internet business, has fought

<HEADLINE> Xerox To Cut 5,200 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Business machines giant Xerox Corp. said
today it was cutting 5,200 jobs, or 5 percent of its work force,
saying it can ''no longer operate business as usual and expect to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Struggling with stiff competition and a difficult reorganization
of its sales force, Xerox said it was narrowing its focus to two
core markets: business machines such as copiers for home and
medium-sized offices, and larger documents systems for big
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   It plans to charge $625 million against earnings in the first
quarter as a result of the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox president Rick Thoman said the marketplace has changed
from the days when Xerox was a leader in photocopying technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''While these are difficult actions for our people, Xerox can no
longer operate business as usual and expect to win,'' he said.
''We're intensifying our drive to become a faster, leaner and more
flexible enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The cuts were not unexpected. Xerox said in January that an
overhaul was coming, and analysts this week had predicted job cuts
and a restructuring charge in the neighborhood of $500 million to
$900 million.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Xerox shares
were up 6.25 cents at $26.62{ a share.
</P>
<P>
   Today's announcement is Xerox's fourth major restructuring in
the last decade. In 1998, the company took a $1.1 billion charge
and cut about 9,000 jobs in another reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox said none of the cuts in the latest overhaul will affect
its sales or research and development efforts. The charge includes
about $175 million for closing facilities and scrapping some of its
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the job cuts would affect all levels and
geographic areas, with more than half coming from offices in the
United States. Details will need to be hashed out among business
groups, unions, government and local leadership, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the past two years, we have made progress in improving
productivity and reducing general and administrative expenses. But
we need to go further,'' Thoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox currently has a worldwide work force of 94,600. Spokesman
Jeff Simek said jobs will be eliminated across the board, but will
be felt most deeply -- on a percentage basis -- in middle- and
upper-management.
</P>
<P>
   Simek said some jobs will be cut from the company's headquarters
in Stamford, but he would not say how many. Xerox currently employs
about 600 at its headquarters, plus another 400 at offices in
Hartford and Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Simek said the facility closings will include some manufacturing
plants, as well as warehouse and distribution facilities. He would
not say where plants will be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised the move, saying Xerox has to make the cutbacks
to compete with Hewlett-Packard and Canon.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are going to try their best to compete in any way
possible, not just by cutting but also by announcing new
products,'' said Marjorie Saint-Aime, an analyst with brokerage
firm Pittsburg Institutional Inc. ''They are going in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's profits fell 52 percent in the fourth quarter, to
$294 million, or 41 cents per share, compared with $615 million, or
84 cents per share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues in the quarter fell 6 percent to $5.44 billion from
$5.79 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said it expects to see another decline in
earnings in the first quarter, which ends today.
</P>
<P>
   Specific steps the company plans to take include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Streamlining production, including moving factories to areas
where certain products are most in demand.
</P>
<P>
   -- Consolidating warehouses and distribution centers and
eliminating backed-up inventory.
</P>
<P>
   -- Improved customer service.
</P>
<P>
   -- Combining support services for marketing, finance and human
resources.
</P>
<P>
   -- And improving Internet-based communications and support both
inside the company and for customers.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 3.24; Dow Up 4.96 heads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mixed today as investors remained
uneasy about prospects for technology and Internet issues following
Thursday's big selloff.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading, the Nasdaq composite index was down
3.24 at 4,454.65 after dropping 187 points on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 4.96 at
10,985.21. And the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 4.02 at
1,491.94.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were reacting to two economic reports released this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported that personal income rose 0.4
percent in February but that Americans' spending rose more than
twice as fast. That pulled the nation's savings rate down to an
all-time monthly low.
</P>
<P>
   In a second report, orders to U.S. factories were down for the
second straight month, falling a smaller-than-expected 0.8 percent
in February. Orders for airplanes and other transportation
equipment took their biggest plunge in 10 months, dropping 8.9
percent. Industrial machinery orders fell 4.8 percent, the steepest
decline since October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In corporate news, shares of drkoop.com, the online health
information provider, fell 47 percent, or by 2 15/16, to 3 1/32
after auditors questioned the viability of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Another loser was Conseco, which was down about 18 percent after
the insurance and financial-services company said it will record a
$350 million charge and may sell its consumer finance unit. Shares
were down 2 1/5 at 11 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   However, shares of Net2Phone jumped 11 percent on news an
investor group led by AT&AMP;T is buying a 32 percent stake the
provider of cheap long-distance calls over the Internet. Shares of
Net2Phone were up 5\ at 60|.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining by almost five to three
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 310.19 million
shares, down from 345.22 million the same time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small company stocks was up 1.09 at
532.66.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on USDA Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were sharply
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   The market received a boost from the U.S. Agriculture
Department's quarterly stocks and acreage report, released before
the start of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The government reports wheat stocks total 1.4 billion bushels as
of March 1. Analysts say that is smaller than the market expected.
The USDA also estimates 14.8 million acres of wheat will be planted
this year, down from last year's 15.3 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   The news was a boost to wheat futures prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department's report is considered neutral for
corn futures, yet those prices also rose. There is concern about
inadequate rainfall as the planting of the corn crop gets underway.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean futures soared as the USDA reported soybean stocks
totaled 1.39 billion bushels, lower than analysts estimates of 1.4
billion bushels. Weather concerns also helped lift soybeans higher.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery was 3{ cents higher at $2.59 a bushel;
May corn was 3{ cents higher at $2.36} a bushel; May oats were 2
cents higher a $1.23 a bushel; May soybeans were 10 cents higher at
$5.47{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle futures prices were higher and pork futures prices were
mixed in trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Live cattle were .05 cent higher at 71.90 cents a pound; April
feeder cattle were .15 cent higher at 83.95 cents a pound; April
lean hogs were .88 cent higher at 64.15 cents a pound; May pork
bellies were .65 cent lower a 96.55 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 45.86; Dow Up 14.89  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors extended
their weeklong sell-off of technology shares.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading, the Nasdaq composite index was down 45.86 at
4,412.03 after dropping 187 points on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After opening higher, stocks quickly returned to a now familiar
pattern: when technology stocks fall out of favor, investors shift
their attentions to the so-called ''old economy'' stocks that
dominate the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Dow average was up 14.89 at 10,995.14, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 1.05 at 1,488.97.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to digesting the effects of Thursday's broad
selloff, investors were reacting to two economic reports released
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported that personal income rose 0.4
percent in February but that Americans' spending rose more than
twice as fast. That pulled the nation's savings rate down to an

in February. Orders for airplanes and other transportation
equipment took their biggest plunge in 10 months, dropping 8.9
percent. Industrial machinery orders fell 4.8 percent, the steepest
decline since October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In corporate news, shares of drkoop.com, the online health
information provider, fell 47 percent, or by 2 15/16, to 3 1/32
after auditors questioned the viability of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet company hit hard was Ariba, which helps
companies track sales on the Web. The stock was down 35 9/16 at 184
7/16 after a Prudential Securities analyst downgraded the stock to
accumulate from strong buy.
</P>
<P>
   Providing some balance to the Nasdaq, however, was CheckFree
Holdings, up 9 9/16 to 70 9/16 after a Lehman Brothers analyst
issued a ''buy'' rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several Nasdaq stalwarts were also higher,
including Dell Computer, up 1\ at 53 7/16, and Intel, up 2~ at
129~.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco fell about 18 percent after the insurance and financial
services company said it will record a $350 million charge and may
sell its consumer finance unit. Shares were down 2 11/16 at 11.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining by four to three on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 460.23 million
shares, down from 510.73 million the same time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small company stocks was down 3.89 at

<HEADLINE> UPS Agrees To Create 4,000 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service has agreed to create 4,000
new full-time jobs this spring, ending its dispute with the
Teamsters union over a 1997 contract.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, which brought an end to the 1997 Teamsters strike
against UPS, called for the company create 2,000 full-time jobs
each year for five years. But the company said package volume was
badly damaged by the strike, making the job-creation requirement
invalid for 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In February, an arbitrator ordered UPS to create 2,000 full-time
jobs for the first year of the contract. Now UPS has agreed to
create another 2,000 for the second year, according to papers filed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   All 4,000 new jobs will be created by June 10 and offered to
current part-time employees, UPS spokesman Norman Black said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based UPS employs 344,000 workers, 117,500 of them in
part-time positions.

<HEADLINE> CSX Rail System Found Dangerous  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concerned about a series of derailments,
federal railroad inspectors found deteriorating track conditions in
the CSX Transportation system used by passenger, freight and
commuter trains up and down the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   CSX President Ronald Conway ''was very appropriately appalled by
what we have found ... and he committed to work very diligently to
address those concerns,'' George Gavalla, the Federal Railroad
Administration's associate administrator for safety, said today.
</P>
<P>
   Gavalla said his agency had audited CSX in 1997 and became
concerned because it hadn't seen a reduction in derailments and
other problems. A new safety audit was launched in February.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main concern was the lack of quality control in CSX track
inspection maintenance programs,'' Gavalla said. He said the
railroad has promised to initiate safety programs that go beyond
federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Problems were found in track conditions used by Amtrak and
commuter rail lines and in one case insufficient repairs were made
following a derailment, Gavalla said.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found a 60 percent increase in track-caused accidents
over five years on the 22,700-mile system, according to a report in
The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The review found many instances in which the distance between
the rails had spread wide enough to risk derailments.
</P>
<P>
   Two such wide areas were found in the District of Columbia on
the line used by Amtrak, Virginia Railway Express and all
north-south CSX freight trains. The defects were repaired
immediately after they were found.
</P>
<P>
   Defects were also found in Florida, Pennsylvania and Maryland
</P>
<P>
   Two of three recent track-caused derailments were caused by wide
track, including a minor derailment of Amtrak's Chicago-Washington
Capitol Limited at Connellsville, Pa., on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Federal safety standards dictate the conditions of railroad
track including the gauge, or distance between tracks. Railroads
are supposed to inspect their tracks twice a week and, when
problems are found, either make immediate repairs or slow traffic
over the area until it can be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   The special safety audit is not a rare event, Gavalla said. ''We
always have inspectors on every railroad virtually every day.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Coke Gets Settlement Offer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. has reportedly received a
detailed settlement offer by plaintiffs in a race discrimination
lawsuit against the soft-drink giant and is preparing its response.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would discuss the offer which was reported Friday
by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The report offered no details
of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the trustee of the New York State Common Retirement
Fund, which owns $370 million in Coke stock, wrote Chairman Doug
Daft that ''this lawsuit has already damaged Coca-Cola's reputation
and its shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important that you take the steps necessary to halt this
damage and strengthen Coca-Cola's commitment to tolerance and
inclusion in the work place,'' New York Comptroller H. Carl McCall
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was sent because of McCall's irritation with the
decline of the company's share price by more than 20 percent since
Jan. 1and its inability to end the litigation, McCall spokesman
Jeffrey Gordon said. The fund owns 7.4 million Coke shares.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Ware, the company's highest-ranking black executive, called
McCall on Thursday and scheduled a meeting with him next week in
New York. Coke has a conference with analysts Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're always attentive to the concerns of our shareholders,''
Coke spokesman Chuck Reece said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Rev. Jesse Jackson left Atlanta Thursday after
two days of meetings with Coke officials in which he pressed the
company to settle the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, president of the Rainbow/Push Coalition, was joined at
Thursday's meeting by Larry Jones, a former company manager who is
organizing a bus ''ride for justice'' to Coca-Cola's annual meeting
in Delaware on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   The federal suit, filed by eight current and former employees,
claims Atlanta-based Coke has discriminated against blacks in pay,
promotions and performance evaluations. The company has denied the
allegations and is fighting efforts to have the suit declared a
class action, enveloping 2,000 plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with a federal mediator concerning the lawsuit are
scheduled for April 17-18. Daft has said the company is ''working
toward an expedient and equitable resolution'' of the suit.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Hunter Opposes Cockfighting  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Collin Peterson, a pro-hunting, pro-trapping
congressman from rural Minnesota, may seem a strange ally for the
Humane Society of the United States, but the two have joined forces
against one target: cockfighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anyone would label me an animal rights person,''
said Peterson, co-chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen Caucus.
''I have a zero record from PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals) and these groups. I'm for trapping; we have mink
farming in my district.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ''I wouldn't want to see dogs fighting to the
death, and this (cockfighting) isn't something we should be doing
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, a Democrat, is sponsoring legislation that would ban
the interstate transport of birds for cockfighting. In the matches,
birds wear razor-sharp implements and often spar to the death.
Onlookers often place bets on which bird will win.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law allows fighting roosters to be shipped from any of
the 47 states where cockfighting is illegal to one of the three
where it isn't -- New Mexico, Oklahoma and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials in states where the sport is illegal
say that is a loophole that makes their job more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 senators and 170 House members have signed on as
co-sponsors to the legislation. The Senate version -- sponsored by
Colorado Republican Wayne Allard, Congress' only veterinarian --
passed the Agriculture Committee last month.
</P>
<P>
   But Peterson has been unable to get a hearing in the House
Agriculture Committee's livestock and horticulture subcommittee,
due at least in part to a lobbying effort by opponents, led by the
American Animal Husbandry Coalition, the trade organization for
gamefowl breeders.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition hired two former senators to lobby against the
bill: Steve Symms, R-Idaho, and J. Bennett Johnston, D-La. They
claim passage will lead to more restrictions involving animals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people that are pushing the bill -- PETA and the Humane
Society -- next they'll outlaw rodeos and horse racing,'' Symms
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sportsmen like Peterson, the Humane Society has
collected the endorsements of dozens of law enforcement groups to
try to counter arguments that it has a broader agenda with the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cockfights are cruel and inhumane,'' James L. Vermeersch,
executive director of the Missouri Sheriffs' Association, wrote in
a letter seeking support from Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo.
''Roosters are drugged with stimulants to increase their
aggressiveness, fitted with razor-sharp implements on their legs,
and placed in a pit where they are forced to fight to the death.''
</P>
<P>
   Symms said chickens raised for food don't fare much better.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hatch a bird and grow it in a cage where it never walks
outside for four or five months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Symms also said fighting roosters are raised primarily for
export to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the people who grow these birds are farmers,'' he
said. ''The big bulk of these birds are shipped to Hawaii and then
to Southeast Asia. If this bill passes, it would stop hundreds of
millions of dollars of exports, and put honest farmers out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one thing to say we're against this, it's inhumane, and
another to be holier-than-thou and say we shouldn't allow them to
fight in other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Allard said the legislation would not ban exports.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may have an impact on a few growers, but it will have a
minimal impact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome of the bill, cockfighting may soon be
legal in one less state. Oklahomans will vote this fall on a
referendum to ban cockfighting, and a recent poll showed
overwhelming support for the measure.

<HEADLINE> OPEC President Sets Target Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez,
who is the new president of OPEC, said Friday that the cartel plans
to maintain a price range of $22 a barrel to $28 a barrel for the
OPEC basket of crudes.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's proposal for a price-band system -- frequent supply
changes designed to keep oil prices within a set range -- was
accepted by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries during their meeting earlier this week in Vienna,
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez told a news conference that if the basket price moves
outside the target range for 20 consecutive days, OPEC will
increase or decrease production by 500,000 barrels a day until the
price moves back within the stipulated band.
</P>
<P>
   He said the 500,000-barrel output change would be divided among
the member nations based on their individual production quotas.
Venezuela's portion amounts to 11.8 percent or 59,000 barrels a
day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC keeps watch on prices by calculating the value of a
''basket'' of seven different crude oils. The year-to-date average
basket price is $26.24, which is about the level being bid for
future deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, crude for delivery in May was priced at $26.67 on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, while front-month Brent crude from
the North Sea was at $24.98 on the International Petroleum Exchange
in London.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was a key negotiator in helping to bring about the
agreement in Vienna that raised oil output to ease prices down from
nine-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   Including Iran, which reversed its initial decision not to raise
output, the cartel is expected to increase production by about 1.7
million barrels a day, or more than 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Taking into account non-OPEC members Mexico and Norway's
decision to increase production -- and the probability of continued
cheating on quotas by major producers -- the total increase is
likely to reach about 2 million barrels a day. That's the level
sought by the United States and other oil-importing nations that
were under pressure from consumers angry over steep gasoline and
heating oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said Friday that Venezuela will raise its own
production by 125,000 barrels a day within a month.

<HEADLINE> Judge Johnson Probe Launched  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five judges will launch a full-scale inquiry
into why the chief federal judge in the District of Columbia sent
prosecutions of presidential friends and fund-raisers to judges
appointed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a complaint alleging judicial misconduct, federal
appeals Judge Stephen Williams chose three Republicans and a
Clinton appointee to help him delve into the conduct of Chief Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson of the U.S. District Court. She bypassed the
computerized system of randomly assigning cases in directing six
prosecutions in the Whitewater and campaign fund-raising scandals
to Clinton-appointed judges.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative group, Judicial Watch, filed a complaint against
Johnson last summer after The Associated Press revealed that
prosecutions against Clinton fund-raiser Charlie Trie and long-time
presidential friend Webster Hubbell were assigned to Clinton
appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Williams threw out the complaint, but it was reopened after Rep.
Howard Coble, R-N.C., presented additional evidence that besides
the Trie and Hubbell cases, Johnson had sent four other
fund-raising cases to Clinton appointees.
</P>
<P>
   The other cases included the guilty plea of prominent Miami
businessman Howard Glicken, a former fund-raiser for Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The chief judge has never publicly explained why she bypassed
the random assignment system in Glicken's case. In a letter to a
newspaper last summer, Johnson said she made the special
assignments to ''move the docket as expeditiously as possible'' and
that politics was ''never a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Tuesday to Judicial Watch and Coble, the federal
appeals court listed the four judges on the panel. Under court
rules, Williams, a Reagan appointee, also will sit on the panel.
The four Washington-based judges named to the panel are:
</P>
<P>
   --Judith W. Rogers, a Clinton appointee on the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   --A. Raymond Randolph, a Bush appointee in the same circuit.
</P>
<P>
   --U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan, a Reagan appointee.
</P>
<P>
   --U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, a Reagan
appointee.

<HEADLINE> More Census Responses Sought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As lawmakers squabble over the intrusiveness
of questions, Census Bureau officials hope those who haven't yet
mailed back their forms will do so Saturday, Census Day.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau sent questionnaires to the country's 115 million
households in March, but officially they want to know how many
people are living in your home on April 1. That is because the
once-a-decade count must be tied to a specific point in time.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, 49 percent of census forms were mailed back.
Census officials hoped to get 70 percent of the forms back by late
April.
</P>
<P>
   Several congressional Republicans grumbled this week about the
intrusiveness of census forms, citing complaints from constituents
that the questionnaire invaded their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate majority
leader, said they strongly urged people to return forms but
suggested that callers worried about privacy could leave intrusive
questions unanswered. That was a better solution than not returning
a form, Lott's staff said.
</P>
<P>
   Census director Kenneth Prewitt said he was unsure how the
controversy would affect the willingness of people to completely
fill out and return forms. Census officials were hoping for a spike
in the response rate after April 1, thinking some people may have
held on to their forms until then.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Gets $2.2B in New Orders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. has received about $2.2 billion in new
orders from two airlines, including the first orders for its new
777-300X model.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Airlines Co. Ltd. will take possession of the first
777-300X by 2004, with seven more to be delivered by 2008, Boeing
said Friday. Boeing did not give a value for the eight-plane order,
but based on company list prices it would be worth about $1.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is great news, because it shows the strength that's
coming back in the Asian markets,'' Boeing spokeswoman Marta
Newhart said.
</P>
<P>
   British carrier easyJet also placed firm orders for 17 smaller
737-700s, worth $765 million to $850 million, depending on
interiors selected by the airline. Deliveries are to begin in July
2001.
</P>
<P>
   EasyJet, which previously ordered 15 next-generation 737-700s
and 12 new 737-300s, plans to use the additional planes on its
routes from London to cities in Europe as well as short routes to
cities within the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine 777-300X is an extended-range version of the
777-300, capable of flying 8,300 miles, compared to 6,854 miles for
the earlier model. At a bit more than 242 feet, the 777-300 is the
longest commercial jet built and can be configured to carry up to
359 passengers in three classes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is offering the new jets to compete with Airbus Industrie
in the Asia-Pacific market. Airbus has a long-range version of its
four-engine A-340, and is developing the larger A340-500 and
A340-600 models.

<HEADLINE> Medicare To Cap Outpatient Copays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare announced new rules Friday that will
limit older Americans' out-of-pocket costs for hospital outpatient
services starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The change will cap Medicare copayments for services received in
hospital-owned outpatient care centers -- such as one-day surgery,
radiology and rehabilitation therapy -- at a maximum equivalent to
the program's inpatient hospital deductible. That's $776 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most other services for which a retiree pays a standard
20 percent out-of-pocket share of the bill, with Medicare picking
up 80 percent, copayments for outpatient services vary widely but
average about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, that disparity is scheduled to diminish
gradually, as the government slowly picks up more outpatient costs.
But getting outpatient copays to the standard 20 percent is
projected to take decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Congress and the Clinton administration agreed
last fall to institute a new dollar-amount limit.
</P>
<P>
   The cap will apply separately to each outpatient service. For
example, each visit during a course of radiation therapy would be
treated separately, and a patient could conceivably receive
multiple services, each subject to a separate cap, during a single
trip to an outpatient center.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, the new caps will have limited impact, mainly
reducing beneficiaries' bills for particularly expensive outpatient
services such as one-day surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many retirees buy supplemental private insurance that
covers Medicare copays.

<HEADLINE> Illinois Grad Students Stage Sit-In  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KELLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   URBANA, Ill. (AP) -- Graduate students trying to win recognition
for a union ended a 20-hour sit-in at the University of Illinois
administration building Friday, saying their next step could be a
strike.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 protesters walked out of the building chanting: ''We
keep this campus open, we can shut it down.''
</P>
<P>
   A university spokesman said the demonstrations will not change
the school's anti-union stance.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of graduate students do research, fill administrative
jobs and teach about half of the entry-level classes on campus. In
exchange, they get free tuition and stipends that administrators
say increased at a higher rate than inflation since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Graduate Employees Organization is demanding better working
conditions, pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The group will meet April 10, and ''can't not consider'' a
strike, GEO leader David Kamper said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, 27 campuses had
recognized graduate student unions by December, and organizing
efforts were under way at many other schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois sit-in began Thursday when students, labor
activists and ministers refused to leave the administration offices
until they were granted a meeting with administrators. The request
was denied.
</P>
<P>
   The students left the following morning, saying they had made
their point.
</P>
<P>
   The protest followed two days of demonstrations and rallies on
campus with graduate students teaching classes on the lawn and
grading homework in hallways to show the work they do.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel underpaid for our jobs,'' said graduate employee
Theresa Ferguson. ''I work many more hours than I get paid for, but
I have no rights to give the administration my input about my
working conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   University spokesman Bill Murphy said the school isn't satisfied
with the pay levels but has limited funds to work with.

<HEADLINE> Reputed Pa. Mob Boss Indicted  </HEADLINE>
By RON TODT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Joseph ''Skinny Joey'' Merlino, reputed boss
of the Philadelphia mob, is accused of murder, racketeering and
extortion in an indictment reached with help from his predecessor,
authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-count indictment accused Merlino of killing three men and
trying to kill another. Ten other people named in the indictment
are accused of various charges ranging from murder to conspiracy to
illegal gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Former boss Ralph Natale allegedly ceded control of the
Philadelphia-South Jersey mob to Merlino in 1998. When Natale
agreed to cooperate with authorities last summer, he became the
highest-ranking American Mafia figure to flip sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot overstate the significance of this case. Not only
does it reach to the highest levels of organized crime, significant
evidence comes from the highest levels of organized crime. ... That
has never occurred before,'' U.S. Attorney Michael Stiles said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That in my judgment represents a complete collapse of this
criminal organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Merlino already is jailed on drug charges. Of the others, eight
were arrested Friday, and two were arrested earlier and freed on
bail.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment links Merlino and others with the murders of
William Veasey, Joseph Sodano and Anthony Turra along with the
attempted murder of Joseph Ciancaglini Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Thursday that Gaetano ''Tommy
Horsehead'' Scafidi had agreed to cooperate with authorities and
help them build a case that linked Merlino and others to the 1993
attempted murder of Ciancaglini.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting started a war between the Merlino faction of the
mob and an organization headed by then-mob boss John Stanfa.
Ciancaglini was a Stanfa underboss, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also accuses some of the defendants of operating
a widespread mob protection racket that preyed on bookmakers,
numbers operators, video poker machine operators and others
involved in criminal activity in Philadelphia and southern New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. Conforti, the FBI's special agent in charge in
Philadelphia, said Merlino's organization did business ''the
old-fashioned mob way -- extortion, bookmaking, manufacture and
distribution of heroin, theft and murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, it has not ''proved to be a good line of
work,'' Conforti said, citing 24 mob members who have been
imprisoned and at least 15 who were killed over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Merlino pleaded innocent to federal charges of
racketeering and conspiracy in a $1.3 million theft ring. A
12-count indictment accused him and 13 others of engaging in drug
trafficking and operating a scheme involving products stolen from
city rail yards.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino was acquitted Oct. 21 of charges that he threatened to
kill an organized crime investigator who arrested him in June at
his house in Margate, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Offers Gay Scholarship program  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Gov. Tom Vilsack and the mother of
Matthew Shepard announced the establishment of a college
scholarship program in Shepard's name for openly gay high school
students.
</P>
<P>
   ''These scholarships will add meaning to a life cut short,''
Vilsack said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack appeared at a news conference with Judy Shepard, whose
son, a gay University of Wyoming student, was fatally beaten in
Laramie, Wyo., in 1998. Since her son's death, she has traveled the
country, campaigning against hate crimes involving gays.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must change these attitudes and we must take a stand,''
Shepard said. She said the scholarships would help help win
acceptance of gays.
</P>
<P>
   Three scholarships a year will be given to gay high school
graduates who want to attend one of Iowa's three state
universities. The scholarships will cover tuition, fees and books
at the University of Northern Iowa, Iowa State University or the
University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Funding comes from a charitable foundation by established by Des
Moines businessman Rich Eychaner. An openly gay Republican,
Eychaner made an unsuccessful bid for the House in 1984 but lost in
the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarships will be awarded on the basis of academic
achievement, financial need and community service, Vilsack said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives in the Legislature have attacked Vilsack for
banning state government employment discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Judge Thayer Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire Supreme Court Justice Stephen
Thayer, under pressure from state and federal investigations of his
personal finances, resigned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer hand-delivered his resignation to Gov. Jeanne Shaheen a
month after he was put on leave while authorities investigated him
for failing to disclose a personal loan.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the FBI said its investigation found no evidence of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But Attorney General Philip McLaughlin said Friday an
investigation by his office resulted in Thayer's resignation.
McLaughlin said he would release a full report of the investigation
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer, 54, a former U.S. attorney, was appointed to the New
Hampshire Supreme Court in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, William Brennan, did not immediately return a phone
call Friday. He said this week the intense attention to Thayer's
actions had been costly.
</P>
<P>
   ''This process has taken its toll, not only on him, but also the
institution he has served for the last 16 years,'' Brennan said.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations arose during Thayer's recent divorce that he had
failed to disclose some of his debts on home loan applications.
Federal banking laws require that all debts be disclosed on
mortgage and loan applications.
</P>
<P>
   Independently, the state's Judicial Conduct Committee is
investigating Thayer's failure to report a $50,000 loan from lawyer
Emile Bussiere on annual financial disclosure forms for judges from
1997 to 1999. Thayer later amended the forms to disclose the loan.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also is looking into Thayer's failure to report
the Bussiere loan on a 1997 bank application for a $55,000 home
equity loan, and whether he omitted other debts from a 1993
mortgage application -- the same allegations investigated by the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer's colleagues on the court placed him on administrative
leave with pay last month, but did not say why. Thayer had been
fighting the suspension in federal court.

<HEADLINE> Headless Chicken Sculpture Made  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRUITA, Colo. (AP) -- For 18 months in the 1940s, it seemed as if
Mike the headless chicken might be immortal. Now he's being
immortalized in a metal sculpture in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-foot sculpture of the beheaded rooster was to be stuck in a
planter on a downtown corner Friday in this town of 6,000. Artist
Lyle Nichols, who grew up in Fruita, made the 300-pound replica
using ax heads and hay-rake teeth, along with sickle blades and
other cutting objects.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made him proud-looking and cocky,'' Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   The rooster belonged to Fruita farmer Lloyd Olsen, who planned
to put Mike into the cooking pot and lopped off his head at the
base of the skull to leave as much of the tasty neck as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike just fluffed up his feathers -- although he could only
go through the motions of pecking for food, and when he tried to
crow, a gurgle came out.
</P>
<P>
   But he was still alive the next morning. Olsen started putting
feed and water directly into Mike's gullet with an eyedropper.
</P>
<P>
   When Mike was still alive a week later, Olsen took him to
University of Utah scientists, who theorized Mike had enough of a
brain stem left to live headless. He made it into Life magazine and
the Guinness Book of World Records and was a popular attraction
until he choked to death on a corn kernel in an Arizona motel.
</P>
<P>
   Chamber of Commerce officials dug up his story last spring when
they were looking for something besides pioneers to focus on for
Colorado Heritage Week. That led to the first Mike the Headless
Chicken Festival.
</P>
<P>
   This year's is scheduled for May 19 and 20, and in addition to
food (chicken) and music, it is scheduled to feature -- naturally --
''the run like a chicken with your head cut off 5K.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Fed. Agency Books Better  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More federal agencies are keeping their books
in order, but serious problems remain in tracking transactions
worth billions of dollars, according to a report made public
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department's annual look at the financial
statements of 24 federal agencies for the fiscal year that ended
Sept. 30 found that 13 received clean ratings by auditors, up from
six when the survey was first conducted in 1996 and 12 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Four agency statements got qualified, or acceptable, opinions
and five -- down from 13 in 1996 -- came back with disclaimers, which
means they were unsatisfactory. Two agencies, the departments of
Interior and State, did not meet filing deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Significant progress continues to be made in the areas of
financial management,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers wrote
in the report, prepared with the White House's Office of Management
and Budget and the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative arm.
</P>
<P>
   ''More agencies are completing their financial statements on
time, and the quality of the data continues to improve,'' Summers
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., who discussed the report at a
hearing of his House Government Reform Committee panel, said
agencies as a whole still earned no better than a ''D+'' in
providing reliable, accurate financial information.
</P>
<P>
   Horn acknowledged some progress but said he was ''disheartened,
but not surprised,'' that significant accounting discrepancies and
financial weaknesses remain. Horn graded all 24 agencies, giving A
grades only to NASA and the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Horn cited as examples of poor bookkeeping an overpayment of
Medicare claims by $13.5 billion last year, down from $23 billion
in 1996, and the IRS' issuance of a $15,000 tax refund to a person
with an overdue tax bill of near $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Horn also asked why trustees of the Medicare and Social Security
trust funds came out with a report on Thursday, just a day before
Treasury's report, that gave a far rosier outlook of the financial
solvency of the two programs.
</P>
<P>
   General Accounting Office Comptroller General David Walker
agreed that the lack of coordination in the two reports ''makes the
government look foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker praised the Social Security Administration for making
good progress in financial management, while singling out the
Pentagon, which holds a large percentage of government assets, for
being unable to consistently produce auditable financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO also found high risk financial management at the IRS,
the Forest Service and the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The government was ''unable to support significant portions of
the $1.76 trillion reported as the total net cost of government
operations,'' the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   It said $313 billion reported as a liability for remediation of
environmental contamination and disposal of hazardous waste may not
be complete, and data were not available for an accurate estimate
of a reported $196 billion military retirement health benefits
liability.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Gotbaum of the Office of Management and Budget said this
still marked a major improvement from 10 years ago, when almost no
agencies prepared audited financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that last October the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants recognized federal accounting standards as
''generally accepted accounting principles,'' a ''significant
milestone in improving public confidence'' in federal financial
management.

<HEADLINE> Widespread Rail Track Defects Found  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- CSX Transportation announced an internal
review of its track maintenance Friday after federal railroad
inspectors found deteriorating conditions in its system used by
passenger, freight and commuter trains up and down the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Railroad Administration had begun a special safety
audit of the railroad in February after a series of derailments.
</P>
<P>
   George Gavalla, associate administrator for safety, said the
agency audited CSX in 1997 and became concerned because it hadn't
seen a reduction in derailments and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Snow, chairman and chief executive officer of CSX
Corporation, responded that his company ''has repaired or is in the
process of repairing all of the defects identified in the report.
Where work is in progress, operations have been modified to ensure
safe movement of trains.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said Snow will personally head an internal company
review of all track maintenance and improvement programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main concern,'' Gavalla said in a telephone interview,
''was the lack of quality control in CSX track inspection
maintenance programs.'' He said the railroad has promised to
initiate safety programs that go beyond federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Problems were found in track conditions used by Amtrak and
commuter rail lines and in one case insufficient repairs were made
following a derailment, Gavalla said.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found a 60 percent increase in track-caused accidents
over five years on the 22,700-mile system, according to a report in
The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The review found many instances in which the distance between
the rails had spread wide enough to risk derailments.
</P>
<P>
   Two such wide areas were found in the District of Columbia on
the line used by Amtrak, Virginia Railway Express and all
north-south CSX freight trains. The defects were repaired
immediately after they were found.
</P>
<P>
   Defects were also found in Florida, Pennsylvania and Maryland
</P>
<P>
   Two of three recent track-caused derailments were caused by wide
track, including a minor derailment of Amtrak's Chicago-Washington
Capitol Limited at Connellsville, Pa., on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Federal safety standards dictate conditions for railroad track
including the gauge, or distance between tracks. Railroads are
supposed to inspect their tracks twice a week and, when a problem
is found, either make immediate repairs or slow traffic over the
area until it can be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   The special safety audit is not a rare event, Gavalla said. ''We
always have inspectors on every railroad virtually every day.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 83.37; Dow Up 95.55  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly higher today as investors
shook off their distress over plummeting technology shares and
began looking for bargains after a weeklong selloff.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading, the Nasdaq composite index was up 83.37 at
4,541.26 after dropping 187 points on Thursday. The index had been
lower for most of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Dow Jones industrial average was up 95.55 at
11,075.80, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 19.15 at
1,507.07.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq began moving higher on the strength of stalwarts like
Dell Computer, up 2} at 54 15/16, and Intel, up 6 5/16 at 133 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree Holdings rose 8{ to 69{ after a Lehman Brothers
analyst issued a ''buy'' rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Some steep losses by technology stocks hemmed in the Nasdaq's
recovery. Shares of drkoop.com, the online health information
provider, fell 42 percent, or by 2|, to 3| after auditors
questioned the viability of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet company hit hard was Ariba, which helps
companies track sales on the Web. The stock was down 14 at 206
after a Prudential Securities analyst downgraded the stock to
''accumulate'' from ''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel and Hewlett-Packard, up 5\ to 136, paced the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco fell about 19 percent after the insurance and financial
services company said it will record a $350 million charge and may
sell its consumer finance unit. Shares were down 2| at 11 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   The market was somewhat rattled by a pair of economic reports
released this morning that provided a mixed picture of the
economy's strength.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported that personal income rose 0.4
percent in February but that Americans' spending rose more than
twice as fast. That pulled the nation's savings rate down to an
all-time monthly low, and fueled expectations that the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates at least once more this year in
its bid to slow the economy to sustainable levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no signs of any significant slowdown for consumer
spending,'' said Stan Shipley, senior economist at Merrill Lynch.
''The economy is clearly growing too fast for the Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some market watchers drew encouragement from a second report
that showed orders to U.S. factories were down for the second
straight month in February. Orders for airplanes and other
transportation equipment took their biggest plunge in 10 months,
dropping 8.9 percent. Industrial machinery orders fell 4.8 percent,
the steepest decline since October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 704.52 million
shares, down from 778.66 million shares at the same time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small company stocks was up 7.52 at
539.09.

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A man killed his 1{-year-old son by
slamming him to the pavement Friday, then swung the limp body at
officers as they tried to arrest him, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Hulum, 25, was taken to the state hospital for a

parking lot, police spokesman Terry Hastings said.
</P>
<P>
   With the body slung over his shoulder, he then walked out of the
apartment complex and was confronted by three police officers.
Hulum swung the child's body at the officers, hitting one in the
head with it, before being wrestled to the ground, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Hulum left his 4-year-old daughter behind in the apartment.

<HEADLINE> Russians Attack Chechen Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUDERMES, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops fanned out across
Chechnya's rugged southern mountains on Friday in a bid to save 39
comrades missing since their convoy was ambushed by Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian forces also unleashed air and artillery attacks on
areas where rebel bands are concentrated. Elsewhere, the United
Nations' top human-rights official arrived in Russia on a trip to
assess allegations of rights violations as international criticism
of the war continues.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine Interior Ministry troops were in the convoy that was
ambushed Wednesday near Vedeno, deep in the mountains, said Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin spokesman for Chechnya. Four soldiers
were killed in the attack, he said, according to the Interfax news
agency. Six managed to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Federal troops spread out around Vedeno to search for the 39
missing fighters, the military command said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo, who flew to the
Vedeno region Friday, outlined the problems Russian troops were
having with the search: ''The difficult land formations, the
difficult weather conditions, and besides, the danger of the land
being mined.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There probably will be more dead, and more missing in
action,'' he told NTV television.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of Russia's General
Staff, said Friday that Russian forces had all of Chechnya under
''practical control,'' and the federal troops are better equipped
and numerically superior to the Chechen fighters. Nonetheless, the
ambush was the latest in a series of attacks demonstrating Russian
forces' vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Russian ground forces that entered Chechnya in late September
have driven most rebels into the mountains that make up the
republic's southern third. The rebels are skilled guerrilla
fighters who use the rough terrain to their advantage, while
Russian forces struggle to move their heavy equipment in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials repeatedly have said the rebels are on the
verge of defeat, but the fighters continue to resist fiercely, and
many rebels are believed to have filtered back into Russian-held
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have repeatedly charged that Russian forces
are committing widespread violations in the breakaway republic,
including torturing detainees and summarily executing civilians.
Russia has rejected the allegations. But in an apparent bow to
international pressure, the Kremlin invited the U.N. High
Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, to visit Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am aware that there has been violence on both sides. There
has also been Chechen violence and the background is quite a
complex one,'' she said after arriving Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's Chechnya tour is to include a visit to detention
facilities. Some groups charge that, in the past, Russia has moved
tortured detainees out of such facilities before allowing access by
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung reported in
Saturday's edition that the body of Gen. Gennady Shpigun, who was
kidnapped a year ago in Chechnya, has been found. Shpigun, the
Interior Ministry's envoy to Chechnya, escaped from custody in
February and froze to death while fleeing, the newspaper cited
Chechen and Russian sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Russian spokesmen could not be reached for comment. Rushailo
said on March 20 that Shpigun was still alive.

<HEADLINE> Conseco To Sell Consumer Lender  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARMEL, Ind. (AP) -- Conseco Inc. is looking for a buyer for a
consumer lending operation it paid $6 billion for just two years
ago. Its stock price sank.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco said Friday it has hired Lehman Brothers Inc. to assist
with the sale of Conseco Finance Corp., which has $46 billion in
receivables.
</P>
<P>
   The Carmel-based financial service company also said it will
write down by approximately $350 million the value of its
interest-only securities in the subsidiary. The writedown will show
up as a non-cash charge against previously disclosed 1999 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The unit was known as Green Tree Financial Corp. when Conseco
acquired it 1998. The company, then based in St. Paul, Minn., made
loans primarily to buyers of manufactured homes.
</P>
<P>
   The deal never produced the higher share prices Conseco
executives had expected, chairman and chief executive Stephen C.
Hilbert acknowledged in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   The deal had the opposite effect on Conseco's stock. Investors
reacted negatively, in part because of questions surrounding Green
Tree's accounting practices, the reliability of its financial
results and the fit of the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading, Conseco stock was down $2.06\, or 15
percent, to $11.62{ on the New York Stock Exchange, a fraction of
its 52-week high of $35.31\.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the deal, Hilbert saw the combination of the two
companies as the key to Conseco's transformation from an insurance
company to a diversified financial services company.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he said Conseco will try to refocus its efforts on
core insurance and investment operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the time is right for Conseco to expand its role as
the leading 'pure play' company in the insurance and investment
industry focused on middle American consumers,'' Hilbert said.

<HEADLINE> H&AMP;M Opens First U.S. Store  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL BECK, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hennes &AMP; Mauritz opened its first U.S. store on
Friday, attracting thousands of shoppers who were eager to grab up
the cheap-yet-chic clothes from the popular Swedish chain.
</P>
<P>
   From curious New Yorkers to European tourists, they piled into
H&AMP;M's store on tony Fifth Avenue, combing through the racks filled
with fashionable $9 shirts and $20 pairs of pants.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiastic crowd offered a temporary distraction from
troubles that beset H&AMP;M last week, when its chief executive quit
and the company reported a 12 percent drop in projected quarterly
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Stockholm-based H&AMP;M has built a strong reputation for offering
trendy fashions at affordable prices. Founded in 1947, it now has
more than 600 stores throughout Europe and is planning on an
aggressive expansion into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Its first stop here is in the New York area. Five stores are
slated to open during this year, all in popular malls and shopping
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   That will surely cause concern among its rivals, such as the Gap
and Limited, which will be forced to compete with H&AMP;M's low prices
and constantly changing merchandise assortment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The arrival of H&AMP;M could be a devastating blow to their
competitors,'' said Kurt Barnard, a retail consultant and president
of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. ''They
will put pricing pressure and fashion pressure on everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers were eager to see what this new chain -- which is often
called the Ikea of the clothing business -- was all about on Friday
as the doors swung open at the New York store.
</P>
<P>
   Some went straight for the $35 flared-bottom jeans and $9 fake
pony-hair bags, while others stuck to the men's nylon jackets for
$25.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are right in style with everything, and I like that about
them,'' said Lydia Waldmann of Briarcliff, N.Y., who had shopped at
H&AMP;M before in Germany and anxiously awaited their U.S. debut.
''Best of all is that I can afford everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge crowds on its first day in the United States,
there remains some concern about the future of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the company missed analysts' estimates with its drop
in preliminary quarterly profits. The retailer blamed the earnings
shortfall on expansion costs in the United States and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   It also announced the surprise resignation of its chief
executive officer Fabian Mansson, who was leaving to join a Swedish
Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   That sent its stock tumbling more than 30 percent in overseas
trading on March 23, and it remained under pressure this week.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is concern that the stock selloff and the shakeup in
the executive suite will stall its ambitious U.S. expansion plans.

<HEADLINE> Houston To Develop Deaf Policies  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To settle a federal investigation, the city of
Houston agreed Friday to provide sign language interpreters or
other aids for the deaf and to retrain city workers in its police
department, municipal courts and jail.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement ends an investigation by the Justice Department's
civil rights division for possible violations of the Americans with
Disabilities Act. It also will be submitted for court approval as
part of the city's settlement of two private lawsuits brought by
deaf men. The city denied the allegations in both complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city of Houston should be commended for working with us to
develop a set of policies that will serve as a model for other
cities,'' acting Assistant Attorney General Bill Lann Lee said.
''It is vitally important that people who are deaf or hard of
hearing are treated fairly by the criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice investigation began after a deaf man complained that
he did not know why he was arrested by Houston police or where he
was being taken because he could not communicate with them. He also
alleged that he was not able to communicate with any jail
officials. He filed one of the private suits against the city in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   During its investigation, the Justice Department learned that a
second deaf man had filed another lawsuit with similar complaints.
The second man also complained he could not communicate with
Houston police officers who arrested him. And he alleged that he
was denied important medical treatment because the City Jail health
staff did not call in a sign language interpreter and that he was
not provided a sign language interpreter in municipal courts.
</P>
<P>
   All three agencies agreed to name a disability law coordinator,
to purchase telecommunication devices for the deaf and to train
city staff in how to operate them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the police department will issue a new general
order on how to interact with witnesses, victims and suspects who
are hard of hearing. The police will require that a sign language
interpreter be called any time a person who needs one is in a major
accident, suspected of a felony, arrested, given an alcohol test or
gives a statement. Every sergeant and higher ranking officer will
be trained in the new procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The jail will inform those under arrest that they have a right
to hearing aids and services at every step of the justice system
and will keep a list of qualified interpreters available within one
hour. It will also ensure that jail medical staff can communicate
with the hard of hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The municipal courts will guarantee appropriate aides and
services for parties, witnesses, jurors and spectators at all court
proceedings. This new policy will be printed on all notices of
court dates, tickets and summonses. Every judge and court
administrator will be trained.
</P>
<P>
   The disability law requires that state and local governments
ensure the deaf and hard of hearing can communicate with city
workers as effectively as others. Interpreters, assistive listening
devices and written materials must be provided unless it would
result in an undue burden.

<HEADLINE> Northern Japan Volcano Erupts  </HEADLINE>
By KOJI SASAHARA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- A volcano in northern Japan erupted Friday
for the first time in 22 years, sending a spectacular blue-gray
plume of molten rock and ash billowing two miles above the crater
and rolling down the snow-quilted slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Ash dusted silent, evacuated villages near Mount Usu. The only
other noise came from sirens screaming warnings and ambulances and
police cars cruising in search of damage.
</P>
<P>
   Farther away from the volcano people streamed into the streets
and climbed to rooftops to watch the towering cloud that blossomed
from the eruption. Some snapped photographs of debris that rose two
miles high for over two hours.
</P>
<P>
   But those in the nearby city of Date who weren't looking out a
window would barely have known that 2,416-foot Mount Usu was
erupting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't feel anything, I didn't hear anything,'' said
Norimichi Nagao, who works for the nearby city on Japan's
northernmost main island of Hokkaido. ''I didn't even know that
there was an eruption until I saw it on television.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. But more
than 11,000 people evacuated from communities at Usu's base after
the earth began rumbling earlier this week faced another night in
rescue centers as officials warned that it too early to say danger
had been averted.
</P>
<P>
   Snow fell Friday evening, increasing concerns about mudslides in
the lakeside resort area. The military was called in because of
concerns over the possibility of landslides or mudslides caused by
melting runoff. Two people were killed and 200 homes destroyed in
mudslides following Usu's last eruptions, which began in 1977 and
continued into the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Fears also remained that Usu could spew a deadly mix of gas and
rocks -- called a pyroclastic flow -- that races down slopes and
incinerates everything in its path.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said that evacuees might have to
stay for a while at makeshift centers set up in school gyms and
community halls. The government will consider building temporary
housing if that is the case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the centers, families sat on blankets spread out to mark
their private space. Some put up cardboard partitions, but there
was little else to give them any sense of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   About 51,000 people live in the coastal city of Date --
pronounced Dah-tay -- and several smaller towns near Usu, located
475 miles north of Tokyo. Experts had predicted the eruption
because of increased seismic activity that began earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   In Date, the eruption under clear blue skies became more of a
public spectacle than a threat. The somewhat relaxed atmosphere was
understandable: After days of small but constant earthquakes and
high-level warnings, many residents were ready.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the eruption, volcanic ash began to
rain down on nearby towns. Residents downwind were soon enveloped
by the pungent smell of sulfur.
</P>
<P>
   While Date was spared ashfall by winds that blew debris from the
eruption in the opposite direction, other places were not so lucky.
Cars coming in from other areas around the mountain were covered in
dust. Two other towns near Mount Usu, Abuta and Sobetsu, were
silent and empty, nearly all their residents evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Some area residents expressed a mixture of relief and anxiety
after the long-awaited eruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy I'm safe, but I'm afraid this will do huge damage to
my business,'' said 53-year-old scallop cultivator Yomiko Yasuko,
who was out at sea when the volcano erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most eruption-prone countries, with
86 active volcanoes.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Hate Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A man who randomly assaulted a woman on the
street was sentenced to six years in prison in the first case of
its kind to be prosecuted as a hate crime in California.
</P>
<P>
   A jury found that Billy McCall's hatred of women motivated the
Aug. 1 attack. That added two years to McCall's sentence, which was
handed down Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The case was the first time the state's hate crime law has been
used to prosecute an offense motivated by the victim's gender. Hate
crime laws usually are applied in cases involving crimes motivated
by race, ethnicity or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The victim had been tackled from behind and hit her head on the
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, 29, was convicted March 2.
</P>
<P>
   McCall's attorney, Karolyn Kovtun, said an appeal has been filed
challenging the use of the hate crime law.
</P>
<P>
   Karen McLaughlin, director of the National Center for Hate Crime
Prevention in Boston, said McCall's conviction was one of the first
of its kind in the nation.

<HEADLINE> Rick and Darva: Together Again?  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The problem with TV isn't so much its tacky
programs and even tackier personalities. No, the big problem comes
when TV lies.
</P>
<P>
   I have come to understand this from Rick Rockwell and Darva
Conger and their marriage on the rocks, all arising from the
by-now-notorious Fox network special ''Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Note: Bad taste made ''Multimillionaire'' a triumph. But what
did it in was bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   Here's former Air Force nurse Conger, who admits she took part
in the ''Multimillionaire'' matchup as a lark, then fibbed her way
through her marriage vows. ''I was playing a role,'' she told Larry
King, just one stop on her publicity tour to tell the world she
wants her privacy back.
</P>
<P>
   Surely Conger knows that showing her pretty face on CNN's
''Larry King Live,'' ABC's ''Good Morning America'' and ''Dateline
NBC'' isn't the best way to restore her anonymity. And that
responding to questions about posing for Playboy, particularly in
the affirmative (''I couldn't say 'definitely not' to anything
right now,'' she declared on NBC's ''Today''), isn't the best way
to repair her good name.
</P>
<P>
   And here's Rockwell, a smalltime actor/comic born Richard Balkey
whose very status as a multimillionaire was being questioned only
days after the broadcast. Even as he insists he's a dreamy-eyed
romantic who was hoping for a soul mate, he is milking his
''Multimillionaire'' stunt for maximum reward.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Rockwell was on CNN's ''TalkBack Live,'' part of
his campaign to reignite his show-biz career. ''It's going very
well, it's going really well,'' he said of the standup gigs his
newfound fame has won him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the groom who never so much as glimpsed his bride's
backside quipped that he hopes Conger does pose for Playboy: ''I
want to see her.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the sort of characters who make you long for Joe
Isuzu. (Come to think of it, an Isuzu Trooper was one of Darva's
''wedding presents.'') Or Jon Lovitz's truth-defying alter ego who
would gloat, ''Yeah, that's the ticket,'' with each self-promoting
falsehood. Unlike their flesh-and-blood counterparts, make-believe
liars are funny. Not toxic.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of ''Multimillionaire's'' duplicity was on camera.
Consider the bad faith exhibited behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the producers chose to represent their ''Mr.
Multimillionaire'' chiefly as a real estate magnate with a golf
course and a plane, not as the goofball who starred in ''Return of
the Killer Tomatoes'' and can tell jokes for 30 hours straight. In
short, not as a guy who might do anything, like take a wife, to
land himself some TV face-time.
</P>
<P>
   Even more deceitfully, the program, which placed Rick and Darva
in holy matrimony, left viewers with the feeling that this was a
viable marriage, however ill-advised or short-lived it might prove
to be.
</P>
<P>
   But remember that the show was prerecorded. Its taping date was
Feb. 8. By the time ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?''
aired on Feb. 15, the marriage was clearly a nonstarter. Still on
their honeymoon cruise, Rick and Darva were barely even sharing
hellos, as the show's production company, which had sent along two
escorts, surely knew.
</P>
<P>
   As for viewers, kept in the dark that the marriage they were
witnessing was already moot -- well, they were conned. All 22.8
million of them.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   But then came to light a pesky 1991 restraining order issued
against Rockwell after an ex-girlfriend accused him of hitting and
threatening to kill her. (These were charges Rockwell denied,
although he owned up to having let the air out of her tires.)
</P>
<P>
   Then Fox network boss Sandy Grushow grandly pronounced the end
of all such ''exploitative reality specials,'' in his words.
''They're gone; they're over.'' Which was for the best. They might
have pre-empted the ongoing Fox series ''World's Wildest Police
Videos'' and ''Cops.''
</P>
<P>
   But will anything pre-empt Rick and Darva?
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet against seeing Rick Rockwell as the host of some
third-tier cable talk show.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Darva Conger? Well, it doesn't take a nurse to tell
she's bitten by the TV bug. Despite past talk of escaping the
limelight, she virtually canvasses for a high-profile job in an
interview in this week's TV Guide -- a job that would combine
''health education, public speaking and the media.'' (Look out, Dr.
Bob Arnot!)
</P>
<P>
   Alone, each could make it. But a far greater draw would be this
twin bill: Rick and Darva, the couple that never was, reunited for
money and glory on TV. Maybe on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The sad truth is, if you think it couldn't happen, you're lying
to yourself.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Journalist Convicted  </HEADLINE>
By CASIMIRO SIONA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- An Angolan court on Friday sentenced a
prominent journalist to six months in jail after a trial during
which defense witnesses were barred from speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Marques, 28, was convicted of defaming the country's
president in a newspaper article. In addition to the jail time, he
was ordered to pay $1,000 in fines and court costs. However, the
sentence was suspended while Marques awaits the outcome of an
appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stemmed from an article late last year in which
Marques said President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos should be held
accountable for the country's near-collapse amid government
corruption fostered by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The article appeared in the Luanda-based weekly Agora, and the
court sentenced its editor, Aguiar dos Santos, to two months in
prison for publishing it. That sentence also was suspended pending
an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The case has prompted fierce criticism at home and abroad. The
U.S. State Department expressed concern at the way the trial was
conducted and the government's heavy-handed reaction to criticism
in the media.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke urged the
government to rescind or dramatically reduce the sentence so that
Marques spends no more time in jail. Marques was jailed for more
than a month before being charged and released in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not trying to interfere in an internal event in Angola,
but I think this jail sentence is extraordinarily harsh,''
Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Marques' trial began March 21 in Luanda and initially was to be
open to the public. But Judge Joaquim Cangato ordered it closed
before the first session, saying a photographer had breached rules
by taking pictures of the empty courtroom before the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The judge barred the defense's witnesses from speaking and
refused to accept evidence the defense said proved the allegations
Marques made in his article. The judge also banned Marques's
attorney, Luis Nascimento, from the case and from practicing law
for six months after he walked out of the courtroom in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The new defense lawyer -- Antonio Joao Francisco, who was named
by Cangato -- reportedly had no legal experience.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries and human rights groups have condemned the
Angolan government for harassing and jailing dozens of independent
journalists since the country's two-decade civil war resumed in
December 1998. The government and UNITA rebels began fighting after
the southwest African country gained independence from Portugal in
1975.

<HEADLINE> Board Considering Rail Merger Rules  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government regulators will consider setting
performance standards and may even seek ways to increase
competition when evaluating future railroad mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The Surface Transportation Board disclosed Friday this and other
measures under consideration as it revamps its merger rules.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the board ordered a halt to merger talks among
major rail carriers, citing service problems that have occurred
following a pair of recent combinations. The board blocked all
merger activity while it reconsiders the rules under which it will
review such deals.
</P>
<P>
   That step disappointed two companies that had been discussing a
possible marriage, Canadian National and Burlington Northern Santa
Fe.
</P>
<P>
   But the board said it is concerned that a continuation of such
deals could result in a transcontinental rail ''duopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, board chairman Linda J. Morgan set June 11, 2001, as
the date to issue those new rules and listed the matters being
considered.
</P>
<P>
   She said the agency plans to drop its current ''one case at a
time'' policy so it can consider the downstream effects of any
future deals, including likely responses by other railroad
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Current rules also include maintaining competition in the areas
of merging roads. The board said it will also consider whether to
go beyond that and seek increased competition in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   Finding ways to protect customers and shortline railroads that
connect to major carriers from merger-related service disruptions
will also be a major topic, the board said. This might include
setting performance standards and requiring compensation for
service failures.
</P>
<P>
   The board said it also plans to address in its new merger rules:
</P>
<P>
   --Ways to ensure adequate and coordinated consideration of safety
issues.
</P>
<P>
   --Protection for railroad workers when contracts are merged
between roads.
</P>
<P>
   --Safety regulation and defense issues that could result from the
combination of major U.S. and Canadian railroads.

   Burlington Northern and Canadian National had asked the board to
let their $6 billion merger move forward while the government
developed new rules. But the board rejected that plea, contending
it did not want to be creating new merger regulations in the middle

   Prognosis Is Dim for DrKoop.com
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of the Internet health company DrKoop.com
Inc. plunged more than 40 percent today after the company's
accountant said the Internet firm may not survive. In the company's
annual report filed late Thursday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC said Drkoop.com has
sustained losses and negative cash flows from operations since its
inception. And the auditor expressed ''substantial doubt'' about
the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Such warnings
are extremely rare in the world of public companies, and auditors
only use such terms if they believe the company has a good chance
of going out of business within the year. Koop stock was down 2} at

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- CSX Transportation announced an internal

inspectors found deteriorating conditions in its system used by

The Federal Railroad Administration had begun a special safety
audit of the railroad in February after a series of derailments.
George Gavalla, associate administrator for safety, said the agency
audited CSX in 1997 and became concerned because it hadn't seen a
reduction in derailments and other problems. John W. Snow, chairman
and chief executive officer of CSX Corporation, responded that his
company ''has repaired or is in the process of repairing all of the
defects identified in the report. The company said Snow will
personally head an internal company review of all track maintenance
and improvement programs.

   Boeing Inspects 767 Part for Cracks
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. has notified all its 767-300

tank may be susceptible to cracking. Boeing is inspecting 16 model
767-300 jets in various stages of production for cracks in
''stringers,'' which run the width of the fuel tank and help
support the wing. No cracks have been reported in planes currently
in service with carriers, Boeing spokeswoman Debbie Heathers said
today. Boeing said the problem came to light recently when an
8-inch crack was found in a stringer on a 767-300 in production at

<HEADLINE> De Beers Certifies Diamond Sources  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- De Beers, the South African conglomerate that
dominates the world diamond trade, has begun selling stones with a
guarantee that they don't come from rebels in Angola or other
African countries.
</P>
<P>
   The certification process began this week, but an unrelated
legal dispute means De Beers isn't selling diamonds from any source
in Angola for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the United Nations to cut off the financial
resources of Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, De Beers announced
in October that it would be certifying that any diamonds it sold
came from legitimate sources.
</P>
<P>
   The only Angolan diamonds it will sell will be through a
contract signed in 1990 with SDM, a joint venture of Ashton Mining
of Canada, Odebrecht of Brazil and Endiama, Angola's state diamond
company.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have curtailed all of our outside buying on the outside
market, and all the diamonds that come to us come from our own
mines, our partners in Botswana and Namibia, and those we buy and
contract from Russia and Canada,'' Andrew Lamont, spokesman for
Diamond Trading Co. Ltd., De Beers' London marketing arm, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Angolan government issued a decree on Jan. 31, however, that
all diamond transactions have to go through Ascorp, a new venture
in which former diamond dealer and businessman Lev Leviev has a
stake, according to The Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   Leviev, chairman of Africa-Israel Investments Ltd., was quoted
as saying that his new marketing system would prevent ''dirty
diamonds'' from rebels getting to market.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really improves greatly the security of the diamond
deliveries and helps the social and economic environment in
Angola,'' Leviev was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   But De Beers chairman Gary Ralfe, speaking at a diamond
conference in Israel on March 24, said his company has ''a lawful
contract operating with SDM which is underpinned by a very large
loan and will defend our contractual right in any jurisdiction
where the remedies of law are available.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, police in Belgium seized a consignment of rough
diamonds bound for Ascorp after De Beers contended it had a valid
contract for them.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Confident of Taiwan's Defense  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen expressed
confidence Friday that Taiwan has the military strength to defend
itself against China, despite China's vast numerical superiority.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was asked about a Washington Post article Friday quoting a
secret report as saying the Pentagon believes Taiwan's military is
technologically outdated and has a ''host of problems'' that make
it vulnerable to potential Chinese invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary said because of the report's security
classification, he could not discuss it directly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not in a position to comment publicly,'' he said, ''other
than to say that as I read the report that was in the newspaper it
appears that Taiwan is still very capable in terms of military
capability, but that there are recommendations -- there are always
recommendations -- for ways to improve its capability through
training and exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post reported that the highly classified Pentagon report
concluded Taiwan, militarily weakened through years of diplomatic
isolation, could have trouble defending against air and missile
attack from China.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was asked whether the Pentagon has changed its view that
China lacks the military power to invade, conquer and hold Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to comment in terms of what the relationship
is,'' Cohen said. ''I'm satisfied that Taiwan is still very
capable.''
</P>
<P>
   The 40-page internal Pentagon report, as described to the Post,
said Taiwan is more vulnerable to attack than is generally
recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's armed forces number about 400,000, compared to China's
2.5-million-strong People's Liberation Army. Taiwan maintains a
qualitative edge, however, due to arms purchases from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the Pentagon periodically assesses Taiwan's military
capabilities and recommends how to improve it. Other officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the quoted report was
designed to suggest ways of addressing weaknesses in Taiwan's
current military structure other than through new arms sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report says the Taiwanese military has failed to
train senior personnel to properly operate weapons systems. This
would appear to reflect the Pentagon's view, expressed in a public
report to Congress last year, that Taiwan's military was having
trouble recruiting technically oriented people.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's military has missed the information revolution, the
latest report suggests, failing to integrate advances in
information processing into its operations. Among other things,
these advances allow for militaries to detect fast-moving and
hidden targets, transfer the information and guide weapons to their
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The report could become important in the debate over whether the
United States should sell Taiwan four modern Aegis guided-missile
destroyers and other advanced military equipment. That includes
long-range radar that could peer deep into the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
   China opposes a sale. It has said such action would be a hostile
''last straw'' in U.S.-Chinese relations. The Clinton
administration is expected to decide what to do by the end of
April.
</P>
<P>
   The report sheds further doubt on whether the equipment would be
too complicated for Taiwan to use properly.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing still claims Taiwan as part of its territory, even
though they have been governed separately since splitting 51 years
ago.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Motor Workers Strike  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Thousands of workers at South Korea's
Daewoo Motor Co. went on strike Friday to protest the possible sale
of their troubled company to a foreign automaker, worried that
their new owner would undertake huge layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Five carmakers, including General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co., are bidding for Daewoo, South Korea's second-largest carmaker.
Fiat SpA of Italy and Hyundai Motor -- Korea's largest car
manufacturer -- also have shown interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We oppose a selloff to foreigners!'' chanted 3,000 Daewoo
Motor workers during a rally in a railway plaza in Pupyong, west of
Seoul. The striking workers would rather have the government take
over the troubled Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, they rallied at the factory and marched two miles to
the plaza, carrying picket signs and banners. No violence was
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo produced 758,500 vehicles in 1999 at its 17 facilities at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Pupyong factory, which usually produces half of
all Daewoo cars sold in South Korea, was closed. Another major
Daewoo factory was running normally. A smaller bus assembly line on
the south coast stopped for two hours as workers held a protest.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo Motor workers said they will stay off the assembly lines
Saturday and Sunday and decide whether to continue the strike
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Management said it has enough inventory to make up for the
two-day work stoppage. But it feared that if the strike were
prolonged, it would hurt Daewoo's exports and hundreds of
subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
   The government and creditor banks are determined to sell the
ailing carmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyundai conglomerate said today it would not assist its
car-making arm in its bid to purchase Daewoo Motor.
</P>
<P>
   The Daewoo conglomerate narrowly escaped bankruptcy when its
domestic creditors agreed in June to delay repayment of $8.3
billion in debt for six months and extend $3.3 billion in new
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo agreed to sell or spin off 13 units. Its 12 other units,
including Daewoo Motor, were placed in a program that calls for
creditors to turn debts into equity or delay debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of June 1999, Daewoo Motor had $18.3 billion in total
assets and $13.9 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   By taking over Daewoo, American automakers hope to strengthen
their presence in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Delay Confirmed in Haitian Elections  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Haitian officials admitted Friday
that scheduled April 9 parliamentary elections are being shelved,
dealing another blow to hopes for democracy in the hemisphere's
poorest country.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians claim President Rene Preval wants to
postpone the vote until December, when former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide runs for another term, so parliamentary
candidates can ride his coattails to victory and strengthen his
power.
</P>
<P>
   Preval -- the hand-picked successor of Aristide, who is barred
from consecutive terms -- shut down parliament last year after a
power struggle, then appointed an electoral council by decree.
</P>
<P>
   Election dates to form a new parliament were twice postponed,
and Preval refused to approve the latest dates -- April 9 and May
21.
</P>
<P>
   April 9 is ''out of the question,'' since it is unacceptable to
Preval, election council member Carlo Dupiton said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, with a mountain of logistical difficulties and
periodic violence shaking Port-au-Prince, the chances of meeting a
June 12 constitutional deadline to install a new parliament are
dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't speak of June 12,'' said Preval's appointed premier,
Jacques-Eduoard Alexis, who insisted this week that Haiti would
hold two separate votes for parliament and president, regardless of
the date.
</P>
<P>
   The United States -- which intervened in Haiti in 1994 to disband
a military-run regime and restore Aristide's elected government --
is pressing Haiti to meet the election deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's indispensable,'' Arturo Valenzuela, President Clinton's
special assistant for Inter-American affairs, said during a March
20 visit.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis bristled at such statements. ''We are not here to defend
the interests of foreign countries before those of our people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With the election process in crisis, Aristide activists
demanding the election council's resignation took to
Port-au-Prince's streets on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, stoning
cars and burning market stalls.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a local opposition party official and his wife were
killed in their home in the western town of Petit-Goave. And on
Thursday, a mob ransacked a Petit-Goave courthouse to protest the
questioning of Aristide partisans in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Also at stake are some $500 million in international loans for
Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation. The loans depend on
ratification by a parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The European Community, meanwhile, has indicated that if a rapid
solution is not found, its aid -- tens of millions of dollars a year
-- would be reconsidered.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka, Tamil Battle To Continue  </HEADLINE>
By ASIF ANSAR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- President Chandrika Kumaratunga said
Friday the military offensive against Tamil rebels will continue
until the guerrillas agreed to lay down their arms, state-run
television Rupavahini reported.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga's statement came as the rebels and government
soldiers battled near a strategic causeway linking the mainland
with northern Jaffna peninsula, 185 miles north of Colombo, the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas launched a fresh offensive last weekend to
recapture Jaffna, which they had lost to the military in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The clandestine rebel radio station Voice of Tiger said more
than 700 government troops had been killed and wounded since
Sunday. The rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam said they lost
only 60 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The radio report, monitored in the northern garrison town of
Vavuniya, also said that 36 civilians who had sought refuge in a
Hindu temple near the Elephant Pass were wounded by an army
artillery barrage.
</P>
<P>
   The military said it killed 150 Tiger rebels and wounded more
than 350 guerrillas since Sunday. It put its loses at 85 soldiers
killed and another 613 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Four rebels were killed Thursday when soldiers fired on
infiltrating rebels near Elephant Pass, the Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Government forces and rebels also exchanged artillery fire. Navy
guns and air force jets attacked a rebel convoy near the pass.
</P>
<P>
   If the rebels succeed in overrunning the pass, they would cut
off the peninsula from the rest of the country and recapture
Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   She did not discuss the fate of a peace initiative launched by
the Norwegian government earlier this year to bring the government
and the separatist guerrillas to the negotiating table after a gap
of nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   Over 61,000 people have been killed since the war began in 1983
in this small island nation off India's southern coast.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are fighting for an independent homeland for minority
Tamils in the north and east of the country. They accuses the
majority Sinhalese community of discriminating against the minority
Tamils in education and jobs.

<HEADLINE> Photographer Freund Dead at 91  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Gisele Freund, whose photographs captured the
attitudes of France's Left Bank literary elite, died Friday. She
was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Cochin Hospital in Paris reported she died there of a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Freund was one of Europe's most prominent photographers and
became a pillar among French feminist intellectuals after settling
in Paris in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac praised Freund as ''one of the world's
greatest photographers.'' Chirac said she ''was able, better than
anyone, to reveal the essence of beings through their
expressions.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1908 to a wealthy Jewish family in Germany, Freund
became a student activist who battled the rise of Hitler's national
socialism. She studied sociology in Frankfurt but was forced to
flee in 1933, escaping just as police were about to arrest her.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, she pursued her doctoral studies at the Sorbonne,
where her enthusiasm for photography was met with some skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   She met militant feminist writer Adrienne Monnier while browsing
at La Maison des Amis du Livre, Monnier's book shop on the Left
Bank. The shop was frequented by Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de
Beauvoir, James Joyce and Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   Monnier became her lifelong mentor and companion, introducing
her to the Parisian intellectual set and encouraging her to pursue
photography.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, Freund executed an acclaimed series of photographs
documenting the misery of British coal miners, and met Andre
Malraux. Her portrait of the author of ''Man's Fate'' -- wrapped in
a trench coat with a cigarette dangling from his mouth -- is among
her most well-known photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Her use of color clashed with the prevailing style of retouched
black-and-white studio portraits, but she persevered, saying color
''was closer to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Freund specialized in conveying attitudes. She focused on hands,
body posture and clothing. Some of her most famous photographs were
published in Life and Time magazines.
</P>

   The Nazi invasion of France in 1940 brought her career to a
halt. Freund fled again, this time to southern France and later
Argentina where she worked until the war's end in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to France where she earned an international
reputation as the photographer of Sartre, De Beauvoir, Jean
Cocteau, and Joyce, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Her works include ''Three Days with Joyce,'' a collection of
black and white photographs showing the Irish writer with friends
and family, and correcting proofs of his famous novel ''Finnegan's
Wake.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Freund was involved in the lives of the artists and writers
she photographed,'' said art critic Ann Cremin who knew Freund.
''She was more of a witness than a reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin hailed Freund as an ''unparalleled
sociologist and reporter who traveled the world with a generous and
lucid approach to places and events faraway.''
</P>
<P>
   Freund won France's National Grand Prize for Photography in
1980. She took the official photograph at the presidential
inauguration of Socialist Francois Mitterrand in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Italian Candidate Takes To the Sea  </HEADLINE>
By VANIA GRANDI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Media magnate and former premier Silvio Berlusconi
took to the sea Friday aboard a luxury liner for a campaign cruise
aimed at building support for his conservative party in Italy's
April 16 regional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi -- whose Fininvest media empire includes three
television stations and a publishing company -- called the cruise an
''antidote'' for a law approved last month that bars political ads
on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The gleaming white-and-blue liner Excellent, leased by
Berlusconi's Forza Italia party for $1.25 million, departed the
northern port of Genoa and headed to Italy's southern tip.
</P>
<P>
   The voyage will include shipboard rallies and fireworks and
stops at 10 ports, winding up April 8 in Venice. The ship is
scheduled to be accompanied by a plane trailing a banner reading
''Italy  Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi's spokesman, Fabrizio Casinelli, said about 100
Italian journalists are aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi, who served briefly as premier in 1994, heads the
opposition to Premier Massimo D'Alema's center-left government.
Berlusconi says D'Alema should resign if the center-left is
defeated in the April 16 nationwide regional elections.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema rejected that advice and denounced the cruise as an
''arrogant show of wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema's 19 months at the helm of the government have been
rocked by a government crisis, which forced him to temporarily
resign, and a stream of bitter internal squabbles.
</P>
<P>
   The center-left pushed through the ban on political ads after
Berlusconi's conservatives scored big in European and regional
elections last year.

<HEADLINE> Bush Questions Clinton's Ethics  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHWAUBENON, Wis. (AP) -- George W. Bush swatted back at
President Clinton on Friday, calling him ''campaign manager for Al
Gore'' and seizing his latest legal woes as a reminder that Clinton
has ''fallen 41 presidents short'' of his promise to be the most
ethical of all U.S. presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke to reporters assembled in a music room of Pioneer
Elementary School, where the Texas GOP governor and likely
presidential nominee campaigned on education one day after Clinton
used a Democratic Party fund-raising speech to criticize Bush on
several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the speech marked the fifth or sixth time in the 2000
presidential race that Clinton ''has taken time out of his busy
schedule to serve as campaign manager for Al Gore. And I am honored
that he would take my campaign so seriously that he would spend
time talking about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Vice President Gore, the presumptive Democratic
nominee, have not yet campaigned together this year. They are
expected to make a joint appearance on April 15, at a Democratic
National Committee fund raiser in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Key to Bush strategy is stirring voter fatigue with Clinton
scandals and lashing Gore to them.
</P>
<P>
   As such, when Brittany, a fifth-grader at Pioneer, asked Bush
what his ''first major step'' as president would be, he said: ''To
remind the administration ... the people that I've asked to serve
in the Cabinet that there's only one standard -- the highest of high
ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   To reporters, his assessment was more harsh, and he used the
swirl around 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez as another opportunity to
underscore that Gore is inextricably linked to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The little boy's fate is subject of an accelerating tug-of-war
between U.S. relatives and his father in Cuba. Gore broke with the
administration by backing legislation to grant Elian and members of
his Cuban family permanent U.S. residency status and by calling for
a family court to decide the case instead of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vice president frequently touts his experience and his
influence'' in the administration, Bush said, challenging Gore to
insist ''that the administration he is part of'' let Elian remain
in the United States while a family court decides his best
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a federal judge's ruling this week that the
president criminally violated a woman's privacy by releasing her
letters during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Bush called it
''another series of incidents that continue to undermine the
credibility of the Clinton-Gore administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush recalled that Clinton, when sworn in 1993 as America's 42nd
president, promised to preside over the most ethical White House in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's fallen about 41 presidents short,'' Bush cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a speech to a Democratic audience on Thursday in New
York, rebuked Bush for ''completely unfair'' campaign ads against
Republican John McCain during the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton was especially harsh in noting that Bush opposed
hate crimes legislation in his state after the murder of James
Byrd, a black Texas man dragged to death on the back of a pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ''All he had to do was to lift his hand and they would have had
a hate crimes bill,'' Clinton said of Bush. ''And it did not pass
because they (Republicans) did not want it to pass. Because they do
not believe that gays and lesbians should be protected by hate
crimes legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not comment Friday on Clinton's specific criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like the administration would like to spend a lot of
time trying to tear me down,'' said Bush, who complained this week
that the Education Department was politicizing its business to
serve Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Spare me,'' replied Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore, who
took Friday off to celebrate his 52nd birthday at home with his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole Republican Party in Washington has been working hand
in glove with Bush to attack Al Gore personally and keep this
campaign away from the real issues that matter to people.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert said Bush could expect more
from Clinton. ''The president is the leader of the Democratic Party
and when he's addressing a Democratic function, he'll make clear he
supports the vice president and his plans for the future, not those
of Governor Bush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Wisconsin for a weekend at home in Austin, Texas,
Bush collected $50,000 for his campaign over a broiled chicken
lunch at Brett Favre's Steak House.

<HEADLINE> Russia: Weapons Disposal Not Started  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Russia admitted Friday that it
hasn't yet started to destroy its chemical weapons stockpiles and
pleaded for increased Western financial aid to help it meet its
commitments under the Chemical Weapons Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said
the United States has already destroyed 17 percent of its
32,000-ton arsenal, comprising around 3 million chemical munitions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the chemical weapons treaty, which went into force in
1997, all 121 signatory states are required to have eliminated 1
percent of their chemical weapons by April 29 and the rest of their
stockpiles by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States account for virtually all of the
world's 8.4 million chemical munitions, according to the
Hague-based organization.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Valery Kapachin, head of Russian's chemical weapons
elimination program, said Moscow remains committed to getting rid
of its 40,000-ton chemical weapons arsenal, containing 4 million to
5 million munitions. However, he said it cannot cover the $6
billion price tag on current promises of assistance from the United
States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't destroyed anything as of today,'' Kapachin told
reporters after meetings with OPCW officials.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to specify the amount of requested aid.
</P>
<P>
   Valery Semin, a Russian foreign ministry official, said Canada
and Norway this week joined the seven other donor countries in
pledging to help Russia.
</P>
<P>
   However, pledge figures were not given because donor countries
want to target their assistance to specific projects.
</P>
<P>
   Max Gevers, the Dutch representative to the OPCW, said ''very
little money, if any'' had been spent so far because of delays in
setting up chemical weapons elimination and conversion projects in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a considerable amount of delay. It's not a
matter of whose fault it is, it's a diplomatic fact,'' he said.
''We are at this moment considering together with Russia different
options with respect to speeding up the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Russia requested an extension. The OPCW's
executive body is scheduled to discuss the request next week and
issue a decision in May, said Ron Manley, the organization's acting
director of verification.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said the extension is likely to be granted if
officials are persuaded that Russia is serious about its
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's important at the end of the day is that Russia's
chemical weapons are destroyed,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Arrests Dissidents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Peacekeepers in Sierra Leone have
arrested 16 alleged dissidents suspected of fomenting instability
in neighboring Liberia, a senior official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Without identifying the suspects, National Security Adviser
Sheka Mansaray said the 16 were apprehended in the Gola Forest,
about 230 miles east of Freetown near the Liberian border.
</P>
<P>
   Mansaray said in a state radio broadcast that officers of a
multinational West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, believed the
suspects planned to cause instability in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   He did not give details of the arrests, but said that Sierra
Leone was committed to preventing dissident groups from using its
territory as a base.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia and Sierra Leone have frequently exchanged accusations
of supporting each others' rebel movements.
</P>
<P>
   A peace accord last July ended Sierra Leone's 8-year civil war,
in which tens of thousands were killed or maimed by rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia's 7-year war ended in 1996 after more than 200,000
people were killed by various factions, including one led by
President Charles Taylor, who won elections in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly higher today as investors
shook off their distress over plummeting technology shares and
began looking for bargains after a weeklong selloff.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was up 140.01 at 4,597.90 after dropping 187
points on Thursday. The index had been lower for most of the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 106.10 at 11,075.80, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 27.47 at 1,515.39.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq began moving higher on the strength of stalwarts like
Dell Computer, up 2} at 54 15/16, and Intel, up 7 11/16 at 134
11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems rose 3} to 77] and JDS Uniphase gained 5 5/16 to
121 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree Holdings rose 8{ to 69{ after a Lehman Brothers
analyst issued a ''buy'' rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Some steep losses by technology stocks prevented the Nasdaq from
recovering even more ground. Shares of drkoop.com, the online
health information provider, fell 42 percent, or by 2 19/32, to 3
21/32 after auditors questioned the viability of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet company hit hard was Ariba, which helps
companies track sales on the Web. The stock was down 14 at 206
after a Prudential Securities analyst downgraded the stock to
''accumulate'' from ''strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel and Hewlett-Packard, up 4 9/16 to 135 5/16, paced the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco fell about 16 percent after the insurance and financial
services company said it will record a $350 million charge and may
sell its consumer finance unit. Shares were down 2 3/16 at 11{.
</P>
<P>
   The market was somewhat rattled by a pair of economic reports
released this morning that provided a mixed picture of the
economy's strength.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported that personal income rose 0.4
percent in February but that Americans' spending rose more than
twice as fast. That pulled the nation's savings rate down to an
all-time monthly low, and fueled expectations that the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates at least once more this year in
its bid to slow the economy to sustainable levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no signs of any significant slowdown for consumer
spending,'' said Stan Shipley, senior economist at Merrill Lynch.
''The economy is clearly growing too fast for the Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some market watchers drew encouragement from a second report
that showed orders to U.S. factories were down for the second
straight month in February. Orders for airplanes and other
transportation equipment took their biggest plunge in 10 months,
dropping 8.9 percent. Industrial machinery orders fell 4.8 percent,
the steepest decline since October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 704.52 million
shares, down from 778.66 million shares at the same time Thursday.
Breadth on the Nasdaq improved, with advancers leading by a 4-to-3
margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small company stocks was up 11.72 at
543.29.

<HEADLINE> Braun To Receive German Prize  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARMSTADT, Germany (AP) -- Volker Braun, an author from the
former East Germany who predicted the fall of that communist
country's society, is to be awarded Germany's top literary honor,
the Academy for Languages and Poetry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Braun, 60, a socialist who developed into a strong critic of the
Stalinist East German system, is to receive the $30,000 George
Buechner Prize in Darmstadt in October, academy spokeswoman Corinna
Blattmann said.
</P>
<P>
   The academy announced its decision during a meeting in Krakow,
Poland, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Braun's 1987 book, ''The Temporary Society,'' predicted East
Germany's demise two years before the Berlin Wall fell in November
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Other works he wrote were suppressed and not available to the
public. Those include the 1970 documentary ''Lenin's Death,'' which
described the depressing reality in post-revolutionary Russia. It
was unavailable until 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The author is seen as an excellent representative of East German
literature and a literary pioneer in foreseeing the changes that
took place there, the academy said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Syrian Proposals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The standoff in peacemaking between Israel and
Syria grew more intractable Friday as the Clinton administration
said it had no basis for reopening negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''One needs something to work with,'' State Department spokesman
James Foley said, ''and right now we don't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Damascus, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa was
quoted as saying the solution to making the peace process work is
in the hands of United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ball is in his court now,'' al-Sharaa said in reply to
President Clinton's statement Tuesday that the options for peace
are now before Syrian President Hafez Assad after their weekend
summit in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ball is not in Syria's court, but in Israel's court,''
al-Sharaa said in an interview with the Lebanese newspaper
Al-Mustaqbal. ''If we want to escalate, we might add that the ball
is also in America's court.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday's Clinton-Assad meeting in Switzerland had been
expected to produce Syrian agreement to resume peace negotiations
with Israel, which broke down in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa said that at the summit, Clinton conveyed Israel's
demand for ''full sovereignty over the Jordan River waters and the
Sea of Galilee.'' Assad rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Friday at the State Department, Foley would not discuss the
issues in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, ''If we are going to be able to carry the ball
forward, we need some elaboration from the Syrian side'' on its
position.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has insisted on recovering all territory held by Syria
before it was defeated in the 1967 Middle East war. Clinton said
Tuesday that Israel has made ''very significant'' proposals, and
Assad has to say more in response.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may take time,'' Foley said.

<HEADLINE> Basketball Fans Beat Up in Bosnia  </HEADLINE>
By IRENA GAJIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- The Bosnian Serb prime
minister publicly apologized Friday for letting his bodyguards beat
up rival basketball fans after a game involving the team he runs.
</P>
<P>
   Three young men were treated for head injuries after four of
Milorad Dodik's security staff attacked them. The incident followed
the Bosnian Serb basketball championship Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Igokea, the team of which Dodik is a longtime fan and president,
beat Borac 90-79, knocking Borac from its six-year-long run as
champion. After the game, Dodik joined the players and the rest of
the club's leadership in celebrating the win. The prime minister
turned to the Borac fans, showing them the traditional
three-fingered Serb sign for victory.
</P>
<P>
   The fans responded with vulgarities, and chanted the names of
Dodik's political opponents in upcoming local elections.
</P>
<P>
   Dodik's security then ran over to the Borac side and started
attacking fans. Local police looked on without reacting.
</P>
<P>
   Three men were treated for head injuries at the nearby medical
center, Dr. Bosko Miljevic said. No other details were available.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-line opposition Bosnian Serb Democratic Party issued a
statement Friday calling the incident a ''brutal attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ''His behavior is no different than the way he performs in the
parliament, where he wildly threatens his political opponents,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Dodik also issued a press release Friday apologizing for the
incident. He said two members of his security team were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am aware ... that such matches are always an excuse of
raising tensions, especially now ahead of the elections,'' Dodik
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Dodik enjoys support from the West for his moderate policies.
But many people in the Serb-run half of Bosnia are fed up with what
they see as his arrogance.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules for Dr. Dre  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge has ruled in favor of Dr. Dre in a
dispute over a 1991 contract with a music industry executive,
calling the deal ''unconscionably unfair'' to the rap singer.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Malcom Mackey said the statute
of limitations had run out on the contract, making music mogul Dick
Griffey's attempt to bring any damage claims against the rapper a
moot point.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dre -- born Andre Young -- says he never signed the contract
in which he supposedly agreed to give Griffey 25 percent of his
profits from 1991 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Griffey agreed to serve as the rapper's mentor.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Farmers To Cut Biotech Plantings  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers are turning away from genetically
engineered crops, especially a biotech corn that's toxic to
insects, amid consumer resistance that started overseas and is now
being felt in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Plantings of the gene-altered corn are projected to drop 24
percent this year, according to findings of an Agriculture
Department survey released Friday. The report also suggested
declines in biotech varieties of cotton and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to go out here and spend any more money ... than
we absolutely have to,'' said Allan Morris, who farms near Mason,
Ill. ''We can't afford to do that with the margins we have in
agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   Biotech crops had caught on quickly in the late 1990s despite
the relatively high cost of the seed.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans were the first to balk at buying biotech grain, which
wary Britons have dubbed ''Frankenfoods,'' but there is also
resistance in Asia, and a handful of U.S. companies now are turning
them down, including babyfood makers and snack-food giant Frito-Lay
Inc. U.S. regulators insist that the biotech crops are no different
from conventional versions.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech corn, known as Bt corn for a bacteria corn that it
contains, became especially controversial last year after a Cornell
University study suggested it could be killing Monarch butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   According to the USDA survey, farmers in major corn-producing
states intend to plant 19 percent of their corn acreage this year
to the Bt variety, down from 25 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Plantings of biotech cotton are projected to decline from 55
percent last year to 48 percent in 2000. Some 52 percent of this
year's soybean acreage is expected to be a biotech variety that is
resistant to a popular herbicide. About 57 percent of soybeans last
year were herbicide resistant, including a small amount that was
conventionally bred.
</P>
<P>
   ''Producers are just trying to protect themselves. The industry
seems to be saying they want less biotech and that's what their
interest is, going to where the industry is telling them to go,''
said Don Roose, an analyst with U.S. Commodities Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Farm groups had expected the reduction in biotech corn because
of resistance to the crop in overseas markets and a decline in
infestations of the European corn borer, the pest the corn is
designed to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Farmers need markets. They always say the consumer is king,
and the consumer in this case isn't that interested in genetically
engineered corn,'' said Margaret Mellon of the Union of Concerned
Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Seed companies have insisted that demand for biotech varieties
is in line with last year, although some have been offering
discounts to farmers to maintain sales. Monsanto Co.'s biotech
sales are ''flat to marginally better'' than last year, said
spokesman Dan Verakis.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Dittrich, who farms near Tilden, Neb., planted at least 75
percent of his corn and soybean acreage to biotech varieties last
year and isn't cutting back. They save work and reduce the need for
insecticides and herbicides, he said. ''I haven't seen any proof
that it's not safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Morris, the Illinois farmer, planted Bt seed on just 10
percent of his corn acreage in 1999 and said he's going to grow
even less this year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, farmers plan to plant an estimated 77.9 million acres
of corn this year, up 1 percent from 1999, and a record 74.9
million acres of soybeans, also a 1 percent increase, according to
the USDA survey.
</P>
<P>
   Total cotton plantings are expected to reach 15.6 million acres
this year, an increase of 5 percent from last year, and the
second-largest acreage since 1962. Sugarbeet acreage is expected to
rise by 1 percent to 1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat acreage is expected to total 61.7 million acres, down 2
percent from 1999, reflecting a shift to crops that producers
consider more lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans have become increasingly popular with farmers in recent
years because of federal price supports that make the crop more
profitable than some other commodities, according to analysts.

<HEADLINE> French NATO Officer Shot in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A French officer in the NATO peacekeeping force in
Kosovo was shot to death by a fellow French soldier, NATO
peacekeepers said Friday. It was not immediately clear if the
shooting was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old French lieutenant, whose name was not
immediately released, was shot Thursday night in the ethnically
divided city of Kosovska Mitrovica by a French soldier who had
recently arrived in Kosovo, Lt. Fabrice Turco said.
</P>
<P>
   The army spokesman said the attack did not appear to be linked
to military affairs, although the reasons behind it were still
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier accused in the shooting had enlisted two years ago
and served in previous missions abroad, said Lt. Col. Charles de
Kersabiec, an army spokesman. The soldier, whose name was not
released, was sent back to France for psychological reasons, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were talking privately when people nearby heard
gunshots and rushed over, de Kersabiec said. The soldier
immediately claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   French defense authorities in Kosovo have opened an inquiry into
the shooting.

<HEADLINE> Larry Flynt To Open Adult Bookstore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt
promised to find another downtown location for his adult bookstore
after it was closed last year. Now it appears he's keeping that
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt said Thursday he and his brother would open a new downtown
store within a week.
</P>
<P>
   The store will sell some sexually explicit material, but he said
most of the merchandise will be mainstream items such as clothing
and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to maintain a presence downtown,'' he said. ''Just
to be a thorn in their (city officials) side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flynts closed two downtown Cincinnati stores after disputes
with the city over its sexually oriented business law.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager John Shirey was not pleased about the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can do what we always do, enforce city ordinances,'' he
said. ''But that doesn't occur until after they open.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flynts said the new store would comply with the city law
banning businesses from downtown if a ''significant or
substantial'' amount of the merchandise is sexually explicit.

<HEADLINE> Panel Probes Judge in Clinton Case  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A special panel is beginning an investigation
of the chief federal judge in the District of Columbia because she
assigned six Whitewater and campaign fund-raising prosecutions to
Clinton appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals Judge Stephen Williams chose four judges -- three
Republicans and a Clinton appointee -- to help him delve into why
Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson bypassed the
computerized system of randomly assigning cases. In 1998 and 1999,
Johnson sent six cases against presidential friends and Democratic
fund-raisers to judges nominated by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a Reagan appointee, threw out an initial complaint
against Johnson filed by a private group after an Associated Press
story revealed the first two of the six cases -- prosecutions
against Clinton fund-raiser Charlie Trie and longtime presidential
friend Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   But the court's 13-member Judicial Council reopened the
complaint, filed by the conservative group Judicial Watch, after
Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., presented additional evidence that
Johnson also directed four other fund-raising cases to Clinton
appointees.
</P>
<P>
   They included the case against Miami businessman Howard Glicken,
a former Al Gore fund-raiser who pleaded guilty to two fund-raising
misdemeanors. Presidential confidant Vernon Jordan wrote the
sentencing judge pleading for leniency. Glicken got community
service work and probation.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to a newspaper last summer, the chief judge said she
made the special assignments of the Hubbell and Trie cases to
''move the docket as expeditiously as possible'' and that politics
was ''never a factor.'' She hasn't spoken publicly about why she
bypassed the random assignment system in the other four cases.
</P>
<P>
   Launching a full-scale judicial investigation of a judge is a
serious step that court rules call a ''last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Subpoena power is available to the panel and the investigation
will almost certainly result in Johnson submitting to questioning
under oath by her fellow judges, either in writing or in person.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member panel will turn over its findings to the
Judicial Council of appeals court and district judges in
Washington, which can issue a censure or reprimand or refer the
matter to the Judicial Conference of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to Coble and Judicial Watch on Tuesday, Williams
named the four Washington-based judges he appointed to help him
with the inquiry:
</P>
<P>
   --Judith W. Rogers, a Clinton appointee on the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   --A. Raymond Randolph, a Bush appointee on the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   --U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan, a Reagan appointee.
</P>
<P>
   --U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, a Reagan
appointee.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Rotunda, a former member of prosecutor Ken Starr's staff,
criticized Johnson's special assignments this month in The Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a gradual accumulation of evidence ... that when
criminal cases important to President Clinton were assigned and
decided in the federal district court in Washington, D.C. ...
politics controlled,'' Rotunda wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A written guide to federal courthouse rules in the District of
Columbia states that when a complaint is made against a judge,
''formal investigatory procedures are to be regarded as a last
resort.''
</P>
<P>
   The guide says the law is ''better and more promptly served if
an informal solution can be found that will correct the problem
giving rise to a complaint.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Oil, Gas Rig Count Rises by 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and
natural gas in the United States increased this week by seven to
775.
</P>
<P>
   Of the rigs running nationwide, 173 were exploring for oil and
601 were looking for gas, Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. reported
Friday. During the same week last year, 503 rigs were operating in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since 1944. The tally
peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil boom
but set several record lows last year, bottoming out at 498 on
April 9, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, Louisiana gained two
and New Mexico gained one.
</P>
<P>
   California lost two, while the counts in Alaska, Oklahoma,
Wyoming and Texas were unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Jonestown Killings Similar  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS TOMLINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Led by persuasive clergy offering a better life with spiritual
meaning, Africans who joined the cult in Uganda and Americans who
followed Jim Jones to Guyana lived similar lives and met the same
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Both cults were offshoots of Christianity and both were located
in remote regions of poor, tropical countries. Both were also
virtually unknown until their leaders -- apparently fearing the
dissolution of the congregations that worshipped them -- launched
their own versions of the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end for Jones' followers came when Rep. Leo
Ryan, a California Democrat, traveled to the colony in South
America to investigate reports that the Peoples Temple was abusing
its members and holding some against their will.
</P>
<P>
   When Ryan's delegation prepared to leave Jonestown on Nov. 18,
1978, cult members killed him and four other Americans. Within a
few hours, Jim Jones was serving his followers cyanide-laced punch,
a ritual the 1,000-member group had rehearsed many times in
preparation for the end of the world. At least 913 people died,
including some who were shot.
</P>
<P>
   In Uganda, the first sign of trouble within the Movement for the
Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God came when the chapel at
their main compound erupted into flames with an estimated 530
people trapped inside by doors and windows that had been nailed
shut.
</P>
<P>
   One of the group's leaders, Credonia Mwerinde, reportedly had
said the Virgin Mary was unhappy and that the world would end on
Dec. 31. Investigators hypothesize that some of the 1,000 mostly
Ugandan cult members -- of whom 924 would be found dead -- grew
restless when the prophecy proved false and demanded the return of
the possessions they had given sect leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The church fire turned out to be only the end of the killing.
Ugandan police have since found 394 bodies at cult compounds. While
it is clear there was foul play involved, the exact causes of death
have not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Both cults made unusual demands on members and sought complete
obedience and loyalty. Followers were told to give all their
belongings to the cults and families were split apart with
nonbelievers considered to be evil.
</P>
<P>
   Children lived separately from their parents and went to special
schools. Self-sufficiency and a break with the outside world also
characterized both cults, which promised a Utopian lifestyle, but
provided totalitarian rule in an agrarian setting.
</P>
<P>
   The cults also had their own idiosyncratic practices. In Uganda,
members were not allowed to speak and used an elaborate sign
language to communicate. Jones required his followers to write
self-critical letters to him. They were addressed ''Dear Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   One key difference, though, is that while Jones was found among
the dead, investigators suspect the Ugandan cult leaders may still
be on the loose.

<HEADLINE> WTO Panel Rejects U.S. Dumping Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- A World Trade Organization panel on Friday ruled
illegal a U.S. law which has been used by American steel companies
to fend off low-priced imports.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of experts said the 1916 Anti-Dumping Act was in
contravention of WTO rules which the United States is committed to
observe. The law was investigated following a complaint by the
European Union, supported by Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the panel said the law was illegal because it
allowed for fines and imprisonment for companies and individuals
found guilty of dumping, as well as the payment of damages. Under
WTO rules, import tariffs are the only remedies allowed to combat
dumping.
</P>
<P>
   The 1916 law, created to fend off unfair competition after the
end of World War I had been considered obsolete until the U.S.
company Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. brought a lawsuit against
importers of Russian and Japanese hot-rolled steel in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Wheeling, W. Va., claimed the companies
were guilty of dumping -- selling steel at below-cost prices to
unfairly gain market share. Some of the defendants settled with
Wheeling-Pitt while other cases still have to go to court.
</P>
<P>
   In April last year a U.S. federal judge ruled that the action
was constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has the right to appeal the decision. If it
loses the appeal, it is expected to change its law to conform with
WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
   A series of complaints about U.S. actions over steel imports
have been taken to the WTO. In December, another WTO panel ruled
that Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act -- a more widely-used
anti-dumping law -- was legal, but added that the United States
could not impose sanctions without WTO permission.

<HEADLINE> Pay Soars for GM Boss and Top Execs  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE, AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A banner year for the American auto industry
resulted in banner year for salaries of top executives at General
Motors Corp., including chairman and CEO Jack Smith who saw his pay
more than double.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was paid $6.9 million in salary, bonus and dividends,
compared with $3.2 million in 1998. In addition, Smith cashed in
previously granted stock options worth $6 million, was given $5.25
million in stock under a long-term executive incentive plan and was
granted an estimated $7.9 million in stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Smith -- who will hand over the title of CEO on June 1 to G.
Richard Wagoner, currently GM's president -- had a total
compensation package worth about $26 million, compared with $12.4
million in 1998. The totals assume a current value for stock
options that could change based on future stock performance.
</P>
<P>
   Like most large corporations, top executive pay at GM is
determined in large part by formulas how each automaker met
financial and management goals for the year and, in the case of
stock options, over several years. Thanks to a record market for
new vehicles in the United States last year, GM hit most of its
targets, with earnings of $5.6 billion, up 87 percent over 1998,
when strikes shut down North American production.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation totals can also vary widely year to year based
on the amount of previously granted stock options the executive
decides to cash in and the extent to which the company's financial
performance affects long-term incentive plan payouts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to last year's compensation, GM's board of directors
gave Smith a 5 percent raise at the beginning of the year, boosting
his base salary to $2.05 million.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation for Smith, Wagoner and three other top GM
executives are included in GM's annual proxy statement filed Friday
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission:
</P>
<P>
   --Wagoner was paid $4.3 million in salary, bonus and dividends;
he also received stock options worth $4 million, was paid $2.25
million in stock under the long-term incentive plan, and cashed in
stock options worth $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Harry Pearce, GM's vice chairman, was paid $4.3 million in
salary, bonus and dividends; received stock options worth $3
million, was paid $2.25 million in stock under the long-term
incentive plan, and cashed in $683,000 in stock options.
</P>
<P>
   --J. Michael Losh, the chief financial officer, was paid $2.4
million in salary, bonus and dividends; received stock options
worth $1.8 million, was given $1.8 million in stock under the
long-term incentive plan and cashed in stock options worth $3.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   --Ron Zarella, GM's vice president for North America, was paid $2
million in salary, bonus and dividends; received stock options
worth $1.8 million, was given $1.5 million in stock under long-term
incentive plan and cashed in stock options worth $2.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Census Officials Await 'Census Day'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As lawmakers squabble over the intrusiveness
of questions, Census Bureau officials hope those who haven't yet
mailed back their forms will do so Saturday, Census Day.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau sent questionnaires to the country's 115 million
households in March, but officially they want to know how many
people are living in your home on April 1. That is because the
once-a-decade count must be tied to a specific point in time.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, 49 percent of census forms were mailed back.
Census officials hoped to get 70 percent of the forms back by late
April.
</P>
<P>
   Several congressional Republicans grumbled this week about the
intrusiveness of census forms, citing complaints from constituents
that the questionnaire invaded their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate majority
leader, said they strongly urged people to return forms but
suggested that callers worried about privacy could leave intrusive
questions unanswered. That was a better solution than not returning
a form, Lott's staff said.
</P>
<P>
   Census director Kenneth Prewitt said he was unsure how the
controversy would affect the willingness of people to completely
fill out and return forms. Census officials were hoping for a spike
in the response rate after April 1, thinking some people may have
held on to their forms until then.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Said To Seek $22-$28 Oil Price  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- OPEC plans to increase oil output
whenever the price of the cartel's crude basket exceeds $28 a
barrel and lower output when the price dips below $22, Venezuelan
Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the new president of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, said the price-band plan was approved by OPEC
members during their meeting earlier this week in Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The system, which will allow quick supply changes to keep oil
prices within a set range, had been proposed by Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez told a news conference here that if prices move
outside the set range for 20 consecutive days, the oil cartel will
increase or decrease production by 500,000 barrels a day until the
price moves back within the range.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the additional production would be divided among
the members based on their individual production quotas.
Venezuela's share amounts to 11.8 percent or 59,000 barrels a day,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC keeps watch on prices by calculating the value of a
''basket'' of seven different crude oils. The year-to-date average
basket price is $26.24, which is about the level being bid for
future deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Crude for delivery in May closed Friday at $26.90, up 20 cents,
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while front-month Brent crude
from the North Sea closed up 14 cents at $24.77 on the
International Petroleum Exchange in London.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was elected to a one-year term in a move that some
experts said was to reward Venezuela for reversing its
long-standing role as the cartel's perennial quota buster.
</P>
<P>
   At its Vienna meeting, OPEC agreed to increase production by
about 1.7 million barrels a day. The total world increase is likely
to reach 2 million barrels a day because non-OPEC producers Mexico
and Norway said they would raise production, and because OPEC
members continue to cheat on their quotas.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other oil-importing countries, which have
seen gasoline and heating oil prices soar in recent months, sought
output increases of between 2 million and 2.5 million barrels a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela is the world's third biggest petroleum exporter and
one of the top foreign suppliers of oil to the United States.
Petroleum accounts for more than three quarters of the South
American nation's export earnings.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Hugo Chavez confirmed Venezuela would
increase its oil output by 125,000 barrels a day under the new OPEC
accord aimed at reining in oil prices that had reached nine-year
highs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a group of businessmen, Chavez said the increase is
the ''motor'' that will stimulate Venezuela's stalled economy,
which contracted by 7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Others say, however, that the output hike isn't likely to
jump-start the economy because it's too modest.

<HEADLINE> Shares Are Mixed in Europe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- European shares were mixed on Friday, as investors
continued to sell technology stocks and seek refuge in so-called
Old Economy shares.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the European session, the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx
Index, which tracks companies in countries that joined the single
currency, was up 0.82 points, or 0.2 percent, at 441.07. The Dow
Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index was down 2.4 points, at 5,249.6.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies rose
2.44 points, or 0.6 percent, to 394.10, while the Dow Jones Stoxx
50 Index rose 33.6 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,059.1.
</P>
<P>
   London's FTSE 100 closed 1.5 percent higher to 6,540.2, but
Paris's CAC-40 was down 0.4 percent at 6,286.05 and in Frankfurt
the Xetra DAX closed down 0.6 percent to 7,584.41.
</P>
<P>
   London's blue-chip index was supported by strong oil stocks and
a spread of old economy stocks. But technology stocks suffered in
response to Nasdaq's 4.0 percent slide Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, technology, media and telecommunications stocks
dropped sharply in early trading and failed to maintain subsequent
gains.
</P>
<P>
   In Frankfurt, old economy stocks rallied and Siemens and
Deutsche Telekom recovered, but a profit warning from Ixos Software
pushed the DAX into negative territory.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Doubles Iraq Oil Equipment  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council decided Friday to let
Iraq spend more money to repair its oil industry -- an investment
intended to boost the amount of food and medicine Baghdad can buy
through the U.N. humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid welcomed the decision,
which he called a victory for Iraq. ''When good insists ... evil
backs down,'' Rashid said, speaking in Baghdad before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   All 15 ambassadors voted in favor of the U.S.-sponsored
resolution without comment.
</P>
<P>
   Independent oil industry experts have said Iraq must
rehabilitate its pumping stations if it wants to continue exporting
crude through the U.N. oil-for-food program, which lets Baghdad buy
humanitarian goods using proceeds from U.N.-supervised oil sales.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad's oil industry -- its main source of revenue -- was
targeted during the Persian Gulf War and has been decimated by
nearly 10 years of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. oil-for-food program was started in 1996 to provide for
Iraqis suffering under sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Security Council agreed to allow Iraq to use $300
million every six months from oil-for-food proceeds to buy spare
parts. Friday's resolution increases that to $600 million every six
months, in line with recommendations from Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and oil experts, so that vital repairs can be made.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also says the council would be willing to
consider other ways to improve the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock urged Iraq to take
advantage of the new spare parts allowance, which he said would
enable Baghdad to export more oil and buy more goods to meet the
needs of its people.
</P>
<P>
   ''This extra revenue and the welcome decision by the government
of Iraq to increase its oil production will bring a significant new
element of cash into the program,'' Greenstock told reporters after
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   After refusing for months, the United States agreed to the
measure and sponsored the resolution to try to deflect criticism of
its tough line on Iraq sanctions, which has come under increasing
fire at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Ambassador James Cunningham introduced the draft on
March 24 during an open debate of the council at which most
ambassadors and Annan himself criticized the U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, they complained that the United States was paralyzing
repairs on the oil industry by placing more than $1 billion in
contracts for spare parts and other equipment on ''hold'' in the
U.N. sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
   Washington says it has to review the contracts to make sure the
equipment isn't used to help Iraqi President Saddam Hussein rebuild
his weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Caps Curb Retirees' Costs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare announced new rules Friday that will
limit older Americans' out-of-pocket costs for hospital outpatient
services starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The change will cap Medicare copayments for services received in
hospital-owned outpatient care centers -- such as one-day surgery,
radiology and rehabilitation therapy -- at a maximum equivalent to
the program's inpatient hospital deductible. That's $776 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most other services for which a retiree pays a standard
20 percent out-of-pocket share of the bill, with Medicare picking
up 80 percent, copayments for outpatient services vary widely but
average about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, that disparity is scheduled to diminish
gradually, as the government slowly picks up more outpatient costs.
But getting outpatient copays to the standard 20 percent is
projected to take decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Congress and the Clinton administration agreed
last fall to institute a new dollar-amount limit.
</P>
<P>
   The cap will apply separately to each outpatient service. For
example, each visit during a course of radiation therapy would be
treated separately, and a patient could conceivably receive
multiple services, each subject to a separate cap, during a single
trip to an outpatient center.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, the new caps will have limited impact, mainly
reducing beneficiaries' bills for particularly expensive outpatient
services such as one-day surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many retirees buy supplemental private insurance that
covers Medicare copays.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 114; Dow Ends Down 58.33  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks edged back from the brink
today, pulling the Nasdaq composite higher for the first time since
last Friday. Investors turned toward well-established computer
makers and networking companies, shunning newer Internet businesses
that were seen as riskier investments at the end of a volatile
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose 114.70 to close at 4,572.59. In
earlier trading, the Nasdaq had fallen as much as 76 points and
appeared to be in danger of extending its losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq finished the week with a loss of 390 points, and is
9.4 percent below its March 10 record of 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   Other stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average gave up solid early gains and closed down 58.33 at
10,921.92.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 10.66 to 1,498.58.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 2,017 up, 1,073 down and 401
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.20 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.17
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.84 to 538.41.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq rose as investors bought stocks that were beaten down
in this week's technology selloff. Stalwarts like Dell Computer and
Intel rose significantly. Hewlett-Packard paced the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also embraced companies that build the infrastructure
of computers. Cisco Systems and JDS Uniphase rose.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of technology stocks' disastrous performance this
week, investors were exercising extreme caution, said Charles
White, president and portfolio manager at Avatar Associates in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stocks doing well today are the ones you've always wanted
to own, the ones with good products, strong revenues and solid
business models,'' he said. ''The companies without those
attributes are going to have a very hard time for the foreseeable
future.''
</P>
<P>
   White pointed to drkoop.com, the online health information
provider, which fell 42 percent after auditors questioned the
viability of the company.
</P>
<P>
   E.Spire Communications, a struggling provider of Internet access
and phone services, fell for a second consecutive session after
saying it may not have enough cash to continue its operations and
pay back its loans through the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Business-to-business Internet companies declined broadly after
Prudential Securities downgraded several stocks in the sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one will argue that technology stocks are cheap, but some
are more justifiable than others,'' White said. ''You have to be
selective.''
</P>
<P>
   The resurgence of the Nasdaq drew some money out of the
blue-chip stocks that have performed well this week. General
Electric fell.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco fell about 16 percent after the insurance and financial
services company said it will record a $350 million charge and may
sell its consumer finance unit.
</P>
<P>
   The market was somewhat rattled by a pair of economic reports
released this morning that provided a mixed picture of the
economy's strength.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported that personal income rose 0.4
percent in February but that Americans' spending rose more than
twice as fast. That pulled the nation's savings rate down to an
all-time monthly low, and fueled expectations that the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates at least once more this year in
its bid to slow the economy to sustainable levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no signs of any significant slowdown for consumer
spending,'' said Stan Shipley, senior economist at Merrill Lynch.
''The economy is clearly growing too fast for the Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some market watchers drew encouragement from a second report
that showed orders to U.S. factories were down for the second
straight month in February.

<HEADLINE> Boy Says He Didn't Shoot Classmate  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH ALTMAN Jr., Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- With little more than his eyes and nose
visible over the witness stand, a 6-year-old boy denied Friday that
he shot classmate Kayla Rolland to death and blamed another
first-grader.
</P>
<P>
   The boy testified at a preliminary hearing for Jamelle James,
19, who is accused of carelessly storing the semiautomatic handgun
that the 6-year-old allegedly found and used to kill Kayla on Feb.
29. James is charged with involuntary manslaughter; the 6-year-old
isn't charged.
</P>
<P>
   The boy had to be coaxed into the witness box and barely spoke
above a whisper for the 45 minutes he was on the stand. His voice
was so quiet, attorneys had to repeat what he said for the court.
Often he answered questions simply by shaking his head, looked at
the floor or stared blankly at the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Judge John L. Conover chatted with the boy and his 8-year-old
brother about sports and television to determine they were
competent to take the stand. Before the boys testified, Conover
ordered all cameras, microphones and a sketch artist out of the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old testified that he had seen James playing with the
gun and demonstrated how James twirled it in his hands. The
prosecutor had to copy the hand motions for the judge because the
boy was too short to be seen behind the witness box.
</P>
<P>
   The boy said he had seen the gun and some quarters in a shoebox
in James' room -- an answer he gave after prosecutor Daniel Stamos
reminded him that was what he had told police.
</P>
<P>
   The boy said he remembered Kayla being shot. But when asked if
he shot her, he shook his head ''no,'' and blamed another boy to
whom he said he had given the gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't playing with the gun, I wasn't,'' the boy said.
</P>
<P>
   Stamos asked, ''Do you remember telling police Kayla was shot by
accident?''
</P>
<P>
   He nodded ''yes.'' But when asked if he caused the accident, he
shook his head ''no.''
</P>
<P>
   During a break, Stamos also said some of the boy's testimony
differed from earlier interviews with prosecutors, but he wouldn't
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters the inconsistency was normal for a young
witness.
</P>
<P>
   ''A 6- or a 5- or a 4-year-old can say they don't remember when
they really do. And then when you focus them on it, they do
remember,'' Stamos said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's 8-year-old brother, wearing a nearly identical outfit
of blue pants and white dress shirt, appeared much more at ease,
answering questions audibly, smiling and swiveling back and forth
in the chair.
</P>
<P>
   He testified the 6-year-old showed him a gun at home before
school on the morning Kayla was killed. He said he knocked on
James' bedroom door to tell him, but there was no answer. The
8-year-old said he thought James might be sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the boys' 22-year-old uncle, Sir Marcus Winfrey,
testified that James sometimes showed off the gun around the house
and pretended to shoot people, but never in front of the boys -- who
had been staying at the home with James and Winfrey before the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he would not rule on whether James will stand
trial until Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Men Said To Focus on White House Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women are slightly less likely than men to be
interested in the presidential campaign and more likely to be
dissatisfied with politics, according to a four-month series of
polls released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But women also are more likely than men to believe the election
will make a difference in their lives, according to the surveys for
Harvard University's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics
and Public Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone surveys of about 1,000 adults each, conducted from
Nov. 10 through March 26, found several areas of voter behavior
beyond the ''gender gap'' of women tending to vote for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women, for example, have not paid equal attention to
this year's presidential race. On average, 37 percent of men said
they had thought about the campaign in the past day, compared with
32 percent of women.
</P>
<P>
   Women, meanwhile, were more likely than men to be dissatisfied
with politics and politicians. A survey conducted March 1-5 showed
that 76 percent of the women respondents on average felt that
politics is ''disgusting,'' compared with 67 percent of men on
average.
</P>
<P>
   However, more women than men feel that this election is an
important one. Along the course of the surveys, an average of 29
percent of women said the election would make a great deal of
difference in their lives, compared with an average of 25 percent
of men.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, men and women had virtually the same opinions
and perceptions, the survey showed. For example, one-fifth of both
men and women say that people like them have a great deal or quite
a bit of influence on what the government does.
</P>
<P>
   Because some questions were asked only of some of the
respondents, the margin of error ranged from plus or minus 3
percentage points to 6 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Erupts in Northern Japan  </HEADLINE>
By KOJI SASAHARA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- A volcano in northern Japan erupted Friday
for the first time in 22 years, sending a spectacular blue-gray
plume of molten rock and ash billowing two miles above the crater
and rolling down the snow-quilted slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Ash dusted silent, evacuated villages near Mount Usu. The only
other noise came from sirens screaming warnings and ambulances and
police cars cruising in search of damage.
</P>
<P>
   Farther away from the volcano people streamed into the streets
and climbed to rooftops to watch the towering cloud that blossomed
from the eruption. Some snapped photographs of debris that rose two
miles high for over two hours.
</P>
<P>
   But those in the nearby city of Date who weren't looking out a
window would barely have known that 2,416-foot Mount Usu was
erupting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't feel anything, I didn't hear anything,'' said
Norimichi Nagao, who works for the nearby city on Japan's
northernmost main island of Hokkaido. ''I didn't even know that
there was an eruption until I saw it on television.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. But more
than 11,000 people evacuated from communities at Usu's base after
the earth began rumbling earlier this week faced another night in
rescue centers as officials warned that it too early to say danger
had been averted.
</P>
<P>
   Snow fell Friday evening, increasing concerns about mudslides in
the lakeside resort area. The military was called in because of
concerns over the possibility of landslides or mudslides caused by
melting runoff. Two people were killed and 200 homes destroyed in
mudslides following Usu's last eruptions, which began in 1977 and
continued into the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Fears also remained that Usu could spew a deadly mix of gas and
rocks -- called a pyroclastic flow -- that races down slopes and
incinerates everything in its path.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said that evacuees might have to
stay for a while at makeshift centers set up in school gyms and
community halls. The government will consider building temporary
housing if that is the case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the centers, families sat on blankets spread out to mark
their private space. Some put up cardboard partitions, but there
was little else to give them any sense of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   About 51,000 people live in the coastal city of Date --
pronounced Dah-tay -- and several smaller towns near Usu, located
475 miles north of Tokyo. Experts had predicted the eruption
because of increased seismic activity that began earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   In Date, the eruption under clear blue skies became more of a
public spectacle than a threat. The somewhat relaxed atmosphere was
understandable: After days of small but constant earthquakes and
high-level warnings, many residents were ready.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the eruption, volcanic ash began to
rain down on nearby towns. Residents downwind were soon enveloped
by the pungent smell of sulfur.
</P>
<P>
   While Date was spared ashfall by winds that blew debris from the
eruption in the opposite direction, other places were not so lucky.
Cars coming in from other areas around the mountain were covered in
dust. Two other towns near Mount Usu, Abuta and Sobetsu, were
silent and empty, nearly all their residents evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Some area residents expressed a mixture of relief and anxiety
after the long-awaited eruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy I'm safe, but I'm afraid this will do huge damage to
my business,'' said 53-year-old scallop cultivator Yomiko Yasuko,
who was out at sea when the volcano erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most eruption-prone countries, with
86 active volcanoes.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Clears Russia Oil Loans  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department lifted its objections
Friday to loans that would help Russia's oil industry, clearing the
way for $500 million in funds to buy equipment from American
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeline Albright decision Friday came after
an ''extensive and deliberative process to ascertain the facts and
assess how circumstances were changing,'' since she imposed the ban
Dec. 21, said State Department spokesman James P. Foley.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to halt U.S. Export-Import Bank guarantees of loans
to Russia's Tyumen Oil Co. came made amid heavy fighting in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But Foley dismissed as coincidence the fact that Albright acted
just days after Vladamir Putin was elected Russia's new president.
Putin has pledged to bring order to the country and wants to create
a favorable climate for foreign and domestic investment.
</P>
<P>
   In December, administration officials denied that her decision
was related to strong U.S. objections to Russian military action
against Chechen rebels, although members of Congress and
presidential candidates had pushed for a halt to such loans at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also had called for the bank to stop the loans because
of reports that the oil company forced a business with partial
American ownership into bankruptcy to obtain the giant Samotlor oil
field in western Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said Albright's action to block the loans had a tonic
effect, noting that Tyumen, then partially owned by the Russian
government, has since been successfully privatized. He said the
company, known as TNK, has begun negotiating with shareholders and
creditors of bankrupt companies involved in the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, TNK president Simon Kukes said the decision would
create thousands of American and Russian jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Broadly speaking, these projects will also help integrate
Russia even further into the world economy,'' Kukes said. The loans
are to be used for upgrading Tyumen's refinery near Moscow and for
rehabilitating the Siberian oil field.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said the United States has ''opened a dialogue with Russia
to impress on them the need to address weaknesses in their legal
system that led to abuses in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the decision on Tyumen doesn't mean that all
concerns about the protection of investor and creditor rights in
Russia have been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's obviously a work in progress,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   The loans would be extended by private banks, with Ex-Im
guarantees. Proceeds would go to Halliburton Co. of Dallas and 24
other U.S. companies in payment for U.S-made oil and gas equipment
and services to be purchased by the Russians.

<HEADLINE> USA Today Redesigning Paper  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- USA Today will have a new look on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were described by the editor, Karen Jurgensen, in a
front-page story on Friday. They include the adoption of a new,
easier-to-read typeface and using a ''more consistent typographical
approach,'' such as putting all headlines in the same typeface.
</P>
<P>
   Jurgensen said the revamp was necessary in order to adapt the
newspaper to a new size that is 1\ inches narrower and a half-inch
longer, a format readers have found to be more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the time required to adjust the newspaper's 36
printing presses throughout the world, some readers will see the
narrower format on the current paper size. The transition is
expected to take about six months.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Curley, president and publisher of USA Today, said that
considerations of cost as well as style were behind the decision.
The smaller format will require about 7 percent less newsprint, the
largest cost behind putting out a newspaper. But Curley also said
the paper's managers wanted the paper to have a different feel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to tone down the graphics a bit,'' Curley said in
an interview. ''We feel that we have been shouting and that too
many people have been shouting to get attention, so we're making a
conscious effort to tone down.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the new typeface is more narrow, the paper will actually
be able to publish slightly more stories under the new format, even
though the size of the format is smaller. ''What we set out to do
was to make sure that the reader wouldn't lose any content,''
Curley said.
</P>
<P>
   Other newspapers have also gravitated toward using narrower
formats, such as the one used by the Washington Post. Last fall The
Fayetteville Observer of North Carolina moved to a narrower format,
and The Plain Dealer of Cleveland made the move a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today is the flagship of Gannett Co., the nation's largest
newspaper company.

<HEADLINE> Workers Encouraged To Nap on Job  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Craig Yarde doesn't mind if his employees
sleep on the job.
</P>
<P>
   In fact Yarde, president of Yarde Metals Inc., is encouraging
workers at his Bristol headquarters to take a midday snooze Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing a lawn chair or blanket of their own, employees will
get an eye mask to block out the light and a turkey sandwich, whose
ingredients have long been believed to bring on sleep.
</P>
<P>
   To help, fiddlers and guitarists will play soothing music.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to start off real mild and mellow,'' Yarde said,
then ''jazz it up'' at the end of the session so workers can head
back to work.
</P>
<P>
   The event is part of the first National Workplace Napping Day,
started by a Reading, Mass., couple who wrote two napping guides
and believe the breaks boost productivity and employee morale.
</P>
<P>
   ''The nap is just wonderful for any employee who feels that
tired, draggy feeling in the beginning of the afternoon,'' said
Camille Anthony, who co-wrote the 1999 book, ''The Art of Napping
at Work,'' with her husband, Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bill, executive director of the Psychiatric Rehabilitation
Center at Boston University, also wrote the 1997 tome, ''The Art of
Napping.''
</P>
<P>
   At least six companies across the nation and a group of students
at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., have
signed on with the event, Camille Anthony said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're trying to do is show ... it makes good sense for
companies, if they have employees who want to nap, to let them,''
said Anthony, who became a devotee of the power of naps while
working for a public relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the program's intent is to chip away at the negative
perception that taking a midday break equates with laziness,
Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not as if napping isn't already going on. People go to
the parking lot, to the bathroom,'' she said. ''If you want to
increase productivity, encourage employees to take a 10- to
30-minute nap. It'll be like having two work days.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarde, whose metal distribution and processing company has 400
employees in eight branches across the Northeast, said he expects
about 100 workers in Bristol to take part. It didn't take much
convincing for him to support the event.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a strong believer in employee perks, next month
planning to break ground on a facility in Pelham, N.H., which will
include kennels for workers' dogs, a coffee-roasting room, gym and
children's play area. He hopes to open a similar facility by year's
end in Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   ''Associate loyalty is priceless,'' he said. ''The customer side
is important, but if we can motivate the associates here ... we can
still make money and everybody's happy and motivated.''

<HEADLINE> Leonardo DiCaprio Interviews Clinton  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Friday was no day at ''The Beach'' for
Leonardo DiCaprio -- it was a day at the White House, interviewing
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old actor, whose latest role was that of an amoral
backpacker in search of the perfect beach, assumed the role of
journalist for ABC to interview President Clinton about the
environment. The interview is to air April 22 on for an Earth Day
special.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton talked about his policy on global warming and efforts to
make the White House more environmentally friendly, said White
House spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, DiCaprio walked out of the Oval Office with the
president and waved goodbye as Clinton climbed into his limousine
and headed for a local golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Beach'' created a stir among environmentalists while being
filmed in Thailand. The moviemakers stripped away native grasses,
cleared out garbage and bulldozed Maya Bay beach to make it look a
little more ''perfect.'' They also promised to restore the beach to
its original condition.

<HEADLINE> Chiapas Bishop Honors Predecessor  </HEADLINE>
By ALEJANDRO RUIZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- The newly appointed
bishop for this conflict-ridden region of Mexico's Chiapas state
said Friday he would not challenge the work of his controversial
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am conscious of the fact that I'm not going to San Cristobal
de las Casas to compete with or destroy, but to complement,''
Felipe Arizmendi Ezquivel said of retiring Bishop Samuel Ruiz
Garcia. ''I value the illustrious 40-year episcopal commitment of
Monsignor Samuel Ruiz.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Pope John Paul II named Arizmendi to succeed
Ruiz, 75.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz became known among supporters as the ''bishop of the poor''
for his work with poverty-stricken and exploited Indian peasants.
But the government and conservatives harshly criticized Ruiz,
linking him with Zapatista rebels and dubbing him the ''red
bishop'' for what they considered to be his socialist views.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas staged a brief uprising in Chiapas in January
1994 to demand democracy and Indian rights. Peace talks are
stalemated.
</P>
<P>
   Arizmendi, who is currently the bishop of Tapachula on the
Chiapas coast, is known as a moderate with some conservative
positions. He has sharply criticized the Zapatista National
Liberation Army for choosing to wage an armed rebellion.
Nonetheless, he also has supported Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz expressed his confidence that Arizmendi would continue his
pastoral work in the indigenous communities, saying he is a bishop
committed to the peace process. Arizmendi will assume his new
duties May 1, Ruiz said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Executives To Visit Havana  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Dozens of representatives of American firms are
planning to visit the communist island as part of a U.S.-Cuba
Business Summit, organizers announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The business executives will meet with Cuban cabinet-level
ministers in Cancun, Mexico, on June 7 and 8, then fly to Havana to
meet with representatives of state-owned businesses and more
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Cristobal, an Italian firm with offices in Havana, organized the
event at the request of Alamar Associates, a Washington-based
consulting firm that had set up three previous summits. Alamar said
the U.S. government has refused it permission to hold the gathering
in communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Under the U.S. embargo against Cuba in place for nearly four
decades, the Treasury Department regulates spending on the island
by American firms and individuals.

<HEADLINE> Branch Davidian Trial Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal judge presiding over the Branch
Davidians' wrongful-death lawsuit against the government on Friday
delayed the trial's start by a month, saying court-appointed
experts need more time to analyze results from a re-enactment of
the siege's deadly end.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith of Waco, Texas, moved the start
date from May 15 to June 19.
</P>
<P>
   Vector Data Systems, the court-appointed expert examining
results from the re-enactment, won't have its report ready until
May 8 at the earliest, Smith said. The analysis initially had been
expected by mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   The trial delay elicited no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think all parties agree that a few more weeks were necessary
in order to complete discovery and to respond if necessary to the
Vector report when that comes out,'' said Michael Bradford, the
U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas who is one of the
government's lead lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   James Brannon, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs, agreed the
delay makes little difference, particularly since the deadline to
interview most witnesses was reached Friday. ''It doesn't matter if
it's May 15th or June 19th,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vector experts are examining results from a field test
designed to determine the answer to a question at the heart of the
Davidians' lawsuit, congressional inquiries and the investigation
by the Waco special counsel: Did government agents fire shots at
the end of the siege?
</P>
<P>
   During the March 19 demonstration, weapons similar to those
carried by Branch Davidians and federal agents were fired while
infrared cameras mounted on two aircraft recorded the action.
Experts for the court, the government and the plaintiffs are
comparing that test footage to aerial infrared videos recorded by
the FBI during the actual encounter on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend rapid-fire bursts of light captured on
the FBI's 1993 recordings represent gunfire from government
positions into the Branch Davidians' burning building in the last
hour of the 51-day siege.
</P>
<P>
   The government insists its agents, who were being shot at by the
sect members, did not return fire. Federal officials maintain the
sect members engineered their own deaths.

<HEADLINE> Spain's Almodovar Blase About Oscar  </HEADLINE>
by DANIEL WOOLLS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Now that Spanish film director Pedro
Almodovar has won an Oscar, he'd like people to stop talking about
it and get on with their lives. He certainly plans to.
</P>
<P>
   Winning Hollywood's top honor was great, he told a sea of
reporters Friday. So was rubbing elbows with stars and being
treated like a king.
</P>
<P>
   But Almodovar wants to get back to writing and directing cinema
-- he has three screenplays in the works -- and also to the pleasures
of doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   After a heady year watching his film ''All About My Mother''
(Todo Sobre Mi Madre) land a number of prizes, culminating in
Sunday's Oscar for best foreign film, Almodovar wants to relax a
bit. He wants to watch TV, or see friends, or take in somebody
else's flick.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, though, he wants other Spaniards to cut out
all the chatter about him, his movie and his statuette.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like very much for the whole subject of 'Todo Sobre mi
Madre' and the Oscar to be put to rest, ideally right after this
press conference, because there is nothing left to say,'' Almodovar
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''I was nominated for an Oscar. I won. It was
marvelous. But there's not much else to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar, 48, declined to reveal anything about his next movie,
saying he himself did not know which of his three unfinished
screenplays would make it onto the screen first.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that for the time being he has no interest in
making movies in Hollywood, and fired off a barb at the Oscar
ceremony organizers.
</P>
<P>
   He said they treated him disrespectfully by rushing him off
stage when his acceptance speech, pronounced in heavily accented
English and with odd references to saints and virgins, ran
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's simple. They cut me off,'' Almodovar said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ceremony is geared mainly toward Americans watching it in
on television,'' he said. ''Naturally, the awards for best
short-length movie, documentary or foreign film don't matter much
to them.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-con Sentenced in Racer's Murder  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE RUSHLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- A man was sentenced to two life terms without
parole Friday for the murder of a championship power boat racer
whose body was found in the New Mexico desert four months after he
and his airplane vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Joe Keesee, 65, admitted in U.S. District Court that he
shot Harry M. Christensen, who also owned a custom boat business.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a possible death sentence, Keesee pleaded guilty in
November to a number of felonies including air piracy, interference
with commerce and murder using a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and police were baffled for months as they searched for
Christensen's missing body, even after they arrested Keesee.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen's blood-soaked twin-engine Cessna 340 was found at
Coronado Airport in Albuquerque, N.M., the day after the
48-year-old businessman disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until four months later that a rancher stumbled
across the body in a remote desert stretch in Sandoval County, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Keesee met Christensen by responding to an advertisement for
Christensen's plane in January 1999. Christensen met with Keesee
twice, once allowing him to fly the plane, before he said he wanted
to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   They met at the Lake Havasu airport on Jan. 6, 1999, where
Christensen was shot in the chest and the head, authorities say.
Keesee shoved the body into the plane's cabin and took off.
</P>
<P>
   He used Christensen's credit cards to refuel the plane in
Winslow before flying to Albuquerque. Once there, authorities say
he borrowed a friend's van and drove Christensen's body to the
remote desert spot where he dumped it.
</P>
<P>
   Keesee was arrested the next day with Christensen's rings, Rolex
watch and credit cards but refused to tell authorities where
Christensen was.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen was a well-known figure in the boat-racing world. He
and his son, Jeff, won the Pacific Offshore Powerboat Racing
Association season points title in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Keesee has a long criminal history, with his first conviction
dating back to 1962.
</P>
<P>
   He twice served time for posing as a federal official in schemes
to obtain airplanes. He also served prison time for attempting to
bilk a company in a purchasing scam, for theft of a plane and for
conspiracy in the death of a U.S. consul in Hermosillo, Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Civilian Control for Engineers Corps  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is making management changes in
the embattled Army Corps of Engineers aimed at restoring civilian
control and increasing accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Army Secretary Louis Caldera announced the changes, which
followed allegations that top Corps officers doctored data to
justify the $1 billion cost of lengthening seven locks on the
Mississippi and Illinois rivers. Internal documents that a Corps
whistle-blower included with an affidavit alleging the impropriety
suggested the agency is intent on enlarging its construction
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps' $4 billion civil works program has been officially
under the Army assistant secretary since the 1980s, but Pentagon
control over Corps decision-making has deteriorated over the years,
Army spokesman Jim Stueve said.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera said effective immediately all final decisions on Corps
project recommendations will be by Joseph Westphal, the Army's
assistant secretary for civil works. Corps military leaders also
are banned from lobbying Congress on their own, and Caldera shifted
responsibility for evaluating top Corps officials to Westphal from
the Corps' military commander, Lt. Gen. Joe Ballard.
</P>
<P>
   ''My purpose in making these changes is to support the Corps of
Engineers ... and to ensure that decisions are timely, objective,
fair and deserving of the full confidence of the American public,''
Caldera said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen sent a letter to ''strongly
endorse'' Caldera's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional Republicans say Caldera's move was
unnecessary and could hamstring the Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ''My only concern is that civilian oversight ... could lead to a
little more politicizing of the issues,'' said Rep. John Shimkus,
R-Ill. ''I would hate to see us move rapidly until the full details
come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, who believe increased barge traffic and
construction would seriously damage the Upper Mississippi River
ecosystem, say the changes do not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Faber, with Washington-based American Rivers, said the way
the Corps studies proposed projects should be fairer and more
environmentally conscious. He suggested requiring regular
independent reviews of cost-benefit analyses and a ban on projects
where the cost of mitigating for environmental damage is too high.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our concern is that the assistant secretary won't use his new
authority to reform the agency,'' Faber said. ''These are things he
could do tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related move, Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, asked the
General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, to examine
the restoration projects on the Mississippi River and the
Everglades in Florida. He wants to see whether ''the objectivity
and standards of the Corps of Engineers are being compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We must be able to continue to rely on the Corps of Engineers
to only recommend to the Congress those projects which make maximum
net positive contributions to economic development and
environmental quality,'' said Voinovich, chairman of the Senate
Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations by Corps economist Donald Sweeney that started
the controversy prompted the federal Office of Special Counsel to
conclude the Corps probably violated the law and to order a full
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Caldera asked for a review by the Army inspector
general and the National Academy of Sciences and requested the
management study that yielded this week's changes.

<HEADLINE> US Joins More Oil, Gas Royalty Suits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department joined lawsuits Friday
accusing Exxon-Mobil, Shell Oil Co., and Burlington Resources Inc.,
of intentionally underpaying royalties on oil and gas they took
from leased federal and Indian land.
</P>
<P>
   The original lawsuits were brought in U.S. District Court in
Lufkin, Texas, by private whistleblowers under the False Claims
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, the department has intervened in similar lawsuits
against seven oil companies. To date, the government has obtained
more than $170 million in settlements of these oil royalty
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Private oil and gas companies obtain mineral leases from the
Interior Department giving them the right to extract oil and gas
from federal and Indian land in return for paying royalties. The
False Claims Act allows the government to collect three times the
account of unpaid royalties plus $5,000 to $10,000 for each
underpayment. The act allows private whistleblowers to sue over
these underpayments and to receive a portion, based on the value of
their legal work, of whatever the government recovers.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Shy Away From Biotech Crops  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers are turning away from genetically
engineered crops, especially a biotech corn that's toxic to
insects, amid consumer resistance that started overseas and is now
being felt in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Plantings of the gene-altered corn are projected to drop 24
percent this year, according to findings of an Agriculture
Department survey released Friday. The report also suggested
declines in biotech varieties of cotton and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to go out here and spend any more money ... than
we absolutely have to,'' said Allan Morris, who farms near Mason,
Ill. ''We can't afford to do that with the margins we have in
agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   Biotech crops had caught on quickly in the late 1990s despite
the relatively high cost of the seed.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans were the first to balk at buying biotech grain, which
wary Britons have dubbed ''Frankenfoods,'' but there is also
resistance in Asia, and a handful of U.S. companies now are turning
them down, including baby food makers and snack-food giant
Frito-Lay Inc. U.S. regulators insist that the biotech crops are no
different from conventional versions.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech corn, known as Bt corn for a bacteria gene that it
contains, became especially controversial last year after a Cornell
University study suggested it could be killing Monarch butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   According to the USDA survey, farmers in major corn-producing
states intend to plant 19 percent of their corn acreage this year
to the Bt variety, down from 25 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Plantings of biotech cotton are projected to decline from 55
percent last year to 48 percent in 2000. Some 52 percent of this
year's soybean acreage is expected to be a biotech variety that is
resistant to a popular herbicide. About 57 percent of soybeans last
year were herbicide resistant, including a small amount that was
conventionally bred.
</P>
<P>
   ''Producers are just trying to protect themselves. The industry
seems to be saying they want less biotech and that's what their
interest is, going to where the industry is telling them to go,''
said Don Roose, an analyst with U.S. Commodities Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Farm groups had expected the reduction in biotech corn because
of resistance to the crop in overseas markets and a decline in
infestations of the European corn borer, the pest the corn is
designed to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Farmers need markets. They always say the consumer is king,
and the consumer in this case isn't that interested in genetically
engineered corn,'' said Margaret Mellon of the Union of Concerned
Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Seed companies have insisted that demand for biotech varieties
is in line with last year, although some have been offering
discounts to farmers to maintain sales. Monsanto Co.'s biotech
sales are ''flat to marginally better'' than last year, said
spokesman Dan Verakis.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Dittrich, who farms near Tilden, Neb., planted at least 75
percent of his corn and soybean acreage to biotech varieties last
year and isn't cutting back. They save work and reduce the need for
insecticides and herbicides, he said. ''I haven't seen any proof
that it's not safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Morris, the Illinois farmer, planted Bt seed on just 10
percent of his corn acreage in 1999 and said he's going to grow
even less this year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, farmers plan to plant an estimated 77.9 million acres
of corn this year, up 1 percent from 1999, and a record 74.9
million acres of soybeans, also a 1 percent increase, according to
the USDA survey.
</P>
<P>
   Total cotton plantings are expected to reach 15.6 million acres
this year, an increase of 5 percent from last year, and the
second-largest acreage since 1962. Sugarbeet acreage is expected to
rise by 1 percent to 1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat acreage is expected to total 61.7 million acres, down 2
percent from 1999, reflecting a shift to crops that producers
consider more lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans have become increasingly popular with farmers in recent
years because of federal price supports that make the crop more
profitable than some other commodities, according to analysts.

<HEADLINE> Income, Spending Both Rose in Feb.  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American consumers, the driving force behind
the supercharged economy, spent with abandon in February at a pace
more than double their income growth. It dragged the personal
savings rate to a record low.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said Friday's report shows that the Federal Reserve
has not finished raising interest rates to slow the economy and
keep inflation from becoming a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing their buying binge, Americans increased their
spending 1 percent last month, the fastest pace since December, the
Commerce Department said.
</P>
<P>
   People are feeling wealthy and in the mood to spend because jobs
are plentiful, incomes are rising, the stock market is strong and
inflation is low, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers are buying anything and everything they can get
their hands on,'' said economist Mark Zandi of RFA Dismal Sciences.
''There's no significant constraint on consumer spending at this
point in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Americans' personal income, which includes wages,
interest and government benefits, increased by just 0.4 percent
last month, the slowest pace since December.
</P>
<P>
   With spending outpacing income growth, the rate of personal
savings, or savings as a percentage of after-tax income, fell to
0.8 percent in February, a record monthly low. In January, the rate
was 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the savings rate isn't as dire as it would seem, economists
said. The savings rate measures only the amount of money being put
aside each month for savings.
</P>
<P>
   It does not represent a calculation of personal wealth, which
would account for gains households have realized on their savings
in previous months from such as rising stock market values and
higher real estate values for their homes. Thus, the savings rate
reflects money socked into a 401(k) but it doesn't capture an
increase or decrease in its value.
</P>
<P>
   The rising value of investments with the booming stock market
has contributed to the low national savings rate because consumers
feel more confident that they can afford to save less and spend
more because their investments are doing well.
</P>
<P>
   However, economists caution that the economy could be in for a
shock if the stock market suddenly were to plunge and trigger a
sharp cutback in consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds
of total economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average gave up solid
early gains to close down 58.33 points to 10,921.92. But the Nasdaq
finished the day higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve boosted interest rates last week for a fifth
time since June 30 to slow the speeding economy, which grew at a
breakneck 7.3 percent rate in the final three months of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the higher rates made borrowing more expensive for
consumers and businesses, they haven't yet significantly slowed the
economy or its main engine, consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, many economists believe the central bank will bump
up rates again on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the type of report that has to truly worry (Fed)
members as there are no signs that the 'Shop till you drop, and
then pick yourself up so you can shop some more' philosophy has
changed at all,'' said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic
Advisors. ''This economy is still red-hot, and the Fed is going to
do more, maybe a lot more, to cool the flames.''
</P>
<P>
   Stan Shipley, economist for Merrill Lynch, estimated that the
economy is growing at a 5.5 percent rate in the current quarter,
slower than the previous quarter but still much faster than what
the Fed believes is prudent.
</P>
<P>
   Most consumer spending last month was on durable goods,
big-ticket items expected to last at least three years, such as
cars, which rose 1.5 percent. Spending on nondurable goods, such as
food and fuel, grew by 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The report also showed that Americans' wages grew by 0.3 percent
in February, while farm proprietors' income rose by 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In January, total income grew by 0.7 percent, while total
spending increased by 0.6 percent, slightly higher than the
government previously reported. It was the first time since October
that income rose faster than spending.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, orders to U.S. factories were down for the
second month in a row, falling a smaller-than-expected 0.8 percent
in February. But economists said it's too early to view this as a
sign of a slowdown in the economy. Orders for airplanes and other
transportation equipment led the decline with a 8.9 percent plunge,
the steepest drop in 10 months.

<HEADLINE> Xerox To Eliminate 5,200 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Business machines giant Xerox Corp.,
struggling to compete in both the large and small office markets,
plans to slash 5,200 jobs, close manufacturing plants and take a
$625 million charge against earnings in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts represent 5.5 percent of the company's worldwide
work force of 94,600.
</P>
<P>
   ''While these are difficult actions for our people, Xerox can no
longer operate business as usual and expect to win,'' said Rick
Thoman, the Xerox president and chief executive. ''We're
intensifying our drive to become a faster, leaner and more flexible
enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Thoman said the marketplace has changed from the days when the
company was a leader in photocopying technology.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox said the cutbacks will help the company focus on its two
core markets: business machines such as copiers for home and
medium-sized offices, and larger systems that enable big companies
to organize and share information in the form of digital documents.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement had been expected for months. Xerox said in
January that an overhaul was coming, and analysts this week had
predicted deep job cuts and a restructuring charge of as much as
$900 million.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were praised by analysts, who said Xerox needs to make
the cuts to compete with Hewlett-Packard and Canon. But Xerox stock
dropped 2 percent Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, falling
56\ cents to close at $26 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are going to try their best to compete in any way
possible, not just by cutting but also by announcing new
products,'' said Marjorie Saint-Aime, an analyst with brokerage
firm Pittsburg Institutional Inc. ''They are going in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Runkle, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said
the company is making the right moves, but may need to go further.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the key here is that the company needs to recreate an
infrastructure that is more efficient, lower-cost and (one) that
generates higher returns, which goes far beyond just taking out
some general and administrative costs,'' Runkle said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Friday was the company's fourth major
restructuring in the last decade. In 1998, the company took a $1.1
billion charge and cut about 9,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox said none of the cuts in the latest overhaul will affect
its sales force or research and development efforts. The company's
struggle to realign its sales force along industry lines rather
than geographical boundaries has been blamed in part for its
disappointing performance in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The company's profits fell 52 percent in the fourth quarter,
with revenue down 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said it expects to see another decline in
earnings in the first quarter, which ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The $625 million charge includes about $175 million for closing
facilities and scrapping some of the company's inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox spokesman Jeff Simek said some manufacturing plants will
be closed, along with some warehouse and distribution facilities.
Simek would not say where plants will be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox said the job cuts would affect all work levels and
geographic areas, with more than half coming from offices in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts will hit especially hard at Rochester, N.Y., the
company's manufacturing hub. Xerox said about 2,000 out of 14,650
jobs in the Rochester region will be eliminated. The company's
cross-town rival, Eastman Kodak Co., has eliminated 6,300 jobs in
Rochester over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Simek said jobs will be eliminated across the board, but the
hardest-hit ranks will be U.S. upper- and middle-management, which
will be cut by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the company's headquarters were reluctant to talk
about the job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, who would not give her name, said the cutbacks would
be good for the company in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know we're going to have some cuts, but it's very important
for us (as a company),'' she said. ''I know we're going to do
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Xerox, traditionally a high-end copier company, in the last few
years has made a move to become a major player in the home office
and small business environment, through low-end retail channels
such as Staples and Office Max.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the company announced it would buy the color
printing division of Tektronix Inc. for $950 million in a deal that
will make Xerox second only to Hewlett-Packard in the office color
printing market.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox also announced a $2 billion alliance with Sharp and Fuji
Xerox to develop and manufacture inkjet products for small and home
offices.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans, Gold, Silver Rise  </HEADLINE>
By HERBERT G. McCANN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were higher Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, with weather worries influencing trading in
the market.
</P>
<P>
   The market also received support from the release before the
start of trading of the U.S. Agriculture Department's quarterly
stock report and planting estimates.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, gold and silver futures recovered some of the
week's losses and sugar futures prices were higher.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean futures rose to close at their highest price in nearly a
year. The market was bolstered by forecasts of dry weather into the
middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Also boosting soybean prices was USDA data showing soybean
stocks totaled 1.39 billion bushels, lower than analysts estimates
of 1.4 billion bushels. However, the government also estimated
soybean planting would total 74.87 million acres, an increase from
last year's 73.78 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Joe Victor of Allendale Inc. noted that farmers usually
plant anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million more acres than the
government's initial estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat futures prices were boosted by worries about possible
freeze damage next week to the hard red winter wheat crop, with
cold weather forecast for parts of the Great Plains.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA reports wheat stocks total 1.4 billion bushels as of
March 1 -- Analysts say that is smaller than the market expected.
The USDA also estimates 14.8 million acres of wheat will be planted
this year, down from last year's 15.3 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   Corn futures prices were higher despite weather forecasts
calling for weekend rain in crop-producing areas of the Midwest.
The USDA's acreage and quarterly stock data for corn was considered
neutral, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated 77.8 million acres of corn will be planted this
year, only slightly above last year's 77.4 million acres. The USDA
placed corn stocks at 5.6 million bushels.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery was 6} cents higher at $2.62\ a bushel;
May corn was 2} cents higher at $2.36 a bushel; May oats were 1\
cents higher at $1.22\ a bushel; May soybeans were 8 cents higher
at 5.45{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Gold futures prices were higher in trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, with the modest gains attributed to the
weakness of the U.S dollar against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   Silver gained as investors viewed the metal a bargain after its
price dropped below $5.
</P>
<P>
   Gold and silver prices were hurt earlier in the week by the
renewed strength of the stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   June gold was $2.30 higher at $281.40 a troy ounce, May silver
was 6.2 cents higher at $5.045 a troy ounce.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar futures prices, driven by commodity fund buying, moved
higher in trading on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Demand from several Asian nations gave a lift to the market, as
did ideas world supplies will shrink as several producing nations
cutback acreage.
</P>
<P>
   May sugar was .35 cent higher at 5.90 cents a pound.

yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC said Drkoop.com has sustained losses and
negative cash flows from operations since its inception. And the

   OPEC Said To Seek $22-$28 Oil Price

   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- OPEC plans to increase oil output
whenever the price of the cartel's crude basket exceeds $28 a

Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez said today. Rodriguez, the new president
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said the
price-band plan was approved by OPEC members during their meeting
earlier this week in Vienna, Austria. The system, which will allow
quick supply changes to keep oil prices within a set range, had

   Widespread Rail Track Defects Found
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- CSX Transportation announced an internal
review of its track maintenance today after federal railroad
inspectors found deteriorating conditions in its system used by
passenger, freight and commuter trains up and down the East Coast.
The Federal Railroad Administration had begun a special safety
audit of the railroad in February after a series of derailments.
George Gavalla, associate administrator for safety, said the agency
audited CSX in 1997 and became concerned because it hadn't seen a
reduction in derailments and other problems. John W. Snow, chairman
and chief executive officer of CSX Corporation, responded that his
company ''has repaired or is in the process of repairing all of the
defects identified in the report. The company said Snow will
personally head an internal company review of all track maintenance
and improvement programs.

the cheap-yet-chic clothes from the popular Swedish chain. From
curious New Yorkers to European tourists, they piled into H&AMP;M's
store on tony Fifth Avenue, combing through the racks filled with
fashionable $9 shirts and $20 pairs of pants. The enthusiastic
crowd offered a temporary distraction from troubles that beset H&AMP;M
last week, when its chief executive quit and the company reported a
12 percent drop in projected quarterly profits. Stockholm-based H&AMP;M

African countries. The certification process began this week, but
an unrelated legal dispute means De Beers isn't selling diamonds
from any source in Angola for the time being. The United Nations

   Farmers To Cut Biotech Plantings
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers are turning away from genetically
engineered crops, especially a biotech corn that's toxic to
insects, amid consumer resistance that started overseas and is now
being felt in the United States. Plantings of the gene-altered corn
are projected to drop 24 percent this year, according to findings
of an Agriculture Department survey released today. The report also
suggested declines in biotech varieties of cotton and soybeans.
''We don't want to go out here and spend any more money ... than we
absolutely have to,'' said Allan Morris, who farms near Mason, Ill.
Biotech crops had caught on quickly in the late 1990s despite the
relatively high cost of the seed.

<HEADLINE> Gore Has Political Conversions  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore is moving to please voter
constituencies he'll need to win the presidency, whether that means
breaking with the White House over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez or
shifting positions to court homosexuals, labor groups, blacks and
women.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Republican George W. Bush challenged his Democratic
rival to prove he's ''not playing Florida politics'' in the case of
the Cuban boy caught at the center of a U.S.-Cuba custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts are divided over whether the vice president's
conversions weaken his credibility or help him establish his own
identity apart from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it says more about his chutzpah than his character,''
said Bob Zelnick, a former TV reporter who wrote a biography of the
vice president titled, ''Gore: A Political Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For seven years he was the man in the blue suit and red tie,
crowding into every photo op. Now he wears different suits and acts
like it's an alien administration,'' Zelnick said.
</P>
<P>
   Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University in
Atlanta, thinks the Gonzalez case in particular shows that Gore is
a cunning candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what he's trying to do is show he's a bold leader and
he will do what he thinks is right, which to him may have the happy
result of winning votes or at least neutralizing the opposition of
others,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gore broke with the administration by saying that
he supported legislation that would grant Elian Gonzalez and his
Cuban relatives permanent U.S. residency. He also wants the case
heard in a family court, not decided by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The administration argues that Elian should be taken from his
Miami relatives and reunited with his Cuban father. That position
has enraged Cuban Americans in South Florida -- and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the vice president is serious and not playing Florida
politics, he ought to stand up and say to the attorney general,
'You've got the power to back the INS off so that the fate of this
young man will not be determined by bureaucratic decree,''' Bush
told reporters while campaigning in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   With 25 electoral votes, Florida is the fourth-biggest prize in
November's general election. The state generally votes Republican
in presidential elections, but Clinton won it in a three-way race
in 1996, gaining 40 percent of the Cuban-American vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who runs strong among Florida's seniors, hopes to win
enough of the Cuban-American vote as well to threaten Bush with a
loss in a state that's run by his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the governor of Texas, gets indignant when asked about
Gore's changing positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This man will say anything to get elected,'' is his constant
refrain.
</P>
<P>
   That echos the sentiments of Bill Bradley during the Democratic
primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''He claims these issues are priorities for him,'' Bradley said
of Gore in February, after he accused his rival of trying to co-opt
his positions. ''But priorities come from convictions, not through
polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Some examples of the vice president's shifts:
</P>
<P>
   --During a January debate, Gore courted homosexuals by saying he
would require that his appointees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff
agree that gays be allowed to serve openly in the military. When
that triggered criticism, Gore backpedaled, saying, ''I did not
mean to imply that there should ever be any kind of inquiry into
the personal political opinions of officers in the U.S. military.''
</P>
<P>
   --Meeting privately with AFL-CIO officials in mid-February, Gore
reportedly told the union bosses that, if elected, he could
negotiate a better trade deal with the Chinese than the
administration on the issues of environmental and working
conditions. When a business group complained to the White House,
Gore issued a statement saying he stood behind the administration's
landmark agreement to permit China enter the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   --Speaking to Jewish leaders in New York in early March, Gore
hinted he would support moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem, despite Palestinian opposition. ''My desires are
the same as your desires,'' he said. Gore also has met with Al
Sharpton, a black leader in the state.
</P>
<P>
   --Several days later, Gore bid for supporters of former
presidential candidate John McCain by pledging to make the Arizona
senator's signature issue -- campaign finance reform -- his own
political centerpiece. The vice president said he had learned from
the ''mistakes'' he made raising money during the 1996 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   --Last fall, Gore even moved his campaign headquarters from
Washington to Nashville, Tenn., after Bradley posed serious
competition. The vice president also swapped his conservative
business suits for a new look of earth-toned sports coats and
slacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has greeted Gore's campaign moves
with understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gore broke with Clinton on the Gonzalez case, White
House spokesman Jake Siewert said the president was not angry. Such
differences, Siewert said, should be expected as Gore's campaign
unfolds. ''His office spoke to the chief of staff's office,''
Siewert said, ''and we let the president know.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said the Gonzalez decision ''was a
tough political call,'' but it was consistent with the vice
president's long-held belief that the case should be resolved in
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll make his stands when he thinks it's the right thing to
do, whether or not it pleases everybody,'' Hattaway said. ''I don't
buy this line of argument from political opponents.''

<HEADLINE> Philly Mob Hit by Indictments  </HEADLINE>
By RON TODT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia mob, reeling from years of
infighting and prosecutions, was dealt another blow with the
indictment of its reputed boss and 10 others on charges of murder,
racketeering, extortion and gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is a mob operating in Philadelphia, it's on its last
legs,'' said Fred Martens, former executive director of the
now-defunct Pennsylvania Crime Commission. ''The federal government
has decimated the mob in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Joseph ''Skinny Joey'' Merlino and 10 others
was aided by jailed former mob boss Ralph Natale, who has been
cooperating with authorities since the summer. Natale, the
highest-ranking American Mafia figure to flip sides, allegedly
appointed Merlino as his successor in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot overstate the significance of this case,'' said U.S.
Attorney Michael Stiles, who announced the indictment Friday. ''Not
only does it reach to the highest levels of organized crime,
significant evidence comes from the highest levels of organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''That in my judgment represents a complete collapse of this
criminal organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are accused of three murders and an attempted
murder. They also allegedly operated a protection racket that
preyed on bookmakers, numbers operators, video poker machine
operators and others in Philadelphia and southern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino already is jailed on drug charges. Of the others, eight
were arrested Friday, and two were arrested earlier and freed on
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino and three others could face the death penalty if federal
prosecutors decided to seek it, Stiles said.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino attorney Joseph Santaguida said his client denied all
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia mob has declined since the 1960s and 1970s,
when Angelo Bruno ruled with a firm hand. Since Bruno was gunned
down in a car in front of his home in 1980, his successors have
been taken down, one by one, by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, a federal jury convicted then-boss ''Little Nicky''
Scarfo and 16 associates on racketeering charges. John Stanfa took
over in 1990 but was found guilty of racketeering with seven others
in 1995. Natale then took over, appointing Merlino as underboss.

<HEADLINE> NH Judge Resigns Amid Investigation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire Supreme Court Justice Stephen
Thayer, under pressure from state and federal investigations of his
personal finances, resigned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer resigned a month after he was put on leave while
authorities investigated him for failing to disclose a personal
loan.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the FBI said its investigation found no evidence of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But Attorney General Philip McLaughlin said Friday an
investigation by his office resulted in Thayer's resignation.
McLaughlin said he would release a full report of the investigation
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer, 54, a former U.S. attorney, was appointed to the New
Hampshire Supreme Court in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, William Brennan, did not immediately return a phone
call Friday. He said this week the intense attention to Thayer's
actions had been costly.
</P>
<P>
   ''This process has taken its toll, not only on him, but also the
institution he has served for the last 16 years,'' Brennan said.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations arose during Thayer's recent divorce that he had
failed to disclose some of his debts on home loan applications.
Federal banking laws require that all debts be disclosed on
mortgage and loan applications.
</P>
<P>
   Independently, the state's Judicial Conduct Committee is
investigating Thayer's failure to report a $50,000 loan from lawyer
Emile Bussiere on annual financial disclosure forms for judges from
1997 to 1999. Thayer later amended the forms to disclose the loan.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also is looking into Thayer's failure to report
the Bussiere loan on a 1997 bank application for a $55,000 home
equity loan, and whether he omitted other debts from a 1993
mortgage application -- the same allegations investigated by the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer's colleagues on the court placed him on administrative
leave with pay last month, but did not say why. Thayer had been
fighting the suspension in federal court.

<HEADLINE> More Cities Join HUD Gun Safety Plan  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gunmaker Smith &AMP; Wesson's pledge to adopt
landmark safety and responsibility standards is winning it a lot of
business from local government officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks since President Clinton praised the
Springfield, Mass., gunmaker for its stance, a total of 65 cities
and counties have pledged to make Smith &AMP; Wesson their preferred
source for police handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven of those local jurisdictions joined the list
Friday, including Oakland, Calif.; Kansas City, Mo.; Buffalo, N.Y.,
and Richmond Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''Members of this coalition will use their considerable
purchasing power to encourage gun manufacturers to make a safer
products that cannot be accessed by criminals and children,''
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo said at a news
conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo was joined by Washington Mayor Anthony Williams who also
had some good news for the nation's largest handgun maker -- the
city was dropping Smith &AMP; Wesson from a lawsuit against the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a historical breakthrough in the effort to make
our communities safer,'' Williams said, adding that other gunmakers
also ''have an obligation to comply.''
</P>
<P>
   In an agreement that President Clinton announced on March 17,
Smith &AMP; Wesson said it would install gun locks on all the weapons
it sells, introduce within three years ''smart gun'' technology
permitting weapons to be fired only by their owners and bar sales
of its weapons at gun shows without a background check.
</P>
<P>
   The company broke industry ranks and changed its policy in
exchange for a promise that it would be dropped from a lawsuit
being put together by the White House and HUD on behalf of local
public housing authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia in January named Smith &AMP; Wesson as one
of 23 gun manufactures and two gun distributors being sued to
recover Medicaid other governmental health care expenditures
attributed to gunshot injuries, including wounded police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a group of 28 cities and counties -- including Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta, St. Louis, Boston and Florida's
Miami-Dade County -- announced they would give preference in their
handgun purchases to Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said any other gun manufacturer that signs the pledge like
Smith &AMP; Wesson's would get similar preference. Cuomo estimated that
sales to law enforcement agencies make up between 20 to 30 percent
of gunmakers' business.
</P>
<P>
   ''It comes down to an ecomonic preference. If you have a choice
of what product to buy and who to do business with, you would
choose the safer product and the more responsible company,'' Cuomo
said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a new study by UCLA asserting that more than 1.7
million children live in homes where guns are loaded but do not
have safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   ''That shows the need for the product Smith &AMP; Wesson is
developing,'' Cuomo said. Cuomo cited a published report that gun
sales at Smith &AMP; Wesson's six retail stores show sales are up more
than 300 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Rooff, mayor of Waterloo, Iowa, said that while gun
safety is often portrayed as a big city issue, his community of
about 65,000 demanded at a community meeting that more be done to
protect children from guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''People turned out and said what they want is a safer
community,'' Rooff said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Powers, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association,
said Friday that HUD's involvement in the gun issue has taken it
far afield from what it should be doing to make public housing
safer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bad deal,'' Powers said. ''I'd rather see HUD trying to
clean up public housing so criminals can't run things there. Their
focus ... is all wrong.''

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A dumbfounded Superior Court judge asked
two Trinity College students Friday why they participated in a drug
binge that left a classmate dead only months before graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why does a young man with brains, with a future ... what in
the world possessed you and your friends to make this drug cocktail
mixed with alcohol?,'' Judge Howard Scheinblum asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a severe lack of judgment,'' responded William Bachman,
a senior from Natick, Mass., who has been suspended and may not
graduate. ''I wish with all my heart I could take it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Eaves, a senior from Downingtown, Pa., who was expelled
from Trinity, said he and his friends had taken the opportunities
given them for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realize now that is the most horrendous of offenses,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered Bachman to undergo drug and alcohol treatment
and Eaves to participate in drug treatment. He also agreed to allow
the students to make charitable contributions in lieu of community
service.
</P>
<P>
   The students, who were charged with possession of narcotics,
avoided jail time. Their cases were continued while they complete
their programs and if they stay out of trouble for a year, their
records will be wiped clean.
</P>
<P>
   ''These young men could have paid for their actions with their
lives,'' said Trinity spokeswoman Linda Campanella. ''One of their
close friends did. We are very pleased they are alive and that they
will be getting help.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaves and Bachman, both 22, were among four roommates who were
drinking and doing drugs in their dormitory room on March 17.
Authorities said the students apparently had mixed prescription
anti-anxiety drugs, sleeping pills and a migraine medication and
also may have taken heroin.
</P>
<P>
   One of the students, 22-year-old Joshua Doroff of Harrison,
N.Y., died after friends brought him to the Hartford Hospital
emergency room. The other student, Clement ''Nick'' Kaupp III, of
Mendham, N.J., had been in critical condition for several days
after the binge.
</P>
<P>
   Kaupp, 22, is scheduled to appear in court on April 11 on a
charge of possession of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   During Bachman's case, the judge said he would grant the
applications for treatment because the student had no prior record,
there was no evidence he had anything to do with Doroff's death and
he may not be able to graduate from Trinity. He also noted that the
student had volunteered as a tutor.
</P>
<P>
   Eaves' attorney, Gerald Klein, noted that his client was
expelled from college and lost a close friend. Klein said heroin
residue was found in the dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that's not shock therapy, then I don't know what is,''
Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   After court, Eaves vowed to change his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I miss my best friend very dearly,'' Eaves said. ''My life is
at rock bottom now but at least I have a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaves' parents, Rebecca and Willard Eaves, said they were sorry
for the death of Doroff.
</P>
<P>
   ''But for the grace of God, there could have been four of
them,'' Willard Eaves said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Agrees to Foreign Policy Debate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore accepted an invitation to an April
foreign policy debate with George W. Bush on Friday, even though
the Texas governor has said repeatedly it's still way too early.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope he will reconsider his decision,'' Gore spokesman Doug
Hattaway said in a statement. ''Bush still has the opportunity to
agree to Gore's challenge to drop radio and TV ads and hold regular
debates on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been proposed by CNN and the Council on Foreign
Relations. It was scheduled to run 60 minutes in late April and
feature questions from journalists and international affairs
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said, ''There'll be plenty of
time for debates when the voters are paying attention to the
election. There will be debates.''

<HEADLINE> AM-NJ--World Bank Protest, Bjt,550  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) -- Hundreds of activists planned a
Saturday rally outside a World Bank and International Monetary Fund
conference, touting the protest as ''picking up where Seattle left
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the New Jersey/New York Mobilization for Global
Justice said protesters did not plan to disrupt the weekend
meetings sponsored by the two organizations and the Brookings
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But two women who were part of the World Trade Organization
protests in Seattle in December were arrested Thursday for
unfurling a 40-foot banner from the top of the Hamilton Park
Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Kuhn, 19, of Salt Lake City and Judith Karpova, 54, of
Hoboken were charged with criminal trespassing, criminal mischief,
and possession of burglary tools, authorities said. The two used
bolt cutters to cut the chain on a trap door to the roof of the
hotel before unfurling the banner that read ''World Bank and IMF 
Corporate Colonialism'', authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Rally organizer Ted Glick said the coalition didn't advocate
violence or civil disobedience, but ''a number of us thought that
was a nice action.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately, we can't stop them,'' he said of groups who may
decide to protest more forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 officers, some with horses and police dogs, have
been patrolling the conference center near Morristown since the
conference began on Thursday, said Steven Foley, a spokesman for
the Morris County Prosecutor's Office. Police erected metal
barricades and first aid tents and videotaped protesters from a
hotel window.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said the preparations were precautionary, but a reaction
to the violence and destruction that paralyzed Seattle sessions of
the World Trade Organization. Those protests caused $2.5 million in
damage, a state of emergency in the city and the arrests of 500
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Activists, in a news release, said the protest here would be
''picking up where Seattle left off.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people are expected to protest on April
16-18 at World Bank and IMF meetings in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition blames the WTO, the World bank and the IMF for
globalization of the world economy. They believe the World Bank and
the IMF, charged with using international corporations to try to
improve life in developing countries, instead throw the countries
into debt while enriching corporations and degrading the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people attending the conference are meeting to discuss
the collapse of economies in Asia and its effect on developing
countries. Bank spokesman Andrew Kircher said the bank has noticed
a rising level of awareness of the meetings in the United States,
especially since the Seattle protests.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters began a vigil on Thursday, and four slept by the
side of the road Thursday night, surrounded by signs with messages
like ''Break the Boomerang of Debt'' and ''Honk for Global
Justice.'' On Friday, mounted police, including officials standing
on the hotel roof with binoculars, outnumbered the 20 or so
protesters that marched about a mile from a teach-in on Drew
University's campus.
</P>
<P>
   Police will keep protesters inside a barricaded parking lot on
the campus of Fairleigh Dickinson University next to the conference
center on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rebels Lobby vs. Aid Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels lobbied Friday against a
controversial Colombia aid package moving through the U.S.
Congress, inviting American legislators to come visit them in the
jungle.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
called for lawmakers to tour coca plantations and see how rural
poverty underlies the South American country's booming cocaine
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors would see firsthand that solving the drug problem
''has nothing to do armed helicopters or spraying which destroys
our ecosystem, nor with sophisticated intelligence equipment or
American troops,'' said a statement read to Radionet radio by FARC
commander Ivan Rios. The statement said it would be more effective
to legalize drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House of Representatives approved a $1.7 billion
emergency aid package Thursday aimed at helping Colombia regain
control of the country's south, where the FARC taxes drug
traffickers and peasants who grow coca plants.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate must still consider the plan, which would provide
Colombia with dozens of military helicopters and pay for a
stepped-up police program to fumigate drug crops with deadly
herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   Critics worry the United States is getting dangerously involved
in a decades-old guerrilla conflict that has claimed at least
30,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the FARC invited the lawmakers to Cartagena
del Chaira, a poor southern town where it has proposed a pilot
project to help wean poor farmers away from drug crops.
</P>
<P>
   The aid package being debated in Washington includes funds for
so-called alternative development programs. But U.S. officials have
said they would not be willing to work with the FARC, the region's
largest leftist insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government cut off diplomatic contacts with the FARC

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb Bids For Wesley Jessen  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- After failing to negotiate a buyout of
Wesley Jessen VisionCare Inc., Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc. is going straight
to the cosmetic contact-lens company's shareholders in a bid to
gain control.
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb, which has strength in premium disposable lenses,
said Friday it will commence a tender offer Monday for all
outstanding shares of Des Plaines, Ill.-based Wesley Jessen at a
price of $34 a share in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed purchase price amounts to a 37 percent premium over
Wesley Jessen's stock price on March 22 when Bausch &AMP; Lomb made an
unsolicited offer to buy the cosmetic color lens maker for $600
million.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Wesley Jessen have since risen past that level,
finishing regular trading at $35.93}, down 31\ cents on Friday.
Shares of Bausch &AMP; Lomb rose $3.18} to $52.18} on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations had been under way for a few weeks when Wesley
Jessen, preferring to take its own expansionist route, announced
March 20 it had agreed to buy Ocular Sciences Inc., a rival contact
lens maker in South San Francisco, for $413 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Surprised by the move, Bausch &AMP; Lomb said it had no interest in
acquiring Ocular Sciences and moved instead to take its offer
directly to Wesley Jessen shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Once its tender offer is complete -- if successful, the process
could take weeks or even months -- the company said it intends to
acquire any shares not purchased in the tender offer for the same
cash price.
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb's chief executive, William Carpenter, said he
would still prefer to negotiate ''a mutually acceptable transaction
in which Wesley Jessen management would become part of our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Wesley Jessen rejected Bausch &AMP; Lomb's takeover
offer as inadequate and said it remained committed to its pending
merger with Ocular Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Jessen controls about two-thirds of the highly profitable
cosmetic color-lens market. It had $311.7 million in sales last
year while Bausch &AMP; Lomb had contact-lens revenues of $475 million.
</P>
<P>
   If Bausch &AMP; Lomb grabs control of Wesley Jessen, it would come
within distance of market leader Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which had about
$900 million in contact-lens revenues in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Is Up 114.94; Dow Off 58.33  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks came back from the brink
Friday, pulling the Nasdaq composite index higher for the first
time this week. But investors turned toward well-established
computer makers and networking companies, and shunned Internet
businesses now seen as risky investments at the end of a volatile
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose 114.94 to close at 4,572.83. In
earlier trading, the Nasdaq had fallen as much as 76 points and
appeared to be in danger of extending its losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq finished the week with a loss of 390 points, and is
9.4 percent below its March 10 record high close of 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   But even after its recent slump, the Nasdaq ended the first
quarter with a 12.4 percent gain. The Dow Jones industrial average
fell 5 percent during the quarter, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
rose 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Dow average gave up solid early gains and closed
down 58.33 at 10,921.92. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 10.66 to
1,498.58.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq rose as investors bought stocks that were beaten down
in this week's technology selloff. Stalwarts like Dell Computer, up
1} to 53 15/16, and Intel, up 4 15/16 to 131 15/16, led the
advancers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also embraced companies that build the infrastructure
of computers and the Internet. Cisco Systems gained 3 11/16 to 77
5/16 and JDS Uniphase rose 4 5/16 to 120 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of technology stocks' disastrous performance this
week, investors were exercising extreme caution, said Charles
White, president and portfolio manager at Avatar Associates in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stocks doing well today are the ones you've always wanted
to own, the ones with good products, strong revenues and solid
business models,'' he said. ''The companies without those
attributes are going to have a very hard time for the foreseeable
future.''
</P>
<P>
   White pointed to drkoop.com, the online health information
provider, which fell 41 percent, or by 2 9/16 to 3 11/16, after
auditors questioned the viability of the company.
</P>
<P>
   E.Spire Communications, a struggling provider of Internet access
and phone services, fell for a second consecutive session after
saying it might not have enough cash to continue its operations and
repay its loans through the end of this year. Shares fell 2 21/32
to 7 1/32.
</P>
<P>
   Business-to-business Internet companies declined broadly after
Prudential Securities downgraded several stocks in the sector.
Ariba fell 10] to 209|.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one will argue that technology stocks are cheap, but some
are more justifiable than others,'' White said. ''You have to be
selective.''
</P>
<P>
   The resurgence of the Nasdaq drew some money out of the
blue-chip stocks that have performed well this week. General
Electric fell 3[ to 155|.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco fell about 16 percent, or by 2\ to 11 7/16, after the
insurance and financial services company said it will record a $350
million charge and may sell its consumer finance unit.
</P>
<P>
   The market was somewhat rattled in early trading by a pair of
economic reports that provided a mixed picture of the economy's
strength.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported personal income rose 0.4
percent in February but that Americans' spending rose more than
twice as fast. That pulled the nation's savings rate down to an
all-time monthly low, and fed expectations that the Federal Reserve
will raise interest rates at least once more this year in its bid
to slow the economy to sustainable levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no signs of any significant slowdown for consumer
spending,'' said Stan Shipley, senior economist at Merrill Lynch.
''The economy is clearly growing too fast for the Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some market watchers drew encouragement from a second report
that showed orders to U.S. factories were down for the second
straight month in February.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, three stocks rose for every
two that fell.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.46 billion shares, compared with 1.43
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.53 to 539.09.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.5 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 0.6 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 1.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Lawyer Urges Objectivity  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A tobacco company attorney asked jurors Friday to
set aside any bias they might have against an unpopular industry
and reject the $14.4 million in damage claims by three smokers with
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The smokers' attorney suggested the jury should ''just bury
these tobacco companies,'' Philip Morris Inc. attorney Dan Webb
said in closing arguments. But he told jurors that the smokers,
rather than the nation's five biggest cigarette makers, ''must
accept the legal responsibility for the consequences of the choices
they made.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the tobacco companies on trial in this case are not
popular in this country today,'' Webb said, but he urged jurors to
set aside ''your biases, your sympathy and your prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury decided in July that the industry fraudulently
conspired to produce a dangerous product and will be asked next
week whether the smokers are entitled to compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   If the jury awards any money, it will hear more evidence on
punitive damages for about 500,000 sick Florida smokers covered by
the lawsuit. The industry, which already owes states about $250
billion, fears a $300 billion punitive award.
</P>
<P>
   The jury will be asked to set damages for the medical bills,
lost income, lost services, pain and suffering from lung cancer in
Mary Farnan and the late Angie Della Vecchia and throat cancer in
Frank Amodeo.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on Farnan, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. attorney Ben Reid
cited defense testimony that bronchioalveolar cancer -- a form of
lung cancer that the jury did not blame on smoking -- was the kind
of cancer in her case.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers' witnesses blamed smoking for all three of their
cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Noting 50 million Americans have quit smoking, Reid rejected
nicotine addiction as an issue, saying: ''There's nothing about
cigarettes that keeps people from quitting if they want to quit.''
The jury ruled last July that cigarettes are addictive.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are Philip Morris, Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson
Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc. and the
industry's Council for Tobacco Research and Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Mayor shrugs off indictment, heads to golf course  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT LAUREL, N.J. (AP) -- Camden Mayor Milton Milan stood at the
tee, gripped a 7 iron and promptly fired his ball into a creek.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm probably hitting them the best I ever hit them, at least
my short game,'' Milan joked Friday. ''I'm just here to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours earlier, Milan surrendered to federal
authorities who accused him of running a ''pay to play'' scheme
inside City Hall that netted him free cars, home improvements and
more than $30,000 in bribes from mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday morning he was at Ramblewood Country Club, a suburban
golf course about 10 miles from Camden, the nation's fifth-poorest
city.
</P>
<P>
   The round of golf was already scheduled and Milan said he saw no
reason not to play -- not even a 19-count indictment that linked him
to the head of Philadelphia's organized crime family.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel good, I'm not embarrassed, I'm not humiliated. There's
nothing they can't take from me,'' Milan said. ''That's the
difference between growing up in an urban city and not having
anything and growing up in a suburban community where you would
have everything whipped out from under you.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday U.S. Attorney Robert J. Cleary said Milan ''was
corrupted from the minute he set foot in City Hall.'' In a 54-page
indictment, the government alleges that Milan extorted public
officials, collected bribes, stole campaign funds and laundered
drug money.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday state Department of Community Affairs Commissioner
Jane Kenny said Milan's administration repeatedly ignored standard
financial practices. She gave the city two weeks to correct the
problems or else face consequences that could include a state
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   But Milan continued his public denials of all charges. He issued
denials on the steps of City Hall before turning himself in to
federal marshals. On the steps of the federal courthouse three
hours later after posting bail, Milan again denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   In a break in his golf match, Milan thanked his upbringing,
''the Marine Corps and the good Lord'' for the strength to be
upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today I stand strong as a mayor, feeling good, very
confident,'' Milan said. ''Yesterday was the first time I was down,
but I was back up three hours later.''
</P>
<P>
   Milan's civil attorney, Carlos Morcate, was in the mayor's
fivesome.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it says a lot a lot about his spirit, that he showed
up,'' said Morcate, one of the witnesses who appeared before the
grand jury that indicted Milan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Considering WTO Steel Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration said Friday it is
considering whether to appeal a decision by the World Trade
Organization that an 84-year-old American law used to combat
low-priced steel imports violated WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
   A WTO panel in Geneva ruled in favor of a complaint filed by the
European Union, supported by Japan, against the 1916 Anti-Dumping
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., had sued foreign importers
under the law as part of a long-running battle against low-priced
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO panel said the law was illegal because it allowed for
fines and imprisonment in addition to the payment of damages by
companies and individuals found guilty of selling steel at
below-cost prices to unfairly gain market share. Under WTO rules,
import tariffs are the only remedies allowed to combat such
dumping.
</P>
<P>
   ''The panel erred in concluding that the 1916 Act should be
analyzed under anti-dumping rules despite the many distinctions
between the 1916 Act and anti-dumping measures,'' U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said that it would decide whether to file an
appeal once the WTO formally issued its report, expected in a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the steel company said the manufacturer expected
the United States to continue the case before a WTO appellate
panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 1916 act is a sovereign matter,'' said Wheeling-Pitt
spokesman Jim Kosowski. ''It's our understanding that the U.S.
government is going to fight that.''
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer had sued Russian and Japanese importers under
the long-unused law, claiming the companies were guilty of dumping,
</P>
<P>
   All of the defendants settled, Kosowski said, but an appeal is
pending over U.S. District Judge Edmund Sargus' ruling that the law
did not give him the authority to issue an immediate injunction in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear
arguments in the case on April 28, Kosowski said.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical WTO case, when the United States either does not
appeal or loses on appeal, it must either change federal law to
conform with WTO rules, provide compensation to foreign countries
or face the risk of retaliation by those countries against U.S.
exports.

<HEADLINE> Wichita St. Student Body Head Ousted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Wichita State University students have
ousted their student body president, who came under fire after he
used his family's food stamps to stock a campus fund-raiser and
then took reimbursement from student funds.
</P>
<P>
   J. Alberto Fregoso lost a recall election held Wednesday and
Thursday, 269-209. He declined to comment afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began in November, when Fregoso, a 29-year-old
father of four, bought food for a Student Government Association
fund-raiser using his family's state food stamp card. He was later
reimbursed with a $90.54 check from the organization, which is
supported by student fees.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed against him, but the state Department
of Social and Rehabilitation Services is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Fregoso has said it was an honest mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been incredibly stressful,'' said Ernie Webb, a student
senator. ''I'm glad the students' voices were finally heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The student body president receives $8,580 as a state employee
for the yearlong term. Fregoso's term was not up until June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Fregoso could appeal to the university's Supreme Court but had
not done so Friday.

<HEADLINE> Camden's faulty financial practices could force state takeover  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- State overseers on Friday gave Mayor Milton
Milan's administration two weeks to correct long-standing improper
financial practices or face consequences that could include a state
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came a day after Milan was indicted on charges
that include extortion, money laundering and mail fraud.
Authorities say Milan accepted payoffs and gifts from city
contractors and took bribes from organized crime figures.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state's poorest city does not meet any of the legal
requirements for a takeover, Department of Community Affairs
Commissioner Jane Kenny said she asked the attorney general for
''options'' if the deadline is not met.
</P>
<P>
   ''State takeover is one of the options. If the city doesn't
comply with the deadline, it's one of the options we can look at,''
Kenny said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Camden does not keep proper financial records, including a
general ledger and an account of city payouts, all of which are
required by state law, Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny said she could withhold $13.4 million in state aid that
Camden needs to balance its budget. Without that aid, the city
would fail to meet its payroll and other obligations, Kenny said.
It also would then meet one of the legal criteria to have the state
assume city operations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been unwilling to withhold financial aid from the city
of Camden for obvious reasons,'' Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   Since July city finances have been scrutinized by a state review
board. But that oversight committee was only appointed after Milan
threatened to file for bankruptcy and shut down city services.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State DeForest B. Soaries, Jr. said city officials
have ignored any help offered by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''But stonewalling has been in large measure the option they
have chosen,'' Soaries said.
</P>
<P>
   Milan rejected any talk of a takeover and said the state should
aid his city by bringing in more businesses. Gov. Christie Whitman
should allow a $20 million fund designated for the Camden
waterfront to be used throughout the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor, if she wanted to help, she wouldn't be taking us
to the grindstone with the damn financial review board,'' Milan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny and Soaries joined Camden County Prosecutor Lee Solomon in
a meeting with representatives of Camden's nonprofit social
services. Solomon's office is supervising Camden's police
department.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was to assure those groups that the state would
continue to fund programs and help them provide services, Kenny
said.
</P>
<P>
   That assurance is needed now, Soaries said, because the city's
financial plight is ''exacerbated by the chaos caused by the
indictments at City Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny said the public needed to know ''we are not abandoning
Camden.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the state does not assume city operations, Kenny said
her office will take action if officials fail again to make the
corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to do something,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Blair Reappoints Bluebloods to Lords  </HEADLINE>
By MAUREEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Just months after expelling aristocrats from the
House of Lords, Labor Prime Minister Tony Blair has reappointed a
clutch of bluebloods to Britain's upper chamber, while the
Conservatives gave a title to a billionaire tax exile who is a
major party donor.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments sparked renewed calls Friday for the Lords to
be elected or chosen by an independent commission, rather than
appointed by the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-member list of new peers announced Thursday -- including
20 Laborites -- revived charges that Blair is packing the chamber
with cronies, and that opposition Conservatives exchanged a peerage
for cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sort of thing contaminates the honors system,'' said
Labor lawmaker Tony Wright, chairman of an all-party constitutional
committee.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Blair expelled about 600 peers with inherited
titles of nobility, and the Lords now mainly consist of commoners
given lifetime titles. Their power is restricted to delaying
legislation for up to one year.
</P>
<P>
   A blue-ribbon committee recommended in January that the new
House of Lords be mainly chosen by an independent commission.
Blair, who pledged to completely reform the body after Labor came
to power in 1997, has not said whether he will accept the
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, critics said a title was given to expatriate
Michael Ashcroft in reward for his $4.8 million in donations to the
Conservative party, some of whose own members criticized the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cash for coronets has plumbed new depths,'' sniped Labor
legislator Peter Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, currently based in Belize, has lived outside Britain
for 15 years. The Conservative party treasurer, he was refused a
peerage last year because of concerns over his business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It reminds me of the way medieval popes made their nephews
into cardinals,'' said Viscount Cranborne, the Conservatives'
former Leader of the Lords, said of his appointment.
</P>
<P>
   However, officials announced Thursday that Ashcroft would be
made a baron if he returns to live in Britain. Cranborne said it
was unprecedented to grant a peerage with conditions attached.
</P>
<P>
   Menzies Campbell, a spokesman for the Liberal Democrat party,
said Ashcroft's peerage was further proof that Britain needs an
elected second chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rules would not have been bent if Mr. Ashcroft had not
been a 3 million (pound) supporter'' of the Conservatives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tory leader in the upper house, Lord Strathclyde, accused
Labor of making a fuss to divert attention from Blair's
''stuffing'' the House with his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said he was ''both thrilled and honored.'' He is
expected to announce within days that he is stepping down as United
Nations ambassador for Belize as the first step toward taking up
the peerage. He said he would come back to Britain by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   With the new appointments, the 701-member Lords will have 236
Tories and 202 Laborites. Most of the rest are independents or
belong to other parties.

<HEADLINE> Yemen President Leaves Conference  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RACHMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Yemen's president abruptly left a conference
here Friday after being asked about allowing Israelis to visit the
Arabian Peninsula nation, event organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   A Yemeni diplomat did answer the question, but then he and
President Ali Abdullah Saleh walked out of the luncheon meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first question he got was to clarify the policy on
Israelis and Jews coming to Yemen,'' said organizer Hadass Tesher.
''Then everybody left.''
</P>
<P>
   Yemeni Ambassador to the United Nations Abdalla Ashtal
acknowledged there was controversy over the issue of allowing the
thousands of Jews of Yemeni origin to return to their ancestral
homes. But he insisted that nothing out of the ordinary happened at
the luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president didn't storm out,'' Ashtal said. ''He just left
a little early.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Cohen, a senior analyst with the Washington-based Center
for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation, which organized the
conference, said the Yemeni diplomats had dealt with the sensitive
issue, and did not want to return to it.
</P>
<P>
   The conference attended by policy experts dealt with Yemen's
role in the Mideast peace process and its relations with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A briefing for journalists after the luncheon was canceled.
Cohen blamed organizational confusion.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, most of the 50,000 Jews living in Yemen
emigrated to the new state of Israel. They left behind synagogues
and property in impoverished Yemen, which now has a Jewish
population of about 400.
</P>
<P>
   Yemen has said it will not establish ties with Israel before an
overall Middle East settlement is in place. Yemen allows Israeli
Jews of Yemeni descent to visit, provided they have special travel
documents, Ashtal said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Jews returning to Yemen was inflamed this week when
a dozen Israelis, including politicians and theologians, went there
for a four-day visit but were ignored by senior officials. The
group had hoped to be considered an official delegation.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Recovery Will Be Costly  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Dawn Syganowski stood Friday in a pile
of rubble that was her home and looked at the sky-blue walls of her
infant daughter's room, now buckling under the weight of
tornado-strewn debris.
</P>
<P>
   She said she spent weeks painting a floating princess and fluffy
white clouds on those sheet rock walls, a reminder of the
overwhelming job of rebuilding ahead of her because of Tuesday
night's tornadoes in north Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just glad my kids are too young to remember this,'' she
said with a trembling voice, leafing through a jumble of baby items
for the match to a tiny pink slipper.
</P>
<P>
   Her house, now missing a roof and most exterior walls, must be
demolished, and Syganowski was thankful her family was not home
when the twisters hit, killing at least four people in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the family was joining with their neighbors in a
feverish race to collect their shredded belongings as storm clouds
loomed overhead.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two tornadoes ripped through downtown Fort Worth just
after the evening rush hour Tuesday, while another damaged more
than 1,200 homes in Arlington and Grand Prairie. Among the 33
buildings damaged in Arlington were a Texas Department of Health
building, a Post Office and a Bell Helicopter plant.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance adjusters estimated the damage to Tarrant County was
at least $450 million. A fifth person was missing and presumed
dead.
</P>
<P>
   In Kelly Anderson's Arlington neighborhood Friday, city workers
used huge front-end loaders to scoop masses of sheet rock, brick
and trash off front yards and into dump trucks en to a city
landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of volunteers had converged on the neighborhood,
offering bottled water, boxes and words of encouragement. The area
will be cordoned off by police throughout the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson carried boxes from his toppled home to a moving truck
holding the promise of a new start. He said he had to focus on the
work ahead and not the loss of his home.
</P>
<P>
   But he kept searching for the one item he said was irreplaceable
-- a Christmas tree he decorated each year for his father's grave.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's something I need to find,'' he said. ''I hope it's not
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's wife, Toni, said she was distraught that no financial
aid had been offered to the couple, who fear their insurance won't
cover their property loss. Additionally, the couple has taken
unpaid leave from their jobs and were worried they cannot afford to
rent an apartment while continuing their mortgage payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reality has just set in,'' she said. ''What are we going to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush declared Tarrant County a disaster area, and
damage assessment teams from the Federal Emergency Management and
the Small Business Administration arrived Friday to help state
leaders prepare paperwork for federal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that the federal agencies respond quickly,''
said Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas, who toured damaged homes in Grand
Prairie on Friday. ''Very few people have insurance that will cover
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, workers have been removing thousands of window
panes damaged in eight skyscrapers. Officials said Friday they
would halt the removal of glass this weekend so workers could enter
their offices and salvage materials. The glass removal was expected
to resume Monday.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds KKK Highway Rule  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI ANGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A court ruling that allowed the Ku Klux Klan to
participate in the state's ''Adopt-A-Highway'' program was upheld
by a federal appeals court Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The state transportation department said it initially refused to
let the Klan adopt a stretch of Interstate 55 in south St. Louis
because the Klan discriminated against people based on their color,
religion and national origin.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
agreed with a lower court's ruling that barring the group was
discriminatory and unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ''The First Amendment protects everyone, even those with
viewpoints as thoroughly obnoxious as those of the Klan, from
viewpoint-based discrimination by the state,'' the ruling said.
''There are better ways of countering the Klan's repellent
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an affirmation of every principle I have been fighting
for,'' said Robert Herman, the American Civil Liberties Union
attorney who represented the KKK. ''The state is not in the
business of rewarding or punishing people for their views.''
</P>
<P>
   Transportation officials have not decided whether to appeal to
the U.S. Supreme Court, spokesman Tom Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the department reluctantly allowed the Klan into
the litter-control program based on an October ruling in U.S.
District Court that said it would be discriminatory to forbid the
group from participating in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Klan has participated about three months, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The signs that mark the highway as having been adopted by the
Klan have been vandalized twice and are not currently in place.
Miller said they would be returned in about two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Gore Making Political Conversions  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore is moving to please voter
constituencies he'll need to win the presidency, whether that means
breaking with the White House over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez or
shifting positions to court homosexuals, labor groups, blacks and
women.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Republican George W. Bush challenged his Democratic
rival to prove he's ''not playing Florida politics'' in the case of
the Cuban boy caught at the center of a U.S.-Cuba custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts are divided over whether the vice president's
conversions weaken his credibility or help him establish his own
identity apart from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly feeds a pre-exisiting impression that many people
have, that electoral politics play a critical part in all of his
calculations,'' said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the guy who gave up the white shirt and the red tie
for earth tones,'' he added. ''All politicians trim and tack here
and there, but some get tagged with being calculating
politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University in
Atlanta, thinks the Gonzalez case in particular shows that Gore is
a cunning candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what he's trying to do is show he's a bold leader and
he will do what he thinks is right, which to him may have the happy
result of winning votes or at least neutralizing the opposition of
others,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gore broke with the administration by saying that
he supported legislation that would grant Elian Gonzalez and his
Cuban relatives permanent U.S. residency. He also wants the case
heard in a family court, not decided by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The administration argues that Elian should be taken from his
Miami relatives and reunited with his Cuban father. That position
has enraged Cuban Americans in South Florida -- and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the vice president is serious and not playing Florida
politics, he ought to stand up and say to the attorney general,
'You've got the power to back the INS off so that the fate of this
young man will not be determined by bureaucratic decree,''' Bush
told reporters while campaigning in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   With 25 electoral votes, Florida is the fourth-biggest prize in
November's general election. The state generally votes Republican
in presidential elections, but Clinton won it in a three-way race
in 1996, gaining 40 percent of the Cuban-American vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who runs strong among Florida's seniors, hopes to win
enough of the Cuban-American vote as well to threaten Bush with a
loss in a state that's run by his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the governor of Texas, gets indignant when asked about
Gore's changing positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This man will say anything to get elected,'' is his constant
refrain.
</P>
<P>
   That echos the sentiments of Bill Bradley during the Democratic
primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''He claims these issues are priorities for him,'' Bradley said
of Gore in February, after he accused his rival of trying to co-opt
his positions. ''But priorities come from convictions, not through
polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Some examples of the vice president's shifts:
</P>
<P>
   --During a January debate, Gore courted homosexuals by saying he
would require that his appointees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff
agree that gays be allowed to serve openly in the military. When
that triggered criticism, Gore backpedaled, saying, ''I did not
mean to imply that there should ever be any kind of inquiry into
the personal political opinions of officers in the U.S. military.''
</P>
<P>
   --Meeting privately with AFL-CIO officials in mid-February, Gore
reportedly told the union bosses that, if elected, he could
negotiate a better trade deal with the Chinese than the
administration on the issues of environmental and working
conditions. When a business group complained to the White House,
Gore issued a statement saying he stood behind the administration's
landmark agreement to permit China enter the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   --Speaking to Jewish leaders in New York in early March, Gore
hinted he would support moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem, despite Palestinian opposition. ''My desires are
the same as your desires,'' he said. Gore also has met with Al
Sharpton, a black leader in the state.
</P>
<P>
   --Several days later, Gore bid for supporters of former
presidential candidate John McCain by pledging to make the Arizona
senator's signature issue -- campaign finance reform -- his own
political centerpiece. The vice president said he had learned from
the ''mistakes'' he made raising money during the 1996 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   --Last fall, Gore even moved his campaign headquarters from
Washington to Nashville, Tenn., after Bradley posed serious
competition. The vice president also swapped his conservative
business suits for a new look of earth-toned sports coats and
slacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has greeted Gore's campaign moves
with understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gore broke with Clinton on the Gonzalez case, White
House spokesman Jake Siewert said the president was not angry. Such
differences, Siewert said, should be expected as Gore's campaign
unfolds. ''His office spoke to the chief of staff's office,''
Siewert said, ''and we let the president know.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said the Gonzalez decision ''was a
tough political call,'' but it was consistent with the vice
president's long-held belief that the case should be resolved in
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll make his stands when he thinks it's the right thing to
do, whether or not it pleases everybody,'' Hattaway said. ''I don't
buy this line of argument from political opponents.''

<HEADLINE> Custody Deal in Switched Babies Case  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL TOLME, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAFFORD, Va. (AP) -- A judge signed a custody agreement Friday
that ended a legal struggle between the families of two girls
switched at birth at the University of Virginia Medical Center in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   No family members attended the hearing where Stafford Circuit
Judge James W. Haley Jr. signed the agreement announced last week.
Under the settlement, the 4-year-old girls will remain with the
families who have been raising them and both sides will have
regular visitation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is far and away the best disposition of this
case,'' Haley said, complimenting lawyers for both families.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Johnson agreed to drop her effort to adopt Rebecca
Chittum, her biological daughter. Johnson will continue raising
Callie Conley and became the girl's legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the closest thing to being a mommy without adoption,''
said Kenneth Mergenthal, a lawyer for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was sent home from the state-operated hospital in
Charlottesville with Callie, the biological daughter of a Buena
Vista couple, Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers. Chittum and Rogers
took home Johnson's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The switch was discovered in July 1998 when DNA tests were
performed in a child-support dispute between Johnson and her
ex-boyfriend, Carlton Conley. That same month, Chittum and Rogers
died in a car crash without ever learning of the switch. Their
parents have taken turns caring for Rebecca.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Sharply Against Yen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The yen jumped against other currencies Friday,
reaching its highest level against the dollar since the beginning
of the year, on expectations that Japan may report strong economic
data on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 102.64
Japanese yen, down sharply from 105.46 on Thursday. It was the
yen's highest level since Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp move came as currency traders anticipated a strong
reading of Japanese business sentiment when the Bank of Japan
releases its quarterly survey on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, known by its Japanese abbreviation of Tankan, is
closely watched by economists as an indicator of future business
activity. If it shows a long-awaited improvement in sentiment, it
could lift hopes for a turnaround in Japan's sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
   Previous upward jolts in the yen have been met with market
intervention by Japan's central bank, which sees an overly strong
yen as a threat to Japan's economy. A high yen cuts down the
profits of large Japanese companies like Sony, which rely heavily
on overseas markets for their sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan was not seen to be intervening in markets
Friday, but that could change on Monday if the Tankan report comes
in with strong numbers, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was less changed against other currencies, trading at
1.6643 Swiss francs, up from 1.6576, and 1.4499 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.4554.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was quoted at 95.59 cents, down from 96.13 cents, and
the British pound fell to $1.5934 from $1.5954.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0458 German
marks, up from 2.0348; 6.8615 French francs, up-down from 6.8244;
and 2,025.39 Italian lire, up from 2,014.43.

<HEADLINE> FEC Awards Round of Matching Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The seven presidential candidates will receive
$5.9 million in the latest round of government matching funds --
more than half going to Sen. John McCain, the Federal Election
Commission announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who suspended his presidential campaign after the Super
Tuesday primaries March 7, will receive $3.7 million from the
government, a sign of his fund-raising strength after he won the
New Hampshire primary in February. That brought his total to $10.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore will receive another $718,485, bringing
his total to $13.1 million. Former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, who has
abandoned his campaign, will receive another $849,553, bringing his
total to $12.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government matches the first $250 of each individual
contribution for candidates who agree to limit their total primary
spending to $40.5 million. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has
raised a record $75 million, is not accepting federal funds and can
spend as much as he can raise in his GOP presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Two third-party candidates also are receiving federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC said that Patrick Buchanan, seeking the Reform Party
nomination, will get $174,185, bringing his total to $3.3 million,
and John Hagelin of the Natural Law Party will get $100,000, his
first installment of federal funds.

<HEADLINE> Al-Amin Extradition Hearing Set  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, the 1960s black
militant formerly known as H. Rap Brown, will remain jailed for at
least three weeks until his extradition hearing, a judge said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County Circuit Judge Charles Price set the hearing
for April 21. Alabama officials have agreed to send Al-Amin to
Georgia in the slaying of a deputy in Atlanta; Al-Amin's attorney
has promised to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney J.L. Chestnut has alleged Al-Amin was framed by
organized crime and corrupt law enforcement in Atlanta after he
tried to stop prostitution in a black community. Chestnut said
after Friday's hearing he hasn't revealed ''what is really at the
bottom of this,'' but he would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, 56, is charged with murder and assault in the March 16
shooting of two Atlanta sheriff's deputies who were attempting to
serve him with a warrant. Both deputies were wounded; Kinchen later
died.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin was apprehended four days after the shooting in rural
Lowndes County, west of Montgomery.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Allows for Iraq Oil Repairs  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council decided Friday to let
Iraq spend more money to repair its oil industry -- an investment
intended to boost the amount of food and medicine Baghdad can buy
through the U.N. humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid welcomed the decision,
which he called a victory for Iraq. ''When good insists ... evil
backs down,'' Rashid said, speaking in Baghdad before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   All 15 ambassadors voted in favor of the U.S.-sponsored
resolution without comment.
</P>
<P>
   Independent oil industry experts have said Iraq must
rehabilitate its pumping stations if it wants to continue exporting
crude through the U.N. oil-for-food program, which lets Baghdad buy
humanitarian goods using proceeds from U.N.-supervised oil sales.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad's oil industry -- its main source of revenue -- was
targeted during the Persian Gulf War and has been decimated by
nearly 10 years of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. oil-for-food program was started in 1996 to provide for
Iraqis suffering under sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Security Council agreed to allow Iraq to use $300
million every six months from oil-for-food proceeds to buy spare
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's resolution increases that amount to $600 million for
the six-month phase of the program that began in November, as well
as retroactively for the previous six-month period. It says the
council would consider renewing the provision in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also says the council would be willing to
consider other ways to improve the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock urged Iraq to take
advantage of the new spare parts allowance, which he said would
enable Baghdad to export more oil and buy more goods to meet the
needs of its people.
</P>
<P>
   ''This extra revenue and the welcome decision by the government
of Iraq to increase its oil production will bring a significant new
element of cash into the program,'' Greenstock told reporters after
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq used to be limited to selling $5.2 billion worth of oil
every six months under the oil-for-food program, but in December
the council agreed to remove any ceiling on oil sales to buy
humanitarian supplies. But experts have said Iraq cannot increase
its output by much without major repairs.
</P>
<P>
   After refusing for months, the United States agreed to the
measure and sponsored the resolution to try to deflect criticism of
its tough line on Iraq sanctions, which has come under increasing
fire at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Ambassador James Cunningham introduced the draft on
March 24 during an open debate of the council at which most
ambassadors and Secretary-General Kofi Annan criticized the U.S.
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, they complained that the United States was paralyzing
repairs on the oil industry by placing more than $1 billion in
contracts for spare parts and other equipment on ''hold'' in the
U.N. sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
   Washington says it has to review the contracts to make sure the
equipment isn't used to help Iraqi President Saddam Hussein rebuild
his weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Candidates Get Free Air Time  </HEADLINE>
By MELINDA DESLATTE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Four North Carolina TV stations Saturday
will begin airing free, two-minute spots in which the state's five
leading gubernatorial candidates answer issues-oriented questions.
</P>
<P>
   They join a handful of outlets nationwide heeding a White House
commission's call to furnish free air time to candidates before
primaries and general elections.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Broadcasting Co. will run three issue messages every day
in April, leading up to the May 2 primary, on its four stations --
WRAL in Raleigh, WJZY in Charlotte, WRAZ in Durham and WILM in
Wilmington. Each candidate filmed three segments that will be
rotated throughout the month during morning, evening and late-night
newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is we just don't think issues get out there
enough. It seems they get overshadowed by negative commercials,''
said John Harris, director of special programming of WRAL, who
helped develop the format.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Better Campaigns said 25 stations nationwide
plan to offer similar spots to candidates this year. Supporters
also say free air time could reduce the influence of money on
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The five candidates -- Democrats Dennis Wicker and Mike Easley
and Republicans Leo Daughtry, Chuck Neely and Richard Vinroot --
were required to devote one TV spot to the lottery and another to a
childhood education program. They were allowed to choose any
subject for the third spot, with one condition -- no attacks on the
other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The stations plan to repeat the format in October, before the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Goodmon, president and CEO of Capitol Broadcasting, served
on the 22-member White House commission that recommended in 1998
that TV stations donate five minutes of air time to candidates in
the month before primaries and general elections.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the industry has ignored the proposal.

<HEADLINE> US Sues for Breast Implant Funds  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department sued on Friday to
recover millions of dollars spent through federal health care plans
to treat silicone breast implant injuries. It asked that the money
come out of a settlement fund for the thousands of women who were
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The government asked the court to halt settlement payments to
victims who used Medicare or other federally funded health care
programs until the federal government gets reimbursed for its
costs.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Birmingham, Ala.,
the government named as defendants six companies and the
administrator of the settlement fund those companies established to
compensate women injured by the implants.
</P>
<P>
   As of last April, 81,000 women had been sent payments from the
settlement fund. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned most
use of silicone gel-filled breast implants in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's lawsuit argues that the six companies and the
settlement fund are liable for reimbursing Medicare and the other
federal health care programs for costs incurred treating implant
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit did not put an exact figure on how much the
government is seeking, but a Justice Department statement said it
was in the millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Care Recovery Act permits the government to recover
the cost of providing medical care to people injured as a result of
the wrongful acts of a third party, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   The government ''demands payments from the MDL (multi-district
litigation) settlement fund of its reasonable costs or providing to
or paying for hospital, medical, surgical or dental care on behalf
of claimants who were, or will be paid through the MDL settlement
fund and-or the common benefit fund for injuries alleged to be
caused by a breast implant,'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice spokesman Charles Miller said the lawsuit took this form
because negotiations to recover the money from the implant
manufacturers had been unsuccessful after several years of talks.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the class action settlement provided injured
women with $3,000 for surgery to remove the implants and additional
payments for those with diseases or injuries allegedly caused by
the implants.
</P>
<P>
   Of the women who have received payments, from the fund, 17,000
got $3,000 for removal surgery, the lawsuit said. Another 26,000
women also received payment for a breast implant-related disease
and another 10,000 received a one-time $2,500 payment to waive all
future claims.
</P>
<P>
   As of last May, 52,118 implant recipients had refused to join
the class action, preserving their right to press their claims
individually, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said the companies and the settlement fund
administrator failed to determine whether any of the women making
claims had been Medicare beneficiaries before sending them payments
from the settlement fund. It said the defendants had not paid the
government on behalf of any Medicare-treated women who obtained
settlement payments.
</P>
<P>
   The companies named in the lawsuit were Baxter International
Inc.. Baxter Healthcare Corp., Bristol-Meyers-Squibb Co., 3M Co.,
Union Carbide Chemical and Plastics Co., and Union Carbide Corp.
Edgar C. Gentile III was named in his capacity as escrow agent of
the settlement fund.

<HEADLINE> Group Loses White House e-mail Bid  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A conservative group was rebuffed Friday in
its effort to have a federal judge take custody of hundreds of
thousands of White House computer messages in the e-mail
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing before U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, the
group, Judicial Watch, sought to have the Executive Office of the
President found in contempt of court, claiming White House
officials tampered with a computer disk containing some of the
electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch lawyer Larry Klayman focused on the White House's
acknowledgment in congressional testimony Thursday that a mishap
had occurred with a ''zip disk'' containing e-mails among Monica
Lewinsky, Betty Currie and another White House aide.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, which computer experts are still looking into, made
it impossible for the White House to read the contents of the disk.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyer James Gilligan provided assurances
that there were a number of duplicate copies of the disk's contents
and that any problem the White House created on the disk was
inadvertent.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth rejected Klayman's request that the court hold an
evidentiary hearing which could have been the first step in the
White House surrendering custody of the e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Klayman's group is representing former Reagan and Bush
administration appointees whose FBI background files were gathered
by the Clinton White House in 1993 and 1994, a fact that was not
uncovered until 1996 during a congressional investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A White House contractor has said she was told that e-mails on
the FBI files controversy were among thousands that were not turned
over to Congress or the Justice Department in various
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   An Independent Counsel closed out the criminal investigation of
the FBI files matter, saying there was no credible evidence of
criminal activity in the White House's gathering of the material.

the Central Bank said.

businesses may fit the profile, the details of the measure remained
to be hammered out, a Central Bank press secretary said.

<HEADLINE> Zions Shareholders Reject Deal  </HEADLINE>
By HANNAH WOLFSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Zions Bancorp. shareholders voted down a
proposed merger with First Security Corp. on Friday, killing a $3.4
billion deal that had been fast losing support.
</P>
<P>
   After a tepid statement of support for the merger from Zions
president and CEO Harris Simmons, shareholders representing 45
percent of the outstanding shares voted against the plan. Just over
33 percent voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If nothing else, this meeting today was a great demonstration
of corporate democracy,'' Simmons said. ''It's a meeting we'll sure
long remember.'' He had no further comment immediately after the
votes were tallied.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is a blow to First Security, whose shareholders
approved their half of the agreement last week. The plan called for
First Security shareholders to receive .442 shares in the combined
company for each of their shares; Zions shareholders would have
gotten one share in the combined company for each share they own.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not surprised at all,'' said Eric Reim, a market analyst
with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. ''I think what the
vote reflected was the shareholders' belief that the way this deal
was structured and with what has transpired, it did not make
economic sense to Zions shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the word from the investment banking firm Goldman,
Sachs Group Inc., which announced in March it no longer considered
the deal fair to Zions' shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Originally worth $5.9 billion when it was announced in June, the
deal's value had dropped to about $3.4 billion. Much of the drop
came in early March, when First Security panicked investors with an
announcement that first-quarter earnings were expected to drop by
as much as 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Based its closing stock price Friday, First Security has a
market value of about $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that what probably turned the tide on the no vote was
the institutional investors, who were more swayed by the Goldman
Sachs letter,'' said George Paulson, a Zions shareholder who voted
against the merger.
</P>
<P>
   First Security spokeswoman Jackelin Slack said the company was
''disappointed'' that the Zions' shareholders voted against the
merger and was studying its options.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is the threat of litigation, which was raised by
one First Security investor during Friday's meeting. Simmons said
they do not expect a lawsuit from First Security's management, but
could not rule out litigation altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The failure could leave either bank open to a takeover attempt
from an outside bank. Reim said First Security, with its declining
revenue base, is more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Bank managers are expected to try to renegotiate the terms of
the merger with a stock ratio more favorable to Zions. In the
meantime, it is unclear what effect Friday's votes will have on
operations at Utah's two largest banks, which had already started
to consolidate some departments and sell off redundant branches as
ordered by regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Zions closed trading on the Nasdaq up $3.31\ at $41.62{. First
Security closed up 25 cents at $12.

<HEADLINE> Third child comes forward to accuse dentist of breaking bones  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Prosecutors have decided not to charge a
dentist accused of breaking a 5-year-old's leg while performing a
root canal on the wrong tooth.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office comes as a
third child came forward to accuse Kevin Ward of breaking one of
her bones. Heather Franks said her thumb was broken seven years ago
when the then-9-year-old girl came into Ward's Maywood office to
get a cavity filled.
</P>
<P>
   Ward faces two lawsuits, one filed this week, related to the
other alleged incidents but no disciplinary action from the state
board that regulates dentists.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Dentistry did suspend Ward's license for a
year in 1987 and ordered him to seek training in administering
anesthesia three years after a 4-year-old boy died in his care. The
board later stayed the suspension, however, letting Ward continue
to practice.
</P>
<P>
   Ward has lost two part-time jobs at Maywood and Vernon since the
latest charges against him but continues to work at the Children's
Dental Center in Union City.
</P>
<P>
   His office, surrounded by a purple stone fence and filled with
photographs of Easter bunnies, was full of children on Friday. A
technician said Ward would not comment. His lawyer, Vincent
Loughlin, has not returned repeated telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Hudson County Prosecutor Terrence Hull said the office
decided this week against charging Ward with aggravated assault for
breaking Mario Rivero's leg on Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Ward gave an explanation of how the injury occurred and
prosecutors, after consulting with a doctor, concluded that Ward
didn't intentionally hurt the North Bergen boy, Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   The office did forward results of the investigation to the state
Attorney General's Office, which oversees the dentistry board, Hull
said. A spokesman from the office didn't return a telephone call on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ward pressed down on Mario Rivero's leg so hard that he broke
the right femur after Mario kicked the dentist in the head in pain,
Rivero's parents said. The boy has spent three weeks in traction,
in a cast from his chest down, and has had nightmares, said the
family's lawyer, Leonard Altamura.
</P>
<P>
   Ward was also performing a root canal on the wrong tooth, said
Altamura, who filed a lawsuit against Ward on the family's behalf
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Altamura said he doesn't know whether Ward intended to break
Rivero's leg, but said, ''This is not the first time. This is not
the second time. This is the third time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He is recklessly negligent, outrageously negligent. He should
not be practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward also faces a lawsuit from Cathy Candelieri, the mother of
Amanda Schwab, who was 4 when her wrist was broken at Ward's Vernon
office in 1996. Police never pressed criminal charges, saying the
broken bone was an accident.

   Heather Franks, now 16, visited Ward on Nov. 1, 1993, for a
filling, Maywood police said in a report obtained by The Record of
Hackensack. She said she became upset when Ward put something in
her mouth and tried to get up, but was restrained by Ward and an
assistant, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward told police he restrained Heather out of concern for his
and her safety after he injected her with Novocain and ''she had an
anxiety attack,'' the police report said.
</P>
<P>
   Police also interviewed Ward's assistant, Marylim Rivera, who
said that she held Heather's legs while Ward held her hands down
and covered her mouth after she began kicking and throwing her arms
around. Rivera described the restraint as ''normal procedure when
you have a child who acts up.''

<HEADLINE> Kidnap Suspect Pleads Innocent  </HEADLINE>
By GLORIA PEREZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMOLOYA DE JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) -- A suspect described as one of
Mexico's ''most sought kidnappers'' pleaded innocent to an array of
charges Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am simply a jewelry merchant and I am innocent on all
charges,'' Marcos Tinoco told a judge during arraignment at
Mexico's top security federal prison west of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors told a news conference Thursday that Tinoco used
a law school education and personal charm to gather information on
at least 11 wealthy victims -- most of them Jews -- whom he
kidnapped. In at least one case, he sliced off a victim's finger to
force ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Tinoco, 42, was arrested this week while driving in the upscale
Polanco neighborhood of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the attorney general's organized crime unit, Jose
Trinidad Larrieta, said Thursday that Tinoco was ''one of the
most-sought kidnappers'' and he led ''the most active and dangerous
criminal organization'' today.
</P>
<P>
   Formal charges lodged against him so far include organized crime
and possession of illegal firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of his kidnappings last only a few hours,''
Larrieta said, calling Tinoco the king of rapid kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   But on one occasion, he said, a victim was held for 18 days. A
finger was sliced off and sent to the victim's family.
</P>
<P>
   Ransoms ranged from $38,000 to $650,000, Larrieta said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Tinoco used his legal training to intimidate victims.
The suspect ''created false arrest orders which he showed to his
victims to make them believe there really was a judicial order
against them,'' Larrieta said.
</P>
<P>
   The capture of Tinoco is one in a series of triumphs over famed
kidnapping gangs by federal officials -- though daily newspapers
from around Mexico still often carry reports of new abductions.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic arrest was the August 1998 capture of Daniel
Arizmendi, who was notorious for sending victims' ears to their
families. He is now serving a 50-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Larrieta said police were investigating a possible link between
Tinoco and one of Mexico's most famous drug smugglers, the
now-imprisoned and convicted Hector Palma. He said one of the
victims was held at a house owned by a brother of Palma.

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The second fire in a week in state
government's biggest office plaza left 390 state workers without a

<HEADLINE> Bahamas Govt. Allows Kennedy Visit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Despite the governing party's threat to
keep him out, U.S. environmental activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
arrived in the Bahamas on Friday to speak out against a
controversial development project.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy will address a town meeting Saturday on plans to build
the gated Clifton Cay housing development on New Providence Island.
He will leave Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy secretary general of the governing Free National
Movement party, Oswald Marshall, had warned Kennedy not to come,
hinting that the government would ''put Mr. Kennedy on the
(immigration) stop list for working illegally in the Bahamas.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Missouri Sherman-Peter, permanent secretary of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Friday her agency would not stop
Kennedy from entering the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a staff attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, has campaigned against the project, which he says would
destroy historic sites, harm coral reefs and strip sand from
beaches in the area known as Clifton.

Japanese Volcano Erupts Again
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- A volcano in northern Japan erupted again on Saturday, a
day after it sent a spectacular blue-gray plume of molten rock and ash billowing
two miles above the crater and rolling down the snow-quilted slopes. There were
no immediate reports of damage or injuries from either eruption. Ash dusted
silent, evacuated villages near Mount Usu. Snow fell Friday evening and the
military was called in because of concerns over the possibility of landslides or
mudslides caused by melting runoff.

N. Carolina Looks To Shield Tobacco

   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina, the nation's No. 1 tobacco producer,
will convene a special legislative session Wednesday to shield cigarette makers
from the crippling effects of a possible $300 billion verdict in Florida. The
special protection rankles anti-tobacco forces and troubles some constitutional

necessity in North Carolina, where tobacco generates nearly $1 billion for
farmers and where 114,000 people are employed in tobacco-related jobs.

<HEADLINE> Texas Tax Break on Medicine To Begin  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A state sales tax break on some 100,000
over-the-counter medicines and medical products takes effect
Saturday and includes condoms, despite opposition from Gov. George
W. Bush and other conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The tax break could save families about $17 per year, the
comptroller's office reported. It is projected to cost the state
about $160 million in sales tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Items exempted from the 6.25 percent state sales tax and local
taxes will include allergy treatments, bandages, cough and cold
remedies, vitamins and minerals and many others. Prescription drugs
have been tax-free in Texas since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are items we all need,'' said state Sen. Rodney Ellis,
who helped write the law.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to include condoms on the list of exempted
medicines was made by Republican Comptroller Carole Keeton
Rylander, who said the law dictates what items are tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature specified the tax break should cover any product
that has a National Drug Code number issued by the Food and Drug
Administration and is used to diagnose, treat or prevent disease
and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a matter of interpretation, it's a matter of the
law,'' said Rylander spokesman Mark Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has said abstinence should be promoted to teen-agers,
proposed the tax break in his 1998 re-election campaign but never
wanted condoms included, said his spokesman, Mike Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a small factor in a very beneficial law,'' Jones said.

<HEADLINE> Bennett Founders Claim Downfall Plot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) -- The founders of the bankrupt Bennett Funding
Group, accused of swindling investors in one of the nation's
largest pyramid schemes, claim the company's court-appointed
trustee engineered their downfall to steal their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund T. and Kathleen Bennett filed a suit that seeks $5.8
billion in damages and Richard Breeden's removal as trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Breeden was chairman of the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission
until 1993, when the agency initiated a fraud investigation into
the Bennett empire of hotels, resort financing and investments in
race tracks and gambling enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC filed a civil complaint in 1996 alleging the group
cheated more than 21,000 creditors, including banks and elderly
investors, out of more than $1 billion by selling bogus leases.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund and Kathleen Bennett were never charged, but their sons,
Michael and Patrick, were accused of swindling investors out of
more than $700 million through their business that financed leases
for office equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bennett pleaded guilty in 1998 to conspiracy,
obstruction of justice and perjury and faces a maximum of 15 years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Bennett, convicted last year on 49 charges, was told
Friday by a federal judge that he will serve 20 years in prison if
he gives all of his assets to investors who were cheated in the
scam. Otherwise, the judge warned, he will serve 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit filed Wednesday, the elder Bennetts claim Breeden
manipulated and falsified their companies' books to make the
companies seem insolvent, then orchestrated the federal
investigation and used his influence to gain control.
</P>
<P>
   Breeden has not yet seen the Bennett's lawsuit and had no
immediate comment, said attorney Gary Mucci. The Bennetts have
leveled the same accusations previously and Breeden has denied
them.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed in response to four lawsuits filed by Breeden
seeking the return of $5.8 billion to the companies, the couple
said.

<HEADLINE> Director Mendes Returns To Stage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- After his first venture into movies garnered him
an Oscar for best director, Sam Mendes is headed back to the stage
-- and Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like it was time to do Shakespeare again,'' Mendes said
Friday, sitting in the tiny London theater he has run for nearly 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   The acclaimed theater director has been offered countless movies
following his success with ''American Beauty,'' his first-ever
film. But in July, he will start rehearsals for a new production of
the enduring Shakespeare comedy ''Twelfth Night.''
</P>
<P>
   The show will run Sept. 14-Nov. 25 in the 251-seat Donmar
Warehouse in London's Covent Garden district.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes, 34, said he now expects to switch back and forth between
theater and film. To that end, he started up Donmar Films several
months ago with funding from DreamWorks, the Hollywood studio that
made ''American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg's recently launched studio is to contribute
$160,000 a year to the theater and $400,000 a year to Mendes'
start-up film company for the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes said he's unlikely even to begin preparing another film
before the end of the year, pointing to fellow filmmakers Frank
Darabont (''The Green Mile'') and Anthony Minghella (''The Talented
Mr. Ripley'') as just two directors who take a long time between
projects.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he made clear he had more immediate concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning from Los Angeles with his Oscar, he entered his
north London flat and, before he knew it, the boiler had blown up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things like that,'' he said, ''really bring you down to
earth.''

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A man muttering ''My savior, my
savior'' killed his 1{-year-old son by slamming him to the pavement
Friday, then swung the limp body at officers as they tried to
arrest him, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Hulum, 25, was taken to the state hospital for a
psychiatric evaluation. He was later charged with capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told police that Hulum left his apartment with the
child, Marquis, in his arms and twice smashed him to the ground in
the parking lot, police spokesman Terry Hastings said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm thinking he's playing with that child, but he's killing
him,'' said Anthony Farmer, 24. ''That baby didn't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   With the body slung over his shoulder, Hulum was confronted by
three police officers. Holding the child by one leg, Hulum swung
the body at the officers, hitting one in the head with it, before
being wrestled to the ground, police said. Police used pepper spray
to subdue him.
</P>
<P>
   Hulum had left his 4-year-old daughter behind in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The children's mother was at work at the time.

<HEADLINE> Denial of McVeigh Appeal Urged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Saying the legal system did not fail Timothy
McVeigh, federal prosecutors on Friday opposed his death row appeal
and request for new trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our legal system provided McVeigh a multimillion dollar
defense team to advocate his interests before an impartial judge
and jury selected far from the site of his deadly crime,'' Sean
Connelly, special attorney to the U.S. Attorney General wrote in a
brief filed in federal court Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In his second attempt to have his conviction and death sentence
overturned, McVeigh claimed his lawyer, Stephen Jones, failed to
provide adequate representation. McVeigh claims Jones leaked
inflammatory stories about him to the media, including a purported
confession, had a book deal in the works and had a conflict of
interest by becoming friends with Susan Ferrell's parents.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrell was one of 168 people killed in the April 19, 1995,
bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh also claimed some jurors were not honest in their
answers at jury selection and said the government suppressed
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly dismissed those claims in his argument.
</P>
<P>
   ''McVeigh sits on death row not because our legal system failed
him but rather because his guilt was proven fairly beyond any
reasonable doubt and his crime cried out for the ultimate
punishment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh lost his first appeal last year when the U.S. Supreme
Court refused to hear arguments that his trial was tainted by jury
misconduct and news reports that he confessed.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds ATM Surcharge Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The cities of Santa Monica and San
Francisco cannot enforce their bans on extra ATM fees while a
challenge to the laws is pending, a federal appeals court ruled
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a preliminary
injunction issued in November by U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker
against the fee-banning ordinances, passed by the City Council in
Santa Monica and voters in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he believes federal law bars local governments from
regulating ATM fees. The appellate panel said only that their
review of a preliminary injunction is very limited and that Walker
did not abuse his discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all banks impose extra charges on other banks' customers
who use their automated teller machines. The fees are as much as
$2.50 a transaction and come on top of any fees banks charge their
own customers.
</P>
<P>
   Banks say they need the surcharges to pay for expanding their
ATM networks. Consumer organizations that sponsored the bans, the
first in any U.S. cities, say the fees merely pad the profits of
banks that have been closing branches and laying off tellers.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinances were challenged in San Francisco federal court by
Wells Fargo and Bank of America, which control 86 percent of the
ATMs in the two cities. Both banks also closed their Santa Monica
ATMs to non-customers, and Bank of America took the same step in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the San Francisco vote, Walker ruled that banks
were likely to succeed in their legal challenge. The cities
appealed to the 9th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne said the city would not
appeal the ruling but would defend its ordinance when the case went
to trial before Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think federal law gives local voters the right to say that
banks can't provide one service and charge consumers twice for
it,'' Renne said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to the California Bankers Association and its
lawyer were not returned.

<HEADLINE> China-EU Talks End Without Deal  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's prospects for joining the World Trade
Organization this year suffered a setback Friday when talks with
the European Union ended without agreement. The EU is the most
important WTO member that still must sign off on China's bid to
join the group.
</P>
<P>
   Despite progress in four days of negotiations, EU Trade
Commissioner Pascal Lamy was leaving Beijing after deciding that a
final agreement ''was not possible at this stage,'' his spokesman,
Anthony Gooch, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years of trying, China has made joining the WTO this
year a priority. But this week's lack of agreement, even with the
intervention of Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, could slow China's
accession to the Geneva-based body that sets rules for global
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would give details on the sticking points. Gooch
said no date was set for future talks.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-nation EU is the most crucial of eight WTO members that
have still to sign off on China's WTO bid. A divided U.S. Congress
has watched the EU talks before deciding whether to signal its
approval for China's WTO entry by granting Beijing low-tariff trade
access permanently, shelving the current annual reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Gooch said the EU still hoped to see China join the WTO ''at the
earliest available opportunity.'' China's commitment to a deal with
the EU also remains ''as strong as it was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   China's official Xinhua News Agency confirmed that talks had
ended and said both sides had worked hard to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The talks are positive, constructive and fruitful,'' Xinhua
quoted the foreign trade ministry as saying. ''Both sides hope to
reach agreement as soon as possible, and the negotiations will
continue in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamy's Chinese counterpart, foreign trade minister Shi
Guangsheng, welcomed him to return to Beijing for more talks,
Xinhua said without proposing a date.
</P>
<P>
   Gooch said Lamy had shown ''significant flexibility during the
talks,'' and that both sides had made concessions ''resulting in a
certain narrowing of differences.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to make progress across the board,'' Gooch said. ''The
issues on the table are complex. They take time.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe wants greater access to China's automobile, insurance and
telecommunications markets and more licenses for insurers. Among
Europe's demands was reportedly that foreigners be allowed a
controlling 51 percent stake in telecommunications ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans had on Thursday given the Chinese proposals to
ponder overnight. The EU pullout after talks resumed Friday morning
showed that discrepancies were too great for the Europeans to stay
on in Beijing. Gooch said late Thursday that EU negotiators would
remain in Beijing ''as long as it's constructive.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks had opened amid optimism. Unlike two previous rounds
this year, EU Trade Commissioner Lamy led the delegation, a sign
negotiations were down to thorny political matters. Lamy met
Wednesday with the Chinese premier, another sign that both sides
were seeking breakthroughs.

Japanese Volcano Erupts Again
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- A day after it sent a spectacular blue-gray plume of
molten rock and ash billowing two miles above villages near Mount Usu, a volcano
in northern Japan erupted again. While ash dusted silent, evacuated villages,
there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries from either Friday's or
Saturday's eruption. Snow fell Friday evening and the military was called in
because of concerns over the possibility of landslides or mudslides caused by
melting runoff.

Putin Urges START II Ratification

   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin called Friday for the quick
ratification by Russia of the START II nuclear arms reduction treaty, an accord
that has been stalled for years by hard-liners and communists in parliament. It
was his first major policy statement since being elected. Putin also called on
parliament to make even deeper cuts in atomic missiles, a signal that he wants
good relations with the West after recent tensions and unpredictability under
Boris Yeltsin. Putin stopped short, however, of addressing the most sensitive
nuclear arms issue between Moscow and Washington -- the U.S. desire to modify
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

Delays Anger Elian's Father

   MIAMI (AP) -- A senior Cuban official today said Elian Gonzalez's father is
infuriated by the pace of efforts to reclaim his son as U.S. authorities delay a
deadline to revoke the Miami relatives' custody of the boy. The U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service determined on Jan. 5 that Juan Miguel Gonzalez should
be reunited with his son and was the only one who had the right to speak for
him. In Miami, Elian's relatives today said they would let the boy's father
visit him at their Little Havana home, but that they are no longer willing to
give the 6-year-old refugee to Juan Miguel Gonzalez if he comes to the United
States to await the outcome of their court appeal.

tragedy in Guyana as the worst modern-day cult-related mass killing. Ugandan
authorities promised to apprehend the perpetrators of the stabbings, burnings
and stranglings. But investigators showed no signs of being able to track down
sect leaders or even of being able to confirm which -- if any -- survived. The
government called a day of prayer Sunday.

Xerox To Cut 5,200 Jobs

   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Business machines giant Xerox Corp. said today it was
cutting 5,200 jobs, or 5 percent of its work force, saying it can ''no longer
operate business as usual and expect to win.'' Xerox said it was narrowing its
focus to two core markets: business machines such as copiers for home and
medium-sized offices, and larger documents systems for big corporations. In
1998, the company took a $1.1 billion charge and cut about 9,000 jobs in another

games left in me,'' Wilkens said. ''If they don't want me here, they'll have to
tell me that.'' Wilkens, 62, has two full seasons left on a five-year contract.
But the Hawks (26-45) have their worst record through 71 games since the
franchise moved to Atlanta in 1968.

<HEADLINE> Md. House Panel Approves Gun Bill  </HEADLINE>
By SETH HETTENA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- A measure that would make Maryland the
first state to require built-in locks on handguns breezed through a
House committee Friday, with members not changing so much as a
comma on the legislative session's most controversial bill.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 14-7 in favor of the bill, which would require
internal locks on all new handguns sold in Maryland, beginning in
2003.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which has already passed the Senate, is up for a
vote before the full House as early as Monday. If it passes without
amendments, the bill goes to the desk of Democratic Gov. Parris
Glendening, who is eager to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are making history in the state of Maryland,'' Glendening
said after the vote. He said the vote sent a strong message:
''Maryland will stand up to the NRA, Maryland will do what is
necessary to protect our children, Maryland will make our
communities safer and Maryland will set a new, national standard
for gun safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the bill prohibits anyone convicted of a
violent crime as a juvenile from possessing a handgun until age 30
and requires gun manufacturers to provide a ballistic fingerprint
of shell casings of all new guns. It also imposes five-year
mandatory minimum sentences on some convicted felons caught with a
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tried nine times Friday night to amend the bill,
which would have sent the measure back to the Senate, where
opponents might have been able to kill it with a filibuster. But
the six Republicans and lone Democrat who opposed the bill were
easily outnumbered by the rest of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the bill was flawed, pointing out that the
definition of a built-in gun lock was so vague that the safety
levers already found on most firearms would qualify. Some
supporters agreed, but said there was not enough time to fix the
problems, with little more than a week remaining in the 2000
legislative session.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Erupts Again in N. Japan  </HEADLINE>
By KOJI SASAHARA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- A volcano in northern Japan erupted again on
Saturday, a day after it roared to life and sent a spectacular
plume of molten rock and ash billowing two miles above the crater
and rolling down the snow-quilted slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Ash dusted silent, evacuated villages near Mount Usu following
the major eruption Friday afternoon, the mountain's first in 22
years. The only other noise came from sirens screaming warnings and
ambulances and police cars cruising in search of damage.
</P>
<P>
   Farther away from the volcano, people streamed into the streets
and climbed to rooftops to watch the towering cloud that blossomed
from the eruption. Some snapped photographs of debris that rose two
miles high for over two hours.
</P>
<P>
   But those in the nearby city of Date who weren't looking out a
window would barely have known that 2,416-foot Mount Usu was
erupting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't feel anything, I didn't hear anything,'' said
Norimichi Nagao, who works for the nearby city on Japan's
northernmost main island of Hokkaido. ''I didn't even know that
there was an eruption until I saw it on television.''
</P>
<P>
   The mountain erupted again before dawn Saturday, brightening the
sky and belching plumes of smoke for about 10 minutes, Japan's
meteorological agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The force of the second eruption wasn't immediately clear,
though officials said it was less powerful than Friday's.
</P>
<P>
   ''Volcanic activities are intensifying and even larger eruptions
than the previous ones are highly likely,'' agency spokesman
Toshimitsu Niibe said Saturday. ''We just don't know exactly how
soon that will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Niibe said it was not immediately possible to predict the next
major explosion, but urged residents and officials to stay alert.
''It could happen any time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of damage or injuries from either
eruption. But more than 11,000 people evacuated from communities at
Usu's base after the earth began rumbling earlier this week spent
Friday night in rescue centers.
</P>
<P>
   Snow fell Friday evening, increasing concerns about mudslides in
the lakeside resort area. The military was called in because of
concerns over the possibility of landslides or mudslides caused by
melting runoff. Two people were killed and 200 homes destroyed in
mudslides following Usu's last eruptions, which began in 1977 and
continued into the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Fears also remained that Usu could spew a deadly mix of gas and
rocks -- called a pyroclastic flow -- that races down slopes and
incinerates everything in its path.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said that evacuees might have to
stay for a while at makeshift centers set up in school gyms and
community halls. The government will consider building temporary
housing if that is the case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the centers, families sat on blankets spread out to mark
their private space. Some put up cardboard partitions, but there
was little else to give them any sense of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   About 51,000 people live in the coastal city of Date --
pronounced Dah-tay -- and several smaller towns near Usu, located
475 miles north of Tokyo. Experts had predicted the eruption
because of increased seismic activity that began earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   In Date, the eruption under clear blue skies became more of a
public spectacle than a threat. The somewhat relaxed atmosphere was
understandable: After days of small but constant earthquakes and
high-level warnings, many residents were ready.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the eruption, volcanic ash began to
rain down on nearby towns. Residents downwind were soon enveloped
by the pungent smell of sulfur.
</P>
<P>
   While Date was spared ashfall by winds that blew debris from the
eruption in the opposite direction, other places were not so lucky.
Cars coming in from other areas around the mountain were covered in
dust. Two other towns near Mount Usu, Abuta and Sobetsu, were
silent and empty, nearly all their residents evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Some area residents expressed a mixture of relief and anxiety
after the long-awaited eruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy I'm safe, but I'm afraid this will do huge damage to
my business,'' said 53-year-old scallop cultivator Yomiko Yasuko,
who was out at sea when the volcano erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most eruption-prone countries, with
86 active volcanoes.

''Brother Asaiah'' Bates
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOMER, Alaska (AP) -- ''Brother Asaiah'' Bates, who founded a
commune on Kachemak Bay and later was elected to city council, died
Monday of heart problems. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Bates said his World War II experience was the reason he devoted
himself to peace. He served in the South Pacific as a nose gunner
on a bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Bates found a messianic leader in California named Krishna Venta
who taught that mankind came to Earth in 12 rocket ships powered by
cosmic energy, that man has 110 interconnecting senses and that
one's negative thoughts are registered on the bodies of others.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Bates and other disciples established the Wisdom
Knowledge Faith Love commune at the head of Kachemak Bay. The
movement fizzled after Venta was killed by two excommunicated
followers in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Bates moved to Homer where he was elected to the Homer City
Council and joined the Chamber of Commerce. He became a janitor for
the phone company.

   BRISTOL, Tenn. (AP) -- Jay Baumgardner, a three-time Tennessee
senior amateur golf champion, died Thursday of an apparent heart
attack. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   Baumgardner was state senior amateur champion in 1993, 1994 and
1996 and was Tennessee Senior Amateur Player of the Year in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He was ranked as one of the top 10 senior amateur golfers in the

Gisele Freund
</P>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Gisele Freund, whose photographs captured the
attitudes of France's Left Bank literary elite, died Friday of a
heart attack. She was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Freund was one of Europe's most prominent photographers and
became a pillar among French feminist intellectuals after settling
in Paris in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   She met militant feminist writer Adrienne Monnier while browsing
at La Maison des Amis du Livre, Monnier's book shop on the Left
Bank. The shop was frequented by Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de
Beauvoir, James Joyce and Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   Monnier became her lifelong mentor and companion, introducing
her to the Parisian intellectual set and encouraging her to pursue
photography.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, Freund executed an acclaimed series of photographs
documenting the misery of British coal miners, and met Andre
Malraux. Her portrait of the author of ''Man's Fate'' -- wrapped in
a trench coat with a cigarette dangling from his mouth -- is among
her most well-known photographs.

<HEADLINE> Wizards 104, Celtics 102  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Mitch Richmond's 16-foot jumper with two-tenths of
a second left gave the Washington Wizards a 104-102 win and sent
the Boston Celtics to their sixth straight loss Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   After a free throw by Don Reid put the Wizards ahead 102-100,
Vitaly Potapenko tied the game with a turnaround jumper with 14
seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Whitney then brought the ball upcourt for Washington as
Richmond, who had 30 points, sprinted around to get free. He got
the ball on the left side and lofted the winning shot over Tony
Battie's raised left arm.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics inbounded the ball, but the buzzer sounded before
Paul Pierce could attempt a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Boston rebounded somewhat from its worst loss of the season,
122-87 in Orlando on Tuesday night, a setback marred by on-court
bickering among some of its players. Coach Rick Pitino said he
would make ''major suspensions'' but took no punitive action.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics never trailed Friday until Aaron Williams converted
an offensive rebound for a 95-94 Wizards lead with 5:55 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hamilton added 20 points for Washington, which has been
eliminated from playoff contention. Antoine Walker had 21 points
and 14 rebounds and Pierce added 18 points for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics fell to 30-42, assuring their third losing record in
Pitino's three seasons as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Boston suffered its third close loss in its current slide. In
the first two games, Anthony Peeler's 3-pointer at the buzzer gave
Minnesota a 109-106 win, and Aaron McKie's basket with no time left
in the first overtime sparked Philadelphia to a 117-115 victory.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing 97-96 with 4:34 left, the Celtics went ahead
100-97 on baskets by Walker and Battie. Then Juwan Howard hit a
foul-line jumper and a driving bank shot, putting the Wizards in
front 101-100 with 51 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had taken an 83-82 lead into the fourth quarter and went
ahead 94-91 on Dana Barros' 3-pointer. Then Washington took its
first lead on consecutive baskets by Reid and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing 60-46, the Wizards finished the half with an 11-2
surge with Richmond scoring the last five points on a 3-pointer and
two free throws. That cut Boston's lead to 62-57 at halftime. It
was down to 83-82 with one quarter left.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Boston had won five of its previous six home games. ...
Washington is 6-2 in its last eight games. ... On the final play,
Boston's first inbounds pass hit the backboard and went out of
bounds without anyone touching it. The officials then conferred at
midcourt as the Wizards headed for their locker room, and referee
Bennett Salvatore waved them back for a do-over.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Court Halts Oil Drilling  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A court on Friday ordered a halt to a
U.S. oil company's exploration near a Colombian Indian reservation,
in what appeared to be at least a temporary victory for the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Calderon, president of the state-owned Ecopetrol oil
company, said the government had notified Los Angeles-based
Occidental Petroleum Corp. of the order to suspend operations.
</P>
<P>
   Details on the Bogota circuit court verdict favoring the 8,000
member U'wa nation were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Calderon, whose company has contracts with Occidental, denounced
the verdict, saying it placed a small minority's interests above
those of the nation. The government plans to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a process in which if oil is found it could generate
nearly $900 million a year,'' Calderon told a news conference
Friday night. ''It's a project of enormous importance for the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   U'wa tribal leader Roberto Perez said the tribe still sees a
long battle ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a fight that's been won,'' he told The Associated
Press, speaking from Washington, where he has been meeting this
week with members of Congress and activists. ''But we've taken a
step forward and I feel content.''
</P>
<P>
   Occidental Corp. was unavailable for comment Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe has waged a national and international campaign since
1995 to stop the company from drilling on or near its ancestral
lands near Colombia's eastern border with Venezuela. At one point,
the group threatened mass suicide to highlight their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking compromise, the government last September approved a
nearly fourfold increase in the size of the tribal reservation, to
850 square miles stretching across four states.
</P>
<P>
   An exploratory drill site -- one Occidental and Colombian
officials hope will lead to reserves of as many as 2.5 billion
barrels of crude -- was approved a few miles outside the expanded
reservation.

Delays Anger Elian's Father
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A senior Cuban official today said Elian Gonzalez's father is
infuriated by the pace of efforts to reclaim his son. The U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service determined on Jan. 5 that Juan Miguel Gonzalez should be
reunited with Elian and was the only one who had the right to speak for him. But
the INS has twice moved back deadlines to revoke temporary custody of the
6-year-old refugee by Miami relatives pending more negotiations. In Miami,
Elian's relatives today said they would let Gonzalez visit him at their Little
Havana home, but that they are no longer willing to give the 6-year-old refugee
to his father if he comes to the United States to await the outcome of their
court appeal.

the semiautomatic handgun that the 6-year-old allegedly found and used to kill
Kayla on Feb. 29. James is charged with involuntary manslaughter; the 6-year-old

   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin called Friday for the quick

was his first major policy statement since being elected. Putin also called on
parliament to make even deeper cuts in atomic missiles, a signal that he wants
good relations with the West after recent tensions and unpredictability under
Boris Yeltsin. Putin stopped short, however, of addressing the most sensitive
nuclear arms issue between Moscow and Washington -- the U.S. desire to modify
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- The death toll in the doomsday sect massacre in

tragedy in Guyana as the worst modern-day cult-related mass killing. Ugandan
authorities promised to apprehend the perpetrators of the stabbings, burnings

preliminary injunction issued in November by U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker
against the fee-banning ordinances. Banks say they need the surcharges to pay
for expanding their ATM networks. Consumer organizations say the fees merely pad

win their seventh national championship. National player of the year Tamika
Catchings picked it up after scoring just two points in the first half and
freshman Kara Lawson hit two big shots to lead Tennessee (33-3) into Sunday

<HEADLINE> Women's Regionals May Be Revamped  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Those long days of regional competition in
the women's tournament -- and midnight starting times -- might be
ending soon.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA and ESPN, which has the television rights to the
tournament, are looking at playing the regionals over four days
instead of two.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the eight regional semifinals are played on one day.
The first game starts late in the morning and the last one tips off
at midnight EST. The four regional championship games are played on
Monday, starting in the early evening and finishing with another
midnight game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to look at that very carefully because neither you
nor we are satisfied that midnight starts are the best things for
us or the best things for the viewers,'' Len DeLuca, ESPN's senior
vice president for programming, said.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA women's basketball committee has expressed interest in
playing the regionals over four days, the way the men's tournament
is scheduled. Under that format, there would be no more than four
games on one day.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN has the contract for the women's tournament through the
2001-2002 season. DeLuca said the network is willing to discuss the
four-day regional setup when negotiations for the next contract
begin.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ready to discuss all options,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   HOME SWEET HOMECOMING: Kristen Clement, a native of nearby
Broomall, hit her first three shots and scored eight of Tennessee's
first 10 points as the Lady Vols advanced to the national
championship with a 64-54 victory over Rutgers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clement made a 3-pointer from the top of the arc and a
long-range jumper and a 3-pointer from the wing as the Lady Vols
took a 10-5 lead 5:59 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Clement did not take another shot until midway through the
second half. She went to the bench after committing her second foul
6:38 into the game and did not play the rest of the first half. She
finished with eight points.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just having fun,'' Clement said. ''Coach told me not to
try and force things, to relax and have fun and that's what I did.
It felt great. I was more concerned with getting my team
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   BITTERSWEET HOMECOMING: Shawnetta Stewart, a Philadelphia
native, led Rutgers with 11 points and eight rebounds. She fouled
out with 1:01 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very disappointed,'' said Stewart, who was 5-of-15 from
the floor. ''I'm glad my team got to this point and I got to
experience this in my hometown. I just wish we could've gone
further.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   WHERE HAVE THEY GONE: Hillary Howard played in the national
championship game last season as the point guard for Duke, which
lost to Purdue. Howard was back in the Final Four this year,
covering the games as a reporter for an Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's different. I'd rather be out there playing,'' Howard
said. ''I'm sure I'll be a little antsy.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard planned on continuing her career playing overseas in
Germany or Italy, but a stress fracture in her left foot forced her
''to find a job.'' Though she majored in history, the transition to
sportswriting wasn't difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a new experience, but my sports background helps,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: The crowd of 20,060 was the largest to ever attend a
college basketball game in Pennsylvania. The previous high was
19,372 for a Villanova-Notre Dame men's game in February 1997. . .
The NCAA issued 669 credentials for the women's Final Four, most
ever in the history of the tournament, officials said. The number
exceeds the amount issued for the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals and the
1998 U.S. Figure Skating Championships at the First Union Center.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes 3, Sabres 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Paul Coffey's power-play goal with 7:34
left lifted the Carolina Hurricanes to a 3-1 victory over the
Buffalo Sabres on Friday night and into a tie for eighth place in
the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Hill sealed the win, scoring into an open net with 4.9
seconds remaining. Paul Ranheim also scored for the Hurricanes, who
jumped ahead of the Sabres in the standings and caught the idle
Montreal Canadiens in the race for the conference's final playoff
berth.
</P>
<P>
   Vaclav Varada scored for the Sabres, who had a four-game winning
streak come to an end. After averaging more than four goals in
their last seven games, the Sabres managed only 20 shots -- six in
the final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes have four games left, including a season-ending
home-and-home series against the expansion Atlanta Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres have five games left, starting with Saturday's game
at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey carried the puck into the Sabres zone and, using Buffalo
defenseman Richard Smehlik as a screen, wristed a low shot that
deflected in off goalie Dominik Hasek's stick.
</P>
<P>
   The goal came with Varada in the penalty box for interference,
the Hurricanes' seventh power-play opportunity of the game, and
fourth straight called against the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Varada, with his season-high eighth goal, opened the scoring
deflecting in Rhett Warrener's point shot over goalie Arturs Irbe's
shoulder 32 seconds into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes replied at the 11:41 mark when Hasek misplayed
Bates Battaglia's shot from a poor angle. Hasek allowed the puck to
deflect off his stick and into the crease, allowing Ranheim to
stuff it in.
</P>
<P>
   For Ranheim, it was his ninth goal of the season and first in 27
games.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek made up for it three minutes later when, without his
stick, he blocked Paul Coffey's hard shot and then managed to knock
down Andrei Kovalenko's chip-in attempt from in close.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres, meanwhile, hit two goal posts, including Varada who
beat Irbe through the legs only to have the puck ring off then far
right post with 9:15 left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Sabres' Doug Gilmour had a seven-game point streak snapped, the
first time he's failed to record at least a point since joining
Buffalo in a deal with Chicago. Despite battling a stomach virus,
which has caused him to lose seven pounds, Gilmour played a regular
shift.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes were missing All-Star Sami Kapanen, who missed
his second game because of concussion-like symptoms.

<HEADLINE> 17 injured as casino-bound minibus rear-ends truck on Garden StateParkway  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALLOWAY TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- Seventeen people were injured
Friday when a minibus taking gamblers to an Atlantic City casino
rear-ended a truck on the Garden State Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   Two were hospitalized in critical condition. The others suffered
minor injuries, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   The wreck shut down a four-mile section of the parkway for about
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucky Strike Travel Service Inc. minibus, with 17 people
aboard, left from New York's Chinatown section and was bound for
Bally's Park Place Casino Hotel when the accident occurred about 10
miles northwest of Atlantic City, Trooper Barry Saul said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Guang Zhi Chi, 29, of Brooklyn, N.Y., told police
that he was in the right lane on the southbound side of the parkway
when he pulled out to pass a slower-moving vehicle, Saul said.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling between 60 mph and 70 mph, the minibus rammed the rear
of a P.J. Gillespie Inc. concrete products truck in the left lane.
Truck driver Michael Colaneri, 61, of Millville and passenger
Robert Diaz, age unavailable, of Millville, suffered minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The speed limit on that section of the parkway is 65 mph. Police
did not know how fast the truck was traveling.
</P>
<P>
   The gamblers were mostly in their 60s and 70s, but one was 17
years old.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were all over the floor, screaming, making all sorts of
noises,'' said the 17-year-old, who was treated for minor injuries
at Atlantic City Medical Center's Mainland Division. ''Smoke was
coming out of the front of the bus. It was crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwai Chan, 70, of New York, was listed in critical condition at
Atlantic City Medical Center. Another bus passenger, Cabiano Pineda
Jr., 60, of Long Island, also was in critical condition, a
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Chi, whose air bag deployed, was unhurt. One passenger declined
medical treatment. Chi will be cited either for careless driving,
following too closely or making an unsafe lane change, Saul said.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the crash ripped the front section of the 24-seat
minibus off and shattered the windshield. Clothing, shoes, hunks of
metal and glass were strewn about the accident scene.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic backed up for more than two miles as State Police,
ambulance crews, firetrucks and a State Police helicopter tended to
the victims and cleaned up the highway.
</P>
<P>
   A Lucky Strike official defended his driver.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very reliable,'' said Charlie Lee, assistant manager at
Lucky Strike Travel Service Inc., of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Chi had been driving for the company for about four years and
had had one previous accident recently, but no one was hurt in it,
Lee said. The status of his New York license wasn't clear Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Motor Vehicles had no record for Chi's name,
as spelled by New Jersey State Police and his Lucky Strike
supervisor. But a man named Zhi Juang Cai, also of Brooklyn, N.Y.,
and with the same June 28, 1970 birthday, has a valid commercial
driver's license despite a 1998 conviction for running a red light,
Motor Vehicles spokesman Joseph Picchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Strike operates up to a dozen round-trip excursions a day
between Chinatown and Bally's Park Place Casino Hotel in Atlantic
City, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The truck's rear window was broken, but it suffered little
visible damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not a lot of damage to it, but boy, that bus is
totaled,'' said Dennis Gillespie, whose father owns it, as he
surveyed the damage at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first serious accident involving a bus bound for an
Atlantic City casino this year, according to Sgt. Al Della Fave, a
spokesman for the State Police. The number of crashes this year was
not immediately available Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a rash of accidents involving casino buses in 1998
and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 24, 1998, eight people were killed when a Bruins
Transportation bus skidded off the parkway and plunged down an
embankment. Three days later, a bus returning to New York lost
control in Edison and struck a tree, injuring 31 people.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, a bus hit a bridge abutment on the Garden State
Parkway in Wall Township, injuring 11 people.

<HEADLINE> Priest To Stand Trial in Bishop Case  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A judge refused Friday to dismiss charges
against a Roman Catholic priest accused in the 1998 slaying of
human rights campaigner Bishop Juan Gerardi, opening the way for a
trial in Guatemala's most infamous murder case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Flor de Maria Garcia rejected a motion from the defense to
dismiss the arrest warrant against Mario Orantes. A date for his
trial has not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have now completed all of the steps necessary to finally
bring criminal proceedings against the Reverend Orantes,'' said
Leopaldo Zeissig, who is heading the Public Ministry's
investigation of Orantes, who was the slain bishop's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Head of the Roman Catholic Church's human rights office in
Guatemala, the 65-year-old Gerardi was bludgeoned to death with a
concrete block in April 1998 in the garage of the seminary where he
and Orantes lived and worked.
</P>
<P>
   His death came two days after he presented an encyclopedic
report that blamed the Guatemalan military for an overwhelming
majority of the 200,000 killings during Guatemala's 36-year civil
war. The conflict, which pitted leftist, mostly Indian guerrillas
against government forces ended in a 1996 peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Orantes, 41, is hospitalized with undisclosed back and nervous
system problems.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the slaying, authorities arrested Orantes, who
told police he was napping at the time of Gerardi's death but
stumbled upon his body in the seminary's garage.
</P>
<P>
   He spent seven months in prison on murder charges but was
released and allowed to travel to Houston to seek medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Toledo, Orantes chief attorney, said after the ruling that
his client was a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am absolutely, categorically sure that it was not Orantes
because I have looked at the evidence the prosecutors have
presented,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> School Shooting Suspect Enters Plea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- A teen-ager pleaded not guilty by reason of
insanity Friday to charges that he wounded six of his high school
classmates during a shooting spree in May.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, lawyers for T.J. Solomon acknowledged that he
opened fire with a .22-caliber rifle, wounding six Heritage High
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have never disputed that the shots were fired by Mr.
Solomon,'' defense attorney Jana Harris said earlier this month.
''The depths of his illness, the circumstances surrounding the case
-- these are the things that will be looked at the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   A trial is scheduled for June 15, but is likely to be postponed
for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, who has been in juvenile detention since his arrest,
could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted on all counts. If
a jury found Solomon not guilty by reason of insanity, he could be
institutionalized or freed.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Solomon, 15 at the time of the shooting, opened
fire in a crowded hall area at Heritage, exactly one month after
the rampage in Littleton, Colo., that left 14 students and a
teacher dead.

<HEADLINE> Devils 6, Thrashers 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Scott Gomez had a goal and two
assists as the New Jersey Devils ended a two-game losing streak
with a 6-0 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The win boosted the slumping Devils -- 7-12-2 in their last 21
games -- back into sole possession of first place in the Eastern
Conference with 99 points. The Thrashers, who have lost five in a
row, are winless in their last seven and have just one victory in
their last 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took a 1-0 lead 1:44 into the game when Colin White's
shot from inside the blue line sailed past Atlanta's Damian Rhodes.
It was White's second goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The play started with Bobby Holik digging the puck out from
behind the Thrashers net and passing it to Claude Lemieux, who was
just inside the blue line on the right side. Lemieux's cross ice
pass left White with a clear shot.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur protected the lead with three acrobatic saves
within a 12- second stretch midway through the period.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey made it 2-0 on a power play goal by Gomez at 6:13 of
the second period. It was the 19th goal of the season for the
rookie center.
</P>
<P>
   Before the period was over the Devils led 4-0 on John Madden's
16th goal and Petr Sykora's 25th. Krzysztof Oliwa and Brodeur had
assists on Madden's goal while Patrik Elias and Jason Arnott picked
up assists on Sykora's score, which came on another power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils added another at 7:06 of the third period as Sergei
Brylin converted passes from Scott Stevens and Gomez for his eighth
goal, while Stevens scored his seventh on assists from Gomez and
Alexander Mogilny 3{ minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur finished with 22 saves in recording his sixth shutout of
the year and 42nd of his career.

<HEADLINE> Helms Likely To Get UN Invite Again  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- After swapping visits with members of the
U.N. Security Council, Sen. Jesse Helms is likely to get another
invitation to New York to continue the new dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the conservative North Carolina Republican is one of
the harshest critics of the United Nations, Security Council
members believe the two meetings have started the long process of
improving Washington's frayed relationship with the world body.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh's U.N. Ambassador Anwarul Chowdhury, the current
council president, told a news conference Friday that all 15
council members found the exchange of views at Thursday's meeting
in Washington to be important.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought that this is a good beginning. The senators are
interested in continuing this dialogue. They're interested in
visiting us. They are interested also in receiving us again from
time to time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is ... a willingness to receive them here in the
near future,'' Chowdhury said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's visit to the Capitol didn't resolve the dispute over
U.S. arrears to the United Nations -- which the United Nations says
now total $1.7 billion. And at a 2{-hour roundtable, ambassador
after ambassador criticized a host of Helms-mandated conditions the
world body must meet before Washington pays up.
</P>
<P>
   But many U.N. envoys said the mood Thursday were better than
that during the first meeting in January when Helms addressed the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the mood shift is significant,'' British Ambassador
Jeremy Greenstock said. ''The substance shift is not yet there --
but one thing leads to another.''

   Teen-ager Found Guilty of Second-Degree Murder
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The teenage girl charged with
killing 14-year-old Reena Virk was found guilty of second-degree
murder Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Ellard's mouth dropped open and she began crying quietly
after she heard the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother began sobbing as Ellard wiped tears away with her
sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   The British Columbia Supreme jury began deliberating Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Virk's murder stunned the country and sparked numerous debates
about female teen violence.
</P>
<P>
   During two weeks of testimony the court heard from 10 teenagers
who said Ellard, 17, bragged about the killing in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ellard denied any part in the killing when she testified. She
had only met Virk that night and had no reason to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   Ellard is the last of eight teens to go to trial for Virk's
death.
Judge Grants Robert Baltovich Bail Pending Appeal
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Robert Baltovich emerged from prison Friday on a
quest to officially join the growing ranks of Canada's wrongfully
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Shrieks of joy echoed in the courthouse halls as appeal court
Justice Marc Rosenberg granted the 34-year-old's request for bail
pending the appeal of his 1992 conviction in the murder of his
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, eight years to the day after he was first convicted
of killing Elizabeth Bain, Baltovich was greeted warmly by
applauding friends and family as he strolled out of custody.
</P>
<P>
   Baltovich then made his way down busy University Avenue to the
offices of lawyer James Lockyer, who will spend the next year
preparing his client's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   There have been at least six high-profile cases of wrongful
conviction in recent years, including Guy Paul Morin, David
Milgaard and Donald Marshall.
Ken Murray Trial Will Start
</P>
<P>
   ST. CATHARINES, Ontario (AP) -- The trial of Ken Murray, one-time
lawyer for sex killer Paul Bernardo, on obstruction of justice
charges will go ahead despite his lawyer's arguments that the
matter took too long to get to court.
</P>
<P>
   Murray closed his eyes and shook his head as Justice Patrick
Gravely ruled he did not face an unreasonable delay in the 38
months it took for the case, dealing with his handling of the
notorious Bernardo tapes, to get to trial. Murray held on to the
tapes for 17 months before handing them over to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally, everything that could be done was done in moving
this case expeditiously to trial,'' Gravely told Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's lawyer, Austin Cooper, had argued to have the charges
dropped, saying Murray's constitutional rights were infringed
because of the delay.
Prime Minister Chretien Announces 900 Call Center Jobs
</P>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien swooped
into hard-luck Cape Breton Friday, announcing up to 900 call center
jobs thanks in part to a $13-million contribution from the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is patronage at its best,'' said the prime minister,
brushing aside criticism that the package is an attempt to buy
votes in a region where the federal Liberals have no
representation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take public money to make sure it is going in areas where
it is needed. And those who will benefit are the people of Cape
Breton.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chretien acknowledged that won't affect hundreds of coal
miners who are facing the loss of their jobs when Ottawa gets out
of the coal business later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The impending shutdown of the Cape Breton Development Corp., or
Devco, has provoked emotional demonstrations for more than a year.
Canadians Will Have Extra 24 Hours To File Tax Returns
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Canadians will have an extra 24 hours to file
their income tax returns on time.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline has been extended to midnight on May 1 instead of
April 30, which is a Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Many Revenue offices will be open until midnight that day, said
Revenue Minister Martin Cauchon, and some postal outlets.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Ron Mercer scored 22 points and all five
Orlando starters reached double figures as the Magic beat the New
Jersey Nets for the first time this season, 103-97 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the sixth straight for the Magic, giving them a
two-game lead over Milwaukee in the race for the eighth playoff
spot in the East. New Jersey, in 10th place in the conference,
dropped 5 1-2 games behind Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic have won 16 of their last 18 at home. The Nets had won
the previous three meetings between the teams this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Outlaw, who had a triple-double in his previous game,
finished with 16 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. John
Amaechi scored 17, Ben Wallace had 11 points and 14 rebounds and
Darrell Armstrong had 11 points and nine assists. Orlando shot 50.6
percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey was led by Kendall Gill with 21 points. Starters
Keith Van Horn, who had 20 points, and Stephon Marbury, who had
seven, shot a combined 10-of-36.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic used an 8-0 run late in the fourth quarter to lead,
96-84. New Jersey got back in the game when Kerry Kittles hit a
3-pointer with 28.2 seconds remaining to make it 100-94. After
Amstrong hit a free throw, Van Horn responded with two to make it
101-96, but there was little time remaining for much more of a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey shot 43.7 percent and was only 4-for-17 from 3-point
range.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando built its lead to 69-59 at the 6:16 mark of the third
quarter. But New Jersey cut it to 77-73 at the end of the quarter
on a jumper by Johnny Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer hit seven of 11 field goals to lead all scorers with 14
points as Orlando led 60-50 at the half. Outlaw's layup with 3:46
remaining tied the game at 44 and from there the Magic finished the
half on a 16-6 run. Gill and Van Horn had 10 points each for New
Jersey, which only made two of 10 3-point attempts in the half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: New Jersey's Jim McIlvaine did not travel with the team
because of a bulging disk in his lower back. It was the fourth
consecutive game McIlvaine missed. ... Outlaw's 16 points were a
season high.

<HEADLINE> Arizona's Williams To Have Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- All-Star third baseman Matt Williams will undergo
surgery Saturday to have a metal plate placed in his broken right
foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Diamondbacks said the surgery would not alter the
timetable for Williams' recovery and will allow him to do
conditioning work, such as riding a stationary bicycle or other
activity that requires him to put weight on the foot, before the
break is healed.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery will be performed by team foot specialist Peter
Mitchell and team physician David Zeman.
</P>
<P>
   Williams broke the second metatarsal when he fouled a pitch off
the foot Tuesday in an exhibition game against Seattle in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to miss at least the first five weeks of the
season. Williams broke the same bone in 1995 and was sidelined for
68 games. However, that was a displaced break that required surgery
to insert pins in the bone. Williams has said that he tried to come
back too soon from that injury, and ended up fracturing the bone
again.

<HEADLINE> Boston's Pena Out With Hurt Elbow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Promising young right-hander Juan Pena will be
lost for the season with a torn medial collateral ligament in his
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Pena was sent to Boston from Florida on Thursday after
experiencing pain in the elbow during pre-game warmups. Team
physician William Morgan confirmed the torn MCL in an examination
Friday and said surgery would be required.
</P>
<P>
   The rehabilitation is expected to take 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old pitcher was told by manager Jimy Williams on
Wednesday that he would not be in the starting rotation but would
be a long-inning reliever. Brian Rose beat out Pena for the fifth
starting spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox believe that the injury occurred when Pena was
struck by Sean Casey's line drive on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pena was 2-0 in two starts with an 0.69 ERA for Boston last
season after being called up from Triple-A Pawtucket. This spring,
Pena was 2-2 with a 1.64 ERA in 16 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Pena's spot in the bullpen is expected to be taken by
27-year-old right-hander Nerio Rodriguez, who was claimed on
waivers from the New York Mets. Rodriguez has a career 4-6 record
in the majors with a 6.49 ERA in stints with Baltimore and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Rodriguez was 10-8 with a 4.54 ERA in 27 starts for
Triple-A Syracuse. He was 0-1 with a 13.50 ERA in two relief
appearances for Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Panthers 3, Senators 1  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Mike Vernon stopped 32 shots and won his
fifth consecutive start Friday night as the Florida Panthers beat
Ottawa 3-1, handing the Senators their fifth loss in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, winners of five of their last seven, are three
points ahead of Ottawa for the fifth playoff spot in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon was the difference in Florida's first win in four tries
against Ottawa this season. He stopped 11 shots in the first
period, 10 in the second and 11 in the third, including several
from point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers had plenty of turnovers, giving Ottawa numerous
chances, but the 37-year-old goaltender -- fifth in career playoff
wins with 77 -- appeared ready for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers led 1-0 after the first period. They scored in the
ninth minute when Len Barrie netted his eighth goal of the season,
a slap shot from just inside the right circle that beat Tom
Barrasso.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa tied the game in the second on Daniel Alfredsson's 18th
goal. He took a pass from Petr Schastlivy, skated around defender
Mike Wilson and cut sharply to the front of the net, where he
slipped a wrist shot past Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers regained the lead with a power-play goal in the
final minutes of the second period, when Ray Whitney found Pavel
Bure just outside the crease. Bure's shot rebounded off Barrasso
and the puck bounced around in front of the net until Ray Sheppard
tipped it in off a defenseman's skate at the 18:39 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was Sheppard's eighth, and the assist extended Bure's
consecutive points streak to 10 games on his 29th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Kozlov gave the Panthers, who improved to 29-2-2 when
leading after two periods, a 3-1 lead with 5:28 to play.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-on-four situation, Kozlov skated across the blue line,
cut toward the right circle and ripped a shot past Barrasso for his
17th goal.

<HEADLINE> Suns 98, Pistons 97  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Cliff Robinson hit the game-winning
jumper with 14 seconds left and blocked Grant Hill's last shot as
the Phoenix Suns held off the Detroit Pistons 98-97 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson finished with 20 points, Penny Hardaway had 15 points,
a season-best 12 assists and eight rebounds, and reserve Rodney
Rogers added 17 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for the
Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Hill scored a game-high 28 points, including 13 in the
fourth quarter, and Jerry Stackhouse added 19. But Hill and
Stackhouse combined to make just 13 of 41 shots from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The score was 93-93 when Rogers floated in a 3-pointer as the
shot clock expired to put Phoenix ahead with 1:34 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Hunter hit two free throws for Detroit, and after the
Suns' Randy Livingston missed a baseline runner, Stackhouse hit two
from the line to put the Pistons up 97-96 with 27.6 seconds to
play.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, Robinson hit a turnaround jumper to put the
Suns back in front. Robinson then swatted away Hill's attempt to
win the game. Detroit's Jerome Williams grabbed the ball, but his
desperation shot was blocked by Oliver Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix led by as many as 10 points in the second quarter, and
held a 51-44 edge at the break. Robinson led the way with 14 on
5-for-7 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons used a 9-2 run to get within 57-55 early in the
third, but the Suns scored the next seven points -- with Hardaway
getting five -- to move the margin back to nine.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons scored the final four points of the period, getting
them within 72-66 with one quarter to go.
</P>
<P>
   Hill scored eight points in the first three minutes of the
fourth, and Stackouse then reeled off five straight points to give
Detroit a 79-78 edge with seven minutes left. The last basket of
the run was a 3-pointer that hit the rim, bounced twice off the top
edge of the backboard, then dropped through the net.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Detroit guard Michael Curry played briefly despite
spraining his ankle in Wednesday's loss to Charlotte, and Hill
stayed in the game after reaggravating a foot injury. Phoenix
temporarily lost Robinson in the third after he twisted his ankle
after coming down on Hill's foot. ... Kevin Johnson (sore
hamstring) was not in uniform for Phoenix. ... Phoenix won 12 games
in March, its highest one-month total since winning 12 in March

<HEADLINE> Man Stowed Away Aboard Flight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A man hid in the cargo hold of a Northwest
Airlines flight Friday and traveled more than 2,000 miles to
Memphis, Tenn., where he fled into the terminal and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The stowaway settled into the heated and pressurized front
section of the cargo hold, where pets are kept, as Flight 946 left
Seattle on Friday morning, KIRO-TV reported.
</P>
<P>
   On arrival in Memphis, he asked baggage handlers for a ride to
the terminal, KIRO reported. When the handlers challenged him, he
fled.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't anticipate that there will be a person when you open
the cargo door,'' said Minneapolis-based Northwest spokeswoman
Kathy Peach, who said the man appeared to be in his late 20s.
</P>
<P>
   The man's identity is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration and Seattle port police were
investigating, said Scott Ingham, a Northwest spokesman in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA here referred questions to a suburban Atlanta facility,
where a person who answered the phone Friday evening said FAA
involvement was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Port of Seattle, which operates the
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, said how the man got to the
plane is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very interested in learning how this individual got onto
the airfield,'' spokesman Bob Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis Airport police referred calls to Northwest.

Delays Anger Elian's Father
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father is infuriated by the pace of efforts to
reclaim his son as U.S. authorities delay a deadline to revoke the Miami
relatives' custody of the boy, a senior Cuban official said today. The INS has
twice moved back deadlines to revoke the relative's temporary custody pending
more negotiations. In Miami, Elian's relatives today said they would let
Gonzalez visit him at their Little Havana home, but that they are no longer
willing to give the 6-year-old refugee to his father if he comes to the United
States to await the outcome of their court appeal.

preliminary hearing for Jamelle James, 19, who is accused of carelessly storing
the semiautomatic handgun that the 6-year-old allegedly found and used to kill
Kayla on Feb. 29. James is charged with involuntary manslaughter; the 6-year-old

Tensions Rise Over Zimbabwe Farms
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Civic groups and opposition parties were warned by
police Friday to call off a scheduled peace march as tensions worsened here over
black war veterans' occupation of white-owned farmland. The unrest began in
February, when veterans armed with spears, axes, clubs and guns smashed their
way into white farmers' homesteads and seized their spreads. President Robert
Mugabe has called the occupation a justifiable political protest against the
descendants of white settlers who ruled here during the colonial era. Police
have refused to evict the squatters.

Farmers Shy Away From Biotech Crops

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers are turning away from genetically engineered

Plantings of the gene-altered corn are projected to drop 24 percent this year,
according to findings of an Agriculture Department survey released Friday. The
biotech corn became especially controversial last year after a Cornell

<HEADLINE> Hornets 110, Raptors 101, OT  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Anthony Mason scored a career-high 31
points and had his second triple-double in the last three games to
lead the Charlotte Hornets to a 110-101 overtime victory Friday
night over the slumping Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   Mason also had 14 rebounds and a season-high 11 assists. The
Hornets scored eight straight points in overtime to clinch their
fifth straight win and overtake Toronto for fifth place in the
East.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones of the Hornets led all scorers with 32 points.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter scored 31 points for the Raptors, who have lost six
of their last seven games and now trail the Hornets by a half-game
in the standings. He hit 12 of 30 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Mason was the star of the game but also missed a last-second
shot that would have won it for the Hornets in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Jones got the Hornets started in the overtime period with a
jumper from the corner. After Carter tied it with a jumper, Mason
got the Hornets started on the 8-0 run to seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   After Charles Oakley fouled him, Mason hit both free throws.
David Wesley followed that with a jumper and the Raptors never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy McGrady scored 16 points for Toronto and Kevin Willis
added 14.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley had 18 points for the Hornets, who shot 49 percent from
the field but were outrebounded 45-40.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The marquee matchup was a sellout at the Charlotte
Coliseum, where paid attendance has averaged about 17,500. ...
Jones was quoted in news reports as saying that the club's
uncertain arena future will be a factor when he decides whether to
re-sign with Charlotte or pursue free agency. ... Hornets forward
Derrick Coleman did not play because of an inflamed knee. ... The
Raptors have lost nine of their last 11 games with Charlotte,
including the last five in Charlotte.

<HEADLINE> Massachusetts Bans Computer Dumping  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- With electronic equipment becoming obsolete at an
increasingly rapid rate, Massachusetts is instituting the nation's
first ban on the disposal of computer screens, TV sets and other
glass picture tubes in landfills and incinerators.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental officials say they are trying to head off a flood
of potentially toxic electronic junk.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good public health and environmental move,'' said John
McNabb, solid waste policy director at Clean Water Action of New
England. ''We hope that it is replicated nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations take effect Saturday and mean individuals
can no longer simply throw their computers and TV sets in the
trash.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the state is setting up six collection centers to
handle the items, and cities and towns must transport the items to
those centers. From there, they will either be refurbished or sent
on for recycling.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the new regulations is cathode ray tubes, which is
the technical name for the glowing screens used in televisions and
computer monitors. The average cathode ray tube contains 5 to 8
pounds of lead that can seep into the groundwater under landfills
or, if the tube is incinerated, get into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fowley of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's New
England office said it is already illegal throughout the country
for businesses to throw their computers in the trash, but
Massachusetts has broken new ground by barring individuals from
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the federal level, we don't regulate homeowners. However,
we encourage the states to put in appropriate additional
restrictions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the regulation focuses on the CRTs, Massachusetts
environmental officials say they expect people to recycle the
entire computer. And they are happy about that, because computers'
printed circuit boards can also contain toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   A major wave of electronics trash is being forecast nationwide
in coming years as people buy newer, cheaper computers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pressure's on to get the latest model and the prices are
getting so low,'' McNabb said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-based, nonprofit National Safety Council has
estimated that 20.6 million personal computers became obsolete in
1998 alone, with about a quarter of them being thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Waste management officials are also worried that millions of
people may buy new TVs when television networks switch to digital
transmission signals later this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, business, government and other officials are
searching for answers to the electronics junk problem through the
EPA-financed Electronic Product Recovery and Recycling Roundtable.
</P>
<P>
   Some activists and public officials, while welcoming government
recycling efforts, have argued that companies should be responsible
for taking their products back once they have become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   But Alec Rosen, a spokesman for Apple Computer Inc., said: ''I
don't think that's realistic. It's about as realistic as Detroit
being responsible for taking cars back.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested people donate their used computers to schools or
charities.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of them would love to take a good computer off of
someone's hands,'' he said. ''There are a lot of good uses for old
computers, Macs and PCs.''

<HEADLINE> Jazz 114, Warriors 97  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone scored 22 points and John
Stockton was in classic form, scoring 15 points and handing out
nine assists as the Utah Jazz beat the Golden State Warriors 114-97
on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hornacek scored 16 points, reserve Armen Gilliam added 11
and Olden Polynice had 10 as the Jazz had no difficulty dispatching
the punchless Warriors, who lost their eighth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State cut its deficit to 89-78 with 28.3 seconds left in
the third quarter when Mookie Blaylock scored after a scramble for
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But Stockton, whose deliberate work at point guard helped him
become the NBA's career steals and assists leader, gave Utah its
15th straight victory over Golden State with a keen sense of court
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton worked the clock at the other end before hitting a
jumper in the lane with 3.1 seconds to go. Then, he intercepted the
ball when Donyell Marshall threw a lazy inbounds pass to Larry
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton's flip over Marshall's arms came with seven-tenths of a
second on the clock and gave the Jazz a 93-78 lead entering the
final period. From there, the lead never fell below double digits.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes scored 27 points for the Warriors. Marshall had 18 points
and 16 rebounds while Blaylock scored 16 and Jason Caffey had 10.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was involved for the Jazz on both ends, and Utah coach
Jerry Sloan gave his reserves plenty of playing time. The Warriors,
on the other hand, usually looked to Hughes and nobody else.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Ostertag blocked six shots as the Jazz held Golden State to
36 percent shooting (33-of-91). Utah also hit 31-of-36 from the
free-throw line, led by NBA leader Hornacek, who went 4-of-4.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sloan said he and Malone cleared up differences stemming
from an argument Wednesday during the Philadelphia game. Malone
became upset after being called to the bench. ... The Warriors went
1-16 in March. ... Polynice, a 25 percent free-throw shooter, made
his first four. ... Seven of Utah's 11 remaining regular-season
games are on the road, beginning Saturday night in Denver.

<HEADLINE> China Bars Woman From Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- The widow of noted American journalist Edgar Snow
tried Saturday to deliver money and a book to a woman whose son was
killed during the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, but authorities
barred the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Snow attempted to meet Ding Zilin at her home inside the
People's University in Beijing, but school security officials
turned her away at the campus gate, saying she couldn't come in
without permission.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the campus, around a dozen security agents prevented
Ding, a retired professor, from leaving her home, said a friend of
Ding's who came to meet Snow at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, 79, of Switzerland, visited China with her husband before
his death in 1972 and returned regularly afterward. However, until
her arrival Friday, she had stayed away from the communist nation
in recent years because of her disgust with the 1989 crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Snow's decision to come to China to meet Ding presented
authorities with an embarrassing challenge because Edgar Snow is
greatly respected in China for his reporting of the Communist
Party's struggle to take power.
</P>
<P>
   Snow gained acclaim for his interviews with Mao Tse-Tung and
other leaders when they were still fighting a guerrilla war and his
writing drew international attention to China's then-struggling
communist movement. The communists succeeded in overthrowing the
Nationalists in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Ding has led a 10-year campaign to try and persuade authorities
to apologize for the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators,
in which hundreds or possibly thousands were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Ding has collected the names of victims and distributed money to
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Because she was unable to meet Ding in person, Snow gave a book
of photos taken by her husband as well as an envelope of money and
a statement of support to the friend who met her, Su Bingxian, who
also lost a son in the protests.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Rdp  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   It looks like the Tampa Bay Devil Rays will have to
wait to see
the results of a busy offseason of moves.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Devil Rays placed ace Wilson Alvarez on the disabled list
Friday with shoulder tendinitis, and new third baseman Vinny
Castilla is also expected to start the season on the DL with a
strained abdominal muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frustrating,'' Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild said.
''There's nothing I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild should be used to it. Last season, the Devil Rays put
a major league-high 18 players on the disabled list. They are
already at two, with third baseman Damian Rolls joining Alvarez on
the DL on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The injury list keeps growing, as Esteban Yan left Friday's game
against Detroit in St. Petersburg, Fla., after two innings with a
right foreman bruise. He was hit by a liner off the bat of
Detroit's Juan Encarnacion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's muscle, so there's no bone involved,'' Rothschild said.
''It got a little puffed up after getting hit. He should be OK, but
we'll see.'
</P>
<P>
   Juan Guzman, bothered by a sore shoulder, might be replaced by
Dave Eiland as the Devil Rays' home opener starter on April 7
against Cleveland. A final decision won't be made until after
Guzman pitches Saturday's exhibition finale against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just have to adjust,'' Rothschild said. ''We just have to
get by the injuries right now and the first week of the season is
the time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays lost to the Tigers 5-2 Friday. Brian Moehler, who
will start the first-ever game at Detroit's Comerica Park on April
11, allowed two runs and four hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez returned to Detroit's lineup as the designated
hitter after missing Thursday's game with a sore right hamstring
and went 1-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Perry hit his eighth homer of the spring for Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   At Winter Haven Fla., Richie Sexson bruised his right knee in a
collision with the left-field wall and Minnesota banged around
starter Charles Nagy before Cleveland rallied to win 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Walker homered leading off the game and Butch Huskey, who
had five RBIs, had a two-run double in the first on the shot that
sent Sexson into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8 Sexson, primarily a first baseman and DH during his
career, laid motionless for a few moments on the warning track
before walking off the field on his own. X-rays were negative.
</P>
<P>
   ''That kind of popped a little scare into us,'' Indians manager
Charlie Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson was scared, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fine. My kneecap just kind of slid out a little bit,''
Sexson said. ''It was painful, like running into concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the Giants opened their new ballpark and
Willie Mays was all over Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   The address of the San Francisco Giants' new ballpark is named
after its greatest player: 24 Willie Mays Plaza. The signature
entrance is known as Willie Mays Gate. And on a palm tree-lined
concourse just outside the main entrance is the centerpiece, a
9-foot tall statue of Mays unveiled Friday in a public tribute to
the Hall of Famer that drew 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to say I feel like the luckiest man in the world for
having so many friends,'' said Mays, who later Friday threw out the
first pitch at the inaugural game at Pacific Bell Park, an
exhibition between the Giants and Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Marlins 7, Royals 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Melbourne, Fla., Brant Brown, battling Mark Kotsay for
Florida's starting right field job, went 3-for-4 with two RBIs.
White Sox 11, Mariners 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Las Vegas, Paul Konerko homered twice and drove in four runs,
and Frank Thomas also had four RBIs for Chicago.
Braves 5, Orioles 0:
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta, Andruw Jones hit his team-leading seventh home run
of the spring and Terry Mulholland and five relievers combined on a
five-hitter.
Expos 8, Pirates 0:
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Peter Bergeron hit a two-run double and Chris
Widger had a pair of run-scoring singles. Winner Javier Vazquez
allowed three hits in five innings, and struck out four.
Rangers 7, Cardinals 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Arlington, Texas, Ivan Rodriguez said his bruised right elbow
was fine, then proved it by going 3-for-3 with a home run. The
reigning AL MVP was drilled by a pitch Thursday night in a game
against Double-A Tulsa. Once learning X-rays were negative,
Rodriguez wasted no time getting back behind the plate.
Astros 6, Yankees 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Houston, New York's Ricky Ledee homered for the second
straight day at Enron Field, but Lance Berkman gave Houston its
second straight win in its new stadium with a ninth-inning homer.
Blue Jays 10, Dodgers 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Toronto, Raul Mondesi, who asked out of Los Angeles, was
plunked twice and had to go to the hospital as Toronto won in
Mondesi's first game against the Dodgers.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Home court was not a factor the first two
times Connecticut and Tennessee met this season, so playing on a
neutral court should make no difference as the teams battle for the
national championship on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is seeking its seventh title and fourth in six years.
Top-ranked Connecticut won its only championship in 1995, defeating
the Lady Vols to cap an undefeated season.
</P>
<P>
   A missed layup at the buzzer against Tennessee cost Connecticut
a shot at another undefeated season as the Huskies fell to the Lady
Vols 72-71 at home on Feb. 2. Connecticut beat Tennessee 74-67 at
Knoxville on Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ''Knowing their personnel is important,'' Tennessee's Kristen
Clement said. ''We've played them twice and we know them pretty
well. It comes down to how well we execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee advanced to the title game with a 64-54 victory over
Rutgers on Friday. Connecticut beat Penn State 89-67 in the
nightcap.

   REVAMPED REGIONAL: Those long days of regional competition in
the women's tournament -- and midnight starting times -- might be
ending soon.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA and ESPN, which has the television rights to the
tournament, are looking at playing the regionals over four days
instead of two.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the eight regional semifinals are played on one day.
The first game starts late in the morning and the last one tips off
at midnight EST. The four regional championship games are played on
Monday, starting in the early evening and finishing with another
midnight game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to look at that very carefully because neither you
nor we are satisfied that midnight starts are the best things for
us or the best things for the viewers,'' Len DeLuca, ESPN's senior
vice president for programming, said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   HOME SWEET HOMECOMING: Kristen Clement, a native of nearby
Broomall, hit her first three shots and scored eight of Tennessee's
first 10 points as the Lady Vols advanced to the national
championship with a 64-54 victory over Rutgers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clement made a 3-pointer from the top of the arc and a
long-range jumper and a 3-pointer from the wing as the Lady Vols
took a 10-5 lead 5:59 into the game.
</P>

fans, cheering every basket by the Lady Lions and cringing each

   NOTES: Tennessee's Michelle Snow broke a Final Four record
with seven blocked shots. Connecticut's Kara Wolters blocked six
against Tennessee in 1996. ... Shawnetta Stewart, a Philadelphia
native, led Rutgers with 11 points and eight rebounds. She fouled
out with 1:01 left in the game. ... Hillary Howard played in the
national championship game last season as the point guard for Duke,
which lost to Purdue. Howard was back in the Final Four this year,
covering the games as a reporter for an Internet site. ... The
crowd of 20,060 was the largest to attend a college basketball game
in Pennsylvania. The previous high was 19,372 for a Villanova-Notre
Dame men's game in February 1997. . . The NCAA issued 669
credentials for the women's Final Four, most ever in the history of
the tournament, officials said. The number exceeds the amount
issued for the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals and the 1998 U.S. Figure
Skating Championships at the First Union Center.
