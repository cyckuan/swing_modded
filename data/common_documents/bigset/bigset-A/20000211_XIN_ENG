<HEADLINE> Russia Reports Progress in Assault on Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces
continued their assaults on Chechen rebels Friday with senior
military officials predicting faster progress ahead in the
breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
After the seizure of the strategically important populated area
Itum-Kale in southern Chechnya, it is only the administrative
center Shatoi and four populated areas in the flat part of the
republic that are yet to be taken, Chief of Russian General Staff
Anatoly Kvashnin told the press Friday.
</P>
<P>
"And that is all. The remaining task is for special teams that
will comb the mountains, gorges, and caves to eliminate the last
shelters of the fighters," Kvashnin said in an interview with the
NTV television station.
</P>
<P>
"This task is difficult and long-winded, but necessary," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev predicted
that the operation to eliminate bandit formations in mountainous
areas of Chechnya "will be completed quicker than in Grozny," the
regional capital.
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 to 8,000 rebels are resisting Russian federal
forces in the mountainous areas and some 300 fighters remain in
Grozny, the Interfax news agency quoted Sergeyev as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he told a closed hearing of the State Duma lower house
of parliament that it is too early to talk about the conclusion of
the military phase of the operation, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Bislan Gantamirov, the commander of the
pro-Moscow Chechen militia and first deputy Russian envoy in
Chechnya, has been taken to a military hospital, Interfax reported
Friday, quoting Gantamirov's press service.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear why Gantamirov was hospitalized, but Russian
television reported that the former mayor of Grozny might have
been severely wounded.
</P>
<P>
Gantamirov is likely to be transported to Moscow in the near
future, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the military campaign last September following
two waves of armed incursions by Chechen rebels into neighboring
Daghestan and a spate of terrorist bombings, also blamed on
Chechen militants, that killed over 300 people in Moscow and two
other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
With most of the rebels driven into the southern mountainous
regions, the Russian federal forces are regrouping in the next
phase of their anti-terrorist operation, a senior military
official said.
</P>
<P>
Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the Russian Armed Forces
Headquarters, told reporters Friday that "our units are completing
their rest and recuperation after fulfilling the difficult tasks
of the liberation of Grozny."
</P>
<P>
"Even in this period of relative calm, bands are running heavy
losses with all their maneuvers being watched and curbed," the
general said.
</P>
<P>
He described as "a bluff" the rebels' threat to launch "a large-
scale guerrilla war."
</P>
<P>
"There are no objective grounds for it whatsoever," Manilov
said, noting that Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov's statement to
that effect "is nothing but a propaganda exercise."

<HEADLINE> German Foreign Minister Talks With Denktash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer had talks Friday in Hamburg with the leader of
Turkish northern Cyprus, Rauf Denktash, said the German Foreign
Ministry in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The main theme of the talks is new moves to resolve the status
of the island which has been divided between Greek and Turkish
Cypriots since 1974, said the statement of the German Foreign
Ministry. In July 1974 there was a revolt on the Cypriot island
and the Turkish Army invaded into Cyprus. From then on, Cyprus has
been divided into two parts, the Greeks and the Turkish.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Fischer and Denktash agreed that the
European Union's decision in December 1999 was a new dynamic. On
the basis of the decision every side will not insist on a full
Cyprus settlement as a criterion for membership in the EU.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Fischer and Denktash also involved improving
Turkish-Greek relations and the resumption of the United Nations-
sponsored Cyprus negotiations in Geneva, which just completed a
second round.
</P>
<P>
Rauf Denktash is the leader of the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus which declared its independence on November 15,
1983. Besides Turkey, the state is not internationally recognized.
Therefore, Denktash was referred only as "the leader of the
Turkish Cypriot community" in the statement of the German Foreign
Ministry. And Denktash will not come to Berlin. It is also
Denktash's first visit to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Germany has big interests in affairs of the Mediterranean and
the Middle East. It has also a good bilateral relationship with
Turkey. A series of diplomatic actions will take place. Turkish
Foreign Minister Cem will visit Germany to talk with his German
counterpart Fischer. German President Johannes Rau will visit
Turkey in April and will make an official visit to Israel and the
Palestinian Autonomous Region from February 19 on.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Germany sold tanks to Turkey and it touched off
controversies among the coalition of the Red-Green. Therefore,
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had no choice but to cancel his
predetermined visit to Turkey on March 6 to 7 and let President
Rau to go forwards.

<HEADLINE> Endeavor Launched on Earth-Mapping Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Space shuttle Endeavor
roared into the sky Friday to start its 11-day earth-mapping
mission.
</P>
<P>
It blasted off at 12:43 p.m. EDT (1743 GMT) from the space
center at Cape Canaveral, Florida, with a 197-foot (60-meter)
radar antenna on board it.
</P>
<P>
The radar antenna, the longest rigid structure ever deployed
in space, will help scientists to measure the shape and height of
the earth's terrain with high resolution for military and
environmental purposes.
</P>
<P>
Six astronauts are on board the space shuttle, and the crew
will use specialized radar equipment and other electronics to map
70 to 80 percent of the earth's land mass during the mission,
extending from the southern tip of Greenland to the northern edge
of the Antarctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
The flight, scheduled for September and delayed for several
reasons, was NASA's first mission in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Endeavor is set to return to the earth on February 22.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Team Boycott Monitors' Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli representatives withdrew
from an emergency meeting of the five-nation committee monitoring
conflicts in southern Lebanon, the Lebanese representatives said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, scheduled to be held in Nikura, headquarters of the
United Nations peace keeping force in southern Lebanon, was called
off as Israeli team withdrew after receiving words of the killing
of an Israeli soldier in guerrilla attacks hours before.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources said Hezbollah attacked the Israeli
military base at Shakif Castle inside the Israeli-occupied zone,
killing an Israeli soldier.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon Radio quoted Lebanese negotiators as saying the Israeli
side did not get into the negotiating room but withdrew completely
from Nikura.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese sources accused Israel of seeking to escalate the
tension in south Lebanon rather than settling it peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The emergency meeting was scheduled to discuss the latest flare-
ups in southern Lebanon following a series of revenge attacks
between Israeli troops and Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God, guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed by guerrillas since the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes' pounding of Lebanese civilian and guerrilla
targets was well into its second week, destroying three power
stations and injuring dozens of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising representatives from the United
States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, was formed in April,
1996 under the truce understandings reached between Israel and
Hezbollah after a 17-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon, which killed 200
Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
The understandings prohibit attacks on or from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in southern Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim to protect its northern territories from
cross-border attacks. Lebanese guerrillas, spearheaded by
Hezbollah, have been fighting to oust Israeli occupation troops
from Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Team Boycott Monitoring Group Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli team Friday
withdrew from a session of a five-nation committee monitoring
conflicts in southern Lebanon after receiving reports that another
Israeli soldiers was killed by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
No date was set for the resumption of the meeting, which was
scheduled to be held in Nikura, headquarters of the United Nations
peace keeping force in southern Lebanon, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for the
deadly attacks Friday on Beaufot Castle outpost in the Israeli-
occupied southern Lebanon, which left one Israeli soldier dead and
two others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The casualties have yet to be confirmed by the Israel Defense
Force (IDF) spokesman's office, which usually informs the family
members of the soldier's death before disclosing the fatality to
the media and the public.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have warned of harsh response to any new
Hezbollah attacks that kill Israeli soldiers, indicating it is
possible to bomb Lebanese civilian infrastructure again.
</P>
<P>
Israel Air Force (IAF) reportedly made reprisal attacks against
Hezbollah targets immediately after Friday's guerrilla attack.
There are also reports about heavy fighting in the security zone
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The emergency meeting of the monitoring committee was scheduled
to discuss the latest flare-ups in southern Lebanon following a
series of revenge attacks between Israeli troops and Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed by guerrillas since the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes' pounding of Lebanese civilian and guerrilla
targets was well into its second week, destroying three power

States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, was formed in April,
1996 under the truce understandings reached between Israel and
Hezbollah after a 17-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon, which killed 200
Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
The understandings prohibit attacks on or from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria accused Israel of violating the agreements by
intentionally bombing Lebanese power stations on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Israel insists that it was Hezbollah that first violated the
understandings by opening fire from villages.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. voiced hope that the monitoring committee meeting could
prevent the situation in South Lebanon from further jeopardizing
the peace process between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which resumed last December
after a 45-month deadlock, hit a snag again only after two rounds
of talks due to differences over Israel's withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, which it occupied from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in southern Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim to protect its northern territories from
cross-border attacks. Lebanese guerrillas, spearheaded by
Hezbollah, have been fighting to oust Israeli occupation troops
from Lebanon.

British Columbia has become North America's third largest film

<P>
Out of the 198 productions made last year in the province, 116
were Canadian, up 14 percent from the year before, the association
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Smaller centers of film industry also grew last year in the
provinces of Manitoba and Nova Scotia, becoming serious
competitors to Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Canadian film and video productions made inroads
into foreign markets, selling more than 100 million Canadian
dollars (about 69 million U.S. dollars) in exports.
</P>
<P>
The country's film industry and market, however, are still
dominated by foreign productions, which accounted for 98 percent
of distributors' revenue.
</P>
<P>
In British Columbia, the ratio between foreign productions and
domestic ones improved to about three to two last year from the
previous four to one, the association said.

<HEADLINE> INTERFET: Security in Oecussi Enclave to Be High Priority for U.N. Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Ensuring the security
in the Oecussi enclave would be a high priority for the incoming
United Nations force in East Timor, a latest report by the
International Force in East Timor (INTERFET) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The INTERFET is now handing over its responsibilities to U.N.
peacekeepers, which will be completed by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
In its report to the United Nations Security Council covering
roughly a two-month period through the end of January 2000, the
INTERFET described the situation in East Timor as generally "
benign" and "under control," with the exception of the Oecussi
enclave.
</P>
<P>
The report said that militia groups operating from West Timor
continued to "pose an unacceptable threat to peace and security "
in some parts of the enclave's border regions.
</P>
<P>
That threat, the report said, reinforced the appropriateness
of a mandate under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which provides
for the use of force, for both the INTERFET and the U.N.
Transitional Administration in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The cross-border nature of the militia actions underscores the
need for this matter to be resolved primarily by the government of
Indonesia, the INTERFET said.
</P>
<P>
The report also expressed concern over the living conditions
and the increasing number of deaths in the refugee camps.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Expresses Concern Over Situation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma Friday
expressed concern over the continuing violations of a U.N.
Security Council resolution on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a statement passed Friday, the lower house of parliament
said Albanian separatism is gaining momentum in the Yugoslav
province, and violence persists against Serbs and other non-
Albanians, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement said conditions are being created for the
alienation of Kosovo from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The failure to observe U.N. Security Council resolution 1244
casts doubt on the assertions about the aspirations for a
political settlement in Kosovo based on decisions adopted by the U.
N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The violations "are setting another dangerous precedent for
violating the norms of international law with impunity and are
leading to further destruction of the contemporary system of
international relations based on the U.N.'s authority," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian lawmakers voiced solidarity with the Yugoslavian
leadership in its efforts to protect Belgrade's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, the document said.

<P>
PARIS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- France will continue joining the
normal functioning of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) despite Austria's present one-year
rotating presidency in the organization.
</P>
<P>
"France will continue to participate normally the functioning
of OSCE. That should not be put into question," said French
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret Friday.
</P>
<P>
French and Belgian representatives boycotted Thursday a speech
by Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner at the
permanent council of the OSCE in Vienna to protest against the
entry into the Austrian government by the extreme-right Freedom
Party of Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
"Our representative could not listen impassively the speech of
an Austrian minister before the permanent council," said Gazeau-
Secret.
</P>
<P>
She refused to specify whether France recognizes that Ferrero-
Waldner could represent the OSCE or whether France would support
Austria's leadership in future OSCE missions abroad.
</P>
<P>
The predecessor of Ferrero Waldner, Norwegian Foreign Minister
Knut Vollebaek, led several missions to the northern Caucasus in
the name of the OSCE last year.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Employment and Solidarity Martine Aubry and
her Belgian counterpart also walked out when their Austrian
counterpart, Elisabeth Sickl, made a speech at an informal meeting
of the European Union (EU) in Lisbon Friday.
</P>
<P>
France has expressed its intention to isolate Austria within
the European circle as an extra measure to boycott the new
government in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The EU has adopted three measures against Austria including the
suspension of bilateral cooperation, reduction of reception of
Austrian ambassadors to technical level, and refusal to support
Austrian candidates for posts in international organizations.

<HEADLINE> Studies Say Italian Crime Rate Near Bottom in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Europe's crime rate is rising but
Italy is still almost at the bottom of the pile for crimes
reported between 1987 and 1998, an Italian social thinktank
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian social investment studies center (Censis) said that
Italy had shown a 29.9 percent increase in reported crimes over
the decade, second only to Germany which had a massive 45.3
percent leap.
</P>
<P>
But Italy was still near the bottom of the European rankings
with 421.2 crimes for every 10,000 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Censis said the increase in reported crimes showed greater
civic response by citizens and better action by police.
</P>
<P>
The rankings were surprising and hinted that real crime rates
were very different from those based on complaints or reports.
</P>
<P>
Sweden headed the list with 1,345.5 crimes for every 10,000
citizens, followed by Denmark with 941.6, Britain with 834.4,
Holland with 778.1 and France with 605.9.
</P>
<P>
Only Spain, where reporting also appears to be unreliable, had
a lower rate than Italy with just 223.
</P>
<P>
The highest murder rate was in Belgium, Sweden and Portugal
with 2.1 for every 100,000 inhabitants, while Italy was about
midway with 1.5.
</P>
<P>
About a quarter of Italian murders are committed by organized
crime, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Armed robberies were most frequent in Spain (171.1 per 1,000,
000), France (143.2) and Britain (126.2). In Italy the rate was
just 65.6.

LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- NatWest Bank plc conceded
defeat in its battle for independence Friday, recommending
shareholders accept a 22 billion pound off from the Royal Bank of
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The move signals the end of NatWest's attempts to remain
independent after a five-month struggle to reject rival bids from
the Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
NatWest's capitulation was expected after Bank of Scotland
chief executive Peter Burt informed his staff Thursday in an
internal memo that it had lost its bid.
</P>
<P>
NatWest, the UK's third largest bank, said it will work with
the Royal Bank of Scotland to ensure success of the new group and
protect shareholder interest.
</P>
<P>
Royal Bank &AMP; NatWest will be Europe's seventh-largest bank by
market capitalization and Britain's third-largest overall, behind
the HSBC Holdings Plc and the Lloyds TSB Group Plc.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Scotland launched the battle for NatWest when it
launched a hostile bid on Sept. 24 last year. Royal Bank entered
the race on 24 November.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientist Says Ancient Romans Sailed to America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ancient Romans managed to
sail across the Atlantic more than a thousand years before
Columbus, U.S. anthropologist Roman Hristov argues in the current
edition of New Scientist.
</P>
<P>
Hristov bases his amazing claim on a small black terra-cotta
statuette of a bearded man found in the Toluca Valley 60km west of
Mexico City in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The freelance anthropologist points out that it bears an
uncanny resemblance to Roman art and no likeness at all to pre-
Columbian statuettes.
</P>
<P>
According to a sophisticated dating performed at the Max Planck
Institute in Germany, the little head dates to about 200 AD.
</P>
<P>
The tomb in which it was found dates to before 1510, at least
10 years before the Conquistadors arrived.
</P>
<P>
But the magazine also carried the opinion of Betty Meggers of
the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, who said
that contacts between the two worlds before 1492 were "possible"
but warned that the statuette had "features similar to Ecuadorian
and Japanese pottery."
</P>
<P>
David Grove of the University of Illinois told New Scientist
that the Toluca Valley head is undoubtedly Roman but that does not
mean that Roman sailors landed on the coast of Mexico 1,800 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Columbus's claim to discovering America has been challenged
before, most notably by supporters of the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
But no one has ever suggested a first contact so far back in
time.

<HEADLINE> Belarus, Russia Vow to Expand High-Tech Arms Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Belarus and Russia Friday vowed
to expand their cooperation in the manufacture of high-tech
weapons and regain their position in the world arms markets.
</P>
<P>
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko told visiting
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov in Minsk that a
financial group for a Belarus-Russian defense system will make it
possible to surge ahead in the production of and trade in high-
tech hardware.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said the two countries' potential will make it
possible to regain lost positions on the world arms markets, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Belarussian leader described the proposed group as "yet
another transmission belt that will bound Belarus and Russia in a
single state."
</P>
<P>
Klebanov, for his part, said the Russian government's chief
concern is "to integrate the military industrial complexes of the
two countries as deeply as possible."
</P>
<P>
The Russian-Belarussian group "will jointly design, manufacture,
and sell anti-aircraft defense hardware as the commodity that is
most in demand on the world arms market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov said that Russia will increase the state defense
contract 1.5 times in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We wish it could be more sensible to integrate the Belarussian
defense industry into it (the contract), even though today it does
quite a lot for Russia too," he said.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov also said that Russia has itself the task to boost
arms export to 4.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We should do this together, substituting each other and acting
side by side wherever necessary," he added.

<HEADLINE> Britain Suspends N.Ireland Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain announced Friday the
suspension of Northern Ireland's two-month-old power-sharing
coalition government of pro-British Protestants and pro-Irish
Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to suspend the executive and institutions,"
said Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson after a day of
tension about the fate of the home-rule due to a row over refusal
of Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas to disarm.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson's announcement came just minutes after Gerry Adams ,
head of the IRA's Sinn Fein political wing, had said a "major
breakthrough" on the disarmament issue had been achieved.
</P>
<P>
But despite Adams' upbeat comments, Mandelson made it clear
that there was still deadlock on the vexed issue of IRA
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"We have got to clear up this issue of decommissioning (
disarmament) once and for all," Mandelson said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's decision to freeze the home-rule government came on
the eve of a convention of the powerful Ulster Unionist Party at
which UUP leader David Trimble has said he would announce his
resignation as first minister of the province in protest at the
IRA refusal to hand in arms.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said Friday there
had been progress on the issue of Irish republican guerrilla
disarmament, but not enough to stop the suspension of Northern
Ireland home rule.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly there has been progress in the discussions that have
been taking place, but the clarity that was called for was not
there when (Northern Ireland Secretary) Peter Mandelson made his
decision," said a spokesman for Blair.
</P>
<P>
Blair's reaction came minutes after Mandelson announced that
Britain was resuming direct rule in Northern Ireland after failing
to get a breakthrough from the IRA on disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Mozambicans Fully Mobilized to Flood Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- All the Mozambican government's
 attentions are currently directed to the rampant flood in the
south and centre of the country, Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi
said at a briefing on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"All our work is dedicated to intensifying the operations to
save lives and property, and provide humanitarian assistance to
the victims," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi expressed great appreciation for the various forms of
national and international solidarity with the flood-stricken
areas, praising the individual initiatives taken by citizens to
help those less fortunate than themselves.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the most serious situation in the south
remains in the Incomati valley. "Our main concern right now is to
rescue people who are completely surrounded by water in Ilha
Josina Machel, in Manhica district," he said.
</P>
<P>
The flood on the Incomati has cut the main road from Maputo
northwards, which means that Gaza and Inhambane provinces can no
longer receive consumer goods from the capital.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said the government is seeking alternatives, possibly
by moving supplies in the opposite direction - southward from
Beira towards Inhambane and Gaza, now that the break in the main
road in Chibabava district, Sofala province, has been repaired.
</P>
<P>
As for the Sabie river, the main tributary of the Incomati,
Mocumbi said the waters have now receded sufficiently to allow
helicopters to land in Sabie town.
</P>
<P>
According to the prime minister, continuing rescue efforts are
needed in the Sofala district of Buzi, where the Buzi river has
inundated the district capital and cut the road to Beira.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has sent Environment Minister John
Kachamila and Labour Minister Mario Sevene to Buzi "to help
identify the areas where people are isolated and need urgent
assistance."
</P>
<P>
According to Mocumbi, the worst of the flooding has yet to hit
the most heavily populated parts of Gaza.
</P>
<P>
A flood wave is travelling down the Limpopo river and will hit
the town of Chokwe, at the heart of Limpopo Valley irrigated
agriculture, later on Friday. Over the weekend, this flood wave
should reach the provincial capital, Xai-Xai, which is still
reeling from the effects of the torrential rains of February 4-7.
</P>
<P>
"Gaza is on a state of maximum alert,", he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime Minister believed that the prices in Maputo and
Matola could be stabilized now that the new Maputo-South Africa
motorway, though unfinished, has been opened to traffic as an
emergency measure.
</P>
<P>
Prices had risen sharply in the city markets earlier this week.
With the roads to the normal suppliers in South Africa and
Swaziland cut, there had been a sudden rush of consumers to the
markets to stock up.
</P>
<P>
As for cooperation with neighboring countries, Mocumbi said the
 Mozambican authorities had received "regular and trustworthy"
information from South Africa, about the level of the rivers, and
discharges from dams.
</P>
<P>
This had allowed warnings to be issued in good time to people
living in the river valleys, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Small Enterprises Calls for Policy Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 11 (Xinhua) (C The growth of small-medium
scale enterprises (SMEs) in Zimbabwe is being hindered by lack of
a policy framework and strategies to guide the development of the
sector, a senior government official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Commerce deputy secretary for enterprise
development Sarah Nago told a workshop on SMEs that there was need
for guidelines and clear practical measures to help grassroots
firms.
</P>
<P>
She said although efforts had been made to support the
development of SMEs by various institutions in the country, the
lack of a policy framework was a serious drawback to the sector
which has the potential to turn around the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
"SMEs are considered to be critical in an economy. In a
developing country like ours, they assume a new dimension of
reducing unemployment and poverty," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It is our belief that SMEs in Zimbabwe can be the engine for
growth hence the need to assist them in every possible way," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She said the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, together with
other stakeholders, has come up with a draft document which would
help identify the possible areas of intervention and carry out
the implementation plans.
</P>
<P>
She said after the road-shows which were expected to be
completed by April, the draft would then be submitted to the
National Economic Consultative Forum for adoption before being
sent for cabinet approval.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 11 (Xinhua) (C South African President Thabo
Mbeki has arrived in Harare on Friday for crucial investment and
trade talks with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The talks are a follow up to a similar summit held in Pretoria
late last year when a number of joint projects in energy,
transport, tourism and trade were mooted.
</P>
<P>
However, Zimbabwe's Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan
Shamuyarira said Friday's meeting will focus on the South African
government's endeavors to assist its northern neighbor and largest
African trading partner solve its critical fuel and energy
shortages.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is currently reeling under a crippling fuel shortage
that is threatening to ground its economic activities and
negotiations are in progress for South African companies to help
source cheap fuel for this country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe also imports electricity from South Africa's Eskom.
Eskom recently threatened to cut off power supplies to Zimbabwe
over the debt, but sources at the meeting said Zimbabwe paid
something in January, earning a short reprieve from imminent
power cuts that could have worsened the country's problems which
are already compounded by foreign currency shortages.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki is accompanied by Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana
Zuma, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and other officials.

LUANDA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Angola will get humanitarian
goods worth some 13.5 million ecus (about 13 million U.S. dollars)

</P>
<P>
So far the Angolan government has spent more than 11 million

</P>
<P>
As a result of both the military actions launched by Jonas
Savimbis movements and the return of various people from the areas
newly re-captured by the national army, the number of displaced
Angolans reached 3.7 million late January.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Resume Cooperation with Int'l Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Vice President Poul
Kagame said on Thursday that his country will fully resume
cooperation with the International Crime Tribunal for Rwanda
(ICTR) after three months of suspension because the tribunal
decided to release Bosco Barayagwiza.
</P>
<P>
Kagame, who is also Defense Minister, said "there has been
cooperation and it is important that this cooperation continues to
exist for the work of ICTR and even the Government of Rwanda to
run smoothly and see trials continuing and even reach a wider
scope."
</P>
<P>
According to Rwadan News Agency report on Friday, Carla Del
Ponte, the ICTR Chief Prosecutor, has arrived in Rwanda to seek
cooperations with the Rwandan government.
</P>
<P>
 Relations between Rwanda and the ICTR were halted in November
1999 when the UN Tribunal's appeals chamber ordered the release of
Barayagwiza who is regarded as one of the top planners of 1994
genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR Chief Prosecutor said she fully understood the
reaction of Rwanda, " Barayagwiza's case is to be re-heard later
this month I will personally be in the Hague to represent the
prosecution, we have high hopes that the decision of the Appeals'
Court will be reversed ", del Ponte told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR Chief Prosecutor said even though trials of genocide
suspects at ICTR seem to take long, ICTR is this time determined
to ensure that more suspects are arrested and tried.
</P>
<P>
So far, a number of key suspects have been arrested this year
in different countries and they include, Pastor Elizaphan
Ntakirutimana, who was arrested in Texas, Colonel Muvunyi arrested
in London, major Ndindiliyimana arrested in Beligium and Jean de
Dieu Kamuhanda in France.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The infant mortality rate in
Rwanda is as high as 10.5 percent and 17 percent of the children
do not reach their fifth birthday.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan News Agency on Friday quoted a report from Rwadan
Ministry of Health as saying that Malaria remains highest cause of
death for children, although HIV/AIDS poses an increasing threat.
</P>
<P>
It said that in urban areas about 25-30% of pregnant women are
HIV positive with the subsequent risk of transmitting the virus to
their children.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, more than 70 percent of pregnant women
have their first prenatal visit after the sixth month and most of
them deliver at home, causing infant and maternal deaths.
</P>
<P>
It is observed that while 80 percent of the population have
access to health services, health services and medical personnel
remain in urban centres.
</P>
<P>
This, along with the cost of treatment and drugs leads to a low
 utilization of available health facilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The total number of displaced
people in Angola reached 3.7 millions at the end of January or one
third of the total population, the Inter-ministerial Commission
for Humanitarian Aid said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that the number has increased 15.6 percent
as compared with last September after the government launched an
all-out offensive against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The number of the people in need has increased following the
government's recapture of some areas from the control of the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), it
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official source, the southern African country
witnessed a sharp rise of displaced people late January, with
40,000 of them registered during the last ten days of that month.
</P>
<P>
This increment is followed by the intensified military actions
around the country, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
Angola has spent some 11.4 million U.S. dollars to buy 18,400
tons of medical and food assistance since last November.
</P>
<P>
The Angolans obtained donations worth 2.5 million dollars from
the international community and the United Nations agencies in
late January alone.

<HEADLINE> Turkey at Odds With World Bank on Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Minister of Agriculture
and Rural Affairs Husnu Yusuf Gokalp has indicated Turkey is still
far from seeing eye to eye with the World Bank (WB) over the
country's proposed agricultural reforms.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish government recognizes the need to reform the
agricultural sector and is determined to carry it out," "but
Turkish authorities and bank experts continue to have differences
on a number of issues," Gokalp said.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the assessment in an interview with the
English-language Turkish Daily News published on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A critical difference between the government and the WB prevails
on the method of subsidization.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot make an immediate nationwide start to direct income
support," he said, adding direct income support cannot be the sole
means to subsidize the sector.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry is pushing for compensatory payments, input and
insurance subsidies, market support -- which means the state will
be able to intervene in the market to keep prices above a certain
level --, export and storage incentives besides direct income
support," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gokalp said the government refuses to privatize the Turkish
Grain Board (TMO), which he views as a strategic institution for
the country.
</P>
<P>
"Its management must be rehabilitated, but it cannot be
privatized as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
The WB has suggested privatizing the grain office within three
years as well as other institutions responsible for supporting
purchase of sugar, beet, tobacco, tea and the like, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister added the two sides cannot agree on the time to
complete the establishment of a data base, specifically a farmer
registration system.
</P>
<P>
"The existing statistical data is not reliable. We have to
complete the registration of farmers before introducing the
proposed direct income support," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Gokalp, the data base will not be ready until 2001,
later than the WB's deadline of year-end 2000.
</P>
<P>
The WB has pledged financial assistance to Turkey's projected
agro-reforms as part of a 3-billion-U.S. dollar loan package. Talks
between the two sides are reportedly progressing at a technical
level.

<HEADLINE> EU Launches Campaign Against Work-related Muscle Disorders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
making efforts to cut the number of work-related musculoskeletal
disorders, one of the most common work-related ailments affecting
millions of European workers in all sectors, the European
Commission said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A campaign is being launched to provide timely information
about the work-related back injuries and other musculoskeletal
disorders, which are costing billions of euros in lost
productivity and increased health and social costs in Europe every
year, said the commission, the executive body of the EU.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will be conducted by the European Agency for
Safety and Health at Work, which is an EU institution for helping
meet the information needs in the field of occupational safety and
health.
</P>
<P>
The disorders cover a wide range of health problems and there
is strong evidence that the number of people affected is on the
increase.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent European survey, 30 percent of workers
complain of back pain, 17 percent complain of muscular pain in
arms and legs, while 45 percent reported working in painful or
tiring positions.
</P>
<P>
However, much of the pain and suffering could be prevented or
significantly reduced by simply following existing health and
safety regulations and guidance on good practice.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for employment and social affairs, Anna
Diamantopoulou, said the aches, pains and injuries caused by poor
workplace practices are a heavy burden borne by far too many
European workers, with women being most at risk.

announced the failure of the meeting and accused Aidid and his
followers for undermining their peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
He accused Aidid and his supporters for been engrossed into
armed confrontations in Lower Shabelleh region between the Islamic
courts and the Rahanwein Resistance Army and in Bur Hakaba of Bay
region between opposing Rahanwein people.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Bod also accused non-specified foreign governments for
supporting the anti-peace campaign by Aidid's faction in Lower
Shabelleh and Bay regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hussein Hajji Bod, Ali Mahdi's former deputy
chairman, also accused Aidid and Afrah for opposing to Djibouti
President Ismail Omar Gelleh's peace plan which had been supported
by the faction leaders in the early days of their meeting in late
December last year.
</P>
<P>
The details of the Djibouti peace plan for Somalia were aired
by the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) Somali Service on
Thursday and has been warmly welcomed by the majority of the
Somalis.
</P>
<P>
However, Afrah, a close ally of Aidid, denied the proposal
outright, describing it as a plan for segregating the southern
politicians from those of northwest and northeastern regions of
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti President proposed to hold a reconciliation conference
in Djibouti between April 20 and May 5 this year and be attended
by what is called the clean Somalis whose personal interests are
less important than the common good.
</P>
<P>
In the conference, politicians, clan elders and civil society
members would endorse a president, a prime minister and a
parliament spokesman.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, the president, the prime minister
and the parliament spokesman will reside in Mogadishu in June, and
the prime minister will start selecting his cabinet of ministers
for the completion of the Somali government.
</P>
<P>
However, some well-armed factions including Aidid's are not
convinced about the plan.
</P>
<P>
According to independent politicians, unless an international
force or a regional one comes for its implementation, the
Djibouti's peace plan will end up in a failure, similar to those
proposed in Cairo, Addis Ababa, Nairobi and Djibouti itself during
the past nine years war.

<HEADLINE> France Rejects U.S. Media Accusation Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- France on Friday rejected the
accusation by U.S. newspapers that French troops in Kosovo refused
to help UN police during the clashes between ethnic Serbs and
Albanians in Kosovska Mitrovica last week.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
that the relevant report by The Washington Post and relayed by The
International Herald Tribune was totally groundless.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post on Thursday quoted unidentified UN police
personnel in Kosovo as saying that French troops in charge of
security in the northern Kosovo city refused to offer help during
the clashes, in which five Albanians were killed and many others
injured.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of attacks, murders, by zones of brigades, the
results are the best in the north than in other zones," said
Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
French troops command the UN-mandated Kosovo Force (KFOR)
brigade in the northern zone of the five zones in Kosovo which are
separately controlled by the United States, Britain, Germany,
Italy and France.
</P>
<P>
The French Defense Ministry also rejected the accusation by U.S.
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
France has been repeatedly criticized by some of its NATO
allies for adopting a pro-Serb stand in Bosnia and Kosovo.

</P>
<P>
The re-exports to the United States, Japan, France, Taiwan,
Germany, the United Kingdom and the Chinese mainland registered
double-digit increases.
</P>
<P>
The value of re-exports in 1999, at 1,178.4 billion HK dollars
(151.1 billion U.S. dollars), was 1.7 percent higher than that in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Increases were also reported in the value of domestic exports
to Singapore, the United States, the Chinese mainland, the United
Kingdom, France, Germany and Canada in December 1999 over the same
period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, decreases were recorded in the value of domestic

<HEADLINE> HK's Tourism Revenue Drops Slightly in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's tourism receipts
in 1999 dropped by 4.1 percent from the previous year to 52.98
billion HK dollars (6.79 billion U.S. dollars), according to the
Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is increasingly recognized as being good value for
money in terms of accommodation and retail prices and for
excellent in-bound air and tour packages," said Amy Chan,
executive director of HKTA. "This is the silver lining to the
recent economic downturn that has helped fuel the recovery in
tourism that brought 10.7 million visitors to Hong Kong in 1999."
</P>
<P>
Asia accounted for the bulk of receipts among the regional
markets. Visitors from the Chinese mainland were the largest
contributor, spending 13.48 billion HK dollars (1.73 billion U.S.
dollars), while Taiwan was second with 10.95 billion HK dollars (1.
4 billion U.S. dollars), followed by North Asia, South and
Southeast Asia, America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Chan said the HKTA's strategy for 2000 is to increase revenue
by 7.9 percent, by targeting high-yield segments and convincing
all visitors to stay longer.

<HEADLINE> Another Israeli Soldier Killed by Hezbollah: Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli soldier was
killed and another wounded in the Israeli-occupied security zone in
South Lebanon on Friday, Israel Wire reported.
</P>
<P>
The attack raised Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) death toll in the
region to seven.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has taken credit for the deadly rocket and mortar
attacks aimed at the Beaufot Castle outpost, claiming that they
killed at least one Israeli soldier.
</P>
<P>
However, the report has not be confirmed by the IDF Spokesman's
Office, who usually adopts a procedure to inform soldiers' families
of the fatality before announcing the news to the media and the
public.
</P>
<P>
Friday's renewed tensions in the region came as monitors from
the United States, France, Lebanon, Israel and Syria were meeting
in Nikura, Lebanon to try to contain this week's flare-up.
</P>
<P>
It is still unknown whether the latest casualties will be the
last straw that escalates tensions to a vicious circle of
retaliation following weeks of heightened fighting in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have warned of harsh response to any new
Hezbollah attacks that kill Israeli soldiers and heavy fighting is
being reported in the security zone on Friday afternoon
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shiite Muslim militant group fighting to
end Israeli occupation, had killed six Israeli soldiers and a
senior commander of Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army in the past
weeks.
</P>
<P>
In revenge, Israeli warplanes bombed Lebanese infrastructure
sites and suspected Hezbollah targets in recent days, which
reportedly had wounded at least 15 Hezbollah guerrillas and two
dozen civilians.

MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that it will undertake the nation's first census in the new
millennium in May 2000.
</P>
<P>
Tomas Africa, administrator of the National Statistics Office(
NSO), said the Census 2000 would provide the nation with the
fundamental database critical to its progress.
</P>
<P>
Africa also asked the Department of Labor and Employment to
once again lend the NO its expertise by helping train census
enumerators.

The teachers will be trained for a week, followed by data
gathering up to the third week of May.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Declines in India: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- India has witnessed a sharp
decline in poverty, with percentage of population living below the
poverty line coming down from 56.44 percent in 1973-74 to 37.24
percent in 1993-94, said the newly-released India Rural
Development Report 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the report by the Ministry of Rural Development noted
that the poverty incidence has increased in the country's central
and eastern regions during the period, mainly due to inefficiency
of agriculture and failure of land reforms there.
</P>
<P>
It cited two states, Bihar and Assam, as examples. Percentage
of population living below the poverty line in these two states
grew respectively to 58.21 and 45.01 percent in 1993-94 from 53.63
and 39.35 percent in 1987-88.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the central and eastern states, the western
states have done a much better job in eliminating poverty, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The report also listed out states with their poor population
proportions exceeding 45 percent, which include Assam, Bihar,
Orissa and Uttar Pradesh.

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan Faces Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan has been facing
acute shortage of food items, especially wheat flour, said a
senior World Food Program (WFP) official here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"At the national level the UN has estimated that in the year to
June 30, 2000, there is a shortfall of 1.1 million tons between
the domestic availability of wheat and the consumption needs of
people," said the official in a press conference at the local UN
Office.
</P>
<P>
He told the press conference that due to the collapse of the
economy and employment opportunities, few people had sufficient
income to buy their essential food needs, together with adequate
clothing, shelter and heating fuel in the frosting winter.
</P>
<P>
Giving details about the key indicators of poverty in Kabul,he
said that poor rains in the 1998-99 winter caused an estimated 16
percent drop in wheat production in 1999. Since October 1999, the
new Pakistan authorities have imposed border restrictions which
constrain the flow of wheat flour and other products into
Afghanistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that mostly dry conditions were experienced in much of
southern and central Afghanistan up to the middle of Jan 2000
which increased the chances of crop failure especially for rain-
fed crops.

<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Interior Secretary
Alfredo Lim vowed Friday to crack down on violent activities of
fraternities which have resulted in several deaths and injuries
among students in the country.
</P>
<P>
This came after a student of the University of the Philippines
(UP)was killed and another was wounded during a fraternity rumble
in the UP campus in Quezon City of Metro Manila Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Recently, another student was also killed during a grenade-
throwing incident at the gate of the Technological Institute of
the Philippines, also in Quezon City. Investigators linked the
incident to a feud between two warring fraternities.
</P>
<P>
Lim said in a statement that he will confer with Philippine
National Police Chief Panfilo Lacson to have a meeting with
university presidents to launch an intensified campaign against
fraternities"where the rule of violence is being practiced."
</P>
<P>
Exhorting school security officials and students to make their
campuses "havens of peace and tranquillity," Lim said weapons
should be banned in campuses and students should be made
answerable by school authorities for any and all acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
He said erring school officials who, in one way or the other,
are contributing to the existence of these violence, should also
be made criminally liable.
</P>
<P>
"It is about time we take action on these officials who are lax
in the enforcement of school regulations," Lim said.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Celebrates 10th Anniversary of Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela Friday opened a museum in his birthplace
of Village Mvezo, Transkei, Eastern Cape Province, marking the
10th anniversary of his release from the apartheid jails.
</P>
<P>
About 500 senior officials and local villagers extended a warm
welcome ceremony to Mandela, who was born in the small village
nearly 82 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Coming here reminds me of my days as a child," the retired
president told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
The remains of the homestead where Mandela was born have been
preserved at Mvezo, which comprise the first portion of the
three-part Nelson Mandela Museum whose another two components are
in Qunu village and Umtata.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is expected to open the other two segments later Friday.
</P>
<P>
The museums will surely attract tourists throughout the world,
creating jobs and pushing forward the economic development of the
Eastern Cape Province, deputy minister of South African Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology Department Brigitte Mabandla said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had been imprisoned for 27 years since 1964 after the
apartheid regime sentenced him "guilty of plotting to overthrow
the government".
</P>
<P>
His release was ordered by the last apartheid president F.W. de
Klerk on February 11, 1990. Mandela was elected South Africa's
first black president in the democratic election in 1994.
</P>
<P>
 Mandela handed over the presidency to his deputy Thabo Mbeki
last year after five years in the office.

WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Republican presidential campaign took another sharply
negative turn Thursday when an angry and emotional John McCain
accused George W. Bush of spreading false information about him to
voters and called on his rival to agree to stop all negative
advertising.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ordered Thursday an
immediate inspection of the entire fleet of single-aisle planes
built by McDonnell Douglas -- 1,100 in the United States -- after
two Alaska Airlines aircraft were found to have damage in the tail
section similar to that found in the wreckage of Alaska Airlines
Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Iraq said Friday that it would not allow United Nations
inspectors back to Baghdad to reinstate a disarmament program
halted on the eve of American and British air strikes in December
1998.
</P>
<P>
-- In what appeared to be a serious new effort to prosecute
Indonesia's former president Soeharto, the Indonesian government
for the first time named him as a suspect Thursday in a widening
corruption investigation and summoned him for questioning on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Internet leaders will meet with the Clinton Administration
next week to plot a response to the spate of attacks on Web sites.
The attacks appeared to have ebbed as Internet firms stepped up
efforts to counter them.
</P>
<P>
-- The current economic expansion, the longest in U.S. history,
can continue "indefinitely," Martin Baily, chairman of the
president's Council of Economic Advisers, said Thursday in
releasing the administration's annual economic report.

<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
recently called on localities along the banks of the Yellow River
to prevent ice-related problems in the 5,400-km river.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters, more than 1,100 kilometers of the river's main
channel froze over this especially cold winter, which has seen the
lowest average temperature in the past 13 years.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters warned that the breakup of the large amount of
ice in the river in the coming spring will do significant damage
to the banks and dams.
</P>
<P>
It asked officials at giant dams such as Liujiaxia, Sanmenxia
and Xiaolangdi to control the river flow in an attempt to keep
disaster at bay.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local sources said that the frozen parts of the
river's middle and lower sections have already started to melt.

<HEADLINE> Iran Slams Israel for Latest Attacks on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami has condemned Israel for its latest air raids on south
Lebanon and lashed out at the West for continuing political support
to it.
</P>
<P>
"As the incumbent president of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, I am sympathizing with the great nation of Lebanon,"
Khatami was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said he has sent letters to heads of the Islamic states "with
regard to the latest Israeli attacks" on Lebanon. He was addressing
Iran-based foreign diplomats on the occasion of the 21st
anniversary of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes struck three power stations in Beirut, Baalbek
and the northern city of Tripoli in Lebanon early Tuesday, injuring
18 civilians and plunging much of the country into darkness.
</P>
<P>
Israel said that its strikes targeted the strongholds of
Lebanese Hezbollah in retaliation for the guerrillas' killing of
five Israeli soldiers in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also slammed the west for its support for Israel. "Why
Israel whose existence is based on usurping the lands of others
should enjoy the backing of the United States and other Western
countries?" he said.
</P>
<P>
He questioned the logic that Iran "which spends the least on
defense compared with its southern neighbors in the region is
accused of militarism and subjected to attacks, while Israel which
is in possession of all means of mass destruction is being
awarded."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran is "inviting all human beings to peace and
that the Western powers could contribute to the cause of peace more
than others."

<HEADLINE> Israel Hints Committed to Monitoring Rules in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel is still interested in
returning to the 1996 Grapes of Wrath understandings to ease
tension in south Lebanon, a top aide of Israeli Prime Minis Ehud
Barak said Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, National Security Adviser Danny Yatom said that
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas should committed to abiding by the
monitoring rules first, according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered understandings agreed in 1996 to end the
Israeli Operation Grapes of Wrath in Lebanon, in which 200 Lebanese
civilians were killed, forbid attacks on civilian targets or
launching attacks from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
Yatom's remarks synchronized the meeting of the five-nation
truce monitoring committee in Nakura, Lebanon on Friday, which will
address complaints raised by Syria, Lebanon and Israel
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The committee had the opportunity to convene only after Israel
gave its go-ahead, another signal showing that Israel will not
abandon the current monitoring rules. The committee comprises of
the U.S., France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Barak's spokesman Gadi Baltiansky said that
there is no point confirming Israel's commitment to the
understandings when Hezbollah continues to "violate them
systematically".
</P>
<P>
It once led some analysts to believe that Barak, who was under
great pressure from some Israeli right-wing politicians, is
reluctant to get back to the understandings.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is a Lebanese Shiite Muslim militant
group fighting to end Israeli occupation since 1985. It stepped up
attacks in the Israeli self-styled security zone in the past weeks
and killed seven Israeli soldiers and a senior commander of
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
In revenge, Israeli warplanes on Monday bombed three power
stations in Lebanon, wounding at least two dozen civilians and
causing a total damage of 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon, called
Israeli air raids a "barbaric aggression against civilian targets"
and violated the 1996 ceasefire understandings.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel insisted that it was Hezbollah that first
violated the understanding by opening fire from villages.

<HEADLINE> People Key to Poverty Reduction in S. Asia: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Full mobilization of natural
and human resources are the key for poverty alleviation in the
South Asian countries, according to experts and scholars who
gathered here to discuss ways for poverty eradication in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar which ended here Friday focused on the
importance of cooperation among the regional countries and better
utilization of human and natural resources on the way to
development.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Dr. Ponna Wignaraja, Chairman of the South Asia
Perspective Network Association (SAPNA), said that in developing
countries, the people, instead of capital and imported technology,
are the greatest asset for the development.
</P>
<P>
"For poverty alleviation, the human factor becomes critical,
while the poor become the subjects of development and not merely
the objects," he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that institutions be built in the South Asian
region in order to fully mobilize people's creativity and
knowledge in the process of poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the seminar, Nepali Foreign Minister Ram Shram
Mahat said as the gap in wealth between the South Asia and the
rest of the world is enlarging, the governments of the region
should make more cooperation and take effective measures for
poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
With a focus on social mobilization, the Nepali government has
set up various institutions, such as micro-credit networks, to
help rural people start income-generating productions and engage
in self-reliance development, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 governmental and non-governmental officials,
experts and scholars from Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and
Sri Lanka participated in the seminar jointly organized by the
National Planning Commission of Nepal, Sri Lanka-based SAPNA and
Support Activities for Poor Producers of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The South Asia remains one of the poorest regions in the world,
with about 40 percent of the people in the region living in
absolute poverty.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Foreign Minister
Knut Vollebaek will visit Sri Lanka next Wednesday in a bid to
broker peace in the war-torn island nation, the state radio said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Minister Vollebaek will hold talks with Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga, his counterpart Lakshman Kadirgamar and
opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as well as other political
figures, the radio said in its night broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek was previously scheduled to visit Sri Lanka on
January 15 to examine prospects for peace, but the trip was
cancelled as Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Kadirgamar was not in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In late January, a Norwegian delegation led by State Secretary
Leiv Lunde arrived in Colombo to prepare the ground for active
revival of the talks between the government and Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) rebels who have been fighting a 17-year-old
war for a separate Tamil state in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
The delegation met top Sri Lankan government officials and
leaders of the main opposition and some smaller Tamil political
parties.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga revealed in an interview after her
reelection as president last December that Norway was trying to
help end the conflict which has plagued Sri Lanka since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Norway began its efforts to revive its role in arranging peace
talks after Kumaratunga said in the interview that she was ready
for Norwegian facilitation.

<HEADLINE> Japan, Russia Reaffirm Year-End Peace Treaty Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov and his Japanese counterpart Yohei Kono
agreed Friday to continue efforts toward concluding a peace treaty
within this year.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers reached the agreement during their
four-hour talks, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese official said Kono and Ivanov reaffirmed a series
of past agreements and declarations, including the 1997 accord, in
an apparent bid to clear the confusion caused by Ivanov's recent
comments in which he cast doubt over the prospects of concluding a
peace treaty within this year.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov told a Japanese news agency Tuesday that it is important
not "to create illusions in respect of the possibilities of
achieving decisions in a certain time frame..."
</P>
<P>
His comments appeared to be a reversal of a 1997 agreement
between the then Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the then
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to strive to resolve a
territorial dispute and conclude a peace treaty by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's resignation on New Year's Eve dimmed the prospects
for progress on the treaty as Tokyo had pinned its hopes on
Yeltsin's personal commitment to rejuvenating the stalled
negotiations through a visit to Japan that had been planned for
this spring.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, who arrived Thursday for a four-day visit, confirmed
Russia's commitment to the peace treaty process during a meeting
Thursday with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Kono, the two ministers agreed on the need to
make possible a visit to Japan by a newly elected Russian
president as early as possible, after the presidential elections
scheduled for March 26.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to boost economic cooperation in a bid to
improve the environment for the peace treaty negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Kono reiterated Japan's commitment to supporting Russia's
reform efforts, providing aid for dismantling nuclear weapons, and
promoting joint economic activities on the disputed islands.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo and Moscow have yet to break the impasse in their peace
treaty negotiations because of their differences over how to
resolve the territorial row, which concerns four Russia-held
islands off Japan's northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Army Chief Suggests Wiranto to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jakarta, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Army Chief of Staff
Gen. Tyasno Sudarto said on Friday that it is better for Gen.
Wiranto to resign from his cabinet post and follow President
Abdurrahman Wahid's request (to resign).
</P>
<P>
Sudarto made the statement in Bandung, West Java province,
reports reaching here said. The powerful army chief is the first
high-ranking officer to make the suggestion openly.
</P>
<P>
"My personal hope is just like that too (Wiranto resign from
cabinet post). As I have said that the president has a prerogative
right based on constitution and laws. The president can pick and
sack his men, namely his ministers," Sudarto said.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid said on Thursday in Seoul, South Korea, that
several generals in Jakarta would meet Wiranto, who is now
Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security Affairs, to ask
him to resign from his post.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wahid reiterated on Thursday his persistent calls
for Wiranto to resign from his cabinet position for the good of
economy.
</P>
<P>
"If he refuses to step down voluntarily, the country will lose
the opportunity to have investors," the president was quoted by
the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wahid also said that he actually did not want to confront with
Wiranto who was TNI chief when former president Soeharto and
Habibie were in power.
</P>
<P>
"For me, confrontation is not my type of work, it (the
resignation call) is in the interest of Wiranto himself," Wahid
added.
</P>
<P>
General Wiranto has been underfire and facing tough pressure
from many sides to resign following a report issued by the
National Commission on Human Right early this month which accused
him of being responsible for human right abuse in East Timor in
September 1999.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Update CPI Base Year to 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National
Statistics Office (NSO) said Friday that it will update the
consumer price index(CPI) from its base year of 1994 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
NSO Administrator Tomas Africa said this is not only in
response to a growing clamor to update the CPI to reflect the
changing patterns of consumer spending but also as part of its
regular calendar to rebase the CPI periodically.
</P>
<P>
The CPI is the measure of prices at the consumer level for a
fixed basket of goods and services. As a measure to compute
inflation rate,the CPI was last re-based from 1988 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
Africa said the re-basing exercise includes changing the basket
of goods and services whose prices will be monitored from month to
month in more than 9,500 outlets in the country.
</P>
<P>
The weighting pattern, which attaches appropriate importance to
each of the commodities found in this basket, will also be revised.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the re-basing can begin only after the final
results of the Family Income and Expenditure Survey to be
conducted in July 2000 and January 2001 become available.
</P>
<P>
A Commodity and Outlet Survey will also be undertaken in 2001
to establish the most common brands of goods and most patronized
outlets from which prices are to be collected regularly by the NSO.

<HEADLINE> Hijackers Could Face Execution at Home: Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The hijackers of an Afghan
airliner which spent four days at Stansted Airport north of London
could face execution if they return home, said a senior leader of
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
General Rahmatullah Safi, who was at the airport throughout the
negotiations to end the hijacking, said those involved must be
punished, either in a British or an Afghan court.
</P>
<P>
If they were returned to Kabul, he said, they would be tried
under strict Islamic (Sharia) law; and if found guilty they would
be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as groups representing refugees and
asylum seekers called on British Home Secretary Jack Straw not to
deport the 74 passengers who have applied for political asylum in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a chartered plane, belonging to the Kampuchean
Airlines, landed at the Royal Air Force airfield at Brize Norton,
west of London, at around 0700 GMT, to repatriate some 32 freed
hostages, who were believed to be voluntary to return home.
</P>
<P>
There has been widespread speculation that some of the
passengers on board the plane colluded with the hijackers in an
attempt to seek mass asylum.
</P>
<P>
Straw said on Thursday he wanted to see all 150 people who were
on board the Ariana Boeing 727 removed from Britain "as soon as
practicably possible".
</P>
<P>
Speaking in parliament, Straw said he would be taking personal
charge of processing the applications for asylum by 74 of the
passengers - 60 adults and 14 children dependent on them.
</P>
<P>
But confusion reigns about the status of those previously on
the plane.
</P>
<P>
Police are now questioning 22 people about the hijacking, and
have said they cannot rule out further arrests. Aside from the 74
passengers who have already claimed asylum, there are reports that
some or all of the remaining 90 may also apply.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan airliner was hijacked shortly after it took off from
Kabul on Sunday and the plane stopped in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan
and Moscow before landing at Stansted in the small hours on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The hijack ended peacefully before dawn Thursday and all
remaining 150 hostages were released unharmed.

<HEADLINE> Interview: UNCTAD A Golden Chance to Forge Consensus  on Globalization: Thai PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The 10th Session of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X) will offer
a golden opportunity for the world community to forge consensus on
management strategies on globalization, Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai said in a written interview with Xinhua here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The international community should manage the globalization
process in such a way that it will benefit all countries,
developed and developing alike, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
In view of the failure of the World Trade Organization (WTO)'s
Third Ministerial Meeting in Seattle last year, the world is
placing high hopes on UNCTAD X, to be held here from February 12
to 19, as a forum to start the "healing process", Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
"The Seattle meeting seemed to have compelled the international
community to have a cause for concern about the outlook of global
trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD X is expected to patch the cracks left by the Seattle
Meeting, to narrow the gap between rich and poor countries, to
resume talks on globalization, trade liberalization, trade in
services, electronic commerce, competition policy which were not
fruitfully discussed in Seattle, he added.
</P>
<P>
Two documents, the Bangkok Declaration and Plan of Action, will
be issued at the end of the conference, manifesting the common
stance of the 188 member states on potentials and risks of
globalization, the strategies in managing it, and the commitment
of the international community to pursue a new approach to global
cooperation as well as UNCTAD work program for the next four years,
Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
As a country which has gone through hard times for the last two
years during the financial crisis, Thailand will figure highly the
issue of prevention of recurrence of the economic crisis at the
conference, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will hold a symposium on economic and financial
recovery in Asia on February 17.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has keen anticipation for UNCTAD X, because in one
hand, the conference will boost Thailand's tourism industry with
the coming of the expected 3,000 to 4,000 delegation, another 3,
000 to 4,000 spouses and family members, and 1,000 to 2,000
foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand and more importantly, the meeting will be an
opportunity to show to the world that Thailand has recovered from
the worst economic crisis in recent memory, the fact that should
help restore investors' confidence in the kingdom and the region,
Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
"After UNCTAD X, Thailand will be President of UNCTAD X for
four years, which will call for increased international
responsibility from the kingdom and at the same time further
elevate Thailand's profile in the international arena," he said.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD X, dabbed the world's first global economic gathering in
the new millennium, was attached great importance to by the Thai
government, Chuan said, noting that preparation has been underway
for more than one year.
</P>
<P>
"A national committee chaired by myself was set up for the
Conference. Two sub-committees were later established to look
after the logistical arrangement and the substantive part," he
said.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the security of the delegates, Thailand is said to
have mobilized some 6,600 policemen during the conference at the
convention center.
</P>
<P>
As Chuan put it, it is an opportunity of immense importance to
inject political commitment into UNCTAD X deliberations, through
which the long-term role of UNCTAD in the international arena will
be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also serve as a celebration for the return
of Asia as economic force for the next millennium, Chuan said.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Urged to Meet Investigation Summon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Former president Soeharto
should meet his office's summons for undergoing further
investigation on corruption cases, Indonesian Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Former president Soeharto, who now is a suspect in corruption
cases during his rule, should be present to meet the Attorney
General Office's call. But if it is proved later that the suspect
can not be present (due to health reason), it will be considered,"
Darusman was quoted by the Suara Pembaruan daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said that if Soeharto fails to come to the Attorney
General Office, his side may send investigators to Soeharto's
house to continue its investigation.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a real reason from Soeharto's medical team to
explain why Soeharto can't come to meet the Attorney General
Office's call," Darusman stressed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, chief of Soeharto's legal defender team
Juan Felix Tampubolon said that his client will not come to
undergo investigation on Monday due to health reason.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, he said, now still has problems with his
communication skill, both spoken and written, after suffered
stroke and intestinal bleeding last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Speaker of the House of Representatives (DPR) Akbar
Tandjung also expected the Attorney General Office to consider the
health of the former president Soeharto in summoning him.
</P>
<P>
"We should realize that his (Soeharto's) physical condition is
very poor, and he is greatly handicapped in communicating,"
Tandjung was quoted by Antara news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
In further developments, a legal expert J.E. Sahetapy said that
the decision of the Attorney General Office which put Soeharto as
a suspect in corruption case was an answer to public demands.
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning, probably there will be no clarity whether
Soeharto committed corruption practices or not, but at the end,
all will be proved that Soeharto has really committed KKN (a local
acronym for corruption, collusion and nepotistic practices)," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sahetapy, however, suggested that the Attorney General Office
should send a medical team to check the information made by
Soeharto's medical team.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that Soeharto and his family have amassed at
least 15 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Cannot Accept Annan's Demands, Hun Sen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 11 (Xinhua) -- As a sovereignty country,
Cambodia will never accept Annan's demands set out in his letter
on the trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders, Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"If we agreed with Annan, we will become a stooge, that is
unacceptable," Hun Sen stressed, adding "Cambodia is a sovereignty
country, we are masters of the country, our right must be
respected."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remarks at the airport before departure for
Bangkok to attend the Tenth Session of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTD) from February 11 to 14.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's remarks were apparently referring to Kofi
Annan's letter sent to him on Tuesday which demands Cambodia to
meet his four requirements, such as an independent international
prosecutor, a majority of U.N.-appointed judges, to guarantee the
arrest of any suspect indicated by the court and to clarify an
amnesty clause. But they were rejected by Hun Sen Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen on Thursday forwarded a terse letter to Kofi Annan,
saying he is "surprised by the gap" that remains between the
government and the United Nations on the trial, noting that "it is
unfair to Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
It was confirmed that Prime Minister Hun Sen, during his stay
in Bangkok, would meet with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
discuss a trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said that he would still like to hold a
constructive position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen was accompanied by Foreign Minister Hor Namhong,
Minister of Cabinet Sok An, Finance Minister Keat Chhon, Commerce
Minister Cham Prasidh.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the official opening ceremony of the U.N. meeting, Hun
Sen will attend the roundtable discussion (ASEAN and U.N. summit)
on Saturday and will address the plenary session of UNCTD on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hun Sen will also deliver a speech on "Cambodia
Investment 2000: New Investment Policies for the New Millennium"
at a meeting with Joint Chambers of Commerce, according to the
press release by the Foreign Ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of 17,629
hectares of forests on Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest in Africa,
have been devastated by bush fires over the past seven years,
Tanzanian newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fires caused untold environmental destruction in the
region, including pollution, wiping of natural vegetation and live
animals, Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism Zakia Meghji
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the period under review, the ministry in collaboration

<HEADLINE> Ghana Sets up Special Fund for AIDS Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Ghana is to establish a
special fund for HIV/AIDS prevention and control, the First Lady,
Nana Konadu Agyeman Rawlings, has said.
</P>
<P>
Nana Konadu, who was launching a national campaign against
HIV/AIDS in Ghana, said on Thursday the fund is among various
strategies being considered by the government to provide an
effective response to the menace.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that more than 200 people are
infected with the HIV virus daily in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
The figures also reveal that 71 per cent of the 33,919 AIDS
cases recorded in Ghana from 1986 to 1999 fall within ages of 15
to 39. Nana Konadu said evidence on the ground shows that
public education on the disease has been successful in creating
awareness, "however, many have not changed their attitude and
lifestyles".
</P>
<P>
As a national initiative, the campaign aimed at checking the
spread of AIDS is a new strategy to cover all communities and age
groups, especially the young people who are mostly hard hit.
</P>
<P>
She said the onslaught of AIDS is denting the prospects for
economic development in many African countries, including Ghana
where 85 percent of all infections occur through normal sexual
intercourse.
</P>
<P>
"Let us declare the year 2000 as the window of opportunity to
slow the spread of this menace and avoid the massive epidemic that
now affects other parts of Africa where prevalence is as high as
20 percent," she said.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence in Switzerland Sets New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The index of Swiss consumer
confidence reached 18 points in January, the highest level since
1989, according to the latest figures released by the Economics
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly index, which is compiled from a survey among 1,
100 households throughout the country, stood at eight points in
October, compared to minus two points a year before.
</P>
<P>
Those questioned are even more optimistic about the future of
the economy, a factor not taken into account in compiling the
consumer confidence index. But the households questioned pushed a
separate index relating to the outlook to 37 points last month,
the highest since the fourth quarter of 1972.
</P>
<P>
The Economics Ministry said that the perception of job security
is stagnating at -37 points but this is a marked improvement over
the -62 figure recorded a year ago.
</P>
<P>
It added that consumers are more confident now than three
months ago about making major purchases for such items as cars,
furniture and household appliances.
</P>
<P>
However, households believe that prices have increased
considerably over the past few months and they expect that
inflation will rise.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Institute for Business Cycle Research at the Federal
Institute for Technology in Zurich said Thursday that it was
upbeat about the economy, forecasting a growth of almost two
percent for the first six months of the year.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid Thursday
added an item on March's Arab League Council's agenda to hold Arab
summits regularly.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference, he said the League has pondered over this
issue because the League's Charter does not include any item about
convening the summits. The highest authority in the Arab League is
the Arab Foreign Ministers' Council. The last pan-Arab summit was
held in Cairo in 1996 upon the call of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt has a main role in such consultations because
President Hosni Mubarak was the president of last summit.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The second Egyptian satellite, Nilesat 102, will be launched
into orbit in July by an Ariane rocket from Kourou space center in
French Guiana.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, built by the Toulouse-based Matra Marconi
Company, will carry 12 digital channels with a beaming capacity of
72 television slots.
</P>
<P>
The new satellite, along with Nilesat 101, makes up the first
generation of Egyptian satellites and will be sent into the same
orbit as 101 at seven degrees to the west.
</P>
<P>
The satellites have a life-span of 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- The cabinet held its meeting Thursday under Prime Minister
Atef Ebeid, saying Egypt's policy as a pivotal country would
continue.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet said the attempts carried out by foreign minority
would not prejudice Egypt's firm attitudes and will.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cabinet, the security agencies would continue
efforts to unveil the attempts against legitimacy and firmly track
down the crime and its perpetrators under the law and constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- A report discussed by the Cabinet Thursday said that an
Egyptian pilot, who is seeking political asylum in Britain, had no
information about the crash of an EgyptAir airliner into the
Atlantic Ocean late last October.
</P>
<P>
"The report said that EgyptAir will adopt all legal procedures
at the international level in order to face the deliberate attempt
to cast doubts on the performance of the company," said Information
Minister Safwat el-Sharif in a briefing after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The report was presented by the transport minister. EgyptAir
pilot Hamdi Taha requested asylum in the United Kingdom last week
upon landing at Heathrow airport.

<HEADLINE> Iran Celebrates Revolution as Election Campaign Goes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Iranians poured into
streets on Friday, turning the 21st anniversary celebration of the
1979 Islamic revolution into a political arena for the forthcoming
sensitive parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Tehran, people gathered in a grand rally
around the Azadi (Freedom) Square where the moderate President
Mohammad Khatami urged for a massive turnout in the elections.
</P>
<P>
"It is the time for you to show a massive turnout again and to
play a historical role in determining the fate of the country by
casting your votes in the elections," Khatami told the audience.
</P>
<P>
He called on people to turn February 18 (parliamentary election)
into another May 23, the 1997 presidential election in which
Khatami won a landslide victory over the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
By taking advantage of the celebration, rival political parties
put on placards and posters along streets with their slogans for
the balloting, which many believe will create a new balance of
power in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Iran for all Iranians," read the placards of the Islamic Iran
Participation Front (IIPF) headed by Mohammad Reza Khatami, brother
of the moderate president.
</P>
<P>
"The year of Imam (the late supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi
Khomeini), and the Majlis (Parliament) of Imam," posters of
conservative parties said.
</P>
<P>
Both the moderate and conservative factions launched their
election campaigns months ago, though the official, week-long
election campaign was kicked off on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The moderates, who support the president, hope to win a majority
in the Majlis to push forward Khatami's reformist programs. The
conservatives, on the other hand, expect to stay on and continue
their dominance over main state organs.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also called on rival factions to carry out their
campaigns based on national interests and with healthy competitions
within the limits of laws.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Khatami's call, hard-liners shouted slogans showing
their allegiance to the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and
their opposition to a rapprochement between Iran and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Burning U.S. flags at the Azadi Square, the hard-liners
shouted "Death to the U.S." and "Ties with the U.S., Never."
</P>
<P>
A six-point resolution read out at the end of the rally called
for unity among different political parties and groups ahead of the
parliamentary election and urged people to elect those loyal to the
Islamic revolution to the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the government and relevant officials to take
measures against foreign cultural invasion and to provide necessary
facilities to defend the Islamic values in all fields.

<HEADLINE> hke021138 --UNCTAD Should Be Given Definitive Role: Thai Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Post-Bangkok United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will function as a
focal point to carry on with dialogues on the consequences of
globalization and liberalization, Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference together with Secretary-
General of UNCTAD Rubens Ricupero, Supachai said UNCTAD has been
moving more and more in the direction of being a research and
knowledge base institution, and only in that direction can UNCTAD
make itself more useful to the world community.
</P>
<P>
The 10th session of UNCTAD will be held from February 12 to 19
in Bangkok. The meeting will address the broad theme of "applying
the lessons of the past to make globalization an effective
instrument for the development of all countries and of all people.
"
</P>
<P>
In recent years UNCTAD has been working to shift its role to
help developing countries to face the challenges arising from
globalization and to better integrate into the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, also designate president of UNCTAD and director-
general-in-waiting of the World Trade Organization (WTO), said the
shifting role of UNCTAD would be able to make itself to complement
the work of other international institutions such as WTO.
</P>
<P>
He said with definite task given, post-Bangkok UNCTAD will be
able to help bring about the benefits from liberalization and
globalization process, so that all participating economies in this
global process can be integrated as efficiently and beneficially
as possible.
</P>
<P>
He disagrees with the thinking that UNCTAD should be more
pertinent and more assertive with its role, instead he believes
that UNCTAD should be given a definitive role in the process of
guiding the world economies in the direction of globalization and
liberalization.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Government Rejects Referendum Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
rejected the opposition's demand for delaying the referendum on
whether to adopt multi- party system which was scheduled for June
this year.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs Mayanja Nkangi
said that delaying the referendum for six months would mean the
1995 Constitution should be amended, the New Vision daily reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Constitution, the referendum will be held during the
last month of the fourth year of the present Parliament which was
inaugurated in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
A group of opposition party members advocating introduction of
multi- party politics in Uganda demanded that the referendum be
postponed so that all the contending sides could get equal funding
and better prepare for it.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that even if the opposition parties boycott
the referendum, it would still be held in time.

<HEADLINE> 300 Turkish Teachers Fired for Wearing Headscarves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Over 300 primary and secondary
school teachers have been dismissed by the Education Ministry for
violating dress code, reported the Anatolia News Agency on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Metin Bostancioglu charged that the teachers,
in defiance of the ministry's dress code, insisted on wearing
Islamic-style headscarves to work.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all civil servants were obliged to abide by the
dress code and fundamentalist or radical activities will not be
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
"According to the Council of State, if a civil servant gets
involved in radical activities, he or she must be dismissed, and,
as a result, the 300 teachers involved in such activities have been
let go," explained the minister.
</P>
<P>
Referring to lawsuits in this respect, Bostancioglu mentioned
the fact that court appeals filed by some civil servants who were
fired have been rejected. "There is no need to discuss the subject
if they take part in these activities," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that "This is a crime, the punishment of
which is dismissal from civil service. Everybody must comply with
this rule. If they don't, they have no place among us."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 11 private dormitories in Izmir, southwestern Turkey,
which reportedly were used for fundamentalist activities have been
closed down and the 250 students stying there transferred to other
lodgings.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the recent flare-up in South Lebanon, the U.S
believes Syrian-Israeli peace talks can resume soon and is focusing
on persuading working groups of experts to come to the U.S. as a
means of breaking the ice.
</P>
<P>
The groups were originally due to come to Washington late last
month after higher-level talks broke down over a dispute over
Israeli's willingness to withdraw form the Golan Heights to the
June 4, 1967 line.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The five-nation monitoring committee set up after Israel's
Operation Grapes of Wrath is to meet Friday to work for an easing
of tension in South Lebanon after Israel gave its go-ahead for the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Amid clear signs that the worst of this week's conflict may be
over, the Israel Defense Forces Thursday confined air and artillery
bombardments to the front line of the security zone while Hezbollah
confirmed that it had chosen not to fire Katyusha rockets into the
northern Galilee.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz Thursday denied a French
media report that guerrillas had sent Israel "anatomical evidence"
about missing Air Force navigator Ron Arad.
</P>
<P>
According to the French media reports, the guerrillas had passed
a part of body to Israel via German diplomats last month.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Justice Ministry sources say that after millionaire Edouard
Saroussi and President Ezer Weizman were questioned separately by
police interrogators, there are apparently no signs of bribery in
the case involving hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars funneled
by the French businessman to Weizman.
</P>
<P>
But there may be enough evidence to charge Weizman with
violation of tax laws and the law forbids public officials to
accept gifts, the sources say.
</P>
<P>
The president, his wife Reuma, and his longtime aide and
Director-General Aryeh Shumer were questioned at length Thursday by
six top fraud squad investigators.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeeping Plays "Proud Role" : Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 11 (Xinhua) -- In a world still riven by
conflict, there is a proud role for peacekeeping, the United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan told Thai university students
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remark when delivering a speech on U.N.
peacekeeping after Thailand's Thammasat University conferred him a
Ph.D degree on political science honoris causa.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing U.N.'s success peacekeeping missions and Thailand's
participation in them, Annan said peacekeeping has changed
dramatically over the years.
</P>
<P>
"Until 10 or 15 years ago, U.N. forces were usually interposed
between belligerent parties to monitor a cease-fire, or to report
on the implementation of a peace agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But in recent years, we have also organized elections,
demobilized rebel forces, repatriated refugees and been deeply
involved in reconstruction and institution-building. These multi-
dimensional operations are now the norm," he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting setbacks in U.N. peacekeeping missions in Rwanda and
Bosnia, Annan pointed out rooms for the United Nations to improve
in its peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations needs rapid response capacity,
because" at present it is as if when a fire breaks out, we must
first build a fire station in order to respond."
</P>
<P>
For many years, the Unite Nations has been seeking to build a
reliable system in which trained and equipped troops are available
immediately after the Security Council's decision to establish an
operation, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
However, in practice, the so-called "stand-by" arrangement have
not proven themselves to be enough to meet the challenge of rapid
deployment, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The core capacities of the peacekeeping department of the U.N.
Secretariat, which had been built up during the mid-1990s, have
been pared back to an unacceptable level," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Also in short supply, he said, are the necessary civilian
personnel, namely police, judges, administrators, needed for today
's complex operations.
</P>
<P>
When answering question from a student concerning the United
Nations' financial status, Annan said the his organization still
got financial problems and is trying to find resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He urged member states to pay their dues without any conditions,
saying it is their legal obligation.
</P>
<P>
Annan is here for a four-day visit to Thailand, during which he
will attend the 10th Session of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD X), to be held here during February
12 to 19.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The tourism sector of Ho Chi
Minh City has resumed its development after two years suffering
declines, Vietnam News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The tourism sector of the largest Vietnamese city earned 325.5
billion Vietnamese dong (23.3 million U.S. dollars) in January, a
year-on-year increase of 50.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sector set a goal of receiving 1.1 million foreign visitors
this year, an increase of 12.8 percent over 1999.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the sector has increased tours to the Mekong delta
and historical relics and boosted ecological tourism.
</P>
<P>
The city has opened tours to Phnom Penh by land transport and
possibly by waterways.
</P>
<P>
There are in the city 175 travel agencies and 1,000 businesses
providing accommodations in the city.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Can't Undergo Investigation: Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto will not come to the Attorney General Office on Monday to
undergo an investigation on corruption cases due to health reasons,
chief of Soeharto's legal defender team Juan Felix Tampubolon said
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tampubolon said at the Attorney General Office that Soeharto
now still has problems with his communication ability, since the
78-years old man suffered a stroke last year.
</P>
<P>
"Medically, it is impossible for pak (Mr.) Soeharto to undergo
the investigation," Tampubolon told reporters, without elaborating
when is the right time for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Director for Corruption Cases at the Attorney General Office
Chairul Imam said Thursday that his office had send a letter to
Soeharto to ask him come to the office next Monday (February 14)
for further investigation on corruption cases. The Office said it
had found new evidences about Soeharto's corruption during his 32
years rule.
</P>
<P>
However Tampubolon declined to reveal in detail on Soeharto's
health condition, adding that ethically such a disclosure is not
proper to be published.
</P>
<P>
Tampubolon added that Soeharto still has problems with
communication skills both written and spoken, but actually
Soeharto really wants to met Attorney General Office's call.
</P>
<P>
"Pak Harto (Mr. Soeharto) talked to us that he actually wants
to come and met the Attorney General Office's call, because he
wants to obey the country's law but his doctor team has said that
it is impossible for Pak Harto to do so," Tampubolon said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down in May 1998, and suffered a
stroke in July 1999 and intestinal bleeding the following month.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said Soeharto and his family have amassed at
least 15 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Eyes Windows 2000 Pirates Before Official Unveiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp., the
world's largest software maker, said Thursday that it has been
busy stamping out Web sites offering illicit copies of its Windows
2000, which has not even been officially released.
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is use technology even more to combat
software piracy," said Anne Murphy, an anti-piracy attorney for
the Redmond, a Washington-based company.
</P>
<P>
Windows 2000, the upgraded business operating system that took
Microsoft 1 billion U.S. dollars and three years to develop, is to
be formally unveiled by Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder and
chairman, next Thursday in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
But copies of Windows 2000 were sent to computer makers for
installation on new computers last December, and machines carrying
it have been quietly shipped for several weeks, according to the
world's software giant.
</P>
<P>
Beta, or test versions, were also released to hundreds of
thousands of customers months ago.
</P>
<P>
Using a new program that works full-time at ferreting out
illegal copies of Windows 2000 on the Web, Microsoft in January
alone uncovered more than 100 Web sites posting the program for
download, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
"It searches out those downloads and the following day our
people review the results of the search, and if it looks like
there's a serious problem, then we notify in rapid time the
Internet service provider," Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear how many copies of Windows 2000 have been
downloaded illegally or how much money Microsoft has lost from
such an activity.
</P>
<P>
"We really haven't quantified that," Murphy said of losses due
to Windows 2000 piracy. The software's price tag ranges from $149
for a desktop upgrade to $3,999 for the Advanced Server version.
</P>
<P>
To combat the piracy, which has been made easier by the
Internet, Microsoft has assembled an arsenal of new weapons,
including a virtual bloodhound to sniff out illegal copies lurking
on the Web, holographic CD-ROMs and authenticity certificates that
are harder to counterfeit than a 100-dollar bill, experts say.
</P>
<P>
According to the Business Software Alliance, more than 2
million Web sites are selling or distributing pirated software and
numerous sites are posting beta copies of Windows 2000 for
download.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to crack down on this increasing problem,
Microsoft is also launching an aggressive Internet monitoring
program to specifically address sites that post Microsoft software
for illegal downloading.
</P>
<P>
Also, Windows 2000 will ship with verification badges using a
copper holographic thread, unique identification numbers, and a
company logo that shimmers gold and silver in the light.

<HEADLINE> IOC Member Says SOCOG Revenue Targets Too Ambitious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Sydney Organizing
Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) had set ambitious revenue
targets they were unable to meet, senior International Olympic
Committee (IOC) member Jacques Rogge said Friday in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
But Rogge, chairman of the IOC Co-ordination Commission, gave a
glowing assessment of Sydney's Games preparations.
</P>
<P>
The Commission will begin its 10th meeting about preparations
for the Sydney Games in Sydney Saturday, one of the IOC's last
opportunities to make significant changes to 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Rogge said there had been "hiccups" in preparations for Sydney,
particularly ticketing, but saw no serious problems.
</P>
<P>
He said the IOC had told SOCOG three years ago that the
organizers were "too ambitious" in their revenue predictions.
</P>
<P>
Failure to meet those predictions contributed to SOCOG's 193-
million-Australian dollar (127.4 million U.S. dollars) budget
deficit earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
But Rogge said the IOC had to trust SOCOG's confidence of being
able to achieve their targets.
</P>
<P>
"You have to be ambitious when you are involved in the Olympic
Games," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said it was heartening to see the infrastructure
in place.
</P>
<P>
Forty items will be reviewed, including the budget cuts SOCOG
is still to make, transport, and the shifting of operational
strategy of the Games to actual delivery.
</P>
<P>
Rogge said it was important for athletes as well as the IOC
that Sydney be a success after the recent scandals surrounding the
organization.
</P>
<P>
The co-ordination commission will meet for the last time in
June, only three months from the Opening ceremony.

<HEADLINE> E-commerce to Boost Australia's GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Widespread take-up of e-
commerce could add 2.7 percent to Australia's gross domestic
product (GDP), push wages up by three percent and cut prices by up
to 20 percent over 10 years, a new report said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Research by the National Office for the Information Economy (
NOIE) into the economic impacts of electronic commerce found that
while it would not boost all industries, the benefits would exceed
the costs.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce would free up resources and increase productivity,
boosting consumption by 10 billion Australian dollars (6.6 billion
U.S. dollars), increasing employment and fueling the tourism and
leisure industries, the NOIE found.
</P>
<P>
The NOIE's report predicted that Internet-based commerce in
Australia would grow from 61 million Australian dollars (40.3
million U.S. dollars) in 1997 to 1.3 billion Australian dollars (
858 million U.S. dollars) next year.
</P>
<P>
The main beneficiaries of the boom would be entertainment,
transport and communication, with flow-on effects to banking,
health and education.
</P>
<P>
But shops would suffer as buyers made increasing use of the
Internet, slashing average retail margins by up to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Books are viewed as being particularly susceptible to this
impact and so margins in that industry fall by 30 percent," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Wages would rise by up to three percent because of increased
efficiency, and employment would increase by about 0.5 percent
overall, it said.
</P>
<P>
Jobs growth would be concentrated in entertainment, tourism,
hospitality, building, communication trades and health, while
retailing, textiles, clothing and footwear, banking and printing
would lose jobs, the report said.

NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign experts have warned
against the dumping of raw sewage into Lake Victoria surrounded by
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
It has posed a danger to people's lives and the lake's
ecosystem, the participants to an international seminar on Lake
Victoria being held in Kisumu, Kenya, stressed.

The sewage was the major cause of the proliferation of the
water hyacinth weed in the lake, which has stifled other aquatic
plants and disrupted fishing and shipping, the East African
Standard newspaper Friday quoted Jon-Olof Drangert, an expert from
the Linkompings University of Sweden, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"After touring a local sewage plant we were shocked to find the
plant has not been operational for the last two years," Drangert
said.
</P>
<P>
Raw sewage, which contains pathogens, are also responsible for
many water-borne diseases, other experts warned at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The seminar participants from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania have
called for concerted efforts to eradicate the pollution.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Boost Tourism Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
considering giving priority to the development of the tourism
sector, Environment and Tourism Minister Simon Kaya Moyo has
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception to mark the opening of the Travel Expo
in Harare on Thursday, Moyo said the tourism industry has become a
top foreign exchange earner in Zimbabwe, with a vast potential
employment to improve the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
To boost the tourism industry, he said, the country had
embarked on a program to refurbish most entry points at Victoria
Falls, Kariba Lake and Bulawayo.
</P>
<P>
The government is also finalizing the modalities of
establishing a revolving tourism fund since tourism was high on
the government agenda, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the number of foreign arrivals amounted to more than
two million, bringing about 160 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Higher Housing Prices Force People Out Of Silicon Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 10 (Xinhua) -- More people are moving
out of Silicon Valley than moving in, California officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"About 1,000 more people moved out than moved in," Sandy
Harrison, a spokesman for California's Department of Finance,
explained the new population figures released by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
California's latest census figures showed Santa Clara County --
home to computer and software firms in the Silicon Valley --
experienced a net loss of population in 1999 once natural growth
through births and deaths was discounted.
</P>
<P>
Harrison said overall about 13,000 people moved out of Silicon
Valley bound for other parts of the United States in 1999. These
were partially offset by 11,800 new arrivals from overseas, which
has been a major source of new workers for the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
The last time Silicon Valley lost people was in the early 1990s
when California's economy was in recession.
</P>
<P>
But the valley as a whole remains vibrant, according to Stephen
Levy, director of the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study
of the California Economy. He said the statistics should not be
misinterpreted as a sign that the region's stunning growth will
slow.
</P>
<P>
"Last year we had a tripling of venture capital start-up money,
so people's thoughts about the future are enormously positive,"
Levy said. "This is not a declining area economically. At the same
time, the cumulative difficulties in building homes have pushed
workers out of the county to find new housing."
</P>
<P>
The rocketing real estate prices might be one of major reasons
behind the net loss of middle class population in Santa Clara
County, where the median house price has reached 420,000 U.S.
dollars, much higher than the averages in the State of California
or the country.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that most houses draw multiple bids from
frantic buyers, many offering tens of thousands of dollars above
the asking price.
</P>
<P>
In response to the squeeze, some companies have moved "back
office" operations out of the area while workers are forced to
move to neighboring counties to find affordable housing.

<HEADLINE> China's Cotton Exports Beat Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China has become a net raw
cotton exporter with its net exports totaling 190,000 tons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The country earned 280 million U.S. dollars from cotton exports
last year, four times more than in the previous year, "China Daily
" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that global cotton output increased about five
percent last year while the demand grew only 1.2 percent, Chinese
companies are stepping up their exports of the products. They say
the country is a universally acknowledged leading supplier of
cotton products.
</P>
<P>
Given the large domestic supply and high costs of cotton
inventories of Chinese companies, the Chinese Agriculture Ministry
and other relevant agriculture departments estimate this year's
output may drop further to 3.2 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Cotton growers, whose production enthusiasm was dampened by the
government's deregulation of purchasing prices during the
harvesting season, are seeking cooperation with foreign traders to
increase profits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's imports of raw cotton plummeted 76.5 percent
year-on-year to reach 46,000 tons in 1999 as a result of
government's severe crackdown on smugglers and the requirement
that all ginned cotton and cotton products imported as raw
materials must be re-exported as finished products.

<HEADLINE> Flowers Bestowed As Gifts During Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I have sold over 2,000 pots of chrysanthemum during the Spring
Festival period," said Wang Jintang, a florist in his sixties.
</P>
<P>
Wang started preparations months ago as he predicted good sales
during the seven Spring Festivbal holidays. He invested more than
200,000 yuan (about 24,000 U.S. dollars) in purchasing saplings
and hired 8 gardeners to take care of them.
</P>
<P>
Wang has six greenhouses, over 100,000 pots of flowers. His
flowers sell well across China. Wang makes an annual income of
around 300,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
And most of the flowers in a market in Urumqi, the capital of
the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang, are transported from
south China's Yunnan and Shenzhen. Some even come from Israel and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Flowers of all kinds have sold extremely well during the Spring
Festival holidays in spite of higher prices due to snowfalls in
Kunming, southwest China's Yunnan Province. As a main flower
production and wholesale base in China, the province provides
flowers to over 20 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
Surveys from east China's Jiangsu Province show that 40 percent
of residents will choose flowers as gifts for their friends
during the holidays. Twentytwo percent will send flowers as
birthday gifts while 48 percent will give flowers to the sick.
</P>
<P>
Flowers and books have become a new addition to traditional
gifts such as poultry, meat, clothing, cookies and wine during the
Chinese Spring Festival holidays.

<HEADLINE> Balance between Rights and Obligations on China's entry to WTO (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Generally speaking, obligations should be equal to rights, and
we will not accept demands beyond our capability, instead achieve
a basic balance between rights and obligations," says a signed
article carried by today's People's Daily, organ newspaper of the
Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
China has adhered to the principle of a balance between rights
and obligations since 1986, when it began negotiations on applying
for the restoration of a membership in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and joining the WTO, says the article,
entitled Correctly Apprehending the Balance Between Rights and
Obligations in China's Entry to WTO.
</P>
<P>
China has followed such a principle and reached "win-win"
agreements with more than 20 countries on its entry to the WTO,
thus safeguarding national interests and reflecting WTO's request,
it says.
</P>
<P>
According to the principle, it adds, China will enjoy the most-
favored-nation trading status in a multilateral, stable and
unconditional manner and outcomes of trade liberalization,
participate in setting down international trade regulations, and
safeguard its national rights and interests by using WTO
multilateral trade dispute settlement mechanism as soon as it
joins the global trading system.

<P>
On the other hand, China should fulfill its obligations,
including following the WTO regulations in making laws and
regulations, increasing transparency, reducing administrative
intervention, gradually lowering tariffs and eliminating non-
tariff measures and gradually opening the service industry, it
notes.
</P>
<P>
China's membership in the WTO and adherence to WTO's
regulations and fulfillment of market openness commitments will
provide better and more stable market access opportunities for its
trading partners, the article says, adding that investment areas
will be further expanded, foreign-invested enterprises will
gradually enjoy national treatment, and investment environment
will be more favorable, transparent and stable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, WTO members should fulfill their obligations for
China, thus laying a stable basis for the growth of economic and
trade relations between China and other countries.
</P>
<P>
More Chinese enterprises and products will enter others'
markets conveniently after it joins the WTO, while providing
greater market access for other WTO members, it says.
</P>
<P>
China should participate in formaulating international
multilateral trading regulations, while it is restricted by such
regulations and adapts relevant laws, regulations and policies.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China can use dispute settlement mechanism of the
World Trade Organization to seek a fair settlement of trade
dispute, while following its arbitrament, the article says.

<HEADLINE> More Central Bank Loans Earmarked for Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank plans to
provide another 80 billion yuan (nearly 10 billion U.S. dollars)
in loans this year for major development projects in four
southwest China provinces.
</P>
<P>
The recipients are Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan provinces and the
Tibet Autonomous Region, four of western China's 10 poorest
provincial areas targeted by the central government for wide-
ranging support in an ambitious regional development program.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the central bank's regional center
told Xinhua the increased figure represents 12 percent growth over
the 1999 loan figure.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan is expected to receive 52.9 billion yuan (6.3 billion U.
S. dollars) in additional loans, Guizhou, 10.6 billion yuan (1.3
billion U.S. dollars), Yunnan, 15.9 billion yuan (1.9 billion U.S.
dollars), and Tibet, 600 million yuan (72 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The official with Chengdu Branch of the People's Bank of China
said that in regard to loan distribution, priority is given to
projects involving infrastructure construction, ecological
conservation, market-oriented high-tech industries, and
development programs in areas densely populated by ethnic minority
groups.
</P>
<P>
The branch will also encourage closer cooperation between the
country's developed east and developing west when considering
issuing loans.
</P>
<P>
He said 176 infrastructure projects under construction in the
four provincial areas will be top priority when issuing loans.
</P>
<P>
The projects, whose estimated costs total 191.8 billion yuan (
23.1 U.S. dollars), include expressways, railways, airports,
natural gas pipelines, water conservancy and power transmission
networks, telecommunications, and radio and television
transmission facilities.

<HEADLINE> Support Rate for New Ruling Party in New Zealand Surges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Party vote support for the
Labor Party, the new major ruling party in New Zealand, has leapt
to 45 percent in the latest National Business Review (NBR) opinion
poll.
</P>
<P>
This is the first major poll since the general election held in
last November. In the election, the Labor Party defeated the
National Party and became the major ruling party in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the poll, which was released here
Friday, the number of people thinking the country is on the right
track has also risen to 59 percent, the highest rating the NBR
poll has recorded since it started asking the question in March
1995.
</P>
<P>
The support rate for the Labor Party has risen from just under
39 percent at the election.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the Labor Party has come at the expense of its
major rival, the National Party, and some other smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
The support rate for the National Party has fallen to 29
percent from 30.5 percent at the election. Small parties, such as
Alliance, ACT and NZ First, have all lost ground.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 750 people was taken between January 27 and 30 and
has an estimated margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Oil, Gas Hunt Moves Accelerated in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The hunt for billions of
dollars worth of oil and gas is heating up in Taranaki on west
coast of New Zealand's North Island.
</P>
<P>
According to recent reports by local media, Fletcher Challenge
Energy's long-delayed Pohukura-1 well off north Taranaki has
started drilling a potential gas field that could be worth between
860 million to 1.7 billion New Zealand dollars (430 million to 0.
85 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Fletcher Energy was quoted as saying that a gas field at
Pohukura could be about one tenth the size of the huge Maui
offshore field which has about two-thirds of New Zealand's
estimated economically recoverable gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
The present estimate of the potential reserve suggest enough to
fuel New Zealand's gas demand for two years, extending the life of
the Methanex methanol operation by many years. Pohukura is
targeting potential reserves of 430 billion cubic feet of gas.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, New Zealand Oil and Gas (NZOG) said it is
drilling its "most important exploration well in years" in the
West Maui permit offshore the Taranaki Basin.
</P>
<P>
NZOG said the Hochstetter well has the potential for recovery
of 145 million barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
NZOG Chairman Tony Radford was quoted as hoping that a
discovery at Hochstetter would support the concept that the entire
Western Trend including three big prospects Hochstetter, Hector
and Tahuroa are part of a big new oil fairway with the potential
to produce several billion barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand is self-sufficient in all energy forms apart from
oil.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Military (TNI)
plans to enhance its arsenal and manpower reserves amidst security
disturbances and social unrest in the country, a TNI chief said.
</P>
<P>
The program would focus on personnel recruitment and weaponry
purchase, which will cost the government no less than 178 billion
rupiah (24 million U.S. dollars) in the upcoming fiscal year
starts in April, TNI Commander Adm. Widodo told the House of
Representatives (DPR) on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
"If the House fails to approve the proposal, it is certain that
TNI will lack preparedness capability," Widodo added.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the government proposed to the House a more than 10
percent increase in overall defense and security expenditures,
setting the budget at 10.1 trillion rupiah (about 1.44 billion
dollars) for the fiscal year 2000 (April to December).
</P>
<P>
In the last fiscal year which covered 12 months, the budget was
set at 12.2 trillion rupiah (about 1.74 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Widodo said that TNI had allocated 63 billion rupiah (9 million
dollars) to recruit 11,500 army soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The recruitment expenditure makes up nearly 56.7 percent of the
total budget for the army, Widodo said, adding that the Navy has
also disclosed a long-term plan to build its troops to 70,000
within five years, in accordance with its goal of expanding the
Marines force.
</P>
<P>
Widodo also said that TNI has some 250,000 personnel in three
forces.
</P>
<P>
Also included in this year's budget are the purchase of two
warship of Parchim class, Widodo said, adding the Air Force has
also requested to modify seven F-16 combat planes.

<HEADLINE> Drug Control Program Achieves Success in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A sub-regional drug control
program of reducing illicit drug use in the highlands of East Asia,
being implemented at six villages in Myanmar's northern Shan state
and Kachin state, has achieved 80 percent success, official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The program is carried out by Myanmar's Central Committee for
Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC) and the U.N. Drug Control Program (
UNDCP) simultaneously at two villages in Shan state's Muse area
and four villages in Kachin state's Bhamo area under a sub-region
by six memorandum of understanding (MOU) countries -- China,
Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The program, which started implementation in June 1997, will
end in June 2000, the report said, adding that similar programs
will be carried out in other villages with contribution of donor
nations.
</P>
<P>
The present program is using 1.52 million U.S. dollars provided
by Britain and the UNDCP, involving the contribution of Japan, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The project of reducing illicit drug use in the highlands of
East Asia is one of the two projects signed in 1996 in Yangon by
senior officials of the six MOU countries. The other project deals
with precursor control in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The six-country memorandum of understanding (MOU), involving
the UNDCP, on control of illicit drug trafficking and abuse in the
sub-region was initiated in October 1993 at the U.N. Headquarters
in New York.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Opposition Pushes for Constitutional Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition
the United National Party (UNP) has asked President Chandrika
Kumaratunga to table in Parliament immediately the proposed
constitutional reforms to end the country's 17-year-old ethnic
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"We are amazed that instead of finalizing and tabling the draft
constitution reforms made public in October 1997 in Parliament,
your government is now engaged in an exercise preparing new draft,
" leader of the UNP Ranil Wickremesinghe said in a letter to
Kumaratunga on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been troubled by the long-running conflicts
between government troops and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (
LTTE) rebels who have been fighting for a separate homeland for
minority Tamils in the north and east of the island since 1983.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga has accused the UNP of holding up her
draft constitution to end the ethnic war by devolving more powers
to regional councils, including one in the northeast administered
by Tamils to partly meet LTTE's demand for independence.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Wickremesinghe said, "now that there is a clear
avenue to get our support, it is your responsibility to make use
of it."
</P>
<P>
In an unexpected move, Wickremesinghe on January 19 pledged his
party's support to the government's constitutional plan if some of
the opposition's own reform proposals were included.
</P>
<P>
Following the opposition's U-turn, the ruling People's Alliance
government decided late last month to present a draft constitution
in Parliament in three months.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Rice Export Falls Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar exported a total of 61,
800 tons of rice in the first 10 months of 1999, a drop of 21.57
percent over the same period of the previous year, according to
the latest figures of the country's Central Statistical
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar was once well known to the world for its high rice
production. Myanmar annually exported over 1 million tons in the
1950s. But in 1997, the country's rice export dropped to 16,600
tons, the lowest figures in history.
</P>
<P>
The sharp fall of Myanmar's rice export is reportedly due to no
much increase in the cultivated area of paddy. There was also less
output of paddy for a length of time while Myanmar's population
grows by 2 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
At present, Myanmar's population nears 50 million, two times
the figures in 1948 when Myanmar regained independence.
</P>
<P>
To meet the food demand of the increasing population, the
Myanmar government has, since January 1999, leased out 400,000
hectares of vacant and virgin lands for cultivation to private
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has also exempted import duties on
agricultural implements including machinery, pesticide and
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's cultivable land covers 18.22 million hectares, of
which 9.31 million hectares have been utilized with 8.91 million
hectares remaining to be reclaimed.

000 tons of various beans and pulses in the first 10 months of
1999, earning 191 million U.S. dollars of foreign exchange,
according to the latest figures of the official Economic
Indicators.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the export volume and foreign exchange
earnings respectively rose by 13.6 percent and 17.9 percent
compared with the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The indicators also show that in 1998, Myanmar exported a total
of 640,800 tons of different beans and pulses, gaining 193 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is an agricultural country with the export value of its
agricultural products accounting for 35 percent of the country's
total export value and the agricultural output value takes up 36
percent of the gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Foreign Debts Rise to 51 Bln U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' total foreign
debts rose to 51 billion U.S. dollars at the end of September 1999
from 48.13 billion dollars at end-June, Manila Bulletin newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted data from the Central Bank of the Philippines
as saying that 86 percent of the total foreign debts were medium-
to-long-term loans with the shortest maturity at three years. The
rest was short-term debt.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Buenaventua, governor of the central bank, said the
short-term debt was fully covered by the country's gross
international reserves (GIR) which stood at about 15 billion
dollars at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"If you have GIR two and a half times the size of your short-
term debt, then in any short-term crisis, there is no problem," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' interest payment for its foreign and local
debts is forecast to increase by almost 20 percent in 2000 to 127
billion pesos (3.2 billion dollars), the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government last year borrowed substantially from
the international market, including 400 million dollars in global
bonds floated last December.
</P>
<P>
It has also increased its domestic debt due to the issuance of
small denominated and fixed-rate treasury bonds in a bid to widen
the base of the domestic capital market.
</P>
<P>
The country's domestic debts totaled 634.9 billion pesos (15.9
billion dollars) as of September last year, said the paper.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Special
Representative for the Balkans Carl Bildt said Thursday that he is
deeply concerned over the situation in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said the increasing ethnic separation and hostility in
Kosovo has made the Yugoslav province "dangerous."
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Macedonia's capital Skopje, Bildt told
reporters that the situation in the region is "still dangerous"
because of the high jobless rate, a large number of refugees, and
ethnic separation advocated by some people.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said the security situation and ethnic hatred in Kosovo
are grave and the province is "full of dangers."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Bildt held talks with Macedonian President
Boris Traikovski and Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski.
</P>
<P>
Tension has risen in Kosovo recently between majority Albanians
and minority Serbs. Ethnic Albanian terrorists attacked a Serb bus
with rockets that was being escorted by KFOR peacekeeping soldiers
in the city of Mitrovica last week. Two people were killed and
many others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Following a two-month-long air-strike against Yugoslavia,
Kosovo has been under the administration of the U.N. Special
Mission for Kosovo since Yugoslavia withdrew its troops from the
area in June 1999.

ROME, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Italians are becoming more
worried over the crime rate while unemployment remains their top
concern, the latest findings said.

<P>
The National Council on Economy and Labor (Cnel), in
conjunction with Eurisko pollsters, surveyed 2,000 adults on what
their present priorities were.
</P>
<P>
While joblessness remains the top concern, one of four Italians
saw crime as a problem of ever growing urgency. Next came health
concerns.
</P>
<P>
The report said that unemployment worries were lower today than
they had been in 1998 as workers came to accept a more flexible
labor market.
</P>
<P>
Pollsters found unemployment was the biggest concern for 41
percent of those questioned, 5 percent down from just six months
ago and a drop of 10 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year there has been a 7 percent rise in concern

<HEADLINE> Mauritania Qualifies for Debt Relief Under HIPC Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank's
International Development Association (IDA) and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed Thursday to support Mauritania's
eligibility for a debt reduction package under the enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
</P>
<P>
In net present value terms, total relief from all of
Mauritania's creditors would amount to 622 million U.S. dollars,
equivalent to about 40 percent of total debt outstanding at the
end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
This is expected to translate into debt service relief over
time of approximately 1.1 billion dollars, which implies debt
service savings of roughly 36 million dollars per year over the
next 10 years, or 40 percent of total yearly debt service
obligations.
</P>
<P>
Under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, IDA's assistance to
Mauritania will amount to 185 million dollars while the IMF will
provide 50 million dollars. Mauritania's assistance under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative will be confirmed upon the granting of
comparable treatment assurances from the country's other creditors.
</P>
<P>
Resources made available from this debt relief will help
finance social expenditures, contributing to Mauritania's efforts
to reduce poverty, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Initiative was launched by the World Bank and the IMF
in 1996 as the first comprehensive effort to eliminate
unsustainable debt in the world's poorest, most heavily indebted
countries.
</P>
<P>
In October 1999, the international community agreed to major
enhancements designed to make the Initiative "broader, deeper and
faster" by increasing the number eligible countries, raising the
amount of debt relief each eligible country will receive, and
speeding up its delivery.
</P>
<P>
Mauritania has established a good track record of adjustment
and reform on the macroeconomic, social and political fronts, the
World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
Substantial structural reforms have been implemented and fiscal
consolidation has been achieved in the African country. Reflecting
this effort, the country's gross domestic product grew by an
annual average of close to 5 percent since 1992 and there has been
significant improvement in social indicators.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Soccer Fans Urged to Avoid Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
Indonesia (PSSI) has urged soccer fans nationwide to avoid
violence in matches.
</P>
<P>
"If soccer fans turn brutal and disrupt matches, they will
damage their clubs' prestige. Their behavior will also disgrace
the image of national soccer," Chairman of the PSSI Agum Gumelar
said.
</P>
<P>
Agum, who is also minister of communications, was referring to
soccer hooligans in Surabaya, capital of East Java, who disrupted
several matches featuring their favorite club Persebaya during the
sixth Indonesian Soccer League (Ligina).
</P>
<P>
Last month, Surabaya Police banned Persebaya from playing at
their home stadium. East Java Governor Imam Oetomo later supported
the police's decision.
</P>
<P>
Some soccer clubs in East Java have reportedly refused to
compete against Persebaya as they fear that their supporters will
run amok if their team is defeated.
</P>
<P>
Agum also warned that hooligans could be politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
"Let's not mix politics and sport. I hope soccer can lead the
people to more positive thoughts," he was quoted by the Jakarta
Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
It has been alleged that Surabaya hooligans had been organized
by people wishing to discredit Persebaya's chairman Sunarto
Sumoprawiro. Sunarto, who is also the Surabaya mayor, has
installed his brother Karwoto as the club's manager.
</P>
<P>
Agum said a team from PSSI would negotiate with Surabaya
security officers and local authorities and ask them to grant
permits for Persebaya to host soccer matches at their home stadium.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Surabaya soccer fans will realize that their bad
behavior will disgrace their own and the club's image," he said.
</P>
<P>
Should the security officers and authorities decline the
request, Agum said he would offer several options to the club.
</P>
<P>
"First, Persebaya can play their matches with no spectators in
an isolated stadium that cannot be reached easily by supporters,
for example in a military complex, until security officers and
authorities allow them to play in their hometown. Persebaya will
definitely suffer heavy financial losses but it will be their own
risk." he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Archery Upbeat Team to Qualify For Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Archery
Association (Perpani) is still optimistic that its women's team
will be able to qualify for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Perpani secretary-general Udi Harsono said that the
International Archery Federation (FITA) would announce which
countries would join the Olympics in the women's team event on
June 26.
</P>
<P>
"FITA is waiting for the results of the pre-Olympics qualifying
round in the Africa, Europe and Oceania zones," he was quoted by
the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which won its first Olympic silver medal in 1988 for
archery, has only qualified Hamdiah in the individual event after
competing in the World Championships in Riom, France, last year.
</P>
<P>
Based on FITA regulations, only 16 countries are allowed to
compete in the Olympics' team event. Eight countries have
qualified in the World Championships while two others qualified in
the America and Asia Championships.
</P>
<P>
The remaining six tickets will be given to countries who have
two athletes qualifying for the Olympics and one on the waiting
list or one athlete qualifying and two on the waiting list.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has Nurfitriyana and Lusia Elizabeth on the waiting
list.
</P>
<P>
Udi said Japan and Cuba had the best chance to qualify for the
first category while Indonesia still had an opportunity as it was
in the second position after Kazakhstan in the second category.
</P>
<P>
He said he would not worry that the results of the qualifying
round in the three zones would affect Indonesia's chances.
</P>
<P>
"I think only one European country will qualify while Africa
and Oceania countries have a very slight chance to get the
Olympics berths," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Perpani is still waiting for donations from the State
Secretary to be able to finance its training programs.
</P>
<P>
Former state secretary Muladi had approved help for Perpani,
especially after the organization had a debt of nearly 60 million
rupiah (8,000 U.S. dollars) in preparation for the World
Championships and the Asian Championships in Beijing last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Bad Loan Ratio Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- In a reversal of the steady
rise of bad loans, the Philippine banking industry's bad loan
ratio last December declined dramatically to 12.46 percent from
the previous month's 14.61 percent, the Business World said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the country's Central Bank Governor Rafael
Buenaventura as saying that the decline was the result of the
strong growth of banks' asset accounts, specifically their loan
portfolios, due to increased holiday spending.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura said total loans increased by "at least 5 percent
while bad loans had stayed at "more or less the same level (since
last November)."
</P>
<P>
As of end November last year, the total loan portfolio of the
commercial banking system stood at 1.552 trillion pesos (38.8
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
During the same period, commercial banks reported aggregate bad
loans of 226.7 billion pesos (5.67 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura expressed confidence that the decline of bad loan
ratio signals the beginning of renewed bank lending and stronger
asset quality for the banking system.
</P>
<P>
The central bank defines bad loans as accounts that have
remained unpaid for at least 90 days.
</P>
<P>
Bad loan ratio is the total bad loans over the total loan
portfolio of the country's commercial banks.

<HEADLINE> Italy Says Lower Adriatic Was Chemical Weapons Dump Until '70s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The lower Adriatic was a chemical
weapons dump until the beginning of the 1970s and corrosion
leading to the release of these deadly chemicals is jeopardizing
sea life in the waters, a document said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A report compiled by the Institute for Research At Sea (Icram),
commissioned by the Italian Ministry for Environment for a project
named Acab, says that chemical bombs, mines and artillery shells
left over from World War II were sunk in the lower Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
The report said that at least 20,000 devices containing 24
chemical substances have been found in the sea areas and of them "
18 are persistent and capable of producing harmful effects on the
environment."
</P>
<P>
With an undersea robot, the institute inspected 16 bombs, 11 of
which were corroded. Water samples taken in the proximity of the
weapons indicate "damage and risk for the marine ecosystem
resulting from persistent pollution released by the corroded
devices," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Two of the chemical substances detected were arsenic and
mustard gas.
</P>
<P>
Alarm over the state of the lower Adriatic was sounded recently
by Vice Environment Minister Valerio Calzolaio, who said during a
parliament hearing that between 1946 and 1997 these weapons
claimed the lives of five people and caused injuries to 236 others.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Questioned by Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman was questioned by police investigators Thursday for the
first time over his alleged financial irregularities of accepting
a large sum of cash gifts from a French millionaire, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The questioning took place at the President's House in
Jerusalem, as Weizman can decide where and when police may
question him because of his official role.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after the questioning, Weizman revealed
that the criminal investigation against him is only halfway down
the road and he expected to be questioned by police again on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The police declined to provide details of the questioning,
including whether Weizman was questioned "under caution", a legal
term which means that anything he said could later be used against
him in court.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's wife Reuma and director-general of the president's
residence Aryeh Shumer, president's top aide participated in
Thursday's police questioning.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, French millionaire businessman Edouard Saroussi,
who have donated at least 453,000 U.S. dollars to Weizman as "
gifts" between 1988 and 1993, was also questioned by Israeli
police in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The questioning of Saroussi was to determine the nature of his
financial transactions with Weizman and whether the two men had
business relations, which has huge legal importance in Weizman
case.
</P>
<P>
Since the launching of the investigation in mid-January,
Weizman's lawyer Hanina Brandes, who managed the president's
accounts related to Saroussi's money, and acquaintances of the
president have also been questioned.
</P>
<P>
The criminal probe, the first of its kind against a reigning
president in Israel's 52-year history, was launched by Israeli
Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein three weeks ago, after a
special police team presented him "alleged evidence of a
relationship of business" between Weizman and Saroussi.
</P>
<P>
Weizman was charged by investigation journalist Yoav Yitzhak at
the end of last year with receiving Saroussi's generous donation
when he was a Knesset (Parliament) member and cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
Weizman admitted that he received money from Saroussi, but less
than that alleged sum and Saroussi gave him the money as a
personal gift without political or business purpose.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the calls for Weizman's resignation are
intensifying because some law experts predicted that the probe
will lead to allegations against Weizman over bribery and tax
evasion.
</P>
<P>
However, Weizman dismissed widespread rumors that he would
resign or at least step aside temporarily from his largely
ceremonial post in a dramatic televised speech to the whole
country last month, saying that he did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
Elected president in 1993 and re-elected in 1998, Weizman was
one of the most outspoken and popular politicians in Israel. The
fighter-turned-peacemaker will end his second-term as president in
2003, if not resign because of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
As Weizman is committed to supporting peace talks with Arab
countries, some analysts have been worried that at such a critical
point of Middle East peace process, any embarrassment Weizman
faces in the financial scandal will do damage to the peace efforts.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Fights into African Nations Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Tijani Babangida scored two
times Thursday in Lagos for the co-host Nigeria in a game of the
22nd Africa Nations Cup, beating the cup hopeful South Africa by 2-
0.
</P>
<P>
Babangida's brilliant long distance shoot only 40 seconds after
the beginning of the match shocked the South Africans, who were
widely believed to be a daunting challenger on the Super Eagles'
pilgrim toward the top place in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The challenger darkened when Babangida pushed in his second
goal fifteen minutes before half-time, which seemed seal the co-
host an easy win.
</P>
<P>
The dominance of the eagles sent the 55,000 home fans in a
Lagos stadium, as well as large army of police around it ready for
possible turmoil, into kind of delirium.
</P>
<P>
The Bafana Bafana appeared to have once regrouped after the
first setback and launched some threatening offensives, but
Nigeria soon surprised again the South Africans with the speed of
their counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
The second half saw some opportunities for both sides to
enlarge or close the gap between the gap, but unfortunately they
were all squandered.
</P>
<P>
As the clock ticked away the South Africans frustration at
their inability to find the net began to show and by the final few
minutes they appeared thoroughly disheartened.
</P>
<P>
The sky now is cleared and this year's cup owner will certainly
come from either Nigeria or Cameroon, who today mercilessly beat
Tunisia 3-0 in Accra, another co-host state Ghana's capital. The
final showdown will be held Sunday in Lagos.

<HEADLINE> Cameroon Lions Beats Tunisia 3-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Tunisia Thursday got well beaten
by the lions of Cameroon in a semifinal of the 22nd African
Nations Cup held in co-host Ghana's capital Accra.
</P>
<P>
Two goals from Patrick Mboma, and one from Samuel Eto'o bought
the lions well deserved tickets for Sunday's finals in Lagos
against the co-host Nigeria's Super Eagles.
</P>
<P>
The cup hopeful South Africa Thursday was also 0-2 thoroughly
beaten by the Super Eagles of Nigeria before the frantic Nigerian
fans in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The Indomitable Lions broke the deadlock in about 23rd minute
of the second half, while Eto'o drove home Cameroon's second with
nine minutes to go. Four minutes later Mboma added his second.
</P>
<P>
The first half was a poor spectacle with the crowd showing
their lack of enthusiasm by whistling as half time approached.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the second half, the Tunisians did make
some opportunities but simply could not find the net before their
net were widely open to the lions.

<P>
CANBERRA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the
country's highest corporate regulator, is investigating possible
breaches of the law in the collapse of the National Textiles
company.
</P>
<P>
The Canberra Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Prime Minister John Howard launched an
extraordinary offensive Thursday against suggestions that he had
bailed out the workers at the National Textiles because his
brother was chairman, branding the suggestion a "despicable slur."
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia faces a defense bill of up to 106 billion
Australian dollars (70 billion U.S. dollars) over the next 20
years just to replace obsolescent front-line fighter planes and
warships, new Secretary of the Department of Defense Allan Hawke
said in a confidential speech.
</P>
<P>
-- Rupert Murdoch's News Corp propelled Australia's share
market to a record close Thursday after investors ignored a poor
profit result and added another 7.2 billion Australian dollars (4.
75 billion U.S. dollars) to the media giant's market value.

<HEADLINE> Collymore: I Want to be the Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Controversial striker Stan
Collymore said that he could become the best goal-scorer in
Britain after sealing his transfer from Aston Villa to Leicester
City.
</P>
<P>
Collymore has signed an 18-month 'incentive-based' contract
which involves a considerable cut from his 20,000 pounds-a-week
salary at Villa Park where his career stalled.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old will be in the squad for Leicester's game
against Watford on Saturday and could make his first top-flight
appearance for nine months.
</P>
<P>
"It is a little bit bitter-sweet to be here. People know the
circumstances of my leaving Villa and it is a sad day in that
respect," said Collymore.
</P>
<P>
"That chapter is now closed. It is time to move on and play
well for Leicester."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, most people regard taking me on as a risk, for
whatever reasons, but it's a case of me forgetting the hype and
getting on with my football.
</P>
<P>
"I want to play well and score goals. I want to be regarded as
one of the best goalscorers in the country."
</P>
<P>
Collymore also said he hoped Aston Villa now went on to win the
FA and insisted manager John Gregory had wished him well at his
new employers.
</P>
<P>
Leicester's manager Martin O'Neill told the press conference he
did not believe the signing was a gamble.
</P>
<P>
"I do not consider this to be a risk. There is a risk in terms
of football but not if he gets himself fit," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Celtic director of football
operations Kenny Dalglish slammed Thursday the Parkhead players
after the dismissal of head coach John Barnes.
</P>
<P>
The former England international was relieved of his duties
along with assistant Eric Black and Terry McDermott following the
embarrassing 3-1 Scottish Cup defeat by Inverness Caledonian
Thistle.
</P>
<P>
And Dalglish, who takes temporary charge of the team, insisted
that the players themselves had to look at their own part in
Barnes' downfall. Dalglish said: "The biggest component is results.
The people most responsible for results are the players."
</P>
<P>
He added: "A month ago, John Barnes received the Manager of the
Month award because of tremendous performances by the players
during that month.
</P>
<P>
"But, as one person once said, players can gain you success and
gain you the sack. We ourselves and everybody must look at
themselves with a certain amount of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"The players have to look at themselves and realize that this
club demands passion and commitment.
</P>
<P>
"The supporters demand that the players who wear the shirt wear
it with pride. We want players who are totally committed. If they
aren't they don't deserve to be here," he said.

MOSCOW, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops
discovered two railcars with the remains of 154 people when they
were combing Grozny, the capital city of the Chechen republic, a
senior military official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel-General Valery Manilov, deputy chief of General Staff
said the remains could be the bodies of Russian soldiers killed in
the previous Chechen war of 1994-1996.
</P>
<P>
The remains, which were badly decomposed because electricity to
the refrigerated cars was switched off, will be sent to Rostov, a
city in southwest Russia, for expert identification.
</P>
<P>
"Talks were conducted with the Chechen leadership about car
loads of bodies during the previous campaign, but we didn't get
their consent for transporting them to Rostov," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
"We still have no certain grounds that they are the remains of
soldiers who fell in the first war," the Interfax news agency
quoted Manilov as saying.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Puts Off Visit to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 11 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General George
Robertson has postponed his planned visit to Moscow, a senior
Russian military official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The trip, which was scheduled for mid-February, "is likely to
take place later," said Colonel-General Valery Manilov, deputy
chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Services, the Itar-
Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Manilov did not say what prompted the postponement, but the
Interfax news agency, citing military and diplomatic sources,
reported Thursday there were differences over the contents of a
joint document to be signed during the trip.
</P>
<P>
Moscow froze its ties with NATO when the alliance launched the
78-day air campaign against Yugoslavia, but limited contacts were
resumed on the peacekeeping operation in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Moscow wants the document to set out the current state of their
relations and the reasons behind the "freezing" in them, Interfax
said.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed that restoration of ties with NATO must be
predicated on two conditions: interaction within the framework of
the Kosovo peacekeeping must be intensified to fully implement U.N.
Security Council Resolution 1244 and joint decisions must be
reached on the most important aspects of European security.
</P>
<P>
NATO, however, insists that the document to be adopted in
Moscow must unambiguously announce the complete restoration of
relations between Russia and NATO without mentioning the reasons
why they were "frozen" in the first place.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Manilov said Moscow views Robertson as "a realistic
and quite constructive politician," that that "his visit will be
instrumental in restoration of bilateral dialogue, but only if
certain conditions are observed."
</P>
<P>
He laid out the three conditions as "the new essence of
cooperation" between the two sides:
</P>
<P>
-- Russia and NATO should be equally involved in assessment of
situation in crisis areas and elaboration of conclusions of such
assessments.
</P>
<P>
-- They should have equal rights in deciding on how to react to
crisis situations.
</P>
<P>
-- The parties should take equal part in implementation of
joint decisions concerning reaction to these situations.
</P>
<P>
"Only these conditions can serve as the basis for negotiations
between Russia and NATO and for... re-establishment and dynamic
development of relations," Tass quoted Manilov as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This principle was written into the Founding Act on NATO-
Russia relations, but was grossly violated during NATO's
aggression against Yugoslavia," he stressed.

</P>
<P>
The request is part of the recent agreement signed by the two
countries through an exchange of notes between Spadafora and U.S.
Ambassador Simon Ferro.
</P>
<P>
"Part of the 1.6 billion dollars the U.S. government donated to
Colombia for its fight against drug trafficking was given to the
countries bordering with that country, one of them Panama," said
Spadafora.
</P>
<P>
Spadafora said that Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso sent
Washington a list of her logistical priorities to fight drug
trafficking, which has made this nation the main center for its
illicit activities.
</P>
<P>
The list of the most urgent needs Panama presented to the
United States adds up to 30 million dollars, said the minister of
Government and Justice.
</P>
<P>
Spadafora said that the Panamanian authorities foresee in their
anti-drug plans the training of the members of its security
agencies by U.S. specialized organizations, and the exchange of
information.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. chief anti-drug policymaker Barry McCaffrey
said on Tuesday during his Mexican tour, that Latin America's drug
cartels are switching their smuggling routes back through the
Caribbean. He said the drug cartels have turned to Panama after
the United States pulling out from there.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Leaving U.S. National Reform Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Minnesota Governor Jesse
Ventura said Friday that he is leaving the U.S. national Reform
Party.
</P>
<P>
"Based on what I have seen in prior years and especially in
recent months, I have come to believe that the national Reform
Party is hopelessly dysfunctional," Ventura said.
</P>
<P>
"It is unworthy of my support and the support of the American
people," he said at a news conference in his governor's office in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
Ventura, the highest-ranking elected official in the Reform
Party, said he wanted the Minnesota state party to vote to leave
the national organization as soon as possible and to reclaim the
name Independent Party.
</P>
<P>
Ventura said the national organization was so riven by internal
strife that it was hurting efforts by the state party and others
to build a strong independent political movement.
</P>
<P>
Ventura has been butting heads with another faction of the
national organization aligned with party founder Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
The infighting flared over the issue of the location of the
nominating convention in August. Ventura's faction wants it held
in Minnesota, while Perot's faction insists on Long Beach,
California.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also have split over whom to support for
presidential nomination. Perot royalists want to support Patrick
Puchanan, a conservative former Republican now seeking the Reform
nomination, while Ventura group back multimillionaire Donald Trump
from New York.
</P>
<P>
The infighting has made the party's presidential race in
trouble, but the party still could have a significant impact in
this year's presidential election, since its nominee will receive
12.6 million dollars in federal campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Reform Party members, Ventura ally and state
chairman Rick McCluhan said he had given up hope of a compromise
with national leaders on the site of the 2000 convention.
</P>
<P>
Ventura's departure came as Perot's group is to meet Saturday
in Nashville, Tennessee, in an effort to oust national Reform
Party Chairman Jack Gargan, who was backed by Ventura.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: N.Irish Assembly Suspended By Huang Xingwei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Direct rule was re-imposed in
Northern Ireland on Friday despite a last-minute Sinn Fein bid to
break the deadlock over arms.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said there had been
some progress in discussions aimed at halting the process of
suspending the Assembly, but not enough.
</P>
<P>
Minutes earlier, Gerry Adams, leader of the Irish Republican
Army's Sinn Fein political wing, said a "new and significant
proposition to resolve the arms issue" has been put to the British
and Irish governments.
</P>
<P>
Adams, describing the plan as of "enormous significance", said
the IRA would "set out the context in which it will deal with the
issue of arms".
</P>
<P>
Despite the suspension, Mandelson suggested the issue could be
resolved "very quickly indeed".
</P>
<P>
"We must clear up the issue of decommissioning once and for all
- it has dogged the peace process. It is difficult to gage exactly
what is on offer from Sinn Fein and the IRA," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said he regretted the fact
suspension had become necessary.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear exactly what will happen next but there will
probably be another review after a short breathing space to
consult all sides.
</P>
<P>
Adams, in his statement just before suspension was announced,
said "Sinn Fein's concern is to see this issue settled in such a
way as to ensure maximum public confidence in the process and
resolve the issue of arms in a complete way.
</P>
<P>
"When set alongside the IRA's recent assertion that the peace
process is under no threat from it, and that its guns are silent,
this new development takes on an enormous significance, and can,
if there is the political will and good will, finally resolve the
matter."
</P>
<P>
The crisis threatening the fragile peace process has been
brought about by the lack of progress on arms decommissioning and
in particular the absence of any handover of IRA weapons.
</P>
<P>
Trimble had said he would resign as Assembly First Minister if
disarmament did not begin.
</P>
<P>
His resignation would have collapsed the institutions and made
it much harder to get them up again.
</P>
<P>
Britain's decision to freeze the home-rule government came on
the eve of a convention of the powerful Ulster Unionist Party at
which UUP leader David Trimble has said he would announce his
resignation as First Minister of the province in protest at IRA
refusal to hand in arms.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Britain's forthcoming suspension of Northern
Irish Assembly was aimed at avoiding the resignation of the
province's Protestant first minister of the coalition government,
Trimble.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said there had
been progress on the issue of Irish republican guerrilla
disarmament, but not enough to stop the suspension of Northern
Ireland home rule.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly there has been progress in the discussions that have
been taking place, but the clarity that was called for was not
there when (Northern Ireland Secretary) Peter Mandelson made his
decision," said a spokesman for Blair.
</P>
<P>
Blair's reaction came minutes after Mandelson announced that
Britain was resuming direct rule in Northern Ireland after failing
to get a breakthrough from the Irish Republican Army(IRA) on
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Ireland said on Friday that it had
received an updated report from the head of Northern Ireland's
independent disarmament body. An Irish government source as saying
that the report was "very significant".
</P>
<P>
The source said the report would be released later on Friday,
together with a joint statement from the Irish and British prime
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace process was plunged into crisis
following the initial report written at the end of January by
retired Canadian General John de Chastelain, who heads the arms
decommissioning body, which said the IRA failed to make progress
on disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean, S. African Presidents to Meet Every 6 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe and his visiting South African counterpart Thabo Mbeki
Friday agreed to meet every six months to estimate the cooperation
between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks in the Zimbabwean capital Harare, the two
presidents discussed areas of cooperation that were proposed at
their last meeting.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 projects in tourism, transport, energy and trade
were proposed at a similar summit in Pretoria, South Africa, late
last year.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters on the talks, Zimbabwean Minister of
Industry and Commerce Nathan Shemuyarire said that Mugabe and
Mbeki have agreed to meet every six months to take stock of the
progress on the proposed projects.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between the two southern African countries was
meant to broaden the 1964 trade agreement which was narrowed to a
few goods.
</P>
<P>
Shemuyarire said that the two countries plan to jointly
establish a gas extraction project at Lupane of west Zimbabwe and
to establish an industrial park at Ruwa, east of the capital
Harare.
</P>
<P>
Progress has been registered in the transport sector through
the building of the Bulawayo-Beitbridge Railway Line that linked
South Africa and Zimbabwe, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two presidents also discussed progress on the
work being undertaken to establish trans-frontier conservation
areas in Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe and Kruger National
Park in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Shemuyarire said that Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority
officials will next week visit their South African counterparts to
discuss about the continued supply of electricity for Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has considered the request from Zimbabwe for the
provision of, not just power, but also fuel, the Zimbabwean
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is currently reeling under a crippling fuel shortage
that is threatening to ground its economic activities, and
negotiations are in progress for South African companies to help
source cheap fuel for this country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe also imports electricity from South Africa's Eskom
which recently threatened to cut off power supplies to Zimbabwe
over the debt.
</P>
<P>
But sources at the meeting said that Zimbabwe paid something in
January, earning a short reprieve from imminent power cuts.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki arrived in Harare Friday for a brief visit to hold
crucial investment and trade talks with Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the meeting focused on the South
African government's endeavors to assist its northern neighbor and
largest African trading partner solve its critical fuel and energy
shortages.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki left here for home on Friday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall Sharply On Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
sharply Friday as a U.S. company made negative comments on
Microsoft's new Window 2000 software, which is scheduled for
release next week after a long-time delay.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 218.42 at 10,452.
21, falling 11 percent from its January 14 record. The blue chip
index moved into a correction.
</P>
<P>
A drop of 10 percent was considered a correction under rule of
thumb. But it's not necessary to mark a long-term change for the
market trend.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index plunged after the Gartner Group, an information
technology consulting firm, said many companies would likely
experience problems once they install Microsoft's new Windows 2000
software.
</P>
<P>
The comments also hit other indexes heavily. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 90.18 at 4,395.45 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 29.71 at 1,387.12.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index also suffered from profit-taking. Investors
sold technology stocks to lock in profits from the recent strong
rallies.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index has gained four record highs so far this month,
playing a dominant role in the stock market. The index rose 85.6
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 9.97 at 604.46 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 3.52 at 889.47. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 5.11 at 537.10.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange. NYSE volume declined to 1.02 billion
shares from 1.05 billion in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Price Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan oil price reached
24.96 U.S. dollars per barrel from February 7 to 11, increasing 21
cents, compared with the previous week, said the Ministry of
Energy and Mines on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In January, the average price of oil for export stood at 23.37
dollars per barrel, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to talks among Saudi Arabia, Mexico and
Venezuelan disclosed that the three major exporters agreed to
boost output in order to calm the world market.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices in the past month have swung from 23 dollars to 27
dollars a barrel. Traders are watching if the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and major independent
producers will abandon current quotas and pump more oil to curb
spiraling prices.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, Venezuelan and OPEC last April slashed output by 7
percent of world supply to end an oil glut and revive prices that
fell below 10 dollars a barrel in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> France Worried About Risks of Escalation in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- France has expressed its concern
about the risks of an escalation in Lebanon, after Israel made
several air raids following the death of an Israeli soldier who
was killed by Hezbollah guerrillas early Friday.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
that it is more emergent than ever that all the parties exercise
with a great sense of responsibilities and strictly respect the
1996 arrangement, which calls on both Israel and the Hezbollah to
avoid attacking civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
France also calls for the holding of a new meeting as soon as
possible of the monitoring group of the 1996 arrangement, which
consists of France, the United States, Israel, Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel walked out of a meeting of the group on Friday after the
Hezbollah killed one more Israeli soldier, adding the number of
the dead of Israeli troops to nine in the past two weeks in the
Israeli-occupied security zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation against the new attack by Hezbollah, Israel has
made nine air raids so far Friday against targets in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In an action in violation of the 1996 arrangement, Israeli
warplanes destroyed three electricity centers in Lebanon this week

<HEADLINE> U.S. Imposes Tariffs on Steel Rod, Pipe Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has decided to impose higher tariffs on steel rod and line pipe
imports in a bid to help U.S. firms hit by low-cost imports, the
White House announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government will impose the tariffs on imported steel
wire rod, which is used to make hangers, cables and fasteners, as
well as imported line pipe, according to draft White House
statements.
</P>
<P>
U.S. steelmakers in May 1999 asked the Clinton administration
to limit imports of carbon and alloy steel wire rod that have
flooded the U.S. market as a result of the Asian financial crisis.
Japan's trade minister had warned that tariffs could spark a
protectionist backlash and undermine U.S.-Japan' efforts to free
up trade.
</P>
<P>
In the draft statements, the White House said Clinton would
impose a 10 percent tariff on imports of steel wire rod above 1.58
million net tons in the first year. In the second and third years,
the quantity of imports exempt from the higher duty will rise by
two percent per year and the level of the tariff will fall by 2.5
percentage points per year. It did not specify which countries
would be subject to the new tariff.
</P>
<P>
The statements said imports of line pipe above 9,000 net tons
from any country would be subject to an additional 19 percent ad
valorem tariff in the first year. In the second year this would
drop to 15 percent and in the third year to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
U.S. steelmakers welcomed the decision, though some had pressed
for higher duties.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls on Syria, Israel to Keep Restraint on Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Friday urged Israel and Syria to resume peace talks amid
recently intensified violence along the Lebanon south border.
</P>
<P>
"it seems to me that it is a sober reminder of why we ought to
resume the peace process with great determination," Clinton said
at the White House. "The comprehensive peace between Syria and
Lebanon and Israel is the only way, ultimately, to resolve the
continuing difficulties over many years now along the border."
</P>
<P>
Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas have exchanged fires
for several days with Hezbollah using rockets and mortars to
attack Israel's army base and Israel launching its heaviest air
raids in eight months, destroying three power stations. The
violence sparked international anxiety over the future of Syrian-
Israeli peace talks, stalled since January.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said both Syria and Israel were interested in getting
an agreement and they were trying to keep restraint.
</P>
<P>
But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright laid the blame on
Syria and Hezbollah, saying Syria should do more to curb the
Lebanese guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
"I have talked to the Syrian foreign minister about using all
possible influence that they might have to restrain them (
Hezbollah guerrillas),"Albright told a sidewalk news conference on
Capital Hill after testifying on the Clinton administration's
request for $22.8 billion for international spending next year.
</P>
<P>
She made implicit criticism of the Syrians, saying: "They have
tried, but they need to work harder."
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said Syria has "
influence with Hezbollah." "At this point, it is our view that
the evidence is clear they need to exercise their influence more
effectively," he added.
</P>
<P>
With fear rising that the recent fighting would destroy hopes
for resuming Syrian-Israeli talks, the United States said it would
send Middle East envoy Dennis Ross to the region next week.

<HEADLINE> Colombia to Ask for Admission Into NAFTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pastrana said during the closing of a forum on competitivity
and productivity that he will make the request to the U.S.
government before the end of talks for the Free Trade Area of the
Americas (FTAA).
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said that the proposal might create "doubts" in some
Colombian sectors, but added that he is confident that with the
entrance of Colombia to NAFTA, "a true jump will be made and we
will be part of the great revolution that is occurring in the
world and that threatens to leave us out of it."
</P>
<P>
He underscored as an example of this the achievements made by
Mexico in foreign investment and in its exports after its entrance
to NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
According to Pastrana, if Colombia enters the trade agreement,
the country will have a bigger economic development and will face
the challenges of international competition.
</P>
<P>
Canada, the United States, and Mexico make up now the North
America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

<HEADLINE> France Denies Troops Replaced by British in Kosovo City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- France denied on Friday that its
troops deployed in the northern Kosovo city of Kosovska Mitrovica
have been replaced by the British.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted French Defense Minister Alain
Richard as saying in Sarajevo, Bosnia, where he was making a visit,
that the British are not replacing but reinforcing their French
counterparts of the Kosovo Force (KFOR).
</P>
<P>
"You know that we want that different contingents cooperate
within the KFOR,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Richard said that the situation in Kosovska Mitrovica is for
the moment different from other parts of Kosovo, so it is in the
interests of all not to leave the French alone in this situation.
</P>
<P>
Eight people were reportedly killed and many injured in two
days of clashes between ethnic Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo
city last week.
</P>
<P>
The French troops have been until now in charge of the security
in the city, which is divided by a river into two separate parts
dominated by Serbs and Albanians respectively.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kosovska Mitrovica said that British troops have
taken over the positions of the French mainly around a bridge
dividing the city.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. newspaper Washington Post has accused French troops of
refusing to help the United Nations police force in the city
during last week's clashes.
</P>
<P>
France rejected the accusation and argued that the French
troops have done a better job than other NATO troops deployed in
four other areas of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government Asks Guerrillas to Stop Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Colombian
Development Minister Jaime Alberto Cabal called Friday on the
guerrilla factions to put an end to their attacks to the national
electricity system, because they thwart the reactivation of the
productive sector.
</P>
<P>
National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas dynamited Friday in
the early morning 14 towers of support of energy lines in the
department of Antioquia in the northwest of the country, where
this terrorist action caused blackouts in the city of Medellin and
in other towns.
</P>
<P>
The minister condemned the attacks and called them deplorable
in moments in which businessmen want to work and the economy is
showing signals of reactivation.
</P>
<P>
The ELN, the second biggest guerrilla organization in the
country after the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC),
opposes the privatization of the electricity enterprises and
demand a dialogue of peace with the government that will include
the creation of a demilitarized zone.
